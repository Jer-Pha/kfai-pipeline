I would right now say that as well with the you know the asterisk of like I want to be able to change my answer as I work on the platinum and continue side questing and think more about it and get a chance to digest a bit more but blessing where do you come down to any of that conversation it's a it's a question that I feel unequipped to answer because I think well I I think it's the thing of what do you",
