            "text": "neon white is great this is an fps with a twist it's built from the ground up for speedrunning get from one end of the level to the other using weapons abilities and your wits to muster the best time possible but neon white staggers its gameplay mechanics brilliantly as it slowly layers on new enemies and weapons and it all culminates in levels that can only be described as controlled chaos and it's absolutely exhilarating while the game plays the star the story is a good framework for the action to be honest the story wasn't my cup of tea but i can see a lot of people really digging it but generally speaking this game is overflowing with style just look at this hud this is so unnecessary but i love it if you're remotely into games like ghost runner hotline miami or katana zero you're going to love this game so if any of that sounds interesting to you buy it because",
