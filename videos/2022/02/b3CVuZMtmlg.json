            "text": "eldon ring is amazing from software's latest title is ambitious and way bigger than you might think it is not only is the map expansive but there are so many levels of verticality when you're in the open world make sure you explore every nook and cranny because you're bound to find an entrance to caves catacombs or mining tunnels these mini dungeons can be really challenging and just when you might think that they're starting to look and feel the same from software introduces really fun ways to change up the formula and i love how they're able to seamlessly tie game design and mechanics into lore and story moments boss fights are still hard as however they're more approachable than ever with lots of options for assistance not only can you summon spirits that you fought or found along the way but some boss fights will have random npc summits waiting at the entrance in case you want extra help to join the fight it's wildly impressive the amount of things you can hack in slash at i'm 52",
