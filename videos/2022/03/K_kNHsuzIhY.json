            "text": "tunic is five out of five amazing you take on the role of a cute little fox in this isometric adventure it starts off pretty paint by numbers get your sword your shield and then go find the three all-powerful stones or gems or triforce pieces you get you get the picture luckily there's some pretty surprising twists and turns that kept me invested combat's fun and engaging it's pretty much what if dark souls but zelda or is that alden ring you're encouraged to use your weapons and items but unfortunately sticking to an archaic equip system makes things really difficult to swap especially during combat if the game gets too tough you can turn on tunic's invincibility mode or another mode where your stamina bar is always full spoilers it gets real tough in my opinion what makes tunic really special are these collectible instruction manual pages you find along the way what at first seemed like nothing really but a cute gimmick and that shit's real cute it also helps you understand more",
