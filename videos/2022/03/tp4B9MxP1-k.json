            "text": "memoir blue is okay described by its creators as an interactive poem a memoir blue exists somewhere between an animated short and a narrative adventure like florence as the player you move ice cubes to the bottom of a glass or peel posters off of a wall to change the state of the scene and have miriam's introspective dream about her relationship with her mother play out you move to the next scene do that one's interactions and the story continues i cried at the end of a memoir blue but wasn't enthralled for the full 45 minutes or so it took to roll credits the activities i took part in weren't always that interesting so i found my mind wandering as i smoothed out images i could already decipher miriam's story is sad but pretty mundane when it comes to drama unless i miss the symbolism of a big twist but that would just speak to the tale being too nebulous there's a great soundtrack here fantastic animation in two different styles and striking visuals that had me grabbing screenshots",
