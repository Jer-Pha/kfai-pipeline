            "text": "we recommend uncharted the legacy of thieves collection if you don't know it's a bundle that contains both uncharted 4 a thief's end and uncharted the lost legacy and it's out this friday the ps5 upgrades have some new performance modes like 4k 30fps mode a dynamic resolution 60fps mode and a 1080p 120 fps mode each mode has their ups and downs but i would personally recommend the 60fps mode 4k 30 is a little choppy for my tastes and to be honest i think 120 frames per second for a game like uncharted is a little overkill load times are great on the ps5 taking about 2 seconds to load up the games compared to the ps4's on average 24 second load times and that's why",
