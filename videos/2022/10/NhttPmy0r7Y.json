I want the haptics I want the cool thing I'll wait until I can get a PlayStation 5 I can walk in Walmart get it maybe I'm trying to get it for uh Christmas the holidays whatever you want to call them maybe that gets in the way and then also as we're going to get into here as we start talking about our preview of it no spoilers of course don't worry about it is this game dramatically different enough from God of War 2018. and how will that shake out in reviews of course the reviews for 2018",
