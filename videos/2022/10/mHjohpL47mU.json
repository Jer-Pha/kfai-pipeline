            "text": "I played two and a half hours of Gotham Knights and it was fun but some aspects left me wanting more Gotham Knights has potential with a solid evolving combat system and beloved villains that have me super interested to see what Batman Left Behind after his death story and the world are definitely the shining stars here of course straightforward melee combat badass takedown animations and cool gadgets are great too but repetitive enemy encounters and Arena style battles feel dated in design and flatly familiar in execution at times I can only break a big grunt Shield so many times before I'm bored of it and while I love seeing Harley Quinn's Story play out the bigger set pieces felt like more of the same instead of a new thrill optional multiplayer makes getting through enemies much more of a breeze as you can easily divide and conquer rooms but easier isn't always better either way it feels like a lot of thought went into making sure both single player and multiplayer are valid",
