            "text": "this game took me by surprise in such a way animal well is a 10 out of 10 Masterpiece no way really absolutely every single moment in this game even when I was completely and utterly lost I was having so much fun and also extremely frightened for what is going to come next it is not a perfect game but I don't think I've played a game in the last decade that is as close to being perfect as this game and that's that's truly what I feel about it you're you're learning the language of what this game is and what the developer wants you to absorbed from it it just gets more and more brilliant and surprising as you keep on going I love experiencing a moment or like God that is so smart I think it's so like an amazingly designed game but I think it was a bit uneven in spots I give this game uh an 8.5 out of 10 right on the precipice of being amazing",
