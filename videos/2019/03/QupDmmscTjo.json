But, unlike what we would have expected, the game isn\u2019t only going to be sold on the Microsoft store, but also on Steam. With this move, along with the rumors of Game Pass coming to the Switch and with Project XCloud bringing XBox games to mobile, it seems like Microsoft isn\u2019t very interested on controlling the platforms in which it releases its games. Taking this into account, coupled with the fact that the XBox One hasn\u2019t been selling all that much, how likely do you think it is that XBox will just become a third-party developer?  - Ignacio Rojas\n00:22:40 - Borderlands 3!\n00:24:35 Best Friend Q. - Question whether or not we really need another Borderlands - Alex Russ (Zero Syndicate)\n00:29:52 Best Friend Q. - Conspiracy theorist Gearbox Software/Xbox - ReclusiveDragon\n00:32:01 -  Jade Raymond Joins Google Gaming, GIB\n00:34:20 -  SEGA Judgement, Sal Romano @ Gematsu\n00:38:12 - Brendan Greene Speaks!\n00:42:00 - RUMOR: Sony in talks to buy Take Two\n00:52:25 - Hims\n00:53:25 - Out today\nReader mail   -\n00:55:30 - When we do get to an all digital future, people say the digital prices will fall, like we saw on pc, but with consoles only having one store front what incentive does the console manufacturers have to actually lower the prices on the games? - Style65\n01:04:25 - Squad Up: Jonathan Dixon (Xbox) - ZombieJonDixon\n01:06:26 - You\u2018re Wrong\nTomorrow\u2019s host:\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunnygames?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunnygames\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller and Tim Gettys talk about the biggest stories in Video Games.\n\nBackground Wall Art by Orioto - https://www.facebook.com/OriotoPosters/",
