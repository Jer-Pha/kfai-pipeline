I was wondering how you got into your niche of games journalism from a business perspective. Was your background in business? -  Weissmark\n00:05:48 - Housekeeping\nKC on March 30th, NYC 4/6, Vancouver 5/4 kindafunny.com/events\nThank you to our Patreon Producers: Mohammed Mohammed, Tom Bock, and Black Jack\nThe Roper Report   -\n00:07:40 - Nindies Report (Kirk and Katie)\n00:16:49 Best Friend Q. - What does Xbox Brining CupHead mean for GamesPass and with integrating Xbox live can we expect achievements on these games as well? - Brian Scollo\n00:18:30 - Stadia Internet Speeds, Maddy Myers @ Kotaku interviewing Phil Harrison\n00:26:38 Best Friend Q. - In an interview with Kotaku Phil Harrison stated that the recommended speed to stream content with Stadia is 25MBPs for 1080p 60FPS, and 4k at 30MBPs. By comparison Xbox Live recommends 3MBPs for gaming and 3.5MBPs for HD Video. However, the 25MBPs speed is comparable to 4K recommended speeds from Netflix. With that information it doesn't seem that Stadia can really boast to play on any network and becomes a specialty use case scenario. Do you think that perhaps this is a Specialty User focused product (Early adopters of iDevices, and 4K experiences)? - Alex Russ (Zero Syndicate)\n00:29:35 - Lucasfilm Games Lives! Fraser Brown @ PC Gamer\n00:35:31 - NPD for February, Matthew Handrahan @GIB\n00:39:02 - NEW APEX LEGENDS CHARACTER MIGHT BE A REFERENCE TO A TITANFALL 2 SPEEDRUNNER, Joe Skrebbels @ IGN\n00:40:45 - Out today\n00:42:17 -  ROBINHOOD\n00:43:16 - THIRDLOVE\nReader mail   -\n00:44:22 - Could Stadia first-party studio potentially divide the audience enough where first-party exclusives are less and less profitable? Could that then lead to less AAA exclusives per platform for future generations? Thoughts? - Daniel Summers\n00:49:50 - Why are some people so dismissive of Stadia? - Amon\n00:51:57 - With the releases of DMC5, Anthem, The Division 2, Sekiro, and Days Gone all being games I should love, I can't convince myself to purchase the games if I can't play them. What the hell do you guys do to pull yourselves out of these ruts? - Ya boi Morgan\n00:55:37 - Squad Up: Andrew(XBox) - lStarTrooperl (yes those are \u201cL\u2019s\u201d)\n00:57:25 - You\u2018re Wrong\nTomorrow\u2019s host:Greg and Xavier Woods\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunnygames?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunnygames\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller and Tim Gettys talk about the biggest stories in Video Games.\n\nBackground Wall Art by Orioto - https://www.facebook.com/OriotoPosters/",
