    "description": "Gen returns to Cooking with Greggy to make her bread, and this time, she's sober!\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n3 \u00bd cups (525 g) unbleached all-purpose flour\n1 \u00bd tsp salt\n\u00bd tsp instant dry yeast\n1 \u00be cups (430 ml) cold water\n\nCoating\n1/3 cup (50 g) whole wheat flour\n\nPREPARATION\n-In a large pot, combine the flour, salt and yeast. Add the water. With a fork, stir until the flour is completely moistened, but not necessarily smooth. Cover and let rise at room temperature for 8 to 12 hours, or overnight.\n\n-In a large bowl, place the whole wheat flour. Set aside.\n\n-With your hands, directly in the pot, fold the risen dough onto itself, about 6 times, or until it is smooth.\n-Transfer the dough into the bowl with the whole wheat flour and turn to coat the entire surface of the dough. Cover and let rise for 45 minutes at room temperature or until it has doubled in volume.\n-Meanwhile, with the rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F (225\u00b0C). Place a 12-cup (3 litre) Dutch oven or ovenproof pot with its lid (not glass) in the oven, and heat for about 30 minutes.\n-Remove the pot\u2019s lid. Drop the floured bread dough in the centre of the hot pot. Cover and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and continue baking for 30 minutes.\n-Let the bread cool on a wire rack or in the pot. Remove any excess flour.\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunny\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller, Tim Gettys, and Nick Scarpino talk about the biggest stories in nerd culture.\n\nMusic by Tonedeff - http://www.QN5.com",
