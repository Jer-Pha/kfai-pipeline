In the past Microsoft had stated as well that games in gamepass generally lead to higher sales. This leads me to wonder why Sony hasn't seemed to make any changes too PS Now as a reaction? As the service seems stagnated in comparison to GamePass. As PS Now, still can't download PS3 games, PS Now still lacks recent hits such as the new God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc. - Parker Petrov\n00:48:00 - Why are people so quick to do these heinous acts?
