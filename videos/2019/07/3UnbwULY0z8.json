Craig Pat your director of lion Research Center at the University of Minnesota the bottom of this carnivore conundrum quote the females in a pride are all closely related to each other explains dr. Packer quote they're sisters cousins grandmothers nieces and aunts so if Nala and Simba were not litter mates there is a chance they'd have the same father but it's the mothers who would have been as close as sisters or cousins the answer then to our pressing question is yes Simba and Nala are related because their moms are related now",
