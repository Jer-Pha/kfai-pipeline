Can we have a bit more on how the sausage gets made for e3 judges week? Do you have to book your own appointments? Do you get unlimited time with the games on display? How many people are there? You must be embargoed up the wazoo, does it not deflate the hype of the press conferences?\nThanks for reading- Andrea looking forward to seeing you in London in a wee while, and Greg you suck #KFAFForStreamys\u201d\n00:46:59 - David Scott - \u201cWhat\u2019s Good Greg and Andrea? With the announcement that Microsoft and PlayStation are partnering for backend development. Do you guys think this is due to the threat of Stadia? Or do you think this is possibly a hint that PlayStation is trying to double down on their streaming service?\u201d\n00:53:00 - The Nano Biologist - \u201cHappy Friday and Welcome back! I hope yall had fun during Judges week (please blink twice if you saw a new Fable game). Do the general gaming audience have a misconception when it comes to the Microsoft/Sony Azure server partnership? On twitter, facebook, and reddit people are calling this the end of Xbox/Sony, ones buying out the other, or we will soon see one console's games on the other (similar to when Xbox Live support was coming to the switch). But can this just be a simple partnership? People seem to forget that Xbox uses Sony's Blu Ray drives, AND that Microsoft making deals doesn't always mean Xbox is making those deals and same for PlayStation and Sony. What do you think will come out of this partnership? Will it just be a simple, pay us and we'll host your game streaming service?\u201d\n00:56:22 - Squad Up: Go to Reddit, play Division\n00:58:40 - You\u2018re Wrong\nTomorrow\u2019s host:\nEARLY SHOW - MONDAY: Greg and Tim\nTUESDAY: Fran and Andrea\nWEDNESDAY: Andrea and Whitta\nTHURSDAY: Fran and Andrea\nFRIDAY: Fran and Snowbike Mike\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunnygames?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunnygames\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller and Tim Gettys talk about the biggest stories in Video Games.\n\nBackground Wall Art by Orioto - https://www.facebook.com/OriotoPosters/",
