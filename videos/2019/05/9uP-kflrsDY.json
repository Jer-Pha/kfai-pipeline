    "title": "How to Make Pasta Carbonara (with Josh Macuga) - Cooking with Greggy",
    "description": "At Extra Life, Josh told us about the time he made his carbonara for Chrissy Teigen so of course we forced him to make it for us too! \n\nINGREDIENTS\n-1 lb pasta (I suggest farfalle but I've used penne, rigatoni, linguini, spaghetti, and rotini and they work as well!)\n-1 lb bacon (use whatever's on sale, pancetta is too expensive and too fatty)\n-4 to 6 cloves of garlic\n-1/4 cup of chopped flat leaf parsley\n-4 eggs\n-1 cup parmesan cheese (shredded or shaved, not ground)\n-Salt and pepper\n-Dry white wine\n\nDIRECTIONS\n-Put a pot of salted water on the stove and bring to a boil\n-While the water is heating up, cook bacon til about 3/4 of the way done and drain half the bacon grease. Turn off heat and leave in pan.\n-In a separate pan, brown the garlic\n-Chop parsley \n-Crack the eggs and whisk them in a large mixing bowl \n-Add parmesan, parsley, salt, and pepper to the whisked eggs and stire to combine\n-Add pasta to boiling water \n-When pasta is halfway done, turn the bacon on HIGH heat, and add the garlic. Finish cooking and add a splash of wine and cook off a bit of the wine but don't drain any of the liquid. \n-Pour the cooked pasta and the bacon mixture into the bowl of prepped egg and cheese mixture. Mix VIGOROUSLY with a serving/wooden spoon until pasta is coated. \n-Serve and enjoy!\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunny\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller, Tim Gettys, and Nick Scarpino talk about the biggest stories in nerd culture.\n\nMusic by Tonedeff - http://www.QN5.com",
