    "description": "I love going to Joe Beef in Montreal and this is one of my favorite recipes from their cookbook!\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n-Salt\n-1 bunch kale, stems removed and roughly chopped\n-4 slices bacon, cut into lardons\n-1 small onion, chopped\n-1 clove garlic, chopped\n-1/4 cup (60 mL) dry white wine\n-Pepper\n-1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n-Small squeeze of fresh lemon juice\n-1 egg (optional)\n\nDIRECTIONS\n1) Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. \n\n2) Add kale and cook for 10 minutes, or until soft. Drain well and squeeze lightly. \n\n3) Transfer to a cutting board and chop finely. Set aside.\n\n4) In a frying pan, fry bacon over medium-high heat for about 6 minutes, or until crisp. \n\n5) Add the onion and cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until translucent. Lower the fire to medium-low, add the garlic, and sweat for 1 minute. \n\n6) Add the kale, wine, and a pinch each of salt and pepper and cook for 3 to 4 minutes to blend the flavours. If the mixture looks really shiny, scoop out a little of the fat and add a bit of water, and then add the butter. Mix in the lemon juice.\n\n7) Move the bacon and kale mixture to a plate and fry an egg in the same pan. Serve the egg of top of the bacon and kale. Go back to bed.\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunny\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller, Tim Gettys, and Nick Scarpino talk about the biggest stories in nerd culture.\n\nMusic by Tonedeff - http://www.QN5.com",
