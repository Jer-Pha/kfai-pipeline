Each and every week we get together to rank, review, and recap different movie franchises. Oh no, Ludicris says in the Twitch chat, \"I mistakenly watched The Predator.\" Oh well. How could you get them mixed up? How could you possibly? They They have such an easy naming convention. Yes. It really makes a lot of sense if you study it in college. Oh man.

To be fair, they shot like half of it in Austin, Texas, and got a lot of tax breaks for it, but the other half was like Hawaii and you're just shooting out in the jungle. It's not like you got to pay a ton for that. True, but I mean, the cast is like even even for the time still kind of stacked. Uh box compared to Alien versus Predator 2, you know, come on now.

But the fact that it's like very much like that Terminator Genesis, right, where they went and we're a sequel to T2 or whatever. It's like, oh, like the callbacks, them referencing Guatemala. It's a goofy idea of, you know, pick picking all these predators to go get hunted by the Predator. But guess what? The Predator is a weird [\u00a0__\u00a0] stupid idea.

The other predator the other Predator is acting like a [\u00a0__\u00a0] He's our predator.\" And then he gets clowned out. I'm like, \"Oh, we we're getting clowned out by the loser Predator. Whatever. This is still cool.\" I had a really really fun time with this movie last night. Didn't Brown out once. Stayed awake the entire time. [\u00a0__\u00a0] you. Yeah.

Like, I don't really want to make any reference to the second one.\" So, all of the references in this, like a lot of the like the tech and stuff like that is building off of Predator. Great stuff. Nick, talk a little bit more about the Robert Rodriguez of it all. Yeah. So, weird enough direct. Yeah. No, he didn't direct it, but it's it's made by Robert Rodriguez's Troublemaker Studios, which you guys know you see that that very very loud graphic in the middle. And apparently when he was directing um Desperado for Fox, they tapped him and they said, \"Hey, do you would you want to do a treatment for like a script for a Predator sequel?\" And he was like, \"Absolutely, why the hell not?\" And it just got kind of lost in time until",

We want to greenlight this because we don't love the direction that Alien versus Predator is going in. We'd like to get this a little bit more back to the roots.\" And because you wrote this like in the '9s, I guess it it's very much rooted in that nostalgia of of the first Predator. And you see all those touchstones here. And the homages are there. Some of them are a little bit more overt than others, but I think he does a really really good job of of paying like paying respect to the original Predator and then iterating on it and having a lot of fun with it.

So, I don't remember seeing this in theaters, but I do remember watching it either on DVD or or rental or HBO one night and being like, \"Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] this movie is [\u00a0__\u00a0] good.\" It just opens up and you're like, \"Whoa, what are we doing? This is weird.\" And it's very well paced. It manages to do what I think um contrary to some criticisms of it, I really do think they managed to sort of capture the tension and the quiet moments and the sort of escalation that the first Predator gave us, but it's it's more creative. And I I love talking about this movie with my wife cuz it's actually her favorite Predator movie, but she will never say that because she's like, I want to pay so much",

We're making it. It builds off of The Predator and the escalation of craziness that happens in this is just really fun to watch. So I I will always tout this as being a hidden gem in the series and I was very excited when we got to this to hear all your perspectives on it. Andy, this movie is really cool. Really enjoyed it. I think it's so close to being almost like amazing in a lot of ways.

Got to set some things straight for the audience. I thought I had seen AP in theaters and then after watching it for a review, I was like, it wasn't this one. It was the Adrien Brody one.

Yeah, I watched the pianist and I really enjoyed it. Let's talk about the cast of this though. It's awesome. There are two Academy Award winners. I think Mahersel Ali won for I think he won two, right? He won one for Moonlight and Green Book, I want to say. I might I might be crazy. I think he only won for Moonlight. He was nominated twice.

Something must be wrong with me cuz I similarly I I mean these movies have beaten me down the last couple weeks.\" You know, there's there's like this like the classic obviously some of the first blockbusters of our time and even Alien One, like whatever you want to call that, more of like a sci-fi like art piece of a thing.

Uh I'm with Andy that I I feel like it's so close to being legitimately amazing, but there's a couple things they do that I was like, I don't like this. Toe for Grace. Love him.

It it ended up not materializing cuz they were like we don't need him for this and it was a smart choice not to because um talking about the casting and talking about the Royce character specifically, I think the Adrian Brody character after you watch like that was an inspired choice. A, he's a great actor. B, he's not Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's not Hulking. He is a very skinny, although he put on 20 pounds of muscle, still jacked. But he's not that character. And and and he's not he doesn't embody that character either in spirit because the Arnold Schwarzenegger character was like an American military hero. Even though he was a mercenary, he was a hero.
