The heretic heretic prophet I always mix whatever heretic prophet hereditary. Yeah, hereditary. I was I always want to say heretic project. Yeah, I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know. I always say intergalactic cuz the kid cuddy. It's messed me up every single time. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like it. Uh intergalactic the heretic prophet.

That means like The Witcher 4 Intergalactic will be released in 2027 at the earliest.

If Intergalactic heads straight to PS6, Naughty Dog faces the pro prospect of having skipped the PS5 generation in terms of brand new games. That is a crazy thought to think about. Uh that's me saying that, not not the reporter. Uh, so far the studio has released ports, rebasters, and remakes on Sony's current gen console, including The Last of Us Part Two, Uncharted Legacy of Thieves Collection, The Last of Us Part One, and The Last of Us Part Two Remastered. Assuming Intergalactic releases in 2027, and taking into account Duckman's comments about it being in development for 4 years so far, by the time the game comes out, it will have been in the works for 6 years. Yeah, that makes sense. It's like, no, none of the none of this surprised me. Does it surprise you at all? Um,",

I think I was a little bit hoping for 2026, but I think when they first announced it, immediately I'm like, \"Oh, we're going to it's going to be quite a few years before we see that thing.\" I think that's just the base assumption you had to make when you whenever we're being whenever a game of this nature is being revealed. Like, I would think the same thing if it was like a Sony Santa Monica game or any of like those top tier like, \"Oh man, I've been waiting a while for this studio to to reveal their game.\" Yeah. I always always bump up a few years from the announcement of when we're actually going to get that. So 2027 doesn't sound crazy to me.

I think no matter what though, if I think once this game comes out, I would imagine that it's coming out on PS5 either way. Oh yeah. Unless we get into like heavy delay territory. Yeah. Yeah, unless we get to like Last Guardian territory, but even then, I mean, we forget that Ragnarok came out on PS5, PS4, like we're going to we're going to get it on both. I I think this is going to be a last of a Last of Us 2 situation, right? Where it just comes out on the I guess last generation hardware by that time, right?

So, like I'm I'm I'm fine with Naughty Dog taking as much time as possible.

And I kind of go back and forth on it because I think there are some studios that, you know, can be the prestige. We're going to put out one game a generation and it's going to be the game that is the critical darling, the game that is the flagship. This is the game of our generation kind of thing versus an insomniac or a team of Soie. Not to say that in Spider-Man isn't going to be one of the games in generation, right?

Like Insomniac has a level of um refinement that they have within their studio of we know how to put out games. We know how to make things quick and they don't need to be 11 out of 10 games. You know what I mean? They don't need to be these 10 10 out of 10. But I mean they're extremely impressive. Yeah, they're extremely impressive.

You got to scale those things up in order to get to a point where you are insomniac and you're making all these you have all these different teams working on all this different stuff. Uh so yeah, that I think that's the dream. I don't think anything's going to get smaller. And I I look to if I wanted the the perfect world for a smaller type experience where you can continuously have that AAA but then also have those smaller experiences is what Ninja Giden's doing right now which is kind of perfect right they have the Ninja Giden 2 uh Black remake that came out this year they have Ragebound which is a different studio that is making like a 2D smaller thing and then they have Ninja Gaiden 4 right like that that to",

Maybe Uncharted. That's the thing is I think when you're when you give the Ninja Giden example, I think it's fascinating because you have um something that is going to be a third person action game, but then you have like a 2D thing, right? That is a different genre that has a different pipeline, all that stuff. I mean, if you wanted to go that route, right, it would be all right, we're going to make a last 2D survival thing. Yeah.

It just it could. Yeah. But they want it to be they want I think the thing with PlayStation that PlayStation wants all of their big IP like that to be synonymous with the AAA of it all, right? Like they don't want the smaller experience. That's why I'm interested in this God of War thing where it's like is that a smaller experience in terms of like scope and scale but it still has the same graphical fidelity and it's just like it is like a Miles Morales type deal or is it like a fully like hey no this is a different type of video game and we're trying something different.

I and I still think I think God of War is one of those franchises that would fit if you wanted to do a 2D thing. If you wanted to do like a different genre thing, right? I think when I'm looking at Naughty Dog, when I say scale back, right, I'm talking about the fact that Last of Us 2 was a 25 26-hour game. I'm like, what if it was what if your next big game was 13 hours? Like, that's what I'm talking about as far as getting your games out the door a little bit quicker. But then that's the thing is that you kind of dig yourself in that hole a little bit, right? Where it's like people are expecting that longer experiences for $70, right? If as PlayStation you keep developing to people's expectations currently like you're not going to be able to keep up with it. You've done you've I agree with",

And now like if you're not continuing to do that, yeah, people are going to get upset. But guess what? I think people get over it cuz nobody I don't think anybody's going to be able to to sustain that if your name is not Rockstar. and Rockstar is putting out a game every eight years or something like that. And so, yeah, that's true. Yeah, I know. You got I think you kind of just have to figure out how to scale or I guess scale to scale to what you want it to be. Like Naughty Dog, I don't think Naughty Dog has to be the guys that put out a game every 3 or four years as long as the one game you're putting out every six years is [\u00a0__\u00a0] a 10 out of 10, sells 30",

Like as long as you're doing that and then you have the other studios to help prop you up and you have that synergistic all right we got Naughty Dog for the prestige we got Insomniac to help us make money or whatever right like team of Soie to help you know sustain the library and all that stuff. I think you could have a relationship there between studios that works but it does put Naughty Dog in a very lofty place especially if one of those fails potentially. Exactly. If you miss Oh man that's a problem. That's a big one.
