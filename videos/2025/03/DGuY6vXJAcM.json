A film adaptation of Split Fiction, the hot new co-op game from It Takes Two developer Hazesite Studios, is in the works. Variety has learned. Sources at GDC in San Francisco have confirmed that the media company Story Kitchen, led by the same team that shephered uh the It Takes Two uh game into a film project, now set up at Amazon, is putting together the film's cast, writers, and director, into a package uh as offers for the rights keep coming in from multiple top Hollywood studios. Wow. Variety, which is on the ground at GDC this week, is continuing to monitor the bidding war uh with more details on the project to come. There's another one that we talk about as far as video game adaptations. Video games even turn into TV shows, movies.

I think no matter what, this was going to get adapted because Hazite, they're the that is that studio right now. Yeah, they are in the in the spotlight. They're it. Um, yeah, this doesn't surprise me. Um, look, when you when you are what's been so amazing, there's a lot of the Hazite team walking around GDC at the moment, which is cool to see the uh the Hazite hoodies and the split fiction hoodies. So, shout out to them. They're really kind of doing a bit of a victory lap right now, and rightly so.

And Split Fiction with the reviews clearly, you know, it's it's crazy and I really hope that people continue to recognize it and and they are. this is not necessarily this is this is game is popular let's turn it into something else and absolutely Hazel get your bag um this I mean is this being turned into a I I read this sorry to be really cynical and it's like a Hollywood package we're",

Yeah. I think it's it's funny cuz the Yeah, the IP as far as release has existed for like two weeks. You know, it's not had time to like build a ground swell. We don't know what in what two years when this movie comes out. Are people still caring about split fiction like that? Are we talking about the Split Fiction 2 being developed, right?

The thing I will say in a little bit of opposition is Split Fiction I think is a wonderful video game, but my main complaint with it is that I don't think the story does a great job of being about what it's about. I don't Have you played Split Fiction yet? I I'm I literally when I get back to the UK, I will I will play it because I need a person to play it with. The the premise of split fiction is that you have two writers, two story writers that essentially their minds get merged and you are going back and forth between their different stories. The problem I have with it is uh a lot of the time moment to moment in this game is that the stories that we're hopping into aren't good stories. They're good gameplay segments. And so you hop into a fantasy gameplay segment and it and it's oh I'm riding a dragon. And then you hop into a sci-fi gameplay segment and",

And it feels like there I hate to use the ludo narrative dissonance sort of thing, right? But there's a a little narrative dissonance of okay, these stories that we're hopping into are way more fun to play as video games than they are interesting as these storytellers that are diving into these things. I think if you're making a movie, you could remedy that. You could actually make these storytelling segments about actual interesting fantasy stories and actual interesting sci-fi stories and make it more about the writing and how that loops back into what these characters are going through cuz that that's the one thing where I'm like I don't know if you nailed this in split",

And um they are very very clever because they have gone, how can we have a two-player game that you can have one person buy it and then you can both play it and and it does it so well. Clearly the gameplay, everyone talks about how highly it is, how how they speak so highly of it and they um basically say how good it is and that it feels like the the perfection of a formula they've been working on again and again because they work in video games.
