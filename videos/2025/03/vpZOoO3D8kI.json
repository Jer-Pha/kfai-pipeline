Nintendo has announced it's expanding its partnership with baseball team the Seattle Mariners. Just ahead of opening day 2025, Nintendo has confirmed that every Mariners jersey will have the Nintendo logo on on it this season. The expanded collaboration can be seen in a new promo video released today where Seattle Mariners I thought it was just a screenshot of the hat. I was like good job Kev good B-roll pull where Seattle Mariners centerfielder Julio Rodriguez shows off the bright red logo on the jersey sleeve. Per Nintendo's announcement the console and game maker will be will be on jersey sleeves this season starting with opening day 2025 on March 27th when the Mariners host the athletics.

Not even in a bad way, but like when Fallout becomes a successful Amazon TV show, I more so view it from the okay, Bethesda and Todd Howard licensed out the the Fallout franchise for Amazon to do and like they did a good job with it in the same way that like I don't connect that to Halo, which and I don't connect that to Minecraft either. I know it's all technically owned by Microsoft, but they feel like separate enough. It's not like a PlayStation Productions type situation, right? or even a Nintendo situation where it feels like there's a bit more of an intentionality with how they're approaching their movie stuff. Not that like",

Not that like well PlayStation went and made PlayStation Studios, right? Productions productions. Thank you so much. Uh you know, for the Mario movie, right? Like Miiamoto was so involved on that. He was like the mouthpiece of it, let alone how much he did for it. And then you see that in the fruits of the labor, right? where we that movie is a not even a love letter to Mario, which it is, but it's more of just like a museum of Easter eggs and references and sound bites and all these different things. Like, yeah, there's having the creators involved means so much. And so for Minecraft, you're like, \"All right, like Minecraft, like it's a look, right?\" Yeah. Because I mean, there's things you have to have in there of, you know, Jack Black eating a pork chop or whatever and making a pickaxe. Like, I get",

Like, I get it, but it's not like we're trying to there's some sacred story we're trying to protect with Minecraft. Yeah. And I'm not even saying like even one route is better than the other, right? Because like obviously PlayStation Productions like not it's not like they're just putting out masterpiece after masterpiece. You know, they had the Uncharted movie and the Gran Turismo movie. Both okay. Um and they have Last of Us which is [\u00a0__\u00a0] fantastic, right? In the same way that on the Xbox side, Fallout, the Amazon show is probably my favorite video game adaptation yet as far as how TV goes, right? But I don't look at that and go, \"Oh man, are they going to learn from this and make a better Halo?\" But it's like I don't it doesn't feel as you know together in that way as like when I look at Nintendo or",

But as long as as long as whatever comes out is good then I don't really care. Of course like if you're going to make a Gears movie or if you're going to make a Wolfenstein movie or whatever whatever it is hey as long as you give it to the right people and they do and they do right by it and yeah like have the creators involved probably or people that know what they're doing. Yeah. I'm excited for whatever it is. For sure.",
