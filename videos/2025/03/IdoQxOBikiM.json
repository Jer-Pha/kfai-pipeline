Um, you know, we talked about this for the last year, the four horsemen, the the games that are announced and the games that come out, which feel like they're signaling the end of the Switch and feel like they're a result of how late we are in in this into this generation, right? And like that feeling of, oh, Nintendo's holding the big guns for the next thing and so don't expect anything big. And like this direct very much felt like that. I think when when you get a direct surprise announce for the week before the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, you know what you're what you're getting into. You know what's going to be part for the course. And so like we go through this and I look down at the announcements and I'm like, \"Okay, yes, this makes sense.\" Even though there are surprises here that are delightful. I think Paton being announced for Switch is delightful just cuz it's such an unexpected thing. And I",

I think Paton being announced for Switch is delightful just cuz it's such an unexpected thing. And I think what that signals for the future of uh PlayStation, especially when we loop lump in everybody's golf into there, there's a conversation to be had as far as oh wait, if everybody's golf in Patapon can come to Switch just out of nowhere developed by Bay Night AMCO for some reason, like what else can that mean? I think there's a conversation that we'll have later about that. Uh but then you get other neat games. Witchbrook is a big one. Uh that's a game that I know a lot of Stardw Valley fans have been looking forward to. I think you asked Joey about that. Joy's going to like, you know, go crazy over how like, you know, Witchbrook is one of those games that has felt like it's been in development forever.

Actually, that makes sense that that is the one that's been in development since 2017.\" That's been in development for a long time. I think they said they were waiting for it since 2017. So, I don't know if that's just like since Stardw Valley or if it really has been since uh that long since they announced it. That's cool. Um, but then you have other bizarre things.

There was no Switch online stuff here, which makes me think, oh, we're are we going to get more Switch Online stuff at the Switch 2 presentation. And what form does that take? We saved that for the meal, not the appetizer. I mean, Donkey Kong 64. Yeah, baby. Fair enough. They're shutting it all down for uh Switch Online 2. They're getting rid of everything else. Um, what do you think of this? I thought it was I thought it was okay. We We got what we expected.

I thought Witch Book Witchbrook looked neat. Uh, [\u00a0__\u00a0] Secret Life of Walter Schmidy or whatever. Uh, Eternal Life Goldman. Eternal life of Golden. That's the one. Um, cool look at Metroid. Hadn't seen Metroid in a while. Right. This is the second time we've seen actual Metroid gameplay. Really, really neat seeing uh what they're cooking out over there. And then of course that awesome scene at the end with the new suit. Very cool looking.

Yeah, I mean I'm kind of kind of where you guys are. I think maybe at the end of the day maybe a little higher just because I appreciate I appreciate that uh Nintendo Directs in the last couple maybe like year or two have made space for uh collections of old games like the the Gradius thing and stuff like that. Like recently we got the Marvel vs. Capcom collection, the fighting collection. Like they just keep putting out these collections that I think are are good and like I'm such a fan of those old things so it's nice to see them back. the amount of HD remasters of classic JRPGs like we're somehow not done with that yet.

Like Eternal Life of Goldman, like first time I've seen that. Really hyped for that now. Uh Everybody's Golfing Patapon. That's kind of big deal stuff just in terms of the inside baseball like what's that mean? And like it gets me so excited for um the some PlayStation IP that I would have never would have thought would ever come back in any way. But now it's like all right cool. Well if you open up to that level of an install base for weird games and Nintendo Patapon could be a Nintendo game. You know what I mean? Um so I think that that's cool.

Uh Pokemon ZA, the the Royal Tournament, I'm like, that's kind of what I want from uh a game like that. I think the nighttime stuff looks way better than the daytime stuff. Not like it's uh a pretty game by any means, but it's like I think it looks better. Um yeah, it looks fun, which is great.

They didn't present it well. Yeah, they didn't present it well. The the messages had really not executed well.

Maybe they're trying to recreate that for the Switch 2 and use this as a really big marketing push of hey, there's news to look forward to every single day after the Switch 2 direct about the Switch 2. I mean, then they literally said like, hey, we're going to like put out information about Switch 2 after that, which I do think is exciting. The idea of Pikmin 4 comics, there's a lot of potential here. We'll just see how far they take it. 6 months ago or whatever they put out the Nintendo music app and I think that that also has a lot of potential.

Even just looking at Nintendo's like social media presence, like they're very bizarre and just like Nintendo, there's no rules, but like the amount of times they've promoted Donkey Kong Country Returns HD in the last like four months. They promoted this game more than they promoted any game ever. And it's like kind of weird. It almost feels like a very tonedeaf type of thing.
