In fact, I hope I'm a big fan of Xenolade Chronicles X because that's what story number one is. Xenolade Chronicles X appears to have hidden a 60fps mode uh or appears to have hidden a 60 fps mode sparking Nintendo Switch 2 speculation. This is Eric Van Allen at IGN. Xenolade Chronicles X Definitive Edition is out today for Nintendo Switch consoles and some players are already digging it into its data to learn more about it. One discovery seems to reveal a hidden mode enabling 60 frames per second which has certainly caused for curiosity and speculation about what it could mean for the Switch 2.

Over on X Twitter via WCCF Tech, modder Masa Masa Grado R uh dug into the ex executable of Xenolade Chronicles X Definitive Edition and found what they called a hidden 60fps mode. The modder said it seems to be implemented only partially since enabling it causes weird issues. While it's not implemented in the game proper, the existence of the setting does spark some interesting questions. If it's not available, why is it in there? So, what an interesting question. While some stray leftover code could be one answer, some speculation about what this could mean for the Switch 2 and existing Switch games is also easy to understand. Nintendo has confirmed that the Switch 2 will most will be mostly backwards compatible. The official reveal of its next console said that the console will play Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games as well as Nintendo Switch games with an asterisk that certain Switch games may not be",

It's hard to imagine Xenolade Chronicles X would be one of those asterisk games, but there's a question over whether existing Switch games would get enhanced on the nextG console. There's no proof of that yet, but speculation over the usual trends of backwards compatibility. It certainly makes the Switch 2 all the more interesting for existing Switch owners, though. We'll hopefully learn more in a few weeks when Nintendo airs its Switch 2 Direct on April 2nd, 2025. There we'll learn more about the upcoming console and Nintendo's plans for it.

It's a very charming art style, but there's a frame rate there that just doesn't hit for me. Just Yeah. It just doesn't gel, right? And so the idea that uh the Switch 2 could fix that. I was complaining to Tim about it. He's like, \"Well, hold on.\" You know, I mean, don't do this. And of course, I still want to go back theoretically I'm still I have a hunger right now.

Hope it hopefully it looks great there, right? Um, so that's the idea here is that there are a lot of Nintendo games that I didn't tinker enough with on Switch and so that I have. And so if it was the idea that, hey, switch 2's here and it's making them look better, it's making them run better, it's shortening these load times, I think of Animal Crossing, be like, oh yeah, I'd love to tinker more with this. Is there like a like um hierarchy of requests that you have as far as that, right? Is it FPS? Is it just load times? Is it wanting better resolution?

It's just more to the fact that like when you reviewed Pokemon Scarlet and we, you know, you see the video the video of the legs kicking and looking just awful. Like I just don't want these games to look like trash. Nintendo has such a great art style and I'm very broad here. A great art style for most of their beloved games and franchises, right? That those should look and run excellent, right? And I think it's, you know, Imran Khan, the dawn, uh I think the number one Nintendo takedown artist out there. Not in a bad way, but of the way of like they put I think it it might have been Zah. They put up screenshots and it was barren or whatever and he's like, \"Look at Xenolade Chronicles.

What I hate about this the same video this just just where we can see the pause. Perfect. What I hate about this is how uninspired and yes, it catches your eye, but I think it's ugly. Like I I would have been like, \"Hey, we we're doing this sponsorship. We want the Nintendo logo on the jersey.\" Of course, you're Seattle. We love Nintendo. And they sent this, I'd be like, \"Cool. Can we take out all can I go in there and take out all of the red, make it the Nintendo pill and blow that up?\" Like, I think if you did that and they give it a red a border",

Again, I don't it's the usual conversation of how much uh how much influence and power in this uh dynamic and this relationship does Phil and the team at Xbox have, right? That's the issue, right?
