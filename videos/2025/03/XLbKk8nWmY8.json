Um so we'll probably save these for getting something kind of special. So back to the uh Avengers thing. Yes. They're panning it, right? Yeah. Did you notice some people's names missing that you would expect? Did you like I I think you know what I saw on the Reddit was, you know, X-Men versus the Avengers type vibe. Is that what we're getting? I don't see I don't know because again I think we're in I think this is supposed to be like the tail end this and like um this is supposed to be like the tail end of the multiverse stuff.
