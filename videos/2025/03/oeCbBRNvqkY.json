Uh, we haven't heard much about Ghost of Yotay in recent months, but after fans spotted a morsel of new story information published to the game's website, they're having fun speculating about how Sucker Punch's hotly anticipated PlayStation 5 exclusive will actually play. The official website includes the following story snippet. 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, a new warrior, Atsu arises from the ashes of her homestead. Filled with fury and determination, Atsu will hunt down those responsible for the death of her family and exact her revenge. Every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the ghost will be up to you.\" End quote. We already knew Ghost of Yotay is setting uh is and the time period and that Atsu will be on a revenge mission of some kind. But what we didn't",

We already knew Ghost of Yotay is setting uh is and the time period and that Atsu will be on a revenge mission of some kind. But what we didn't know was that she's hunting down those responsible for the death of her family after her homestead is destroyed. Fans speculating that Ghost of Yote will have bounty hunting mechanic in which Atsu takes on jobs to earn money needed for other things in the game. There's the potential here then for an actual in-game economy where Sushima didn't really have any sort of money mechanic. If true, this taps into Sucker Punch's stated goal of giving players more control over Atsu's story. Creative director Jason Connell has said that one of the changes compared to Ghost of Sushima will be a less repetitive open world. Quote, \"One challenge that comes with making an open world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again. We wanted to balance against uh that and find unique",

And enhanced performance and visuals on the PlayStation 5 Pro. And here's the crucial part. The website lists 2025 as the release window for Ghost of Yote. There's been much talk about Sony may be waiting for Rockstar to announce GTA 6's release date so it can make sure Ghost of Yote doesn't clash.

But if it comes out alongside whatever Nintendo and whatever like Ghost of Yote and whatever like these big companies have going on, they're not going to release it alongside GTA 6. This is an interesting even keeping Borderlands in the conversation. For me, I'm saying right away like for me to get hype about Borderlands 4, I'm going to need a Vault Hunter I really like.

But until I'm really seeing what that game is and what my moment to moment gameplay is going to be, it's like, okay, well, I've done GTA a lot. I think right now in the marketing cycle for both these games, Ghost of Yote, I think, just feels more tangible and feasible. And we're getting bits about it, right, that I think is important. Again, like, yeah, them talking about this being more of a revenge tale. I'm always down for a revenge tale. them talking about how they, you know, they want to tackle that repetition and figure out how to not make it as repetitive as open worlds tend to be.

And I think both those games are great examples. I think Ghost of Sushima already, even with within its repetition, was already still fun. I liked the things that I was doing. So, if it is the thing of all right, we're taking what worked with Ghost of Sushima and just building in more excitement from the moment to moment. Finding the next I was going to say tower.

Are you trying to make another Lord Lord of the Rings out of this, right? And like is this going to feel generic fantasy? Is this going to feel iterative of just oh it's a three movie train um you know fantasy trilogy? Weird dungeon bosses. It'll feel Zelda if you but like for me that's not enough for me.
