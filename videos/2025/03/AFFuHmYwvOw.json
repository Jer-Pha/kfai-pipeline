So, Greg, can you just talk for a second? Don't get choked up. I know it's hard to say farewell to your three stars, Tim, but I will be taking them on Wednesday. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, in NBS. You're one week removed from the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal where more importantly I will cash in stars in the bank and take Tim's three stars. Nick, we turn to you for expert analysis. Tim, already a very small man. What will happen when I steal his one reason for living? I mean, this is it for him, right? This is Tim finally going to Love Island and just burying his head in the sand like an eboo. And you have to really wonder, Gia is watching this all unfold. She's looking at them just L after L after L and then this one comes through. I mean, what is she going to She going to look at all those [\u00a0__\u00a0] sneakers and",

That's true. Anyways, let's talk about Daredevil. We're talking about Daredevil. But first, we need to talk about something bigger. Avengers Doomsday. As we are recording this right now, we are uh approximately 5 6 hours in. I can't get the the time to pop up here, but 5 hours according what Kevin's got. Okay, 5 hours in to a huge Marvel Studios announcement. They have a live stream going on their uh Twitter um that has just been slowly every 12 minutes revealing a different like director's chair with an actor's name on it.

I wouldn't say so far we've had anybody that is truly unexpected, but it is definitely starting to paint the picture of, oh, they're doing well. They pop for Alien Comas out there. They did not see the one and only fabulous Nightcrawler, host of the traders. We're what we're going to do before we get to the Daredevil stuff is we're going to go uh chair by chair, chair by chair, everybody that's been announced so far, cuz it does seem like this stream is going to be going for a couple more hours uh announcing a bunch of different characters.

Tomorrow's about to be pretty insane because, uh, Nintendo announced the last minute Nintendo Direct before their Switch 2 Direct next week. So, and don't forget during that Switch 2 Direct, that's when I'll be stealing the stars in the bank. You can forget that if you want. Um, so tomorrow, uh, we will be reacting to the Nintendo Direct at 10:00 a.m. Pacific. That's our normal start time for Games Daily. The Direct is going to be a couple hours earlier. We're just not going to watch it. So, y'all can watch it whenever you want, but watch it with us for our first time. We're going to stay off social media. We're not going to know what's going on.

I was still like, okay, I love this enough as an overall product that I'm so all in. Nikki, I'm with Craig as well. I think the the the bottle episode, the standalone episode of the bank, I thought was fun, but I I do start to worry that now we're going to creep into uh season 1, season 2, season 3 of Daredevil, where there was always those one or two episodes where you're like, we didn't need that. And it's it's sort of taking me away from this just long enough for me to stop like to cool on the overall plot. I think by the time we hit episode 6 and he walks up with an axe, I'm kind of back in. Um but but overall I I'm with Greg on this. I think these two were the first not let downs but not as good as obviously coming off the last one um with the writing and all that stuff.

But I do think that I think if this were a different different vibe and they were able to do like maybe just seven episodes for this, maybe not in 10 or whatever, how much they're doing, I think this would have been a scene where he stopped this bank robbery and then we moved on because I don't think ultimately this helped the larger plot and I'm really more invested in that.

Nick, you wanted to get into it? Yeah, just getting into um the the kind of bigger criticism I have of this the the sixth episode was that I didn't feel like the transition to Daredevil was as dramatic as I thought it was going to be. It felt very nonchalant. And granted, look, we know he wants to be Daredevil again. He's noodling with the law. He left the bed and he went up there and started practicing. He's doing his cool stuff. And obviously, look, the [\u00a0__\u00a0] series isn't called Matt Murdoch attorney of Law. It's called Daredevil Born Again. So, we got to see him there.

I think he's more troubled. I think in this one there really wasn't it felt forced that the girl was like, \"Hey, I'm following this dude. Like, I figured out where this guy is in the subway and and then Matt just kind of finds him or maybe I missed the detail there of how he knew where she was.\" I guess maybe she told him where she was going or whatever. Um, but I just felt like it was a little hamfisted to get him back in the suit.

I'm like, there's been a few leaps in logic here that are very much a comic book thing. When I'm reading a comic, I don't worry about it, think about it. But in time here, right, one of the ones I jotted down is like Matt leaves the bank. He has left the bank. I'm on the phone with Kristen. Things didn't go well. And he goes, \"Call 911.\" And he the 911 call. Yeah, my partner just left the bank and said, \"Call 911.\" Something's And it's the same thing later on where it's like uh I have the one of like it felt too forced of when Cherry shows up and he's got his heart beating and Matt it's like is that for me?

Like I just think that it's a it's a wise take on the timeline of where we've had the characters and stuff and also making these shows matter because Kingpin was in Hawkeye. Of course, he was. I just think stylistically this show in my opinion is a cut above all the shows that had come prior to it. And I think that they do a really great job even in these episodes of just these candid shots they have of New York, the St. Patrick's Day, right? Which I doubt that Netflix got out there or excuse me, um Disney Plus got out there and recreated St. Patrick's Day.
