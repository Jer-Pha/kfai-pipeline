It's Friday and it's Mike and Nick in the afternoon and we're [\u00a0__\u00a0] back. We're back. Uh, we're back. We had a great uh we had a great stream yesterday where we talked to you guys and thank you so much for everyone that called in. That was fun. I think we might do that a little bit more on the grindy grindy days. Um but today Mike surprised me. Mike said, \"Nick, look, I'm on the stream. We're probably only going to have an hour and a half to play and he and he decided on his own accord to come in a little early today, a little bit of a looser schedule and just sit here and grind for me off stream.\" And you did a really good job, Mike. Grinded. Grinded by the light as they are. up in a douche in the middle of the night. Kevin, let's take a look at where we find our squad right now.

We won't reveal that present right now, but there is a present in the box as well. So Nick, you are kind of back on track. We've been grinding. We've recovered after a couple of jabs left and right. And uh we've brought ourselves back to kind of where we need to be. Are you going to reveal the present right now? Well, I saw we got one earlier that I saw. You want to see the present? Okay. So, I want to give a shout out, but we do. You want to do it? You want to do it? I mean, you can do it right now if you want. I got to look, man.

Of course, today I have been grinding for Nick and I've been doing my best not to catch a bunch of Pok\u00e9mon, but I did unfortunately catch one Pokemon. We had a very special guest in the room with me. So, I do apologize to all of you out there. I didn't go on and name it after one of you cuz I did want to save that for us. But I did allow our guest to name a Pokemon because they were standing next to me. So, if you take a look, we have a mill tank that is now level 25. Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] Uh, we caught it at about 13, so I was really grinding the whole crew there. Uh, to all of you out there. Again, I apologize.

I had a couple opportunities where I could have taken that out, but I was like, you know what? I'll hold on to that. That'll be one we could lose later on, but I thought it would just be fun to hold on to. What was Dudikoff at? And then body slam right there. Seven. 28. 28. And then uh milk drink. You heal yourself. You a little milk in you. Ah, I had a little milk time. What is Wet Kev at? Uh, 29. And so, of course, that puts Nick kind of back in it. Kind of funny. Best friends.
