Um, you know, we talked about this for the last year, the Four Horsemen, the the games that are announced and the games that come out, which feel like they're signaling the end of the Switch and feel like they're a result of how late we are in in this into this generation, right? And like that feeling of, oh, Nintendo's holding the big guns for the next thing and so don't expect anything big. And like this direct very very much felt like that. I think when when you get a direct surprise announced for the week before the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, you know what you're we know what what you're getting into. You know what's going to be power for the course. And so like we go through this and I look down at the announcements and I'm like, \"Okay, yes, this makes sense.\" Even",

I think Patapon being announced for Switch is delightful just cuz it's such an unexpected thing. And I think what that signals for the future of uh PlayStation, especially when we loop lump in everybody's golf into there, there's a conversation to be had as far as oh wait, if everybody's golf in Patapon can come to Switch just out of nowhere, developed by Bayite AMCO for some reason, like what else can that mean? I think there's a conversation that we'll have later about that. Uh but then you get other neat games. Witchbrook is a big one.

I'm not going to spoil it for you, but I've been waiting for this game since 2017.\" And I thought I was like, \"Oh, did they announce Hollow Night Silk Song?\" And then and then, you know, seeing Witchbrook, I was like, \"That makes sense. Actually, that makes sense that that is the one that's been in development since 2017.\" That's been in development for a long time. I think they said they were waiting for it since 2017.

Cuz yeah, there was no there was no Zelda but also I'm wearing my Donkey Kong shirt, my DK64 shirt. There was no Switch online stuff here, which makes me think, oh, we're are we going to get more Switch online stuff at the Switch 2 presentation. And what form does that take? We saved that for the meal, not the appetizer. I mean, Donkey Kong 64. Yeah, baby. Fair enough. They're shutting it all down for uh Switch Online 2. They're getting rid of everything else.

It's bunch of you know a couple of games that look uh interesting and stuff that might I might want to play and a lot of other things that I have no interest in but there's clearly a fan base for because they're always pushing games like that. I thought Witch Book Witchbrook looked neat. Uh, [\u00a0__\u00a0] Secret Life of Walter Schmidy or whatever. Uh, Eternal Lifeman. Eternal Life of Goldman. That's the one. Um, cool look at Metroid. Hadn't seen Metroid in a while. Right. This is the second time we've seen actual Metroid gameplay. Really, really neat seeing uh what they're cooking out over there.

Yeah, I mean I'm kind of kind of where you guys are. I think maybe at the end of the day maybe a little higher just because I appreciate I appreciate that uh Nintendo Directs in the last couple maybe like year or two have made space for uh collections of old games like the the Gradius thing and stuff like that. Like recently we got the Marvel vs. Capcom collection, the fighting collection. Like they just keep putting out these collections that I think are are good and like I'm such a fan of those old things so it's nice to see them back. the amount of HD remasters of classic JRPGs like we're somehow not done with that yet.

So I think that stuff's great. But on top of that, there was multiple uh announcements here that I'm excited about. Like Eternal Life of Goldman, like first time I've seen that. Really hyped for that now. Uh Everybody's Golf and Patapon. That's kind of big deal stuff just in terms of the inside baseball like what's that mean? And like it gets me so excited for um the some PlayStation IP that I would have never would have thought would ever come back in any way.

I don't think that this was bad and I think it's a little better than fine. I do struggle a little bit cuz like I feel like I'm always looking for the answers and uh to the questions we're asking.

It just kind of seems like maybe an oversaturation of I'm surprised cuz one of the things I predicted was that we would get maybe a little taste of Metroid Prime 4 here and then they would say look forward to the Switch 2 uh direct for even more about Metroid Prime 4. Because if Metroid Prime 4 is coming out on the Switch 2 release day, then it makes sense of why you don't say it here. But then if you're gonna have it here and not do the baton pass the Switch 2 directly, I just think that's weird. Yep.

Not like it's uh a pretty game by any means, but it's like I think it looks better. Um, yeah, it looks fun, which is great. Uh, and then, yeah, I just think that overall there was, uh, the Marvel game popping off for that. Uh, Emu have really been crushing it and they just continue to like with Ninja Gaiden.

We'll just see how far they take it. 6 months ago or whatever they put out the Nintendo music app and I think that that also has a lot of potential and so far I wouldn't say it was a failure but it also isn't succeeding as much as it can. Like they keep making weird decisions. They put out Kirby and the Forgotten Land soundtrack a couple days ago but they only put 23 songs from it and we're like hey the other songs are coming later and it's like you're drip feeding half of a soundtrack.

A game I'd recommend, especially the remastered version, to anybody. But here we are now. Andy, maybe you should just wait and play this one. Like I feel like that might be the move cuz like they're going to be very similar games, but like I do think that this one's going to be even more modern feeling and stuff and like I I just don't want you to get primed out.

I think that because of all of that, it's like there there there's going to be too many comparisons uh that are able to be made between the two.

We got to figure out how to make this super easy for them to understand. Oh, what if we called it a virtual game cartridge and just explained it like it's a virtual game cartridge. Now it's just way more confusing. When you guys were watching a chat was like, \"So, it's DRM with extra steps.\" And yeah, if that's like a conversation of uh DRM that they were having in like boardroom meetings, they're like, \"How how the [\u00a0__\u00a0] do we sell that to [\u00a0__\u00a0] It's the most like, hey, how do we Nintendoify this thing and like make it kind of cute?\" I know that they said virtual game cartridge, but the way it was being presented still made me feel like there was a physical component to it.

And more than that, as a Nintendo fan, the biggest issue I have with the physical digital conversation is I buy my games physical, but then I don't get them digital. So when I buy a physical game, I can't then play it on a different system without physically putting that card in. Yeah. And that's something that I I was hoping they were going to be like that's how it felt like they were setting it up at first. Um so I don't know that that seems like this seems like a let down to me there.

Cuz I like I the way I do it, right, with PlayStation, for example, I have a PlayStation at work and I have a PlayStation at home, right? It works so easy. I'm just logging a PlayStation at work and then I can play.
