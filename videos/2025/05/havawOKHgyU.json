I I try honestly I try that every single time cuz I'm not tall enough to where I can reliably get a spike. Like I've had maybe one or two this season where I was like, \"Oh dude, I was in it.

It seems this aligns with the concept art we've already seen for the project previously. The report also reinforces that what I've heard uh that even within a belleaguered Bungie, the game is viewed as very fun internally, the most enjoyable project in incubation. Not that I've heard marathon is bad or anything, but Gummy Gummy Bears is the one that keeps being brought up as going great. Look, games can be fun with friends all at at all times, you know, at all times. You know, I you bringing up that article also makes me think of uh you know, looking up what Gamer Rant had to write about this article and then them referencing an article that they wrote back in 2023 when Bungie tweeted in 2023, \"Incubation at Bungie is",

It draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog type games wrapped in a light-hearted comedic world.\" Wait, is that what they wrote today or is that something?

Speaking as part of its latest financial results, EA CEO Andrew Wilson called the next Battlefield a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment. Wilson also confirmed that Skate will be released during the next financial year and uh ending April 2026. Previously, EA has said Skate will enter early access sometime this calendar year. Andrew Wilson also said, \"I got a fuckload of money, man. I'm [\u00a0__\u00a0] I got stacks. I got I got 40 40 million in the bank right now. I'm 5'8, but on my money I'm 66. I I I giggled a little bit cuz earlier in chat BLP Entertainment says said more like Hung Solo. Wow. I don't know why. I thought you were laughing at the skates. No, I'm laughing at dumb chats, but I'm also laughing at the fact that Yeah, they I feel like they buried the lead cuz Yeah, cool. Battlefield before 2026, May, whatever. uh or April, but like skate, you know what I mean? Where's skate? Drop D drop skate.",

On Tuesday, a publication called Nexus Point News, published a headline for what looked to be a major piece of entertainment news. Exclusive. Alex Garland, set to direct Elden Ring film for 824. What a sentence. The article claimed that Elden Ring is expected to be Garland's next film and that shooting is expected to start in 2026. But don't get your hopes up. Soon after the article was published, Nexus Point News pulled it and the publication won't say why. How this news article made the rounds is interesting is an interesting case study in the way news travels on the internet. We first saw the Nexus Point news article from a Wario 64 post on X.

You it it would have to be I don't know how you could make this movie and and make it, you know, and make it make sense narratively. Yeah. It would be a lot of weird moving parts.

Like somebody somebody earlier in chats mentioned that Death Stranding also has a 24 movie involvement. And that makes way more sense to me just in as far as like the kind of story that Death Stranding is versus the kind of story that Elder Ring is where Elder Ring is almost more of a world than it is just a straightforward story because the nature of how they tell the story of Elder Ring. It is way more through discovery. It's way more through like you are arriving kind of at the end of the story and kind of getting like the history of the world you're in and like getting through reveals and like stuff of oh this is what I'm here to do like like it's it's just a very weird format to then try and tell through a",

Oh, I did want to answer the We got on a tangent, but to the GTA 6, will it harm the games industry? I have um I think it'll be both. I think it's in some ways it's going to harm, but in some ways it's going to help. I think it'll harm in the way that it's going to be another Roblox. It's going to be another Fortnite. It's going to be probably a bigger one of those. But people are paying for it. That's my thing that um like people are paying premium dollar for a",

That's my thing that um like people are paying premium dollar for a premium product and will hopefully be reminded you got to pay money for [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome games. And well then that's where I come right on the other thing because I still do think that like it's going to be a black hole game in the sense of all right less people are there's going to be less bandwidth of people playing other games in the midst of GTA 6 and I think that's going to be ongoing for a decade somewhat. But on the flip side I think yeah like you're going to have more people on gaming platforms because GTA 6 attracts not only the gamers but attracts the mainstream audience. And I think that you can have the main audience on gaming platforms like maybe peruse through PlayStation, maybe peruse through the through the Steam store when it comes to PC and all that [\u00a0__\u00a0] right?

A lot of the people that are g that would have spent that free time just on TikTok now they will be playing GTA 6 and hopefully that like is that is gonna you know reconfirm the thing of oh I can sp I can spend money on video games but I think even more so just have them on the platform and see those advertisements to be like oh man the split fiction game looks cool maybe I should check this out maybe I should play Death Stranding 2 or whatever like the games are out by then.
