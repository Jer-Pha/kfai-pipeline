We talked for about 30 to 40 minutes. I also had a conversation with Skillup and Dan Riker. Pretty cool. We in Tokyo, we were like, \"Yo, we should have a conversation since all three of us have played a lot of this [\u00a0__\u00a0] game.\" Between the three of us at that point, we had the conversation.

Cojima says he has a concept for Death Stranding 3, but he's not going to make it. This is Andy Robinson at Video Games Chronicle. Hideo Kojima says he already has a concept for Death Stranding 3 in mind, but insisted that he will not be the person to direct it. Kujima 61 is set to release the second Death Stranding game, On the Beach, exclusively for PS5 next month. Looking ahead, the Metal Gear creator has a full slate with Xbox title OD, a new action espionage game for PlayStation, and a movie in the works. So, it's perhaps unsurprising he feels like he likely won't be continuing Death Stranding himself. Speaking to VGC in a new death training preview, Kojima said that a concept",

Speaking to VGC in a new death training preview, Kojima said that a concept introduced in On the Beach, plategates could allow future death training games to take place in different countries around the world. I talked about uh the plate gates in my preview, but in short, plategates are now are the concept that are going to get you to different places because fun fact, Destinium 2 takes place mostly in Australia. Check out my preview for more that more about that. Quote, \"If I use this plategate concept, I could make endless sequels.\" He said, \"Quote, I of course don't have any plans to do that, but I already have a concept for another sequel. I'm not going to make it myself, but if I passed it on to someone else, they could probably make it.\" End quote.

Kojima also discussed how the CO 19 pandemic convinced him to change the theme for the second Death Stranding, which has the tagline, quote, \"We should not have connected.\" End quote. Quote, \"We released that training before the CO9 pandemic.\" Kojima explained, \"The world was heading towards isolation and division, such as the UK leaving EU. So I was saying, let's connect. We're headed for disaster if we don't connect.\" That was the theme, story, and gameplay for Death Stranding. After the release, just 3 months later, we entered the pandemic, and I was really surprised. It looked like Death Stranding in a way. In the real world, the 21st century, we have something similar to the Chairo network, which is the internet.

Cojima said he believes the same connectivity that helped people get through their lockdown experiences is now in fact dividing humanity. Quote, \"What happened was there are now people in our studio who work from home and I still don't know their faces. Even music concerts were cancelled and it all became online streaming. I understand this was unavoidable at the time of the pandemic. The same thing applies to schools. Instead of getting to play with your friends or learning from teachers, you just you just look at a screen online, which isn't any different from watching YouTube videos.

The Middleear creator said that he that even though he already had a concept in place for Death Training 2, after experiencing the pandemic, he felt it wasn't right and rewrote it.

The logo is a hint. You can see in the logo of Death Stranding that the strands are coming from below the logo with the theme of let's connect. This time in Death Stranding 2, you see the strands are coming from above above the logo. It's like the Godfather logo. Even throughout the game, you see strands for many people like doll man and the mech soldiers. Those are all hints. When you really start to think thinking about what it means to connect, you start to wonder dot dot dot. That's all I'll say for now. Mike, that's a bless. You hit me with a lot.

Let's just rewind all the way to the top. Yeah. Kima, 61 years old, has a lot on his plate already. Y we're talking about a third Death Stranding. The timelines on how to make big budget games are very large right now. So yes, Kajjima possibly not being on the third Death Stranding if it was going to go there. Understandable. Yeah, he has a lot on his plate. He's getting up there in age. Maybe it's time to pass the baton. Maybe his love for it isn't the same.

But like I think after people play Death Stranding one, many people thought maybe that's just going to be a oneanddone situation. I don't know if this is going to be the next big franchise for Kjima Productions. Now, you know, 5 years plus later, we're like, oh, we're getting Death Stranding 2. We're pretty excited about that.

There could be a twist after what I played. I have no idea. But when you think about what Kojima usually does, Metal Gear Solid 2 way different game from Metal Gear Solid 1. You're playing as a different character. You're like, you know, that jump from PS1 to PS2 kind of makes the gameplay feel different. MGS2 to MGS3, it's a prequel now.

There's the questions of do you think the mass appeal audience is going to buy in on this one and go, we want a third.

I I I I think yes to all that. I think I I Death Stranding one um as far as I understand was successful in terms of sales. Um I can double check to see what it did, but like the fact that we're getting a Death Stranding 2 published by PlayStation again means that Death Stranding one did well enough for PlayStation to be like, \"Oh, we should do another one of these or we should partner with them for another one of these.\" Um, I don't I don't know where the second half of the story goes for DS2, so that's tough to say.

Okay, they're talking about the Cairo Network. They're talking about the BTS. They're talking about the bridge babies. They're talking about like connecting the There you go. Yeah. The the BB. They're talking about connecting the um country in all the similar ways as they did in Death Stranding one.

Hangar 13, that was their first uh mafia game uh that they made, right? The other Mafia games were 2K check. Um and so that was a lot of learning from them and they took a lot of, you know, they they built off of a lot of what Mafia 2 was, which was much more open world, a bit more of that GTA kind of vibe. Yeah, Mafia was always a GTA like GTA clone for me. That's why I loved it so much. But Mafia 1, and this is why I highly recommend for people if they want to get a taste of kind of what the scope of this game is probably going to be, especially seeing from these trailers, go play Mafia 1, the uh definitive uh edition, which is the remake of the first Mafia that Hangar 13 worked on.",

And that was one that like they brought in new actors for it and all this stuff. Like that is 100% worth your time. If you're excited for a new mafia, uh, and you want something that's a bit more of like the classic mafia you know and love before we go to the old country, uh, I highly recommend uh, playing that cuz it's also it's not that long too.

We talked about the industry, about how Remedy was doing, and about the big changes the studio had been making. For a moment, we were talking about game budgets. I brought up the budget for Remedy's next big single player game, Control 2, which publicly which the publicly traded studio told investors is being developed for $50 million euros or $57 million.

Alan Wake 2's budget compared to Control 2's, Ratala told me, was a bit higher. And there we had it. In this era of ballooning game budgets, here was a rare instance of a development studio acknowledging that they'll be making their next big singleplayer game for less than their last one. Vertala believes that 50 million is enough to make a great remedy game. Quote, I think with that we can create excellent games. He said if if the team sticks to that budget and the game sells 2 million units, we are at break even per game. He added, quote, then then that then builds the basis that if we create excellent if we create an excellent game and it happens to sell 4 million or 5 million units, then we are really happy.
