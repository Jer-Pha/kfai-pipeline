Fans are at the core of everything we do at Fandom and we're committed to not only serving them but also supporting the creators they love and the sale of Giant Bomb represents a natural extension of that mission. We're confident Giant Bomb is in good hands and its legacy will live on with Jeff and Jeff. The joint statement from the Jeffs goes, quote, \"Giant Bomb is now owned by the people who make Giant Bomb, and it would not have been possible without the speedy efforts of fandom and our mutual agreement on what's best for fans and creators.\" The",

It was a it was a long week, but I'm glad to be here. I don't know where you want to start tackling this one, Jeff Grub, cuz I have about a gajillion questions about all of this. both when I've talked to you off the record long ago, when I talked to you more recently, when I talked I ran into Dan in Montreal, there's a lot of moving parts to this that I would jump cut to sat or no Friday night when you all put up your tweet.

And of course, he would not tell me straight up what was happening. So, I was left to hypothesize to the chat. And then Jen and I uh together while making dinner, and I was like, it's got to be that they're buying giant bomb. And we were both of but like that business deals like that don't move this quickly.

So, I was in meetings all day, every day for the entirety of last week, even in Boston. Flew into Boston for PAX, and I spent most of that time in a hotel room, uh, talking to other people, but it was worth it. We got it done.

Shout out to FandM on this. Like, I think it would have been very easy for FandM to be a giant corporation and say, \"Well, we own this brand and you don't matter and we're going to rebuild it or we're going to put it on the shelf and you don't get to have it. Go make up a new name. Do something else.\" They they could have done all these things and I don't know what negotiations were like or what those and I'm not asking to get into specifics about them but the fact that you were able to do this does speak to the fact that at least someone over there was like listen this brand is the personalities like you have to make this work this way.

I think about, you know, it's our 10th anniversary of going independent this year, right? I remember January 5th, 2015 as a blur that month. You know, I talked about it in my PAX keynote with Ben Star, right? Winning the Game Award is really where I was able to be like, \"Whoa, we've done something crazy here.\" like is are you able to understand right now or is it just meetings and just planning and just trying to get this thing going?

It wasn't something that people aren't familiar with, but I was doing this in a very hard way for a very long time. What felt like a long time to me. So in this moment when it was like this catharsis of actually getting to say it and it happening it was like difficult to like go into the moment and it like I was actually working on that throughout the entire panel just be like look into the audience like actually look at the people's faces instead of like sort of being like oh if I look in their faces their emotions will be will reflect my emotions and I'll have to deal with that like well now is the time I",

Although Nintendo's basic policy on tariffs is to treat them as a cost and factor them into prices, Purukawa uh also emphasized the need to sustain the momentum of Switch to sales and to make sure that the new console is widely adopted. Therefore, Nintendo will carefully consider various factors when changing any pricing, including its acceptability to customers. Jeffrey Grub, how [\u00a0__\u00a0] are we? Yeah.

That's about, you know, the, you know, it really cuts into the profit margin for a company like Nintendo, uh, still. So, they will still have to deal with that, but 30% is way better than 145%. 10,000%, right? Which is one of those stupid things that we're sitting here saying like, \"Oh, man.\" Okay.

One of the lead actors in the Fallout TV series says his character's arc ends around season five or six, suggesting its creators envision a long run for the show. Season two of the Fallout show uh just wrapped production last week, meaning it's still it may still be some time before it appears on Amazon Prime Video. However, during a recent panel appearance at Comic-Con Liverpool, actor Aaron Motin, uh, who plays Maximus in the show, said his character story is supposed to end three or four seasons later.

End quote. Motton's comments are obviously not confirmation that the series will last until season five or six because numerous factors could result in its cancellation before then. Jeff Grub, how many seasons of a Fallout show do you want? I I you know, it's it's tough because media has changed in terms of how you consume TV uh so much over time.

Everything matters to these characters. All of it is character development. It all it all fills in something in the end. Uh, but you don't want to try to elongate when you don't have something else to actually back that up. So, if they have enough for five to six seasons, I think they should just go to go to five and really just pack it in there and make it as good as possible. I love the idea of having an end point.

They're up there for free.\" And then when we didn't do that, they moved to subsidized snacks where they put them in and sold them for 25 cents. And that's when me and Nick Coen would go up there every day when they restocked the Pop-Tarts and buy all the Pop-Tarts in the machine for 25 cents cuz I was such a such a steal. Such a deal.
