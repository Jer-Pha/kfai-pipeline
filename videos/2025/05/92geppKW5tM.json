Twos and ones? Threes and ones? Who? Cuz that's usually what I say. They say ones and twos and I say twos and ones. Yeah, cuz I like the same numbers backwards like that. Huh? But I like the binary thing. Call you the binary god. Oh man. Big day for me, Kevin. Huge day for me. You beating this game today? No. God, no.
