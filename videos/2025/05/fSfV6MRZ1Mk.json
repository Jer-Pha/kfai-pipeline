We could probably teach him. The rain dance move is not good. That's like a That's just a status effect move. Yeah, that's when you put the rain dance up and then your water moves. I could teach him fly and basically he has a flying move of vortex air which is shoot for inflict damage has high circular hit ratio that's nasty and that's his special and his special attacks 99 which is better than his normal attack. So we keep in that move hydrop pump has a power of 120 but we've already decided we're not really hydrop pump people so we could pop that out. Yeah but then what's the point of rain dance?
