Each cardoggram affects which enemies, boss fights, and loot will appear when you enter the monolith, so no two excursions will be the same. Find even more cardiggrams to explore by looting defeated enemies, or buy them from other players online at the trading post. You'll need to make sure you have the right gear to take on the harder cardigs. Build your mercenary, choose your gear, master your abilities, and take down everything in your path in Imperial. Face off against enormous deadly bosses and seek out secret paths to find bigger and better loot. Help the members of the expedition in deep branching quests and aid other players in asynchronous multiplayer. Get ready, mercenaries, the monolith awaits.

Let's come over here to a safe spot and and patch you up. All right. Use um use the not the splint. Use the CMS. Do you need a splint? Use CMS twice. That's the C. Hold on. I got to drop something real quick. I'm going to drop that uh that shotgun stock. That's not worth it. The shotgun stock. I mean, who knows? Maybe things have changed and it",

So, whenever your uh limbs get blacked out to zero, he's not running. Is that you? That's you, Mike. Of course. Yeah, that's me. Oh, [\u00a0__\u00a0] You can bring Yeah. So, when everything's get blacked out, you can bring it back. You can't bring out your chest or your head, which usually when those get blacked out, you just die. But there are ways like from a slow bleed, it'll black out and you just lose it. Um, and then you die taking any damage. But if your arms and legs and stomach get blacked out from damage, you can heal them with the surgery kit. But it there's different surgery kits and they like take some of the health down so it doesn't heal as",

I don't think it's working on my They're good. So they're healed now. So now they're fixed. Now you have to actually heal. So now they're like they're brought back to being alive and now you heal them with a healing kit. So now what do I do here? So now he's now just sit there and press five over and over again essentially. This is me. All right, Mike, your choice. Do we go down the middle of the road here in all the heat and see if the flare is there to take the flare extract or do we just Yep. Let's go flare. There we go. Now flare it up.

Put a hot key on it so you can equip it. And you'll look up in the air pretty much right here. And shoot it up in the air. Let me double check exactly where you need to stand. I'm watching this guy if he was over there. Okay. Where do I want where I got to shoot it? Give me two more seconds. Just I want to make sure we don't get this wrong cuz I got it wrong some days ago.

Don't go any further past this and use the flare that you just got. Am I good? The flare and shoot it up in the air. Okay. And look like a couple degrees down. It should work out either way. There you go. Nice. Perfect. Now, let me test it first. Let me test it first. In theory, we're not going to die walk over here. If I die, you're gonna go uh behind this fence line and to the left, and that's take you to the medical place. Okay. In theory, we can walk over here and not die. About to find out. We're good.
