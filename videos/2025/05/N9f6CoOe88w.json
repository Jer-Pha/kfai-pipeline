Good day to you. It's a great day, actually. Yeah, it's a very rare time that me and you are in this very position where we are reviewing a all things considered new game, but like not at embargo, but it is like our official reviews of the game. Like while the game's still kind of in the the conversation, the discourse is still relevant. Like it's kind of a fun place to be. Obviously, uh you and I very busy men for different reasons gallivanting the globe. Uh you literally going all the way to Japan. I went to Vegas, you know what I mean? There was a lot going on. But no, because of all of that, we weren't able to be here and actually be on the review for Clear Obscure Expedition 33 with the rest of the crew.

It's not that common that the majority of kind of funny are all into a game enough to prioritize playing through it for a review conversation, let alone a spoiler conversation. I feel like usually when that's the case, we're talking about the game of the year. Usually, it's usually the case. Usually it's the game of the year. Yeah. And um that I feel also is uh there's a couple factors at play there. Normally I would say PlayStation games um there was a lot uh PlayStation Studios games a lot of the gamers here tend to like those type of games budget prestige narrative action adventure. In addition to that PlayStation are uh usually very good about getting us as many codes as we want. Whereas on the Nintendo side we normally don't get that.

Um, and there's been exceptions to this, but often we don't end up doing a full multi-person review of big Nintendo games just because like the conversation kind of like moves on a little bit, right? Then there's the Xbox side of it. Xbox are amazing about getting us codes. Um, I just feel like we're still kind of in the point of the Xbox games being a little bit more tailored to interests. Yeah. Like not everybody here is gonna play Doom. You know what I mean? Not everybody here is going to play a Hellblade or a I mean, South of Midnight, I think, got it the good majority of us. Yeah, that's a good point. But it's like, you know, it it's kind of here or there as far as what Xbox",

And so for for a game like this to come out and uh to have all of us so interested, so many people like fighting to be on the review like there there was so much interest that it was like, \"Oh man, we have more than enough uh people and conversations to have around this game and the audience wants more and more conversations about this game, which I think is very special and cool.\" So I'm happy to be here with you and have this space to be able to talk about all this stuff today.

I look at the combat and how well fleshed out the turn-based combat is, how each character has their own combat system and their own style of combat that are each very inspired, right? I think it's one thing to be toward the beginning of the game and uh have a new party member and go, \"Oh, okay. They got a different thing going on and then like, you know, kind of like find that to be cool versus being in the, let's say, second half of the game and looking at a character and being like, \"Oh, this is inspired by Devil May Cry. Oh, this is inspired by this. Oh, like you know you want me to think about using this character in this specific ways, let alone looking at the Pictose and Luminous system, right?

How that stuff layers with, you know, status effects and applying burn and but your other character has this thing that if you attack them while they have burn, they then get plus two AP, which you know allows them to use their special moves quicker, right? It all builds on top of each other in a very cool and fascinating way. I I made a tweet last night or a post on Blue Sky I should say last night that there's some game or pretty much me playing any game is me playing it and being like, \"Man, this would go hard in a rog light mode.\" And I that was inspired by me playing clear obscure expedition 33 and being like, \"Ah, dude, this combat system could be really fun like if you rogitized it,",

I just want to get into the combat.\" Um, I think that part of that part of the game is excellent when you talk about story and characters. My god, my god. My god. Um, they do such a good job of pulling your interest from the get- go. That prologue segment. I I played it alongside a friend, right? And like we were watching it and we were like, \"Yo, this is [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome.\" I love how from the get-go they in the first couple hours of the game you invoked certain feelings I had toward the end of Infinity War, right? like the fact that you can pull that out of me and then I think sustain a lot of wonder, a lot of interest in all right, what is this world?

It it reminds me of uh the words they said a lot during the Nintendo store um uh preview that we got to go to. They used the words surprise and delight. This game surprised and delighted me at so many moments of the story's uh twists and turns made me fall in love with the characters. I love the utter grim uh tone of it or I don't know if grim is the right word, like dower tone of it, right? It's a sad [\u00a0__\u00a0] world. It's a sad [\u00a0__\u00a0] story.

And I think this game does that so well. But then the last part I want to touch on is the art and the presentation of it. This game is so good to look at. It does, you know, I'm a big fan of Persona uh Persona 5, one of the best looking games I've ever played. I'll say the same for Metaphor Refantasio as far as what those games bring in terms of art style and UI and all that stuff. You could tell that this game was inspired u not directly as far as like what it does art style-wise, but I think inspired as far as how hard you should be able to go or how how hard you should go to really uplift that stuff. when you look at the combat UI and you see kind of",

It all just comes together so well, let alone the environments, let alone how dreamy and weird everything looks, but in a way that still comes together and really fits the mold of what they're doing with this world. I this game for me was just so amazing to look at from beginning to end. I didn't even talk about the soundtrack. Soundtrack's [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome. Oh my god. Yeah, this game does so many good things. That said, I do have critiques here and there and like stuff that's not even just like super minor. Like stuff that I think really uh uh",

But I think that's both in when you're in the levels and you go to a save point and come out of it and being like, \"All right, everything kind of looks the same.\" So, which way was I going? There are quite a few times where I think the game would benefit from either either a waypoint or a mini map or something. Like, I don't know what the solution is, but I think there's a solution that they could have happened upon to orient the player in a right way. And then also like there are parts toward the latter half of the game, even the last third of the game where I'm looking at the overworld map and I'm like, \"Okay, where have I been?\" like where like what's the right place to go?

I I never would have been able to put this into words but the moment he said it to me I was like that's exactly how I feel about this game.

I want the And that's what this is for me.

Like you're saying, that prologue immediately gets you hooked. But throughout the entire game, the twists and the turns and the way that it just keeps giving you more and more and more. I was absolutely enthralled from moment one and that's just talking about the story and characters and world. You add on the gameplay here and oh man, every single battle is fun.

I am I'm so impressed with this. I do really think though that um I I I see in the chat already, and I know that people disagree about this, but I do think this game needed a mini map. I do think that even on the world map, it needed a bit more than just a compass of northeast, uh west, and south. Um so many amazing decisions in this game.

I don't know if you ever I don't know if you ever played Life of Strange one or heard the discourse about the ending choice, but like that's one of those ones where everybody has a very strong opinion about what what the right choice is. And this was one of those scenarios where, and this is rare for me, maybe this is a first for me, where I made my choice because I knew where my allegiance lied. I chose Myel uh because I think partly",

And then also like Verso, I got the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of here halfway through the game. There was a boss fight where like Verso was in my team. And then like that boss fight made me realize that Verso just wasn't doing what I needed him to do. Me and you had the exact same experience in this case. That's so I was like Verso, you're out. Get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] get in here. Get in here Lun. Um and so like I that's what I did. So, I I um was leaning towards male because of that, but then also I think story-wise, the game the way the game orients you leading into the third act and like going through learning what the nature of the painting is and like what",

And so like I think as I made the male choice, I was still in that mind frame, but then seeing the cut scene after and then like well seeing the cut scene after I think made me feel this feeling of like I don't feel good. Like this didn't make me feel good. Which is beautiful because games aren't like games don't have to make you feel good. But stories aren't like meant to automatically make you feel good, right?

Um but if you do, it's really fascinating. And I actually went back after beating it just cuz I was like I I felt like I sped through the prologue the first time and just walking around and getting to learn like where Lumiere is at with the context of the whole story they go on is so fascinating. And um I'm blanking on her character's name. Is it Sophia Gustav's? Oh, the one um Oh, Sophie. Is it Sophia? It's one of the two. I think probably Sophie like Sophie with a accent U on the E. Uh yeah, like the the story between the two of them might have been",

But the more you kind of talk to all the characters around in the the prologue and and to her and the game starting with you and myel like going to see her and all that stuff, you start to realize there's this like deep conversation about having children and what that means in a world where if you were to have a child now when we're at expedition 33, you are dooming that child most likely to die by the age 14 n whatever. And these are the type of things that are like that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] good. And the reason that Sophie Sophia and Gustav broke up is because they couldn't decide about the ethics of having a child. That's some good [\u00a0__\u00a0] stuff, man. Some real good [\u00a0__\u00a0] Right. I I also did the thing where I rushed through the prologue. Like I I",

Now, honestly, this game does um a thing that I love where now I'm kind of like, yo, I should replay the whole thing cuz you talk about like the conversations you have with like the people that are fading or whatever, and it's like, oh, now that I have the context, I want to go back and see all those conversations. Yeah. Yeah. Me, too. And it it's a thing where I I'm so happy that this game's available in as many places as it is.

And it's the dumb goopy gamer goblin blade I have is not allowing me to be like well I can still do that on Steam. For some reason I'm like but now here's where I'm at now. Yeah. Why am I thinking this way? I'm like, \"Well, eventually this game is going to be announced for Switch, too.\" And I don't know why that excites me. I mean, you could also just with replay it on PlayStation for the I know, but but I'm thinking if I'm replaying this, I do feel like that'll be a travel thing that I'll be like I'm chilling in bed or whatever.

Like, I feel like this stuff it's they don't shy away from like real [\u00a0__\u00a0] in this. Yeah. Yeah. And that's one of I wanted to mention this earlier like toward the m middle part of the show because we're talking about how this game totally like you know goes into very serious places, right? And like how that compares to other things. Like I don't want to take it away that other GRPGs oftentimes can be and are serious. And like again I think this game takes so much from uh Near that also I think has really good serious [\u00a0__\u00a0] going on. But I think it's the I don't know.

Sometimes you're feeling we sometimes you're feeling woo. Oh, that's good. I like that. There we go. I like that. That would be a great place to end, but I'm not going to because we had a couple more super chats here. Limstar says, \"Safe to say Jennifer English's work is one of the greatest of all time.

Impeccable. Absolutely impeccable. There's some line delivery from Mel in the last fight versus Verso that like I had to do that fight a few times because I when I did Verso's ending, my Verso was not leveled up for me because I stopped using him. And so I I lost like three times and I was like, \"All right, I'm going to go into the menus, redo my pictos and all that stuff.\" But like there are certain scenes where she's pleading to Verso of like stop like all this stuff.

Uh Mr. Hawk says, \"Before the patch, I hit 21 million damage on a single hit.\" Hell yeah. Send me the build. Uh and then the final one for today comes from Golden Spider saying, \"How likely do you think Expedition 33 will win game of the year this year?\" To me, it's a no-brainer. Only thing I can possibly see challenging it is Death Stranding 2. I before jumping in because before you jump in because you have uh hands-on experience with Death Stranding 2.
