Who would like to start? I'll start. Go for it, Andy. I had never seen this before. Had no idea what it was about. Didn't know uh that Fast Bender was in it. What a surprise. I like I just didn't know what this movie was. It was kind of at a weird point in time where I mean, not that I was ever keeping up with Alien News, but I don't know.

That like just that little thing like that's got to be a preferred partner. That's a real Z. That's a real preferred partner right there. Um do it. Yes. Don't worry. But um yeah, I I I still enjoyed this movie. I really enjoyed the freaky ass design of The Aliens. I I don't think it's like a good movie in terms of a lot of like storytelling and and maybe pacing.

Like I I really don't. And I think there are multiple movies that are uh worse than this and this is better then. But watching this was such a slog and especially after coming off of Prometheus and so much of what I liked most about this movie is the stuff they're following up on from Prometheus. It just felt a little directionless and it felt like all right it it felt cash grabby in the way of like Michael Fasbender was great but we put him in an alien movie that wasn't called Alien. Let's just put him in a movie that actually call it Alien. And that that kind of feels like the end of all of it. All of it to me. Like uh I don't think that much of this was",

And I feel like so many of the movies that we've watched have done everything this movie does even okay, just so much better. Whether it's the creature design that I get what they were going for here. I think they kind of went a little too far with some of them. Um the insistence on trying to come up with potential origin stories for all of these aliens is another thing that I just don't think we need. Um so much of the the action is silly. the flute on the flute teaching scene, the Michael Fbender on Michael Fastpender stuff. Like I enjoyed, but I don't think I'm supposed to. It was like such a goofy flex of like what is this 1989 where I'm supposed to be impressed that they're talking to each other? Like they're spinning the camera back and forth. Like",

And I think that I think the David versus Walter like conversations are the only interesting philosophical like themes that we explore in this entire movie. The rest of it is literally well well more in territory. We've done all this already in the first film and this coming out in 27 like again uh the the flute stuff and the um David as a character and like thinking about the concepts of creator versus creation and what the power dynamics are and what would you say face to face with your creator?

And I out of any of these Alien movies, I did not look at my watch more than this one. Like, constantly, I'm just like, I would rather be doing anything than watch this. And this was the first time one of these ended, I'm like, I can't believe we have more of these movies to watch. Like, I think we finally hit the point of like, I'm done being like, hey, I'm having a fun time with the ride. Like, I did not have fun with this movie.

I just don't think they executed much of what could have made it cool. Yeah. I I I think the movie could have been better if it wasn't for the fact that it was a sequel to Prometheus because there's a lot of really interesting stuff here, but it's well warned territory.

I've never seen classic John Hughes film, but he was it it when it ended, the test audiences didn't like the original ending. So, the studio made him change it and he hated that. So, what he did was he remade the movie, retold it with Some Kind of Wonderful. And Some Kind of Wonderful is a better movie, but it's boring as [\u00a0__\u00a0] cuz it's literally the exact same story as Pretty and Pink with just the roles, the the two main roles gender swapped. And so I think this movie standalone you're like there's some cool stuff going on in this but the fact that it literally is just almost the exact same movie as Prometheus as far as the characters concerned.

Like, you know that there's a there's only one person in all of the Alien franchise who's ever been like, \"Hey, man, there's something on that dude's face. We can't let him back up the ship.\" And it's Ripley. And then the only reason why they did it was because, you know, there was a conspiracy to let the guy back on the ship because Andrew did it. But in this, it makes no sense. Like they're coming back. This guy's spitting [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of his [\u00a0__\u00a0] mouth. Get him in your face. Don't touch anything.

But it makes me not like it just really makes me not like these characters. The same problem I have with Prometheus where I'm like, you got to write smart characters and you got to put them in a situation where it's it's a conundrum. It's it's difficult, right? But in this there it's a no-brainer. The guy's pale as a ghost spitting up black stuff and they're like, \"Get him onto the ship ASAP.\" And the lady has one moment she's like, \"Ah, I don't know.\" Ah, yeah. Okay, [\u00a0__\u00a0] it.

And I do like the concept that he like decided to create his own like Garden of Eden where he could create all these crazy things and like this this menagerie of horrors. And I think the ending might be one of the best endings in all of Alien movies even though you see it coming, but it's kind of ter Katherine Wat is like just terrified as she falls asleep and you're terrified for her and then he spits up little, you know, all that stuff is all that stuff is amazing. I just think they earned that ending. By the time we get there, I'm like, I'm glad that Billy Critter died.

You're like, I I want this to end. Man, I actually legitimately forgot there was a whole other action sequence in the cargo hold of this, which was very so sad cuz I think conceptually these movies are so badass. They're so cool on paper and they're just ultimately some really big fumbles cuz you could have had you could have had some of Hollywood's best writers and imaginators like taking this source material and making like true magic with it.

Well, I think the permutations of it, right, where he had to he had to cross pollinate to get the face huggers in the egg. Yes.

Throughout this entire thing, we've argued over and over again, was the aliens sleeping or dying, right? So, like every time we throw out any criticism of this [\u00a0__\u00a0] movie, some nerd burglar in the chat pops up and is like, well, remember they die really quickly.
