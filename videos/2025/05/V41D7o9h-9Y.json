I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the master of hype, Snowike Mike. Hi, Greg. Uh not too happy that you're saying the final episode because I've been having so much fun with these been way too fast getting to spend time with these two guys has been pretty great and uh talking all things Elder Scrolls Online has been pretty amazing. Of course these two guys none other than Rich Lambert of course game director of the Elder Scrolls Online. Hello. How are you? I am fantastic today. Are you going to miss us? Yes, actually. Oh you I'm looking forward to going home but yeah this was fun. Maybe we can maybe we can share you know our characters. Maybe we get to play with a great idea. How many characters do you have, Rich? Too many. Are they on every platform as well? Just everywhere? Uh, I mean technically yes, but I really only play on PC on the",

He is the big cheese studio director. Studio director. Zenamax online studios. Yeah. And actually after the after the last episode, uh, Rich and I were talking a little bit about the Robert segment. We were talking about when we were talking about Robert Alman and it's like it's really hard to get across kind of the culture that that we have that results from that. But we were we were trying to figure out a way to say it so that people would understand that that are listening to this. But I I think it comes down to loyalty, right? It's like he was loyal to us, right? It was not a traditional, you know, CEO uh relationship where if he believed in what you were doing,",

And we were all pointed in the right direction. Yeah. I mean, one of the reasons I'm here is because of him. You know, I when I started here, Robert had just opened up a small satellite office in the Hunt Valley area to keep a small number of engineers and artists u because they lived in Pennsylvania and they had to drive to Rockville every day and they just that's like what two hours each way, something like that. And they were like, \"We can't do this and he's like, \"What would it take? What if I open something closer?\" And they were like, \"Yeah.\" And he's like, \"Okay, done.\" And he did. That's awesome.

And it's that it just if he believed in something, it it was going to happen, right? Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. It actually leads me to something, but I'll get to that one second.

But before we get to the community, which is what this episode's all about in the future and the cool stuff you're doing, I want to come back to this uh leadership question, uh we haven't talked at all about Xbox buying y'all. What's that been like? Cuz from the outside, I think they've done such a great job of keeping it like, no, you are Zenamax Online Studios. That's Bethesda. That's it's its own thing. It's a brand still. Yeah. They bought Zenamax for great games, right? And a great game publisher. So, um, it's in their best interest and our best interest to keep doing what we're doing, right?

So, a lot of change happened very quickly and um, you know, it was it was the pandemic was was tough, right? It was it was it was really hard. We haven't gotten into what that did to ESO and and maybe where our numbers just exploded and our servers melted, but uh, Right. But that changeover happened then and that was the least problematic by far of all the other things that were happening, right? It was literally just smooth, seamless to, you know, we got support from Zenamax and now now it's now it's Xbox, right? So they just let us do what we do. I was going to say, yeah, I I know again this is a new relationship. Obviously, we're about to talk about these COVID numbers and what it did for the game, but",

This is going to be the best RPG of all time. Go do it. Go do it. Does that seem to be the same case here? Like obviously different. This is an established product that's been running for 10 years live. So, like basically, are they staying out of the way of what you want to do? Yeah, I mean I mean yeah, absolutely. It's like you tell us what what you need. Uh there are a few wrinkles like uh it's more fiscal year based. It's a It's a public company, right?

He understands exactly what we're trying to do in the sense of we're delivering an experience to a group of gamers and we've proven that we can do it, right? And and so as long as we keep doing that, that that that's what he's looking for. Is there anything that interests you that Xbox and Microsoft have done? I think about cloud gaming, right? and having your game just so readily available at a click of a button. Has that impressed you guys? Is that something you take advantage of and think about for the future? Yeah. Well, we did have Stadia. We did. We did have a Stadia client, so we were actually ahead of the curve. Poor one out.

And it's great. Like it's uh that's the cool part of working with a with a giant company that's technology forward thinking. They said the word loyalty and it's really stuck with me, Greg, you know, and I think it's really impressive, right? You talk about loyalty and what Robert meant to all of you and what he kind of brought to it all and what you guys have done with your community and the community right back that loyalty of hey this is 10 years plus of course with you guys on the back end but it's wild I think loyalty is a big one with MMOs of",

It really stands out to me. Yeah, it it's a relationship, right? It's like, you know, they have lots of options, right? And uh a lot of the developer virtual world developer community relationship is trust and and loyalty, right? And and they they trust that we'll do the right things, mostly the right things, right?

So, Greymore launched uh in June of 2020, which is like 6 weeks after we all went home. Yeah. And so, that meant the content was in the can pretty much. We were in testing, you know, for that bug fixing, but the live services aspect of of Greymore when all these players came in and we had, you know, you can go back and look on the message boards and social media, right? It was a it was a time when we had to put a lot of work into server stability and and and bringing more stuff online and uh it was again a good problem to have",

I mean and not to mention I think it's so easy for even the way you're talking about it to us as players to think about we're on lockdown we're at home we just want to play this game you're also developers who have now been forced home and I imagine the entire pipeline is completely screwed up. Well, fortunately, we're a live service game and because we're a live service game, we have the concept of remote access to things and and so we had some of the technology VPNs and everything already built out so that we could access uh stuff from home. So, also we already had a somewhat distributed development environment um um for ESO. So, you could work on one part of the game and another p person could",

So, you could work on one part of the game and another p person could work on the same part of the game and then you checked it in. And so, so you really didn't have an excuse then. I mean we I think we were 3 days off of our original launch date. Amazing. So right but it was the human interaction of course you know the decision-m was slower the being able to identify problems was slower identifying solutions was slower that that's where that's where it really affected us. It was really eye opening to because we always took it for granted. All of those water cooler talks, right? The random wandering around, you see something, you ask a question. Like all of that went away because everybody was now at home and you had to book a meeting in order to get somebody, you know, attention because they're off in their own little world doing things. And so all of that",

And so all of that collaborative stuff we had to relearn how to do remotely. And you'd be shocked at how many game development problems get solved by just happen stance when you just walk by somebody's desk and see something or you're in the cafeteria getting lunch and you talk about this problem and you're like, \"Oh, we got a solution.\" And you they solve it there before it becomes a problem. We had to learn, like I said, how to do all of that all over again. And it was it was tough. Yeah, for sure. So then you get that pipeline down. Not that long after, what is almost, correct me if I'm wrong, a year later, you launched the Xbox Series X/S and the PlayStation 5 client, right? We totally forgot about that. Yeah. Yeah. We've done a few things in this decade of this game being live. Yeah, we did that in the",

So, uh it's very scalable and we spent some time and resources to make it support the modern shaders and DLSS and you know all the Yeah. All the the new occlusion system. Uh our graphics guys love that. Yeah. Just love that. As they should. Yeah. Yeah. And it's uh it Yeah. And it looks fantastic. Like it basically brought our PC ultra uh spec to console. Um, and it and it runs great. And it also we could do performance modes. We could do uh 60 frames a second or you could do do fidelity mode at 4K. And so it's just we know it's 60. That's 60. Yeah. Everybody does. It's Yeah. But uh fidelity mode is great if you're doing screenshots and and stuff like that, but you can but you can switch back and forth so easily that that",

So then start bringing me let's get I want to start bringing you I guess back to community. We're talking about back uh in episode two when we talked about the console launch. Uh one of the things that we celebrated there was 500,000 concurrence across all platforms. Did what did those numbers compare when we're talking to co we got we didn't get quite that much but it was in the ballpark. Okay. Um and again we had launched so much content between 2015 and and 2020 that we couldn't support the concurrency that we did in in 2020.

I know you've tal we talked on the show uh Matt about the player the different types of players and the players who do check in once every 11 months. There's the big drop. I'm good. It's different this year. It's different this year. We're changing it all up. Uh, but like if not, where are we at in terms of what the Elder Scrolls online audience looks like on a day-to-day basis? And I know that's really impossible to put a number on, nor would you probably want to, but like however you want to answer that question.

And we got a lot of feedback from our players that just like other games kind of like this, you know, like uh Animal Crossing and, you know, where you can just go and live a virtual life that's not part of your your normal day-to-day routine was very important to a lot of people. And we saw an explosion in housing videos because a lot of people are literally virtually nesting and making a and making a place again that made sense that they could outfit that made them feel better about about what was happening. And that was uh you know that's that's almost a responsibility at this point for for us to to do that because we know it was so important to people maintaining their sanity for uh for that time.

And uh it was really cool. Right. It's like they took the tools that we gave them and started, if you look at housing videos on YouTube for ESO, it's not houses, man. They make animated robots and and uh balloons. I It's just crazy. Uh uh somebody did a Japanese medieval village in uh in our housing system and it's it's crazy stuff we would never would have would have thought of and it's it's amazing and we're really happy that we can support that.

Yeah. Right. And so that's kind of where the community is now, which is like it it grew in not just in size, but it grew in understanding of what the virtual world that they're in is. Is that I was just going to say the community now, you know, when they're talking like FPS, you know, high FPS and things like that, it's not like performance of the game. It's it's fashion per second now, right? Like that's that's their thing. I love it. I love it. That's their thing now, right?

There's no right or wrong way to play this the you know the do you feel like that's really where that message comes from and took off like before that but when it was just was it just questing and it was guilds and it was traditional in quotes MMO. No, no. I I Well, at launch it was at launch it was, but once we did one Tamriel and got and got Yeah. it turned into a you can play the game many different ways and all of them are fine.

And I guess that's the big question I would ask you is like why is community so necessary essential to your game? Like obviously players equals money. Yeah. I mean, I we know the financial, but I mean, it's that idea again that I've said on this show throughout all of these episodes of like I could talk your ear off about the games that haven't made it, that didn't do the thing, that even had a community and still didn't make it, but somehow 10 years later, you are all still rolling and still pushing giant updates and making changes.

Otherwise you get like Bodie McBoat Face and stuff like that. But um but yeah, like you have to listen to them. You have to look at what they're doing and and we try really hard to be a part of that community. You know, we do a lot of different um community events.

There's about 100 100 people there and we did a bunch of cool events and whatnot. Um, but we met a few of the content creators and a few people in the community and then the following year more came and there was this one, you know, really nervous young lady who, you know, brought me this this she said her English wasn't good, but it was fabulous.

Fast forward a few years, they missed last year's tavern because they were having a baby and they were together. And when we went back for Gamescom, um, we ended up having dinner with them. I brought the the the kid out to for us to meet and all that other stuff. So that's incredible. Like yeah, they would have never have met if it wasn't for ESO and that's just super super cool.

Well, we just went through a series of pretty pretty crazy tests on live towards the end of March and and we're recording this before the test happen. So So literally they're experimental tests. So So we don't know how they'll turn out, but we're confident that information will come from them that we can use. The whole goal of doing this test is to prove out performance, some of the performance problems that we've had in in Ciridol and in the larger scale battles. Um, and it's it's focused really on the abilities, the combat, how much we can jam through kind of that pipe. You think of a fire hose. Yeah. It's only so big.

Um, we've got Imperial City, which is this hybrid PvE PvP thing, which is tons and tons and tons of fun. And the story line is phenomenal in there. You know, the Drake of Blades is awesome. That whole story line is really cool. So, there's and then dueling, right? So, those are kind of the the avenues for our PVPers to to uh to get their thing on. Yeah.

It's just that it happened that our user base, the massive numbers of users came in and were not interested in PvP. However, a very important part of the community is massively interested in PvP and uh by by giving the PvE questing uh people abilities um all of the armor sets doing the champion system, right? uh doing the PV gear chase that adds items literally to to the game and each one needs to be a little unique and special and each one requires some CPU uh when when the player does it in the game and when you add that to a PVP system where 900 players are in are in game at one time it's stopped being able to work basically so",

And the point of these tests is to redo the ability system just in Ciridil, just in the PvP part of the game and get back up to the 900 that uh that we had, which was 300, 300, 300. So, it's it's a three-sided PvP game. So, it's a natural evolution of the game. And and I know our PVP players that really want to go back to that have been very frustrated with us.

But now it's time to go back and actually look at the PVP system and and make it performant. And it's going to come if this test works. It'll be you have a separate set of abilities in PvP than you do in PvE. They're named the same they are in PvE. It's not that. It's just they just act a little differently in PvP to be much more performant. Gotcha. How Thank you for coming to my TED talk. No, I thank you for open up the door. I love you.

It it's a constant weighing you know resources versus pandemic versus uh you know servers melting because too many people are like right all these take resources to deal with and so which is why we haven't been able to do PvP for a long time because the servers melting as part of uh part of the pandemic was directly would have directly affected the number of people in Siridil because it was a CPU too many people on the servers problem.

This is something we could not have done in the chapter model because we were forced to launch something every June 1st and we just didn't have the resources to to do things like this that took obviously engineers away, designers away. So now that we're stretching the the motto out so we're not launching content quite so big content quite so often and definitely not on the same calendar day every year it gives us the chance to pry out these six 8w week tests that the time to develop them 3 months whatever it takes that we can do these experiments right and now if this works right we have the basis for a system that then we can flesh out into a real real new seridil that has its own kind of gear orability chase that's much more performant yeah and the the part to that as well is there's just some problems that are much harder to diagnose than others.

Like we use bots and things like that, but a bot can't replicate what a player does. And so like trying to track that stuff down and we've done a ton of these types of tests over the years like Ed Tofo and Brian Wheeler, you know, Brian Wheeler is our lead combat and PvP designer and Ed TFO is [Music] CT tech director now studio tech director um who did a lot of the server stuff. They worked hand in hand for like 3 years working on the servers trying to get the performance better and it helped significantly but it still didn't bring us over the that threshold where players stopped feeling that that input lag that lag.

Let's turn group healing you know on so no NPCs no wonder right drop a bomb on it. We went through a ton of different things. And so this this serial test that we're doing um or have done by the time this goes goes live um is that next evolution in there to kind of go through and incrementally test where the problem is and it's maddening to us because we can't fix it. We can't right like it's it's really really hard to do. So that's again that probably sounds like an excuse. No. Yeah. Well, well, to illustrate and and this is a uh a very live service game design story like so there are you know every every gamer knows uh FPS frames per second course.

There's also server frames per second which is how which is how how many how many cycles a server can perform every frame. And so, uh, the problem with our PVP system is it just like on a client, our server gets bogged down when too much stuff goes through it and the FPS goes way down. So, uh, we actually over over time when our players were thinking we weren't doing anything about PvP, we actually got our server frames for for Siridil from like 700 down to 300, right? You know, which is like half, which which is a miracle that we did that. But the problem is anything over like 70 was unacceptable to the players. Right. Right.

I'm like, \"Oh man, like you in my world would get to publish a YouTube video once every six years and then look at those comments and do it.\" Whereas for us in kind of funny, there is this joy and pain and everything else of we do this every day and when you don't like it or don't connect with it,",

You definitely after a certain point, we've all been here long enough to with with that internet thing, is that you you can look at a comment and pretty easily tell if it's in good faith. Yes. Right. And even if it's it's full of things you don't want to hear, if it's in good faith, there's something there that you should probably take account. And then there are some that's just whatever.

First of all, the it's a and I I I I say this all the time and I know it it sounds like a shtick, but we are a virtual world as much as we are a game. So, we attract people that aren't necessarily in it to dominate. And whenever you're in a game that's about domination or winning or or competing, right, you get a totally different type of person. Not they sure do, Mike. Yeah. You want to tell your stories of playing Fall Guys and just stopping to throw people off?

Stick with them because they're going to do the right thing. And I think there's something to that there like the the lack of immediate giant success meant that we had to fight for it and our community we did have a lot of very supportive community even back when we were a meme right of of and and there were people that were fighting back against that and those are the people I think that are the core of the community that when you log into the game as a new player and they're playing and they ask a question like it's in their best",

Something we haven't talked about that's an interesting call back to you Matt of course is that you wanted to do an MMO for Fallout. Then it that of course didn't happen. You came over here this happens. But then Fallout 76 does happen and Fallout 76 has such a similar story of stumbling out of the gate but having an audience and finding it to it to where of course they have this giant explosion with the Fallout TV show let alone I'm sure CO numbers going up.

We get to see the wowing trailers and as fans, it is always cool of, wow, oh my gosh, I'm blown away. the hard work that goes behind it and the decision- making of what those are, those characters that may or may not return. What is the excitement level for the team when it is, hey, this is the moment we're going to share this big thing. Who makes those decisions? What kind of fun do you have? Yeah, I mean you Rich",

And so that's what we try to do. You know, both of us are now uh at the point where we're not and we can't get involved so much in the day-to-day decision-m because there's so much of it. But we really try to keep the team pointed at the at the place we're trying to get to. Yeah. And and the team the team loves making new stuff, but they also love going back and bringing back those beloved characters, right?

Uh, you know, I think again like you guys have built something so special, but again, even to go watch that direct or hear you talk about it for four hours and the passion and the love and the care and the, you know, this is 10 years of the game. Sure, like we said, but since 2007, right, like it's such a healthy chunk of your lives, your professional careers, and the fact that you've been given this opportunity to grow it and you have and you've changed it like I hope you both are incredibly proud of what you've made and everybody obviously uh back home working on it or and their homes working on it, you know what I mean? how separated the company is.

Like we try to set the direction, but but you know, there's a lot of people. It takes a village to do a game like this and we have a good village. Yeah. And and it's it really isn't it's going to sound cliche, but it is really an honor to be able to represent the team. Sure. Right. Like obviously Matt and I don't do all the work. Um, there's a lot of really smart people that are really really passionate about the game and we get to talk about this thing that, you know, they have put their lives into.

I need to have you tell me what is everybody excited for? It is Friday, May 23rd right now. What is going on? What is coming? What is the big push this year? This is a new way for us to tell stories in ESO, right? This year is focused on the worm cult. You know, this is a continuation of the base game story. There's a brand new way for you to build your characters with our subclassing. So now you can, like I said earlier, you can be a necromancer wardenist if you want, right? Like you you have all of these abilities. I think it's over 3,000 combinations of class abilities that get added to your your repertoire if you want. Um, we've got uh Solstice, which is a brand new island with um some very cool stories um focused mainly around the Argonians and the high elves. Sounds weird, but it makes makes a lot of sense.

Um, and then of course we've got the the big soulwall event which is the first time we've ever done this that's based on servers. So each server will progress their own way. Um, and then we we cap that all off with all kinds of cool quality life improvements um and and whatnot which we didn't really talk too much about um comes under modernization. Right. Right. Comes under comes under modernization.

And it's like the warehouse in in Indiana Jones% like literally you walk in and you see just rows of top multiple houses that have this, right? And and so we implemented a a furnishing vault or are implementing a furnishing vault where they're going to be able to store some number of these in in their in the vault and clear up a whole crap ton of inventory space. So just lots of things like that. This is a question for you. Lay it on me and then it's going to be a question.

I really would love you to see the new opening area and the tutorial and how they they've redone this cuz I remember day one of what it really looked like and recently I have rerolled a character and I I think it's a great job. But uh Greg, I would love for you to be the most comfortable. So, we're going to stick with our normal characters and we'll find our way and we'll look north and we're just going to go straight to the map. We could cuz like I was thinking the the we have new people watching obviously hopefully they're excited they want to go play it.

But but but when I play Yes. I I do PvP a fair amount, but but I very much like the exploration also. So what I would do is go through the original tutorial, create a new character, and then go to Orsinium, which is my favorite place in the game, which again, it was the one zone that we had two years to make and and it just feels right. and it has some of the best quests in the game that aren't even the main story in that zone is great, but the some of the side quests are unbelievable.

And I think the biggest thing that players need to understand is you're never behind. So you can always play with whomever. So you can just come in and play whenever. Love that. But the biggest one is there is nothing you can do to your character that you can't undo later on easily. So just experiment and make choices and try something. If you want to pick up a destruction staff and shoot fireballs, go do that, right? If you want to sword and board it, you can do that. Like just just experiment and see what sticks with you because you can always undo it later on. If you want to pickpocket guards, you can do that. You can do that.
