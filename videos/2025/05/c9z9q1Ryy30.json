Let him host. Next to him is the master of hype snow Mike. Hi Tim or hi Greg. I was thinking about Tim because he's asking for things and it's like Tim never asks for things so you know it's a big deal if you ask. It is a big deal. Here's the deal Greg. The Gamecube controllers are now up for everybody to buy, but you not everybody. As the show goes live, Tim slacks the entire company. If I could get three people with NSO accounts to buy this for me and I'll Venmo you, that'd be hella sick. Yeah, cuz there limiting you. You can only buy one. You have an NSO account.

Today, we're brought to you by Subway Surfers and Factor. But we'll tell you about that later. For now, let's start with what is and forever will be topic of the showt.

Like that doesn't sound real. In the same way 2025 didn't sound real to us back in 2015. 100%. Yeah. Just stop there and think Ben will be 13. No, Ben will be 13 years old when the time capsules opened in 10 years. That's outrageous. That is outrageous. I'll be those are I'll be 52. Those are the years you hear about in sci-fi movies.

You were, Tim, and you led off with this one. And I got to talk first. So, I want to turn to you and say before I get to my many, many, many specific bullet points, what are your predictions and what will the video game industry be in 10 years? Oh, man, that's a big question. You asked me 10, you asked me 10 years ago, now I'm asking. I I think that it will still be thriving. I feel like there's obviously a lot of situations, many bumps, many big issues, many big hits.

So I think there'll be a lot of that type of stuff that you can't predict but um I I do think and this is going to be a theme of of my predictions going forward. I think that Nintendo is going to continue to remain dominant. Okay. And I think that the their level of domination is only going to increase. I like that. I'll stop there.

And what will the video game industry be like in 10 years? Man, Greg, what a great question. You know, from the consumer side of things, I would like to say a lot of the same, right? I'd like to think that we're all still playing a lot of great video games and enjoying some of the games that we love.

There's also a piece of me, Andy, that likes to think that maybe we are direct streaming to the TVs and not having a console anymore by the side. I think that's kind of farther in the future, but we can see we are going that direction, similar to how Netflix is now just as easy as a press of a button on your television, no matter what monitor screen you have.

That we are the the chasm between the low end and the high end is a lot closer than it's ever been in the history of games where yeah, you playing on a a handheld uh PC gaming device at this point is not nearly as good as playing on a high-end PC, but that difference is way closer than it was for a PSP to a PS3 or whatever any that we've ever seen in the",

Will someone else step in? Does it always have to be the big three? We were so hung up last time of Amazon and Activision. Are they going to enter the console market? I think now it's China, right?

Do you think you see PlayStation do that as well? Like I I you know I have the same questions we have here and I think at the top level we can all answer. I'm like will PlayStation exist? Will Xbox exist? Will Nintendo exist? I think yes across the board, right? Yeah. I think they could and probably will look dramatically different in the same way if we were to dial back 10 years ago what you're talking about. Xbox does not look like Xbox then, right?

I think they are primed for it. Like I think that we 10 years ago talking about the where we're at the Wii U and the 3DS.

But now with the hardware, like you said, right, it's getting better and others are pushing higher, but eventually we'll kind of get to a moment where everything is close.

I and understandably so because Oblivion was so radical for the time. Skyrim was so, oh my god, I can go to them all these different things. But like people just lose sight of what those games are, their DNA. And I don't see the DNA changing. For Elder Scrolls 6, I think Elder Scrolls 6 is going to be great. I think a lot of people are going to love it. I do not think it is this 10 out of 10 everybody",

And that well that will be the thing that people hold against them and ask them when is it going to be time to evolve and change because we'll have Crimson Desert out here maybe this year, next year.

Yeah.

You know, it's it's funny. Jordan in the chat said, uh the only game of this level with expectations that actually hit it was Final Fantasy 7 remake. And I do think that's an important thing to think about. Like there are certain games and properties that are just like oh it's impossible to actually live up to the hype and Final Fantasy 7 did. Um but you look at things where it's like you do reach a certain point whether it's Elder Scrolls 6 where it's like live up to the hype. I don't think it's literally possible for it to do that.

Plus, the game needs to be critically wellreceived and get perfect 10. Like, if it doesn't get perfect tens, it didn't live up to the hype. So, by definition, no. But I do think that in the reality of what we should possibly be expecting from a video game, I do think it's going to live up to it. GTA 6 lives up to the hype, says Greg Miller. Interesting. I think it nails it. I look at it a little bit differently. Does GTA Online live up to it? because it's not GTA 6 and what that means. It's the online factors you brought up, Tim.

And there's so much more that they can do in that sandbox and they've seen that from the RP servers. They've purchased teams that can do that kind of things. And now the question is, can that online live up to the hype that we want? That metaverse, that world we live in. Is this going to be what the fans want and expect? And I think that's where the question is. And and I think the answer to that is yes. Yes. I I think I think so, too.

The role playing people they've bought and all this, like I imagine Rockstar has to have been cooking and really working on getting GTA Online 2, for lack of a better term, to a place that maybe is going to have a rough launch and all the stuff, but I think you give that another decade of growing on that. you the the install base.

We will only see large ass patches where or not patches but large large ass expansions where your Destiny Guardian or your created character in GTA is the main character of the story similar to all of the side stories that you would see in GTA Online.

Like, I think that uh he's in such a unique position, too, where it's like he's getting the the acclaim and the have your cake and eat it too. It's like he can create these worlds and then present them in multiple forms of media. And I think that he has the golden ticket with HBO at this point. So yeah, I feel like he he wants to be a a creator. Like I I think that creating worlds and IP is of great value to him, but I think that all starts in games. I'm totally with you. I I think that you saying that he's got that game room, that's like the first thing that came to my mind as well. I think he's too into the challenge of making a fun interactive thing with really like resonant uh",

Um I mean even with that report of him working on a second game as well like that kind of caught me off guard at least. Um, yeah, I think he will still be super into wanting to continue game development, but also, yeah, T nailed it with have his cake and needed too. How can I push these mediums forward? And I kind of have, you know, all the permission in the world to also dive into other mediums now because they've seen what can happen. Greg, does he get a lure to go somewhere else? I think so. Uh, I don't know anything obviously. Uh, this is just [\u00a0__\u00a0] making it up as you go.

Not even not in a nefarious shitty way, but like PlayStation is paying you in paying Naughty Dog to pay you, right, to make this, but you're getting an opportunity to go direct this show, go make this movie, go do this thing. I think I could easily see it being Neil's like, I'm going to step away from Naughty Dog. I've loved my time here in the kennel with the dogs. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to make some weird [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm going to do some stuff that doesn't disqu qualify him from contributing to an independent project, making an independent game, doing something like that.

I could see him wanting even more freedom and wanting to make his own thing that isn't that's still game a game studio but no longer under the the watchful eye of of Sony up there.

Have we figured out how to use AI in a game that is in a way that isn't, oh god, I hate this and it's it's strip the soul out of everything. No. No. Like generative AI specifically. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If we're I mean, you're still going to have the people that are okay with it. I mean, there's plenty of people who feel like it's okay to do that.
