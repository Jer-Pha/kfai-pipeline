It's going okay. You know what I mean? Today started off bad. started uh Games Daily saying that everything's [\u00a0__\u00a0] and I feel like I willed that into existence for kind of funny as well. Uh both of our main kind of brain computers at the studio are having completely different issues. Uh so Kevin and Barrett are trying their damnedest to get everything up and running so we can keep doing the shows. We got cut off in the middle of episode one of Games Daily after story uh covering story number one which was all of the Xbox and Microsoft price increases. um that video slash audio versions everywhere should be where you expect them to be. We're going to continue the show from here with a part two of games daily because there is a lot of stuff that we want to make sure that we get to. I don't want to get into too much",

Quote, \"I'm no longer with Polygon. If you're hiring, please consider the many talented writers and editors now on the market.\" Posted Polygon co-founder in EIC, Chris Plant. Every one of them deserves a spot on your staff. I won't be t talking more about the sale because I wasn't involved. Going to hang out with my kid, taking wins where I can. The sales confirmed in a press release which did not mention the layoffs. The price of the deal was not disclosed.

I'm looking for work, as are so many of my amazing colleagues. I have lots of ideas and things I'd like to write. I'm really in shock. I had a great time working at Polygon, posted senior writer Michael Mcuarter. Please let me know if you have any cool job openings. In a report earlier this year by the RAP, many former contributors accused Valet's current media holdings of being exploitative content mills. Quote, \"In journalism, there are really bad jobs. And then there's a place like Valnet.\" A former Collider contributor told the rap, \"It's one of the worst places I've ever worked and it's probably one of the worst journalism publications I've ever seen.\" Let's just start",

Bless thoughts on Polygon. I mean, this is heartbreaking, right? Like, we've heard bad things about Valnet. We've I mean, we've heard bad things about the state of games media for a very long time. This is, I think, the moment where it does officially feel over, you know, like I think we say that a lot of like, oh man, it's over. Oh man, it's so done. Uh, today feels like a day where it's so done. Of course, like the giant bomb thing is also going on as we speak where uh I mean, it's been ongoing for the last week of what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is happening over there at Giant Bomb. Of course, I was in in Tokyo hanging out with Dan Riker for a week and so I've been going back and forth with even him talking about like, yo, what is happening? And he's been filling me in.

Uh well, that was a dream come true. Knew it wouldn't last though. out of the job uh out of a job at the moment, but I'll always be doing patreon.com/games. Um I think lumping these two together is a little bit necessary because yeah, I when I think of games media, the first website that comes to mind is IGN, but then like games content, games media, games podcast and all that stuff.

Like as much as I listen to kind of funny, I listen to just as much Giant Bomb coming up. Polygon all say the same thing as far as how much I listen to to uh Polygon podcasts and how formative that that stuff was as far as their humor, as far as their creativity, as far as the quality of content that they would bring to the table.

Nicole Carpenter as well, right? Like these are just a handful of names. There are other people posting online talking about them being out of the job, right? I saw a post from Cali PGY uh just earlier as well talkingh talking about it. Like this is so [\u00a0__\u00a0] heartbreaking. Um and there are a million a million things to say about this, right?

That's not the case for everybody. The unfortunate thing is that to be as renowned as those names that I just said is such a blessing and a rare thing uh in this side of the industry. Most people don't have that luxury. And that is the truly heartbreaking thing about this is the fact that like once a lot of these sites are gone, that stuff is just gone, right?

It heartbreaking, man. It's a great way to put it. And I I think you really nailed it for the how important Polygon and Giant Bomb are to the gaming media landscape for incredibly different reasons, but it's so sad to just one by one look at so many sites go down. And incredibly important voices be lost. And in terms of Polygon putting out such thought-provoking journalism and thoughtprovoking think pieces, handling games differently than anyone else",

Like thinking back in the day to the the OneUp uh podcast and all that, like they defined what video game personality podcast could be. And then, you know, here's kind of funny, right? We're so lucky being able to grow up in a a world where um a standard was kind of set in the early days of what even a premium uh video game media video based website could look like, right?

And these acquisitions for Polygon letting go of Polygon, like pretty the entire team essentially. Like I'm seeing a super chat here from Zeke speak saying, \"Y'all should get Tara Long on as a guest. She was laid off this morning. Legacy figure. I used to watch her in Scoville back in the day on Destructoid.\" That breaks my heart, man. Tara's one of the the first people I ever met in the industry. like when I would go to PAX in 2011, uh I remember hanging out with her so much and to see the journey that she's been on from Destructor and all the way up to uh running video I think it was at at Polygon and the amazing stuff that they would put out like this just really really sucks.

Yeah, like they were just straight up disrespected. Disrespected, you know, and I these are very different stories, but I think the thing they have in common is is uh terrible parent organizations. Like you look at uh uh Giant Bomb, right? And like one of the So they they had 888 episodes of the Giant Bomb cast and like keep in mind that's a weekly podcast. Think about the longevity there as far as 888 episodes. You've been going for that long as a company.

No more live streams. No more live streams. Like we wouldn't be able to exist as a company. Like that's the totally totally antithesis of what this is.

Thrive is even a big word, but like again, survive uh in this world. And it's like being kneecapped and told that, hey, like your live streaming efforts, which are clearly where this industry is currently and where the audience is, like to take that away from Giant Bomb, you're killing Giant Bomb. And the the people that work at Giant Bomb know that because they're trying their best to just make this stuff work.

She also ordered Apple to stop prompting messages dissuading users from using WebLink purchases and ordered Apple to pay Epic Games attorney fees over the issue.
