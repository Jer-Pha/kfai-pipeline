There will be an easier difficulty below it and then they will go even more extreme if you want more of a challenge of the world. Well, for the challenge runners honestly cuz like I think the game's plenty hard as it is. But for the challenge runners, I think there's been such an awesome uh the true sickos out there. There's been a really awesome economy with like a lot of great speedrunners who play through a lot of bosses. Uh this is one of the um first bosses that you will encounter in the zoo.

I started off in group one where it's like you you just do the boss rushes. You play up to three bosses with five difficulty levels. You start, you know, it starts off at three and then you can, you know, maybe you want to see all the bosses, drop it to difficulty two, maybe down to one or whatever. I I didn't do that cuz I just I I lost track of time. And then by the time you were lost in the sauce as I was beating. How long did you have with it? Uh 1 hour on each side.

Now, if you run a bit more, it sort of like speeds up and becomes a number four and gets stronger. It It rocked. The weapon choices are great. I wish we had more time with the exploration section of it cuz I think the thing one of the things that really sets Liza P apart from a lot of other Souls likes uh is not only that it it's real good but it uh the weapon experimentation because so much of Liza P is well I love the handle on this weapon and I love the stats but the blade isn't really what I'm looking for. let me disassemble this other weapon, take that blade, put it on this, and you you kind of like have a a lot of player agency",
