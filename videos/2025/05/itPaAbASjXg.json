Yeah, absolutely. Barrett, what did you think of these? Yeah, I was uh in a similar spot at the end of last week where it's like I I would I could hang on to the end of the first three episodes for an entire season. I was a bit worried about how they were going to handle the storytelling aspect of jumping from year to year.

Oh, no. And like all of this kind of like undercover stuff where he weirdly becomes like inverse Andor in this uh trio of episodes, which I thought was really cool. And I think the way that they kind of lay that all out uh and spread that all out is very very well done and adds like a kind of new layer of tension because the roller coaster I went on with Cirill especially in that first episode was like I it was hard for me to process. I was like, \"Oh my god, serial uh you know, kind of, you know, waking up and being a comrade. Let's [\u00a0__\u00a0] go.\" And be like, \"Oh no.\" And then be like, \"Maybe at one point.

Uh, and then yeah, the tension is just so it's so thick between all of the different levels of action that you're getting. The butthole was clenched, Tim, in the last like 10 minutes of episode three of like all of these different stakes being thrown in. And it just reminded me of, you know, uh there's the famous kind of Red Letter Media video breaking down uh Phantom Menace and, you know, George Lucas being like, \"Ah, it's three planes of action.

It's it's they continue to absolutely kill it this team and uh yeah I'm excited to talk all about it. Yeah, I I continue to be supremely impressed by uh how they are structuring this show and how the three episodes being a year I think really adds to everything.

Um, I think just like anchors everything in a way that makes it uh easy to follow and you were saying this, but like kind of read between the lines of episodes 1 through three and then four through six of like you can put together how we got here from there. And um I like that. I feel like there's that imagination kind of like helps a lot fleshing out these characters, but they also just do such a great job of I think peeking into little story beats enough to get us where we need to go. I think Saw Guerrera is a great example of that. Like Saw is a character that I feel and Will was Will, oh my god, amazing in this episode or in this series, right?

Um and uh the giving the backstory to his breathing situation and it being essentially he does it to himself like that's yeah and someone who watches the or watched the Clone Wars like I even had a bigger disconnect cuz it was really just like how do you go from this kid to where Saw is at in Rogue One? And I think like this episode uh or this moment he has with Will.

Um, that I think works a bit more for me.\" Yeah, for sure. And, you know, his group kind of being like the the these radicals.

Like I am very very into it. My big thing though is I feel like these episodes uh I didn't enjoy them as much as the first three and I think it's because of a severe lack of Mon Mothma. I just love her and I just want more of her and what we got from her here was utterly fantastic. U but I want more and I beggars can't be choosers. It's fine. I will will be okay with it because we got a lot more of Clea. Is that her name? Yes. And I adore her and getting more of Bix and Bix's relationship with Andor. Great stuff.

Thank you.\" And and I understand that we did heavily frontload with Monothma in the first three. Uh and I did feel like, you know, we had talked about it being really light on Cassian's actual story in the first three. So, I think we're kind of shifting that and letting him take a little more of a point of it. I definitely had a moment when he was taking off to go and pose as a fashion designer that I was like, there's no way anyone is believing that this man is a fashion designer. like nothing about his vibe is giving high fashion. Then he put the outfit on and I was like, I believe I'm coming around. And the way he talks to like the bellboy so bad.

I love too the uh the way that we're seeing the rebellion start to form and there's a language and secrets that that they the different groups understand like I I forget exactly the words but uh they're like are are you traveling to see friends or something like that and like that's kind of like their their opener uh that no matter what planet you're on saying that kind of keys into people that like oh we're we're part of the same team here like that stuff was",

Um, but I think the thing that I I take away the most from these three episodes is the word revolutionary because everybody in these different groups, as we're cutting back and forth between even more people now and more stories, uh, are their different ideas of revolution. And I wrote down two lines that I think were incredibly important and came up in I believe the same episode. I think they were both in six. Um, the man who's speaking to him, what is his name? um from Gorman, the one um who's like a rebel on Gorman says to Cassian, \"Not much of a rebel or not much of Yeah. Uh he says, \"Not much of a revolutionary, are you?\" In that like",

Because they're thinking about their home and their immediate things of it. And Cassian is thinking about like the bigger picture of it all. But that line comes up a second time when Sawerrera says, \"Revolution is not for the same.\" Yeah. Um, and I think that was like to me exactly what these three episodes were is like what is your idea of revolution and how far are you willing to go for it? What will you sacrifice? Who will you sacrifice? Um, and what's too far? Because like obviously we know what like everything we know about Sawerrera is everybody's like he went too far. He went too far. He went too far.

Like somebody has to be the bad guy in the revolution that goes too far so that all of the other people can come out unscathed as good guys that didn't go too far. But like if everybody if everybody plays it safe like that, revolution doesn't happen. um and people aren't protected and they don't you know um see big change and we know what happens obviously like with Gorman on that side of it and we see uh people whose idea of revolution fails right um obviously in losing Cinta it's like you've had the chance to see the big picture your idea is your home you didn't even know what sacrifices that you were making and you will pay for it for the rest of your life because you didn't have the information you",

I mean, I thought it was going to be the red flags were all Vel. Especially with like man asking about asking Luan at the party. She's like like I haven't seen my cousin.

In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith, accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams. Each cardoggram affects which enemies, boss fights, and loot will appear when you enter the monolith, so no two excursions will be the same. Find even more cardiggrams to explore by looting defeated enemies, or buy them from other players online at the trading post.

This is part of his plan. Luan thinks through everything and considers everything. There's no way that he thought he could come and speak to you and I wouldn't know about it. He saw the state that Bix was and saw that like if this continues as if something doesn't happen, Bix is gone. And if Bix is gone, there's also the possibility Cassian is gone.

Uh something we haven't depends sorry do we see it depends on if they want to show us him making that relationship with K2SO because if you do it in the last week then we don't get to see the build of the relationship between him and K2 which could happen cuz like we've seen so much of it in Rogue One. We see their we get a pretty good idea of their love and their relationship, but I'm curious if they want to show us the forging of that. Yeah. Interesting. Interesting.

It's because he saw Bix's face and all this stuff. Um, he's very protective of things right now. And so, I'm interested to see when, if and when he's ready to lose it all. I'm not saying I want this.

Like it's a good reminder of that of like you just want things to go back to normal under the guise of the Empire and you think the Emperor's good. Okay, that's fascinating.
