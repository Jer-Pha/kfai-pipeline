We have all this and more because this is kind of funny games [Music] daily. Yo, what's up? Welcome to Count of Funny Games Daily for Monday, April 5th, 2025, May 5th, 2025. I'm one your host, Blessing Addio Jr. Joining me is WWE legend Greg Miller. What do you want to talk about, Bless? What do you want to talk about? Maybe Game Showdown season 3's finale on Friday. Just like the whole Thunderbolts thing, the embargo's up. All right, we don't have to hide it anymore. I won. I'm the champion. I have the belt and all is right in the world once again. Was there a whole Thunderbolts embargo thing? I thought there was. Yeah, today they've Have you seen Thunderbolts? Yes. Okay.

So, if you haven't seen Thunderbolt, I don't know how I feel. You got to give me one more time. No, it's cool. about game showdown. I mean, first off, it did really well at the box off and now probably will do even better when people are like, \"What the [\u00a0__\u00a0] happening?\" Wow. Wow. Um, you got the belt over your shoulder. You got the blue suit on, which you do look great in. Thank you. Of course, I am threetime threep. Come on, champions. And I won the championship this season.

Uh the super chat question uh for the story is, is this the right move for Gears of War? Let us know in the super chats. Uh the Xbox Wire post reads like this. Gears of War Reloaded is a celebration of one of gaming's most iconic franchises. Featuring 4K resolution, 120 FPS support and the ultimate multiplayer experience with cross progression and crossplay across all platforms, this is the definitive way to experience the game that started it all.

That's $39.99 on Xbox Series X and Xbox PC, Xbox Cloud Gaming, PS5, and Steam. And arrives on day one with Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. With crossplay across all platforms, you and your friends can squat up no matter where you play. No Microsoft account required. However, signing in with a Microsoft account unlocks full cross-platform functionality. Ah, there it is.

Are you excited about this? Is this something that speaks to you? No. Uh, it doesn't not speak to me. It's just like I was never a Gears guy. It's a very cool move to have it jump over. I'm more of And I see the chat was popping off with it, too. Why isn't it also two and three? Uh, you know, at first glance when we jumped in and we started talking about Gears of War Reloaded, I I assumed it was going to be all three of them just bundled together. Like, here it is, you know, the one definitive place to get it. Not that it's just Gears of War again, which is fine. And I'm not taking away from what Gears of War and the achievement it was",

Uh but an interesting one that it's not all of them. Granted, of course, you could sell the other two later on, but do you think this comes back to how much work they're putting into it? Maybe it's it's a thing of, hey, we putting so much into this remaster that we think that we can sell as an individual thing to come around to two and three. One of the things that shocked me about this is the fact that this didn't come out with a trailer so we can actually like see how it looks in motion. Yeah. like we have uh Barrett pulled it up earlier, but on the Xbox Wire post there are a couple of screenshots that show the uh 4K versus the original resolutions and you look at the image and it's like, \"Oh, this looks great.",

Obviously, we're reading the final Kab says in the super chat. So, is it a remake, a remaster? Is is it a remake or a remaster of a remaster? Is it a remaster? Like cuz that's what I'm looking at with the second screenshot there, right? The first one is Gears of War, the second one is whatever they called the remaster of that, and then the one here now, Gears were reloaded. And like if I'm squinting my eyes, I'm like, Gears Reloaded looks really good. Yeah, it looks really, really good. I'd love to see it in motion like you're saying. Yeah, 100%.

You got 4K resolution, you got 60 fps in campaign, 120 fps in multiplayer, you got HDR, you got the Dolby stuff, you got VRR, 4K assets. Like 4K assets actually is the thing that jumps out at me there where that is all you're you're now putting in a lot of work into this. Yeah, good for y'all.

They're they're saying the thing and walking the walk, right, of like, you know, gaming is better when it's everywhere and we want to be supportive of everything.

Uh, even Wagger Man here in the super chat says it's the right move. Not sure why people are upset. Are people upset? Cuz I'm not I've not seen the upset. Are Xbox gamers missing out on anything? No. More sales mean more games like this? Excited? I think it's the usual amount of fanboy tribalism, right, where people are upset to see, oh my god, the exclusives are going to somewhere else.

What what are we going to get from that? Again, I think it's interesting. You know, last week we talked about Xbox raising their prices, right? And it was what pretty much a month to the day, which I guess isn't correct because we're talking about Switch, but a month and a few days to their big press conference, right? So, it is they're clearing out the here's the bad news, here's news that's exciting, but we don't want to spend that much time on it. And again, maybe this gets Gears of War a good boost of energy, a good boost of goodwill. And then you go in there and you talk about Eay uh during the Xbox Direct at SGF or XGF weekend. Yeah.

When are we going to accept that Xbox is just a third party pub? Uh, they are only Xbox Game Studios and Xbox Game Pass. We don't make a big deal about EA or Ubisoft or Sega. Xbox have tapped out uh the typical Sony and Nintendo way. Is they've tapped out that way, but they're still making the hardware. They are still making hardware. There will still be a next generation Xbox. There's apparently going to be an Xbox handheld. That again is a different fight. They're fighting this war in a different way than PlayStation is.

I think like the war as far as the war, right, for me and when I look at it, the war seems over at least between Xbox and PlayStation directly, right? But like, yeah, there's still so much to it as far as what you want to build as Xbox and how things uh still need to play together and how there still needs to be a strategy that is way different from what an EA does and way different from what an act, I guess, Activision.

Yeah. And so even PlayStation, Xbox going back and forth, I think, as Xbox breaks away into this service model into showing you what Game Pass and Cloud and Game Anywhere can be is far different than what PlayStation's doing. what PlayStation's also sitting there going like, \"Well, look at this library of first party we we have that nobody's been able to touch no matter how hard they try.\" Uh, Bar, what were we going to say?",
