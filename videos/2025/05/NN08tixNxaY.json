I'm a fan of them working on multiple projects because last and we were just talking a couple days ago, maybe it was yesterday, just about the generations and PS4 going to PS5 and how generations mean less than they ever did because the games are what matters and always have and we're kind of just seeing all the biggest games on PS5 mostly being games that are also playable on PS4. But at a certain point, I think that might end up changing once we get to Sony Santa Monica's next game, potentially multiple new Naughty Dog, whether it's the big IP of um uh Intergalactic um or the Heretic Prophecy or whatever this other thing is.

You think this new IP is a PS5 game, too? Yeah, I do. Um, I also think that it's probably a PS6 game as well. The same we're talking about Miles Morale. Um, yeah, it is.

Um, so yeah, I I do feel like Last of Us 3 is inevitable. um on the not sooner side necessarily like next year but like within the next couple years like I would not be shocked if a Last of Us 3 is playable on a PlayStation 5. Interesting. I don't think it's a guarantee. Wow. I don't think it's a guarantee but I guess it's not. I go wow and then I'm like well again with how their work generations work now that doesn't sound as crazy.

And I think that an Uncharted game made by uh a director that Neil gets to be a bit more of a mentor over and the executive in the room. That could make a lot of sense, right?

But Donkey Kong being the month after that, it kind of gives that like second jump on points. Um it allows people to have a little bit more time to either save up money to buy the game because they just spent $80 in Mario Kart World or um just continue to have new jump on points for the Switch 2 as we go on throughout the year. And a lot of them are double dipping, triple dipping it back into Nintendo's catalog. But they've always done that and Nintendo's proven time and time again that people are willing to go back and pay again for a game that they loved.

And I do think that they're going to continue to sell this thing out. My question is, is it going to be Wii Satis sold out, impossible to get where it's like kind of bad? Because this is the time for Nintendo to get these things in households. you know, if they can get 20 million in the first year, that is like such a nice base to be able to count on uh and having the the adoption rates of games and they've continued to show that they have that and every generation's gotten",

Like, I honestly believe that if Nintendo just makes enough right moves in a row, and I don't think this they're that far off from accomplishing this, I think the Switch 2 is going to undeniably win this console generation from whatever metric that actually matters. Uh, and I think that it it has the potential to redefine what video games are to the majority of people playing video games.

Sag after slaps Fortnite with unfair labor practice complaint over James Earl Jones's AI recreated voice of Darth Vader. This is Todd Spangler over at Variety.

As such, SAG After filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board against Llama Productions. Jones, who died in 2024 at age 93, had signed off an agreement to allow his archival voice recordings to be used to recreate his younger voice from Star Wars films for future Lucasfilm projects. In addition, Jones's family had granted permission for the use of his voice in Fortnite.
