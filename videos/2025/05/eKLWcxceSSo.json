Doom Eternal a little bit of a step back for me even though it is a step forward in a lot of ways. Uh it just got a little too complicated with the gameplay.

So, going going into Doom: The Dark Ages and stripping all of that back and focusing on the uh on the ground Doom Slayer running around and just parrying things and with the shield, it just it feels heavier. It feels better and it also feels way more streamlined. I'm interested to see what the rest of the Doom community is going to think, especially the Doom Eternal people, because it feels like a step back a little bit because there is no double jump, there is no dash, there is uh a focus on uh streamlining these systems specifically when it comes to your health and your ammo. Uh you know, you are able to get health and ammo pretty frequently in this game. Uh you don't really have to deal with, you know, the chainsaw or different uh elements. you can just kind of go in",

This is my probably the best out of the three in terms of like the gameplay and the way that it feels. And this is my perfect middle ground. I don't love the story though. The story is like the big negative uh that is keeping that from an amazing score. But uh if I were to give a score right now, I would say it's an 85. really great blessing you're a junior for this I there's a comparison I want to make that's gonna be a little bit wacky but stick with me right like I'll stick with you big dump you know if you know me you know I grew up in Illinois and I remember like my",

They have like a um an R3 run, which I believe is new for this game. I don't remember that being in Doom, right? It was not in Doom Eternal. Exactly.

I feel like they streamlined it a lot more. And I think the thing that they've done with this is they've made it more welcoming to a more casual audience to someone that isn't familiar with Doom. It so you can kind of ease your way in because I love how you can customize the difficulty in this depending on what it is that you're trying to do. So I just played this on just a standard difficulty. I didn't I didn't tweak or modify anything beyond that. Oh, and I played this on PC and I actually have no idea how long it took me. I would guess anywhere between 15 to 17 hours, something like that. Um, I really enjoyed it. I really did. I I I felt this being more grounded and and like you're saying, Doomslayer is",

I wanted to get a bunch of cool guns, get that freaking shield and just slay demons. And that's what I got to do in it. Um, I enjoyed the music in it as well. I think from a visual standpoint, it it looks fantastic on IDTech 8. They really did their thing when it ca came to that. This was a lot of fun to me. The story was the story. Honestly, I'm just killing stuff. It It didn't really matter to me about the story, but um I really liked it. I'm I'm gonna go score a little bit higher than than the other two.

And I also think there's replayability in this, believe it or not, because there's all the secret areas and things that you can go back and try and get because when you do get to the end of a chapter, it gives you the percentage of everything that you've done in that chapter. So, that does compel me to want to go back and see if I can 100% everything. Not to mention all the difficulty stuff. So, you can ramp up the difficulty in this. And I'm sure we'll get into that as we talk about this more. But, I I can't even imagine what nightmare difficulty is like on this thing. So, I definitely want to go back and check that out, too.

At least in my opinion that's how I felt. I never felt like any one section kind of dragged on too long. Um, I enjoyed all the weapons.

And also the level of destruction that you're having on enemies cuz they I think they introduced this quite a bit in Doom Eternal as far as how Yeah. how enemies will degrade as you're shooting them down.

Um I guess I guess I never looked at it from Roger's point of view. I was like, do I want to replay this on the Spotify playlist? I never thought about that. But I thought in the moment as as I'm going through the game, some of the beats really kept me engaged at, you know, as I'm in these battles. But the transition from that, you know, to quieter moments, I I think you're kind of spot on about that. They could have been a little better.

I thought the same thing when I did the preview. whenever you see a bunch of enemies out in the distance. And a cool mechanic in uh this game is obviously you have your sick ass shield.

Everything else I was putting into weapons. Captain America vibes right there. I I love again because of the amount of enemies they throw into a lot of the combat encounters.

Also, I want to um bring in another super chat from Rain and Bishop real quick who says, \"Do you miss glory kills? Do you like the new execution system?\" Also, what's up, Paris? Um, real quick, I think I do miss the glory kills. I That was one of the things that I when we first saw the trailers, right, it was like the um you kind of go in and melee them to death as opposed to like go in, snap their neck, right? Like take their arm, [\u00a0__\u00a0] shame to their thing, right? Doom 2016 and I had to like double check this cuz I booted up again. Um like most of the kills even for the fodder enemies were like they had animations to them and I kind of miss those animations. I kind of get why they take them out because there's just a lot more enemies to kill uh this time around. I think there's a lot more going on but I think it would break up",

I think there's a lot more going on but I think it would break up the combat a lot. So I don't mind them being gone. But I did like that if you if you jump up in the air a different animation will happen. And that is I I think that made that was enough variety for me cuz I think early on I had the same thought of like oh man, you know, the glory kills got really violent and kind of cool and creative. But then I think after about 4 hours like I'm just seeing the same ones all over again. I don't I it is kind of like breaking up the momentum. I want to see Happy Medium cuz they do have him when you are facing off against like a powered up enemy like that. Like if you kill this enemy you your maximum ammo gets increased and usually those I wish those were like a nemesis system. Yeah.

Oh my god, that's a call I kept on thinking about cuz they were named enemies. They were the ones on the map that all right, this is like a special lead. They called like leader enemies. They're the leader of this whole crew. You have to kill all of the sort of mini bosses to then be able to face that leader while it's still attacking you. You can't attack. You're also after you kill all the mini bosses, more mini bosses spawn and you have to kill that person. It's crazy. And when you do that, you you like reach into their chest and grab their heart and then like I kept on wanting him to eat it. I kept on wanting to take a bite of the heart. But I I wish there was a bit more a bit more animations. I understand why there's not an animation for every enemy cuz I I think that does get a bit repetitive.

Like it is go in, snap neck, go in, snap neck, right? Like they are fairly quick. I would have liked to see just a little bit more. Um, I have another super chat from Ghostly Icon who says, \"Xcast, baby. Off topic. They should really remake Skyrim. Release it a year before Elder Scroll 6.\" And no, Andy, I'm not doing mobs. Have no time for that [\u00a0__\u00a0] I need a real release. Mobs. Yeah, Andy. What do you mean moss? Stop talking [\u00a0__\u00a0] about the mobs. Yeah, moaf old mods maybe. Oh.

Um, and I I just also wanted to shout out the art team cuz every every detail and corner of this world is just so perfectly art directed. There's so many little things that you will see for two seconds. It reminds you of like watching a a a Studio Ghibli movie. Yeah.
