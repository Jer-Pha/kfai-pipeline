Future Days, we knew Future Days was coming. We knew the museum scene with the spaceship was coming, right? Like there's so much that we expected them to tackle here. I think the way they weaved it all together did so much justice to how to I guess supporting Ellie's journey earlier in this season, right? Like I think one of the bumpy things this season for me has been buying into Ellie's revenge mission of like really believing that like she's all the way in, right? She's bloodthirsty. She's like where she's at in the video game. And I think part of the um reason you have these moments that are these flashback moments that are um help filling in that",

And they do such a good job of taking us through the years of where Ellie was at at the end of last one is he called um and then getting us yearbyear to all right this is where we're at with Ellie. She's celebrating her birthday museum scene. All right, year later, she's starting to get a little bit rebellious as a teenager. And then like having it build into Ellie as she gets older becomes a bit more curious and becomes a bit more, yo, what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is really going on here? Like I'm starting to have mistrust to this person that is my caretaker, which I think is accurate to like a lot of teenagers and how a lot of us might, you know, grow with in that relationship with our parents.

Like I think building that all together in this way was so well done to where I truly believe like the tension that they built here as far as why Ellie is upset with Joel, how Ellie got here with with that, but then also why Joel is doing what he's doing. Like I I think they did it really well. Yeah, Nick. Uh, this is my favorite episode so far of this season.

Uh, and in my brain I'm like, man, I wish I could go back and play part two, but with all those moments that weren't like hardcore game mechanics of stealth and like having to kill people. Just sub this in just cut to live action like it's a 1990s game and we just I just watch this scene cuz it was so good and they did so good in this and that that final scene with Joel and like I mean we got to talk about Joey P.

And I think this episode's the best example of that. Everything that they did one for one, I thought they nailed. and everything that they added I think really really really uh was earned and I think strengthens the story of Last of Us 2 in a lot of ways that some of the choices so far are a little more questionable of like all right this is different we'll see where it pays off I think that a lot of the choices they've made in this episode paid off and the I think dualsided thing of getting the storyline in starting the 80s with Tony Dalton who's like a badass I love this guy anytime he shows up I freaking love him.

And I do think that it's way on the nose, but I think it works for the type of story that this is telling here where um having uh Joel's dad and Tommy's dad have that line of just like I hope that you just do a little bit better than me and then having Joel obviously at the end do that to Ellie. I just think it just tightens up their characters even more than the the games do. And on top of that, having the whole Eugene storyline and having Ellie make him promise that he's going to take uh Eugene back to uh say goodbye to his wife and then obviously we see what goes down with that.

Um that stuff to me I think oh this is better than the game. like this strengthens these choices and decisions and Ellie being so mad at Joel. All of it, her seeing it for herself and discovering it herself, I think just makes it a lot better. Adding on top of that, the him having the line about like, I hope that if you have a kid, knowing she does have a kid, you know, and the decisions that she makes later, it's like it's rough. It it really I think enhances the tragedy of Ellie's storyline. Um, but I also think it puts such a a beautiful bow on Joel Miller. And uh I think that this is one of the rare cases where the show took an incredibly important poignant scene from the games and did it even better. Like I think that the the patio scene",

And I think it's also the placement of the story changes it. Like this being the one of the last things, if not the last dialogue we get in the actual video game, is the, you know, I don't think I could ever forgive you, but I'd like to try. Like, god, that hits so hard. And that's the end of the game, which I think is great for the context of that story. But the way they're telling this version of the story, I think having it here being this like actual goodbye to Joel is something that I think that we've all kind of wanted a little bit from Ellie's journey here and the episode ending like pretty much right after last week of her killing Nora",

That's crazy man. She's about to [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] up. Yeah. I love I mean I love that too because the entire time you're waiting right obviously this whole episode's been done in flashbacks the entire time you're waiting for that shot and you know it's coming the shot of her in the rain looking like a [\u00a0__\u00a0] just a murderer walking back to the theater and we get it toward the very very end there and it's uh it's very powerful stuff.

Putting them all together with this added context I think was a very wise call. Yeah, I like it too cuz I I I think it being we're toward the end of season 2 and knowing that we're going to have to wait for a season 3. So many of the stuff they touch on in the flashbacks I think are very important to Ellie's character where she's at right now, right? I I think they're doing a good job in season two of arcing this around Ellie and we kind of know that season three, at least I don't know if we know season 3 is going to be about Abby, right?

Imagine I don't I've not seen the next up on yet, but like I imagine next episode is going to be [\u00a0__\u00a0] violent, right? I imagine it's going to be Ellie continuing that journey and getting to somewhere of an apex of that story. And with that being the case, I think having the flashbacks be the thing to kind of build up that tension of, oh, now I understand where Ellie's where Ellie's at fully. like we understood before, but now I think having the audience understand that last interaction with Joel puts us in a place of, oh, okay, so this is what she's fresh off of, and",

And seeing this, I'm like, yes, I'm going I need to know what's going on in in the seventh episode. I think this was a a perfectly placed moment to get all that backstory out.

But, uh, the show fleshing it out with the therapist, Katherine O'Hara, being his wife, and we get in the early episodes, the kind of setup that she has beef with Joel because of how he killed her husband.

And she's like, \"Well,\" and then she has a great line, too, which like it's not an experiment. Like, this is basically who I am. And I there's another another fun line I liked in there too is like you know him looking at the other girl being like like really like 17 and she's like I'm 19, right? Like you know there is this almost like um rebellious nature coming from Joel because he is just trying to have he's trying to hold on to a thing that he's losing and I think it's kind of double back to the fact that he has lost a child before.
