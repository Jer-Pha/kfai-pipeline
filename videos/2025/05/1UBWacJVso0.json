I sure if I were This is one of those characters that I look at I'm like if I were you uh uh part of your team, I would have left you behind a long time ago because you're making some poor choices and you're doing some really heinous [\u00a0__\u00a0] But I think that's the whole point.

I'm going to have to decompress I guess to figure out why that's the feeling of it. But I don't have the feeling of season 1 where I was like they [\u00a0__\u00a0] nailed this. They crushed this. It's not that this is bad, but I think it's probably part because this isn't a full story. Maybe that's there too. Some of the choices they made here I appreciated in terms of like the little stuff of giving us more Jesse, giving him more information. It's an interesting choice to have Ellie open up to Dena and tell her way more way earlier. But then there's stuff to, you know, Nick's point here of like, are you an Ellie fan here? Are you back?

Then gets knocked out of the boat, washes up on Sarafi Island, which I feel like is a lot further down all the way over there in the pitch black. Gets into a two second jam there.

So, it's even more like, but would you do that here? You wouldn't stop being the water and the thing. And yeah, I'm with you. I think that I think there is a there is a limit to when you're watching an actual human being Yeah. act and you're seeing the like the more reality. I don't want to say that the video game doesn't create a great reality because it absolutely does, but there's a difference in how you're experiencing when you're playing through it.

Let's just let's go. Let's let's let's go home after this.\" Actually, probably when when my friend said that she was pregnant and I was putting her life in danger, I'd be like, \"Maybe we we rethink this, right?\" And then we get that conversation at the end where where Jesse's sort of like, \"Hey, you know, I know you'd move heaven and earth for me.\" I'm like, \"She just proved she wouldn't. She literally just proved that she would leave Tommy behind. Tommy, her surrogate uncle, to go do this thing that doesn't even need to be done.\" And so after a certain point after decision",

I really don't. I really don't. And then we switch over to Abby and I'm like yes that's the world I want to be in now. What about you from a top level? It's it's a tough one for me where I'm kind of with you guys in the sense that like it being over I'm not like thrilled. Uh I I I wish we were getting I'm different than Nick that I wish we were getting more right now. Um, but I also just feel like at the end of the day, this being seven episodes, now that we've seen all the changes they made, most of which I was in support of and still am in support of, I do feel we were kind of robbed of an extended look at Ellie's time in Seattle.

Um, and to get to where we we are uh in the story here, like meeting back at the the theater and stuff, like I am reminded of how much I preferred the Abbeby story in the game. Um, whereas the Ellie stuff was just there was so much mystery. And it's it's once you know the story of this game, it's hard to go back to seeing Ellie stuff. And I think it's uh interesting because not too much happens with Ellie. And I think that's evidenced in the show covering the major beats and not that much happening, right? But I think that it's not until we get the context of who Owen is in Aby's thing that his death matters at all.

But I think the show did a good job of the Ellie not being bloodthirsty enough or whatever. I don't agree with that personally. Like I feel like her the extents to which she is throwing herself at this problem. I think they show in the show a a very good version of Ellie doing that and just going way too far. And I'm with you, Nick, of like I'm not in support of this Ellie, but I felt that way in the game, too. But I feel like with the show, I'm an extra not. And I feel like seeing Jesse and them walk in and dealing with the pregnancy bit more, like dealing with her not being able to save the baby and Mel like begging her to and seeing",

I thought that stuff really, really, really hit. It's just I think the biggest problem that I have with this season and this episode in particular is the fact that we have to wait so long for a season 3 and to get Aby's story and then potentially even a season 4 to move on from the moment we're at at the end of this potentially. And I think that while I can deal with that, I don't think the majority of people can. And I think that's going to be really to the detriment of the overall experience of the show and how people think about it and talk about it. Last of Us 2 the game was incredibly divisive and controversial for people that were able to play through the entire story in one sitting. Uh breaking it up this way I think is going",

I thought that while I still feel like she should be buff and I don't like that change in the story, I think that she is so imposing and the the shot of her walking out into the arena, I'm like the way she's acting, her final speech in the theater, I'm like that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] Abby. Yeah. Yeah, 100%. Yeah, they crush that a lot too. I think to your point of the bloodthirsty Ellie and and her throwing at it, I think it's the idea that when we were playing it and I was like, \"No, no, no, no, don't do this, Ellie. Don't do this, Ellie.\" I felt like even outside of the moments of going for revenge, it weighed on her and it felt like it was on top of her shoulders the entire time and she wasn't the Ellie we knew from",

My counterpoint here in season two, right, with Bella Ramsey, who I think does a great job of interpreting this character and working with what she has is that Ellie is still very Ellie at time. Like she's still very wise, cracky, she's enjoying life, but then she remembers that she's mad or she has to go and then so it's just like there's two tones there that I think in the game there was one tone and then a lot of melancholy that surrounded that. And that then that's for me the disconnect of I just don't buy what Bella Ramsay's been giving us and then looking at the pitch black ocean in the middle of a [\u00a0__\u00a0] crazy ass thunderstorm gigantic [\u00a0__\u00a0] waves getting watch.

I need to go back and have it, you know, change. They've changed so much so many little things. I wonder how they I would have liked to have seen them massage this. I feel I would agree with what you're saying, but to me the turning point was a couple episodes ago when they're in the little Sarapite forest and she ditches Jesse and Dena after like she had now reunited with with the squad. I feel like that was the turn the point of no return of just like, oh, she's gone from this. Like she is gone. She is going to finish this mission if it means she succeeds or dies. And I think that her throwing herself into the scariest freaking ocean in the world, like that's proof of that of she's gone, you know?

And it wasn't until we get the contextualization of the Abby side of it that you start to really I personally be like, \"Oh man, like I'm seeing Ellie from a completely different perspective.\" Whereas playing as Ellie, it's just like this how video games work, you know? Yeah. Yeah. And I think that I think a lot of that again you're not in the story so long, right? You are there are those moments where you're traversing. There's the boat moments.

I don't know. I mean cuz like like you know jumping into that conversation because we're here. It's like I I feel like at the very least it gets up to the theater moment, right?

So, for Ellie to get in the boat, then get put into a title wave or just a gigantic wave, right?

They all got washed up right over there to where she signed up to where there was one kid who immediately found her, who immediately brought her in, who immediately put her in the news, who immediately had the explosion, who immediately just left. And it's just like, this is all way too convenient. And then she gets back on the boat and goes, and then we're into a place where it's like, it's not. But I'm like, okay, this could have been the same footage of her on the boat again, like doing it. Like I understand the point here is her motivation to get there and how we how I want her to be.

I'd be like I mean kill her. Exactly right. Why? Like what am I doing? Like is she not one of the invaders we're thinking is doing? She's not one of us. So by definition she's an enemy.

I was like yeah I just I missed the how set up far away it was. I really like story-wise of this. And again, I think this is all going to be stuff that is better when we get the second half of this story and being able to see how it interwines with the interweavves with the Abbeby story cuz I do feel like the Ellie part of the game was lacking the Sarapite stuff and getting to that the Sarafite war [\u00a0__\u00a0] the island war that we get in the end of Abby story, I wish that",

And so here, I at least appreciate that we're we're getting um some of those touchstones to touch back to later. But I also really liked the story elements of her just trying to save a saraphy kid and then now a Sarafi kid is the reason that she almost died would have died had the alarm not went off with all of that. Like I just feel like there was there's a lot of good symbolism going on in terms of the character themes and what they're trying to get across of not just like the oh when you seek revenge it's all this stuff.

You touched on an interesting scene that I wanted to go back to though, right? The scene with where with with her wanting to save the teen Sarah fight. That was that was a moment where I really started losing touch with the character because that seemed so out of pocket for where she should have been emotionally at that point.

I mean, see, my thing is I feel like this Ellie is dumb and I think that they show that the entire season of Dena being the one like without Dena, I feel like Ellie would have died way earlier and you don't feel that in the game.

Like, there was a part of the game I remember finishing the game being like, I understand. I get why people like this. I never want this experience ever again.

Having said that, the second we get to Abby being like saying the line, which is I let you live, you wasted it. And then go back to day one, I was like, I will watch season 3. I will absolutely watch this. And I think to your earlier point, I do think it was a disservice. I do think it's a disservice that we don't know Abby well by this. And I know that's how the game was broken up. I'm presuming as well. I don't remember the game that well, but I do think it would have been like the touchstones that I had of this season, the things that kept me watching were the Jeffrey Wrights, were the Abby moments, were the wolf, was that that sort of, for lack of a better term, sort of like classic Walking Dead, we",

And so the more of that we got, I think the better the season overall would have been. And this is just kind of where we want. I think we just spent way too much time with Ellie and the revenge kick. And I would have liked to have seen those characters fleshed out more so that by the time we did shoot because by the time we get to the point where, you know, we see what what Owen was to Abby, it's going to be eight episodes from now. You're not going to remember the emotional impact of either of them dying at this point. And if you do, they're going to show you a flashback. Who cares? We've already seen it.

I don't care about them because they're just two people I've seen for 20 minutes on screen all told. Right now you jump on now. Yeah. Now. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Like I feel like Ellie's focused so much on that what is it Seattle day one where it's like the open world part of Seattle. That's some gameplay [\u00a0__\u00a0] you know?

When I think about the things that I want to see more of, I want to see more of that story. And that's why I'm very I'm excited for season 3 in that regard. Yeah. Um, let me see if we got any super chats. We do. Dana says, \"This Ellie just overall seems incapable of the revenge she's going after. Also, the time she's escaped death this season. Uh, it's also come down to purely luck instead of skill.\" Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's no Yeah, there's no big arguments. Oh, I was sorry.

I want to see what their world's like. I want to see their fight with the Sarah five and we're going to get that. But it's back to the thing you raised here, right?

So, I feel like that taking up quote unquote screen time of the season, the progressing the story forward stuff is uh tough because looking at it, it's like I feel like most people don't really like the main story of season 2, but they really liked the flashback stuff of season 2 that just take up uh took up a lot of the time.

I do think that introducing um Isaac and going back into his stuff as a setup in this season is going to allow hopefully for more clever interactions in the next season. And I think that is something that I'm hopeful for because the game doesn't really interact story to story as much as I expected it to. You see, yeah, I would disagree with that comment though. I think Isaac's an incredibly compelling character and I think I think the the compelling characters from the story maybe don't necessarily translate over and this is exactly what we're talking about, right? I wanted more of him. I wanted more of that dynamic. Like I wanted more of what's going on in the thing. I wanted I wanted I want way more of that story and way less of Ellie getting rained on and you know having to sacrifice all of her friends to go on this revenge kick that we all know",

There's no more meat on that bone. Let's be perfectly honest, right? Like it's just she's mad because Joel's dead now. She's going to go kill these people. how hard I mean, you know, seven seven episodes later, you know, she's that one friend that you're just like, the party's over. You know, we can't drink anymore.

It does give you an avenue for promotion of season 3 of well he's here he's and you liked him a lot and you saw what you did here we gave you a bunch of interesting tidbits right even the end here in this episode right where he's talking to his general or whatever and she's just and he word from Abby and they go into this whole thing I was like why is he asking about Abby right he's talking about her crew I'm like oh okay they're doing this so we as a viewer would be set up they're like wait why isn't Abby with why isn't Abby doing the assault or whatever you're planning yeah uh CJ spliton says season two HBO slump House of the Dragon WW and this Westworld.",

Oh, West I never I never watched season two of House Dragon, but Westworld season 2 was a You did season two? I think so. That just come out. I mean, at least a year ago, not I've only seen I only remember seeing season one. Yeah, cuz I if we don't if we didn't review it, I I probably didn't make it a point to watch it. But yeah, Westworld was Westworld season 1 was one of the best seasons of like sci-fi television HBO's ever freaking done.

I was looking forward to the show, everything. I'm I'm looking forward to next everything every week, and I'm looking forward to next season for sure. I I think here's where I'm at with this. I would bet that if season 2 of Last of Us was 20 episodes and it just covered the entirety of the game, I think I'd be in love with it. Absolutely. I just think that it being split up this way, there's no way this could have lived up to season one. I think that's actually impossible just because of how incomplete part one of a multi-part story is. It's tough though because this is an act two, right?

By the time they get to the theater, that's three. And then four is the epilogue where she has to go down and do what she's got to do in my opinion.

Like I said, I think we're being I'm being critical of this last episode and maybe Ellie's journey, but yeah, I enjoyed the ride for sure. It did what it's supposed to. Season 1 was nearly perfect, if not perfect, right? So, it'll be interesting to see what they do with this next one. And again, all the questions we had even about this one of how you going to do it?

Are you excited about July 11th? Uh, so much so excited that HBO is doing the thing where you can watch the trailer. Have you seen that? If you go to HBO, like if you go on your app on TV or whatever, they have the trailer for you. Go watch the trailer. And I was like, D, go watch this. And man, I'll tell you what, when your wife's not into something, it really it really is a web. Like, she goes, this is what she said. She watched the whole thing. She goes, is that dog CG?

I'm really bummed at how it's being split up because I think it's really not going to do a service to the overall experience for for the game. But can't wait for season 3. Um let us know in the comments below what you think of The Last of Us on HBO. Uh after this, we're about to do our Subway Surfer stream. This the three of us with Roger Picorny.
