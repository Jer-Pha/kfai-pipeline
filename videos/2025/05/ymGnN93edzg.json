Then after that is going to be a Subway Surfer sponsored stream, which I'm incredibly excited about. It's going to be me, Greg, and Nick hanging out with Roger Porny as he schools us on Subway Surfers. We'll see who schools whom. We're definitely going to. And I feel like it's just going to be us annoying him. That's what it's going to end up being. And I'm excited for this. It's probably going to end up being more podcast than a stream. So come hang out if you're a Kind of funny member. Today's Greg weighs 27 minutes about Superman fever. Superman, it's here. Someone's got the the sickness. Yeah, it's Greg. When is that out?

It's been over 10 years since the first version of Mario Kart 8 came out. We have been playing it consistently, Barrett for over 10 years. Greg, you've been playing it consistently. No, that that was the whole thing of like when I I wanted to be on this show, it was going to be you guys.

But like I played it, loved it, but put it down and moved on, whereas you guys never have. And so it's interesting to be here to talk to you about it and games of service versus that. But no, I mean I I love this game, but I I don't have the the consistency you have. Uh well, I am excited to talk to you about it, though, because uh the game's been very consistent. The game has been dropping on a lot of stuff over and over. I have a full timeline that I want to go through, but I don't want to get to that yet. I want to first just say the first one came out on May 30th, 2014. So, it literally has been over 10 years since we've played the majority of this game uh for",

But before we get into the nitty-gritty, because I do want to go kind of thing by thing, Barrett, uh, event by events, addition by addition to this game, and kind of talk about our thoughts now, reflecting back that we've had extensive time playing through those iterations of the the journey that we've been on. Uh, but to start it off, I do want to give our review of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the 2025 edition. Yeah.

And then the list goes on in terms of a game like you're talking about that we've played how many years ago, Tim? How many years ago, too? Yeah. I mean, 11. 11 years ago, the first time we ever played this, let alone the fact that it survived, let alone that it's satisfied, let alone that it's sold the way it has. I mean, even ripping all of that away and just getting down to what it feels like to be on the track. The game feels great. The game is an amazing Mario Kart. The game is a great gateway in, I think, as I see Ben playing it for the first time and really learning all the things I remember learning when I was playing Mario Kart. for me, Gamecube being where I really enter the series",

The classic clip of me racing Ziger and the how try to keep up feud we had on kind of funny. What an amazing game that even if you're as casual or young as Ben versus middle of the road like me or obsessed like you guys are, I think is a game that consistently can be an amazing enjoyable experience. Like I think it's a 10 out of 10. It's it's it's amazing. Bar Courtney, I'm a [\u00a0__\u00a0] idiot. I'm a stupid [\u00a0__\u00a0] idiot. Cuz I would give this I think a a 9 to 9.5.

Um, you know, nothing has changed for me of the overall feelings that I've had for Mario Kart since I first played the Wii U demo of Mario Kart 8 at like a Best Buy. Uh, did they force you to do the motion controls for that? I don't remember if they forced me to do the the motion controls, but it was the airport level and there it was my first time like truly playing like an uh a Mario Kart in a bit and it just kind of like the joy of it and the kind of like theme park uh like kind of amusement park feel of it just like washed over me in a way that I was like, \"Oh my god, I need to get a Wii U.\" It was the reason I got a Wii U. Right. Uh granted we're talking about uh deluxe and the whole package but that initial yeah it's it's part of that journey and I think all of that stuff is still so amazing even you know seeing some of these tracks over and over and over again",

There are still moments that like get me like happy and giddy of, you know, um driving through what is I assume the Shy Guys like little home in like a tree and all that stuff. And the way they play with like perspectives uh in Mario Kart, I think is is so fun. It feels good. Um you know, a lot of the a lot of other cart games still look to Mario Kart for like what a cart racer should have, right? And uh there are some that get close to that, but there's just something about the feel of Mario Kart that I still don't think is uh has been quite replicated to that same degree. Uh I think the the reason for the 995 is uh you know, after all of these years, you know, like yes, there's been consistent launch, but then there was there was a bit of like a kind of dead space",

And I think also um you know hindsight's 2020 of just the way the multiplayer works is still like kind of weird and clunky that it's in 2025 it's one of those like yeah this was this was definitely designed for the Wii U era and not thought of even I would argue for the era of when the Switch was coming out in its first year. That's a great argument and a great point. Yeah, I think I give it leniency because I still think of it as a Wii U game. But you are right that it did launch on the Switch as a modern thing and it has been around this long.

Um and so, and we'll we'll talk about all that stuff later, but um yeah, this is even with my like not you know, committed 10 out of 10, this is still one of my favorite games of all time. It has given me it has given me hundreds and hundreds of hours of joy. I don't even know what the exact hour count is because Tim, you were telling me that like hour count uh changes whenever you like change your account from one switch to another. And I've gone through three different switches. So, at least on this switch, I'm at 200 plus hours, which is just this one switch. Just this one switch. Uh, and so yeah, I I I truly adore it",

As do I, my friend. As do I. Robert Gettys. Yes. What do you score Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the kind of funny review scale? I feel like I am a bit more lenient when it comes to to giving out tens if I feel like a game really is special despite not being perfect because 10's not perfect on our scale. 10 is masterpiece and I can't fathom not saying that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a masterpiece. Like to me, this is the pinnacle of the genre, a genre I love very much. And Mario Kart hasn't always been my favorite when you compare it to its contemporaries in the cart world.

And I don't think that it can feel better. And the only hope for Mario Kart World, and in my experience so far they've nailed it, is just keep it the same. like really just keep 90 plus 98% of the feel uh the way that they had it cuz the drift mechanics, the way the courses are are laid out, the momentum this game has, so much of that is just like, yeah, this is how this is supposed to feel. I can definitely nitpick a lot of specific tiny little things because I've been playing the hell out of this game for over a decade.

Um, the introduction of the the hover situation of like just the gravity making all these tracks. They took I mean essentially every track ever made in Mario Kart and by the end of this it's was modernized to be in this and taking just the completely flat 2D tracks of Super uh Super Mario Kart and turning them into these incredible spirals of a visual journey as you're going through uh this these insane courses.

They're like, \"We're trying to go to a bit rounder, a bit cuter, a bit more cartoony, like the Mario Wonder vibe of um the the art style.\" Whereas this, they're like, \"We wanted everything to be very sleek. You see Mario's face in the title screen and he's kind of like looking like a badass a little bit. You know what I mean?

I've been uh streaming uh periodically on my own channel uh the older cart games that are available on Switch and it was my first time playing Mario Kart Super Circuit and it was I didn't realize that I probably had read at one point that Riven Ribbon Road was from Super Circuit and it blew my mind of like what they took from Super Circuit which is like barely a theme and it's barely there and how they're able to adapt it to like one of my favorite uh tracks I think in Mario Kart 8.

Um, but yeah, I I really feel like I can understand uh giving this a lower score because the the single player is so simple. It is just the the Grand Prix. I think at the end of the day though, there's a lot of content there. I do think some of it can like we don't need mirror mode.

What I will say is in 2020 when everything shut down and the world changed, yeah, we're looking at it here. Like it's so so cool how they did it.

Some of the best courses in the game, I would say. And the the crossovers really showed, oh, this team cares. It's not just throwing something in here for it to to be there. The Hyrule course having the rupees instead of coins, right? Obviously the music being so good, being able to like uh jump through the the Master Sword if you like hit the three little boost things and it it makes the sound and all of that stuff and like the the uh the song for it too of like how they're able to mix the more like kind of rock and roll a lot of guitars with Legend of Zelda is just like ooh",

Like, great stuff here. The music and the the vibes of the um of the game being translated very well. And then F-Zero, same thing. The countdown being the F-Zero sound instead of the Mario Kart sound. It's like there's just so many dumb little things that add up to I feel like really showing a polished package that a lot of DLC things you don't get that from.

The thing is, Greg, you can't forget it because it became part of Mario Kart 8. That's right. Uh, Mario Kart mobile had uh 59 on Metacritic, but it also had a ton of new courses. 14 new courses based on realworld cities. New York, Tokyo, Paris, London, Vancouver, Los Angeles, Berlin, Sydney, Singapore, Amsterdam, Bangkok, Athens, Rome, and Madrid. And then seven new Mario Kart courses, including Skyhigh Sunday, Yoshi's Island, Squeaky Clean Sprint, and Piranha Plant Pipeline.

And, uh, the one thing that this game did that was kind of interesting is the instead of going lap by lap and having it just be the same thing you're doing, it functioned more like the Wario Snow Mountain level in Mario Kart 8 where every lap was its own kind of uh, thing. Well, I I and I would even argue like it it took that a step further because yeah, like we all love Wario Mountain because it's that iconic like you're just going uh straight in in one thing.

No. See, to me, this this feels like they clearly were like the plan of Mario Kart World is going to be a Switch 2 game. like let's just any idea that we had let's just get it done.

I I think I really enjoy like the the moments where you go through iconic like uh uh buildings or whatever in these courses are when the these courses shine, but I don't think they do that like nearly enough to keep up that what we expect from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe of being that constant uh you know, you're at an amusement park uh kind of thing. Like the tour courses are like the Epcot of uh Mario Kart 8, but like so good. Yes. But like they they they were almost there of making Epcot feel a little bit more special.

So and and Greg to your question about the the shout out like shout out version of it like I do think in comparison to the DLC for Mario Kart 8. Yes. Because like these the Mario Kart 8 courses were just as good if not better than the original courses whereas these in terms of visual fidelity in terms of visual creativity they're a dramatic step down. Uh but it also makes sense because they're applying them adapting them from the the mobile game. U my biggest issue with these is uh they start to all feel the same and the going through like you were saying earlier like the course in different ways for each lap.

I'm just like, well, y I got to start over again because I made one wrong mistake because there's just too much going on in the screen in front of me. Yeah.

And it it so rarely gets love. And when it does, I I feel like it's more Yoshi in general as opposed to that game in its art style. And the Yoshi's Island course in this game is such a love letter. Like again, it starts off with the level start music from Yoshi's Island, which you know, Yoshi's Island, not a racing game. So, the the fact that they went as far to change that, even the coins have the Yoshi face on them. They're the Yoshi coins.

Uh and to be able to get all those things, you need to um get gold in all 200 CC courses, including um actually no, not including the DLC. And there's another one where you need to get three star for all 150 CC. There's one you need to beat the Nintendo like professional time trial ghost on each of the levels to get the the tires.

So, you have to win 500 races with 10 coins essentially if you want to like uh take as little time possible collecting all those coins.

Uh, and so yeah, Mario Kart World, what do you have to say about it? I mean, your question, I am with you having played it. I've only played it at 100 CC cuz that's all they would let us do and it was very slow compared to what I'm used to. And I think that's a combination of a couple things. One, it technically is. I'm used to playing 150 if not 200. Um, so it being 100 cc, I don't really hold that against it because I'm sure you just boost it up. You don't need to deal with that. The other problem is Mario Kart World tracks are significantly wider. So the perception of speed feels slower too. Yeah. Um so that is I I think a potential issue.

But the on rails things, jokes aside, feel a little too on rails. M like it feels like you're just kind of stuck into an animation and at like a certain speed and I don't like that. Like I feel like uh some of the advancements that I have noticed so far in how this plays is the momentum feels better of like in Mario Kart 8 when you hit a wall you're just you're just done. You need to like restart. This kind of feels like it gives you a little bit more like okay you clipped it so it slowed you down a bit but you can keep going. That's nice.

Whereas 200 for at least the majority of the courses that was like a okay, we have to make this all work and I don't think it fully does for all the courses. Um so we'll we'll see with that. My biggest concern with Mario Kart 8 is that the single player open world stuff is going to be awesome, but because of what we want from it and expect from it, it is going to be a let down. I I think that Forza, they're opening themselves up to uh more criticism than just a straightup cart racer. Yeah. Um and uh from what we've seen, there's a ton of things to do.

I would say like not even hitting the expectations of like a Burnout Paradise, you know, which is a game that came out, 15 years ago. Yeah, something like that.
