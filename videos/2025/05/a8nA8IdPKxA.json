I just did two bags of of Fritos right now. Just took them to the face. So, the thing is uh that that box has lasted through the week and on Friday I looked in there and I saw a Lays a bag of Lays potato chips and I was like, \"Oh, I haven't had one of these yet.\" And I saw that it was the last one, but I als I already ate multiple bags of chips. So, I'm like, \"I'm not going to eat it right now.\" And so, I took it and I put it on my desk and I was like, \"I'll have it as a treat when I get in on Monday.\" Like a secret Snickers. Exactly.
