It's your guy Snow Bike Mike welcoming you to another kind of funny games afternoon stream on a lovely Monday which we are dubbing Magic Monday, y'all. I like that. And of course, you don't have to adjust your screens. Yes, that is Tim Getty's here on a live stream. It's a special day if you're here, Tim. It's nice to be in the lab, you know. It's very I'm not used to it. The temperature is always not what I expect. But I'm feeling good. I'm ready to look at some Magic cards. I think this this might be the moment. You know, Tim, if it's not this, it'll never be anything. So, and Tim, if it's not this, then Spider-Man has one more chance. But truly and honestly, if it's not this, this is probably going to be our only moment. And I am very in from what I've seen. I have not seen all the cards.

I've also brought in my main man, Blessing Out of Yoay Jr. to join us as well. So we have the whole squad here to go through the cards list. So these are all the cards that they've revealed so far. They are still revealing some cards, but these are all the cards revealed so far. And there's a lot of them, Tim Betty's, and blessing them. So I'm very excited to show you guys all the cards.

And I've play I'm playing 10 two. So I'm I'm I'm dabbling, Tim. And you know what happened here is when I went through these cards and you see they label all the different Final Fantasies that they're from. It got me so excited of like, oh snap, I should try some more games. So I think I think that's very cool. But I have no experience with Magic whatsoever. And then we have Bless over here.

Uh and like I dabbled here and there, right? Final Fantasy 13 I remember starting back in the day on PS3. Stranger Paradise Final Fantasy can't forget. I wonder if there's any cards for that. I doubt it. That'd be awesome. If there is, you're going to see me. They go deep into it. So, I'm excited to see what you guys pull. I did this a little bit on my own little Twitch channel.

Not just video games in in any media. and um love the characters to death. Obviously, we've talked about Final Fantasy 7 and its uh various iterations uh a lot here at Kind of Funny. Love those characters as well. But there's also a ton of other Final Fantasies that have amazing moments and characters and weapons and places and all that stuff.

Um, they also have like the colors associated with them, right? So, like Tetus, I believe, is probably what green, blue, let's say white. I'm not sure if that's the case, but if Tetus is like those three colors, all the cards in your deck are modeled after those three colors. And yeah, Tetus sets the tone as far as you can play him uh at any time during the game by spending the mana. Um and that is dictating what your strategy of the game is. Yeah. So, we have Tetus, which is your counter blitz. We have uh we have, of course, Cloud, which is limit break they're calling it. We have a girl with green hair. I don't know who she is, Tim.

So those are your four commanders that will have all specialy deal decks built around them and then of course as well on top of that too because we all love Sephro and Cloud. You're playing now just standard decks they have them themed after Cloud and Sephro. Awesome dude. I love buy and jump right in. I love that Tetus gets that much love. You know I couldn't believe that pretty damn cool. I I do feel like we're about to get into this like 10 renaissance. Uh the Tenna, if you will, and I feel like it's led on by Mike.

I I have some shots. like there's some people that are missing in here and I'm a little uptight about it. Okay, I'm excited to see see that. So, uh, my last question before we start looking at the cards is would it be possible to get into playing Magic? I don't want to say competitively, but like, uh, well, like well enough with this set of cards. Right now will be the best time for you or any video game fan that might love fan Final Fantasy to jump in because they're giving you a big offering of four different commanders to be able to play Commander, which is your more social fun experience with up to four players or",

Right. And so it's a great opportunity to jump in. Right now they have Spider-Man on the way here. So, that's another big jumping point, but this is probably going to be the answer for like video game fans right now. Way way better than what they did with Assassin's Creed. Assassin's Creed was cool, but they took this to the next level. So, I want to just real quick hit show filters. Oh, wow. Okay, so there are many more colors. Yes, we have white, blue, black, green, uh you have multicolor, you have colorless. So, all these will start to fit in and I think when you see them, Tim, you'll be like, \"Oh, yeah, that fits into this kind of color brand.\" So, jumping into this, looking here, we",

Is that the equivalent to grass type, fire type, whatever in Pok\u00e9mon a bit, but I think it's a bit more uh deeper as far as like what the colors can mean as far as what the cards, both what the strategy of the cards are, but then also like the energy of like kind of what they do, right? Cuz you know, for Pokemon, you have fire type, grass type, it's all about the elements. In Magic, it's almost more about like the vibe. So, like Yeah. the style of play. Yeah. So like for red it is like a lot of destruction. For black it is you might play with the graveyard a bit. Right. With white it might be a lot of like regaining life and healing. Exactly.

So like blessing who likes to make his own decks, legendary creatures are just above the common creature like you'll see with the Mughal, meaning that they have some sort of special move that they're doing, some sort of play that they you can be tied to and built around. And so you can build anybody as your commander. The legendary creatures always have like the best abilities uh in the game and like they're so OP that you can only have one in play like Okay.

I mean it's just your strategy, right? like the commander uh is so you don't draw a commander from your deck. Every card you have in your hand you're drawing from your deck. Your commander sits in the commander zone and you can summon it at any point uh just by paying the mana. Whenever your commander dies, it then costs a bit more mana to resummon it. But basically the purpose of the commander is to always be available. So you can you can build your strategy around that. Okay. Yeah. So then cloudbound Mughal. All right. That's uh I guess from 14.

Hold on. We got to read Aerith's text cuz Aerith's ability is kind of cool. So, she has lifelink, which I mentioned before. You get life back when you attack. Uh, whenever you gain life, you put a plus one counter on Aith, meaning um her attack goes up by plus one. Uh, when Aith dies, put X plus one counters on each legendary creature you control, where X is the number of plus one counters on Aith. Uh, which basically means to him when Aith dies, she transfers her power to whatever other legendary creatures you have. Which is [\u00a0__\u00a0] cool. That's cool. That is tight.

Basically like what they do with a lot of these is they take magic terms and then contextualize them to what their ability would be and whatever whatever lore they come from.
