The following day, I believe, is also damn. But here's the thing. On Monday, the plan is to do a death training to all of your questions answered. Wow. Podcast. So, like if you have any big questions coming out of this preview, write them in. Write them in on Monday and we'll be able to talk all about them. Massive. Uh housekeeping.

Tomorrow, Snowbike Mike, the most athletic man in his own mind, is embarking on the most daring quest yet, going step for step with Stam Porter Bridges in a literal marathon stream on a treadmill. Join Roger and Mike this Friday as they attempt to do a full playthrough of Death Stranding one through the weekend, but they can only do it with your support.

For now, let's start with what is the topic of the show. Bless, you're a gallivanton out there in Japan. You got to visit Kojima Productions and got to play a decent chunk of Death Stranding 2. I got to play up to 40% of Death Stranding 2. Um, so I was in Tokyo for a week at Kojima Productions for about 4 days essentially full-time playing Death Stranding 2.

Uh, they allowed us to play up to 30 hours of the game. I actually don't know where my final hour count is. I think technically on my demo station. It must have hit at least 30 hours, but like we were getting lunches, right? Can I go pee? No. You sit there and you play the [\u00a0__\u00a0] game. No, but like obviously like you know there is times where I'm taking breaks. There's times where like at a certain point me, Dane Racker, and Skillup went off to record um a little preview conversation that you're going to hear later in the show because that is the second half to this episode, right? Um so this is going to be chopped up into two chunks. This first chunk is going to be me setting the stage for my own personal preview of Death Stranding 2 and giving context for what you're going to get later, which is yeah, me, Skillup, and Dan Riker uh talking all",

Like playing up to 30 hours of a video game this early in a preview fashion is [\u00a0__\u00a0] bizarre. And um I figured it'd be really cool to have a conversation with other people who got that experience as well. So that like we can break down, we can get into the meat of it because between the three of us, that's about 70 to 90 hours of gameplay depending on where we land um as far as how far we made it into the game. And if this is your first time listening to uh gaming podcast or if you're just kind of interested in Cojima uh video games as a whole, the way previews usually work is you either play something at",

Uh my Dragon Age Veilgard preview was I believe a 5 to 6 hourish uh preview as well. But what they do is they say let's drop you in the beginning where you're kind of like, you know, getting your your feet wet and then feet wet. Yeah, you're getting your feet wet. Yeah, that's good. That's correct. Good. Get them feet wet. You know, I don't know where that comes from. Yeah, I don't know. May maybe test out the waters. Test out the waters. Test out the waters so we can get your feet wet.

And this time they said, \"What if you just played 30 something hours?\" Which is incredible. And again, I agree with you. Super odd. really really odd super odd. Um, this was one of the coolest slash weirdest preview events I got to take a part of. So, like I mentioned, up to 30 hours, right? There also there isn't that many restrictions around what we can talk about. Like we can talk about story stuff. We can talk about like all the items, tools, upgrade systems. Like the only the only restrictions they gave us were like three story moments. uh we can't talk about licensed music and we can't talk about like the preppers in the game that deliver missions and like who appears and and stuff like",

Outside of that, they're pretty open as far as like, yo, talk about whatever you want, which there's a deeper conversation there as far as like, huh, you guys are are very forthcoming with allowing us to talk about the game, which makes me wonder what's in the second half of the game because so much of what we played um appeared in the trailers that we've seen for Death Rain 2 as well. So, I'm very fascinated about the back half of this game, but obviously this conversation isn't about the back half. We're talking about that first 40% of the game that I got to play. And you know what a lot of the conversation is that you had with Dan Riker and Skillup that you'll be seeing after when we get to our ads or whatever. You know what a good chunk of that conversation is cuz you were there",

But you mentioned that there's a lot of other stuff that maybe you weren't able to get to in your death shiny experience that you'd like to kind of, you know, speak about now. Exactly. So that's what I want to spend this first about 20 minutes talking about, right? is the stuff I didn't get to get to uh in that uh conversation with me, Skill, and Dan Riker. Um tell us all about it, Bless. Well, one more thing I want to mention, too, is that they didn't allow um either they didn't allow phones or laptops or anything electronic at the at the PlayStations. Um no shoes. And so, only socks. No shoes. No socks. And so, they handed out physical notebooks. Uh and I have about 22 pages of notes. That's awesome.

I think this is going to be really hard to beat for game of the year. Everything is on point. The story, performances, depth and gameplay, music, fidelity, detail, fun, combat, spirit. This game has it all. Um one of the things you're going to hear the most in the preview cycle for this game are the words Metal Gear Solid 5. No. Oh god, don't do it to me. Legitimately, that's one of the things you're going to hear the most. I think a lot of people are going to make those comparisons.

It's you are delivering, you are doing all of those systems, but it's filtered through I think a lot of the quality, a lot of the depth, a lot of the fun of Metal Gear Solid 5. And I think one of the bigger changes that you that you see in this game um is the combat where you play Destiny one. No, of course. Yeah. Uh and I'm part of the OG review crew. No way. We were on We were on the in the old studio with Fran Mirabella. No way. It was a very different time. Yeah. Well, in Designing One, you remember encountering those enemy camps that are like the human enemy camps, not the BTS. And that [\u00a0__\u00a0] sucked.

In Death Rating 2, they made a big change where every bullet is a rubber bullet. And so like you are just knocking people out for the most part. And they've turned these camps from the frustrating thing of death stranding one that nobody really wanted to do into essentially like me solid 5 like you're infiltrating, you're sneaking through, you're taking people out with with guns. You're basically Solid Snake in these camps now. And so it went from me kind of being like ah kind of dreading it a bit to now I'm excited to encounter a human enemy camp because they've provided you with so many tools.

Yeah, anything in the game. any of the big structures in the game um you can use to make a watch tower and then yeah if you if you use it it'll like um give you this tower view over an enemy camp it automatically marks people. You don't even have to mark people yourself if you're using that tower.

I can pick people off one by one and then as soon as somebody sees me it is machine gun machine gun them down with my rubber bullets and then get whatever package or objective uh that I was trying to do. And why can't you kill them? Uh because that'll cause a void out if you remember death rating one. Killing people is very dangerous because the whole area will explode.

There's more weather systems that are really cool. This game has a dayight cycle, which I forgot that Death Raining one uh didn't have. There are sandstorms. Um, when it rains, the tide will rise in the rivers or lower rise. Um, one of the first things that happened uh in my playthrough as I'm like making my way walking toward toward the first destination is there was a gatequake, which are essentially like what they call earthquakes in the game. Uh, and the earth shook and then a piece of like the mountain that I was on crumbles down in front of me in real time. And that [\u00a0__\u00a0] looked [\u00a0__\u00a0] cool. Whoa.

It's similar to seeing how in that that most recent longass trailer, the Cojima 10-minute one where we saw the the avalanche and the water breaking through the dam, you know, like that. It seems like they're going real deep with details like that. Exactly. And so much of it feels, I think, finely tuned based off of what Death Training One is a game, right? One is as a game, which is walking around these beautiful environments delivering packages, right? Everything about Death Training 2 feels tuned towards making that experience more engaging and more fun and more interesting. So, you have those weather effects. Real quick, just to get back to the infiltration uh portion of it, were you ever at odds with having too much [\u00a0__\u00a0] on your back and carrying too many things?

How do I like were you ever at odds of like ah maybe I should go deliver things first before I come back here? A lot of the missions that I ended up having uh I wouldn't necessarily need to go I oftent times if I'm in infiltrating it's because I need to get something out of there. So it's usually like I'll take people out and then grab what I need and then get out of there or yeah if I if I have a bunch of [\u00a0__\u00a0] that I'm carrying I either go around or like sometimes I'll just drop them off.

We got to do like a group interview with Cojima as well and that was one of the questions that uh he tackled was around like the camps and stuff and he mentioned that like he would watch people play and he would be surprised that more people just don't drop their [\u00a0__\u00a0] and then do the camps like a lot of people apparently while play testing would just straight up take their [\u00a0__\u00a0] into the camps and Kuji was like oh that's not what I anticipated but all right cool like play how you want to kind of thing.

Um, the game has a lot more uh pass through paths through upgrading um like yourself and upgrading like vehicles and stuff. So, there was one vehicle, you know how when you go into uh like one of the structures and you can like um look at what other people have in the garage and kind of like take their vehicle uh cuz everything is is shared socially in the game. Uh, I was surprised when I found certain vehicles where I'm driving through and it has like a little auto turret in the thing and then also like a little thing to um automatically grab packages.

Um, but keeping it top level because one of the things I want to mention too is the fact that this is one of the rare uh Cojima direct sequels if you know what I mean. So like to explain that further when I talk about Metal Gear Solid for example, Metal Gear Solid 1 and Metal Gear Solid 2 is obviously the same franchise, same series, but very like different as far as the jump of you are now playing as Ryden. You are, you know, like kind of have a different feel of what very different story from Solid One. You hop into Metal Gear Solid 3 and it is you are um you know playing as Naked Snake, you're playing as Big Boss um in a jungle sort of environment,",

You hop into Metal Gear Solid 3 and it is you are um you know playing as Naked Snake, you're playing as Big Boss um in a jungle sort of environment, different feel. Metal Gear Solid 4 feels very different from MGS3. Metal Gear Solid 5 feels way different from all the MGS games. Death Raining 2 in the first uh 30 hours or so of playing feels very much like a direct sequel to Death Raining 1 in a way that I think has allowed Cojima Productions to really go very iterative as far as how you're making this game better. And I think it's way to its benefit. Again, that's not to say that something crazy doesn't happen in the second half cuz I don't know and I'm still kind of expecting that. But um all the things that I'm talking about here as far as what they've added into death rating 2, they feel like direct answers and reactions to what people might have wanted post death rating one.

Like it reminds me of playing Fallout and just like being in those in between points of I'm just walking to Diamond City or I'm playing Skyrim and I'm just like trying to get over this mountain or whatever. It's a game that is totally built around that experience and legitimately like I felt rejuvenated. Like like I'm 25 hours into this game and I'm like I don't want to stop playing this. I just want to play this game and relax, right? Like I was kind of dreading this at first cuz I knew I wasn't going to get to take my save home and I was like I don't want to play 30 hours and then have to replay the 30 hours for the review.

The highest praise I think you could give is that you put 30 hours into a game and you're like, \"Yeah, I'll do that all over again. I'll do it so easily.\" Yeah. Like I can't wait to get back to it. Uh, and before we get to Skillup and Dan Riker and you, right after the word from our sponsors, I wanted to ask, how many mo times were there where you were talking to other journalists or other people at this event, other press, and you all had not experienced what the other had experienced?

It feels like gameplay can be a bit more emergent this time around than in previous Death Strandings. And yeah, I it's not like there are events happening left and right necessarily, but in talking to Dan and like hearing about how he played versus hearing about how what Skillup did in his time, we all sort of had our different stories about how we tackled certain things and the ways in which we're playing and the tools that we're using.

They have like a stat level leveling up system that reminds me of Skyrim in the way that the more you do something, the more that [\u00a0__\u00a0] gets leveled up, right? Like there's there's like a backpack patch system where um you know how the Resident Evil has this inventory system where you have to arrange things based off like their shape or whatever. Um your backpack you can now put on like these patches onto your backpack that'll upgrade like your actual skill. Um or like I guess upgrade backpack [\u00a0__\u00a0] right?

And I figure one of the best ways to talk about it would be with other people that have actually played the game. Uh because that's going to allow for the deepest dive possible for kind of funny at the very least, right?

I fundamentally believe that and I believe that from the very start.

There was a director's cut where it's like myself included, that's when we kind of came back and re-evaluated it. Okay.

But then at the same time, obviously there are a bunch of people who do want this to evolve in some way and whatever else. So my kind of like high level takeaway after like 20 plus hours of play is that like I think Death Stranding one was always perfect, but it took people a while to realize that. And I think Death Stranding 2 is the same, but it helps people realize why it's going much faster. Oh, it gets into it cuz like the first one took so you have to establish so many things in that first game. Like why are we eating these little bugs? Why are people crying? What",

I think everyone I've talked to agrees like you're just, you know, getting to Sam's shelter where he's living with Lou and it's playing this incredible woodkid song and uh it's just an incredible start to the game. Like there's not like some long, you know, 20-minute buildup or anything like a lot of games do. You're just kind of going right away. True.

I think it's a lot taking that feedback into account and also what people did enjoy about like the Phantom Pain. There's a lot of Phantom Pain going on there. That's an interesting point because I've heard a lot of people say that like that's definitely been a big discussion point and I wonder what so how do you come to that conclusion? So the main thing that makes me think that is in the first game I was very much uh I I tailored my gameplay to avoiding combat encounters. not even combat encounters, just enemy camps and stuff because you were so discouraged from like you'd get guns and stuff but it's like well if you kill that guy you got to take his body to a lake or something like or",

This one it took a while for me to realize that like kind of all the weapons you get without exception so far that I've seen are non-lethal. rubber bullets. It's but I mean you're using them like a assault rifle. It's called assault rifle. You get a tran grenade launcher. So you're like shooting grenades that are like they'll make vehicles explode and everything, but like you can play it like an action game. So like now if I see a bandit camp, I am looking forward to it cuz like okay, I'm going to build a watch tower here. I'm going to",

Doll Man's my guy. I'll tag all these dudes and everything and I'll try the stealth thing. It's kind of like how I would play The Last of Us. So try stealth. I'd maybe get one or two kills and then things would go to [\u00a0__\u00a0] and then it's like, \"All right, gun's blazing.\" And you can do that in this one. And I don't feel like you could do that in the first one. And like the combat's really good in a Phantom Pain kind of way. And like all the feedback of like head shot into the slow-mo stuff. I think that's the for me the easy comparison when you want to talk about how Phantom Pain might influence this game is the combat feels like Phantom Pain light almost, right?

It was way more about the enemy camps being an obstruction to what you're doing, right? As opposed to in Death Rating 2, the enemy camps, it feels like a all right, cool, we're going to go in and take everybody out. It almost feels like a far cry. It almost feels like F and Pain um in that way. Uh, and and actually that leads to one of the more interesting things I've seen here is that an early on part of the game has a bandit camp that has a missable important cutscene that it seems like most people saw it and I did not see and it sounds like you go into this bandit camp and there's a bunch of these like red like ninja guys including everyone's describing to me.",

Secondly, I could tell it was written by an Australian because there were very subtle words that you just don't know exist unless you're Australian.

Sure.

MGS2 to MGS3, you're in a completely different setting, different character again, right? To MGS4, different game. MGS5, completely different game. This is really the first time, at least on this scale, that Cojima has made a direct sequel that is very much like, no, it's just a sequel.
