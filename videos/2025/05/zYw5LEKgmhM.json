I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the master of hype in no joke, no lie, no nothing, no cap, my favorite one of your little Zeba hoodies, Snowike Mike. Uh, thank you, Greg. You always make me smile. And I want you to know that this is a medium and I'm an extra large. How does this work? I don't know, but we're making it work. I mean, it look I mean, is it do you feel comfortable in it? I feel very comfortable. Now, the guy behind the counter definitely looked at me and was like, \"This is a medium.\" And I said, \"Well, it fit. It fit.\" And I walked away. Rich Lambert, game director on The Elder Scrolls Online. Is he pulling off the medium? He is. Thank you. Looking good. Our guests are saying that. That makes me feel good.

You've already retired once. You already tried to get out once. They pulled you back in. I I I've launched two games since 2001. So, uh Right.

Okay, this is their game. Oh, this is this great spot where, you know, nobody really knows the historical record of what was happening. Have fun with that. I need to know what we're talking about when we say, \"Hey, let's make a new entry into the Elder Scrolls universe. Make it online multiplayer. Do all these different things.\" How do you tackle that from a story perspective? That's a really good question. I mean, it really starts in the location. Where are we going? What are we doing?

You get called in this meeting room and they're like, \"Hey, come out of retirement. Come do this for us.\" Like, \"Can I default it?\" They say, \"No, you can't.\" You're like, \"Okay.\" Even when you say, \"Okay, we're going to do this.

Like, where are we at? How does that happen? So, it really starts with you sit down and uh none of us use this terminology then because it's more modern than 2007. But what we really do is we set up what I call the virtual world. Like what do you want players to do in this game? Don't worry about the IP yet, right? What do you what's what's happening? Like uh and and like I said in the previous episode or two episodes ago, um like we knew we wanted a strong PVP system. we knew we want which if you if you go down that road it starts asking a lot of questions like who's fighting in this PvP system.

In a three-sided it it can go on forever. And so we were committed to that. But that asked a lot of questions. Who are the three sides? And then that asks the questions, all right, there's nine provinces. Well, there's 10, but what's happening with the right? And then the question start, well, who would be allied together? What are they fighting over? And then you're like, Siridil's in the middle of the map. Oh, Oblivion just came out. We don't want to really go to Siridil because that's where Oblivion just was.

Um, and then it's like, okay, now we know that there's these three alliances fighting over the throne. What does each alliance do? Right? And Rich, I think, came up with the names, which is like the pact, the alliance, right, and the Dominion. And the names of those are very evocative of what they are. The right the pact is like three groups of uh provinces that aren't usually allied with each other but they're in it together because it they have to. The alliance is like uh we're a union of equals and then right and then the dominion is like okay you're here whether you want to be and if you look at the stories for each of those alliances",

Rich for you come coming up with these names. Yeah. Like is this just you guys back in your house on a holiday break with a ball like a tennis ball bouncing off the wall. What about this one? This is in the basement at Bethesda which is where BGS was at the time on on whiteboards. Yeah. In the loading docks. Yeah.

And that's that's gamedev, right? And you just keep going until you're done shipping and then keep going and going and going and going and going and going and going. But to get there, you have to build a series of boxes, right, that you contain the story and the developers and the narrative into because it can't be wide open, right? You have to be like, okay, this story is going to be about this and right, you're working in the IP at this time, so you're going to have some limitations about that. So, it's not like blue sky, do whatever you want when it comes to the storytelling. It's more like you're telling the story of the Dominion. What are they dominating? Right? How how how",

Literally, Mullig Ball has stolen my soul and I want to get it back. That was literally the tagline for for the main story. Um, and so, right, and then it's like, okay, that that's what we knew about the story when it started. Nothing else except Muller Ball's stolen my soul and I want it back. Yeah. And then uh was it was Lawrence did a lot of a lot of that. winded a lot of that stuff for for bringing back Man of Marco and they're like, \"Oh, man of Marco, right? Here is a necromancer who could work with Mullig Ball, right? And he comes from um going really deep into the geekery of Elder Scrolls. This is what it's all about. Four-part show to get",

Four-part show to get as geeky as you want.\" But but but Manamarco is is like the uber lich in the Elder Scrolls universe. He's he's lived for almost forever and he pops up in various Elder Scrolls games doing various nefarious things, but he's always the head of the warm cold. Um, and the seasons coming up is called seasons of the worm cult. So, um, but it's uh, right, it's like so we have a we have a villain now. We have Moolik Ball who's a Drich Prince. And, uh, again, our frame of reference at the time was Merun Deon stomping the Imperial City flat at the end of Oblivion. So, that that concept was fresh in our mind. And if you played that part of ESO where you get to meet Moolik Ball, right, uh, I'm not going to spoil it too much, but there's a scene very similar to that except he's stomping you flat.

So you have you you have Mana Marco, you have Evil, you have Moolik Ball, you're getting your soul back, and then it's creating great characters, and that's what the characters just start to organically happen, right? Like, and going into that stuff, I think a really good example would be Cadwell. Like Cadwell wasn't actually part of the main story when we originally pitched it. You know, Cadwell was written specifically for John Cles once we realized we could actually get him. Yeah. And the team went off. They went and did their thing. They introduced this new character.

I don't know how we got him. Yeah. Um I I mentioned it in in the earlier episodes, but um Zenamax obviously pre Xbox had a board of directors that was full of Hollywood people and so Hollywood insiders and uh so we had lots of connections and even um the past Bethesda games had major major voice talent and uh and that's the reason it's cuz we they knew those people and so uh it was uh we were given a pretty good budget because it always makes great headlines when you say that you're working with Malcolm McDow and Kate Beck and Sale and and John Cles and uh Alfred Molina and uh Michael Gam, Bill Na, right?

And he's believable in that character, right? And it's because our writers, which we'll I'm sure we'll get into, our writers are amazing in ESO and know how to write a character that could take advantage of John Cleas's unique personality. So, you you've laid out so much on the table for me and I like that. I appreciate that. Thank you. You say when you're sitting there, you know, well, forget the world and the IP. What is this game?

I mean, there were there were so many different ones and some of them actually got cut. Like housing was an original plan. Many of them got cut. Yeah. Um but we just didn't have time to do it. We couldn't, you know, do it the way we wanted to. Um but we we started going down the well, what is a Elder Scrolls player want? Well, they want the single player story stuff. Okay, we got got that pillar. What do MMO players want? Well, they want group activities, so that's probably where dungeons come in. That's where trials come in.

Yeah. because you really find the fun once you start playing it and then you realize what's necessary and what's not and then you realize what you literally can't do because of technology and you pair that back and then we don't have all the time in the world or budget so you pair it back a little more and that's where you end up when you and I'll start with you Rich but when you think back to this whiteboard and you think about everything on there do you laugh to yourself like that like you were that ambitious or that's what you thought the game would be?",

And then you take a step back and you look at that board and you're like, that's going to take us 30 years. Like, how can we do all this? And so then you have to go through this triage process, figure out what's the most important, um, and then start building on it. And there there are things, like I said earlier, there are things that we wanted to do for launch that we just couldn't get to. and we eventually did put in the game.

You can do basically whatever you want. you want to get outside of that, come talk to us. So, dragons, right? Dragons were verboten because Skyrim had just launched and right and was still going strong and it was no dragons, right? Yeah.

And and that was that was part of the fun of, you know, the the negotiations, I guess, in all of that, which was, okay, dragons aren't generally in the second era. Why were they there? Uh, and how to train your dragons was the the thing that popped into my head. It was like, well, they just got released out of a vault. We could make something up. And apparently, they were hiding in a cave for a very long time. Who would have thought? They were they were locked away in a in a in a cave in a vault, and you accidentally set them free, and now you got to go fix your mistake, right? And yeah, it was really cool.

Um, and generally Bethesda game studios always focused on a single province and did like that super deep dive on the on the province. Um, and really Arena was the only game that had them all together. And so being able to dig through some arena stuff through lore books and all that other pick and choose the the really interesting bits and that was something that the team really enjoyed like Rancers War was a really good example of that, right? digging through and that was just a lore book and we turned that into like an entire series of stories in in Rivenspire.

So, so I'm gonna mangle this answer a little bit because I know I'll get called out by someone who watches it, but uh uh I think I believe it was EverQuest made an amphitheater and it was where players were supposed to going to get together and and do performances and everyone was going to go to the amphitheater and of course after launch nobody went to the amphitheater, right? everybody was in South Row like like fighting uh dorm right in between the comments and and so that's the beauty of these games is it it's hard to script what people are going to do when you get into",

Yeah we focused really heavily on the services side of things making sure that there was a location somewhere in a zone where they got the things the vendors the you know all of the crafting stations like all that that was the the focus.

But yeah, and we didn't design that. That's just players found it. Yeah. And I think the other other big part in that too was access to guild traders. Yeah.

And so in 1999 he started Zenamax to be a media holding company where they would buy different companies. And it was 1998 it was you know do era and so they bought a lot of companies including this this little startup called Bethesda Softworks which had been around for 15 years. Sure.

What was that moment of, well, we can do all of this, are we leaving this behind? How do we find that blend to make sure everyone can see it in all of its glory?

We wrote a we we have our own engine for, right? Um and um we started by licensing an engine and we basically over time before launch just swapped it all out for our own. So it makes decisions like going to console or hey now the next generation of consoles out and we want to do you know cool lighting and shaders and uh since we can do that all ourselves because it's our engine. It makes it makes that possible. And our engine, our client was specifically designed for scalability.

We talked about the new players jumping in and what they're experiencing. What was that like to finally circle back? How long did it take the team after 10 years and be like, \"Oh man, the starting areas, maybe we should go back there and reook at those.\" I mean, o over time as we've launched new things, right? Our tools have matured. We've matured as developers. Our art has matured. Uh, and a lot of those starter zones were, I guess, some of the last ones we built before launch, but they weren't up to the same standards as like our latest chapters, our latest DLCs.

And we started digging into what that meant. And we looked at everything. We looked at, you know, specifically lighting, doing propping, doing clutter passes, and then swapping out like ancient ancient assets for newer ones and and whatnot. And it really changed the spaces like just doing the water going from the old water to the new water was night and day difference night and day. We have old water in very very old water. Yeah.

And they want to be perfectionists and yeah, looking at your your older stuff, you want to redo it and we have to find that balance between a complete overhaul and just touching some stuff up. I know I am number one when it comes to guilty of this, but I am the player that when I get something new, I always ask, well, what's next? What can we expect? And what is that balance like?

Is there a perfect world or is it just we got to do it every single time? A lot comes down to what teams are doing what and where they are. Like it takes it takes a while to build a zone. Um so like we're releasing this first half of Solstice or in June I guess it is. Um the team's been working on that for nine months already and they're already working on the second half of that as well. And so it just it just comes down to how much bandwidth does the team have.

Generally, we divide players into different behavior types, which is like co-op, PvE, uh story based, sto, you know, questing, uh systems based like crafting and uh right. And uh we want to make sure that every year we kind of hit those groups at least with a couple of new things like new dungeons for co-op PvE, a new story, new quest, new zone for for the story people. Um which is kind of the foundation of the game of course being being Elder Scrolls.

And so you the two parts broken up. It's the two parts, right? Broken up. Um and the the worm cult has kind of erected this thing to protect whatever's on the other side. And you don't know. And so as a server, you are working together to bring that wall down to open that second half up. So each server will progress in their own way, their own pace. Wow. Which is cool, right?

So now back to Mike's question, sorry, of things that were similar to that or learning experiences on that path to this whole wall. So, I think the the closest thing, you know, we obviously we've got lots of events in game. We've got, you know, the New Life Festival, we got Witches Fest, um, things like that. We have our prologue quests. So, those are the the quests that kind of give you that little teaser into what's coming up.

What has that been like talking about jumping back to the starting areas now creating kind of a new welcome? Matt, what's that like? It's he's being careful to figure out how we could go through and do this. But um I think the best way is is you know we use a lot of player metrics and player data to kind of help inform some of our decisions. And the launch tutorial that we had a lot of the feedback we got was it was too long. Just get us into the game. We want to play update six was our first new tutorial tutorial. Yeah.

So that was when we started thinking about, okay, let's do a new tutorial every year. That, you know, looking back, probably not the right thing. Pro tip, don't don't do probably not the right thing. Um, but yeah, and so we just started continuing to iterate through that. And then, um, we took a a really hard look at that and what it was doing to player retention numbers and things like that. uh with Gates of Adamant. I don't know if you guys remember that, but that was I guess that was last year's tutorial that we did where you get to the end of the tutorial. And then",

But imagine you're a player who has never experienced this world before and you go through a tutorial and then you're there's a choice of things that you have no concept of what you're choosing. And can I tell you the game? I was on the phone with all my friends like, \"What alliance did you choose? Where are we going? What how do we all stick together?\" So, yeah. Like, yeah. And and so again, you know, looking back at it, it's kind of like, well, duh. Like, why would you give players that many choices when they're just starting the game?

So, and so we did that and we went back and and we kind of this latest tutorial that's that's out right now is very much the old one but with a lot of improvements, focusing on the areas that players need in terms of core mechanics to to understand the game and be able to play the game better and introduce the story the re the main story, right? And not a chapter story. Sure. Because it got really confusing for people that started and say more wind and they did it and they finish the story and then they're like, \"Oh, wait, there's more, right?\" And then there's like seven, not 70, but you know, there's a ton of other zones and stories and uh and that they were kind of sheltered from until that.

But it's you guys, it's Bethesda Game Studios. You're figuring out you're noodle in the story. You get this thing going and then this is something I honestly don't know like what happens next is it we talked about it being mechanics and a PvP pace and this is so is it that somebody goes and you start really rough with an engine?

And then um inside of that it's like okay then you have to then then it gets to your point which is what is a zone, right? And and it's like and that's usually a technical exercise of how much stuff can you load in at one time? Are there loading screens between zones? We actually had a version of Tamreel that there were no loading screens and then we decided to go to loading screens uh for a whole another reason which we haven't talked about which is our mega server technology um which allows uh a lot of the social systems uh that we have in the game.

Interesting. But uh and we didn't have to worry so much about memory and stuff in that sense. But yeah, so it's like you're making the Daggerfall Covenant. Okay, got to have Daggerfall, right? Okay, let's start in Glenn Umber, which everybody knows from the from the game Daggerfall. And then what's in there? Okay, the Red Guard are there. So you got to have Sentinel and uh and the the orcs are there, and we're not going to give the orcs a homeland until after launch. Yeah, they're the they're the underdogs for sure, right?

Um, and then we, like I said in last episode, we fixated on Storm Haven because we needed to focus the team on one zone, get something correct, and get something correct and then replicate that uh throughout the rest. And so Storm Haven actually grew and shrank and had many quests in it and then had not enough quests in it. And finally, we hit the right balance of it's 15 hours to get through a zone. I forget. We came up with a yeah it's about with a metric 15 to 20 hours right and then then we replicated Storm Haven to Rivenspire which we also redid about 50 times and uh I it was only five but it was I mean it it's known to us internally as revision spire because we redid it I love that.

At what point or is this while you're doing all the trial and error for the zones are you having somebody concurrently write and write and write? Okay. Yeah. So, we knew what the stories were going to be for the zones early on. Gotcha. Um, so there's a main story that goes that carries the player from the be from the tutorial through to the alliance to the end of the alliance and then into Cold Harbor, which is where the story ended in the in the in the launch version of the game. And so, we had that spine and then you see what POIs, what points of interest there are in each zone and then you start writing a little quest thing for each of those and then so the stories just kind of grow from there.

Oh yeah, Commander Shepherd. I think the best way to think about it is we tried to build a a box for the teams um that you know had that spine had a couple of key points and then let the team go and fill out the world and so a lot of that stuff just kind of started to organically happen as the team started to iterate on things.

How do we choose the next thing? A lot of that is like conversations between Matt and I and it and it comes down to like looking at what we've done and we try to do almost the exact opposite the next time.

We literally used the height map from the game Morin from Elder Scrolls 3. We imported it in and made our zone based on that. That's awesome. So we in we actually leaned in to making sure that we had is because we were 600 years before the events of Morwind. So we could have lots of call outs to what was going to happen 600 years later. And if you play through it and you played Elder Scrolls 3, you'll be like, I know that guy or oh that's the grandfather of that guy or Right.

I mean, there's been a whole bunch of stuff, but like for the this starting core, here's who you can be. How do you zone in on that, Rich? That was really hard. It wasn't We didn't really start nailing that stuff down until like 2012. Warrior in Storm Haven. Yeah, it was. And we don't even have a warrior in the game. That's that's that's the funny part. There is no class called Warrior, but there was for three years. A warrior in footy pajamas in Storm Haven. Yeah, that was uh so it was just a lot of trial and error, a lot of trying to dig through like what are the kind of core fantasies that players want to fulfill as their class and we ended up, you know, digging",

Yeah. And then Sorc, right? Those were the originals. Yeah. Um and how do they balance a PvP game? How do you make sure no one's overpowered? Right. constant figuring out. And the fun too with that is you could use any weapon and any armor type. And so like how do you balance with all of that and how do you know we've got this deck builder game but you can your class is really just three skill lines and then there's 10 others that you can add to you can make a healing based rogue a healing based or you can make a a heavy armor two-handed sorcerer, right?

There's a clear path that you need to take, but if you want to role play some pretty crazy combinations, it's it's all it's all there. And it's only getting crazier now, right? Again, the direct a couple weeks ago, we're talking about subasses. Yeah, it's going to be But we're taking skill lines, but we're taking skill lines that were balanced, right? And and mixing it with other skill lines that were already balanced. So, um I'm sure there will be uh some revisions at some point because that's the way these work.

There's the meme video that I'm sure everybody's seen about developers where the square peg goes in the round hole and the triangle goes in the right like it goes in the square like that is gamedev in a nutshell and I laugh at that video anytime I see it because yeah we built it with this in mind and players do the exact opposite you're like huh okay good for you right exactly um but you know leading up to subclassing the the last three four years we've been focused on balance and standardizing things and right like going through literally every combat system and do that.

So that when we started adding in all this other crazy like now I can be a nightblade with warden abilities, right? or I can be a necromancer and a warden and a sorc, right? And have just pets galore. Like what does that look like? And and yeah, that like there was a method to the madness, but it was it was a long long haul.

Talk to me about that. Our next episode is all about community. So, I think it's a good like build up to that. That's a good GDC presentation. What is an MMO? And the answer there, every game's an MMO. FIFA is an MMO. I mean, like it's it's multiplayer in massive numbers is everywhere at this point. But, um, yeah, it's MMO is more of a technology than a game design now. It's a technology that let lets people play together in whatever way the game designer wants them to play. Yeah.

It's it it is when you hand the game to the community on launch day, right? you you lose control. Not all control. You lose some control, course, right? And and then you you look at what players do. And did we think we were going to have one of the premier uh end games in the in the game were going was going to be housing? No, we had no idea, but we're very happy that that it is.

Uh if you ask five ESO players to describe the game that they're playing, they will describe five different games. And to me, that means we've succeeded because we've made a virtual world where different activities are valid and fun and players love to do them together. Michael, I'm just going to mic drop on that. Give me the outro. You covered on your stuff. Uh yeah, I'm excited to jump into the community. We haven't we've tiptoed around PvP and I think community really drives that. So, we'll talk about that. Housing is a fun one, Greg. The addition of all of that.
