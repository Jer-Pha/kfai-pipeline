When asked if he'd like to direct a film, Cojima replied, \"I already have. It was called Metal Gear Solid one through whatever.\" He didn't reply that. Uh the actual quote was, \"Oh yes, I've received many offers after leaving Konami.\" Cojima went on to explain that he has multiple video game projects in development and that he may consider making a film once Death Stranding 2 and Fizzant are complete.

I mean, this is a guy that we talked about just a couple weeks ago of like as he's entering the, you know, the golden era, the end of his career, what has he got left in the tank? What will he still be working on? And when you think about this next game, right, we still have OD with Xbox in the middle of all of this. So, five to six years out seems about right from the announcement that we had here with Herman Hol and the saying of like, yeah, we're going to get to that here in the future. Five to six probably more generous. Seven is probably right where we're at. Do you do you think part of him hopes that people forget about OD so you can just work on physics?

Uh yeah, that's one that I'm I think I'm way more fascinated by because fizzings we know will be a return to form with espionage action. It's why we love Cojima. why we grew up and people like me were putting him in the people you'd like to meet on your MySpace profile section. Like I was like, man, one day I want to meet Cojima.

I think you look at it and go, \"Okay, well then that means OD's got to be what, three years, four years if we're pushing it towards the back end.\" But yeah, this is a a man here who's probably looking at the tail end of his career going, \"How much more do I want to spend on games? I have a passion for directing. Can I still do that?
