Hi, Tim. It's nice to see you. Nice color t-shirt, you and I. I like it. Uh, and I hope you're doing well. I haven't seen much of you in this past week. Is there an energy to what you're saying? Why is what the what you're saying a press conference right now? Sounds like a press conference refusatory. I just don't get enough Tim time right now and I'm I'm going to talk about it, you know. Okay. Okay. Joining us as well, of course, we have the literal taste maker, Roger Picorny. Uh, it's nice to see you, Tim. Um, I haven't seen you in a while. We had our first 101 in a while. Um, it's really good to see you and, um, it's good to see Nick here. Yeah. And rounding out the group is of course the producer/seducer. Of course is a weird thing to say.

That's what we're talking about today, everybody. Um, but we might also talk about other things cuz this is the kind of funny games. Each and every weekday we get together to talk about the biggest reviews, previews, and topics in video games live on YouTube, Twitch, and podcast services around the globe.

Little housekeeping for you. We're an 11 person business all about live talk shows. After Games Daily, you'll get a preview. Uh oh, sorry. I already we're doing that right now.

Yeah, I don't think I have either. Yeah. Um, thank you to our Patreon producers, Carl Jacobs of Makeabuster, and Delaney Twining. Today, we're brought to you by Shady Race, RF Frames, and Rocket Money, but we'll tell you all about that later. We got to talk about the topic of the shows.

Um but every once in a while there's a diamond in the rough that pops through and last night I read something that goes as follows. Uhoh. We buried a $10,000 treasure chest somewhere in San Francisco. Y 5 weeks ago, we buried 10K somewhere in SF. Why? We always figured treasure hunting would feature more heavily in life.

Uh they put out Oh, they have a map like Goonies. A little Goonies map here. Okay. 18 bold letters preserved in a clearing site. A dark room's view of a brave surfer's reel.

Like they were just like hey we know that this is wild and not a great use of our money but we had to do it. Well, it's like when you bury a body, you have to wait for the the growth to grow over it. That's exactly so people can't figure out where you buried it. Exactly. So, Mike, how's this make you feel? Uh, Tim, I'm excited. Let's get all the streaming equipment. Let's hit the road.

Yeah, we played FBC Fire Break, an upcoming first-person shooter video game developed and published by Remedy Entertainment. Set sometime after the events of Control. It follows a special unit of soldiers named Firereak. It'll be Remedy's first multiplayer title, and it's set to release on June 17th, 2025, just a little over a month away for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and Windows Game Pass and PS+. There we go. And that's cool. Okay. Yeah. Well, Alan Wake wasn't on Steam. Oh, good call. Good call. So, that's a big deal. Yeah. Published by Remedy. When I think about the people at this table, Mike I think is a dabbler. He likes to dabble in any type of game. Single player, multiplayer, doesn't freaking matter.

I didn't love it as much as many people did in the press. Um I think it's for a multitude of reasons. Uh one I did the things I did like I'll start with there. I I like the way that this game looks. Uh I like being in uh the oldest house again and uh reexperiencing the world of control through a different lens. Right. Again, as we said uh earlier on in the synopsis of the game, you are playing as uh different people in the oldest house that are now basically taking out a bunch of hiss and which is essentially zombies uh in this world uh using crafted uh items that are you know guns that are super old like you are just picking",

Uh so in that sense it's fun and it's engaging and there is a lot of weird remedy charm there when it comes to the jobs and the weirdness of all of this. Uh and also the music is really great. I just didn't have much fun playing it and that says a lot because I was with these two jabronies laughing and having a great time just hanging out as people. But when it came to the game and we picked it up, there's just there wasn't that pick up and and play fun nature to it that I expected after watching a behind the the the scenes closed door um uh presentation that they did a few months ago.

Uh where you want to pick up that that thing with your friends and just and just play through it the entire night. Uh as soon as I picked it up, I was like, man, the guns I understand the bit here is that these are old guns and these aren't uh the these aren't the most high-tech. You're not getting Uzi's. You're not getting anything like that. You're just getting an old uh double barrel shotgun. You're getting an old SMG, and you're getting a rifle.

I was finding the difficulty in just reloading the gun and trying to figure out how to use this gun in a in a way that is any way fun or engaging to for hundreds of enemies to be coming at me, right? It just I never found that flow and I think by the ending of it we found a little bit of something.

Mike. Yeah, it's uh interesting Roger says all that because I agree with him on the fun aspect. I did not have the most fun playing this, right? It did bring me back to the Left 4 Dead days, right? Four of your friends, three in this case, gathering together, completing missions with basic objectives, right? But it was fun to work together of Roger and Nick would have to go out and turn on generators while I hold down one area and fight off a bunch of monsters made out of uh Postit stamps, right?

I want to spend this time with my friends and have a little bit more of an easier fun experience.\" I think they have that here. Unfortunately for us, the jobs just weren't that engaging and all that fun, right? It is the most bare bones jobs that you can do of run to this point, stand next to this, hold down X, it's set up, go to the next spot, right? And so for me, I just couldn't find the fun. Uh difficulty wise, we uh ran into some when you level up certain things. We also were astonished at some of them. We did the first level, Tim, on the beginner difficulty. It took 2 and 1/2 minutes and the level was over. And it felt like we loaded in longer than we played. And that was a big",

But I I did not enjoy this experience at the end of the day. I didn't see myself coming back for a day two or day three as I thought I would when I think of Left for Dead and others. Nick, what about you? I'm unfortunately with the guys as well on this. I think it started picking up toward the end when we started getting into those uh engagements with the bigger you see the bigger Post-it monster there that's in the trailer. Like when you get to that and the three of us really had to use our job skills to sort of overcome that. There was a level of strategy and coordination that had to happen.

We need Mike for this. Um, to be fair though, I'm probably the one sitting at this table that likes this type of gameplay least. I don't like PvE. I don't really like these these grindy games that make you feel like you're just doing tasks in an artificial world. Um, somehow Hell Divers managed to do to have enough built-in mechanics and enough built-in chaos and in a bigger open world feeling that it made you feel like there was more dynamics or dynamicism in it. Um, but this really does feel like it's they're they're really holding like they're really accounting for the charm. They're really saying like, \"Hey, this is you. You like Control, you're",

And I and I I would bet money that I'm not going to I'm not going to play this game again. Yeah, there's just not enough um differences when it came to the runs that we were doing. Right. Again, the the the there was three uh jobs at launch, two extra that are coming out by the end of the year uh in in post in postgame DLC that's free to everybody.

The biggest changes that we did see were as Mike alluded, we started off the game and it was like a shock of like, oh no, is this what this game is? Like we got scared because you start off the game and without like normal difficulty, we go in there and it is just shoot a bunch of stamps, shoot a bunch of enemies, go back to the elevator, end of mission, and we were like, \"Oh no, is this the game?\" But that's like their version of a tutorial. They just didn't express that correctly. Uh so then as you keep on playing it, it gets further and further into the level and then finally we played it and there's a huge post-it monster. And uh that's what happened for the rest of the jobs as well. Uh, but replaying this Posted level multiple times, that charm of, \"Oh, it's a Posted monster kind of goes away really",

Like I was not charmed by, you know, the weirdness of it, the wackiness of it. I wanted the world to change a little bit more, right? When I think about the oldest house, when I think about the way the control was built, the whole idea is that the world changes, right? Like you can go to one area and then it's different than it was before, right? That's not necessarily how it works, but like that's just the lore of it, right? So, the way that they kind of pitched it and they talked about it, I was expecting more of like a rogike situation here, and that's just not what that is. It it some things changed. There are some randomized elements uh we can talk about later. There was this random um rubber ducky that",

I think it was I think it was throwing like um like fire on things also on myself. Uh so that's like a randomized element that pops in and pops out, which is neat and I like that uh because that's the type of stuff that I'm looking for. But the actual gameplay and like the level design itself did not change. So it became kind of mindless at a certain point until we started ramping up that difficulty when they start moving around some of the um uh the health and the uh ammo stuff. Yeah, I think Back for Blood was a game that we played a little bit, right? That was the the sort of successor to uh Left for Dead. And I think I vibed with that game cuz if if you felt like",

So more of that I think would go a lot well. More puzzling elements, more more platform elements, things like that. Uh, but when it when when we got to the point where you had to shoot piles of Post-it notes over and over again, I was like, I don't this is this feels like this feels like I'm just doing work now. Yeah. I was down at a preview event last week in LA and a lot of the people that I was with had also gotten to to play this and I was talking to them about it and the the consensus seemed to be uh not glowing, but I a little more positive it sounds like from from you guys.

But one thing that uh they all kind of agreed on was that this seems like the type of game that isn't going to be the biggest hit in the world, but is going to find its audience on Steam and we're going to see like a pretty like high the number just kind of continue to rise as like people kind of sit in. It's like this is their game for a bunch of like old boomers essentially that just want those glory days and it being on Game Pass, it being on PlayStation Plus, it kind of being having a greater chance at success for what it is. Yeah. Do you do you think Roger that that is uh in line with how you see this or are you like ah it doesn't have the stuff enough a little bit?

They don't have any of the stuff that a lot of these uh uh free-to-play um uh online games that you constantly have to check in on. It feels like a second job. This does not have any of that, right? you can play for a month and then drop off and then come back when all the DLC is there and then boom, you're right there with your friends, right? So, I think they have it right there in terms of that audience. I just I question if like the general audience that maybe doesn't know Control that doesn't know any of this stuff picks up this game and plays it and says, \"Man, this is the thing for me.\" And doesn't look at Hell Divers and say, \"This has that funner that funner immediate loop that I just in my mind I just don't think",

Like, so inherently, you don't have that fun gameplay of shooting a bunch of alien monsters and blowing their heads off. It feels like you are very slow and you are your character is not it does not reload ammo fast enough. So, there's this constant fighting against the mechanics, which of course you will be able to upgrade, but also the upgrade system, I think, is kind of whack. Uh the uh the it's basically uh a battle pass. So, in order to upgrade your single weapon, like for instance, I really like the SMG, and I was super excited. I was like, man, I can't wait to upgrade this weapon because it's going to [\u00a0__\u00a0] rip. Oh, I need to go five pages into a battle pass. That sucks. Like",

No, I have to get one upgrade per page of random [\u00a0__\u00a0] I don't want in order to get the upgrade for the weapon. And I finally get the upgrade at the end of this uh PlayStation, and I feel like it didn't do anything. like that is the stuff that is going to make people turn off the game. Um, and I hope that stuff gets balanced out because when I upgrade this weapon, especially if I'm getting five battle pass uh layers deep, I want to be able to feel that gun rip a little bit better. Nick, how'd you feel about the upgrade system? I I felt the same way. Yeah. I mean, if you're going to put a battle pass system in there, every single thing on there needs to be not",

And to Roger's point where I just wanted to see what the guns felt like at level two, level three and to get there felt like it was going to be you always get to that precipice where you go, \"Oh, I see how much longer this is going to take me to get enjoyment out of it.\" And everyone has that moment where you got that's my threshold. And I would have if it wasn't if I wasn't playing this game for review uh or for what we're talking about right now, I uh I I would not have done it. I would have been like, \"No, I'm good.

Um, but for me, I didn't didn't catch fire, especially once we did get the level two SMG and seeing what that reward was. But I I was more interested in the job system, right? I think that's something we should talk about is there's three classes. we'll call it that each person can pick into. You can run double up on classes, but each person has kind of a role that they can do, right? Somebody has the jump start kit that can restart a battery that might, you know, turn on the shower that will heal you or turn on the ammo box, right?

I do like that mechanic, by the I like the mechanic that you are a fire team. You're basically firefighters and so water is your friend and if something explodes and and water starts coming from the ceiling, you just stand underneath it and it will heal you, which is pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. But none of them felt I don't know. We all felt like we were needed, but we also weren't needed, right? I think there was moments where it's like I don't think Nick needed to be that car that class character, right? Like we can you can do everything without having to ensure all three of you the different classes, which is good and bad, right? The",

The positive is I had the jump start kit so I could quickly jump start a battery, but if we didn't have that, Roger could go up and do the quick time event with the RBLBs just quickly spamming it and it would turn it on the same way. So it never felt like it was needed where we all need to do this or at the same time it's like well we could just be whatever we want. It doesn't matter. And you don't you're not locked into it because you can switch between jobs in the middle of a mission. U I believe it's I don't know if you die you die you can come back and get a different kit which is which is nice. That's a nice quality of life thing right there. But um but I I don't know.

It's like, okay, there's three, so you're the guy, you're the guy. Okay, I guess I'm this guy, right? Like there is no fun of like, okay, well there's five of them. Well, you do this and I do this and maybe I should do this guy. I don't know. Or you pick per level, right? You're familiar with the level. They're like, \"Okay, we need this level of chemistry between the three of us to to beat this easily or for the strategy of it.\" Yeah. And as Roger said, we did three jobs. I believe there's five jobs launching at at launch and then two post launch there. And so that's good. We got to see three, right? So the first one is the postits, right?

And your job is to, hey, go shoot 2,000 Post-it notes. And so we shot 2,000 post-it notes and then it was like here's a boss section and then we retreated back to the elevator. We were done. And then the next time you load into that at the next difficulty it would unlock a second room. And so then we'd go into the next room and then the next room would have the giant post and not monster. And so by round three it was like oh we know where to go. None of the levels as Roger said ever changed. Right. There was no left right or crazy turns. It was just where's the ammo and the health box changed, but they expanded, but they were always the same. So, we knew exactly where to run. I mean, sure, Nick",

Uh, one thing that we did [\u00a0__\u00a0] up on that would have made that whole experience better was that we realized by the ending of the of the play session that you can unlock respawn areas. So, we would basically what was happening was we would die and then one of us would respawn all the way in the beginning of the level and then we would get lost cuz there's a million [\u00a0__\u00a0] hits and we're like, I don't know where I'm going.

And that's where we were shooting these giant like beehives, these ugly little larva sacks that would drop these giant glowing green balls. And we had to fill up a little like mining cart with them. And so Nick and Roger would run out. I would protect the mining cart. They would come back and drop the balls in the mining carts. And then step one, we'd run back to the elevator, we'd dip out. Next run, we'd go to the next area and we'd do it all over again. Yeah. Every time it felt like you would load into the job and it would unlock the next area for you.

And then there's one more. Yeah, I'm liking on it. And that's the unfortunate part about it. It just doesn't stand out. Yeah, that that's the issue. The win right now for this is there's an audience that really wants PvE games with them. People and their friends can just load in and just have a fun night chilling and relaxing, right? No crazy challenge or make the challenges you want, right? The positive about this game is it's coming in at $40 for the base game, right?

Also, the third one is the furnace, as Michael Ruiz says in the chat. So, that was Yeah, that was when we had to jump start the furnace and like one of us would get burned alive. That was that was like the first first one we played, which was a little frustrating at first, but then once you figured it out, I think that's one where I kept getting like we were in the room, just kept getting lit on fire. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's just very basic cooperative experiences where it's like, hey, we're in room number one. There's two points we need to run to.
