But like, you know, I think what they did here as far as introducing us to the new version of the show, I feel like the last couple of episodes have existed in like a different ether than like the first couple episodes. I think episode one and two felt like the continuation a bit of episode one, even though that feels weird to say because it's all season or Yeah, season one. Thank you.

I think this apocalypse got to be a top five apocalypse or worst five apocalypse to exist in I'll say, right? Like um I think there was the line partway through the episode where Dena's like, \"Man, what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is up with Seattle?\" Right? you know, and like you look at all the different things happening at once and it brings me back to I think some of my favorite um feelings of watching Walking Dead back in the day of like when something new gets introduced when you get to the farm or you get to like the governor's town or something and it's like",

Uh, and then not to mention like the excellent excellent uh redoing of like how they have the reveal of Ellie telling Dena that she's immune, Dena telling Ellie that she's pregnant. How that then leads into them confirming their relationship. Like I that that's been one of the few moments in watching this TV show where I'm like, \"Oh, y'all did it better than the game.\" Like there are very few parts of the show for me where I would say that.

Fantastic episode of TV, fantastic episode of The Last of Us in terms of the pantheon of great episodes here. Uh yeah, they continue to do what we've complimented them for week after week, Tim of right, build off of what we already know and expect, but make it better. Flesh it out again. The stuff here with Isaac I thought was so well done. And what a cool opening, right? To go back to 2018, have him back there. Is it wish is that Drake or Josh? One. Don't you dare. Hilarious.

Pulls the fresh meat with him, goes back, tosses the two grenades and shuts it. It's like damn that's awesome. let alone to get it to then, you know, where he is years later, obviously incredibly jaded, working with the wolves, burning people. And Jen was like, \"Oh, we were watching that after like, oh, was he he was he was in the game, too.

Again, I think it's so special that they were able to nail that aha take on me moment the way the game did cuz I remember when you get to that scene in the game as you know Neil calls out in the afterwards of like it was a fan favorite. It was something you couldn't miss whatever. I didn't miss it playing it.

So well done. And then yeah, the the changes they made, the things they did. I I had a great time last night. Was it was it Take on me that they sang in the game as well? Oh, I didn't know. I think I missed that part. Oh, yeah. Really? Wow. That that's I didn't know you could miss it, but I guess that's just the way I played that game.

And for me, the thing I enjoy most about the the HBO version is where it stays the same and where it decides to be different. And as long as it's still great, like that's what matters. And I think that for me, the show continues to make the right choices and what to change and how to change them. I think that the relationship between uh Dina and Ellie in the show is better is almost a silly thing to to go with. I love it. like that's all that really matters.

Uh I feel the first couple episodes we've gotten here of all the Jackson stuff got us to a point now that when the changes they made with the reveal of I'm pregnant, I'm immune, all that stuff, it just hit harder for me. Um, and I I thought that the them getting together officially and like the that whole scene was just believable. Um, in a way that I feel like they could have really fumbled if they made just a couple different choices in the prior episodes, but they got us here in such a beautiful way.

Like it it there's this human factor to it all. I'm so so damn impressed with it. And on top of that, the amount of things that happen in this episode is kind of wild.

And it gives me a lot of hope for as we get towards the end of the game dealing with the the Raptors and the Santa Monica stuff. like I'm hoping that we get better, more fleshed out and uh like already like I thought the WLF was great in the game, but um seeing the scene with the the Sarafite being um tortured is it's so brutal. It's hard to to watch and hard to look at, but the the dialogue that they have, I think, is so powerful. And him saying that the we um how many wolves become saraphites like every day somebody does.

[\u00a0__\u00a0] uh and Dena then like kind of talking to Ellie about like no like you know I'm I'm I'm like girls but like my mom you know taught me this thing which wasn't right like it all came full circle in a way that I was like wow this is really beautifully handled like I like how even just Ellie being like I'm going to be a dad that was something I got to laugh out of and that goes back to like different than the game and which is better and which is done well",

But it's like this of just I'm going to be a dad. It's just again I think it strengthens the Belly Ramsay version of Ellie and I was talking about the cinematography and stuff earlier about like how the show can do such unique things like coming into the light is such a theme of Last of Us both one and two. But her uh Ellie's sleeping and being woken up by the the water falling on her. And when we ever see from her perspective looking at Dena, you can't see her cuz it's just blinded by the light, right?

Now I'm back to being Dena and I, you know, I'm here. I believe you and I'm scared and I'm I'm crying and everything else. Yeah. Yeah. I I will say like I am I do want more push back from Ellie as far as Dena being pregnant and going along in the mission. Like I I know we got a bit of that toward the end of the episode and you know Dena looks at her and is like or I forgive if Ellie said this or Dena, but like they're like together and they hold hands.

Like this the chances are that this isn't going to go good. You got to send Dena back. See, I understand that, but I also feel like they're in this on another level than video game Ellie and Dena where I feel like they are it's together. We're doing this 100%. It's been that way from the be the literally the beginning with the cookies, right? I was just like, I brought this cuz you're going to be mad. Here's everything I know.

If they'll bring Dena in there to really signify that they're together on this for us as viewers or whatever, cuz I think that's sweet and I think it establishes the relationship and where they're going. But I think just the way they're playing this relationship, any more push back would, I think, be out of left field. based on Ellie like having this one moment of like you should go back but no we're together.

I feel like the concept of protecting babies and like protecting a pregnant woman, it's just different. You know what I mean?

And I think they do a good job here of, you know, Ella's reaction of, \"Oh, we're I'm going to be a father, right?\" Like, I think that excitement that Ellie's playing this as is, yeah, going to be very like, I guess, effective of where we're going to see that go when she has that moment with I forget the the character's name.

We didn't do anything like that to get there where we are now and have it again mean that like well we didn't because they actually are such a bigger a grander threat than they are in the video game. everything is a grander threat that I think that's what makes that me moment here at the end of the episode even more powerful or it's funny because Jen was watching last night she's like if I didn't know everything this is where I'd be like that's unbelievable where it is the together and they look out across a war zone to see the building they need to get to where it's like you the way they've set stakes for me as a viewer watching I'm like damn",

Um, when they're in that stuff when you see the smoke grenades come in and there's like an organization that they have, right? Like they are this is military like they now see that and I think that sets the stage very interesting where I I I think you are going to see it as as this underdog thing, right?

I feel like it's like she jumps like from the journey to Seattle. It feels different than how they're presenting it in the show. I do think in the show we're that it's gonna be the Norah moment that I think especially now well you guys didn't watch the [\u00a0__\u00a0] next time because whatever but I did. Okay, cool.

And I was gonna be let down with the Nora situation because I do think that the spores in that scenario make it so much scarier and like more visceral. Um but this episode proved that you don't need them because the Dena turn of the bite and all that stuff work just as well. Um but yeah, I think that uh in the episode where she kills Norah, like I think that's going to be blood, lust, and anger to a degree that you can't return from. I feel like that's when it's",

Like this has all been the the prelude to actually getting there and that's why she you know I think that's when we see the Ellie that we saw at the kitchen table when she whispered Abby, right? Like I would I will re I rewatched last week's episode again because Jen hadn't seen it because of how we reviewed. And so like again that's for me one of the most powerful understated moments from Bella Ramsayy's performance so far of just like in the girl with the braid Abby Abby like she just says it in a way of like I have been it's just all told with the voice and the look of like I have been questing for that one piece of information",

Uh we got some super chats. CJ Splitzson says how do we feel about the lack of Tommy in Seattle? I still think we'll get there. I think so too.

You're you're more actively in control and you the person is making decisions of how to go about things. whereas uh pairing her with Dena who does seem a lot more uh strategic and understanding of like how this is all going to go. I like the concept of them being this team and what happens when they're separated and what happens when Ellie is then going too far both because of anger or whatever and doesn't have somebody to not just pull her back but also like allow her to stop and think about her actions. And I think that's where we can easily get back on track, quote unquote, to where the story needs to get in terms of Ellie's choices and actions or lack thereof thought process turning into disaster for everybody around her.",

Yeah. I mean, do you I guess a bigger question here is do you see them altering from the video game story in a major way for like character fates and stuff? Cuz I could also see in the way that we're talking about Ellie and Dena in their relationship and what Dena does for Ellie and Ellie getting in like what pushes Ellie to blind rage mode in the way that we're talking about like oh maybe Ellie doesn't kill Mel or something like that, right? Like could it be that Dena gets killed also by one of the wolves people or by Abby and that is like the thing to really send Ellie? I will be incredibly upset if they kill Dena. Yeah, I think that that will be a bridge too far for me that I'm like I don't think that that's a difference that I don't think they can back up. I don't think there's any",

I don't think there's any way they can tell a story that that's the right choice. Like I feel that would be just for shock for shock sake and all that cuz I think getting to the end of the game like really the theme of the Last of Us 2 and the core story of it all I think it's important that Dena and the kid live like I think that is so and that and that Ellie makes be with them around. Yeah. Yeah. I really hope that that's not the case. Yeah, I don't think No, I don't think that'll happen. I think there's two reasons. One's the weakest. The second's the strongest, I think.

Did you ever watch uh a [\u00a0__\u00a0] The Claw, right? What is that? the the wrestling movie. Tim, I need your help. The wrestling movie. It's the claw, right? Ironclaw. Ironclaw. Thank you so much. Did you ever watch Ironclaw? Yeah, I watched Ironclaw. Cried through Ironclaw. Claw. What a great movie. And then reading about it afterwards cuz I know about the Von Eric family obviously through pro wrestling, but reading about it and finding out that there was another brother that they just didn't put in the movie. And it's another brother who also had a very shitty end like the other brothers in that movie. And they in one of the interviews with the writer/director, whatever",

Like, it's just like you can only take so much.\" And I think if you were to bookend this season with like Joel dies and then so does Dena, like I think you'd lose everybody and it would just And then it would also be completely unbeliev What's Ellie's journey from there, right, of just being like the coldarted murderer, but also like nothing to live for. Yeah. But it's cuz she has something to lose and she loses it and we see her lose it and come back to it, right? Like that's why it's so powerful.

I I do too. I do too. Yeah. Uh well everyone, let us know in the comments what you thought of this episode of The Last of Us and uh who you think's going to die in the future of this show. Um stay tuned. We're about to do a Cyberpunk 2077 stream and then after that, Alien Covenant in review. Until next time, love y'all. Goodbye.",
