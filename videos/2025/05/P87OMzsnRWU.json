Anything that's not a cut scene, we will walk. Like I think 10 hours or 22 hours. 10 or 20. What? That's a wide margin. It is. But if he makes it past 10, he's making it to 22. I like that.

Two hot bodies as you said. Roger going to be very exciting to see and you get all the vibes you want. All the crime vibes or vibes that you want from, you know, bad boys in Miami down there. Some Fast and Furious scenes. I can't wait to dive in. You got the cops of course, but there's so much more to dive into. We saw a football jersey.

This is what like when I start to see smaller things, it's building into what people are really going to spend a lot of time with, which is that life sim that has become GTA online. And so now they give you the freedom of, hey, bless and Mike, you can build your character, sure, however you want. Or we can give you the freedom.

Dude, there's going to be moments where you're going to pull into a neighborhood. So, like, if you've ever been to Florida, you've seen it before. Like, we're going to have Miami Beach, which is nice, right? We're going to get the Everglades, which is going to be your wild area that you're going to be out on the jet or the fan boats. But there are neighborhoods that are nestled right by the like the water of the lakes and the rivers and they kind of have like small little canals through them. You're going to see some lady walking her dog alligator come up. [\u00a0__\u00a0] grab a hold of that dog. It's going to be wild. She'll be scraping, you'll be tick- tocking it. And then Yeah.

Um I mean, speaking of being from Florida, Stake Stakes animation writes in and says, \"As someone from Florida, Jason definitely looks like someone who would scream a slur at you as he speeds away in his lifted and his lifted F-150. They nailed the accuracy. I've never believed more that Jason is a cop. Like you are 1,000% correct that he is an undercover cop. Yeah.
