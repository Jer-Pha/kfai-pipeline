I will get into all of that uh once we do more of our super chat section, but the gist of a lot of the questions is will this work after a really really uh chaotic weekend. Um story goes like this. Chaos has engulfed Bungie after an artist anti-real came forward to accuse Bungie of ripping off her 2017 work as its upcoming extraction shooter marathon was starting to take shape as early as 2018. Bungie admitted to the plagiarism supposedly uh supposedly the work of one ex artist and supposedly the work of sorry I re I read that incorrectly and promised to make things right but the sore gained traction among gaming outlets and reaction streamers alike and it's poisoned the previous positive conversation about the aesthetic of the game.

I've spoken to some current and former Bungie employees uh and their excuse for the art theft sto studio morale, the possibility of a delay, and some very real changes when it comes to the upcoming presentation and play testing of the game. Here's what I've learned. The public explanation for the art theft one ex employee taking things in 2020 is the same one being given internally at Bungie among the rank and file. Sony and Bungie legal are now sorting through this and there is unlikely to be much new information as all of uh this continues to unfold. It's not clear how long an audit will take of the assets to remove or find any more plagiarism as it's an expansive enough process to have Bungie not even show any footage at all in its recent live stream.

Everybody has the same concerns about what happens to Bungie as a studio if Marathon bombs, which is something they absolutely cannot afford. There are even hints or jokes about a delay about the September release uh date internally. With that said, it is entirely possible, if not likely, those conversations are happening privately between higherup Sony and Bungie leadership. It's unclear what the plan to launch the game is in a quote now actively hostile environment unquote just a few months from now or how to turn that around. Some changes to future plans have been made even before this new plagiarism development mainly as a reaction to gameplay footage and now the closed alpha.

We're talking about how uh Marathon and the future plans are likely changing. So, welcome back everybody. Sorry about that little PC blue screen issue, but Barrett on the case popping off doing his darnest. Um, let's continue. This is of course from Paul Tassy at Forbes. Article about Marathon about the art theft, all that junk, uh, including the game just, you know, may not be in a great spot. And a lot of the devs may feel similarly.

And as far back as 5 years ago, devs are telling them what would and wouldn't work and were often ignored. Many have said previously that it needed more that it needed to have some sort of a PVE component. All of this between necessary asset auditing, a reworked marketing campaign, and shifting play test plans screams of a game that is not coming out in 4 months or at the very least shouldn't be, though there are no indicators of that yet. Whole lot to break down here, Mike. Shout out to Paulassi for that fantastic article. We saw all this drama kind of unfolding live over the weekend.

Mike, what are your thoughts on Marathon's future, the start of Marathon? Um, I mean, I guess we could start maybe from the art asset portion of it.

I also just think it's incredibly tough because it's one thing to really be into somebody's style. You know, when you get together, you kind of figure out what influence in influences can we pull from? What are things we're vibing with? What do we think the game can look like?

No, it's like we are seeing the same words being put in little decals around the world. And um yeah, you got to feel terrible for anti-real, but I think on the more positive side, Bungie saying, \"Hey, we obviously don't stand by this and we want to we will do right by the artist, whatever that means.\" I don't I think that's a good sign so far. I hope they are really really done well and I hope that they are compensated for a lot of what has has happened to them because again this this game's whole aesthetic can def has definitely pulled from a lot of different influences but a lot of them can be traced to anti-real and not to say that anti-real is extremely that this is the first time we've ever seen",

I saw people like Paul Tassy posting on on Blue Sky and Twitter, not trying to be, you know, doom and gloom about it, but posting the often seen Steam Concurrence and seeing 700 people playing and saying, \"Hey, obviously not a great look, but put out more invites, right?

Um, now you as as somebody, you know, we've been playing Hunt Showdown recently, Mike, we've been playing, you got really into Tarov with Nick. Where do you see that Bungie can kind of improve upon what the Marathon Marathon closed beta was? Yeah, I think Bungie needs some work here for Marathon and I think most importantly, I don't think we'll see this in September. I do think we'll see this get delayed here.

I think what we were building up for was a summer gamefest, like big blowout, probably a beta right after that as we lead into September. So I think with the vibes being off within the studio, of course now nobody probably wants to walk into that studio and have a really positive mindset of what's going on right now until the vibes are fixed. But that would have been the leadup, right? So now this whole road map is probably thrown off. So I expect this game to be delayed until probably 2026. The issue is is now you have Grand Theft Auto looming in May and so your window gets a little bit tighter to keep player retention, keep all eyes on you. With Arc Raiders, we still have the question mark of when you have a game like Exoborn. When, right?

Now, that's going to be a major thing. How do they change that? How do they fix that? The gunplay was Bungie, right? It felt good to play. The character classes I thought all had unique abilities that played into the mix there, but there was something missing in that gameplay that wasn't up to snuff with what it's going to be competing against.

Like there was pretty limited NPC battles, but the NPCs were a lot tougher than any other extraction shooter that I've encountered where that led to gameplay of going, \"Oh man, I can't do this alone. I need my team and also if I engage with these bots right now, I'm going to be opened up for a third party attack at any moment.

And I wonder what is going to be the main driver of that cuz whenever you try to put on live captions on your phone, your phone will tell you, \"Hey, this is going to drain the battery faster.\" Okay. Obviously, we're not dealing with a battery issue, but we are dealing with a power output uh issue. And I got to assume that they kind of have a lot of that already prepared.
