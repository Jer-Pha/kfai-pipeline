HBO's The Last of Us season 2 finale aired to half the audience that tuned in to the season 1 finale of the video game adaptation as Sunday's season closer saw 3.7 million crossplatform viewers. That's down 55% from the finale from the season 1 finale, which scored 8.2 million crossplatform viewers. then an impressive feat given that it aired of opposite the Oscars. Season 2 premiered to 5.3 million cross-platform viewers. HBO cautions that The Last of Season 2 finale viewership is expected to grow due to low tune-ins on the holiday weekend and stressed that the franchise overall has seen 90 million viewers since season 1 ended.

Star Wars Battlefront 2 smashes alltime Steam numbers bolstered by social media campaign. This is Jordan Midler at Video Games Chronicle. Star Wars Battlefront 2 has beaten its all-time Steam concurrent player numbers 5 years after the game was released on the platform. The game, which has seen a spike in popularity over the last week due to a social media campaign from fans attempting to revitalize interest in the series, saw 18,635 players on Steam on Monday. The highest number of concurrent players achieved on the platform since it was released. Before this week, the highest the peak had ever reached on Steam was 10,489 back in January 2021, meaning the new record has nearly doubled that. The game also reappeared on the list of Steam's 25 top selling titles, suggesting that the social media campaign has recruited new players as opposed to",

Mike, how you feel about that? Yeah, here's a fun one for you, Bless. This is a cool one coming out of the weekend. I know a couple of my friends have jumped back in and are riding the high off of whatever this Star Wars fever is. I mean, of course, we know May the 4th is always kind of the pump up of more Star Wars in your life as you go through, no matter where you're at. It's like May the 4th happens, you put the movies back in theaters, you get some sort of Star Wars content on video games, and people want to jump back into the fun.

And if you want more, here's a good game for you to play, right? And so if we rewound time and we talked about the microtransactions and all of that when the fir when the game first came out, it'd be something. But like Battlefront at its core is still a very good game. Yeah. Have you been watching Star Wars andor? No. Cuz the streets are [\u00a0__\u00a0] with it. Let me tell you. Streets are [\u00a0__\u00a0] the streets [\u00a0__\u00a0] with season one of course. I mean you build off of Vandor as well for the hype. You want to play a video game. There you go. Yeah.

Either way, good for y'all, right? Like, do you I are you somebody first of all, how much Battlefront did you play? And then also, do you think this leads into possibly a resurgence enough for us to get a Battlefront 3? No, I don't think we will have enough.

Like that is a fun time for anyone whether it be the hardcore firstperson audience, first-person shooter audience or just the casual audience that wants a Star Wars experience. It's awesome, right? You get to be a stormtrooper running around with hundreds of other players. There's X-wings flying over your head. You're on this giant behemoth of a map running around.

I I don't think is it an EA thing? Yeah. I mean, well, they got to figure out Battlefield first, right?

That's my thing is I think from the Disney side, Disney seems to always be down for Star Wars games, right? They always want that to be out in the ether.

I would be so fascinated to see if that turns into people being like, \"Yeah, where's three at? Like, give us three. Like, we want Battlefront 3.\" And how much of that then can translate into EA and Disney talking being like the numbers speak for themselves like we got to give them what they want cuz do you what all a question I'll ask you right what is the potential for the next Battlefield numbers versus the next Battlefront numbers like is is Battlefield is Battlefield like a given that is always going to sell more than a Battlefront or be more popular?

And so what I was going to pitch you on is like why don't we focus on the Battlefield right now and try to nail that in this next one to two years and then after that have the next cycle of hey let's switch the Battlefront, right? Kind of have that on and off situation going on right now because I do think both are bringing in the exact same if you really look at it, right? My question to you would be like, do you really think all these companies have proven they want one thing and they want that reoccurring bill? They want people to come in and give them more money each and every day. They want you to come in and give them your time. And I just don't see Battlefield and",

They're going to get you one to two years success and then it falls off, right? And so I don't think EA right now is looking at that going, we're greenlighting a one to twoyear winner. we want something bigger. We want that, right? And everybody points to Fortnite and all those other games. And so I think you live in a world where they're probably hesitant to do that, especially after the ba last reception of Battlefield, which wasn't positive.

Always going to Could you Could you also make a like like a single player Mortal Kombat like action game?\" Well, I mean tried it before. That's what I was going to get to you with you. It's like Mortal Kombat to me has always been great because of that single player campaign, right? I don't see many others doing it like that, right? With the big time over-the-top story. I think others do a good single player campaign, but Mortal Kombat for the casual audience is the one to go jump into and get lost in. Is there something where you could What was the one bless that",
