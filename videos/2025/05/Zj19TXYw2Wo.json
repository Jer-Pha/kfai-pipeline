Um Legend of Zelda, the Hyrule Warriors. Oh yeah, I forgot the name of Age of Imprisonment. No, you guys know what I'm talking about. The one where you play as Zelda. Yeah, that we don't know. That's what it's called. but that's a 2025 and we don't have a date for that one yet and u there was a couple others. So we're we still have the some open spaces but we know that there's games to fill those spaces. So at this point I'm not expecting any more giant games of consequence from Nintendo to be announced for 2025. Okay. But there is always room, right? there is the potential that Metroid being a December game would not be out of the realm of possibility for how Nintendo treats Metroid uh and how they they think about that game. And now that we know without a shadow of a doubt it is a crossgen game that you can buy",

Um but yeah, all that is very exciting to me and uh this being October I I prefer that than November. There there's something about getting this one on the sooner end I feel is going to be really good. I want to give Metroid as much time to cook as possible. Not that we're really talking about that much time, but I I still think even more marketing. We need Metroid Prime 4 to have as much done, right, to help it succeed as possible. Yeah.

So, yeah, that makes sense, too, especially if you're trying to get people to make that jump from the Switch one to the Switch 2 that uh I think for a lot of people is a no-brainer.

And especially when you're talking about a console that helped so many people through the pandemic and all you got to do is like dangle some shiny keys in front of them to get them to to jump up.

They're always kind of playing catch-up in a classic Apple fashion when it comes to a lot of these uh technologies and ecosystems, but we are in a different place now.

So, stop right there and talk a little bit about the Apple TV box and why this is a great starting point, why if you're serious, you should do it.

When asked for an exact number of individuals impacted, EA declined to comment. Aian understands the total number of affected individuals in this wake wave, I'm sorry, is less than the roughly 300 roles cut last month across Respawn and EA's fan care teams, but cannot confirm by how much.

As with the past round of layoffs, EA is endeavoring to place affected individuals in other roles across the company. The company has made use of its placement program with each round of layoffs in recent years, an effort that remains possible despite the constant team cuts likely due to EA seemingly drastically increasing headcount on other teams at the same time. Per Game Files reporting, EA employed 800 more people as of March of this year than it did in the same time in 2024. To that end, Melee's email continues, \"The company is focusing on a small handful of franchises going forward. Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends.

The email doesn't mention EA Sports, but this is due to Melee running uh EA Entertainment, while EA Sports is a separate division.

Uh these cuts come on the heels of multiple other rounds of layoffs and cancellations at EA over the last few years, especially in 2025. Just last last month, EA laid off roughly 300 individuals, including around 100 at Respawn while canceling an indevelopment Titanfall game in another incubation project. Earlier this year, EA restructured Boware, giving some developers to other projects and laying off others.

When Elden Ring Night Reign is played exactly as it was designed to be played, it's one of the finest examples of a three-player co-op game around.

And if you want to play by yourself, I can't recommend it because of the poor solo match balancing. So yeah, whatever. All of this amounts to an ambitious spin-off that's exhilarating when you're able to create the proper conditions and one that quickly flips to incredibly frustrating when you're not.
