The hunt for Red October begins. Yeah. Yeah, that's it right there. For Lugia begin for Lugia. We are on the back nine of this game. We have Mike has assured me we have 10 to 15 minutes left of play of this game and we are going to finish it today before 5:00 pm where all of us are going to unceremoniously go home. I've had so much anxiety coming back to this world. For a second I was like maybe they just thought maybe they forgot that we didn't finish this game. You were hoping the audience would be like oh we never played Pok\u00e9mon. I was trying so hard to make Tarov entertaining for them. and you try so that they would revolt against us coming back to Pok\u00e9mon. Never have to play this again. There was a small uprise. People started to like it. Yeah. And they did. We were winning them over. Yeah. We're going to get it back. We're",

Is that Fire Red had a difficulty curve that went like this. A nice, you know, little little bell curve, but not too crazy. Not too crazy. Upward like, you know, a little slog. Yeah.

We were fighting level 23 Pok\u00e9mons were the highest Pokemons we were encountering and we were level 35 and beyond. So, it wasn't really uh fun to watch. It was a lot of grinding and so I grinded a lot for Nick and then Andy came in and said, \"Mike, let me help you.\" And Andy gave us a bunch of rare candies.

So, if this sounds cool to you, make sure you wishlist it. Imperial is a complex, featurerich action RPG where you'll be sent to a planet in a far-off corner of the galaxy to explore an imposing monolith. As an elite mercenary, you'll join the expedition tasked with unearthing the secrets of the monolith and face off against the deadly automatons within. In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith. Accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams. Each cardoggram affects which enemies.

Imperial features three weapon archetypes: the fast-paced acrobatic glaive, the defense focused mason shield, or the devastating cannon with a range of customizable skills and abilities that can make short work of the awaiting automatons. Your weapons and abilities can be changed before any excursion into a cardoggram. So, if a loadout isn't working for you, you can mix things up to create the perfect play style.
