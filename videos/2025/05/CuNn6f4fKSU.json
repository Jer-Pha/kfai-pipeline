French President Emmanuel Macarron has praised Clare Obscure Expedition 33 for its success. The game's official Instagram page posted a bilingual message on Thursday thanking players and referring to the game's French heritage. What a crazy week. Thank you to everyone. It's been 7 days since we launched Clare Obscure Expedition 33. What a pleasure it's been to see players from all over the world experiencing the game. We hope you've we hope you enjoyed spotting the nods to our home country throughout. We're proud to share this adventure with you. Uh so subtle. I'm sorry. I mean interrupt the subtle nods to France. Sorry. I'm sorry. Keep going. That's hilarious.

Uh the game was released on April 24th, has enjoyed widespread critical appeal with a Metacritic score currently standing at 93. Uh the game sold more than 500,000 copies in its first 24 hours and 2 days later past the million units shipped milestone. This number doesn't even take into account any of the Game Pass stuff. Jeff, are you playing Expedition? I am. And uh I was I played the the preview build that they sent out a few months ago and immediately I was like, \"Yep, yep. This is it.

As an elite mercenary, you'll join the expedition tasked with unearthing the secrets of the monolith and face off against the deadly automatons within.

Find even more cardigrams to explore by looting defeated enemies, or buy them from other players online at the trading post. You'll need to make sure you have the right gear to take on the harder cardigrams. Build your mercenary, choose your gear, master your abilities, and take down everything in your path in Imperial.

I don't like this era of Sack Boy eraser. Uh once upon a time, Sack Boy was the golden child of PlayStation, becoming a mascot for the brand in much the same way Sonic is associated with Sega and Mario represents Nintendo. I wouldn't go that far, but I appreciate the sentiment. Uh, now, however, Sack Boy hasn't starred in a PlayStation game since 2020 is delightful. Sack Boy, A Big Adventure.

Yes, they there is they found ways to bring Sack Boy back even without Media Molecule. But um I just don't think that that is what PlayStation is right now. they are a different company like they are focused on uh more mature games, more broadly appealing games in their opinion and um I think Sack Boy just doesn't necessarily factor into that.
