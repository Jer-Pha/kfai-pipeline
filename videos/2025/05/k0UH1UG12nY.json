Um you know that Sawyer is coming back now. He's got a new HBO show. What's Sawyer's new show? I don't know. It's an ice duster. I think it was I saw a preview for it on the uh before this episode. Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, we got the Peacemaker trailer was awesome. Peacemaker also. Oh, see I only pay for one. I guess I only get one ad.

I I feel like I am on a different planet when it comes to this show, this season, and even like this episode, just from the discourse that I've seen of like how upset people seem to be or just how like eh they seem to be. I really thoroughly enjoyed this episode for kind of uh the counter to what Nick's even saying here of like I enjoyed how it um portrayed the gameplay elements where you are kind of just walking around Seattle, walking through the the bushes with the the Sarapites attacking the whole um hospital sequence.

Don't get offended. I love you for that. I was like a so it's just good stuff and like I think that they introduced the stalkers in the perfect way and they introduced the um the dark side of the Sarafites. Like we we saw the torture scene last week which obviously is very messed up but we've seen torture before. We've seen Joel do it. Our hero do that, right? or antagonist at the very or at the very least and the way that we see them like stealth mode actually hiding now they're as a group together and seeing this like essentially public execution for this religion I think it just really like raised the stakes",

I loved the the set and um the not a perfect episode. I do think the the hospital stuff went a little fast um in terms of like the chasing down Nora part of it. Like her the getting into the hospital and chasing down Norah like in the game I think felt a little bit more well paced, I guess. Um, but I think that the introduction of Jesse made up for all of that to me where I thought they did such a good job of making him seem like, oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] like he came and saved the day and like it was one of those TV moments where Gia next to me who does not know what's going on uh in the story that happened.

Um, so I was really really into all of that stuff and uh I just think that the the way that they they get to the the end of this episode and and this portrayal of Ellie and Nora and how that all goes down and the introduction of the spores I've been so concerned about. We've been talking about this like last couple months of like seems like from the trailer they're introducing spores. They didn't do that in the first season. Definitely a clear choice to get rid of them. Why would they add them back now? And more importantly, how are they going to make that make sense and make that feel like a good choice?

And the way that these characters know about the spores and that Norah is talking like realizing what's happening and thinking Ellie's [\u00a0__\u00a0] but realizing that she's the the immune one. Like all that stuff was so great because of the opening of this episode of the woman smoking the cigarette and getting that hands-on experience of like I was there and I saw what happened to my son. Yeah, they did such a great job of making the spores terrifying. And I know that sounds stupid because of course that would be terrifying in real life, but the way like the person who over here they were saying the person isn't the cop from Daredevil.

And somebody said, \"Wait, was that woman a waitress?\" I meant I thought I said waiting. I mean waiting. The Ryan Reynolds waiting to say waiting. Okay, just make sure. Anyways, um they do such a great job of introducing a brand new concept and then showing two characters who shouldn't be scared of [\u00a0__\u00a0] Let alone like when she's smoking right and the woman walks in like I thought they send Isaac and Isaac's going to come if you get killed, right? Like I'm here. He's going to be there to execute you. Like okay, cool. They're both unsure of what's going on. when they establish the stuff and then it's like the sealed it up that was the thing my son they it's such a great like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] moment of like yeah that would be terrifying what does it actually mean",

And I think just kind of I don't know if grounds is the right word, but I think centers uh the actual threats of the Cortiseps in the show in a way that I think really enhances this version of the plot. Right. Because I think this is something the conversation I've had with multiple people now of like this discrepancy of what we would do in these scenarios versus what these characters who are literally born into this world would do in these scenarios to to see in their eyes through their eyes I should say both the infected themselves and the spores the the threat level up to a place of oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] we've never been here before.

This big rectangular thing that we have to sneak away from.\" And she's like, \"Well, you know, there be some clickers and well, whatever. We'll figure it out.\" And then we have that crazy I think it might have been actually the episode prior where you have Dena counting. Yeah. And then she gets to five and by the time she gets to three, she's like, \"We're screwed.\" Yeah. So, I like that they have those baked in escalations, but I do think the I think the spores really do have it.

I love I love that they're really sort of fleshing out the wolves, like the actual sex that you're getting to see. I think that's a really smart move, and I think you have to do that because I think I'm I'm fascinated by the wolves now. I want to know more about them. And I know we got to see we got to see Abby more in the game, but still like this could be Jeffrey Wright's story and I would watch another seven episodes of it. Yeah.

They're should they're making it believable of how they're going to do it. Like they are tactically getting the information and they're the information is being given to them because of the overconfidence in uh the WLF. Like I think that's great.

My parent my sister and mom got killed. What I would It doesn't matter.

But on top of that, immediately Ellie trusts Jesse to take care of Dena. And when Ellie has the opportunity to leave them and go after her target Nora in the hospital, she does that immediately. And that feels very like what the hell? That's not what this entire episode just builds up to of we're in this together and all this stuff. But also, it just shows she trusts Jesse that way. And I think that it there's a lot there that I I'm going to be fascinated with knowing how the rest of the game goes and Dena's uh story with Ellie.

And so the idea is how far into the void do we want to go with this? And I liked that scene where she's like, \"Yeah, we're already in for a penny, in for a pound here, right?\" Like, and they had they had that conversation. And then Jesse has that a good moment where, you know, Ellie tries to kind of being the crazy one, being the more brash one, say, \"Hey, we had it covered.\" And he goes, \"Until?\" Until you didn't. And she goes, and then she has to even she has to give and she goes, \"Yeah, until we didn't.\" Right. So,",

You just know by watching it, let alone how cool the theater is and she looks up at the glass as she walks in. Really dumb idea to turn on all the lights in this theater that I don't think I ever in the game would have clocked cuz you're in the video game, you do the objective, you move on here.

She's like, \"Oh, it's propane, natural gas down there.\" Ah. Oh, okay. Jeez, I missed that whole I missed that whole section. That's what you were doing. You're on your own. I liked uh Dena like making the maps uh in the beginning of the episode. And she being a huge nerd is great. Wanting a protractor is great. Using the straight edge of a magazine for your pistol. That's dope. Yeah, super is. But I I just love that again from the the translating gameplay stuff too.

Like I I don't disagree with that where this needs to handle so much of setting up location location of the Sarapites forest and the the hospital and like getting to the hospital and all of that that I think that the a lot of the in the game I don't even think needs to be explicitly said over and over just because you're out there shooting things that feels more violent and feels more vengeful than the the story in the show has. Especially when there's an anger to Ellie the entire way through in the game. Like she fights with Dina when she finds out she's pregnant. She's angry. She gets to Nora. She kills so many people in the hospital. The show instead having it be she gets to Nora and that moment I thought hits not harder but",

The show instead having it be she gets to Nora and that moment I thought hits not harder but differently very hard because it goes from zero to 60. Right. Yes. I think you're 100% correct. And I think again this is us maybe the downside of being a gamer watching this is that we come in with our preconceived notions of what our journey as Ellie was. Uh I think this is a different journey for Ellie. I think uh Bella Ramsey's Ellie as we've talked about multiple times is a different version of Ellie in general. And so I think what they're trying to do and I don't know Nick you are more trained in the craft of screenwriting and making things but it's the idea here that okay we want you the viewer to almost forget at times why you're on this journey so that when we make a turn like this with Nora and we see Ellie go off the deep end and whail on her legs just like we saw Joel do in season",

Right. You need to be reminded of what is at stake here. And again, I think for what we've now set off on now, I feel like now, much like the Xbox dominoes, the domino on the revenge Ellie has fallen. And so, I think when she goes back to Dena, she's going to be a different Ellie, like she was in the game, if you remember when she came back after finding Nora. Like, I think that's important. And I think we keep week to week questioning motivations that'll make more sense when it's an entire season, let alone another season on top of that. Yeah, I do think it's hard though.

And again, my memory of the game is very very very like loose. So I'm sure there were those moments of levity. Um, but I do feel like I think the story I think you get more to to the commenter's point. I do think it is more belabored and more of a a sort of albatross at a certain point than it is being than it is here. Here it just seems like there I mean it's day two and we it almost feels like the season I mean season's almost done, right?

We have to tell it in such a way where we don't have the person able to literally physically pick up a controller and play through these moments and get the enjoyment out of that. So, we do have to have those other, you know, we have to sandwich in a lot of other moments with other characters here. But um I don't I think that I will I will be happy if Bella plays it more quiet rage from here on out or building rage from here on out because I do think there was there's there elements of of the show that I don't love and those elements are when I feel like they should just have when they have those moments of hey we're just kicking it and they look how beautiful we",

And so, I always felt like in the game they did such a great job of being like the second they could have those those feelings, something would interrupt, there'd be a big thing or this and this and this.

It matters. You you as the player, you as the audience, like me as the audience, I'm looking at this woman who had to make this horrible choice and then let her son just basically die in this basement.

You kept talking about hung and that didn't help me. So, you need to look yourself in the mirror. Hey, look yourself in the mirror, CJ. Look yourself in the mirror, everyone. Look yourself in the mirror. Thank you so much for joining us for this breakdown of Last of Us. The next two weeks, we will return. Of course, we're also doing our weekly Andor screencasts. Uh, next week is this week is the final one. That's crazy. The end of Andor forever. I am very sad to see it go. But come hang out with us on Friday as me, Carboni, Sage, and Barrett, Courtney all get together to give our thoughts on that. Or I thought for a second I",

And make every choice which is it going to be. Make up your [\u00a0__\u00a0] choice. Look yourself in the mirror Tim. Stay tuned. We're about to have Nick play Expedition 33 for the first time. I'm excited to see it, but I'm sick of him. So I don't know that I'm gonna watch it right now. Uh but you probably aren't sick of him. So please check it out. If you're on Twitch, stay where you are. If you're on YouTube, make the jump over to another video. Till next time, I love you all. A goodbye. [Music] Hey, hey. [Music]",
