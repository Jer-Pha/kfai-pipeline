How much time have we got? Uh, I was going to say let's live react, but let's maybe just play the trailer in the background. Watch it as we read through the story that breaks things down. 2K Games and developer Hangar 13 revealed a longer look at gameplay from Mafia: The Old Country on Thursday, showing how the origin story for the Mafia franchise stands apart from the open world organized crime competition. In fact, Hangar 13 is hinting strongly that it has no intent in intentions to make Mafia: The Old Country your next forever game. Instead, the game's creators called The Old Country, quote, \"a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion, and a refined take on the familiar mafia gameplay.\" Hangar 13 President Nick Baines said in a news release that the smaller, more linear approach",

Further reinforcing the smaller, less bloated design of Mafia: The Old Country is this statement from the president of Publisher 2K, David Ismier, who said, quote, \"We think there's a large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments.\" Ismalier is is Mailor said uh that the old country quote can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis end quote. The strongest evidence of Mafia: The Old Country scope is its price. 2K is selling the base game for $49.99. There's a deluxe edition that costs $59.99 and includes a bunch of extras naturally, but the asking price is certainly atypical of AAA game releases in 2025. So, if",

I still hold uh true that the story and the vibe of Mafia 3 is like top tier from the last generation of consoles. The openw worldness of it though was very uninspired and at times bad um a lot of the times bad. But if you shifted through that you got something really special from the studio. Hangar 13, that was their first uh Mafia game uh that they made, right? The other Mafia games were 2K check. Um and so that was a lot of learning from them and they took a lot of, you know, they they built off of a lot of what Mafia 2 was, which was much more open world, a bit more of that GTA kind of vibe.

But Mafia 1, and this is why I highly recommend for people if they want to get a taste of kind of what the scope of this game is probably going to be, especially seeing from these trailers, go play Mafia 1, the uh definitive uh edition, which is the remake of the first Mafia that Hangar 13 worked on. And I think you're going to get clued in on like the scale, the scope, the length of the game. Um, and that remake is also like really freaking good. And that was one that like they brought in new actors for it and all this stuff. Like that is 100% worth your time.

Imperial is a complex, featurerich action RPG where you'll be sent to a planet in a far-off corner of the galaxy to explore an imposing monolith. As an elite mercenary, you'll join the expedition tasked with unearthing the secrets of the monolith and face off against the deadly automatons within. In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith, accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams. Each cardgram affects which enemies, boss fights, and loot will appear when you enter the monolith, so no two excursions will be the same. Find even more cardoggrams to explore by looting defeated enemies, or buy them from other players online at the trading post. Imperial features three weapon archetypes.
