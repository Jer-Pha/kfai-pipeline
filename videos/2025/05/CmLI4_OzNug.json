I was talking to Kevin yesterday during the Doom thing and he was talking about how he used to skateboard and I just don't believe it. I know it. He used to ride a skateboard. Me? He Tim did. Oh, Kevin. No, Kevin. Oh, Kevin, dude. Andy. Kevin used to crush on a skateboard and he wasn't uh skateboarding doing tricks and all that stuff. He used it as transportation, but it's Kevin. So, we've talked about this before, but it's been a long time. Kevin made a custom deck to look like Donatello the Ninja Turtle. All right. Custom grip tape, custom everything, but it had that shape of the like um more like old school Tony Hawk decks. You know what I'm talking about? That like only have the kicker on one side. Okay.

There was a couple times we went to lunch over there as a group. But uh SF State's just all on a giant hill. And Kev would just crush this hill every morning on this skateboard going entirely too fast with entirely way too many people around. It was not acceptable whatsoever. But like he in the same way that Kevin swimming was a thing of beauty. Kevin on this skateboard was like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] Now Kevin mentioned that you ran r Kevin I want to see a video of you skateboarding. Is that correct?

You had your left foot in the back. Right foot kicking and I put it in the front. It's real bad. Weird. I'm a broken person, dude. And because of that, it limited my ability. Like I could not do a lot of stuff because of that. It's like me playing invert.
