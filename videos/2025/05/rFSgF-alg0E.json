According to people with knowledge of the matter, some developers at Haven were concerned about how the game was received and its progress, said the people who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to speak publicly.

You said, \"Yeah, Marvel 1943, right?\" But you still I got I got the parts there. Um that got that got delayed recently to 2026. I still have my hesitations on if that's actually a video game or if it is more of a very glorified tech demo um of a game that is majority like vast majority like way more even than like a Metal Gear Solid 4 cut scenes.

And that's adding on to other games that PlayStation's been uh working on and putting out. Similar to you can't not bring up Concord, right? You can't not bring up Marathon. We'll talk about that even more later. But um fair games I do think is uh one of the ones that most of us kind of like we use as a butt of a joke when we talk about these games, right?

Let us know in chat if you're that person. Is it good? So that is interesting, right? That it actually is being played right now by some uh external people.

Probably gets delayed further. I think if we're that far out from it PlayStation I think it'd be different if Concord didn't happen. If Concord didn't happen, I could see PlayStation being like a we're close enough and we have a team like see it through. If this game, if this is happening weeks after the external play test and they're like, \"Oh, we got to get rid of Jade Raymond.\" This thing from the top down is not looking good. Get rid of it.

And like, I think one of the core issues is that the pitch of Fair Games, I don't think excites us, right? It's a competitive heist game coming to PS5, uh, PC. I'm trying to get deeper into it where they talk about the PVP PVE um aspect of it. Right. Fair games came from the desire to create a new type of PVP game with emergent sandbox gameplay. We want to deliver a fresh multiplayer experience that rewards creativity and mastery and delivers surprising stories each and every time you play. I read that and I go, \"What does that what does any of that mean? You sound like every multiplayer game in existence, right?\" Um and they go",

Like I don't know even aesthetically I look at fair games and I see so many games that kind of give me that same vibe right and like so many games that seem like they're doing it maybe even slightly more comp competently. I look at something like the finals and the finals kind of came and went a little bit but at the very least it seemed like there was a spark in finals that was connecting with people. I just don't as of now I just don't see anything about fair games that is connecting as far as like the marketing of it, the word of mouth of it, like how it fits into the PlayStation ecosystem.

Like I feel like like a lot of what we're talking about here is like that's probably the ideation and just like the uh initial leading of the project. But with how far we're into this now, I assume I mean people play testing it and them even internally having a release date set for within a year of of now. Like I feel like it's too late to just like rip the the cord on this one. Like I feel like it has to come out but what form does it come out in? Right. I think that that's that is interesting. But like, yeah, cuz like I I'm with you as a person that doesn't fully understand the intricacies of where all the money goes with this stuff.

But though, the reason why I bring up Concord happening is specifically how badly Concord performed, right? Like Concord was the was at the point where it's like, \"Oh, just put it out at that point, right? Like you're that far with it. people might the the word of mouth, the pre-orders, all that stuff aren't looking great, but you're there, so just put it out. And they took it off offline in two weeks.

Like I don't know that they have the means to do that at this point. If they do like like I know they did it with Concord backwards, you know, like they they did that after the game launched. Uh doing it before is going to be very very interesting and uh put Sony in a very bad spot. Honestly, I guess like I could see the the conversation being if they weren't thinking freeto play like maybe it is a freetoplay game, right? Like maybe absolutely. I I my worry with fair game so far and you have like a lot of room for marketing and advertising left, right?

And so you got to do whatever you can to get a player base and I think that has to be either free to play, that has to be putting this game on PS+ so that any people that are part of that service can can jump into it. It has to be that. Yeah. Like I I don't think that uh a $40 price tag is an option for this. Oh, absolutely not. Yeah. So, I mean, I feel like we know that. I'm sure that they know that. Will they listen to that or not? That's the big question. But I do think that I would bet that this game is released free to play over it being straight up cancelled. I can see that at this point.

Also, Fair Games sounds like an extraction shooter and they got Marathon coming again.\" I as for that for that second half. Yeah, that that's why I'm like you guys have so much marketing and and convincing to do as far as selling people on on what fair games is because when I read it on paper, I think about so many other games that are out right now that I would probably rather play.

And this is where we're at now of they are trying to make you think extraction shooters, you think about like those PC games that Mike plays on stream. You know what I mean? PlayStation was like, \"Oh, there's money and value there. Let's have it so it's not just third person dad games, right? And big gigantic budget um narrative experiences on PlayStation.

I I would bet it was part of this conversation and I I think that it it being a sequel to Hell Divers and that team wanting to make that and all that stuff.

And that's the thing that I think is tough when it comes to video game directors is like you're part you're part of a team.

But like the reality is that yeah, like Stadia, there's a bunch of Stadia projects that we just didn't see or that got like bought and turned into like other things. I think the Quarry was one of those that ended up as an actual game that came out outside of Stadia. But then I look through I have the Wikipedia open for like for Jade Raven projects, right?

Aside from the fact that a lot of their projects have gotten cancelled, I think Jade Raven for me is just a name I hear because she's happened to have like directed stuff that was popular at Ubisoft in an era, but like I'm not I when she got pulled into PlayStation for this, I wasn't like, \"Oh snap, a new Jade Raymond game.\" Like I Well, I think that might just be a time and place thing for you of just like she was very important.

And the next time something's added, the expectation is only going to be higher and higher and higher. So, I do think it's unlikely. I think two things.

And I think that's perfectly fine. I'm not even trying to take anything away from Jade Raymond. It's more of the sense of like cool like you have a a past working on on cool games.

It's a moot point because at the end of the day, it's like I'm with you. It's like I'm not looking forward to a Jade Raymond thing and it just does kind of feel like a butt of a joke at this point like yeah, this headline was inevitable. And I think to ultimately answer my point with Sam Senell's question, right, of Jade Raymond's track record got to be not great by now, right? My thing is I'm like I don't really care about Jade Raymond's track record to that extent. And as far as it not being great, I think that's true for a lot of people in the industry. Like especially",

It's just the fact that often times, many times in video games, things get canceled, things don't don't come to fruition. And I think Jade Raven just has happens to be a name that we see attached to quite a few things because she has a higher up position.

Earlier this week, Scottish artist Fern Hook posted on social media that her work had appeared in the Marathon Alpha without her knowledge or permission. Quote, \"Its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017,\" Hook wrote on X. In an interview with the Washington Post, Fern says she was suspicious that her art may have been used without her permission when Bungie first revealed the game in 2023. In her thread, Fern posted sideby-side comparisons of her work and what appears in Marathon. She also made a post on Twitter in 2024 saying that she hid a reference to the control out delete web comic loss in her designs.

The studio also said it reached out to Fern to discuss the matter and that it is quote committed to doing right by the artist end quote. This is not the first time an artist's work has been used for a Bungie product without their permission.
