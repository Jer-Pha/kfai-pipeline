Welcome back to my continued playthrough of Doom the Dark Ages or Doom the Old Country as Greg likes to refer to this to. Maybe that's what they're calling it in Italy. Doom the Old Country. Uh, as you guys know, we're here. We're live. We're hanging out for a couple hours probably. And then daddy's got to go see a movie that I'm very excited about. Ooh. If you guys were around for the podcast, let me know what you guys thought about it. Let me know what you think the title of that podcast should be because I floated what I thought my title should be. Don't say it again. And people didn't think it was a good idea. Do not say it again. Hold on a sec. Uh, I'm going to bring the chat up actually. Give me one second. Also, I need to change the title and game. I will do that now. Sorry, chat. I get all mad.

Hypothetically speaking, if I came out of the bathroom when they were trying to figure out what the title is, and I titled the video, when is 911 funny? Is that a bad thing?
