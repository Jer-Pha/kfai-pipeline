Star Wars Battlefront 2 has beaten its all-time Steam concurrent player numbers 5 years after the game was released on the platform. The game, which has seen a spike in popularity over the last week due to a social media campaign from fans attempting to revitalize interest in the series, saw 18,635 players on Steam on Monday. The highest number of concurrent players achieved on the platform since it was released. Before this week, the highest the peak had ever reached on Steam was 10,489 back in January 2021, meaning the new record has nearly doubled that. The game also reappeared on the list of Steam's 25 top selling titles, suggesting that the social media campaign has recruited new players as opposed to simply sparking a resurgence from existing ones. Mike, how you feel about that? Yeah, here's a fun one for you, Bless. This",

Yeah, here's a fun one for you, Bless. This is a cool one coming out of the weekend. I know a couple of my friends have jumped back in and are riding the high off of whatever this Star Wars fever is. I mean, of course, we know May the 4th is always kind of the pump up of more Star Wars in your life as you go through no matter where you're at. It's like May the 4th happens. You put the movies back in theaters. You get some sort of Star Wars content on video games and people want to jump back into the fun. But I mean, this is something I didn't think would ever happen. Bless, but at the core of it, it's like the Battlefront games are great games. They're fun times with your friends. There's something easy to jump in and jump out of, right?

And so if we rewound time and we talked about the microtransactions and all of that when the fir when the game first came out, it'd be something.

Let me The streets [\u00a0__\u00a0] with season one. Of course. I mean, you build off of Andor as well for the hype. You want to play a video game? There you go. Yeah.

Either way, good for y'all, right? Like do you I are you somebody first of all, how much Battlefront did you play? And then also, do you think this leads into possibly a resurgence enough for us to get a Battlefront 3? No, I don't think we will have enough. Now, when I say that, I am someone who rides or dies for Battlefront, right? Like, I'm talking OG Battlefront 1 and two on your PlayStation 2os. I love those games, right?

You get to be a Stormtrooper running around with hundreds of other players. There's X-wings flying over your head. You're on this giant behemoth of a map running around. They have conquest mode just like back in the day with Battlefield where you take one point then you go to the next point.

I I don't think Is it an EA thing? Yeah. I mean, well, they got to figure out Battlefield first, right? like Battlefield's got to come first and then yeah, licensing out with Disney and figuring out where we can come back with that. I think Disney has done a really good job letting others play in the Star Wars universe and letting people get their hands on this IP and other IPs that like have done well. But I mean, it would be hard not for Disney to be like, \"Yeah, you can make another Battlefront, right?\" But EA is also in a spot where it's like EA's like Ubisoft trying to pick a winner here and stick with that right now.

That's my thing is I think from the Disney side, Disney seems to always be down for Star Wars games, right? They always want that to be out in the ether. Like, you know, I a few years ago I put up a blessing show that was all about Star Wars video games and how there's a lineage, right? Like Star Wars as a as is like Star Wars is practically a video game franchise in a lot of ways when you look at like all the different games that have come out. We've had two different Battlefront series over the years come out, right? So, like I think like Disney is always like looking for what's next for that and what makes sense for that. And then from the EA side, right, like I think if there's money in it, I don't see why not. I I understand the thing of, you know, the last I think especially Battlefront 2, you had that rough",

And I totally understand the idea of Disney being like, \"Fuck that. We're not working with them anymore on this thing.\" Like, you know, this is trash. But I think the recover the recovery has been so good, you know, like I I think seeing these player numbers still resurge, right? It reminds me of see of of seeing Skate 3 over time where streamers will play it and then, you know, their audiences will hop in and then you see those Skate 3 numbers sustain so much and then you see the audiences demand for Skate 3 like month after month, year after year to then finally EA's like, \"Fine, we're going to give you we're going to give you the next Skate game.

I would be so fascinated to see if that turns into people being like, \"Yeah, where's three at?\" Like, \"Give us three. Like, we want Battlefront 3.\" And how much of that then can translate into EA and Disney talking being like, \"The numbers speak for themselves. Like, we got to give them what they want.\" Cuz do you what all a question I'll ask you, right? What is the potential for the next Battlefield numbers versus the next Battlefront numbers? Like is is Battlefield is Battlefield like a given that is always going to sell more than a Battlefront or be more popular? No, I think they're pretty close. Bless, right?

And so what I was going to pitch you on is like why don't we focus on the battlefield right now and try to nail that in this next one to two years and then after that have the next cycle of hey let's switch the battlefront right kind of have that on andoff situation going on right now because I do think both are bringing in the exact same if you really look at it right my question to you would be like do you really think all these companies have proven they want one thing and they want that reoccurring bill they want people to come in and give them more money each and every day they want you to come in and give them your time. And I just don't see Battlefield and Battlefront at this moment right now being the big winners. They're going to win, but they're not going to",

They're going to win, but they're not going to get you five years success. They're going to get you one to two years success and then it falls off, right? And so I don't think EA right now is looking at that going, we're greenlighting a one to twoyear winner. We want something bigger. We want that, right? And everybody points to Fortnite and all those other games. And so I think you live in a world where they're probably hesitant to do that, especially after the ba last reception of Battlefield, which wasn't positive. And so it's probably like, hey, nail that and then we probably should lean on Star Wars because I think they're both going to get you the same end result here.

Game came out in 20 or 2023, so it's hitting its 2-year lifespan here and moving on to the next one, right? And so, yeah, I mean, for me, I really liked Mortal Kombat 1.

Maybe we can build off of that, get that kind of excitement and juice going. But at the core of it all, it's still the gameplay, right? And Netherrem, they're great, right?

Injustice is great, but are people going to say, \"Hey, I've been there with the superheroes before. I want something new.\" But really, what is that third option? Is there even something something new with characters that you could even do world building wise or do you have to stick with the two? You know, when you're under WB, I think you have to stick with the two, unfortunately, cuz that's how WB operates.

Like there's something about those characters that really work. And I think that translates to if you wanted to make an action adventure game, let me play as Scorpion or Subzero or Johnny Cage or whoever and just go through a campaign and it's a really violent like third person action thing. Yeah. Almost like a Sefue maybe even like an assassin. Not like big but like Yeah. I want that third person feel running around a Scorpion. Get over here. Dude, you bring up Sefue. You give Slow Clap a Liu Kang game. Oh my god. Would that be cool? That would be cool.

Because MK1's story ended on a weird note where it's like, \"Okay, you guys are obviously going to do DLC for this.\" Um Oh, people are saying they did it with MK1. Let me tell you, I missed it. I didn't miss it. Totally missed out on that. So, like, I wonder if that's a marketing thing or I wonder if that's just like a lack of interest thing. Yeah. Who knows?",
