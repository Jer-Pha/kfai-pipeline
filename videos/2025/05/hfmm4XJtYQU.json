We were now now chat, here's what I'm going to say for you right now is that we didn't actually not have audio. What happened was I asked Barrett to delay the stream just a little bit. Come up with a, you know, an excuse to why we wouldn't go live because I didn't want Mike coming hot out of the gate at 130% anger level. I wanted him to have a little perspective about what we're going to talk about right now because we have an airing of grievances that has to happen in the in the studio right now. We have to air this. Now, Mike, correct me if I'm wrong. Yeah. Yeah. But, uh, are we we're allowed to talk about what Roger did this?

Of of course, Roger, the biggest Nintendo fan in the office. the guy, Roger. And correct me if I'm wrong, Roger does all those really cool deep dives into Zelda for us. Yes, he does.

He was like, \"We need someone here that knows Nintendo.\" So, of course, Roger gets to go. Uh, first off, shout out to Roger and Mike for the incredible marathon stream you guys had last week, which of course solidified your friendship. You said you unblocked him, which was great. I unblocked him. We'll talk about that in a second. You say to Roger, \"Roger, can you please pick me up this specific?\" Yeah. Can I tell you about it? Yeah. I said, \"Roger, you get to go to the Nintendo store.\" And I, oddly enough, wasn't chos chosen. You know, I didn't get the invite. I guess you're the biggest Pikmin fan I know.

I said, \"Roger, this used to be Japanese exclusive. This t-shirt, this nice button-up Pikmin t-shirt. They're selling I saw the tweet that says they're selling it at the San Francisco store. Would you please for me buy this button-up picnic t-shirt because you get to go. I don't. And will you please buy it in a large?

And he said, \"Mike, I love you more than anything. I will make this happen to you.\" Okay. And we just spent 60 hours here in the studio. We worked really hard together. I didn't want to bother him, but I reminded him this morning. I said, \"Don't forget the Pikmin t-shirt in a large, please.\" And he wrote back, \"Yes, sir.\" Like, \"It's on and popping.\" And I was excited until 5 minutes ago when Roger and the team came back from the Nintendo store and Roger handed me something that wasn't this t-shirt.
