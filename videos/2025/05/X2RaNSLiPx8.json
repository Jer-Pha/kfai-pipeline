We are going to something embargo that we can tell you about later. I think actually on our social media it should we already should have up what we're doing but not the details on what we're doing but we'll save it all for there. So it's actually Tuesday May 13th when you see this everybody. Hello I of course am one of your hosts Greg Miller alongside Forbes 30 under 30 aka the second best baby blues aka the married one at Tim Gettys. Let Tim host. How you doing Greg? I'm great. Happy to be here. you know, uh this is uh day one back from PAX East. Uh back from a long weekend with the fam. Uh just trying to get out there and talk about some stuff cuz I can't believe SGF is so close. We're in a crazy spot. So close. You've been in Boston for PAX East.

It's a different different group of people. But having being at the table talking about video games, it's nice. really happy to be back. I'm excited that you're back. Um, but yeah, the the conversations around SGF and the Switch 2 with everyone down in LA, it's like, oh man, fever pitch [\u00a0__\u00a0] Like, we are so close to like gamechanging for me lifechanging things. Having the Nintendo Switch 2, so close. A new Mario Kart, the first Mario Kart in 10 years. Like, oh man. You say fever pitch and you tossed in SGF. Mhm.

No, not at all. And yeah, I I think that uh this year's SGF is there's no reason to look forward to it more or less than any of the Summer Game Fest. Sure. Um the exception to that is the Switch 2. there's a new player on the courts and I think that the potential for Switch 2 announcements uh is I mean it's inevitable, right? We're going to get Switch 2 games to kind of fill out non- Nintendo ones to fill out the the rest of the year. Um so I'm very excited about that. And in in addition that like I just I'm excited for the industry. Like I think that Xbox having a show like Xbox showcase is easily what I'm most excited for at this point.

And uh maybe they'll have a Donkey Kong thing or whatever, but like I don't I'm not expecting a big blowout. We just got that. And uh on the PlayStation side, like who knows? Like will there be a state of play around it? Probably. Um but the Xbox showcase the last couple years has been incredibly banger after banger. Um I think last year's is potentially like one of the greatest showcases we've ever seen. And um like the dominoes have been fallen and a lot of those dominoes were shown at that showcase or um the Maybe not for the first time, but like we we saw games like South of Midnight again and got more information on that and that was where we saw Expedition 33 for the first time to think about and here we're",

I think the Switch 2 launching and Xbox showcase happening at that time. Very exciting for me. I want to see what that looks like cuz I think that Xbox um is continuing to make really interesting moves that are I don't want to say starting to pay off. Um but I feel like they're starting to crystallize in a way where I'm like, \"All right, cool. I I see the vision or there's a vision coming together that was not the vision leading into this. The dominoes did not fall the way that they thought they were going to that they thought they were going to have. I think they're falling in a very positive way and I'm I'm excited for the ride.

Um we have most of the release dates for some of the biggest games announced. Like we already know now when Metal Gear Solid Delta is coming out. So it's not like we're waiting for the release date for that. But there are other games this year that uh I do think we're we're going to hear about that um we've been waiting for. So I am excited.

This is before like we had remote play on on PlayStation but it was very different. Um so even just trying to think of this is obviously a preame pass world where the game subscription service was very different. Uh, in fact, 2015, guess what, Greg? That was a pre- Nintendo Switch world, which means Nintendo was at an all-time low. Things were bad for you, boy. Oh, yeah, they were bad. And you get mad in this episode. Oh, I'm sure.

This would always be the big thing. consoles on their last legs, they're not going to make it. Blah blah blah. And then I say this, has Steam won over and is it now on TVs and you're playing games that way? Indicating of course what I think would become much more ubiquitous with Xbox Game Pass where they're at and all this stuff. And then I toss out the question of is it tablet and mobile based which you can make some it's not but I lob it out there and I think what's interesting let me finish before you go there because I lo it out I think very much in and this is me in 2025 going back and listening to that when I heard it I thought I",

And then I go, \"Is it all tablet and mobile based?\" Colin immediately goes, \"No way.\" And I was like, \"Oh, that's interesting that he didn't think it would be streaming.\" And then as you watch through the episode, no, it's very much Colin talking about tablet and mobile based. So I think present 2025, Greg was looping tablet and mobile into the TV conversation when in fact they they this was at the time 10 years ago a different conversation. It definitely is.

It is there though in a very big way and you can via streaming or just actual dedicated hardware, play a lot of games on many different mobile and tablet devices and many people do that. I think you take it a step further for the conversation though and you look at Steam big picture mode. That to me is a very mobile friendly console focused way to interact with video games on t Steam games, computer games on TV or on other mobile devices. Um, at the end of the day is a tablet-based whatever. Sure, not the number one way that the most people are playing the games that is still consoles. However, the Steam Deck is a gaming tablet. It",

Later on in this episode, you present the question of has Apple entered, is Apple doing a console? Uh, and then from all of us, you know, are they doing a dedicated gaming device? We all say no. None of us think that's going to happen. My quote is I think the time has come and gone uh for that in terms of where Apple was 10 years ago and what they were doing here.

But like I think overall it is a tech that has matured enough to to count as a you should expect it to win instead of having needing a backup.

No. The way we talk about it, it seemed like there was already rumors about it. Oh, really? Okay, maybe I'm wrong then, but uh I thought that that would have come way closer to that 2017 mark of like I don't my memory I wouldn't think it that two plus years out from the Switch launching, I guess two years, uh we'd be talking about it.

The power doesn't matter because like you're saying they're not known for powerful hardware, right?

They did continue to double down on the um uh the bigger ability to play games, but I think that's more of a tech showcase for how powerful the phone is as opposed to like a viable way that they're expecting people to play these games.

We're going to prove it to you.\" And I think that that is uh still being proven currently, but I think that there's a more coherent and believable path forward for them from a community standpoint and from a business standpoint. I think they still have a couple years left of figuring things out and getting all of their major acquisitions in line because it's impossible for um a company to be able to manage Activision and Bethesda and all the Xbox things and whatever else comes uh past that uh without a bunch of issues.

Agreed. I think so much of this is reading the tea leaves, right? And it's evident by Nintendo. Will there be another Nintendo? And then there's a giant conversation that pretty much dominates the rest of the show of what is Nintendo anymore? How close to Nintendo third party publishing are we?

No, I mean, here's the thing. Like the this the I'll make no bones about it. Like the Switch was not an expected hit. Like I I feel like it was looked at as like, okay, we'll see.

Yeah. And now you jump 10 years here to where we are and is again based solely on the fact that as we argue throughout this thing of if Nintendo needs to worry about iterating on hardware, don't worry about that. Iterate with games. The fact that we're talking about Steam in this way is because of the success of the NX which becomes the Nintendo Switch which then leads to the Steam Deck.

At least at this point, trophies are like at this point one of the the final kind of factors on why you would want to play on a on for you PlayStation specific thing.

And they're about to for the over the course of this next year get that onto every single United flight. And that's just where they're starting. I'm sure it's going to go to other flights.

But I do think it is true in terms of how far we need to push sorry how where we need to kind of start the oh a game can be an all-time great in 2025 with this level of technology and I do think it's somewhere around there. If The Last of Us 1 can come out on PlayStation 3 and be remade 15 times on every generation, you can still go back to, well, the game ran and was amazing and looked phenomenal and all of that stuff on the PlayStation 3.

And the answer is yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Across so many different things. I think that there's a lot of just basic tech that has to be uh kept in mind like 4K which is a standard of TVs at this point. So sure you can't get that on um certain consoles and whatever but with where we're at now with the Switch 2 entering the fray with the Steam Deck rising in popularity and the ability to play Steam games in different ways um I think that the base level of game development is going to go back to a better place.
