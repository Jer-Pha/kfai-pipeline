Shout out to Cameron Kennedy, of course, and Carter Herrell on the music. I'm your host, Tim Gettys. I'm joined today by Andy Cortez. Dead Reckoning was two years ago. Yeah, it was two years ago. It came out on July 12th, 2023. This one was supposed to come out June 28th, 2024, but then the strikes and the this and the that's happened. So, here we are now.

Uh, this one has an outrageous budget of close to $400 million due to a lot of re-shoots and having to push production back. And also, Tom Cruz infamously deeply cares about the cast and crews of his movies. So, even when they're not filming during strikes, is paying them full wages. Um, so that explains a lot of the the money there. Um and the budget of the last one was 290 million. So yeah, these are very very very expensive expensive movies.

Andy Cortez, I want to start with you. What did you think of Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning? After not loving Dead Reckoning and feeling like, dang, that was a bit of a letown. Kind of a let down just after many, many, many awesome movies in a row. I This movie started off kind of worrisome. And like in the first 5 minutes or so to 10 minutes to 30 minutes to 40, I'm just like, oh, I don't I'm not I want to love this right now. I'm I want this to be a a a big comeback for after having a movie that didn't quite hit for me with Dead Reckoning.

I talked about it when I was ranking the movies recently. I was debating. Look, I think Mission Impossible 3 is a better complete film front to back. Villain, acting, story, cohesiveness, also really great drama and action and, you know, tension. And it stayed consistent all the way through. And this movie is kind of just like a wet fart in the beginning. And it's like, oh no, we're going to end the franchise on this note. And then it just skyrockets to insane heights.

So, I am I'm just absolutely delighted that by the end by the time this movie ended, I was like, that might have been one of the greatest Mission Impossible movies that I've ever seen. Like, if you shaved off the first hour of it, it might be the greatest Mission Impossible movie ever. It's crazy.

And uh for me, this the first hour of this movie is that just in all the wrong ways. And uh it's really upsetting because they they did what Karate Kid and Cobra Kai does of like literally showing you every single thing that's ever happened and how it all connects, but it lacked the tone or vibe of Cobra Kai, which is silly and over the top and it's cheesy, hilar campy. Um and they they play this as if it's serious and it's not campy and it really really really misses the mark. and the plot that they're rehashing, what they're telling us to set up for this, it's all just like, oh man, we are I I was bored bored bored in a Mission Impossible.

But um something about Dead Reckoning is my heart rate spiked and I had my Apple Watch nine separate times in that movie. Um, I think front to back there's just a lot more action and exciting things going on and the comedic relief and the Haley Atwell dynamics with Tom Cruz. Like there was a lot in Dead Reckoning that this movie just simply doesn't have that I I missed and I wish it did have. But what you guys are saying, there are two separate set pieces that last a very long time in this movie that are better than anything we've seen in any franchise. Like it is top tier stuff.

But in terms of emotional stakes and character stakes, I can't believe how much I didn't care.

Was I at filed for putting Dead Reckoning over three? I don't think you were. You were. I really think you were. You were. Uh, you you were with me, the Dead Reckoning over three, and it was unanimous that Rogue Nation's above Fallout, which is something we're always like, really? That's [\u00a0__\u00a0] crazy. Wow. I'm a Rogue Nation boy. I mean, I love I love majority of these movies. Wow. I can't believe I put Dead Reckoning over three. Um, but because of how the rankings go, this movie is better than This is tough. Tough. This is tough. Okay, so the top three right now, yeah, are better movies completely front to back. Tim, my mind is your mind. What was the big action set",

What was the big action set piece in Rogue Nation? Is that Ethan Hunt? That's Rogue Nation, right? First appearance. That's where they push him into the box. Mhm. And then Ghost Protocol is the out of the plane in the beginning. And Ghost Protocol and that's not the not it's not the Burj Khalifa is Ghost Protocol. Yeah. And that's the one where the fights cobalt at the end on the on the parking structure, right? And you remember like the the the fake hallway imagery where they're sneak. They have the uh what's her name? Leia do where they're like tricking her. They're telling her she's in a different room. Tom Cruz. Tom Cruz has to do that cool thing that mountain climbers do where he like uses his foot. Yeah. All the time. He's always using his foot. Awesome. Um here's my thing. This movie is there.

Half of this movie is the greatest Mission Impossible movie ever [\u00a0__\u00a0] made. But the other half of the movie is just such a slog that I can't in good good faith list it any higher than above Dead Reckoning. I would put this at number four because I enjoyed the hell out of the last two hours of it way more than I enjoyed anything that was in Dead Reckoning. But that movie was a slog for me too. I was very very low on it. I didn't think any of the comedy worked. I didn't like the dynamics of anything. The other three, the top three movies are just start to finish what Mission Impossible movie should be. Granted, are we seeing the best underwater sequence ever? No. But I will gladly take that out to watch any one of those movies on a plane and be just in and just enjoy the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of it from start to finish.",

So, I would rank this number. Our top three right now is fast five through seven. Amen. I would put this in the same spot that Nick is doing uh putting it at number four underneath Ghost Protocol above Dead Reckoning. I also would put it at number four. So, that is where it's going to end up. But I will say it is not as easy for me to say as it sounds like it is for you guys. I think that Dead Reckoning front to back I was more entertained by and there was more things that I was interested in and the characters and the comedy and I liked Palm a lot better in that. I liked Kelly Atwell a lot better in that. But Rebecca Ferguson with the Rebecca Ferguson stuff was [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome. The train sequences at the end. Like I think Dead Reckoning is so much better than it gets",

Like I think Dead Reckoning is so much better than it gets credit for. Um and I think the biggest thing it had going against it was it was a part one. Um, but now that we've seen both of them, I I think that it just it works better than this movie does. But at the end of the day, the submarine sequence and the uh the biplane sequences, they're just that's peak peak Mission Impossible. It's so freaking good. It just sucks that there's another third of the movie that Yeah. And even even within those sequences, those sequences are great, but like surround the glue between them all, it's kind of weak. Uh, dude, there's definitely a cut of this movie that you could make that's two hours, and it's the greatest Mission Impossible movie ever. I mean, I think that there's a three-hour cut between the two movies that that can get there. I I honestly think,",

Let's just [\u00a0__\u00a0] go. Let's just go. Uh, so yeah, there we go. Number four for Dead Reckoning or sorry, the final reckoning. Remember in Dead Reckoning in the in the fourth movie where we were in that airport for like 45 minutes and then every single time you looked up Tom Cruz was just running. Not mad at that. It's weird. One thing I didn't love uh about Dead Reckoning was just like, you know, the whole train sequence. I was like, \"This is all CG.\" Yeah, it's all CG. This isn't real. Yeah, it's the opposite of what we want, dude. I",

Put your life on the line. So, uh, the rankings, uh, potentially for the final time are number one, Rogue Nation, number two, Fallout 3, Ghost Protocol, four, Final Reckoning, five, Dead Reckoning.
