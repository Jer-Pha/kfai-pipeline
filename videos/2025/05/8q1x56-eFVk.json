Do you think we'll get Halfife 3 by the end of this year? Let me know. The latest rumor surrounding Valve's long- aaited next installment in the Half-Life series claims that the game is currently playable endto end and could even be announced in the summer, followed by a release in winter of this year. The speculation comes from Tyler McVicker, who's known for reporting on Valve rumors during his latest Q&A live stream. According to Mick Vicker, the game is currently playable from beginning to end, which he guesses could put it on track for an announcement and release this year. Besides McVicker's hours long live stream, there have been other recent hints about Valve's progress on its highly anticipated title. In March, a Valve concept artist claimed that he was in the room where Valve made Halfife 3 on CG Voic's podcast.",

In March, a Valve concept artist claimed that he was in the room where Valve made Halfife 3 on CG Voic's podcast. In the same month, another Valve leaker, Gabe Follower, claimed that Halflife 3 would be the end of Gordon's Adventure, potentially signaling a non-cliffhanger ending to one of gaming's best franchises. Outside of these rumors, internet sleuths discovered code referencing HLX, which is widely thought to be the code name for HalfLife 3 and major updates to Deadlock and Dota 2. While these rumors are unconfirmed, they are promising signs of HalfLife 3. McVicker said during his live stream that HLX uh won't be another virtual reality game like Halflife Alex and that there are procedural generation features that aren't for terrain generation or rogike mechanics. Greg, huh? Can you believe it? It's got to happen eventually. So yeah, you know what I mean? I think you don't make Halflife Alex no",

You don't make Halflife Alex and have it tie into the Half-Life timeline the way it did and not have some idea for what you're doing next and where you want to go. Valve's always been such an interesting company, right, of just they have ungodly amounts of money. They found so much success with Steam that why ever worry about making games again? They buy up video game developers just to have them never make the game they were making. Like, it's insane over there. Who knows? Um, but no, it doesn't surprise me. You know, it's going to be one of those like it's it doesn't surprise me, but it is shocking that it is still happening that after so much time from Halfife 2. Even from Alex, right?

Again, Alex was a VR title for one VR platform that did what it did, but it's like, is Halflife still a huge deal to a huge deal of gamers? A huge amount of gamers? How I got two two questions and one question. How good does HalfLife 3 need to do to get Valve back into the video game like dev realm more actively? I mean, I don't even think it's possible.

Halflife one comes through changes the game. Halfife 2 comes through changes the game right brings in new types of physics builds people people's minds as far as what the source engine can do all that stuff. Sure.

Yeah, and I hope so. I want revolutionary games. I want things to be amazing. Bringing in a super chat from Peaceful Warhead, will Halfife 3 be announced at SGF or TGA? That would make sense, right? what they're talking about. Jeff is close with Valve, so it would make sense that if they got something to show, they would show it there. And that would be, you talk about a megaton final Jeff doing the thing where he's like, I'm so excited to announce this.

Halfife 3 is the biggest thing you could ever announce. Sure. Like you do not get bigger than that. Or Grand Theft Auto. Or Grand Theft Auto. Yeah, that's a good call.

But let's say it slips that because he's not ready for announcement or whatever it is. Like do you then wait for TJ's to announce it? Like do you as Valve do you just announce it on Twitter?

I'm not talking about the presentation necessarily, right? Jeff has a big thing there.

Do you think that gets in the way of Nintendo's plan of making DK64 available on the Nintendo Switch Online uh app, you know, a big push? Nintendo does have a plan for that. I think they sold it on Wii U and it's just so weird to me. Blessing, how why why I mean this would this would be the way though. That's the thing is I think I would if you were to to lump it in with a rare replay remastered thing or rare replay uh port, I think I prefer that over just Switch online because then you're hopefully getting like bells and whistles and stuff like maybe remap your controls type stuff. You might get like a um what do they call it? Up get it up, maybe a better frame rate. I don't know. What would be interesting for the Fallout New Vegas thing for you is if they were to do what they've done with Oblivion and just remaster it, would that solve the quality of life issues for you?",

Is it is it because it's not strictly a visual thing for you, right? I mean, I think I think it's all of it, right? Like I if if it was a hey, we just visually like remastering this thing and like do small tweaks to the mechanics, I'd be totally down for that. Like I don't need a revamp. I don't need you to like remix New Vegas cuz then you're almost turning it into a different game. I'm down for the core experience that's there. Like I'm down for a visual thing. Piggybacking off of Fable, which I would agree 100%. I would of course jump to Cotor which again I know is we're going to be complicated this that the other but when I think of an Xbox game that I want to see remastered I know we're playing it's just around the corner.

Uh, doing okay says, \"Why isn't Gears Reloaded on Switch 2?\" I don't think you count it out yet. Great question. Yeah, maybe. Like, maybe that's a thing that if it's not ready by August, maybe you get it later on. Maybe maybe you get it next year. Um, trying to think of more Xbox games. Stubs the zombie, of course. Oh, of course. Yeah. What was the one? Oh, Jade Empire was the other boware one. I mean, 9.9 me and Mike kept going back and forth on. You say 9.9. Dave infamously gave it a 9.9 at IGN.
