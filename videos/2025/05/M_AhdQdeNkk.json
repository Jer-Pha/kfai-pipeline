What if there is some type of like And also think about how many people are buying it just for the online. How many people would just jump in only for the online though? Yeah.

And also online, great point. uh John B and VOD online won't be at launch. So you have time to sell this game if you really want to do GTA 6 80 bucks and then $40 for GTA online or if you have GTA 6 it's $30 or $20 or whatever it is, right? You can sell it both two times.

Everyone's going. My My thing remains still that GTA the strategy they had with GTA 5 where it is GTA single player and GTA online made that the best selling video game of all time. I don't think you fix what's broke, what's not broken. I think you just keep with it where it's like, all right, we know how valuable of a package this is.

It's interesting. We're 10 years removed from it, right? So, yeah, they've had a lot of time to think about this. The industry has changed a lot now. And I think the catch is is this is Grand Theft Auto. The name with Rockstar is going to sell no matter what they do.

Is there a better way to attract people or can we try something else that might, you know, generate even more money?\" It's going to generate money no matter",

I think you get a trailer or teaser. And then guess what? This is the way that they justify the $100 price tag or the $80 price tag. They say GTA online is included.

As an elite mercenary, you'll join the expedition tasked with unearthing the secrets of the monolith and face off against the deadly automatons within. In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith. Accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams. Each cardoggram affects which enemies. Boss fights and loot will appear when you enter the monolith, so no two excursions will be the same. Find even more cardoggrams to explore by looting defeated enemies, or buy them from other players online at the trading post.

Yeah, it's May. Oh, I thought it was March. So, it comes out in May and then that puts let's say November PC launch. I can see that cuz that's kind of where we would line up right now if it was going to release this year. Sure. Right. Like the following year, that's a whole year. But it's not released this year. It's not. GTA 6 is going to be the marathon, not the sprint. So, yeah. I could see it being 2027. Everything gets pushed. Everything gets pushed. I could see it being 2028.

GTA is a little bit different because like there's going to be very long legs and you can in you can put things in there, different play styles and servers and stuff that people will pay for longer uh later on. But if you can do that day one, the sooner the better, right? Because then you instill, hey, we're charging for premium Rockstar servers.

Not because uh I think it's just because you're going to want to have get as many people as possible that have consoles and PCs.
