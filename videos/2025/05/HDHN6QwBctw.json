They were just old men who started talking to each other and one of them was putting over SF big. It's like it's getting better year after year. We're really cleaning it up. It's a lot like Detroit.

Uh, I I definitely chose my things based on stuff that I feel like I wasn't going to see elsewhere, right? Because there's certain Nintendo IP where you're like, I can get this at every store, right? Um whereas Pikmin and even Animal Crossing. I feel like Animal Crossing was everywhere for a minute, but there's some Animal Crossing stuff in here that I'm like, I'm not getting that anywhere else.

You know, I think, you know, the stuff people talk about with the New York store for so long of it being like a theme park. It's magical. It's whatever. That's here. You know what I mean? I was super excited to be there today and to walk in not knowing I I've seen photos, of course, iconically.

So, to walk in there, see the statueets, have it be brand new, have it be so much stuff I've never seen in terms of a Nintendo thing, and have that second floor uh filled with other awesome stuff. A bunch, you know, they said the, you know, the usual BS when you start, we want this to be immersive. We want this to be an experience. What are the two words? Immersive was the one. Surprise and delight. Surprise and delight. Talk about immersive. did say. He did say immersive. But yeah, he did come back around on surprise and delight a lot.

I do, jokes aside, have a sense of pride as, you know, San Francisco being my adoptive hometown at this point, right? 18 years here to see you you joked about it but we used to have the PlayStation store like downtown used to be a different spot there with the metry and all this stuff and when that left that sucked and to see so many businesses that have left SF because of prices because of co because of XY andZ over the years.

But one of the other things they mentioned as well was the fact that the when they're approaching making the exclusive merch for the different franchises, they think about the audiences of those franchises, which is hilarious to me because Nintendo all their stuff is like you would think of like family games or kids games, right? All of it is rated E, maybe rated E10 plus for the most part. But there is like a methodology that I really appreciate when I go over to the Animal Crossing uh part of the store and I think about my friends that are into Animal Crossing and I'm like, they're being served here.

And like I don't know, there's something so magical about how different Nintendo franchises so strongly speak uh to such wide audiences in a way where I'm, you know, walking around all these places. I'm not a Pikmin person, but I'm hanging out in the Pikmin area talking to one of the Nintendo employees. And I look and I see Kurt from GameSpot like walk over with a big piece of Pikmin merch.
