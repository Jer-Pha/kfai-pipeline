All of us are very passionate to talk about it, excited to talk about it. Andy Cortez is on a second playthrough of a turnbased RPG, which hell has frozen over. I feel like that's insane to me. It's I mean, dude, if anything, you know, the game is so popular, right? The game word of mouth has gotten to people that would have never tried this game and I am so pumped up about it because now I'm like dude now from here on out developers are taking notice and being like what if we made turn-based games good you know like we can do that too we can also do that this is not the panel to make a [\u00a0__\u00a0] we can also put parries in our games I'm so excited that yeah I'm so interested to talk to you because this There are so many people who don't normally play this type of",

So, I just want to pick your brain and be like, what is this making you feel? Is it the action aspects that are really grabbing you? The story? Oh, yeah. Well, so narratively, right off the rip, this game just kind of grabs you in that first sort of section, right, when we see the the first gamage happen. And immediately I was like, I haven't felt this way about a narrative in a in a long time. And when I think of how I played a decent amount of uh freaking Metaphor refantio and that's usually way more than I would put into a turn-based game that is not Pokemon. And the reason I didn't stick around with Metaphor was legitimately because I was like damn I don't this is going to be a 70 hour 50 hour quest. I don't have time like that right now for this title.",

Like I I always talk I talk more I talk more [\u00a0__\u00a0] about turn-based games that I really, you know, it's just playing into it. But, uh, for definitely it is the action, it's the visuals, it's the characters, it's the parries that reward you. If you choose to dodge, it's easier, but the parry is a much higher risk reward. And then once you start kind of, you know, equipping all the different pictos and luminas and now I'm getting health back for everything, it just feels so rewarding. Everything feels substantial. That and it being 30 hours, I think, is another plus for you. Thousand% thousand%. Me, too. Honestly, though, it does feel great when you pull off a a proper counter or",

Crazy. Hugely great feels. Yeah, I we're we're vibrating in our seats ready to talk about this game. But before we do that, let me get to some housekeeping. Remember, Greg is rocking PAX East Thursday. That is tomorrow, and you need to be a part of it at 11:00 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Pacific. Greg's the keynote speaker, kicking off PAX East, and we'll be doing a Fireside Chat with Final Fantasy and Expedition 33 very own Ben Star. That's crazy. Good for PAX East getting Ben Star.

We wanted to put our own spin on it. we really wanted to make it our own. And in my review, like this is before I talked to them, I was like, \"Hey, I I I guess that came through because that's exactly how I felt. Like, yeah, the UI looks like Persona and all the camera cuts and stylish.\" And then like there are bits and pieces of Final Fantasy 10 and like I talked to them beforehand and they're like, \"Yeah, those are the two games we like mainly drew inspiration from, but it's so much more than that.\" and breaking down why it is not just an amalgamation of",

It's a two-part fight and I think I soloed it with Seal when uh at the very end like she came in in the reserves and my heart was pounding at the end and I was like I'm in and then of course we have the first big twist in that moment which is a very Game of Thrones surprise. The protagonist is dead because we can't afford Charlie Cox for that amount of time. I had the same thought. Yeah. Yeah. you're not all saw that and that's where they had to cut off the budget.

And then by the end I was like, nah, this is definitely I I had a similar trajectory. That I think it's my game of the year right now. I'm like my goatee right now. For me, it's like I'm still rocking for blueprints, but the more I think about this game, I'm like, I haven't played Blueprints yet. So, of the games I've played, this is the one for me.

Um, where I want to start is actually at the end because something that my immediate reaction to the first thing I want to ask people when talking about Clare obscure expedition 33 is which ending did you choose? We get to the end uh after we've kind of it's been revealed that this world we're in exists in a painting and it was all created by the real life version of uh Verso and this is like a childhood painting of his and you're kind of given this question of do you side with Verso uh this kind of uh painting version of Verso and destroy the painting let",

Seems like you're really leading the journey right here. I've seen both endings. So you have an ending that you like, right? That's what it sounds like. Yes. Yes. Yes. Uh Kat, I want to start with you. Which ending did you did you choose? I picked my L's ending, actually. Wow. All right. I wanted to be contrarian, okay, as I tend to be because I felt that the world can be what you make of it. And she had built this life for herself and I don't know, it didn't feel right to take it away. I knew",

I think I do appreciate that about the game, like where you can do one ending and then you can go back to a save and like immediately check out the other. I think they're both bittersweet in their own way and I appreciate that about this game cuz I like fiction where there's no right answers honestly. But really like thematically this game is about grief and found family and being able to move past that grief and taking a step forward into the world. So I think this game is kind of pushing you toward the verso ending. But I like my and I like all my pals from inside the canvas. So, I didn't want to say goodbye. Yeah. Yeah.

What about yourself? Uh, I saw both. I picked my ending first because I'm going to keep it real with you. I kind of it was a little hard to parse what I was choosing at the moment because because the the the way it ramps up towards the very end is that Myel's motivations and what she actually wants is it's like evolving in real time as the scenes are playing out. And so, it it feels like she's changing her mind. And Verso, too. It's like they're both learning something new and making snap decisions in the moment from what they learn from real red. And like the I feel like the ending kind of happens because Verso Verso makes a snap decision to go into the like core of the painting. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz like no matter what ending you choose, you see them like, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] I learned something new. What am I going to do in",

And it I would say it's the more like I it doesn't feel right, but it's the more interesting ending to myself. Yeah, it is. It's chilling because it it plays it's it's almost like a plays into like horror. Yeah. In a very offkey. Oh, yeah. And literally, too, like the way Black Mirror type [\u00a0__\u00a0] Yeah.

So, if this sounds cool to you, make sure you wishlist it. Imperial is a complex, featurerich action RPG where you'll be sent to a planet in a far-off corner of the galaxy to explore an imposing monolith. As an elite mercenary, you'll join the expedition tasked with unearthing the secrets of the monolith and face off against the deadly automatons within. In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith. Accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams. Each cardoggram affects which enemies. Boss fights and loot will appear when you enter the monolith, so no two excursions will be the same. Find even more cardoggrams to explore by",
