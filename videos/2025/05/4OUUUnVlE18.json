I'm joined today by blessing Addio Jr. Good day Tim. Good day to you as well. And joining us is owner of Giant Bomb, Dan Reich. That sounds crazy to hear. I'm still not used to hearing that. It's wild stuff, man. Say it again. Say it again. Say it again. The owner of Giant Bomb. Dan, right? That's the good stuff. That's the good stuff. Oh my god. We got the fog machine. Got to do it. Oh yes. Got to do it. Excellent. Dan, how are you feeling right now? In the last couple days, you and an amazing group of people, Jeff Balar, Jeff Grub, Janachoa, Mike Minady, uh, have secured ownership of Giant Bomb and all of its assets. You have you get the back catalog. You get the social accounts. You get the YouTube channels, the Twitch channels.

And like one of the things that they had mentioned uh in their episode was about how it seems like a lot of the problems at Giant Bomb came from it just not being independent, right? It came from all the different owners that just didn't understand the brand. It didn't understand like what Giant Bomb is and what Giant Bomb brings to the table.

Like I said, super chat them in. I want to start with one super chat really fast. Isaac Danler says, \"Is there is there less story overall or is it paced better?\" Dan, what do you think? I would say uh it is definitely paced better and I think importantly it gets into it so much quicker. Uh I remember booting up the first one and it's like it is a lot of just kind of establishing, you know, you don't even understand the world or anything. Why are they crying? What is this Chyelium stuff? And like since that's kind of all established, that world building in the first game, it just kind of gets into it in this one. And there's there's a event very early on that sets off the events in motion. And uh yeah, and the cut scenes that are there are better as well. So yeah, I I'm the story is a big step up this time.",

So yeah, I I'm the story is a big step up this time. Yeah, I was surprised to watch the beginning of Roger and Mike's Death Stranding one marathon and see how many cut scenes there were in Death Stranding one in the first couple of hours. It is like mostly cutscene in the most in the first couple of hours. Here that is not the case, right? Like here it is paced way better. It gets you into the act of walking way faster. Like there's some establishing cut scenes or whatever, but they're not that long really. They're tone setters and then honestly they do a really good job in the first gameplay sequence of the game of using that as a tone setter as well where I find myself like you know kind of I don't know. It's funny because and Dan, you played it as well, right? like the first I guess destination that you're going to. There's not really any",

There's not really any emotional stakes set immediately in the game, but I still felt emotional about it for some reason. Like I think it's the music and the gauge quil like you're just going home. There's not like a crazy, you know, stakes or anything like that, but just it's it's the music, it is the uh there was this earthquake thing and like boulders going around you like things like that are really cool. Um, but I I said this in my preview for GameSpot that um it felt like the first game was kind of siloed off interactions where it's like I'm at Hartman's lab and now I'm talking to Hartman and now I'm over here. I'm in my room talking to Fragile. And so this one feels more like if you ever watched Arrested Development, there are the first three seasons where like the whole ensemble cast is together, you",

And this one felt like that weird fourth season where like none of the actors could be in the room at the same time. So it was just like basically two people siloed off interactions. Uh, this feels more like an ensemble crew. Like when you go back to the Mellin, which is like your ship, and it's just like, oh, a bunch of cool, fun characters interacting together. It's a lot better. I I will say though that like to the question of is there less story overall? I would say no. Like there's there's just as much story, I think it's just better paced and better done. And the story serves like it it serves like getting you into the gameplay better as far as like what you're doing, why you're doing it.

And like one of the things I like that Dan mentioned um in our first preview that we put up last week was the fact of like they're telling you about Chyelium printers. And I didn't I didn't have to think about it. I was like, \"Oh, I know what that is. I get what I understand what that means. Kyle printed diapers.\" Yes. I was just like, \"Yeah, yeah, that's normal. That's fine. That makes sense.\" If if you are confused at any point even during a cut scene there's this corpus thing this like you know it's like that I haven't played Final Fantasy 16 we call it like an active lore active war or like a vowed had that too where it's anytime there's like a proper noun or something you can easily easily be like oh right here's this",

I got a question for Tim. Yes, this is Death Stranding 2's unanswered questions. We're taking in questions from the audience. My question for you Tim is are you going to check out Death Stranding 2? I forget what your story was with Death Stranding one. The very quick story because I have been saying this a lot recently because it was recently that I got back into it, but I tried it when it first came out and I'm a huge Metal Gear guy, but I I like when Metal Gear is in control. I like it when it's telling a story that I believe we're going to get an ending to.

And so getting into Death Stranding, I'm like, seemingly it's all the things I like least about Kojima's storytelling and characters. And uh so I didn't make it too far. I think I made it like 3 to 5 hours in the first time and then years later like earlier this year um I gave it another shot on PS5 and I liked it so much more but I also stopped playing around 3 to 5 hours. So it didn't stick with me like I I want to like Death Stranding so much more than I actually like Death Stranding. And I'm hoping I can push through that. Everything I'm seeing from two seems to solve a lot of my issues that I have. My problem is everything you guys are saying now of like, oh, two just jumps into it and it has the understanding of one, so it's a lot better.

But to answer your question, yes, I'm going to give two a shot and I'm very excited to I will say to that last part, there is the recap in the game that is like um it's like a slideshow essentially of here's what happened in Destiny one. It goes through all the major characters and I think it serves as a pretty good baseline for getting you into Death Stranding 2 because Death Stranding 2, even though it works off of all the rules of Death Stranding one, I think the corpus thing that Dan brought up, um, you know, does really well at keeping you in the know of, all right, what's this concept? All right, what's this thing? All right, what are the BTS? What are the BBs? What are like, you know, they define pretty much everything for you. And the story in Death Straining 2 is it it's",

You're in Australia for the bulk of this game, right? You go to a completely new location and you're meeting a a lot of new ensemble and the story here feels a bit more standalone to like what's happening actively in like the main narrative. Of course, the world establishment and stuff is all destroying one, right? But I think you might be able to I think you'll be fine uh jumping into Death Ring 2 if you played some of Destiny 1. Yeah. Well, I'm I'm very interested in that. But I'm more interested in the two of you because you got to play 30 hours of this game. I listened to your games cast preview last week.

So, I think people would be surprised by that. Yeah. I mean, I've been thinking about it a lot, right? I, you know, we talked a lot about how going into it playing the idea of doing a 30-hour preview that we weren't going to be able to keep our saves for was a bit frustrating and a bit like, ah, man, all right, I'm going to have to replay this thing during the for the review.

Like, you know, in the the first game, you might remember having the the PCC's. They were the things that like would allow you to build any number of like, okay, I'm going to build a zipline. I'm going to build a watchtowwer. And some of that can play into uh this. Like if you're approaching an outpost, you can build a watchtowwer. You can, you know, tag all the enemies before you go in and try stealth. Or you can do a thing that I prefer, which is Doll Man, the puppet dude from the trailers. You can just throw him like a softball above the base and he hovers and you see through Doll Man's eyes.

You did great.\" So like that's my way of tagging guys. And then yeah, you can go in, you can do all sorts of stealth stuff. You can do, you know, tran sniper rifles from a distance. You can go in and try to uh choke him out with the rope, things like that. There's decoy like hollow uh holographic decoy grenades. So like you can throw one of those and it might pop up and it's like an ostrich or something and it distracts a dude. Or it could look like you or another soldier. So, it's kind of con contextually it'll have something pop up and distract guys and then when [\u00a0__\u00a0] hits the fan, you know, there's any number of like there are weapons you will want to use versus like in the first one I would get weapons and I'm like, I'm not going to use this.

And another bonus is when you look in that corpus uh and you you look at the different people you can deliver to, it will tell you like, oh, you'll get an automatic handgun if you get a closer relationship with this person. You'll get a customized electric rod if you keep going here. So, you can decide which suborders you want to pursue. You know, that's so cool. I didn't I didn't realize that they told you that stuff.

I was really excited when I did a sub order for um a character and they gave me like a sniper rifle um a non-lethal sniper rifle. Um and I was like, \"Oh, I'm going to use this for every every encampment.\" It's also funny hearing you talk about Dall Man and using Dall Man to mark uh Dan because like I didn't even think to do that. Like I knew Dall Man had that functionality, but I was so locked in on the Watchtowers, which is like another PCC structure that you can build. And usually because of the way the Chyro network works with people playing online, I would get close to an enemy structure that I knew or an enemy camp that I knew I wanted to go into.

And then I would then start to use like, you know, more close-up weapons. But I'll see that number tick down and I'm like, \"All right, there's one more person left in this camp. Let's scan. Okay, he's over there. Let's go get him. Take him out.\" And for me, that was always my uh routine.

Um, and so like when I look at the Death Raining 2 combat system versus versus something like MGS5, it's an interesting comparison cuz I the I think the inspiration is there as far as the direction taken with it, but I don't think I would I would I would never say that it touches MGS's",

And so there are things like certain enemies will have on helmets in ways that remind me of like MGS5 where if you hit it, it'll knock off the helmet and now like get another shot and they'll go down, right? Like it has a lot of those basic concepts from MGS5, but I definitely don't want to overstate how much this is still death stranding compared to an MGS5 even though like it has those MGS5 flares there as far as what they're doing with the combat. Also, even like uh that's the bandit encounters that we've mostly been talking about, but if you remember the first game, the BT encounters would be I thought they were the biggest pain in the ass because it's like I'm bad at stealth, so the BTS would spot me, the",

Or there's things like the blood boomerang, which is a boomerang that like you can siphon Sam's blood into the boomerang, charge up a shot, and you headshot a BT and they just totally dissipate. and your blood grenades and everything. So, like now it's just I don't worry about like I have to crouch walk and hold my breath and oh no, the baby's crying. It's just I I will go in there, I'll try some stealth and then when they spot me, I'm just going to kill them all. Yeah. Uh Hungry Four Dog says, \"Is the doll man annoying?\" Oh, no. He's the best.

The holograms do look better though. Like the the holograms are way more like I guess just defined, right? Like they're clear a bit like a bit more polygons to them. Uh but yeah, that's still the core of the game is that you are in Australia. Um you're working with Drawbridge, which is Fragile's new company. Um and like you have new characters as part of Drawbridge and all that stuff. And you are reconnecting the Cairo network within Australia.

So, like there you'll meet some fun characters that aren't major, but will pop up from time to time. And then another question comparing it to the first game.

Uh, if there's one tip I would give, which also applies to the first one, it's just be very liberal with your use of that auto arrange cargo thing. It's just like when you're on the cargo management screen, hold in triangle and it'll just like just kind of put everything on SAM in a way that makes sense and if you drop stuff or whatever, just keep doing that. Um, but no, there are a lot of menus. Uh it seems overwhelming at first, but you do really get used to it. And there are some good like hotkey situations and stuff you can use now to to navigate that. Yeah, there are a lot of uh wheels now. Um and so like you'll go and you'll have like a like it's not even a weapon wheel, it's like an item wheel.

Uh, but even in there they have like an auto arrange thing where I think it's like one of the buttons on the D-pad go to like the top right thing and it's like auto arrange and you can do it right there. Um, and I think that helps tremendously as far as that. But when I look at the menus for actual like arranging the packages stuff, I I think mostly it's the same, but there's just a lot more going on now too as well. Dr. Ryan says, \"Dan, in your article you said it feels easier to engage in combat now that all the weapons are non-lethal. Does the shooting feel better? I love DS1, but the combat was a tad clunky. Yeah, it feels great. And you know, Bless talked about it feeling like Phantom Pain. And you know, you're talking",

There's even like the little details where it's like when the helmet flies off or you get that head shot, it's like just kind of slows down and uh you know, when you get caught and stuff, there's like these lens flares on the screen that like feels straight out of Metal Gear Solid vibe. So again, don't want to raise expectations too much. It is not Phantom Pain, but um it's it's definitely better than it was in the first one. Dan Dan, correct me if I'm wrong. It does have like the when you're spotted, the time slows down like Miller Solid 5. I can't tell if down when I was getting when I was getting head shots and stuff. It would definitely do that a short like but I don't I can't remember if it did it when you get caught. Yeah, that was one of",

But even then, like it is very it's in ways that I think MGS5 in that way is pretty generous as far as how the combat went. This game also, I think, is fairly generous as far as like, all right, stealth is hard. So, we're going to give you the options to like take somebody out pretty easily if you if you get caught or like if yeah, if you want to be able to have time slow down for a second so you can maybe get one or two head shots in a row real quick.

When you get to the final game and you like see the depths and you see the sky and all that stuff, like it turns out to be a way way bigger experience. I will say that we've only played the first 40% of this game theoretically, right? Like they told us at the preview event that where we'll get by the end of the week should be around 40% of the game. I'm not discounting some wild [\u00a0__\u00a0] happening in that second half. Like in fact, I'm kind of expecting maybe not like a MGS2 situation, but like something along the lines of, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] didn't see this coming.\" Like that sort of thing, right?

Like I have no idea what they could do, but the amount of like the amount that they let us play and the amount of nonrestrictions on how much we can talk about makes me go wow that's kind of weird. The fact that we can talk about whatever we want here like except for like a couple of things. Um, but for the most part, so far from what we have played, it does feel very iterative in building upon death rating one in a way that I think is beyond anything that Kojima has done uh before in terms of that, right? Like this is a chronological direct sequel to Death Stranding one. Melar typically hasn't really been that as far as MGS to MGS2, you have a new character. MGS3 is a prequel.

And it could be a response to we want to make a game that objectively is going to have a really high Metacritic and it's going to do really well or a lot better than Destrating One did on the critical level. It could be that or they could be saving something for the second half. I don't know.

Um but I did look in the corpus and it said something about like oh go to the east coast of Australia something about another plategate. So, I mean, I got about halfway across Australia in my time with the game. And again, if that's 30 to 40%. Wouldn't surprise me if maybe there's something past that, but I don't know the scope of it. You know, I was also thinking the same thing of like, yeah, you get you maybe finish Australia in another 20 hours and then they send you to an entirely different continent. That would make this game seem gigantic, though. Yes. Which, to be fair, like 30 hours, 40%, right? Then you're talking about a game that is 70 hours long. So, I could see it. I'm not expecting it.

Like, do you think that you you guys played a fair amount in this game? Do you think that there's room for this to keep growing for another 30, 40 hours? Yeah, I'm curious. I feel like I didn't really like at the time we were kind of wrapping up, we were still getting pretty big things like you know the Montreal and some of the vehicle stuff uh was pretty pretty late in our time with the game.

Like we got we've had like a like a cutscene with him. As far as where I ended my playthrough, I didn't actually get to like the final final mission. I was like two missions away, so I was close.

Um, you know, we talked a little bit earlier about how like, uh, it is a little less of a pain in the ass to climb up mountains and stuff, but it gives you just enough friction still to where, you know, when you build a zipline and now you can just go right over that mountain instead of climbing it, it does feel like a oh, sweet.

But if as far as the plot as far as like following the characters, the narrative, you might be able to get away with watching a recap. But I it's so funny how quaint a lot of like the new concepts introduced are in this game because I experienced the first game and so like they say things that I'm like yeah that makes sense. I couldn't imagine then hopping into this game for the first time and having to hear them talk about certain things and like seeing Fragile eat a cryobite and being like why she just eat a beetle like why is that happening?

I was I didn't really get a sense of how much you can do with the Montreal. I got to imagine that you can do quite a lot with it cuz like one of the first things they teach you um or one of the missions they put you on when they first introduce the Montreal is to connect the um a mine to one of the city structures. Um and like basically what the Montreal does is it's what it sounds like, right? Like it's a train that you can take back and forth. Um but you can also load it with resources. And so if you go to a mine, you can create a bunch of metals and then transport the metals to the city and then like use that as a spot of all right, cool. I want to make this at this location. Cool.
