            "text": "The game is set to release at a $79.99 price point. Obviously, this $80 conversation we're having with games right now is frustrating at the least and not fun because it feels like we're going to be stuck in this conversation ad nauseium. Xbox has said in the last couple months that it's pushing its games up to 80. So, this isn't a surprise. It's just I think unfortunate that this title is the first one that they're that they're doing that with on the Nintendo side. Like so far the only game officially priced, not collector's edition or anything at $80 has been Mario Kart World. And I've been playing the hell out of that game. But $80 for what we're given doesn't feel right to me. This does look bigger and more substantial than even Outer Worlds one, but $80 just is it's not great no matter what way you shake",
