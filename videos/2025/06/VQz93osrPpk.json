I'm joined today by blessing Addio Jr. Good day, Tim. Snowike Mike. Good morning, Tim. And returning to the kind of funny studio, it's Greg Miller. Hello, everybody. What's this little uh sweater going on? Uh this is a custom sweater uh from our friend Ekka at Outer Loop Games. You know him from a bunch of different games. Of course, Thirsty Suitor is the most recent one. Uh he gave this uh sweatshirt to me uh well actually he gave Ben his own one I think when he came over at GDC and I was like clearly Jen and I need that and Ekka said of course I like you guys enough. And gave me and Jen them. Then Ekka big timed me at SGF. I don't like throwing developers under the bus, but I'm gonna do it here, right? He's showing his game, Dose of Divas, right? I'm excited to see this. Obviously, I loved all of Ekka's games throughout the Outer Loop career here. I'm",

Eka's been invited to be on Giant Bomb and he's worried about traffic, so they're going to he has to leave. And I said, no, I'm only there Saturday. And they said, well, can we get another Saturday time? And I said, you cannot. I am booked solid with amazing games. And so that's why I don't know anything about his game. I don't know anything about it. And frankly, until he comes and makes me food and shows me the game, we're enemies. Those are the only options. Don't take it as a threat, but take it as an opportunity. You know, Greg, how are you doing?

I gave it an 8.5 uh on our kind of scale saying it was great. I think I I am with you guys, not to the as detrimental as Mike was of I think Call of Duty was a bad ender. I think if you could have had a hey, we have this game that is going to be hype and caught you off guard or whatever. Even if it was just a tease, I think that would have been enough to for most cement an 85 if not push it closer to an amazing.

That's such a nice name. Just call it the Xbox ally. The rose this Asus ASUS, you know what I mean? We're all over the place at a lot of these naming conventions. And the fact that they just took the Rag Ally and shoved Xbox into the name, you got to respect it. You got to respect. You do. Uh yes, Timothy, I have touched uh and played on the ROG Ally uh I'm sorry, the ROG Xbox Ally, henceforth known as the Xbox Ally. I did the Xbox Ally X.

Did you get to get hands on and did they even have the lower-end one? They had the lower-end one there. Yes. So it ran in two different things where there was an hourong uh presentation seminar. Maybe it was half an hour. No, it was an hourong presentation behind closed doors. Me and a bunch of other jouros and media and creators there, right? Where they gave a presentation. We got to hear from Rowan, who you've seen in the videos and stuff, head of Xbox design. Uh Sean from ASUS.

What is the official title? Reloaded. Reloaded. Gears whatever the hell you know what I'm talking about. Uh on it uh at 60 frames a second uh out there, you know, doing the damn thing. Uh playing it that way. We saw that on the TV through a dock or through a USBC connection over to it. Uh and then that was taken away. Then outside of that were creator pods where people could go and film Tik Toks or podcasts or interviews or whatever.

I mean, what I want to know is first off, how it actually feels in your hand because I really love a lot of these devices, and I think that we're very lucky that we're at a point that uh more often than not, they're premium experiences at this point, which is great. I love the way the Steam Deck feels. A very, very high quality plastic. We have the Raj Ally, the the normal one, the Raj Ally X that that you have. That is also nice. I wouldn't say quite as nice feeling as the Steam Deck. Uh see, we differ on that, but go ahead.

And I'm including Switch 2 in there where extensively playing it in handheld on the my flights. Damn, my hand hurts. Uh, so with this new one with the more Xbox styled the grips grips, how you feeling about it? I thought these looked so dumb when the images leaked. You know what I mean? I And I love my Portal. Don't get me wrong, but as somebody who does love how the Alli X feels right now natively in my hand at home, I was like, \"Oh, this looks dumb. This looks weird.\" Holding it was a different story. It like everything they're saying in the documentary video just had up, you know, they have a whole thing in there of like the grips were so important. It it's the evolution of the Xbox controller.

And I do It's not that I miss it, I think, or or for the next however many months till holiday, right, is what they're saying. I'll miss it on my Ally X, but I think when I get it, it'll be like, \"Oh, this feels way better. It does feel like holding an Xbox controller.\" And I think that's one of the interesting things. I've been, of course, a fan of kind of funny for a long time. And so, you know, I listen to your Games Cast review of the Xbox showcase. I think I'm an hour six minutes in watch the Greg way that I had to stop the Games Cast to record the Greg Way. And it was one of those things Andy, I think, was really not hung up on, but kept mentioning how he doesn't like how much it looks like an ASUS piece",

And I think listening to the presentation uh from Rowan and from Sean and them talking about how this came to be and how collaborative they want it to be, I really do feel that they wanted this to be. You look at it and you see the Xboxness of it and you see the Asusness of it. And so I think there's an interesting line they're trying to walk that I think works for me personally. I love the little, you know, Xbox rogs all over it and the graphics. I you know the handheld up there even the uh Xbox button on it right they had a whole conversation talking to us about it I think it might even be in this video in this video yeah right where it's like they didn't want it to be round they wanted it to be things so they put it all together",

And I know just last week it was we on Games Daily talked about Jez being like that's dead, that's not happening. Who knows if that's actually the case, but I think in my mind that's why they were so like let's meet in the middle. We're doing this together. This is clearly the middle ground of two companies coming together and then if slash they were going to do an Xbox handheld, it'll look I would think or would have more Xbox. Yeah.",

Whereas this is I I think like their best first step because they need to do stuff now because we're in a place where these handheld PCs are a market that is full of enthusiasts that you need to deliver this stuff to. So that leads me to the most important question which is the OS. Yeah. Because all this other stuff the screen's the same as the one you have like Yeah. It's more powerful. You're not going to notice that just playing at a preview event, did you? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, no. I mean, yeah. Again, the thing for me as somebody who plays Rogue religiously right now, right, his Ally X, like I watching Gears and playing Gears and then they had it up on the TV and the 60 frames were clicking and it looked great.

Now, I I think I'd love to see it on my current Ally X, see if there's any difference, blah blah blah. But no, I don't have intense thoughts obviously in how it is. I thought it looked really well. Booted faster than most of my games on my Alli X do. Granted, again, this is all preview hardware and preview OS. So, who knows how it'll actually shake out. Yeah. A lot of people in the chat are asking what the price is. We do not have a price on this. Do not have a price. Do not have. You should expect $900 for this. That is most likely what this is going to end up being. Sure. Uh, so then you want to know $900. Excuse me. OS. They'll probably have what I isn't right now. It's $8.99 for",

Um, but in terms of the OS overall, I wasn't a doubter by any stretch of the imagination, but as somebody who already is in this ecosystem and already using so many of the things they are touting here and touted throughout the Xbox uh uh presentation, you know, driving home Xbox play anywhere, all those games, Play Anywhere, working with third parties for Play Anywhere. I haven't had the hurdles that I had heard so many people talk about before. When I was talking about my Steam Deck and how I wanted another one, but how I wanted to get my other stores on there and how I wanted to do these things, some people would pop up and say, \"Greg, you really should look into the the Allies, right?\" And I said, \"Well,",

I've heard that Windows yada yada yada.\" I love using the version of Windows that is on my Alli X. I find it super responsive to touch. It's easy to get in. I just leave all my games on my main screen. I let them create the, you know, the desktop shortcut. I'm in, I'm going, I'm fine. Keyboards are actually nice, yada yada yada. Occasionally, there'll be the gripe where I try to bring up a keyboard and it doesn't go the right place and I have to do this. But, for me, in my personal experience, night and day versus trying to use my touchcreen on the Steam Deck to do the same thing because I think Steam Deck is doing what Xbox is trying to do here with Xbox ally, right? In terms of having the OS there and sometimes it gets finicky touchy. I don't I don't like it.",

I don't know how much this would be needed or work or what about this and what about that workaround?\" And I was, now I don't want to eat my words off of preview, but I was like, \"Damn, this is nice.\" And they seem to have the answers in ways I didn't think they would. Uh, of course, you know, as we've seen throughout the videos, and I'm sure Barrett will continue to show you, this looks like your Xbox system. Of course, uh, when you're able to go in and jump into the system, it takes all your games from all your different libraries and has them there with their little logos on it for Battleet.

I think this is just you don't want to bog it down with it. I I don't think they showed in any of this stuff. correct me if I'm wrong, but internally when we were getting this demo, another thing kept talking about was Discord of like, okay, you know, you're going to be able to boot into Discord over in this window and be able to do it. That's in the my apps got it tab of this, too.

Of course, is that the fact that when you turn this on and you're running this thing, it will bring you straight to the Xbox screen. It will not load Windows. It will not jump through those hoops. All the resources they were saying that Windows usually eats up in the background would no longer be happening. They're just there then all that stuff's available more for games, right? Which is obviously great news in terms of not having some background process running. My question then became uh when I was tooling around there was a you know go to Windows or you know load Windows mode or whatever. So I assumedly you can still do that if you need to, right?

I was like, what is it going to be like if I want to install Discord? I want to install Steam. I want to do this. Like that's not built in. So do I have to boot into Windows, load it there, come out of this, do that, blah blah blah. And her answer was no. like in the this version of what you're looking at on the screen already, there will be a a Internet Explorer, a browser of some kind, right, that you can go to Steam, download, and it will all do it there, so you never have to go to Windows and do that, which wouldn't be the end of the world, but I like the idea that they're so committed to not breaking your immersion in what this device is that they're doing that, booting it and",

Yeah. And the exciting thing is the idea of this is that this isn't tied to these systems that Greg's using. Like this would be an OS that they can then put on even their older um products, but then also their future products, but also other products. And I think that the main goal is getting this on Windows desktop PCs because if you can then you have your PC have a gaming mode that actually works for Xbox the way that it's supposed to, that's going to be such a major step forward for how things currently are working but with workarounds or working but with a lot of caveats and a lot of things of that it's not optimized and not not that console-like",

But again, loading a different thing to do a different thing.

But again, as somebody wellversed in the Ally X, it was interesting to see them merge that together with the Xbox, which I'm well verssed in as well. and how well it worked. And it is super exciting.

Brandon in the chat says, \"Is it going to be worth the upgrade from the Alli X, though?\" I do think that is a big problem that we're facing here, which is PC gaming in general and how it's always been where there's always going to be a new upgrade.

You're going upstairs to get uh your stuff for a party or whatever you're going to go to that night ride.

That's a mixtape uh Colin made for her. Colin was her first kiss and it was just to get it out of the way or whatever. And then this cuts to the memory then of them leaning and kissing. And then this is when one of the developers came over, Woody, and he's like, \"I got to play this part with and he grabbed the controller and I had my side and it's just two tongues with the teeth open and the two tongues like lapping into each other and doing this that you could play obviously by yourself but he wanted to make me uncomfortable.

And so like you're going between it like I I had four tracks in it. It was uh That's Good by DVO, uh Just Like Honey by The Jesus and Mary Chain, Freak by Silver Chair, and then Rainbow by Sensitive to Light. Uh the freak uh silver chain part you saw earlier in there where they have the burgers and stuff in their car. This was an interesting one and again setting up how unlike anything I've played this is where they get in the car and well they have the flashback to the car scene or whatever, right?

I was like oh. Oh. So then I just watched them driving in the car being stoic and I was like, \"Wait, hit the button.\" It's like, \"Oh, I did it.\" And then they just started doing and they're pumping their fists, blah blah blah. And then rather than it just be them pumping like this, it would then cut and it would be Cassandra in the back playing with the lights as I hit the buttons and then her Stacy pounding on the side of the car and then they went and got burgers and they're saying burger weird.

So you go and you find him and you put them up and it's all from the first night Cassandra snuck out with y'all. And of course, you go to a house party, she gets too drunk, so you got to carry her out. But the cops show up to bust it up and they put her in a shopping cart and that's where rainbow sensitive light kicks up and you start pushing the shopping cart down the street.

I tell you Sarah I've been doing this for 25 years and I've only seen this five or six time. I was like I thought it was the funniest [\u00a0__\u00a0] joke and then they crash out and do the whole thing and it was just like damn they have set this up so well where I'm like so h I I am so pain that I don't have the full game that I'm so stoked man this is music to my ears cuz like obviously I loved Artful Escape which was also a gameplay light game u but more about the experience",

What would you say is the balance between active playing and kind of just experiencing more cinematic stuff? It's hard to say. I would say gameplay is minimal. I think, you know, if we want to go into what's going to catch this game and hurt it or what haters are going to hate about, right, it's the idea that yeah, you're watching a movie for a lot. you're you're participating, but again, it's I'm doing a skate segment that doesn't really matter.

I think that's going to be an issue for people. I wonder about length. You know, this is a 30-minute demo, maybe a little bit less when I s because I sat and talked for a while, too. Like, I got through four tracks on it. How long is this mixtape? How much are we actually going to get in the music? Cuz it's so tied into it. None of that stops me. None of that scares me.

I would say this is a completely different dream. I'm just excited to see the creators of this have another shot to make something special. Uh I didn't put it in my notes here, but like you know this is a Kickstarter. Uh I I put my money into it over there as well, but it like set some records and did a whole bunch of things and you know blew blew apart the funding because there are so many Patapon sickos like myself. So this demo was a great taste of it. Uh I am excited to actually get in and start really playing it. There is a demo up right now for Steam NextFest that you can get jump in and do. But as you see like going in and leveling this up, picking the different you know rogue light cards there at the end and stuff to figure out what your next thing is going to be.

Difficulty might not be the right word, but some kind of scalability to make sure everybody can play. Interesting. Okay. Sorry. Um, yeah, like you saw one there was a giant horse enemy dragon.

Oh yeah, Greg, you have three more games here that I want to hear about. All right, Theater of Idols coming 2025 from Vermilla Studios published by Blumhouse Games. Yeah, this is uh I I did backto-back uh Blumhouse Games uh ones in here. You have uh this one here for Chris and then we'll talk about Grave Seasons in a second. Um, last year of course, uh, Blumhouse, uh, made a big presentation at SGF about the fact they were doing all these games and they did the one that I can picture. Thank you so",

There is I I don't think it's a that they're bad. They just didn't speak to me, if you will. Uh so yeah, this is uh Cruz as we said you're in this and this doesn't really show it that off well I think but like it's a first person horror action game set in Hispania a twisted version of Spain and the idea is you watch here your guns shoot blood bullets so you suck the blood out of dead things you find around the world right these are mannequins you're fighting so they wouldn't bleed which sucks let me tell you and if you don't have anybody body's blood to suck, you can suck your own blood and use those as",

But it's very, as you see, survival horror, you know, reminiscent of Resident Evil. So, it was a lot of sneaking and a lot of trying to, you know, craft a resource or get the med pack to get to here to open the thing, but these guys are chasing me. Bah. I don't think abbreviated demo did it justice. I think it was one of those like I'd want to play that from the start to really get my head strapped on because in there I was like, \"Okay, I don't think the blood getting sucked out looks that great. It's a cool concept, but it didn't look incredible.\" The gunplay didn't feel like I was enjoying this. I didn't And maybe that again, that's the point. It is survival horror, but I'm getting multiple mannequins coming at me. I want them to die and go away. There's a big creature. I",

So, I'll be interested to see as we get further in there because I like Blum House so far with the one game and the idea and the movies obviously, but we'll see if it's maybe I'm just I'm also not a shooter guy or an old school survival horror guy. So, we'll see. And then Grave Seasons, the other one from Blow Mouse Games. Uh, Grave Seasons, a narrative farming sim with a terrifying twist. Someone in the town is a supernatural serial killer. Farm, romance, and investigate your way through the unsettling town of Ashen Ridge. As we all know, farming sims are a dime a dozen.

You start lying about who you are, what you're doing, and you start doing the normal farming [\u00a0__\u00a0] and then all of a sudden, you meet somebody, this happens, and then a [\u00a0__\u00a0] werewolf attacks that person and drags them into the woods, and there's blood, and it's just like, okay. Like, if it wasn't the farming sim, I might be more into it. But again, I'm just not the farming sim person. Like, that's not what I really like. I I love an Animal Crossing, not so much a Harvest Moon, you know? So, it's interesting. It's quirky.

You know, you have your light attack, you have your force palm, you have like I took a I don't want to show it to the audience because I'm not sure if that but like this is the controls and then they were putting the combos down here, Mike. And it was like my head was swimming already to jump in there and figure this out. And so it was like everything felt like it took two more steps than I would want to of like talk to this NPC.

Then you rotate it with your stick and then you can go and like there's I there was a very nice gentleman with me who has a very high fallutin title over there and I felt so bad for him cuz the first he's doing it and I'm trying to do it but there's things on this. So I clicked it and I lifted it but then I dropped it too early and it it's a preview so it bugged out on where I dropped it.

And you'd whail on him and get him stunned or whatever. He'd go down and then you by in the fight you were breaking pillars. So then you had to do the same thing to pick up the pillars and then slam him on the [\u00a0__\u00a0] head with it. And I was like, \"This is dope.\" You know, 30 minutes or maybe it was even an hour in, I forget. And now it's clicking.

Again, not intuitive. You still got to climb on your horse. Assassin's Creed had finally done away with that. Remember where the horse runs in and we just jump on the horse? I want the horse. Let me on the horse. I jump on the horse. I run in. I'm running through these fights. I get knocked off my horse. And then it was like 30 [\u00a0__\u00a0] dudes from different armies all fighting me.

But on a plus side of it, like again, I think it's not intuitive, but then again, would any video game being tossed in there be? There was a section of, okay, cool. We get up there, we fix these cannons. Now we got to shoot these cannons to take out these watchtowwers, right? And so it was finding the sweet spot, targeting, knocking them down. As you look here, the game is gorgeous. I didn't think it presented well on the TV. Not that it was bad, but I think this is prettier than what I was playing on the TV.

Only Xbox Play Anywhere compatible titles.\" Talking about the Xbox Ally, that is correct. I don't feel like they're being vague. I feel like they're being very clear about that part. It's just where it gets confusing is that there's a lot of just different parts. There's three avenues to play. There's natively with Xbox Play Anywhere PC, a PC game, an Xbox PC game. There's cloud gaming, which would be your library as it is so far. And then there's remote play. That's what they're saying. So, yes, it could play your whole library.
