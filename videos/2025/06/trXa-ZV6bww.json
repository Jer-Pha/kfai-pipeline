Welcome in to your Kind of funny games afternoon stream for a lovely Monday, June 9th, 2025. I'm back and I missed you. Welcome in kind of funny best friend. It's Mike running up some Mario Kart with each and every one of you. And it's a fun one. It's a special one because it's Monday. It's my favorite day of the week. You know what I mean? We're back to work. We're back with all of you having some fun. But we're also kicking off my first time turning on my Nintendo Switch 2 and playing it. Uh, of course, I got my Nintendo Switch while I was sick last week on Friday. And guess what? I spent all weekend downloading all of my game collection over from my Nintendo Switch One. Uh Barrett said that I downloaded so many games that I sucked up all of the memory on this game. I only have 2.5 gigs of memory left. So, I guess I've done a good job. But I will tell you, it took all Friday night and",

I guess I did a pretty good job downloading all my favorite games. And as you can see, you know, you go over here and it's like I looked at my Switch One library and I was like, \"Well, what games need to come over with me to kick off my Switch 2 gameplay?\" Does MLB The Show 2022 with Show Otani really need to carry over? I was like, \"Yeah, probably not.\" And then I was like, \"Well, does Witcher 3, the complete edition, need to carry over?\" And I was like, \"Yeah, probably.\" You know what I mean?

We got a problem here up at the top. Rex is holding it down. Who's going to catch up to Rex? And Mario with a big red shell. That's going to slow Rex down, but Rex is going to stay in first position. Now, what Mario was it? We're not sure. We're not sure. Now that's Dylan right there. Dylan, summertime Mario and Alexio. But now, uh-oh, Wal Luigi has shown up. And it's vampire Waluigi. I didn't know they had such a thing. They call him the count in some areas. Number first. Number one. That's where it counts. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And boom. A big explosion, but that's going to push him forward and keep the first place position. We see right behind him, Toad clocking out of that Yoshi Burger right behind him. We also now have a a Daisy. A Daisy's going to take first place. It's Ryan. Oh no, it's another Daisy. It's",

And here we go. Jando Rando looking great. Kind of moving like a Tetris block left or right. I That's not how my car moves. It might be lag. Could be connection issues. Now hitting the switchbacks. It's going to be a left right snake like formation here down the track. Can Jando rip and ride this? Got to keep an eye out behind him. I believe that is a Wario, but not our Wario on a motorcycle.

I think it did go to Daisy. No, they got a caramel apple pop. They're going to eat the caramel apple pop. They're going to get through. There they go. There they go. There they go. First place looking good. They're kind of in position here. Holding on to a green shell. No, King Boo stole the green shell, but now we're in the turnpike. That's the name of the game.
