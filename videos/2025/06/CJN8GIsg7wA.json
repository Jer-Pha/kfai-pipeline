Um, but what is your your hype levels in general right now? Bless. I'm really excited. I don't know what we're about to see. I just know that it's a new Sonic thing. And so, we're about to watch the trailer. I Yeah, I'm very excited cuz I I guess for me, the thing that blows me away is that I didn't expect a Sonic thing.

I thought maybe if we did it would be Sonic Heroes or something like a Sonic Heroes remaster. Yeah. I mean, what would get you the most excited for Sonic? What is this? Revolution. Uh, I don't that's the thing is I don't know. Like going into it blind, I would say I really liked Frontiers. Mhm. But if if this is going to be more Frontiers, I would have expected it to just be called Frontiers 2. Mhm. On the other hand, I like I mean we everybody loves Mania. We all love Mania, man. And so if you told me that Sonic uh Revolution is going to be like a 2D like a return to 2D Sonic, right?

I'd be excited for that, but I don't get that vibe from this title. Yeah, Sonic Revolution. Yeah, it's a very it it feels more AAA, I would say, than like a mania. But I mean, hey, I mean, is this the Adventure 3 that we've all been waiting for? I mean, real talk, Sonic Revolution does sound like a adventure style game. Yes. All right. Well, are you ready to watch this trailer? I'm so ready. All right, let's get into it. First, there was a hedgehog. Already, I'm hyped. Roger. I think it's Roger Spin. There was Spinball. It is Ro. Eventually, we went to Saturn. There was an adventure. Before we got to Mania and explored new frontiers, but now it's time for a revolution. Notice how they mentioned all of the major reolution.

You know, blessing, I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time in the games industry. It came to me when I tried to classify your species, Sonic fans. I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment. But you, you Sonic fans, do not. You move into an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed. Is this how you feel? The only way to survive is to spread to another area. There's another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Blessing. Do you know what it is? A virus. Sonic fans are a disease, a cancer on this planet. You are a plague. And we I hate",

It's back to making sense again. that can now explain explain more of what happened here. Okay. So, is this confirmed that it's not real whatsoever? It's not real at all. So, at the Wise A preview event, right, me and Andy are hanging out. We're we're hanging out with Tam and a group of people. Tam starts telling uh Andy about this game called Sonic Revolution. He's like, \"Yo, you hear the rumors? You see the rumors about Sonic Revolution?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, it's going to be this big crossover game, yada yada.\" And I'm looking at I'm like looking at T. I'm like, \"You're [\u00a0__\u00a0] with me. There's no I've not heard a peep about this. This isn't real.",

He's making crossovers with other Sega IP or whatever and doing all this stuff like, and I'm like, \"No, like this.\" And he's he go he doubles down on it so strongly that and that I was like, \"Oh, all right. That's crazy.\" And then he's at the last second he's like, \"No, I'm [\u00a0__\u00a0] with you, dude. That's not real.\" I was like, \"I [\u00a0__\u00a0] knew it.\" All right. All right. The next day, I get a message on Slack from Greg Miller where he says, it was something along the lines of, \"Do you want the Sonic Revolution remote appointment for Summer GameFest?\" And you go, \"Yeah, sign me up.\" And he gives you the thumbs up. Yes. And like it's funny cuz I get that message as I'm still hanging out with Tim",

Wednesday, May 14th, at 11:05 a.m., Tam texts Greg Miller, can you do me a favor and send Blessing a message asking if he wants to do the Sonic Revolution remote appointment for Summer Gamefest? And Greg goes, \"When is it? Why don't I just book it for him?\" And Tam goes, \"Firstly, it doesn't exist.\" Greg goes, \"Why are you asking us about it? Lol.\" And he goes, \"I'm just [\u00a0__\u00a0] with him. Lol. I told him about it and then told him it's fake and then told him I was joking. It's real.\" So, he's very confused.

This is the hardest I've ever been got maybe in my life. Yeah. And I want to let you know, Bless, I want you to know that there is a Slack thread that might be the most insane thing I've ever been a part of. It was like, it felt like 1000 p.m. a couple nights ago. Uhhuh. And it was pretty much the entire company except you obviously. That's amazing. And um it escalates so quickly of you know people putting out ideas and stuff. Greg wrote that script. Yeah. And it was so perfectly off where it's like why would they name the games this way? And he was like, \"Do you have any notes?\" I'm like, \"No, you got to leave it exactly as it is.\" He then reached out to Roger Craig Smith, the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog, and he recorded the lines.

That's [\u00a0__\u00a0] insane. And Roger's entire workday while you were on content all day was making this fake trailer. You people are [\u00a0__\u00a0] insane. We decided to actively do this during the week of SGF at Twitch 2 launch week cuz I want you to know like even after I knew this was this I was like I was like did TM do a perfect Roger Craig Smith impression? I need you to know I was like I'm still to this point rattled by this a Tamolution. I can confirm this was a 9:30 p.m. Slack Tim where this all started two days ago. And I assume this started up again because I looked at Andy, I was like, \"No, it's real.\" And that that is my favorite part is Yeah. on uh on our Summer GameFest predictions episode, we we're you know, making our predictions and as always, we always say if we know something, we don't say it.

I have never seen your cocky ass come out like that. You're you're normally pretty humble and cool and chill about stuff. You're on the show like I know everything. I know everything.

Uh I had to run out of the room while y'all were uh doing the Games cast predictions and go to Roger and Joey be like, \"Hey, remember we we were supposed to [\u00a0__\u00a0] with Blessing? Uh we might need to start game planning that now.\" That's insane. And here we are. The fact that I stopped Andy from saying it. Yep. God damn. Amazing. God damn it. It's art.
