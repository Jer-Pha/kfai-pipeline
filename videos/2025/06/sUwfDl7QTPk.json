The first thing I wrote down was metaphor Refantasio. But here's the thing. The fact that they say that isn't Expedition 33 makes me wonder what\n on top of it. It sounds like\n Yeah. Like it's either they they've already played Expedition 33 or maybe they're not into Expedition 33. Oh, that's I think it's that they already I know I should play that.

And it's jumping between all these different um settings and it's more short stories that form a whole story, which I like. I like that is it's the kind of game where I treat it the way I watch Black Mirror, where it is, okay, there's a new season.

And so Live Alive I recommend especially for like the turn-based battle system. It's like grid based as well too. And so if you don't like that movement aspect of it, then maybe stay away. But I swear by the story and like the energy of it. And then Balders's Gate 3 is another one I really\n of course.\n Again, these are things where like I assume everybody's played Balders's Gate 3 or at least tried it out, but like if you haven't checked it out, if you're looking for a turn-based thing with excellent progression, like I cannot recommend that enough.\n A lot of people are calling on the Dragon Quest remakes here.

Sony is sticking to its guns and won't be releasing its first party games day one on its PlayStation Plus subscription service. Speaking with GameFile, vice president of global services at PlayStation Nick Maguire said the company was quote not looking to put games in Day and Date on PS+ and will instead stick with this current way of doing things. This is of course very different from Xbox which often puts big first party releases such as Indiana Jones and The Great Circle and many more on Game Pass from the get- go. Sony, meanwhile, has added some thirdparty games like the excellent blueprints and stray to PS+ on the same day as their initial launch. But the likes of God of War Ragnarok and Horizon Forbidden West, both from PlayStation's first party studios, weren't added to the service until around a year after their initial release.

Meguire continued before adding quote if there are six or seven great opportunities uh then we would go we would go for them as well end quote. When asked if the company had considered the benefit of putting its own firstp party live service titles on PS+ with Concord, the debut game from Sony's Firewalk Studios which has been taken offline 2 weeks after it PS5 and PC debut being used as an example.

This month, Remedy's multiplayer control spin-off FBC Fire Break was available to all those on PS+ extra and premium tiers day one. However, even when included on a subscription service, some live service games still flop. Square Enix's Foam Stars, for example. Flop for Foam Stars. What we talking about?
