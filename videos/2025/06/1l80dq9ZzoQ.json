I'm your one host, Greg Miller. Kind of funny's resident super fanboy as you are all well aware. I am sure I bid you a fair and welcome and healthy day. I hope you're having fun out there. I sure am because of course we are exactly one month from the brand new Superman motion picture starring David Kornsweet of course Rachel Broahan. Uh the one the only Nicholas Holt all by the one the only James Gunn. Uh if you have been following my 18-year journey on the internet you are no stranger to my obsession with the Man of Steel. I have loved Superman my entire life. don't have any recollection of when I found him the first time cuz it's been with me that long. Uh you've probably seen me nerd out talk about uh Superman and casting choices and all sorts of things here on youtube.com/kindfunny games. Maybe uh when I",

Maybe you've been with me since the Columbia Daily Tribune when I reviewed Superman Returns for them. They did a whole multimedia presentation on it too. Lost to the Ages. if you can find it. Good. I'd love to see it again. But they did a whole thing where they sent a photographer with me and I did a VO and there was like it was a whole thing. It was really cool. But yeah, that site's been changed a million times. But good luck looking into it. Uh, as I said, it is Wednesday, Jul. Uh, we are one month away from July 11th when you will see Superman.

So, you need to give it to somebody. Give it to us. Anyways, if you're an Amazon Prime member like myself, you may have bought tickets like I did to see Superman on July 8th. There's a lot going on as you know, but more importantly, there is a trailer here. This is all very kismmet because of course I had done today's Gregway about, hey, it is one month from Superman's release date.

And I will continue to consume and buy everything. I'm wasting so much money on this motion picture. I of course am currently planning to see it five times. And those are just the planned.

The Canadian Superman popcorn buckets are in fact uh these Daily Planet newspaper stands. Apparently, I'm going to need one of you Canadians to send me that. I will continue to burn money on Superman. This shirt, I bought it as soon as they put it up from dcccomics.com. And look it, it's already broken up. I will just keep buying them.

Uh, when you see Superman here on all fours, but upside down holding this building. This is one I've seen kicked around a lot in terms of screenshots. I think one of the TV spots is using it. I've stayed away from the TV spots. Don't need to do this.

Why would he punch that guy who his powers? Cuz, you know, I was thinking, is that Ultram Man, but it isn't because he's got the Luther core [\u00a0__\u00a0] on.

Oh, I know what I was get to. It's right up here in a second. Don't pause it yet, though. But we have an Ultram Man fight coming up here between Superman and he's using heat vision. He's using Heat Vision. Of course, as we've all talked about on these things, as you know, there's the Luther core guy. Lu, I'm sorry. Ultra Man, uh, comic-wise, usually just the mirror verse, you know, Earth 2, whatever, evil Superman. So, there's been so much conversation of who's going to be under the mask as Ultram Man. Is it just going to be David Corin sweat again with a different haircut when he pulls it off? Is it going to be Henry Caval, which a lot of people have been theorizing on again?

Maybe it is Bizaro. Maybe Lex cloned uh this Superman. That's who he's running as Ultram Man. The mask gets removed. It's him. And that sends him off to be. But I'm getting too into it.

The the chemistry, but these two have. You might say, Greg, you've only seen the trailer. How do you know their chemistry? Well, first off, the conversation in the last trailer, right, where she's interviewing him and he gets angry. I love that from a you're in a relationship and this is how it kind of works, right? as he goes into super mad mode, she goes into reporter mode, and then he gets mad cuz he's going into boyfriend mode, she's in girlfriend mode. But, uh, Entertainment Weekly put up yesterday, uh, a whole bunch of, they started putting out a whole bunch of stuff about Superman. Uh, and one of them was, uh, this scene of scene I use, it's, you know, a promo shot or whatever, but it's three phone booths next to each other.

I doubt that's what it is, of course, but something to that effect. Is it just kryptonite poisoning? You know, has he just broken out of the glass box we've seen him in before? I highly doubt that. That seems like he breaks out of that to have to stop the villain in the final third act. Uh, but still interested to see where this is again.

We have Metamorpho over there with many tendrils of Metamorpho, it looks like, coming out. So maybe Metamorpho had to sacrifice himself here. And then to the left, what that looks like?

It looked like Mr. Terrific and Lois were coming out of a ring very similar to that. So yeah, I got to imagine this is the Phantom Zone sucking in Metropolis.
