Okay, so maybe after in review we could do it while they stream somewhere in there and I don't need a lot of time from you. Basically though, for a second Switch too, do I need to make Ben an account or do we I want to go through pros and cons of him just using another game over Greg account? I'm gonna be honest. I actually don't know the answer with the Switch, too. Well, I got a lot of questions about it, so don't worry.

Um, but yeah, bouncing around through everything, whether it's the Gamecube games, the Switch One games being enhanced. Like, there's just a a lot of tinkering I've been doing. Obviously, getting a new console also means the the setup process for the theater and the setup process for the the handheld mode, and like just getting everything right, testing all the accessories, having fun, seeing what quirks you end up finding that you didn't think would be there.

How it can be. When I get my hands on the Wii for the first time, it's like, oh, it is a brand new experience. When I get when you get your hands relearn to play games. Yeah. Well, when you get your hands on the Switch one, it's like, whoa, like they made this brand new thing, right? Switch two was designed to be a boring jump in my opinion this time around as far as all right, you're getting better fidelity. Everything you loved better. Everything you loved better, right?

Like when I think back to the Xbox One, PS5, or think back to the Switch One where I'm like, I can't get my hands off this thing. for this for Switch 2. Honestly, like I'll pick it up to play Mario Kart and like usually I'll be with my friends or with whoever, right? I'm playing Mario Kart and then once I put it down, I'm like, \"All right, cool. Now, let's lock back in on playing Death Stranding 2 or let's, you know, lock in on playing like Elder Ring Night Rain with Andy and Mike or doing something else.\" Like, I'm not as attached by um to the hip or attached by the hip to this thing as much as I would have thought before this coming out.

Do you think that's a symptom of how much you enjoyed Switch One? Follow my line of thinking on this. My uh week with this Switch 2 has been fantastic. I've played it a ton. Ben is playing it a ton. There's so much to unpack here in terms of how much fun I'm having with this device and how much I I would say I love this device, right? Which isn't shocking cuz everybody loves Switch One, but I loved Switch One and then really fell off of Switch One where even when I was loving the original Switch, it was, \"Oh, I'm going on a flight. I'm playing this or I'm doing this or it's Zelda or it's Mario, right? It was these big games that were tent poles.\" So, I never I don't feel like I ever lived in the Switch ecosystem kind of thing, right?

I couldn't even tell you what it was or what I would have committed to or what I would have put serious hours into. So, for me, jumping into Switch 2 and going to Link's Awakening, playing cart with y'all, playing cart with Ben, being like, \"Oh, man. I can't wait. Oh, Pokemon would have been it. I can't wait to get back and finish Pokemon now that it runs well.\" Like, I it's a new system to me in the way of obviously it's new and it's it feels great and there's all these little things to it, but it's also, man, oh man, I forgot how much I liked Switch.

I've already played those like I've already had those like those experiences and it's neat to boot up Tears of the Kingdom and be like, \"Oh man, this runs so much better.\" But I'm not as incentivized to like hop all the way into that experience new to play. Yeah. Like I'm looking for for new games and Mario Kart World has been that. That brings me to my second thing, which is I I think I've come back around to this launch lineup just not being as exciting as like maybe I perceived it being going in because I thought Mario Kart World was going to like really carry it as far as like me being all in on it.

But for me, Mario Kart, if you're not going to get if you're going to have that open world part of it and it not it's not going to be as filled to the brim with things to do and if it's going to be way more empty to put it bluntly, right? Like I then my experience turns into okay well this is a thing I'm going to play with friends after I've done all the Grand Prix which I have. Um, and no, a humble brag. Humble brag, which I'm sure most people at this point probably have Donald Grand Prix. But like, you know, I that can't really carry my experience with a launch.

I think I needed like one more bigger first party thing. Like I wish Donkey Kong Bonanza was at launch. I understand why it's not because they don't want that to be cannibalized by Mario Kart, but that would have done so much more for me. I've seen that tenor of discussion out there in the general BS world. That's Blue Sky Tim. Uh where people are saying like they needed a single player game. I think you know blah blah blah.

Like again, the fact the reason the fact that I fasted on Switch One because I never reviewed Switch games. So, I was I was always reviewing something on PlayStation or Xbox or PC, right? And then I'll get to that Switch game later and I never did because the conversation would pass me by. Da da. I have a whole library of things I'm excited to get to. But Tim, you are Mr. Nintendo around here. You've been playing every day. What have you been filling your hours with? Uh, I mean, it's been a lot of Mario Kart.

Uh so yeah, I'm I'm having a great time having a lot of fun playing by myself, but then also the magic of the the launch. Like I haven't had a launch experience as fun as the last week or last couple days of all of us playing together maybe ever, you know? Like it was awesome to have that. And uh to me like the Switch 2 just delivered what I needed it to, which is 4K and HDR and just it runs games well. I already love these games like Bless was saying. Like it's hard for me because I am not fully ready to jump back into starting another Breath of the Wild save or like I I've had these experiences so there's not much for me to like",

I do wish that the open world had more substantial things to do. And I guess even my bigger problem with it is like a clearer path to completion. Um like a more Ubisoft style checklist type thing I I feel is lacking from that for for the way I play these games. Um but going into the Switch 2 and what my expectations have been, it's very similar to the last couple console launches period. Like I think that this is exactly like the PS5 launch or the Xbox Series launch where really what do we get from them? Oh, it just runs the things better, you know. But to me, the biggest thing is the Switch is now getting Nintendo games to a status they have to be. Whereas the PS5 is",

I think I'm the biggest Dual Sense fan that there is. But the haptics and all that stuff, it's a nice to have as opposed to a I think bare necessity of the game [\u00a0__\u00a0] runs uh in 4K visuals cuz that's what TVs are nowadays. So for Nintendo to have that jump up, I'm thrilled with that and that's kind of all that I need. But like I think back to the for everyone that's like, \"Oh, it's just a Switch Pro.\" I'm like, \"First off, that's not a complaint.\" And second off, I'm like I think about the Xbox. Like it literally the Xbox Series X like going from the one to the X, it's like, yeah, it's faster and has all these like little features and stuff, but it's not like I was playing a game that like was changing my life or anything.

And looking at what we already have as a roadmap for Switch 2, I'm like, yo, I'm I'm sitting pretty. Like I can't wait for the next couple months of these games to to with come out, whether they're new like Donkey Kong or just more content for Kirby. Would you say that about like the PlayStation 5's library as well at launch as far as like not really having something else pulling pulling you in as much? Well, PS5 had Astros Playroom which spoke very loudly to me and I absolutely loved that and I platinumed it and uh Miles Morales which I mean you know had Bug Snacks which is not not for me but again had Miles Morales, right?

Like there was a long list of games that I was just looking like all in on. And for me here so far with the Switch, there are like three games that interest me and they are Mario Kart, Delta Rune, and Soulcalibur 2, right? Like I feel like that's a tough thing. And even with like with Xbox, right, like you at least had the third party stuff to really bolster that as far as like Vajala and I think it was Yakuz like a dragon was an Xbox One or Xbox Series X launch title as well.

And again, that just comes down to like looking at the PS5's launch, it's like a lot of games like I don't care about. And uh having said that, I think Miles Morales is a better game than Mario Kart World. So like I'm not saying that the Switch 2 had a better launch than PS5.

Like, I wanted those mini games to actually be fun. And my experience with it, it has not been fun. So, yeah, this is not my No, the price is not the the price is a problem for sure for that, but the price is not the game's problem. The game has ways that I think uh it's sterile. It's just not fun.

Right? And so then you get into this conversation of how Nintendo seems and it seems all the rumors have been true of they really kept the dev units to themselves, right?

So yeah, it doesn't feel like a toy in any way, which I I think is a very un Nintendo thing, but that's good. I think it's a good step forward. And the Pro Controller 2 I obsessed with.

But, we need it to keep going. I I think to double back on my point, right, because I do have people are coming at me in chat a little bit, right? I I don't disagree with Barrett in the point of when we talk about our video game reviews and how I feel about the new Call of Duty or how I feel about the new Spider-Man game. I don't look at success as far as the bar for is this thing good, you know, like that's not the way you review a thing. You review a thing based off of is do you like the art?

I can say that, but business-wise, that just doesn't align with the reality of what the Switch 2 is doing and what the Switch 2 is, right?
