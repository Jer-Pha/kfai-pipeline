Bless.\n I'm very excited.\n Officially tomorrow.\n 10 excellent throws away. I had to do 999. I am 10 away. It will happen at Greg's parade.\n That's of course\n there'll be a lot of people to celebrate you. It's a great consolation prize. You know what I mean?\n Yeah.

I'll put it on my avatar and then I will have Greg put it on my back.\n I like that. Nothing can go wrong with that plan.\n Wow. Of course, that's WWE legend Greg Miller. Hello, Blessing. How are you?\n I'm doing well. I do like seeing that belt.\n It's h I'm happy to have it.

My favorite thing about the belt that we don't talk enough about is that it's broken in.\n I hate when you see the straps at a WWE event.

Uh, while the older Melgary games were laotted for their creative gameplay, 1998's Metal Gear Solid on PlayStation took that innovation and creativity to the next level at the time. Its cinematic storytelling techniques were considered second to none. Its interactive movie-l like presentation demonstrating Kojima's love and understanding of cinema. Uh, and then it goes on about the plot. But there you go. Congratulations to Metal Gear Solid 1. See, this is what I This is what I was talking I said earlier Matt was drinking alcohol out of a plum.

It's tough to [\u00a0__\u00a0] up a Cojima list cuz it's the MCU thing of like you know what the top five are. like you know what the top what the cream of the crop are and then you kind of have tiers. I think they got the tiers right. I MGS4 is a wild one to me where I think having that game that low is kind of crazy but also I get it. I get not liking certain aspects of certain games and how that would get get you there. I'm going to say thumbs up. I think this list is good.\n I'll give it the thumbs up. Yeah.
