            "text": "30 minutes with my hands on the sticks. My main takeaway from my preview is that one, this game is early. Um, this game might be niche compared to a Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, but I do think that this game will find its place. I think this game, from my limited time with it, was very fun to play. I like it visually. I like it conceptually. I totally understand the concern around Invincible as an IP. Is there enough meat there to garner a community of like a fighting game based community? Is this the right direction? I think it is. I think that with the characters you have here and the team you have working on it, that's the place to start with it.",
