I'm doing well. How are you? I'm great. Has this notebook shown up on content? Did Did you bring it out on the preview? I don't I don't remember. I did bring it up. I was listening, I guess, I just forgot. This is an amazing notebook. Hold this up. Look at this. It's a It's a little Death Stranding thing they gave you when you were at Kajjima Productions previewing it. Yeah. This is one of those ones where I I I mentioned this on one of the preview things, right?

Um but yeah, they gave us these notebooks and so all my notes are in here and it's funny, I didn't take any more notes for the review. Uh and so uh I when I got in cuz I had left this in the office, I was like, \"You know what? I'll just use my notes from the preview because I don't think much has changed. Spoilers. Um, but like I just started reading these and I'm like, \"Oh man, I took a lot of notes and a lot of them are it's funny just looking back.\" Give me the funniest one you've seen so far.

Talk to me about those 80 hours then from a top level is that so that's obviously main quest, but how much side stuff did you do? Where did your time start getting lost? I started taking my time back from the game. And that's not a negative way of saying it. Like I want it to take more of my time. We'll get to that later. But probably about 30 to 40% of the game I've started going just mainlining more uh the main missions in the game. But be beyond that, were you just doing all side stuff? Were you building roads?

Okay. Yeah. Blessing. Yes. How many hours are you in Death Stranding 2 and have you rolled credits? I have rolled credits. Um, so it's gonna be fun talking about this because I did the preview at Cojima Productions a couple months ago, right, where they allowed us to play up to 30 hours of the game. Um, so this playthrough, the review playthrough, I rolled credits at around probably closer to 45 hours of playing. Um, if I combine that with my preview, then we're talking about probably closer to 70 hours of playing overall. But for this playthrough, it took me about 45 hours to roll credits. Okay.

I'm going to read one uh excerpt from my review notes to kind of sum it up. Um, I said this because this is a rare direct sequel from Cojima. It feels reactive to any and all criticism of Death Training 1. The combat is fun and engaging. It gets you into the game quicker. There's more dynamic weather and obstacles. There's uh there's more tools and upgrade systems. The story feels easier to follow and more interesting. It's more beautiful. It's bigger. The soundtrack is better. There's more variety in the BTS and the ways to deal with them. There's a glossery system akin to active time lore which makes easier the story easier to follow. And I all that is still echoed here, right? I think the game is still doing the thing of all right direct seagull.

The one other excerpt I'm going to take from my preview notes is this. As buck wild the rules of this universe are, there is such conceptual and emotional buyin from those crafting this story that I can't help but to buy in myself. Death rating 2 plays so strongly by the rules of the first game. I'm emotional from an early on speech about beaches. And I think for me playing it in this review playthrough, that's the thing that shines most is Death Training one when I think I first played it in when most of us when we all first played Death Training One. I think one of the main takeaways was, \"Oh, this world is weird. Oh, this the Kojima is is like going full Kojima. Oh, this game is bizarre.\" All that [\u00a0__\u00a0] right? Oh,",

Oh, beaches, BTS, BB, like all that [\u00a0__\u00a0] playing it this time around, I like I can't believe how much buy in that I have into the universe that they've crafted here where they're talking about the Cairo Network and like crazy things that go on with the Chyro Network and I'm sitting there like, \"Yeah, I I I get that. That's weird.\" Like that's that's interesting. Like I'm fully into what they're doing narratively here. And I think it works because it's fully in on what it's doing, but then also they really use the world to uplift the characters. And this time around, I think the characters really shine. I I don't know if I have a favorite character. Maybe maybe I'll say Troy Baker's performance as Higs is like my favorite performance in this game. It's [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome. Um, but",

Like I love this cast so much and I think narratively the themes that they're tackling, the tone that they have, like I think it's really unique. I think it's really interesting. I think it's really special. Gameplaywise, it's more Destiny, but in all the best ways where they have figured out how to make this the best um truck simulator meets um like you know, third person action game in the weirdest world possible that they could have made.

Metal Gear Solid 3 was my first Cojima game that I um digested and I to say that I'm like Death Stranding was like one of the first games obviously doing his own thing and I just fell in love with just how weird it was and the story overall like really hit with me. And I also I'm not the most exciting person in video games when you're like the play style like I could do a walking simulator which was a lot of people talking about the first game.

I enjoy the the Death Stranding is a vibe and it helps you like sit and reflect with what you actually got going on in your life or with Sam in the game. For Death Ring 2, I think the fix was the pacing of it all. And primarily like for me, I can recommend now recommend Death Stranding 2 to someone that hasn't played the first game and it be okay. And I'll get to that in just a second because it gets you into the world much sooner. They equip you with tools that are introduced at the right points of the game depending on what area you're in, depending on what part of the story. The narrative is tied into that, too. Like you're introduced and fed at the right points. And it encourages you like it. I feel like I am empowered as a player to try new weapons, to go to this new area that looked a little nerve-wracking. I don't know if I want to go over there yet. I know",

Still don't love them in this game either, but I felt more empowered to not shy away from those experiences. But overall, like I think the the fixing of the pacing, the introduction of the narrative, and how they sort of set you up for success based on that next mission is really well done. and it's way easier to follow. I think this is going to be more of a hit with more people now. But yeah, it's the the learning curve of this world is intimidating, especially if you haven't played the first game, but they do a lot of things to help with that. What's your score? 9.5.

Cuz we still didn't know, we didn't understand what Death Stranding was. There's so much bending over backwards and to start Death Stranding 2 on the beach and be tossed right back into it of the Chairo Network, the BTS, this like there's no handholding like there is, you know, we talked so much about Final Fantasy 16, right? And active time lore. The fact that they have their little glossery every time it pops up, you can hold down your start button, right? You can go right in, read it, you can go back there. When you come back to the game after a full restart of the game,",

So, it's like for me right now with an asterisk not being I mean I'll beat it in two after the kind of funny podcast. I'm going to sit down and beat the game, right? I'd be leaning towards 8.5, but I'm also hot on the ending as I build to the ending.

Like, you know, this is always such an interesting thing where we're reviewing these games, we want to stay quiet to each other, but then you also hold so much in. And so outside when it was just me and Nick out there, he was like, \"Oh man, like you know Tim sucks.\" I'm like, \"I know he does because Tim's not in the office.\" He's like, \"We got to stop making fun of Tim.\" I'm like, \"No, no, we don't. I sent Tim a video from Death Stranding on Sat on Friday night and he didn't even respond to I want you to watch it.\" And I start playing this video and Nick's just watching goes, \"This is insane.\" And I'm like, \"I know.

And I've plenty of criticisms on it, but I found myself even in the car talking about it. I would make the criticism and then go back to like what the mission statement of the game is, like what what is he trying to say? What is he trying to do here? So, for the things that bump up against me here and, you know, 40 plus hours of it, like it's a great game. I think it's a great great game. I'll be interested to see when I finally roll credits and obviously go back and plot through some more side stuff what I'm going to feel like because I still want to go I I still think some of the most interesting stuff I've seen is the end of those individual threads with the individual people who need you and stuff like that.

I guess where I would want to start is the question of blessing. Yeah. What was your style of gameplay? Uh when we launched Gamescast as a daily product, one of the things we always said was it'll be so great to read other people's reviews and talk to and talk to each other of how this happened and that. And so reading Simon Cardi on IGN today, reading Midler over at VGC, it was interesting how they tackled situations. How did you play Death Stranding?

And after I unlocked that truck, that was the way I navigated the map most of the time. Like I've been I've been on the Mario Kart stream we did last week, I was saying a lot of like, \"Hell yeah, brother.\" And like honestly that's my character in Desert Raining too.

Um I definitely in the first game like I was always hesitant to jump in like I didn't really engage in like the mule camps at all because I just always got my butt kicked and I was like I'm they're messing up my deliveries. They're beating up my packages. I don't want to do that. Um but with Destination 2, I feel that I've had tools given to me or at least incorporated like how I might go about doing this.

So, like, let me take them out from a distance or let me trick them and use some of that stealth action to save this uh this camp or get whatever materials I'm going to get. But overall, yeah, like I do love just walking around in this world so much. But that's where it starts taking time. And that's just part of that's the vibe. you know, you might not want to invest this much time into a game, but if you do and you enjoy that, you're going to have an amazing, but you don't have to.

Um, but I will say like yeah, like overall like it's you can play pretty much any way you want to play. I like to explore this world cuz it is so pretty though. Like it's a really good world, especially compared to Dust Running One. I'm playing on PS5 Pro and I stayed in quality mode the whole time, baby. I did. I normally am a performance gal. Yeah, listen.

It's a push and pull of then you could do it your way and tackle this, you could do that. You know, BTS, I'm right there with you, Jerica. Like, game one, I never enjoyed fighting them. Death Stranding two, I also don't enjoy fighting them. So, I was the same way of like, cool, going out. Let's get the blood grenades.

I need to fit like that part of it I never did. So, like when I started experimenting this time and I got the big cruiser truck and I put on all the extra batteries, it was like, cool, I'm driving this thing everywhere, picking up every piece of cargo, dropping it off all the way, you know, to trying to go to the specific places to get more",

Go back to your base. Go back to the thing. usually get to, you know, go to sleep in your deal. You wake up like and then you wait there, sit on the bed, somebody barks in order in at you of what's going on. You go up to the terminal, again, it's a lot of terminals this time around. Even the holograms, even the people, you know, the people that you're",

And I get all of that, but it didn't in those in terms of the grand scheme of it, it didn't drive home, I think, the narrative plot point to me of like, hey, we're all disconnected from each other and this is a problem as much as it drove home like, oh, this is a cheaper, faster way to do a video game of this person's AI giving me the mission and me going off and doing it rather than me coming back for the big Cojima cutscene that I'd expect, right, of here they all are and they're talking, they're interacting.

And it felt left me feeling isolated, but I don't think in the isolated Death Stranding way. Isolated in the it's just I'm staring at Norman Reus while we go deliver these packages to this person. I I I I find that fascinating because like I think the routine that you're talking about is part of what makes the experience for me.

And I like that because I think routine helps to kind of cement that experience in a video game. But at the same time, I'm also somebody who's really interested in what's going on narratively. And so like I ended up mainlining a lot of this game because I was so fascinated with the story, but I was also sad about mainlining at the same time because I also just want to exist in the world.

So, it sounds like from hearing your perspectives on that, like what what could have we seen more of like or situations that maybe Sam could have been in where we get more of those moments?

Like, what could we have gotten more? I think there could have been more talking to Lou. There could have been more talking of being a father. There could have been more of an emotional resonance core there where again it feels like it's Norman Reedus like Norman Reedus has been told he has a baby. All right, great.

So when you're in bed, you can turn and talk to him and he'll say something or this. And I also think he talks too much in a lot.

It's a it's a part two that is doing the rare Kojima thing of just being able to look at all the feedback, looking at look at everything and go, \"All right, let's make this better.

The world feels like way more alive uh in this one. I think a lot of that is like the like all the weather system stuff that you're talking about, right? Where if it um sometimes when it rains the water levels in the the rivers will rise which changes how you need to navigate the environment because a ladder might not work to get you across that river. We might need a bridge this time, which I think is really smart. You have like sandstorms and stuff that'll come through and like, you know, create a way more aggressive environment.

I do think there'd be ways to make that less frictionist. Like when I want to skip the [\u00a0__\u00a0] cut scene of putting it in to deliver it to the guy, don't make me hit the button and then it goes resume or skip. I'm like, let me skip or whatever.

Cuz one of the things we talked so much about in the original review was Andy saying, \"Oh, you got to be online for this. It's such a better experience to see this.\" And even in the beginning here where it was like, \"Oh, Yong built this station. Thanks, Yong.\" You know what I mean? Like that little thing. Granted, it won't always be like that cuz you know, we're going to see strangers out there. That's so funny cuz Yeah.

Like Yojo Shinawa has been a longtime collaborator with Kjima and like you know we know him for the art of Metal Gear and all that stuff. I think he continues to kill it here. Like obviously a lot of this is taken from Death Stranding one, but I I will forever be impressed when I'm looking at um Sam Porter Bridges and I see like him I see like you know a package hanging off the left arm, another one off the right arm, like you know, shoes dangling a big old",

I don't remember anything really beyond that that got me. And then playing this one, I'm in the same boat of just like the combat for me isn't the thing in Death Stranding. I It is better, sure, but it is still like I don't even know it's better. Uh, one of the other let downs for me was like we talked I know this is very top level but like oh um uh Neil's just like uh Mads Mickelson so you already know what the Mad Mickelson's fights were like.

I for me it's it's the gameplay versus the spectacle of it. Cuz I think spectacle-wise, the boss fights are like nine out of 10 or 10 out of 10.

That is why I'm at a 9.5 and not out of 10 is some of the combat and some of the interactions that you have.

But I feel like they're building a game that's trying to appeal to everyone all at once, even though they say they're not.

I think I would have loved to see more outside the box thinking as far as like you know when I think about my favorite Kuima boss fights I think about Psycho Mantis, right, which was like you know having to figure out like oh unplug the thing, replug it and then uh the end which is way more cerebral and way more of a sniper",

This is our chance to answer your questions based on all the reviews you're saying of Death Stranding 2 today. Of course, YouTube.comkindfunname.

I do wish there was like a capture all button and maybe y'all correct me. I couldn't select all, but I could select all, but I couldn't like put it all in a different spot or when you're picking up cargo.

Icy Weiner says, \"Can you speak to how female characters are treated?\" This is a conversation that I've seen obviously as the the discussion and discourse begins today. Yeah, this is a fun one because like a lot of my immediate group of friends don't love Cojima games because they don't love the depiction of female characters oftentimes in Cojima games, which I think is very understandable, especially when you look at like quiet quiet and like, oh, she dresses like that cuz she breathes through her skin, right?

But I'm also like having played all the Metal Gear Solids, I'm like, \"Oh, but like there's some really good female characters in in Metagar Solid 2, but also I totally understand where you're coming from.\" I think in this ca in this game, and I want to hear Jer Jerica's answer more than my answer, honestly, so I'll answer quick. I really like the core cast of women uh in this game. Um, in fact, I like their vibe and I like their presence more than normal. Um, I agree with that. But Derrick, what do you think? I totally agree.

So yeah, I think they all the women in this game have something very important they're working through and just like it's a you know, everyone talking through emotions and grief and how humans sort of overcome that and find partnerships. So that's all I'll say. But yes, I think uh Ragel's uh role has been elevated and I can't wait for you to see how that evolves with the other characters. Yeah, it's good. I think even uh Sam's jealous of some of his friendships have come out of the like on the show and he's like always making comments like, \"Oh, I wish I could join.\" There's like such a third wheel vibe to a lot of different things which are cute and like again like really great in terms of what",

Yeah, I haven't I have not done Well, I haven't I haven't dealt in those settings, but like I definitely agree with him. Yeah. Uh Mad Dog Nick 96 says, \"Would you say the trailers have spoiled anything?\" The trailers. Yes. Yeah. Always. Is it spoiled anything or is it just laid out these breadcrumbs that like when you're playing something and you they introduce somebody, you're like, \"Oh, I know that person because I've seen them.\" I think it's it's because of the nature of death training like everything is so weird and like you really don't know what you're seeing until you have context around it.

But like for me watching SGF and being like 20 hours into the game watching that cut scene I was like oh interesting. Even stuff they were showing here I was like haven't seen that yet. So I can imagine I'm about to see that. You know, like I like there's nothing I'm the And once y'all play the game, you'll understand. There is nothing I understand less than why they showed that scene at SGF. Yeah, it's such a bizarre scene to show, especially knowing all the other scenes you could have shown at SGF. That would have been way more hype. That would have been way less like spoilery. Yeah, it's it's a weird one. We'll see. Uh David N.

Find like another video like recap. IGN's done a bunch. I know. Just something that's a little bit more lengthier. But yeah, I think you definitely could get more from the story than the little snippet they give you at the beginning of the game. Yeah. Yeah. There's a bunch out there right now that I think you'd be and yes, I think you could do that and be fine.

Half his DNA is Lex Luthther. That's Super Boy right We got a we got a you got a stew going on. God. Fair enough. Uh what do we got in terms of closing thoughts on Death Stranding 2, Jericho? Well, I'm so glad it exists. I think it does push the envelope in a lot of different ways, which Cojima is known for, but that's why I'm glad it exists because I think there's things that can be influenced by this game.

And yeah, Death Rating 2. So far, one of my favorite games of the year and once again, it made me cry a little bit a couple times and then that one scene was just so badass and I cried. Yeah, you'll have to see when you get to that part. Yo, it's good. Yeah, I agree with Jericho as far as like I it's up there as one of my favorite games of the year.
