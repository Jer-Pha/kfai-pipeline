This is the studio responsible for some of the most iconic game franchises ever. So, to see them announce Intergalactic: The Heretic Profit is naturally going to get us all hyped up. Naughty Dog working on something spacey. Ooh, something religious. Ah, and yes, while teasing us with the Trent Resner score, product placements, Akira and Cowboy Bbop vibes, and prominent voice actors, I'm sure got us all feeling a wide range of emotions. But for me, it was weirdly seeing the Naughty Dog logo at the end that hit me with a level of nostalgia I wasn't expecting.

I've tackled Zelda, Persona, God of War, and a few other franchises. And while I love making videos like these, I eventually got burnt out and told myself after a while that I was done, retired, more or less. But the nostalgic hit of that Naughty Dog logo sparked something in me. And before I even realized what I was doing, I had downloaded every Naughty Dog game onto my PS5 the day after the Game Awards. And then when I had all of the games downloaded, it really hit me that Naughty Dog has been present for my entire gaming lifetime. And I didn't even realize it while growing up. I was brought back to my babysitter's house where I played hours and hours of Crash Bandicoot, my middle school home, where I discovered the wonderful world of Jack and Dexter, and the first apartment I lived in with my wife playing The Last of Us for the very first time.

But this time, I I don't want this video to be about ranking these video games. Instead of comparing Crash Bandicoot to The Last of Us, let's instead focus on the journey. And obviously, like most of my videos, the spoiler gloves are off. So, maybe finish up Jack Combat Racing before I dive into its complex themes. Now, I know some of you hardcore dog fans out there are going to yell at me when I start this up and I don't talk about anything pre- Crash Bandicoot. And for that, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry the headline lied to you and I have brought shame upon my name, but come on. We all know the studios legacy truly started to get going with the PlayStation one. [Music] The first Crash Bandicoot is the one I actually have the least nostalgia for, but funnily enough, it's the one I've probably replayed the most as an adult. I would say it's objectively the worst of the original Crash games simply because it was the first one in an era where developers were trying to figure out how to adapt platformers from the boring and old 2D space to the new and exciting 3D space. It's wild to think that Crash 1 came out just weeks before Mario 64 release in America back in 1996. They each took such different approaches to 3D platforming and it was",

They each took such different approaches to 3D platforming and it was obvious which game became the godfather of 3D platformers. Yahoo! Yes, Mario 64 may have blown the coot out of the water, but there is still a charm to the more simplistic approach Naughty Dog took with Crash. Instead of sprawling levels where you could traverse anywhere and any way you wanted, Crash literally just took the linear 2D platformer design and made it 3D. You jump over gaps, spin attack enemies, and run to the end of a linear level while breaking every box you can find, or they break you. The biggest shakeup in design and gameplay was just which perspective you, the player, we're playing from. And Jesus Christ, there are so many perspectives and all of the axes.

Look, it was 1996. Naughty Dog was on the cutting edge of new video game technology like the Z-axis. They were learning. And honestly, for a game that's nearly 30 years old, it's impressive how much it does hold up. While the gameplay is stiff compared to the later entries, and some of the level design feels just off enough that it doesn't quite support the stiff gameplay, I noticed there was still a design philosophy to subtly teach the player how to deal with certain obstacles and then upping the ante with more complicated versions of those obstacles later on, which every platformer with a solid foundation has had since Super Mario Brothers.

Except those two bridge levels, those can get [\u00a0__\u00a0] You combine that with the simple yet equally annoying boss fights, Crash Bandicoot was a solid first entry for Naughty Dog in the 3D realm and obviously did well enough for Sony to approve two sequels and a spin-off.

H. You travel from island to island, fighting other anthropomorphic animals, weird little robots, and questionably designed native islanders to seek justice. With the help of Akuaku, you kick Cortex's butt and ride off into the sunset with the most humanl lookinging bandicoot I've ever seen in my life. That's the entire plot.

The environments, music, linear level design, and simple environmental storytelling across both the levels and overworld map all help in making you have this sense of momentum. Exploring a treacherous yet exciting and fun world, which we definitely saw the studio iterate on for the next couple of decades. It is a poorly aaged game, but it's an important one that led us to the likes of Jack and Daxter and Uncharted.

This game had an advantage the first one didn't, to take influence from the competition. There is an alternate reality where Crash 2 had more sprawling levels, a fully explorable hub world, more freedom and movement and discoverability. But no, Naughty Dog stuck to their guns with Crash 2, and I respect the hell out of that. So many times we've seen trend chasing that sometimes works out, but for the most part doesn't.

Something else you could feel Naughty Dog wanting to add more to was the story and world. Crash has a sister now. Cortex needs Crash's help. Akuaku is still kind of just there. The story is pretty much just kick Cortex's ass again, but it could have just been straightforward like the first game, adding the not so subtle twists of Cortex manipulating you into collecting crystals, bosses from the first game getting little follow-ups that make sense, and Embryo returning with a vendetta for Cortex shows that the team wanted to have fun building out these characters and this world.

If you remember from the first Crash, to progress, you really just had to beat the level. But if you wanted to go above and beyond, you could collect gems in every level by destroying every box, which would give you a slightly alternate ending with your model Bandicoot girlfriend. And as someone who has never had the interest in going all out and bashing my head against Wampa of fruit boxes, I always felt like I was kind of missing out. The fact that in Crash 2 you have to walk away from every level with a collectible gives a new level of satisfaction. Are these crystals participation trophies? 100% yes.

Now, as an adult, see, this is where constantly going back to replay video games, one of the things I'm known for, becomes a double-edged sword. While I get to go back, appreciate, and find new things to take away from the art, I can also just as easily see how something doesn't hold up as well. And Crash Bandicoot Warps is one of those moments where my adult brain can't look past so many things. The primary one being that it's kind of more of the same of Crash 2, but simpler. You have the same core type of levels now with less challenge. You have the same exact collectibles, and you have a few new gimmicky levels that are neat ideas, but don't feel fully fleshed out.

Now maybe it's because I played all three of the games in the span of like 4 days but at the end of this adventure I was getting tired of the crash formula which after a total of 12 hours of gameplay was starting to feel stale.

Their reward for that becoming a Call of Duty support studio, which real quick, I'm glad that that team is still around and freed themselves from Activision and Xbox because if they didn't, who knows if they'd still be around at all. Anyways, back to Naughty Dog.

[Music] Continuing the insane production timeline of the Crash games, Naughty Dog would release Crash Team Racing in October 1999. not even a full year later after Crash Warped. And it would be the final Crash game that Naughty Dog worked on since they would soon be bought out by Sony while Universal Interactive would keep the rights to our favorite Orange Mercupial.

Look, it was probably only Banjo, but just let me believe that Donkey Kong 64 somehow inspired Naughty Dog.

Having both the first game and this one available to me back to back was a dream come true. A fun 3D platformer collectathon that was reminiscent of Donkey Kong 64 and a gritty sequel set in a dystopian city that plays more like GTA. I remember loving the story, world, and explorable city that made me feel so immersed.

The memories of driving around on futuristic speeders, shooting metal heads, making friends, finding love, and experiencing the twist and turns of Jack's fate were some of my favorites growing up. And for the longest time, a good friend of mine kept telling me I was wrong, that Jack 2 actually sucked and it played horribly.

To reiterate, Jack 2 kind of stepped away from what Jack 1 was all about. You're no longer collecting orbs in themes levels interconnected together while platforming and punching your way through obstacles. This time, you're getting missions from characters, doing specific tasks for them, like escorting cargo throughout Haven City, going through the slums to shoot and kill a bunch of metal heads, or doing sick tricks on your hoverboard because Tony Hawk was also hot at the time.

Now, these linear missions themselves aren't anything really to write home about. You're mainly shooting through waves of uninteresting enemies to get an item a character requested or blow something up, etc. And for a game that decided to focus more on shooting rather than platforming, the shooting is fine.

In chasing the GTA high, Naughty Dog sacrificed what Jack and Dexter originally was, a solid 3D platformer. Now, was that the wrong decision for the time? probably not. It was praised by critics and fans at the time and got more attention than it probably would have if it stuck to being just a 3D platformer.

All still works and key moments were still effective. It's a more mature, edgy story while also keeping some of the levity from the first game. And in that sense, I do think it succeeds at being a sequel to Jack and Dexter while chasing the success of Grand Theft Auto.

And yes, while there are weird choices like sidelining Kira Jack's love interest from the first two games and making Ashlin a last second love interest for some reason, there is a lot that still had me way more invested in the story than I expected.

This universe and story overall had the sauce and showcased that Naughty Dog wasn't just growing in gameplay, but storytelling as well.

But going through their catalog now, it's not as surprising. What is still surprising to this day is the jump from Jack X to Uncharted 1. Obviously, the jump from PS2 to PS3 was a major one and gave studios much more power to work with thanks to the cell processor. And while yes, Uncharted 1 today technically is dated on a visual level, processing what Naughty Dog was able to accomplish in 2 years still hits.

Okay, maybe not that extreme, but you get the idea. And this is where I bring back Amy Henig.

They fight a bunch of pirates led by two very generic villains who want El Dorado for nefarious reasons. Discover El Dorado is not a city, but a cursed golden statue that turns people into wind-like monsters and ultimately decide to make sure it never reaches civilization to prevent the world from falling into chaos.

The two of them having a subtle romantic thing grow between them throughout. Or Sully's just ridiculous charm.

And I honestly think it's because of how strong the story side of the game is. If you play this game coming off of Jack 3, there's honestly not too much of a difference. It's a serviceable meld of platforming and gunplay with the biggest differences being that shooting is heavily coverbased now instead of chaotically running and gunning.

And returning to this game, it hit me that I don't really care.

Maybe starting this 2 days after Uncharted 1 put things into perspective. Or maybe I just let the things I didn't like last time take over the things I really do like from this game.

So much about Uncharted 2 makes the first one feel quaint, which is why I think it stands out so much in the trilogy.

There's no downtime to make the next sequence feel exciting. Pacing of a game is tricky, and I want to break that down real quick by using the roller coaster example grade schoolers are shown when taught about basic story structure.

That's why roller coasters usually don't drop you longer than like 5 seconds. The exhilaration would start to fade. And that's Uncharted 2's third act to me. Once you get back to the village with the homie Tenzin, it's all action until you get to Shambala. I would have traded in an hour of that action for just five more minutes of moments like these.

Naughty Dog really stepped it up overall with this game with everything I said earlier, but also with level design, which is much more interesting with how much you can play around during gunfights.

Anyways, to wrap this up, despite some small bumps in the road, Uncharted 2 is a fantastic time. And returning to it, I now see why it would still be some people's favorite in the series. It established so much that we love and did it in such a huge way, and you still feel its influence on so many games today. And even though I appreciate this game more this time around, I do wonder if it holds a candle to my personal favorite in the PS3 trilogy.

With how good these games still look today, it's honestly crazy in retrospect that they were able to come out so close together. And that's not even mentioning how The Last of Us comes out just two years after this. From 96 to 2020, Naughty Dog released 15 games. And their biggest gap of not releasing a new title has been from The Last of Us Part Two to now. It really makes you think if the advancements in graphics, the push for devs to make live service games, and making games longer is really worth it at the expense of output.

But this time, I've had to really think about the Uncharted trilogy as a whole to dig deeper into my thoughts here, and they're more complicated this time around. In terms of gameplay, Uncharted 3 feels like a solid enough iteration to Uncharted 2. And for many people, I can see why it's not as striking as Uncharted 2's giant leap from the first game. There are still big set pieces that feel a bit understated this time around. The gunplay feels mostly the same. Climbing around feels a bit more formulaic with all the scripted ledges falling apart.

And granted, the sinking ship sequence and falling out of a giant plane are still fun and tense in the moment, but something I couldn't help but notice was the context around these big moments and how they're presented. The train from Uncharted 2 is excellent because at first you're given it without context. So, while the stakes are unknown, they're still incredibly high and part of the fun is catching up in the story to see how Nate got there.

The main thing driving you towards all of this is the main pirate threatening to kill Sully, which is such an obvious lie that it makes me question if Nate is a smart person. You go through this entire sequence kind of for nothing other than to get separated from your friends. And even though climbing around a sinking ship is a cool as hell setpiece, it just all narratively lands flat.

And the character you primarily play as this time around doesn't bat an eye at the amount of violence that he partakes in. And that's the point.

The last thing I want to discuss before we get into the story is pacing. I think The Last of Us is possibly still the best paced game Naughty Dog has made to this day. Just when you think you're in a certain location for a while, the game adds a new story or gameplay element to shake things up and get you to the next big beat. While the first half is slower, it's done in service to build the core relationship in a way that feels truly earned. And then the second half is non-stop throwing new wrinkles at you that make you constantly worry about how things are going to end up. This game is roughly the same length as Jack 2.

The Last of Us takes place 20 years after a societal ending pandemic caused by Cortiseps where infected people quickly display zombie-like behavior and if left long enough eventually evolve into something much worse. The story follows Joel, a long and broken survivor of this apocalypse, escorting a girl named Ellie, who was recently bitten by an infected but never turned across the country to a resistance group called the Fireflies who are hopeful Ellie's immunity holds the key to a vaccine. Along their journey, they get help from a few allies like Joel's brother Tommy as they fight their way through infected hunters and cannibals as they",

Because of the connection Joel has made with Ellie over the course of a year, he decides to kill the Fireflies to save her at the cost of humanity's future. And when Ellie comes too, he lies to her about what happened. The game ends with the iconic moment of Ellie accepting this lie. Whether she believes it or not though is for another time.

You start this game off in Boston, which is run by Fedra, the militarized remnant of the US government. then go to Pittsburgh, which is occupied by hunters who overthrew their local federal government and then turned on the Fireflies, who to them was just another group looking to govern, which is then followed by two different communes.

Joel's journey in this game has been studied, analyzed, poked, and prodded for over a decade at this point. And that's because it's so tragic and human. The loss of his daughter while society collapsed broke him. And just like his watch, he is forever stuck at the moment she died.

Anyways, I first want to talk about what Uncharted 4 could have been. Now, while Bruce and Neil were leading development on The Last of Us, Amy Henig had started work on this game. And in the initial reveal, we got hints of a pirate adventure and the voiceover of what we can only assume was the original rendition of Nathan Drake's brother teased as the villain this time around. Obviously, we never got to see this specific vision of Uncharted 4 since Amy Henig and game director Justin Richmond left Naughty Dog soon after announcing the game with Australia and Duckman taking their place.

It's got the bombastic action we know and love from the original games. Just a few ounces of that Last of Us pacing, and writing that helps layer in some great themes, character arcs, and performances, and the solid gunplay mixed with really good level and encounter design that helps make each fight more memorable.

But after The Last of Us, Naughty Dog was able to do a lot to mix in what that game did with Uncharted's gameplay, which I think really works, especially for an older Nathan Drake who might want to take the more careful approach. Each fight has a sprinkle of player creativity and amped up level design. So whether you go guns blazing, stealth your way through, or a bit of both, you get past it feeling accomplished.

And it seems like Naughty Dog felt that way, too. Because while a certain Easter egg could easily come off just as some nostalgia bait, it truly felt like the team taking a moment to say greatness from small beginnings. [Music] If Uncharted had ended here, I obviously would have been sad but understanding. But just because one thief has met his end doesn't mean the adventuring has to stop for everyone.

Granted, this game is only 6 hours, which doesn't feel like much runway to do a lot, but it's jam-packed with so many little improvements that I had completely forgotten about. Like four had a small section in Madagascar where you drove around with Sully and Sam to explore a huge open area with a few optional things to do.

Especially when you give me the mouse, a silenced pistol for the first time in the series, which makes stealth even more tantalizing.

This rightfully upsets Naen because of her clash with Sam in Uncharted 4. The two fight, break up, kill some bad guys, and then make up. After realizing that Khloe's father had actually been to this lost city as well before he was killed, they are captured by Assavv and reunited with Sam, where Kloe is forced to help Assav get the tusk.

Now, something that also makes this game particularly unique is the cultural importance of the treasure to Khloe.

Yes, Claudia Black and Laura Bailey are fantastic actors, don't get me wrong, and their performances are great here, but we really couldn't find any Indian or black voice actors who would have killed it just as much, if not more so.

I just think it was presented horribly because I'm already exhausted by the end of Ellie's journey. I don't have the emotional bandwidth to start over again in both a narrative and gameplay sense.

Growing both Ellie and Aby's arsenal and abilities at the same time throughout the game, I think would have been more compelling, especially when they finally clash and you could think, \"Oh my god, I've been building them up the entire time and now they have to fight.\" which I think would play so well if the climax was built to just once instead of being kicked off the ride halfway through and having to play another 10 hours before we get back there.

Aby's journey is Joel 2.0, know, which is some good irony that she unknowingly went on the same journey as the man who destroyed everything she knew and just happened to get lucky that her found family wasn't this super important person in the grand scheme of humanity's future. Aby's story works much better in practice because there's actual momentum in terms of a character arc.

And that makes it all feel very touristy rather than an honest experience actually being shared. That and the overly tragic end to Lev's story being that his entire family has to die just for him to be who he is is such an exhausting choice to go with. While I think it was big for such a popular team to have a trans character be a part of the main cast, I think it just ends in some harmful commentary and is more in service for Aby's story rather than Lev.

The WLF being this hypermilitarized group and the Sarapites being this religious cult who are both fighting for land and for some reason or another have never seen eye to eye.

But trying to use this macro example of a war to say that both sides are at fault, you have failed at what you have asked of your audience, to see the world outside of yourself. If a group of people are at risk from being wiped off the face of the planet because an occupying state that has power over them is causing that, do you really expect them to have as much ownership over the fallout because they dare strike back for the sake of survival?

They are depicted as these crazed zealots and their main motivation for fighting against the WLF is in the name of their dead leader and her writings.

He feels this particular interpretation cherrypicked things for that theory to work. But as far as their intent, the theory of Israel Palestine being allegorized in this game is false.
