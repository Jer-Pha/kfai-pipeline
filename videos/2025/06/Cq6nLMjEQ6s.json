Welcome to Kind of Funny Games Daily for Friday, June 20th, 2025. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside Forbes 30 under 30, aka New York Game Awards nominated aka Gas Lighter Blessing Eddie OJ. First of all, you sound crazy saying that. You must be out of your mind calling me a gas lighter. I can never. Uh, but also, yes, I brought up the song cuz I just I literally just saw your Instagram story doing like the Batman meme of like, you know, Alfred put on this gas lighter song by the chicks.

But he hasn't acquiesced to just being a hey, I'll sit in your lap and do he he'll sit in my lap, but the problem is the new studio doesn't have a great lap sitting situation for a dog. You know, the old tables, the old studio, great for portillo, but this one with the bars and stuff, like it just doesn't work for me giving him a good perch. So then I'm constantly trying to get to, hey Cole, sit in the middle of the table. Except we don't have a dog bed here, which I should buy and bring in because this is happening more and more.

Wouldn't we not just do the same thing with the dog bed? Celeste, we got to break this dog down and build him up just like the Marines do to people. Mhm. You know what I mean? Basic training and stuff. Is the dog bed going to break him down? I mean, we got we got to walk him through this process. We got We just got to train him to be like, \"Okay, hold on. Look, this is comfy.\" Cuz does the dog bed come with like walls? Is it like a dog little dog prison putting him in a kennel on the stage? No. Oh, yeah.

I had for a long time. The Dixie Chicks now the chicks. They dropped it in 20.

It was what I feared when the worst possible situation. It's the exact thing I feared when you were like, \"Oh, I'm doing the Greg Miller parade in June.\" And then like the scheduling got close to Pride and then you're like well let me dodge Pride and I thought you were going to go right into Junth for a second.

We'll start at the Embaradera. We'll start in front the front of the ferry ferry building at 10:00 a.m. We will then walk with our signs mocking Tim and celebrating me to Square Pie Guys and then just party in front of Square Pie guys till 12.

They've not released a new album since then, but before that was a 2018 looks like a live album. And then before that, 2006 was taken the long way.

Um, I'll start off with what a hefty trailer for reveal uh that showed us both a lot of cinematic, but then also a lot of gameplay stuff, which makes me not feel like this game is like far far away, right? Like I wouldn't be surprised to see this come out in like the next couple years, maybe next year or the year after. Yeah. Would that be crazy to say? No, I don't think so. I mean, this is always that problem. I would start the conversation with what is everyone's interpretation or a take on Net Ease? And I think that's the thing is that you're seeing I feel like Net Ease start to make these moves where they're not just the mobile game thing. They're just not this mobile tie.

And that's known for that's one of the other thoughts I have on it is it's so interesting and cool seeing this coming off of what Blackmth Wukong did last year. Like when you want to talk about what the AAA space is right now and how much the AAA space is growing in countries like Korea and also China when we're talking about this and talking about Blackmith and talking about other things, right? Yeah, I think this Net Ease, if I know Net Ease for anything, right, it is the mobile stuff, right? But it's also like they know how to make money. Net Ease goes where the money's at.

Blackmmith Wukong I think was great did well and all that stuff because of Chinese developer but also they used Chinese mythology to really build up this ground swell of interest and passion coming out of that audience. This being a Wooa game, right? Like I think it's going to speak to that same exact audience. And I wouldn't be surprised to see this do very similar numbers as Blackm Wukong as long as it's backed up by good gameplay and good graphics and cinematics and a story that's there which is a big ask.

That's a game that like I think really excelled w with cinematics and presentation and like the gameplay was fine, right? Um, I think if this game comes out and already we're seeing the cinematics, already we're seeing the setting. We're seeing like them lean into the Uncharted Cross Assassin's Creed style of like how good the game looks and how how high fidelity and high budget it seems. I think that's almost enough. Like I want the gameplay should be good too as well, right? But like already you're starting off on a foot where I'm like, \"Oh, that's going to sell millions and millions.\" Yeah.
