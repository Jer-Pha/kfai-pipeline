So, I'm not sure what that's all about. Getting a lot of conflicting sources. Getting a lot of people giving me info, but it seems like maybe a new patch has to go through on PS5 Pro.\n Interesting. And on the on the Pro specifically.\n Yeah.\n Oh, that's weird.\n I set that sucker to I'm on quality. I'm like, \"Oh, why does, you know, 30 frames per second, you know,\n it is what it is. Let me switch to performance.\" And it's just like, \"Ooh, blurry\n there.\" I I like existing in the in between space of like I'm definitely nowhere as about fidelity as you and Tim, but I'm definitely like higher than a Greg Miller.

Well, you know, the PS5 Pro looks it looks good, right? Like the quality still looks awesome. And the main reason I bought the sucker was for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth",

This is like not it's not even close to how bad it looked uh Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth looked on uh PS5. But you know the you see the text and it's like oof. Yeah. Why is that like that? Maybe maybe keep the UI 4K and make make the rest of the game like, you know, lower res if you need to cuz things just look a little blurriier. So, uh we'll wait for that patch and I'm sure things will,\n you know, improve.\n You going to see this game through?\n Um it's just it's a real tough time right now.\n Oh, really?

This comes from Andy Robinson at VGC. Capcom has premiered the first Resident Evil Reququum gameplay, showcasing the game's first and third person views. The game will mark a quote bold shift for the franchise, according to Capcom, and stars Grace Ashcrooft, the daughter of Resident Evil Outbreaks, Alyssa, an FBI analyst investigating a series of mysterious deaths in Raccoon City 30 years after it was bombed in the events of Resident Evil 3. According to director Koshi Nakanishi from Resident Evil 7, unlike past Resident Evil protagonists, Grace has little combat experience, which means players will watch her learn and grow as the game progresses.",
