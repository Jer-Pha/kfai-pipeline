Uh, dude, I scarfed that down real quick. Yeah, real real quick. I had another hand roll as I do. I've been on a run of hand rolls. And hand rolls, when you think about it, very similar to ice cream. Very similar to ice cream when you think because they're in like a cone shape and then like, you know, like the seaweed play paper they use to wrap it is like a cone and then like the rice and fish they have inside is like the ice cream.

So, I was making I was talking to some people about this, right, about how when Summer Gamefest first hit the scene, it was Jeff Keley making a calendar and essentially like claiming every other showcase as being part of Summer GameFest. I didn't know he was still doing that. Any new show because like the PlayStation State to play, they're not talking to Jeff and being like, \"We're part of your Summer GameFest,\" right? Or are they?

Yeah, add to calendar. Look at the little add to calendar button. So, shout out to Jeff for doing this. And even better, you know, it's only it's a it's a mutually benefiting sort of relationship. I'm sure these it's all just promotion. I'm sure these places aren't bummed that, you know, they're getting their their image sort of shown there. Cuz my question is if Kind of funny announced a game showcase for Monday, do like if we refresh this page, does it just show up without us even talking to to Jeff?

But my worries have been calmed a little bit because still looking at the way these characters look. Obviously, they're not only calm because the game looks amazing, but it still looks very Witcher. These NPCs still look like they've been kind of ripped out from the Witcher 3 game and just upresed and made to look better with lighting and everything.

Um, one of the things that I'll say about Cyberpunk 2077 as far as one of my favorite things about it is how that game looks, um, both stylistically, but then also like how the technology pulls the style together when I'm walking through Night City and I see the lights and I see the way the characters move and animate and I see like how much they have going on in that world.

I can't believe how good like how detailed and good these games, these environments, these characters look with Unreal Engine 5, Andy, like do you look at the at the footage we're seeing with The Witcher 4 and go ain't no way or is it more so just a thing of like trying to get ahead of the hype cycle?

But I know that I know of several devs and have seen other devs mention, you know, when the PS5 Pro was sort of being released, people saying people that work in the industry and that have been there for years and years and years ago, we haven't even fully unlocked what we can do with the PS5. Like, we're just kind of now getting to that point. And that does give me hope. And I also maybe I'm putting misplaced trust where it shouldn't where it doesn't deserve to be.

If everything works out perfectly, it does the to me at least, if I were to put my money on it, I would say that what we're seeing is all real and all possible because I think we're getting to that point where with enough time with development, these devs and these uh and these teams can slowly kind of unlock what the PS5 and what this generation can actually do. Mhm. And then it will only look better from there where then you talk about not only just ray trace reflections, but now we talk path tracing.

And I think that once we hopefully get whatever the next Xbox could possibly be, because this is clear that this is going to be some sort of cross generation type game. Oh yeah. I wouldn't be surprised at this situation and then and then we'll see it kind of running at where you know at its actual full potential. But I mean even right now not the best example but when you're on console and you run into a a building in Fortnite and it's using Unreal Engine 5 and it's using its Lumen system and like all of the bells and whistles that Unreal Engine kind of has right now.

So, that DLC chat, correct me, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe was PS5 exclusive, whereas like the actual game was PS4, PS5.

So and like even the mus the horse muscle system, which I'm sure translates to humans as well, right? Oh, definitely. Yeah. Like when you talk about those things and like the things that maybe an animator might not have to think about as much when it's okay, cool, I can make my horse run or I can make my humans move a bit more naturally because the systems already exist in the game to like have their muscles move in certain ways. cool, now I can focus more on this other aspect and like these games are going to look better",

And it all gets it all comes down to time. And whenever we look at devs with little time making games on hardware that's maybe underpowered, you think of how the the constant um comparisons between something like Tears of the Kingdom compared to Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Yeah. And one game is a game that's clearly a game that was rushed as hell.

They kind of reduce them down to voxels and then show how they kind of then expand out to full foliage. So damn impressive. But yeah, I think a lot of this comes down to time and those lessons learned with Cyberpunk. Yeah. And how the behind-the-scenes footage on or or behind the scenes murmurings from people at on the dev team going when they said that we were releasing the game on this time, we all just laughed and we were like, \"Yeah, [\u00a0__\u00a0] right, dude.

And one of those positives comes from the CD Project Red sort of actual writeup article on their website which is just announcing what they were going to show here today. But we get a quote from joint CEO of CD Project Red, uh, Michael Noacowski, who says, \"We started our partnership with Epic Games to push open world game technology forward.

Like coming off of having their own engine and having experience with like open worlds and wanting to make worlds that are demanding of what they are, you want an engine that can meet that demand. And so, yeah, having the Witcher 4 be the one to kind of lead this charge. It I keep bringing up Desimma, but it's just the it's the easy example to give, right, of like that's a collaboration between two developers, right?

Yeah, Breath of the Wild was going to be the reference I made also as far as like how physics interact for you to to get these unique and interesting situations.

I guess my thing is I think if we're talking about Metacritic wise like I think Witcher 4 probably has like the highest I I think Witcher 4 would be the one I would bet on even though we are coming off of Cyber Punk but Cyberpunk got there in the end as far as being a really incredible game.
