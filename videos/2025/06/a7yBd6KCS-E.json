I was going to say at first starts, okay, Splatoon spin-off, whatever. But I think as we get deeper and deeper in here, it gets more and more interesting. Well, I mean, even I don't know about that. Splatoon spin-off, I do think is is interesting because I think it's the right move for them. I think Splatoon is obviously a gigantic brand from Nintendo that we have already known.

This is like was going to be one of those things, but it's actually a bit bigger. I love that because Greg, that's a little bit more evidence for Smash Brothers or Animal Crossing type. where I was at. That's where I was getting excited.

Note, the Nintendo Switch was very supply constrained at launch. Nintendo Switch One did over 80,000 units at launch and Nintendo 3DS managed 113,000 units according to Nintendo. Neielson IQ does not share full sales figures, but it doesn't come close to being the biggest UK console of console launch of all time.

So I wonder when we are going to start getting official Nintendo talking about this of like hey let's you know pound our chest and talk about the big numbers. Um clearly it's selling very well and clearly it's stocked very well which I think is the the bigger point.

To be clear, I'm not expecting 100 million this year by any stretch of the imagination, but I definitely expect that by end of life, right?
