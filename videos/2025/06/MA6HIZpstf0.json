I'm one of your hosts brain July 11th month until Superman. Everybody get excited, get hype. Of course, I'm one of your show hosts. I'm Mike. Welcoming you into today's games cast with three incredible human beings on the panel. Of course, remote tuning in my main man, Paris Lily. Paris, how are you, Mike? We got to talk. Paris, we got to talk. We got to talk about a lot of things, you know. You know, I'm I'm in Los Angeles. I'm at the Xbox fan community watch party watching the Xbox showcase, having a good time with the community. What a great showcase it was. It it was some people say and then I get I get word through the grapevine. Yeah, Mike didn't like the showcase. He gave it a five out of 10. And I said, \"What? How could he give it a five out of 10?\" My fellow Excast brother, by the way, so",

Bring it back.\" I want to say that. Do you remind them that the games castes every day? They should watch that. Paris. Yeah. And then I explain that and they go, \"Well, yeah, I understand why you did it. It makes a lot of sense.\" But still, we we love the X guy. You know what it is? They miss Gary. It's not even me. They miss Gary and all of his rances, right? And Paris, I miss you. I miss talking Xbox with you. I, you know, got to talk Xbox with blessing Tim and Andy after the show and I was like, man, I need Paris here. We need to talk about Xbox, the future, what I was expecting.

I was expecting a little bit more even though I set my expectations lower. I did think that it should have been a little bit higher on that one. So Paris, you and I do need to have a little breakdown. So if we have some time at the end of the show, we got to talk about that. What would you have scored it? What would you have scored it Paris? All right. I I I cheekily said 9.5 because I said that last year, right? And I saw social media explode into anger. But an eight. I thought it was an eight out of 10. It was solid. Yeah. But let Mike. Yeah. Legit. If we got time later, let's let's jump into it right now. Tell them why why you want to break these Xbox people's hearts. Paris. This is why the show can't come back.

And uh as I was walking to the JW with Phil Spencer, look at me. Look at me Lou. No, but uh you know, he asked me what I thought and I go, like I said, I thought it was solid. I go, it would be impossible to live up to last year because that's kind of one of those once in a decade kind of things, if not the best show that they've ever done. But I think they gave you a solid stream of games and announcements, things coming in 2025 that I want to play. October is just a monster for Xbox with all the stuff that they're putting out then, right? Obviously the handheld showing that off and kind of showing the future of where they're going with Windows and all those improvements",

The fact that you can't live up to last year and you know next year it's a 25th anniversary and Phil said at the very end you're getting Fable, you're getting Forza, you're getting Gears Eday and without saying it, we're going to see whatever the future of Halo is as a part of that celebration. Of course, they're not going to show all these things this year because they're going to save them to 2020 2026 and show them off during the 25th anniversary. So, I thought when you think of showcases of the past and just again, you can't live up to last year. This was this was a good one. Like I said, there's games I want to play that came out of this. Paris is 100% right. Paris is 100% right. In the chat, Melof Fellow is 100% wrong. I'm a round mic. 6.5 or seven. That is two",

Please bring up the review. You said both. Let's just let's draw a line in the sand and be a man having a because of course on the review scale I am exploring the words. I know the numbers stand out. You hear the five to six. You go, \"Oh my god, that means it's awful. Mediocre to okay.\" And I think this year personally was an okay year for them. I think the past two years, two summers, they've had very strong showings. This summer was on the weaker side. I think it started out the gate very weak. As I said before, the opening to this Xbox game showcase was not a strong opening. Outer Worlds did not show up very well until the end of the show where we got to deep",

Outer Worlds did not show up very well until the end of the show where we got to deep dive into it. And it's understandable that you kind of keep that for the back half. And then you roll into High on Life, uh, a new plagues Tale that didn't really pop like the recent Plagues Tales one and two. Then you go into the Rods Ally into Dawn Walker. That first five sections when we were here in the Kind of funny studio, no one popped until Super Meat Boy at six came out and it was like, \"Oh, I'm kind of excited now.\" And it just felt like this isn't the Xbox we've seen the past two years. And I touched on that of like I think Xbox the past two years has got really excited Paris of like we got to make a name for ourselves. We got to show you we got the games because people have been running around saying Xbox doesn't have games and they've gone out the past two years and really showed",

And I think what happened here was this year they were like oh man we showed so many games that we can't show them again this year because we need to save them for next year and beyond. And so I just feel like this year was like here's the catchup moment of we can't be amazing to great nine and eight every year there's going to be one year that's going to catch up to us and this was that. So let me jump off of that please. Another thing that I think was very important and I said this multiple times to people at Xbox when I talked to him after with this new strategy of they're putting games on multiple platforms. This is an Xbox marketing. I now truly understand what it is and the branding that they put on every game. They told you every platform it was going to show up on if it was",

They told you every platform it was going to show up on if it was Play Anywhere and if it was Game Pass. I think that was very important because there's no confusion. You knew exactly where High on Life 2 was going to be, right? It was going to be on Xbox, PC, Cloud, all that stuff and part of Game Pass. Going to your point about the opening of the show, first of all, Don Walker's heat for me. So, I was very excited to see Dawn Walker. The the handheld again, the the Xbox Ally X, I think is a big deal for them because it symbolizes the future of where Xbox is going. So, that's I I got excitement out of that cuz I'm like, okay, we're clearly pushing more into a a wind a world of Windows where we're optimizing it and we're making it more of a console experience. And we got Greg obviously talked about it already. We got hands-on with it. I I I think it's",

We got hands-on with it. I I I think it's solid. I think it's something I want to get. As soon as I saw Greg at the thing, it was the first thing I said to him. I was like, \"Oh, you're going to be really happy when you see that Alli X, you know, hands on.\" So, well, I think I get your point, Mike, but this is where I think you're coming off of last year into this year, and of course, it's not going to live up to that, but I think for just a standard game showcase, there were a ton of games like Clockwork Revolution, that had to have excited you to see that. I remember we talked about it. We said Clockwork Revolution showed up and they showed a big pair. They had a a great showcase. The issue is is it felt like they went above and beyond to the point where that is a show the date afterwards kind of trailer because now they're going",

We got all these games and like sure it might drop next year but like that trailer in particular was so good it should have had a date afterwards. That's the kind of level of good it was. So I I will to your exact point, this is why you show Clockwork Revolution now because you're not showing it next year and it would get lost in the weeds of Fable and Gears and Halo and everything else they're going to show. Now something that I will critique them for is no Ever Wild. I'm to the point I give up because what is that game? You give up on 2019. We still have no idea what it is and here we are in 2025 and you're still not showing whatever it's been rebooted into. And again, to this point,",

And again, to this point, you're not showing it next year because no one's going to pay attention to it because of all the other big games that are coming out. I was also surprised we didn't get State of the K3 this year, but maybe that's next year. I I don't know. We'll see. I Yeah, you showed it last year. I didn't think we'd see that this year as well. But look, I just think they did a a solid job. I I didn't think this was poor. I didn't think like, man. Oh, we Silk Song. They obviously pretty much confirmed we're getting Silk Song this year, so I smartly drafted it in the fantasy draft, by the way. Yes, you did. Yes, you did. Yes, I did. You really need Well, like I said, oh my god, no Fable, so I'm screwed. But anyways, I think they did a solid job. Like I said, an eight. I would realistically give it an eight.",

I would realistically give it an eight. Um because I don't think unless you are putting those other big hitters in there, I saw enough there that I was excited for things to play. I mean, dude, we're getting a double find game this year. We're getting a solid October. Like you said, you have Keeper from Double Find, Ninja Gaiden 4 and Outer Worlds 2. Somewhere in there, you will probably get a Call of Duty end of October into November. Call of Duty is a big deal. There's a double-edged sword with this Call of Duty trailer, right? There is like Andy so wisely pointed out, there's a cool factor to this new Call of Duty and what they're doing with the campaigns where that trailer was good. The issue was it is not close the show out good after the hype up of 25 years. If that was in the middle of the show, we would have spoke about",

Hey, we have a pretty cool campaign. We have a pretty cool theme going on with Black Ops that like you, the main audience out there that might like poo poo Call of Duty, you should try this, right? But to end the show and like it's Call of Duty, it should go buck wild over the top to have that kind of tone setter trailer and nothing else afterwards as well just left a bad taste of like, oh, this one like didn't hit at the end there. I personally think they should have flipped Black Ops 7 and Clockwork. Yes, 100%. Put Black Ops 7 in the middle and then have Clockwork at the end.

It's that long and then no date ready when it's going to be ready. Like what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Not this year. Yeah, I thought they should have started off the show with Call of Duty. We saw an amazing looking Soulslike from the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Pokemon devs Game Freak. That game looks amazing. Um, followed up by a random sort of like, hey, Grounded 2 is also coming out. Wo, that's kind of a big surprise. Mudang Two Hearts looked freaking wild and weird. This crazy looking who knows what sort of genre it's going to be. Uh, playing out from all these different characters perspectives. Um, at Fate's End looked freaking fantastic. I I I really loved the showcase even though my kid had told me temporary expectations.",

I really enjoyed this.\" I like that. And Paris, to jump off of that, like there's a couple more things I want to hit up. You talk about the Xbox Play Anywhere, and I think you and I have been so deep into Xbox that I already assume and I'm already on the Xbox Play Anywhere. I'm glad that, you know, Greg and the public can now kind of snap in and see that like they're really pushing that for, but since 2015 and beyond, they've been pushing the when you buy this, it is going everywhere that we can. And so I've already I'm not wowed by that, Greg is what I'm getting out of now. So many third parties though, Mike. So many third parties now.

And so it's been tough of like people are putting that up on the pedestal and it's like well I've already had that up on the pedestal. I've already expected that. So it's not a big hit for me. And on the third party partnership side we've had years now where we teamed up with Riot right and got all of the League of Legends champions, all of the Valerance. This year we didn't have that big third party, oh wow, they're partnering with this, right? The biggest announcement was, hey, we finally got Final Fantasy to come over to Xbox. And it's like, yes, we've wanted Final Fantasy 7 for the past eight years or whatever that year count is. Thank you for finally making this happen. And so, I thought there would",

Why is that not here? The bestselling game foot bestselling sports game of last year in all time is not at one of these major conferences just driving some hype with the band that should have been here. Does that take you to a 7.5 NCAA? I'm just saying it's like those are the big wins that you remind people of of like, hey, this was the bestselling game. EA Play and Xbox Game Pass gives you 10 free hours of this. Let's remind you that you can get this, right? Hey, Ubisoft, we've teamed up with you before to put on certain Assassin's Creeds.

Two things before we obviously get off Xbox and get into the meat of the show. Going back to what you're talking about with Play Anywhere. Yeah, I've I've obviously been a big fan of that for a very long time. Um, and to see them now, that's why I was talking about having that branded and making that a big part of the show that you're now there's now starting to get thirdparty partners on board with it as well. So, you buy the game once, you play it across multiple devices. And this is again where I think the handheld really kind of is the shining light on that that wow, here's this Xbox handheld that I'm now going to be able to play games on that.

There's still confusion about what games are playable on that handheld through Play Anywhere, where people are going, \"Well, this is really isn't an Xbox. It's it's a PC handheld. It's running Windows.\" So, essentially, anything they've labeled Play Anywhere, anything that's on Game Pass, anything that is playable on a PC, you can play on this handheld. your old Xbox One 360 games that aren't already a part of Play Anywhere or Game Pass, you're not going to be able to play them on on there.

We got so into that co-op that they literally had to walk over and go, \"You do realize this isn't a preview event. You got to leave.\" Because it was that good. It was that good playing it, right? All all the upgraded visuals and everything that they had on that. Like we're jokingly saying that if Gears of War came out today, what we played, everyone would be singing its praises as a huge game.

It's going to be huge for those two franchises to get a massive player base underneath them and really explode like they should. I think Halo Infinite on PlayStation, if we rewind time, that would have really helped that player base stay alive a lot longer than it did. But uh Paris, my two standouts were Double Fine Keeper and Grounded Too. I had a great time. I know a lot of people get a little worried about the score of a five to six.

Of course, everybody's been waiting for it. We got the big announcement. We saw the teaser trailer. Now we're ready. Paris, what did it look like? Tell us all about it. Oh, to be clear, no hands-on. It was a theater presentation of what I saw for for Resident Evil 9. And shout out to Britt, who unfortunately could not be at Summer Game Fest.

You're because, you know, the main character that that you're showing up here on on the trailer right now, you're playing, they're playing as her and I think you even see that in the trailer where she's tied to a table and and can't move and then it's her slowly being able to get out of that and the struggle and just you're like, \"Oh my god, what's about to happen?\" And then when she finally gets out it going through these corridors or rooms and then you got this big monster that comes out of nowhere and is chasing her and the heavy breathing and you're like, \"Oh my god, is it going to get her?\" And at one point it does get her and it bites her and everyone in the crowd's like, \"Oh shit.\"",

It was a very intense demo that they had graphically, visually look really really good. The sound effects, you know, just set up the environment, the tone of everything that was going on and they're really, really good. Um, yeah, if I can honestly one of the things you're talking about, Matt Kim over at IGN wrote about I thought was impressive. Of course, you're playing as Grace Ashcrooft as we saw in this trailer.

Uh, combined with Grace's palpable fear, running away from this mysterious new monster feels even more terrifying and reminds me almost like the first time I played Amnesia: The Dark Descent. No thank you. Yeah, it is definitely one of those no thank you moments that what they showed it's in the game really intense in the gameplay that you watched Paris, were there any switches between the first and third person perspective?

You're running from the creature, you're running from the monster, and be from the ground up a brand new experience. Yeah, that's interesting because for me the past two with seven and eight, right, have been like these big set moments that like are the scariest part of the game and then kind of like we come down off of that and they're never the same as the dollhouse or that opening sequence in the mansion down in seven.

Yeah, I don't know what that could possibly mean. It just it kind of looks like a Resident Evil sequel, you know? Yeah, 100%. That was my thing about it where it's like I I was talking about it earlier. I didn't take this demo at SGF because of I only had the one day there and I wanted to see as much as possible and I'm happy I didn't. It feels like, you know, Paris's preview sounds so much like everybody else is like, \"Yeah, there's dark hallways. We got a lighter this thing. It's crazy. It's scary.

Why is this big giant monster lady trying to eat me kind of thing. So, it was I I liked it. I really dug it.

But it was fun to jump around, explore, you know, you've seen it grab onto the elevator thing and shoot yourself up. Like there was something I was like, \"Oh, this is fun.\" Dead space vibes cuz that's when I looked at it yet. Yeah. Exactly.

For Paris and for Greg, did Were there any Did you all see any variety with the hacking? Because I know I I think of Near Automa where Near Automa their version of hacking when you know you sort of like get sucked into a terminal and before a boss fight it kind of looks like a Space Invaders game or or or an asteroids game or whatever and that's their version of that. Was it all this grid based stuff? So, the grid is the grid, but what like everything that Greg already talked about is the appeal of of this hacking mechanic because first and foremost, that 20-minute demo that that was cruel of them because right at the freaking end, you're like, \"Oh, hell yeah.

But you can see that grid getting very complex because what'll happen is you're getting because you know you you she she has to take down their armor and shields. There's various power up things that you can get in that grid as well, you know, to like like like uh Greg already said to do more damage, to take down their shields more quickly, take down armor, like upgrade your weapon, stuff like that. And you could see it getting way more complex on that grid because you have to hurry up and do it because if you don't, they're coming at you. They're going to take you out if if you don't hack them out. So, no, the grid isn't different. It's it's always that same big square grid, at",

But the like Greg said, right now, you would probably say, \"Hey, this is an eight, right?\" But there is room for improvement of this, for challenge of not only the hacking side of it, but obviously the shooting mechanics as well to where you could really see this ramp up. Um, there was decent enemy variety of the robots and the things that you saw like Greg Greg already mentioned, you you see the boss at the end, but you don't actually fight them. So, I'm curious what other kind of boss characters and mini bosses that you'll you'll see going through the space station. But, I mean, I was impressed. I was very impressed.

Yeah, cuz that's where I'm hung up on it a little bit where it's like, you know, my last bullet point here that I wrote when I was playing was the shooting feels so slow with the gun, your regular gun.

So, it probably in the last 18 months, we were we've now had Rise of the Ronin, we got Assassin's Creed Shadows, we're about to get Ghost of Yoai, and then this is targeted for, I believe, early 2026. I wonder and what cuz again, not hands-on. So, the premise of it is, you know, you're you're battling all these characters with your sword. You're doing all the pairing and the moves, and you're you're grabbing their souls, and as you get the souls, you can upgrade your character and power up, and you know, you become more powerful.

Obviously that's not fair to it every to each their own. But I only want to do sword pairing in these kind of games so many times, right? So obviously we'll see by the time Ghost comes out and then this will come out a few months after that. But from what they showed in the demo, it looks like a lot of fun.

Just they they just showed us during the theater. Did they show off any boss fight u interactions? Matter of fact, if if you scroll back, there was the one character we saw his arm starting to turn purple. He was one of the many bosses that that you got to encounter in there. And his fight looked pretty good. Um, just the different parrying and the moves that that you would have to do going him right there. You you fight him in the demo. It was good. It was good.

Obviously, it's going to be coming in understanding the moves of the sword play, knowing how to parry, you know, all all these things.

I thought the combat was fine, which is that's the main part of the video game, but everything else was like super stunning. Yeah, it all comes down to how flashy some of these moves can be, how cool I can feel as the as the sword wielder, cuz that's ultimately what what the game is.
