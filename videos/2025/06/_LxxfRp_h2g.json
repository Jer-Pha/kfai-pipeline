For now, let's start with the topic of the show. It's handheld gaming in 2025. Couple questions I posed to myself, Greg, like to try to like give context to the conversation here and what we're even talking about cuz what is handheld gaming in 2025? I feel like back in the day it made a lot more sense. It was just, oh, it's a Game Boy, that's it. You know, but that was a long time ago. Since then, portable gaming, handheld gaming has taken many different forms. So, why would you want a handheld gaming device? The categories I came up with were modern PC gaming, modern console gaming, retro emulator gaming, modern retro emulator gaming. that I'm I'm counting like",

The categories I came up with were modern PC gaming, modern console gaming, retro emulator gaming, modern retro emulator gaming. that I'm I'm counting like PlayStation 3, Wii U, you know, where it's like it's retro, but it's not old school Super Nintendo and all that stuff, right? Like it it's stuff that hurts us to call retro, but it is. Uh and then game streaming. So whether it's cloud streaming or remote play or or things like that. Am I missing anything there? Those seem to be the big reasons you'd want a handheld gaming. I know this is going to get an eye roll, but I think it's worth of the conversation. We are missing mobile gaming. We are missing an iPhone and iPad. I do think that there are still a lot of people are playing a lot of games there. Whether they be I'm doing Resident Evil on my iPhone or I'm playing whatever the new Cookie Clicker is on app based gaming then. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Fair. So key factors to consider within that",

So key factors to consider within that are compatible game collection/stofronts. So for example, Nintendo Switch, you're locked to Nintendo Switch games and that's it. Whereas most of the devices, whether it's uh more portable emulation devices or things like the Ally or the Steam Deck, you have choices of different um stores, different operating systems to allow you to get into them, different workarounds. But that's the whole conversation there. Uh then it's is this for travel or is it for a second screen experience? Meaning, is this something that you want to be portable? Cuz just cuz it's handheld doesn't mean portable necessarily. or is this something that you want a second screen on your couch while watching TV or while someone else watches TV or whatever? Then uh the quality of the screen. You know, there's a lot of",

You know, there's a lot of different screen tech these days, whether it is OLED displays or aiming for higher uh refresh rates. Um and uh there's different reasons to want uh one or the other of those things. Uh then portability overall in terms of if it's going to be a portable device, how portable is it? because yes, the Steam Deck's portable, but it's a lot less portable than this guy, the Trim UI brick. Uh, and then price, of course, is another major factor to keep in mind with uh all these things. And I think the last one is versatility. Like, are these devices able to be good enough at other categories, even if they're not the best, and there is a better device for X, Y, or Z, but this one's good enough at all of them that it's an easy recommendation to if you just want one thing, go with this, you know?

Sure. So with all that, any opening statements about the state of handheld gaming in 2025? Paris Lily, I think Microsoft with Windows has an opportunity to really dominate that market for everything that you were just talking about. Windows is the dominant operating system. Windows allows you to have anti-che, so you can play games like Fortnite and Call of Duty. Windows allows you to have multiple storefronts, whether it be Xbox, Steam, GOG, Epic, Ubisoft on on down the line. Obviously, what we got to see uh last week is them trying to iterate and and have a a true Windows handheld experience that's easy to use. Press the power button, you're into your games. You're able to play them, have the multiple stores. We talked about the emulation piece of this. Obviously, Windows is very friendly with that as",

Obviously, Windows is very friendly with that as well. They're not there yet. I'm going be crystal clear on that. There is still work that they need to do to get there. I think right now clearly Nintendo with the Switch 2 kind of dominates the handheld market. We're seeing the sales numbers out there. I say behind them what Valve has done with Steam OS, but Linux, you know, has its limitations, which is why I think Windows does have an opportunity if they can kind of shore up some of those sore points that they have right now. But I'm excited for the future of handheld gaming because I do think there is a market there. I think every everything that you listed out about it, the fact that I can play my AAA PC games on the go when I'm traveling, I can cloud stream them at high quality as I'm sitting on my couch, you know, through through my",

Things like that excite me for the future of where handheld gaming is going. Um, we're almost there, I think, but there's still work to be done. Mike, I actually don't know about you and handheld gaming at all. Like, what are your thoughts on it in general and let alone 2025? Yeah, I'm more the person on the fence about handheld gaming here, probably on this panel. Uh, I feel like I am surviving an onslaught of everybody having a handheld gaming device now or announcing a new one that I should go purchase. I am just overwhelmed on the Tik Tok shop of all these different emulators that are trying to get sold for 70 to 100 plus dollars. And so for me, handheld gaming has kind of come really fast on these past couple of years where before it was clear, this is the Game",

I get that, right? I think the Nintendo Switch really nailed the handheld for me after of course the PSP and VA which I loved and enjoyed but the Switch nailed what a handheld to me in this new generation should be right it is a atome console and then it can be picked up and on the- go for that versatility and that portability and so for me now I look at my Switch it's like okay well they nailed that like that is where I go to but I am someone who plays in a lot of different ecosystems and I kind of want my games to come with me and I've always had a dream of X, Y, and Z, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, Steam, all coming with me somewhere, right?

We've moved past that, right? As an Xbox fan, we've come hard off of the Xbox Series S. And I know for me and Paris will tell you not many games were really held back by that. But there was way too many news stories of the Xbox Series S is holding it all back. They can't make games for this. Oh, this game's not releasing there. And so I worry about handhelds being the same way of like if I invest this now, this game won't run on it or this game runs so poorly on it, it's not worth it.

What are your thoughts on handheld gaming in 2025? What a time to be alive. Uh you know, I think we're very lucky and me in particular since I'm a little bit older than most people. Well, not older than Paris. Come on, no one's that old. Uh but the idea that you know I've talked at length about the fact that all the nerds uh like me grew up and kind of took over the world in some very bad ways but in some great ways right in the way of like all these superhero movies we get and all this cool [\u00a0__\u00a0] and how popular video games are and da da da.

But the fact that handheld gaming is where it is in 2025 is so special to me as someone who's always loved handheld gaming, right? Game Boy was my first Nintendo anything. I was a a Sega kid and then I had to beg mom for that. She said, \"There's no way I'll ever spend $100 on a video game console.\" And then Antel bought it for me. Um, and then, you know, from there it was into Game Gear, and it's been on every other stretches you go to PSP, DS, 3DS, etc. You wouldn't have to go through all this, right? But especially when I came to IGN in 2007 and you'd sit there and review all these different versions of games and really find usually and I'm talking about like you know crossplatform tie when they're trying to do like a tie-in or a thing or a wrestling game or a sports game find the handheld version to be",

We can't afford to take chances. Handheld gaming as we knew it in 2007 could never exist like it does now. And rather than it go away, it really opened up to, hey, gamers want to be able to play their games everywhere. You know, I I joke around obviously all the time about the VA and the PSP and you know, they I just Blue I BSed Blue Sky uh Tim uh that you know, VA crawled so that all of these handhelds could run.

But for real, like hats off to Nintendo. Thank you so much Nintendo for with the Switch One going like we are going to make this thing. It's the one Nintendo system. There isn't a handheld and a console anymore. It's just one. And the fact that people ran to that for as underpowered as it was and were like, I want this and that PC manufacturers took notice, PlayStation took notice, Xbox took notice. So now we are, hey, let's solve these problems so you can get a good enough experience in a handheld form factor that you can somehow complement your other devices. Like I am so thrilled right now where we're at, let alone where we're going to be in 6 months, a year, two years, 5 years, 10 years when suddenly like this isn't even a conversation anymore. or it's just all ubiquitous and it's, you know,",

I don't know. Tim, I'm right there with you. I mean, we are living in such a great time in terms of portable gaming devices, handheld gaming devices on the PC and console side. Like, I feel like because of how handheld devices are. They're they're kind of a area in tech that cares about the tech of it, I think, more than most because it has to have the hardware to be able to run the games, but also a screen to be able to display them, but also a controller to be able to to have the inputs, right? So the combined [Music] me a lot of thinking about just controllers and like all right there wasn't a D-pad until there was there wasn't an analog stick until there was and then there becomes these kind of like standards that are set of we need shoulder buttons",

So, they have to be homogenized to a certain level. So, because of that, I think we're at a great uh spot now with uh looking at even the devices at the desk where there's more similarities than differences. And I think that overall we're in a great place that no matter what your needs are, you'll at least get a good enough version if you're willing to spend the money. Uh and I think all of that is only going to get better and better over the next couple years. But I think that we are firmly in a present where it's here. This is happening. And it's not a, oh man, this is going to be so",

And uh, I really do think that we're at the point with handheld gaming that we were with the I'll say iPhone 10 when it for finally went full screen, right? And it's just like ever since then, it's like cool, the phone tech's being upgraded, but at the end of the day, the iPhone X is all you need. you know, and sure, an iPhone X in 2025 is maybe unacceptable, but like in terms of what it needs to do, it has all those functions. And I only use iPhone cuz I've only had iPhones, but Android as well, whatever the equivalent when it went full screen.

Uh, my point being, I feel like we're already at that point. the we're at the the convergence points the smartphones hit a decade ago now because we're freaking crazy old. Um, but I think handle held devices on the small side are perfection and on the higherend side, I think with the help of cloud streaming are essentially at perfection. But without that, we're just a couple years away from being in in a perfection place. Having said that, the moment we get there, the hardware for consoles and PC is going to be higher anyway. So, we're always going to be chasing that high to some extent. 100%. Yeah.

Um, I I just prefer through the hardware and obviously the user interface that Steam OS has.

I mean, clearly from the Nintendo games that I'll be able to play on that. I do have um, and I never get these names right, but I have the the Rogue Ally, the original one. Yeah. Um, I actually dual boot that with with Steam OS and Windows right now just to go back and forth. It is my least use because of the user interface of Windows. I'm just not a fan of it currently.

PS3 and that sometimes hit or miss or whatever, but if you dial things in, you can get it going. But in addition to all that, it streams great. Like this could be a PlayStation Portal replacement. Um, most devices can be as well. So, um, I absolutely love this thing. What is that using to play remote play? Is it doing the Chiki like on Steam or Chi for Deck? Uh, similar things.

Yeah, you the the top level I would say is there are many players in this game whether it's the the Legion Go and its iterations, the the the Raj Allies, the Steam Deck, like there are definitely many players in the game, but I would say after the experience that I've had with all of them, it really kind of comes down to two leading ones currently. And that is the high-end, which is the ROG Ally X coming in at $900. um or the Steam Deck OLED that comes in at $550 or $650. But the note there is I would recommend the cheaper one. Oh yeah.

But the other difference is the um more expensive one has an anti-glare screen. And this does come down to preference. But me and the majority of people that I know prefer the cheaper one because the anti-glare um lessens the brightness of the OLED screen. So I think it's a better screen experience with the cheaper one actually. So that's that's good to know. U but then the one to keep your eye on is the Xbox Ally X. We don't have pricing information on that. We are going to expect that the the higher quality one, which is the one I would go for, is going to be about 900 800 if we're lucky.

Uh, but it seemed like the perfect device for me because it was, hey, it's just this Steam OS interface. You're not getting into Windows unless you want to go do that. You can just use this as a VA game machine, whatever. And I did and I had my Steam Deck and I enjoyed it quite a bit. But the problem I found with it was that it just was Steam.

Da da. And as I would complain about this, so many people were like, \"Greg, what you're describing is the ROG ally X or ROG ally, right?\" Uh, and so I looked into that and had I had hit them up years ago actually about getting me and Bless review units for just the original Ally when it launched. Uh but as lo and behold as all this started they hit me back up were like hey sorry we missed this we would be down we'll send you and uh bless Alli X's and so when I jumped into LAX I had heard so many people have the problem of ah it's it can do more and it can",

I'll stick with Steam.\" And it's been the exact opposite where for me with the Alli X, like the touch controls on it, I feel are better in terms of a mouse movement and double click. I guess it's more natural than I feel my Steam Deck's touchscreen ever was.

Um, having said that, it's undeniable that the ROG Alli X is more powerful and can run games better than the Steam Deck. The problem is at this point the Steam Deck is more optimized and it like the Steam system it uses is more optimized to play games.

I don't think they're going to leave the old games behind.

One downside is it is obviously exclusive to PlayStation's ecosystem. Like you can only play PS5 backwards compatible cloud games or whatever on it. So you are locked there.

Uh, PC streaming, Steam streaming, but the biggest thing is GeForce Now. If you are interested in GeForce Now, it is I mean I cannot recommend the product enough. Um especially on the high end.

And this is the thing that Paris and I got when we went and and saw this behind closed doors, right, of them talk, you know, they were talking about the silicon chip, right, of like this is being we're trying to future proof with what we have so that we can use AI upscaling, whatever the heck the tech is that go on that'll hopefully make this device, the Ally X able to hang in there longer than the others, but who knows?

I think it's going to be a long time. There's concessions made. So, ASUS actually, cuz they had another stream, too, where they they talked about obviously the partnership with Xbox, and they specifically talked about why they didn't go with OLED, and it came down to a couple things. VRR price. That's why they didn't do it. It would have astron not astronomically, but it would have greatly raised the price of the device if they tried to do OLED out of the gate.

BJ Bernardo says, \"In the future, will handhelds be the low bar of entry like Xbox Series S for the next gen? oral handhelds be the only nextg console. I I think that we're already kind of at a point that it it's kind of just options. I I don't think necessarily, especially on the Xbox side, that it's going to matter much next gen. I think that it's just what is the version and entry point of the Xbox experience you're getting. The PlayStation side is very interesting where like I'm still not convinced they're ever going to have another dedicated handheld.

I don't even know that they need it necessarily. Like I think that they they're serving the audience that they have and I think PlayStation function differently where I don't have faith in them being able to get their games running on a handheld device in the same way. Um, but maybe I'm wrong there, but I I think it's the same thing is that um a lot of these and what Steam Deck probably thought at launch too, just of like we've already sold all the PlayStation fives and PlayStation 5 Pros we're going to sell to Greg and people who are like Greg.

You know, I feel like that's the idea of like it's another way to sell a $300, $400 device to someone who would give you the money for it. Let's set our expectations reasonably. Let's let's have it for PlayStation. I'm sure they say, \"Let's have it be another success like PlayStation VR was and like Portal was,\" which were two devices that PlayStation was openly like, \"Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] these sold this sold a lot better than we thought it was going to sell.

Does it ever come to market? Yeah, there too. And I I just again I I feel like we'll get something we'll get a follow-up to the Portal that'll have more features undeniably. I just don't see a future in which PlayStation I mean I don't see a imminent future in which like next gen there's going to be a PS6. Like I guess that's my thing. The PS6 is not going to be a handheld device. Uh Kyle says, \"Great assault here.

Big games remote playing off PS5 Series X, so the SD doesn't get hot and battery lasts forever.\" Yeah, I will say the best overall device in my opinion is the Steam Deck OLED just because it checks the most boxes. The one problem there is ease of use of getting to your Xbox games, but you still can do it. There's still ways around it. Yeah.

Question for you, Tim, or the panel, I guess. Does anybody have experience with these docs? I mentioned uh they mentioned in the presentation for the Alli X and then I talked about it as a talking point like the ROG XG Mobile dock that boosts things.

You already have that on your TV. If you didn't have an Xbox Series X, depending on price, I'd look into that. But if you your your use case is playing Xbox games on this thing, well, I feel like your Xbox is going to be better than it. Fair enough. Um, and then yeah, in terms of uh Steam, other downsides of the Steam Deck, I don't absolutely love the button placement um on a lot of things. It's a lot wider than I want it to be. um that just has a whole units and uh it brand new games are not going to run perfectly on or not going to run on it in most cases, but uh it's not it's not just oh man, every game that comes out you can play on this unless you're down with cloud in which case that is the case.

Uh we have Street Shadow saying, \"When have uh we've seen what everyone else is doing, but with strong rumors of Sony dipping into the space, what do you want them to do in the space? Competitive pricing and seamless console to handheld experience.\" I mean, yeah, that's the dream, but I don't think that's a reality at all. I personally, as a PlayStation gamer, like I'm happy with the Portal 100%. Give me OLED. Like, that's really OLED and Bluetooth support and the Portal is essentially perfect. Yeah.
