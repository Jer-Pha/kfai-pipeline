Uh I've put hundreds of hours into Mario Kart 8 over the years. I have, as we've talked about on other pieces of content, 29,000 uh coins that I've collected throughout uh races uh throughout the years. I have three stars on every Grand Prix in 150cc, mirror mode, and 200cc. And this is my first time booting up and actually playing Mario Kart World. I picked up my Switch 2 last night. If you watched our launch party stream last night, I was purposely uh not joining uh the fun because Mario Kart means a lot to me and I I wanted this to kind of be a a personal kind of uh intimate moment with myself and the first new Mario Kart in over a decade. Uh and so here here I am. I've I've downloaded a bunch of games last night. I was up until 2 a.m. uh downloading a bunch of stuff. Uh you might be wondering why Persona 5 Royal. I was just kind of curious uh",

I was just kind of curious uh because I know uh some games, especially Persona 5 Royal, look a little fuzzy on the Switch one. So, I was just curious like of a game that doesn't look, you know, the best on Switch One, not getting any upgrades on Switch 2, what's that difference there? Stuff like that. Uh and just other games I'm uh interested in in in playing uh soon. Got Delta Rune. I'm very excited for. But it's time for Mario Kart World. Um, I'm excited. I'm I've feel like I have forgotten a lot of the things that I've I've watched. Obviously, there's like systems and new things that uh have stuck with me, but as far as like courses go, I don't feel like outside of the Donkey Kong one uh that looks really really cool.

I'm very tired because yeah, I stayed up until two in the morning downloading a bunch of games and getting excited for this. And oh, look at that map. Now, I'm I'm interested to see uh what the open world is like. I don't think I'll do that on this let's play uh here. Um Oh, hold on. Yeah. Yeah. Let's let me let me take this in. There's that boy. There's that little Italian man. Mario Kart [Music] World. This is a great tune. It was one of those I love the Mario Kart 8 soundtrack a lot. I love the main theme for Mario Kart 8, but this is just this is an energy. This is a vibe. This feels like a new era truly. Uh this new uh Mario Kart World theme song. Oh, you waved to the cow.

Uh this song, if that makes any sense. But let's get in here. God damn. Uh, and so I think what I want to do, we got single player. What I want to do, cuz I'm, you know, I'm I I love the Grand Prix. That's, you know, what we've always played Mario Kart 4, right? Uh, but we've got the open world, we've got Knockout Tour, all this stuff. I think for the first half of this Let's Play cuz I I think we're going to go roughly an hour.

Uh again, this is uh this is all new to me, so I'm going in here uh fully unknowing. So, we've got our roster. We got a lot of people going uh on here. Uh got a lot of unlocks that we have. God damn. God damn. Um yeah, some some like I already see Waluigi. I see another Donkey Kong here. Yeah, I'm interested to see how like the costume system and character system works. And so here's the tough thing, ladies, gentlemen, NBs. I had a man for 150cc and his name was Link, last name unknown. But in this game, only the core Mario characters essentially are in here.

Uh, that always felt good to me on 150 C. And so I was starting to think, all right, well, on 200cc, the mode that I played on the most, my my main was actually someone different, cuz Link to me felt like he was a little bit too fast for me for 200cc to be able to actually uh get around some of uh some of the crazier turns in the game. And so I went with my boy Shy Guy. And I just learned last night on stream that we don't have the color variants for Shy Guy because in Mario Kart 8, my main was black Shy Guy because his color represented the color of my soul. I also wear a lot of black and so that like he he felt like a a little a little homie and his black",

Um smart steering we're going to turn off and then yeah all this other stuff I think is fine. Dash food transforms doesn't transform. Oh, interesting. You can just like uh do the dash food just to collect and not necessarily transform mid mid race. That's neat. Um all right, we have smart steering off. Now we have to look at our carts here, which we don't have a lot of. My instinct is to go with a motorcycle, honestly. Um, I like the basic cart with Shy Guy, but again, 200cc because I think that those are fair speeds to recognize what you need to do for 200cc. So, I think I kind of want to go with a uh with a motorcycle here cuz yeah, that uh I mean, a lot of the the speed on that motorcycle isn't great.",

I don't even want to like look through the rest of them. Like again, I'm I I truly feel like I don't um haven't really taken in all of the tracks here. So, like I just want to just jump in here. Here we go. My first time playing Mario Kart World and seeing how it truly feels. Can't tell if this is just like a pre-rendered video because it doesn't look great. Looks a little pixy and and soft.

I I definitely get what Tim's saying here with these like wider tracks. It definitely feels like uh a bit slower there, like even at 150. But that's proven. You know, just because it's slower doesn't mean I'm going to be great at it right away. So, there's still a lot to learn here. Oh, you got that boost off of me. [\u00a0__\u00a0] Donkey Kong.

Oh, we're collecting more coins more than 10. Interesting. I wonder what we can go up to. And does that actually affect the speed? Who knows? Still yet to be determined.
