Little Friday the 13th vibes for you. I'm Tim Getty's. I'm joined today by blessing Addy Jr. Good day, Tim. Snowike mic. Motion control king. Remember that. I'll never forget it, Mike.

We've been playing it a little over a week at this point and we are ready to score it on the kind of funny scale and give our final reviews. Um, I want to start with Barrett Courtney. Oh gosh. Before I get there, actually, uh, this one release date June 5th, Metacritic at 87, the first Mario Kart in in quite a while. But Barrett, what would you give Mario Kart World?

Um I believe I put in a little over 30 hours after a week. I have 245 earned stickers cuz that's kind of your only way to like kind of collect stats uh throughout this game. Um I have 24 P blocks, 12 peach coins, 13 question blocks, and I've three starred everything that is available to threear, including spoilers mirror mode. Um, after all of that, after a week, I would on the kind of funny scale give Mario Kart World an eight. I think it's a great game. Uh, I think it's a solid like start for this, and I'm excited for the potential future of this game, but I think in the first week, um, a lot of there's been a lot of like weird things that I've noticed, uh, in Mario's Mario Kart's like first foray into the open world stuff that I think holds it back right now.

I'm interested to see how if and how Nintendo kind of uh supports that and maybe adapts that over time. Um I think the highs are incredibly high. I think the highs match the highs of Mario Kart 8 in terms of uh the theme park feeling. To me, Mario Kart is at its best when you feel like you're constantly driving throughout a theme park. And you know, Rainbow Road, um the the Boo Theater, all that stuff. Like so many courses just give you this sense of like wonder and enjoyment. But with the open world stuff, um, kind of the biggest thing to me is that so much time is spent not in those moments, uh, because of this inclusion of the open world. I said it to Mike yesterday, but it's like so much of this time feels like I'm not in the theme park, but I'm in the parking lot outside of the theme park going from course to course. uh going like uh",

And so I think there there's like kind of an imbalance of kind of taking everything in and being in awe of what a Mario Kart uh can be. Uh, but again, the the highs are still in incredibly high. I think the lows are just a bit lower that bring it back for me.

I don't think it's uh mind-blowing or anything and again I'm I'm excited to see how Nintendo supports this uh going forward. Snowike mic. I like that.

Tim, this is the first time in a long time where I've grabbed a Mario Kart, and I am actively excited to play it because I am wowed by some of the new ideas when they bring up the open world, the knockout tour. I really, really like that. I haven't felt this much fun playing a Mario Kart since Mario Kart 64, right? Which was like my first time jumping in. Every time since then, it's like, oh, it's more Mario Kart. Like, that's cool. I enjoy this. I jump out of it.

And I think a lot of that is driven by the knockout mode, which I think is a really cool, fun, different way to kind of break up the, hey, we're on the track, we're doing three to five laps, right? It's like I like as Barrett so well put I do agree with you bear when you look at the maps that are not three laps and they're kind of broken up into three to five stages. It is I'm on a highway. Oh, I'm out in the forest. I don't get to see Peach's Castle like I want to. But I also enjoy not doing the same three laps over and over again. I really do enjoy the vibe of oh I'm also like I'm almost like Forts Horizon with the open world where I'm just driving from one point to the other and it it feels fresh. It feels new and maybe that's why I'm riding this high off of that. But I really have enjoyed my time doing",

And the music, holy cow, Tim Gettys, let's stop put a pin on that music. That music are we talking uh soundtrack of the year? I mean, it's cheating a little bit. I'm just saying about that. It's real good. I love every single time that there's a new track played. I love hearing tracks that I love that they've remastered, that they've remixed. I think the music carries a lot of this, which is awesome. I think the characters are great.

Get the whole Get the ARMS character in there. Like it is odd. It feels so right kind of sticking to just Mario, but when we talk of Nintendo and kind of like the Smash Bros. feeling of it all, it is odd that we don't have that.

And I'm happy to report that they've gotten very close. They're not there yet, Tim. But man, that multiplayer experience is so much better than what it has been, right? The idea that you can jump into a room of Grand Prix, of knockout, of battle, right? Or you can host lobbies with your friends as easy of here's the friend code, everybody jumps in, right?

For me, there's a adage when we're talking about video game reviews that I believe I heard originally from Tamore where he said that you have to review what's there. You can't review what the game isn't. you have to review what the game is. And that's kind of where I come in with Mario Kart World where I think the best and worst thing about this game is the open world. Um, when you play knockout, the knockout mode, that's that's maybe the best addition you could ever make to a Mario Kart game. That is so fun. It is so intense. I think the whittling down from 24 to 20 to like you know until you get to that top four and you're going for the winner there that is such a genius thing and that is only available because of this open world format and how",

And I realized that for me it's not necessarily that the tracks aren't, it's that you're spending so much of the Grand Prix in those in between spaces.

Yeah. Um mirror mode. Yeah. So, mirror mode, which has been around I I believe since the Gamecube days, um maybe before that, did you look into it? Uh, I can look up N64, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't on the N64. Mirror mode is essentially just 150 CC but backwards.

It was one of the like especially when DLC tracks started being added to Mario Kart 8 DLC and the the way Mario Kart 3 starring works is that if you get three stars in 150 that counts as three stars for everything 150 and below. It doesn't count for mirror mode and it doesn't count for 200 CC. You have to do those separately. So doing all the courses again at 150 CC but like flipped is just like not interesting and it's uh kind of filler for filler sakes.
