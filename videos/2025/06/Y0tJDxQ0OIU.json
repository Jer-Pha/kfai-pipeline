We are going to see more of The Witcher 4 tomorrow and hi-fi Russia's studio is hiring for a new action game. We'll have all this and more because this is kind of funny games daily. [Music] What's up everybody? Welcome to kind of funny games daily for Monday, June 2nd, 2025, Nintendo Switch 2 launch week, summer gamefest week. Oh, what a week. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside Forbes 30 under 30, aka New York Game Awards nominated aka Perry Poppy. Blessing Addy Oay Jr., I have to acknowledge the fact that you're still using this coffee cup that you got from the Nintendo store. That's correct. And I looked inside it expecting to see regular coffee and I'm surprised to see that you have ice cubes in this thing. You're drinking ice coffee out of a regular coffee mug.

Obviously, I like the roost. I like Animal Crossing. You know that.\" Um, and that I was going to have it be my coffee cup. But then it's just getting hotter now. You know what I mean? It's summer time and so I like a good iced coffee, especially I did 20 minutes, 21 technically in the car today for Gregway. And so I got it parched and so I want the liquids in me quicker. So I need I cool it down. So yeah, I've been putting the iced coffee in there. I'll be putting the I'm not used to seeing Yeah. ice cubes in a coffee cup. I hear you again.

So I was like when I put them on Instagram story I'm like you saved me one and it sat in the shop for weeks until I actually made it there. But I got there and now I have a Pedro Pascal cup. How you doing? How's your weekend? Uh I am excellent. My weekend was good. It was a good family weekend. Nice. All right. You know what I mean? So we went to the beach. took Benny out for ice cream. He woke up from his nap. We were there. We got home. I made him watch the Superman trailer again. And then I gave him all the Superman toys I had bought and been hiding.

We got bonkers coverage and plans over here. It's time to get serious. It's E3 week. It feels like that. It does, which has me very excited. Um, what I did over the weekend was play a bunch of games. Kind of like trying to dive into my backlog. It's funny cuz I went this weekend I played um, Hollow Night. I actually started that on my trip on my Steam Deck to my trip to LA last week. And I think I haven't seen you in a while. You've been off there doing even you went to LA. You did all stuff. You I haven't done been on shows.

And so yeah, I've been uh playing Hollow Knight. I started playing HalfLife over the weekend. I also played the demo for Dispatch when I was I want to hear about that. Yeah. Yeah. I saw of course you you've made your return to streaming. I see you over there on twitch.tv/blessing junior. Yeah. I'm trying to like stream a bit more consistently. So as an excuse essentially to like dive into my backlog cuz we've had this top 100 game things that the thing that we've been preparing for. And funny enough, we've already submitted our list now. Um, but for some reason after submitting the list, I was like, \"All right, now I'm going to play the games that I was actually gonna [\u00a0__\u00a0] try and play for this list.\" And so, yeah,",

Um, but yes, during the weekend I picked up Dispatch and I played the demo. Have you gotten to check out the demo yet? No, I have not. Yeah, that dropped uh late last week into this weekend. I know. And so I'm already sold on it. I saw you come to the realization that it's a management thing. Like that's the whole hook, right? Is like Aaron Paul's the character you're playing as. He can't be a hero. So, he's behind the desk dispatching uh the heroes to go out and do things. Yeah. And I don't know how It's funny. I rewatched the trailer after I played the demo. And I played the demo a second time. I played this demo twice because the first time in playing it, I start the demo and I'm in the cut scenes and I'm like watching the story play out and I'm like,",

I'm I want to just watch this this show or this game as like a Netflix show or as an Amazon show the way I do Invincible.\" Yeah. Um, the choices feel very tale and I like the writing. I like the characters. Like this world has personality to it. And then they threw me into this management sim where it is all right. You have eight heroes that are essentially like suicide suicide squad style. Like you know they're criminals but they're now enlisted as heroes but they're also kind of bad people but like you know they're trying to make a do a good thing, right?

Can you send somebody that can get a balloon out of a tree and then also somebody that's not going to scare children or you'll get a different thing that's like all right there's a bank that's being robbed. can you send somebody that can deal with maybe that that might have stealth for a hostage situation or might have like the strength to deal with like you know robbers or whatever it is and you're looking at your roster of heroes and having to figure out like all right who's right to send all right this person is now resting because I just sent them on another",

I thought it was gonna be straight up just a tail game. Make choices. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um and like the management stuff is in there in the trailer, but I think I just thought it was going to be miniame type stuff and it seems like this is actually a good portion of what you're doing during the game. And I was very surprised. I came out of that out of the first demo playthrough cuz it's like a 30-minute demo. It's not that long. Came out of the first one being like, \"Oh, that was different than what I thought this game was. I don't know.\"",

I don't know if it's deck compatible. Do you I mean did it How much mouse movement is there? Um I believe you can play with a controller, but I mean it it seems like one of those games that'll be easier with a mouse. Obviously we're not going to do that, you know. No, you should check it out. Oh yeah, 100%. No. Dispatch is high on my list of anticipated stuff for this year. Yeah, for sure.

I think that's the that was the motto from yet last week for me of like, all right, there's just way too much happening here. And then for people to come out and say, \"Fantasy life eyes your kind of game, Greg.\" We watched the trailer like I don't know about that. Can you give me like what your 21 minute Gregway is in like two words? This game, this game has so many [\u00a0__\u00a0] systems layered on top of each other.

It's been in presentations. And then last week, somebody was like, \"Greg, you you like Animal Crossing, but this is way better than Animal Crossing. There's more to it.\" And then we watched this trailer and I said, \"This looks like a game that's doing a bunch of stuff and not getting any of it 100% right. It looks like a jack of all trades, masters of none, right? If you're an audio listener going for it. Yeah. Master 14 unique lives. These are jobs you can have as you run around.

Like everything else has been not at all build a town, do this thing. I'm shocked cuz we're watching the trailer and I'm shocked by how much combat I'm seeing. There's a lot of combat. Yeah, if you want there to be. There's a lot of tree stuff in there. So, I'm very I I am enjoying my time with it. I'm excited for more. Uh I talked a little bit just tip of the sword um on uh uh Friday's show with Steen Tatillo about it, right? That I think one of the things I I think that it's awesome they're getting right uh because this is a level five game, right? Available right now on PC uh Switch One,",

But what I think is really interesting about it is that they are crossplatform save. So, oh, when I get I think what's going to give it even more legs for me is that Thursday get the Switch 2 and want to try as much new stuff as we can on it, but how many new games are there to actually try out, right? And the fact that I can download this and then kick my save over from PC and see how it runs in Switch 2 and do all that I'm pretty stoked for. Oh, yeah. So, you're into it? I am. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's that thing of, you know, when I kind of talk [\u00a0__\u00a0] about it when we watched this the trailer last time around, somebody BSed me and they were like, \"Hey, like I hear you, but I'm 20 hours in and",

They keep adding more things that I should be doing or not doing. And it's like I don't know at what point we're find because like they pitch it as like, \"Oh, it's a cozy slow life sim RPG.\" So, like they're pitching it like Animal Crossing. So, eventually I know the training wheels are going to fall away and be like, \"All right, what do you want to do? Would you just want to cook food and sell it? Or do you want to go fight these monsters?

That no open world RPG has been made in Unreal Engine 5 yet. So, I guess that's why you'd want to be behind and do it, let alone The Witcher name. Awesome. I'm excited to see more.
