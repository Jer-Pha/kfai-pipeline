On the latest episode of the last Nintendast of the Nintend dogs, uh, Giant Bombs, Jeff Grub shares that he's heard the latest God of War titles now due to come out in 2026.

Um I do think that we get a big exciting game in the same way that Ghost of Yote is going to be for this year.

Nintendo 64 did not win, did not even uh compete necessarily in that console generation against PlayStation because it didn't have the third party games. You go on forward to the uh Gamecube, same story. PS or uh you know the Wii even more so. They got the support, but it was for like a very different type of game. Wii U even worse, blah blah blah. The Switch is underpowered, so we're getting cloud versions. all this we get to the Switch 2 and it's the first time we actually have a level of parody of good enough it can actually play the games.

But I think on the third party side, there should have been more advising from them as far as like, yo, this [\u00a0__\u00a0] is backwards compatible. Don't put Yakuza Zero as a new version on launch at Switch 2. It doesn't make sense cuz people are going to pick up the Switch 2 and what do people play on on Nintendo consoles?

I wonder if they're going to be full-on cart or not. Like I doubt it for Square Elden Ring. I could see them pushing to do it. Yeah. I I wonder what's going to come from that. I also do wonder how much that matters. How much can fit on these carts nowadays?

Like, like we're right now in this moment of launch where all the little details matter way more than they're going to later. Because I think all that affects really is like physical versus digital as far as like where that percentage comes in. So, so that I think is the important thing for us to keep in mind going forward here is right now we have what three and a half million Switch Twos out there at the very least. It's probably closer to 5 million at this point. Maybe 4 million. I I don't know. But like we're getting up there, but it's still not like insane. You got to",

Like I think that's going to be hit. Third parties that have uh a inkling that their games are going to sell incredibly well. Why would you why would you Yeah. Like no, wait till there's more switches out there to sell these games to, you know? I think that makes perfect sense. And I think that those are going to start doing uh very very well. But then there's also two factors to keep in mind that we'll just have to see if it remains true going forward. Nintendo sells more physical games than PlayStation or Xbox does.
