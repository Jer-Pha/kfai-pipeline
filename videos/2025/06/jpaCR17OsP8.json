And so I went to change it and then I uh they added all these like old consoles as your icons for this one too. And I was excited about that cuz they had my the Game Boy Pocket that I first had. I was like, I'm going to make that. So I did. And then my Mi was just gone. My Mi was gone forever. I couldn't find him. And I was like, wait, there's no trace of this beautiful face anymore.

I don't think that it necessarily makes for the most exciting console launch of all time, but I do think that it it might end up being the most strategically wellplaced console launch of all time of the the timing of this coming out now, people being excited, wanting to play it, it launching with the Mario Kart.

The answer is both. Uh, Grace is pretty powerless from the get- go. She's only able to pick up makeshift weapons like glass bottles to use as projectiles. The narrow hallways are sometimes bathed in blinking red emergency lights or no lights at all, while some doors only lead to pure darkness. At some point, Grace finds a lighter that helps her navigate these previously unlit areas. I did bullet point parts of Matt's preview.

Eventually, Grace will encounter a horrifying new monster that kind of reminds me of the creature from the 2022 horror film Barbarian. Uh, this monster will stalk Grace through the dark corridors, much in the same way Mr. X or Lady Deatrice did. Combined with Grace's palpable fear, running away from this mysterious new monster feels even more terrifying and reminds me almost of the first time I played Amnesia: The Dark Descent. However, this fear I described is mostly present if you play the game in first person perspective. And as Capcom revealed during the preview, you can switch perspectives at any time.

In third person, running away from the monster felt a little more tactical than survival horror. Though, given Grace's limited arsenal, it was no less stressful. Gamespot's Kurt Indones Indovvena says, \"While it induced controller gripping stress, it all felt very familiar to me. a d\u00e9ja vu effect bringing me back to Resident Evil villages house of Ben & Viento.

But as a gameplay reveal, this brief hands-on left me neither surprised nor underwhelmed, but rather unfased.
