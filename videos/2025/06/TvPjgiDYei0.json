We'll have all that and more on today's kind of funny games daily. [Music] Good morning gamers and welcome to Kind of funny games daily for Monday June 16th 2025. I'm one of your show hosts Snow Bike Mike and today I am joined by one of my gaming dads. Happy Father's Day to one of the coolest dudes around Mr. Paris Lily. Paris, how are you big dog doing? Good. Thank you. Look, happy Father's Day to you. I saw I saw what Sarah Bond sent you. Still one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen and I love that they're keeping it going. So freaking good. Yes. Uh thank you to Sarah Bond and team Xbox for year two of celebrating Snowike Mike's Father's Day. Uh you know fun. I truly appreciate the card. I now have two Sarah Bond postcards that I have framed in my gaming studio. So I'm very lucky for that. But Paris, of course, happy",

Dad wouldn't cut the yard first thing in the morning. Yes. Yes. But then, you know, kids got up, they gave me some wonderful gifts, and I have to barbecue. You know, my my wife made breakfast, the whole thing, but I have to barbecue. So, I smoked some ribs and I actually made a video I was going to post uh trolling Khalif and I was like, you know what? It's Father's Day. No violence today. I I'll put it out at a later date. It was no violence. It was good. Oh, that's great to hear. Paris, any gaming over the weekend?

So, I want to shout this game out because um I I was lucky enough to go over to Poland for the preview event for it uh some weeks back. I now doing my second playthrough of The Altters. Um I played it on Steam. Now I jumped on Xbox. I'm playing it on Xbox. It's one of the best games of this year, man. It's really, really good. And and the basic premise of it is, let me let's do the combination here. It's a survival game. It's it's a base builder. It's resource management, and it's a story about different versions of yourself. That's what the altars are, right? And there's potentially 11 different versions of yourself that'll be in this game. But the twist is it's different life choices at different points in your life. If if that makes sense. It's like a certain point in your life",

It's like a certain point in your life you instead of me meeting my wife, what would happen if I didn't, right? What would happen if I went to college instead of me going to trade school? Just simple stuff like that. But these changes completely create a different version of yourself. And you're stranded on this planet. And the whole reason you have to create these altars is you're by yourself. You're you're you're uh Yan. and you have to create these different versions of yourself to help you get off of this planet before you essentially you die. And the story is phenomenal. There's not like all these big enemies you're fighting or anything. It's like I said, it's the survival aspect, the base building aspects of it, and then it's the story of you dealing with different versions of yourself and them being self-aware that they",

And again, I don't want to spoil too much of it. I'm just telling everybody right now, you want to play this game. It is that good. 11bit has to be one of my favorite publishers out there from Frost Punk to obviously here playing the altars right now. Moonlighter 2, which is coming pretty soon. I'll have more to talk about that, you know, down the road. But they've quickly become one of my favorite publishers out there because I love the uniqueness of their game. So, if you're looking for something different to play in 2025, go check out the Altars. Which, by the way, Mike, it was you and I were doing the partner preview 2 years ago when they first debuted this that they saw our reaction to that, which is why they wanted me to come out and preview the game and obviously",

We'll talk some Xbox throughout the show, but yeah, currently sitting on the PC Metacritic at 84. Got a lot of positive reviews, Paris, and to hear you gush about it. I'm very excited. I want to make time this week to try to play it because yeah, it it it seems so cool. It was fascinating. Pairs, all the clones and what that meant. I love the survival games, you know, that the base building. So, I'm excited to see how it all kind of meshes together to make a really fun game. Oh, no. Absolutely.

The fact that one person did this, I'm telling you, when you play it, because every version of Yan, you would think it's a different voice actor for all different versions of it. That's how good he is doing this. So again, just kudos to him. I've been lucky enough to get to know him over the past year or so. Awesome dude. I I got to even sit down, interview him during the preview event, talk about the game. Really great guy and just uber talented as a voice actor.

Wednesday, June 18th, 6 a.m. if you want to watch it live or with us at 10:00 a.m. you will get a Donkey Kong Bonanza direct presentation.

I'm a huge Donkey Kong fan, but playing it I I guess it's just not what I wanted from Donkey Kong. I I don't know any better way to say it. So hopefully I see something new in this direct that gets me back on board, but unfortunately yeah, I'm I'm just I'm just mid with with my hype level for it.

It's not Mario anymore. I want something new in my life. And that's what I'm hoping for. So for me, I I bought the Switch 2 for this. I am very hyped for this game. 15 minutes of Donkey Kong going a little more in depth since I didn't get to go to the big Switch 2 presentation with Roger Bless and Tim where I know they went hands-on with the game before.

Why did this not grab you? Is it not that 3D action platformer collectathon like I'm envisioning a Mario Odyssey but Donkey Kong? That's obviously that's what they're trying to do with this. And you're doing the essentially the destructible environments on it. And again, I I'm taking a very small sample size at at a preview event, so don't get me wrong, but I didn't feel like I I it was kind of directionless when I got to the main area of of where you were in in the preview. I was like, \"Okay, I smash a bunch of stuff. All right, what do I do next? Yeah, sure. I collect this. What's this for?\" I I didn't necessarily like all the traversal in it. It didn't feel as intuitive as I wanted it to",

It didn't feel as intuitive as I wanted it to be with the destructible ways that you can go through the environment. Again, small sample size. It's just that was my first impression of it. So, that's why I'm hopeful to see more here at this Direct. I'm like, \"Oh, okay. I see where they're going with this. Okay, I'm I'm I'm back on board wanting to play it.\" But when I compare it to previous Donkey Kong games, and obviously I guess the Mario Odyssey team made this, Mario Odyssey grabbed me immediately, right, playing that whereas this one did not. So, I'm hopeful, you know, I see more there that gets me back on board cuz again, Donkey Kong is one of my favorite characters ever. Okay.

I want to see more how the destructible environments with DK adds to the actual gameplay elements with this kind of being an open zone world. Is it essentially I can go do whatever I want whenever I want? Is it that I have to go a certain path with this? Is there secrets and things that I'm going to discover by being destructible go, you know, digging into the environment, right? Are there some mini bosses? Obviously bosses and the characters.

Nintendo Switch 2 set a new all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware in the US with over 1.1 million units sold during the week ending June 7th 2025 excluding sales from the my Nintendo store. The record was previously held by PlayStation 4. Little clap right there. Congratulations Paris. the hype, the big sales for us to be expected. I think so. I think Switch 2, regardless of the price increases, was highly anticipated. So, it was not a shock at all that it set records and Nintendo clearly did a great job of making sure that anybody that wanted to get a Switch to was able to get a Switch, too, you know, within the first week. So, you know, kudos to them. Look, as as bad as I talked about Donkey Kong a second ago, I mean, I love my Switch, too. Um, I I I think it's great. Um, been",

It's a great It's a great piece of hardware and Nintendo's Nintendo. They're always going to make great games. So, of course, the hype was was going to be there. And like I said, regardless of it being 450 and really 500 with the Mario Kart bundle at launch, people showed up and they went out and bought it. Yeah, they showed up, Paris. And it felt like there was more or a better easily available option to purchase it. I know it was always Mayhem night one, but it did feel like more people bought it than more people saying, \"Ah, I didn't get it. It sold out. This was whack. I didn't get a hold of it.\" And it also felt like my GameStop when we went to it, right, had 102 units",

And so, yeah, it felt kind of like the right storm here, Paris, on availability. I think of course Switch One heading into Switch 2 had that perfect storm of people know what the console is. They know what the, you know, the idea and the vision is from Nintendo and how this dual handheld/home console was going to be and yeah, it just feels right for me and I'm excited to see over its lifespan. Paris, we talk about the Switch One selling so well. I assume I predict that the Switch 2 is going to do the exact same, if not better, because it feels like they're really on the path of nailing what they want to do with this console. Yeah, completely agree. Let's go to part two on this one. 79% of US Nintendo Switch",

We know historically Mario Kart has always been one of the the best sellers for Nintendo with a high attach rate to their hardware. So, of course, and making it, bundling it in, I'm I'm like I would be very curious to know what the split was between the bundle and the people that went and just bought it standalone because I would imagine God it probably is what 60 40 maybe even 7030 people just bought the bundle. I mean, why wouldn't you? And again, it was readily available. It was not hard to be able to get. You could walk into a store day one and go grab that bundle.

I bought the Nintendo Switch 2. I plugged it in. What was the first thing I did? Went to the Nintendo eShop, paid $80 for Mario Kart World. You knew it was going to happen. There was a cycle of things that was just going to happen. And so, yeah, I'm one of those people. And also, I have a hard time imagining everybody didn't do that. 79% is very high.

The top three bestselling Switch 2 physical video games sold in the week were Mario Kart World, Cyberpunk 2077, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. Cyberpunk 2077 getting a whole lot of third party love on this Switch too, Paris. So, I have to tell this story really quick. I kind of chronicled it a little bit on the social media as was happening. So, you know, in in my day job, I had been traveling like for the couple weeks coming up to Summer GameFest and the launch of the Switch 2.

So, I I'm not surprised to see the sales numbers for that. And not to mention, it's almost like a um it it shows off the the the technical the performance prowess of the Switch, too, because obviously we know Cyberpunk, you know, is, you know, a showcase game on PC to show off the visuals and everything. I mean, and it's it's cyberpunk, man. I mean, it it looks pretty darn good and it plays pretty darn well on the Switch, too. I was pleasantly surprised.

Paris, very exciting stuff. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, uh, number three on the physical selling list. Paris, did you jump into the upgraded versions of those at all?

After more than a year of near total absence, aside from a rogue Echoes of Wisdom listing, Amazon has finally resumed direct sales of Nintendo published Switch games in the US. The move breaks a longunning freeze out that saw Amazon skip all sold and shipped by Amazon listings for Switch 2 titles, ignore pre-orders entirely, and leave everything to third-party sellers. Until now, only third-party Switch 2 titles like Sonic X Shadow Generations were available to pre or were order directly from Amazon. First party launch games such as Mario Kart World and the Switch 2 editions of Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom were",

So, what about the console in general? Nintendo Switch consoles are currently sold out at every major retailer. While launch day stock was solid, helping the console shift over 3.5 million units in just 4 days worldwide, it's been tough to come by ever since. Previously, the Amazon listing for the Switch 2 plus Mario Kart World bundle was cluttered with questionable third-party sellers.

The tech demo captured on PlayStation 5 and running at 60 frames per second follows Siri as she explores the neverbeforeseen region of Kovir in the midst of a monster contract. There is an incredible amount of detail in the tech demo with fluid animations on a level we have yet to see on current generation of consoles.

Let's just get a really good version of it on the Series S. But I was a little surprised to see that they are still targeting current consoles.
