And to me, that doesn't really get the hype up too much. I'm just like, okay, we're going to see some cool [\u00a0__\u00a0] Similar to State of Play.

Kelly first voiced Peach in the 2007 Wii game Mario Strikers Charged uh and which is amazing and has continued to provide the character's voice in the years since, including 2024's Princess Peach Showtime. Writing on Instagram on Friday, Kelly said that Nintendo informed her this week of its decision to recast the roles of Peach and Toad, who she had also voiced for many years.

When when she confirms that she's been replaced, I just imagine like the voice you're hearing is not me. That's not me. It's a clone. There's a different person out there.

And I do feel like that is a trend that we've seen recently. Uh whether it's I mean we'll see with the Persona stuff, but like with Persona 3 remake, Barra is bringing up like yeah, they were able to give a new generation um an opportunity to be a new generation of players versions of these characters. It is a little bit more weird with these Mario characters based on how little they actually talk.
