I'm one of your hosts blessing add Jr. Joining me is Lacroy Poppy Tim M [\u00a0__\u00a0] yetis. Oh what a pleasure to be here today. We got some fun stuff to talk about some Xbox and PlayStation everything in between. Everything in between Nintendo. Is that the thing? Is there some Nintendo? I don't know. I don't think there's anything Nintendo said. Nintendo's been having so many goddamn things recently. So it's nice. It's like take a seat Nintendo. We're going to talk about Fortnite instead. Yeah.

You're really playing it that much. It's all day. Oh, I've been on it so much. Mario Kart? Uh, I've dumping around. I mean, I've we'll do a whole uh what we've been playing episode of Games Cast after this, so I don't want to spoil too much, but uh I've been playing a little Pikmin one. Oh. A game that like I've never fully given a shot. So, I'm like, Nintendo's treating this like one of their their big five. So, I'm like, I I got to show it a little bit. One of their big five.

You know what I mean? Like I feel like that's a different conversation. Well, I mean, well, I guess am I putting Metroid in the big five? That's Here we go. Wes, listen, it's a slow news day, so we can have this conversation. The conversation for me is I need to show more respect to Pikmin and to Animal Crossing. Well, Animal Crossing for sure.

This is Franchesco Deo at WCCF Tech. I got a super chat question for y'all. How much are you willing to pay for the Xbox Ally? Let me know in the super chats. The ROG Xbox Ally is launching in a few months, but Microsoft reportedly has yet to commit to a price due to the uncertainty of the current economic situation. In a new report shared today, Windows Central corroborated the rumored October launch window for the two handhelds, clarifying they are tenatively slated for late October. According to the outlet's sources, however, the rumored prices of $4.99 for the base model and $799 for the premium model may not be accurate as Microsoft has",

Tim, what you think about that? There's a lot going on here. I will say I don't believe these numbers. uh the $800 for the premium model. That's the same price currently of the the uh Asus Ally X. Um and I feel the same way about this as I did Switch. And I was wrong. I bet $400 on Switch. It ended up being $450. So I'm looking at this now. This is being even more powerful. Part of me is like, \"Oh, the Xbox branding and partnerships going to make them want to try to get on the low end to maybe subsidize here or there.\" The realistic part of me is like, \"No, this thing's $900.\" Yeah, I think it's 900.

I mean, again, I I feel like that's the type of stuff that like you can't really at all predict or anything. I'm just saying more just like industry trends of where we're at with this level of tech. Um I would not be surprised with them offering two models of it. Um I would not be surprised if it was $900. Um I eight or nine. Honestly, if it ends up being eight, it's not like the biggest shocker in the world. I will be literally shocked if it's anything lower than that though.

I don't think it's going to hit that. But we need to realize that like take tariffs out of it and take like the entire conversation. Of course, we want everything as cheap as possible. These are expensive products. Like there's just no getting around it. Like you were paying for tech. This is the equivalent of like buying a PC and like yes, you could buy the cheaper PC, but this is the high-end version of the thing. like this is them trying to give a high-end model of uh gaming handheld PC.

But you got to pay for that. Like you compare that price even to the highest steam deck which is right now is at 650. And I was saying I don't recommend buying that. I recommend buying the 550 OLED one because the only advantage you get are an extra terabyte of storage that you could just buy SD card for and an anti-glare screen that I prefer the cheaper screen anyways. So really comparing the Steam Deck at 550 then you start going up at the high-end model to the high-end model of this. This thing is demonstrabably more powerful than the Steam Deck. Yeah.

Like I don't like for how many handhelds there are out there currently and for how much the price is going for, right?
