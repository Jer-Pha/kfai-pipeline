Then I'm going to respawn here and you're going to meet me here. I'm on my way. So essentially the right way to do this though is you would fight backwards if the people have respawned and meet me at the doorway. All right. I think I'm at the doorway now.

He said it would take him about 10 hours if he was uh on the move to play. And so make sure to give him some love. Uh he'll probably hopefully be back tomorrow. But he had a great job on Friday. As many of you know, he put out the big time I played every Naughty Dog game. Let's discuss. And you guys should go watch that because I thought it was really really good.
