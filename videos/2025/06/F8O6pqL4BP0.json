That meeting was essentially like a a debriefing of him sitting me down and showing me unreleased death earning footage. It was really me just asking him questions about the game and what and about the scene where the song would live in the game and and he was asking me about how I work. And I think at that stage it was like mid November and I was like, \"So, what's the timeline on this?\" and he was like, \"Well, end of the year.\" So, I was like, \"All right, we got 5 weeks to write, record, mix, and master.\" But we got it sent over and it was shockingly fluid. I think between us, I between everyone here, uh, I think the the Death Stranding music was already locked when I joined when I joined on. And I think he got inspired when I sent him the sort of demo version of that song and said, \"You know what? We can always squeeze someone",
