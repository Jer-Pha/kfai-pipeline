We'll have all this and more because this is kind of funny games [Music] daily. What's up everybody? Welcome to Kind of Funny Games Daily for Wednesday, June 4th, 2025. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside Forbes 30 under 30, aka New York Game Awards nominated, aka Dontober Fiend. Blessing, Eddie Yoay, Junior. I woke up this morning and I was ready to come into this episode being very gloomy, being very upset and sad cuz I saw online other people like Jordan Midler already had their Nintendo Switch twos. Sure. And I was like I was going to come in I was going to be really like, \"Oh man, what's going on here? I can't believe I don't have I don't believe I can't believe we don't have ours yet.\" Yeah.

Uh yeah, ladies, gentlemen, NBS, you may have heard that of course Nintendo Switch 2 weren't going out for review ahead of time. That was a well-known factoid out there. We had been told by Nintendo at some point in the launch window. We would get units from them, a couple of them. We we have two, one to me and one to Tim. Uh that we would then be able to use. We didn't know when that would be. We didn't expect it right now because of course uh we are going to the Nintendo store tonight. Uh we are streaming from the Nintendo store tonight for the actual worldwide launch and stuff. So, a lot of interesting things happening. But we do in fact, if you are an audio listener, have the Nintendo Switch 2 regular, no Mario Kart, Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, Nintendo Switch 2 camera, and the Joy-Con 2 wheel set of twos.

There's so much happening at once, right? What an embarrassment of riches. And so, I'm so excited to be part of this and have the excitement. And then, of course, today they're like, \"All right, well, what do we do with the rest of the day?\" Cuz there's no embargo now. We have it. We can go like, \"We're going to we're going to open it up. We're going to look at it. We're I've never touched the Nintendo Switch 2. We're going to get online.

We are going to do that big uh skip the state of play. You're going to do the best that's PlayStation play the Switch. We were going to do our kind of funny uh launch party for the Nintendo Switch 2 all night into games daily, but I feel like that's changed now, right? So, at the very least after the reaction, the Games Cash reaction post show to State of Play, we're starting the launch party early going into this.

I'm trying to figure that out. And at the same time, we have codes for like a big game coming out that I also want to put a lot of time into. That's too we can do I appreciate that.

Ubisoft has confirmed that its annual Ubisoft Forward presentation will not take place this year.

Quote, \"We are always eager to connect with our players and showcase our games. We are continuing to explore opportunities to share updates and we look forward to providing more information at a later date,\" the representative to told Toillo. Totilla noted that Ubisoft may not have many games planned for the rest of the year, making a full presentation as opposed to showing trailers at another show potentially unnecessary.

Yeah, there's money in those hills. What if I just star in every single video game movie and become the video game person? Sydney Sweeney, you might be the person. You might be the person. Go do it.

No, I [\u00a0__\u00a0] love Smash. I've been waiting for about 5 and a half years of working here to prove my Smash ability. Really?

So like right now the need for I think the Nintendo audience is for a handheld thing, right? Because Nintendo was serving those two audiences for a very long time between handheld and home console and then that split their development teams put them in a weird place especially how with how the industry evolved with mobile and how um you know consoles got more powerful and Nintendo kind of got left behind. this was the perfect solution to all of that, right?

Like turns out that was the magical formula to make Nintendo like as powerful as they've ever been. Sure. Um, and I think that's it's hard for me to think of a future, at least a near future, where that doesn't remain the case as far as that being the most viable thing. But never say never as far as how things move and change. Like, who knows? Maybe cloud does become the next big frontier and everybody's chasing after that and Nintendo finds something that there that turns their whole business into something else.
