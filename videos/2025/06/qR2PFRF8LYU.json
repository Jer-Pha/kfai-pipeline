I I I think that this is going to be a fun time that people are going to respect in the pantheon of Mario Kart games. Yeah. But this is not going to be this is not going to be the future. Or if they do this as the future, it is going to be a much more fleshed out version that has the scope for a smaller experience like Mario Kart 8 or even going back to 64. Um cuz you you can't go bigger bigger bigger cuz I think you lose a lot of what I love about Mario Kart, which is some of the more intimate crazy fights. I I I just think that 24 people is a little too much sometimes as like the baseline already. I'm just having less fun than I have had with Mario Kart 8 cuz it just feels less tight. Um let's go into let's go into again I'm not the Mario Kart guy. I'm so excited to hear what Barrett thinks because he's the guy that you should really look to for Mario Kart Kart thoughts and opinions because he's played so much of Mario",

But either way, that's just my two cents as somebody who has not really raced against my world. We just do a Grand Prix. Herman How says, \"Knockout mode rules though, honestly.\" And I guess most people are not going to even play open world. I think that'll end up being the takeaway is that that'll be the standout mode and nobody will ever talk about open world. And then everyone be like, \"Huh?\" It's so interesting that like knockout tour has kind of influenced the entire game, right? Where like knockout tour I I think in any other world would have been oh they have one mode that's 24 people and it's knockout tour and then everything else is like the I forget what um I'm assuming it's half the amount of people maybe 12 people for Mario Kart uh 8.
