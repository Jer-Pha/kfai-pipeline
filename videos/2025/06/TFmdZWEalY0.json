Um you got to play it this fighting game u from Skybound Games, their new developer, Quarter Up. Quarter up. Pretty cool 3v3 tag fighting game set in the Invincible universe. How long did you get to play and what did you think? So about three weeks ago I got to go down uh to the animation studio where they animate Invincible. Um, and I was there for about an hour. The first half was them showing us the trailer and then presenting the game to us and talking about it. And then I got to spend about 30 minutes with my hands on the sticks and it was me and a developer and I was playing and he was telling me certain things of like how certain mechanics work and Question for you real quick. What up? Your hands on the sticks at this point. Blessing Adoya Jr. 2025 fighting games are back bigger and better than ever. Are sticks actual arcade fighting sticks or",

So, I got to play 30 Minutes and Greg, I'm curious cuz it sounds like you got to check it out, too. Yeah. Did you play it? Yep. Oh, yeah. I can't wait to talk to you about that. Um, I have a lot of takeaways. So, we saw this a couple of days ago. It was revealed at the Xbox showcase on Sunday and then the studio got a press release on Monday kind of breaking down a little bit about uh Quarter Up. At that reveal, I think all of us were kind of trepidacious about, all right, like, you know, we're seeing this after the Marvel fighting game was announced. Oh, we got 2X KO. Oh, man.

Now that I I can actually talk about this freely, my main takeaway from my preview is that one, this game is early. The studio started in 2023, and playing the game feeling and getting my hands on it right feels kind of early. Um, this game might be niche compared to a Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, but I do think that this game will find its place. I think this game, from my limited time with it, was very fun to play. I like it visually. I like it conceptually. I totally understand the um the concern around Invincible as an IP. Is there enough meat there to garner a community of like a fighting game based community? Is this the right direction? I think it is. I think that with the characters you have here and the team you have working on it, that's the place to start with it cuz this is QuarterUp Studios. Like I mentioned, they started",

That studio went on to be um uh taken by Amazon and the development for that game. pow, shut up, get in the car. But yeah, and that the development for that game uh got passed on to Iron Galaxy and they saw it through post-launch updates and all that stuff. And so Amazon ended up adopting that studio, having them work on um their internal games and a lot of the people that worked at that studio ended up leaving, right? And um this game was pitched to Skybound from people originally from that studio, higherups from that studio that were like, \"Yo, we want to make an invincible fighting game.\" And so this is coming from people who want to make",

This isn't a Skybound. We want to make a fighting game. Let's search out some people. Let's do this. No, this is people who are I would describe as fighting game sickles. Like one of the first things I heard when I walked in were like the studio heads. They were like, you know, chilling waiting for everybody to get there for the presentation cuz they're like doing it in groups of four media people at a time and they're sitting around like the donuts and food that were there and they were talking about Marvel vs. Capcom as soon as I got there. They were already talking about other fighting games and [\u00a0__\u00a0] and getting real nerdy about it which uh had me excited. But uh this is a 3v3 tag fighter. Um slated for 2026.

And it feels like a meld of certain things picked from certain other fighting games. Right. You got the 3v3 from Marvel vs. Capcom. You got the superhero sort of feel in combat of something I'd say like an Injustice. And then you also have, yeah, the violence of a Mortal Kombat minus the fatalities, right? But you do have essentially brutalities where there are certain ways that you end matches that'll explode somebody's head or explode somebody into a million pieces. I was like, \"Do you have fatalities?\" They're like, \"No, you're just going to punch him to death.\" Yeah. Cool. Exactly.

They had Mark, they had um Adam, they had Thula, who's one of the ultrammites, and then they had bulletproof. Exact same build I had. Cool. Yeah. And then I one of the questions I asked was, \"How many characters are we looking at?\" Exact same question I asked. I counted I literally counted the character slots and there were 17 character slots, but when I asked them, they were like, \"Hey, we're still figuring that out. We want to like, you know, we're that's one of the things that we're still working on for launch is seeing what characters we can get in there.\" And one of the other questions I asked was, \"What is the challenge of making a game that has a lot of people that are just very strong Superman style heroes,",

Mark, for example, is like a straightup brawler, right? Very physical character. You have Adam Eve who is very projectile based. Um Thula though is mid-range cuz she has like that long ponytail that she'll use to like kind of like almost like a Scorpion style throw at you to pull you in sort of thing. Bianca Beller. Yeah. Yeah. She has the Bianca Beller little whip action. Yeah. So, they balance that a lot as far as how they're approaching these different characters.

You have your light, medium, heavy, but then you also have um a tag button and you have a special button. Specials are uh work kind of like in Smash Brothers where uh you press a direction and you press A. Um and it's using a special, right? They wanted to develop this game to be friendly for casual players, newcomers, all that stuff. But then also they described it as a tournament quality brutal fighting game. Um, and they didn't really name drop EVO as much, but they made it seem like, yo, we want this game to show up at EVO. We want this game to show up um, at those spots. And in a lot of ways, in that way, it feels like a Dragon Ball Fighters where Dragon Ball Fighters had the auto combos. Dragon Ball Fighters had",

I honestly part of me would like it to get delayed to 2027 cuz when we're talking about 2026, we're talking about 2x KO and I believe Marvel the fighting game that just got announced got a 2026. Yeah, Tokcon Fighting Souls. I believe that got a 2026 window as well. Correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think this game should come out the same year as those games, right? I think this game has a really good opportunity to capture an audience. But three tag fighting games in the same year, I think is going to do is not going to do this thing the justice it deserves.

I would put this somewhere around that Fatal Fury, if not maybe even above Fatal Fury as far as like how expensive or or non-expensive or how budget it might feel.

It has like um they call them they have devastation arenas and they also have this thing called arena shifts, right? Um in quite a few of the areas uh there's a stage that's like the city stage that you're playing at. And as the fights progress, you have [\u00a0__\u00a0] destru uh getting destroyed in the background. And like the stage looks completely different from the beginning of the match um versus the end of the match based off of like the destruction that happens.

Now again I think because of the IP maybe that lessens like the it does this weird thing where I think it concentrates like the amount of people that might be interested in an invincible thing but also then captures the people that are already into invincible. So, I I do think there's the double-edged sword, and that is probably where the Power Rangers thing comes from as far as all right, we're talking about Invincible here, and you're turning that into a fighting game.
