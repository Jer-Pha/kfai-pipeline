We have all this and more because this is kind of funny games [Music] daily. Yo, what's up? Welcome to Count of Funny Games Daily for Tuesday, June 3rd, 2025. I'm one of your hosts, Blessing Addie Jr. Joining me is the Croy Poppy Tim Muggan Gettys. This week just keeps getting more and more hype and exciting, a state of play, a new Sabrina Carpenter song. Are we in the best timeline? Wait, a new song? Oh, we get a new song. I saw the teaser yesterday. I didn't know what what was up, what was happening. I was distracted by the teaser. We need the song of the summer. It's not here yet. Will we get it on June 5th? You're right. Yeah, we don't have a song of the summer. 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 p.m. Pacific. That's really exciting.

She's dropping the song Manchild at the moment that the Switch 2 launches. It's all connected. everybody. Oh, they had people listening to the show. Yeah, I think Mr. Nintendo heard the podcast and they were like, \"Ah, snap. That's a good idea. We got to get the carpenter on the phone.\" Uh, it's such a great week. I think a State of Play being announced was the thing to really pull it all together. I think there was something about the week where I'm like, \"All right, I'm excited for the Switch, too. I'm excited for Summer Game Fest. I'm excited for Xbox.\" Like, you know, it's all exciting, but I feel like there was that one piece missing, and now it's like, \"All right, cool.\" I",

It's always more exciting when there's that everyone's here vibe, you know, and like we don't have a Nintendo Direct. We don't need one. We're getting the games. We're getting a whole new experience with Nintendo. Like this is like this feels like old school that one magical week of showcases cuz I feel like sometimes Summer Gamefest and even E3 years feels a little scattered. Feels a little like, oh, it's getting too too unwieldy. There's too many showcases that we know are not going to have anything of consequence. Ubisoft from talking about you. We don't got that.

One of the preview events I went to was for the new Riot card game, Riftbound. The embargo is up now, but I can't talk about much. There's multiple embargos. The embargo right now, though. I can just talk about it very broadly. So, I'm actually not going to go that deep into it. I just want to reveal this box that they gave me on the way out, which is for like a box. No, it's a box. It's a box, but it looks like a book. It's a book box. Um, it says Riftbound League of Legends pre-launch summit. That was the thing I went to was the summit, right?

Um and I say that as somebody who I've not played every TCG obviously right like you also not the biggest at all Riot person. No, I feel like you're dabbling. You're starting to dabble.

And those have the same characters from like the League of Legends universe. I've seen Arcane, right? Like I dip my toe in here and there. Um, and I think Riot is doing a great job of making League of Legends something that you can get into beyond just League of Legends the mobile video game, which I really like and appreciate because as they were talking about these characters and showing off the stuff, I was like, \"Oh, I like this. Oh, I like that. Oh, I like I wonder if if this is one of the decks.\" Uh, okay. The deck I want to mention isn't here, so I'm not going to say it just in case.

We saw Shinobi saying that uh he hears it's going to happen, and Shinobi isn't always out there saying things, but when he does, it's probably going to end up happening, specifically when it's in the realm of spa of a PlayStation, right? So, not a surprise that we're getting this state of play. Um, I do think the timing is it's a little silly. It's a little weird to be so close to the Switch and like for them to announce it this late. But I also feel like PlayStation's been doing that recently with its uh showcases/ state of plays. Um, if there's a difference, if it even matters anymore. I was going to say, do you feel anything about this being a state of play, not a showcase?

I do still believe that the showcase brand exists and means more and they want to bring that back when they are ready to have multiple backto-back bangers. I don't think that that is going to happen and I think that them having intergalactic somewhere and go somewhere else like they're losing the ability to to have that anytime soon. That is what it is. Maybe the next one's for the PlayStation 6 leadup or something. I don't know. Um but this being a state of play I think if anything does at this point is not a factor. It anything can happen. We can get Cory Barlo's new game. We can only get third-party [\u00a0__\u00a0] games that we've seen a million times before in other places. We can get anything in between.

Resident Evil 9's going to be there. Oh yeah, I will. And I mean I feel like that is one of those like slam dunk ass predictions if I ever heard one. So I want to add some spice to this. We can't just say Resident Evil 9's going to be there. What are they calling this [\u00a0__\u00a0] So what we had Resident Evil, what was seven called? Biohazard. Resident Evil 7 vi turned into Biohazard. Like we had Resident Evil Village after that. The Vi turned into village. It's going to come down to where this Resident Evil takes place, right?

There's been a lot of conversation specifically from Dusk Golem, who is one of those leakers that gets things right and is very detailed about stuff and has been right about Resident Evil's many time. Sounds like this is a Lyon based adventure. Sounds like the game's had a lot of potential directions it could go, so it's a little messy on what it's going to actually be, but I think it's going to be third person based on what they're saying. Um, and it sounds like it's a pretty drastic departure from Seven and Village. Interesting. So, you think they're going back to like classic middle era evil? Again, from reading the reports from uh Dust Golem, it kind of sounds like it is finishing Leon's quote unquote trilogy of Resident Evil 2 4 and then now this.

Um I what I'm about to my prediction of the name directly contradicts what the leak is saying. The the leak is saying that it's not going to have nine in the title at all and it's going to be Resident Evil something else and it's not even going to play with the EX at all. I think it's straight up Resident Evil 9, not a Roman numeral nine. I think it's going to be a statement that this is the same but different. You know, it is a number. This is a core. This is not a Revelations or a [\u00a0__\u00a0] Outbreak 295 or whatever the hell. This is a core sequel to Resident Evil and we're not getting cute. This is We mean business.

They when they announce these games, they come out quickly. Yeah, I guess that's fair. But yeah, I It feels It doesn't feel like a Resident Evil's coming out this fall. I guess like I And it's not always this way, right? But I would think like maybe a 9-month lead for announcing to release. That sounds about right, too. Again, I feel like between six and nine months. Okay. That's not right. Between like four and nine months. before between four and nine. What's four? Between between four and seven between four and seven. Yeah. I mean, I'm saying it it could it could. Okay. Okay. No. Well, but sorry. Well, actually, if I'd expect it. Okay. Sorry.

But yeah, they've done that before. So, and this is a bigger deal. So, they've also been apparently been working on this one for a long ass time. I like how much detail you're putting into this prediction because I think there's a high chance that Resident Evil 9 is going to be shown tomorrow.

Now granted going back and playing Resident Evil 2 remake, Resident Evil 3 remake, Resident Evil 4 remake, there's a love for third person. Yeah, there is that classic thing. And to your point, if you want to make a statement and go, we're back, baby. Putting it I mean and especially if you have Leon, right? Like putting in you got to put it in third person if you have Leon as the main character. I don't think so. I like that prediction. I'm excited for it. I'm going to keep it on the horror side.

We're going to hop into the chat, see what you guys are saying, but my first prediction is that Fire Sprite is going to show up. Okay. They're going to announce Until Dawn 2. The sequel to Until Dawn. We're in Until Dawn season again. They brought it back last year with the remake. The Until Dawn movie is Is it out or came out when? It came out. the dog movie released. We reviewed it on this show. Yeah. No way. Uhhuh. Was I I was probably out of town, I think. Yeah. I don't know. That's crazy though. I would have went. I couldn't though.

Either way, I'm ecstatic. Ecstatic. I'm stoked for it. Um, but I saw Noble on Twitter when in replies to his own breaking news of the State of Play put a screenshot of Kratos versus Shovel Knight when they did that crossover in Shovel Knight and like the 2D pixel art. So, I'm just like probably just playing off of the the rumors that have been going around about it being a 2D game. But, I was thinking a little deeper about this since you said that. Bless think about it. The director, Eric, of God of War Ragnarok, remember when he was sitting right here at this desk, when we asked him like what game he would want to make? Yeah. What do you say? That Castlevania Symphony of the Night. Yeah. This does all add up a little too conveniently. Yeah. You know, it",

And that's funny cuz one of the things I wrote down is that that Greek God of War game will probably actually show up here. That's one of like my backup predictions. But yeah, I think that that makes the most sense. It was kind of tough to place before this state of play was announced. Um because I still do think that no matter what, I think a PlayStation thing is going to show up at Summer Game Fest cuz it's it's law. It always happens every like Summer Game Fest and Game Awards, you're usually getting some first party thing, whether big or very small.

As far as if it's a DReus or if it's like a just a regular God of War like thirdp person action game, but smaller. I'm totally down for that. But there's something about what if they put their full effort into making a Metroid vania style like Prince of Purge of the Lost Crown thing that just speaks to me.

In fact, I only lightly touched Mario Kart World's allimportant free roam mode, where hundreds of collectibles and missions await. A good chunk of my time with Mario Kart World was spent playing through the game's various Grand Prix courses, competing against 23 computer controlled opponents. Starting with a fresh save file, I wound up unlocking a handful of characters. Donkey Kong, Daisy, Rosalina, Lacatu, and Katqu Katquack. Do you know Katquack? Katquack. Katquack.

Uh, we had a segment toward the beginning about Hitman and this came up. So, if you want to hear us talk a bit more about IO Interactives showcase, go over there. Elen Ring Night Reign has sold 3.5 million copies. [\u00a0__\u00a0] crazy, man. I know we talk about From Software and Elen Ring a lot. You're kind of funny. Kevin, what is this? I got to know.

You know, I'm glad you're showing this cuz I did see this when I was doing news this morning and I was like, oh, it's a game called Egging On. We probably don't need this. But now, as I'm watching, looks pretty cool. I'm like, look, I should have put this in the show. So, thank you for bringing this up, Kevin. No problem. Um, but man, it's it's really crazy to remember back uh when when my friend Daniel Ortiz in college was just like, \"Oh man, there's this game Demon Souls. It's you got to try it. It's taken over my life.\" And I watched him play. I'm like, \"That looks like the least fun game I've ever seen. I want nothing to do with that.\" And then years later, the",

And then it built and built and started becoming way more mainstream. Elden Ring pops off game of the year left and right, but then it's backed up by sales, dude. When we're talking about Elden Ring, the core game, what 30 plus million at this point, like that is a bonafide hit. And then you're putting out a [\u00a0__\u00a0] multiplayer game that people, even the biggest fans, seem a little bit like like, I like it. Uh, but there's a lot of butts. You There's a lot of butts.

It is a multiplayer co-op rogike game that is very rough around the edges. Elder Ring. That's Elen Ring. Like, I don't know if this is going to like go crazy in sales. And now I'm like, oh, 3.5 million copies in a week. Okay. Yeah, I should have I should have known. My bad. My bad, Elen Ring. I forgot. I forgot you're from Software. And I forgot who you are.
