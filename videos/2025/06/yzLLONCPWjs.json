I'm joined today by blessing Adi Yoay Jr. Good day Tim. Greg Miller. Hi, Tim. And Andy Cortez. Good morning. How y'all doing? So good. Well, Andy, the best. What do you got in your hand? What you up to? I was just telling you about the Possessors demo. Possessors is the one of the games that Heart Machine is working on uh sidescroller from sidescrolling Metroid Vania and uh it was one of those that when they announced I was like, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] they're working on another game as well.\" But it's got a really good style and it looks crazy good on Steam Deck Oled. Yeah, I will download that tonight to play. Very exciting. I've been busy though with the Switch 2 obviously of course but also Tony Hawk's Pros Skater 3 and four demo. Oh yeah. Oh, I've been playing all that. The Foundry playing college. Oh man, good times out there. But this demo drives me crazy",

Greg, you're reliving your childhood where you would just play the demo over and over and over again. Exactly. Exactly. That's all you had. That's all that I have. A demo disc. Yeah. A beautiful thing. Lost to time. Everybody, how are you doing, Greg? I'm great. Excited to talk about some of these video games I played down in LA and then go play video games at my desk. Exactly. That's the thing. You uh went down to LA, played a whole bunch of games at Summer Gamef Fest Playdays, but then also was this a separate event or what was this? Uh so the Xbox stuff. Yeah.

And then there's Summer GameFest play days which are held at an actual place in Los Angeles where a whole bunch of uh jouros and creators and media and other video game people come together and play demos kind of like a very small scale E3 or something to that effect. Uh on Sunday of course was the Xbox presentation they did this year and they had taken over a different loft where they had multiple floors of games the media lounge for you to come in and watch the showcase like I did from there. I sat next to Rebecca Valentine across from Jason Shrier. Amazing. amazing moment whereas we all know the shry guy, right? Shy guy. Shy Guy's out there doing real work, doing real news, right?

There's they had just a great meeting room because it was just like just long desks with drops and cables and powers and everything was you there and it wasn't crowded. It was great. But the clock the countdown clock on the thing gets like four minutes and the some Xbox person turns off the lights in the room so that it'll be like a thing and Jason goes, \"A come on.\" So mad that they were turning off the lights in here and watch this like a theater presentation.

That's where I played with the rock ally. That's where I went and had hands-on with it and that's where I played uh games like the Outer Wild Outer Worlds [\u00a0__\u00a0] 2 uh Invincible Versus and uh Grounded Too. Hell yeah. What we talking about? Mhm. Blessing played Invincible too, didn't you? I did play Invincible versus Thank God because when I sat down and the guy's like, \"How much do you know about Invincible?\" I'm like, \"Sir, there's nothing you could teach me about Invincible.\" He's like, \"Cool.

The Outer Worlds 2 is the sequel to the award-winning firstperson sci-fi RPG from Obsidian Entertainment. Greg, what did you get to play with this one? Uh, I got to play what would have been probably 30 40 minutes of this. It was, you know, we had an hourong session, went in there, got right on sticks, had three different saves to choose from, which I'll explain because it's very important to all this. Uh, and then, yeah, we got some Q&A time. probably did 50, I would say, and then probably had 5 to 10 minutes uh with the team afterwards to ask them some questions about The Outer Worlds 2, Tim, a game I have been very excited for uh before ever playing it because I didn't love",

Uh but still wasn't like floored of like this was, you know, the best thing since sliced bread. What do you want to know, Tim? I want to know if you think that this one is going to be the best thing ever. Do you want me to put my hyperbole away or do you want me to start with hyperbole?

One of the things, and I forget if they talked about this in the video or if it was in my presentation, or maybe it was both, but really the idea that this is the first time they've been able to go into this world and this kind of game and this kind of RPG with money and time because of Xbox. And I think it really shines through uh in a number of different ways. And I think there's two big parts to talk about. Number one would be what I think me and Andy complained a lot about in our review. Combat. Yeah. Like it was like combat just doesn't feel good in the Outerorlds.

I don't think it felt good back in the Outer Worlds when we played it contemporarily, let alone now, right? It doesn't feel bad, but it doesn't feel good. There's no oomph. There's no impact. The weapons I didn't think were interesting. I know there's science weapons peppered in, but you could miss them easily and not have anything to do with them. Right? And then more importantly for me, and what I really love of my openw world western RPGs, right, is story, but more importantly customization. What you guys saw in the giant direct and in the story thing is as far as I know the story goes, right? What we played, like I said, was, hey, they gave us three different saves to start from. One that was combat focused, one that was sneaking focused, and one that was science focused. And one of my complaints with Outer Worlds on the replay was, I love being the sneaky person. I love",

I love coming in there hacking the system, doing the thing, stabbing the back, being done, da da da da da da. And I didn't think Outer Worlds served that to make that interesting for me or make that feel good. I never felt like I was doing something. My attacks from behind rarely killed people. They weren't doing, you know, like this isn't what I'm looking for from this. So, I went sneaking expecting it to be okay, cool. Like, it's going to be hopefully better, but how good could it be? It's so much better on the roleplaying aspect of it where immediately like when I got in there you you know pull up your radial wheel with all your different weapons andor like things to go in there.

Left on the D-pad. Yeah. Yeah. For a quick stealth kill, like a, you know, action moment. Bind it to whatever button you want. It ain't about that. But the idea was That's weird as [\u00a0__\u00a0] Why wouldn't it just be your melee? I don't I've seen plenty of games to have that have a Usually I think I think of a stealth attack being on like an A or an X or something like that.

So, you stealth the guy, but then you can use the dematerialized to spray them with acid and their body goes away. That way, other guards wouldn't find the body, right? Oh, okay. Then there was another one uh that I had on my this build, right, that was an N-ray scanner and basically it looks like Star-Lord's mask. You put it over your face and then you see X-ray through all the walls and stuff so you can see the enemies. We saw a couple clips of that where you would it seemed like a momentarily thing.

There was this mask. I'm sure there's going to be a bevy of weapons and things for your play style to go and do that way. Stealth kill on keyboard mouse is a semicolon. Uh but the idea right of going through and having that experience like immediately just from the start and using my stuff like oh wow this feels so different and then we kept I kept running into them and what we had said in our review the hope would be right of them saying hey we're going to have this feel different and look different like I came to a jam door and it pops up and it's like you could open this if you had engineering 7 which I didn't or if you had trait Brrawy which I thought was a",

And Bronny's just pure strength taking it down. That's that's a trait you pick or whatever from one of your character from when you've been doing this, right? Another thing, you know, Outer Worlds understandably is to the dialogue in the original was so good and so quirky and so fun. Same thing here of coming up to meeting people and then seeing like, okay, cool. I'm an ex-con, right? So, I had this little thing there indicating that that's a line just for me.

So really giving you an experience I feel it's going to be to your character rather than kind of letting me see everything which I'm appreciative. I like that. Yeah. Yeah. Getting in that way. And then yeah, getting to dive into, again, they talked about this in the show. I was excited for it. I think it works well. Uh the skills this time around, right, where in the Outer Worlds one, you got into the minutiae of it. you would go in, upgrade your stealth, upgrade your melee, and up once you got 50 points in there, then it would break off to, okay, now it's one-handed melee, two-handed melee.

And it's like, I'm just trying to explore this and have my RPG, my character be in this RPG, a smooth talker or whatever, right? Um, I like the idea here of what they're showing uh and what they talked about there of like now it's just over the top right of like you have guns, melee, sneak, lockpick, engineering, explosives, hack, medical, science, uh, observation, speech, and leadership, right? Those are the skills you're going in, you're putting your points into that then of course dictate uh what perks you're going to get to assign to it, right?

But we were entering into a Rift laboratory. Uh you see some of the Rift stuff out there and getting that Rift gun, which again felt so different from Outer Worlds, which always felt so boots on the ground, right? Like I'm here and I'm walking upstairs and I'm going here. But this was I got the rift gun and suddenly then there's the rifts in the world that they talked at a lot about uh in the presentation. But you find these rifts, you zap them, right? And then suddenly there's all these like broken platforms that you can then run and jump. And I we had we all all of the builds had double jump boots on them or whatever. So you could jump and then double jump and get there and you",

And again, whereas I think uh lots of times in these type of RPGs, whether it be Obsidian, whether it be Bethesda, whether it be somebody else, you feel so heavy and you don't feel like you're turning. Well, like this felt like I was actually first-person platforming in a really com way. Yeah, exactly. And again, that's such a great parallel of what we loved about Avowed was that combat. And to see it come over here again, like I stealth the whole way. I'm killing people, whatever. It pops off. I get out my shotgun. It's a two double barrel. It's got the kick. It feels good. It's taking them down. They're reacting. Eventually at the end, like, you know, the whole thing goes fubar. There's a giant robot to fight. Stealth's no longer the option. I go in there.

That'll be fun.\" But to find out what else they have under the hood, and they have it under the hood in a really minor way, too of like uh in of course uh the combat for Outer Worlds, uh we have that inhaler for your medical your medicine, right? Uh it was interesting in the last game, you know, you're you I had like 40 health packs, right? By the time I was to anything that mattered. So, it's just like you're healing all the time.

Overuse of the medical inhaler can cause you to experience a drug crash. While crashing, the inhaler is disabled, preventing you from healing further. To prevent crashes, ensure you're watching your toxicity closely. Investing in the medical skill can increase your toxicity as well. So now you have your health bar, but there's also a toxicity meter underneath it. So as you're taking this, it's affecting you. So you can't do what I was doing in Outer Worlds in the final battles, right? better just like [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm Jose Conco every syringe everything I got I'm eating it I'm like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm a [\u00a0__\u00a0] psychopath running out there right but so this and these choices like what I",

It seems like they are very committed to drilling down on this and making you have your own experience, which could all be marketing. It could be that we are 60% in and I've been playing the whole time and me and Andy really aren't that different.

It seems like they're making a world. And one of the things the developers kept talking about when we were there were reactive moments, which is the game reacting to what you've built. And again, I think they said it in the presentation a lot of like they know wanted this in Outer Worlds. They had it to some degree, but it wasn't where they actually envisioned it. I feel like this is closer than ever to what Obsidian's been envisioning with the world reacting to what you do, which is what I want out of these games.

And then we got to the big moment with like the underling, right? Uh who would be in the final boss if you didn't kill her, but I had to kill her. So, I killed her. And then it was hours later where I showed up somewhere and they were like, \"Oh, well, the corporate people like you, so you're okay in our book.\" And I'm like, \"I murdered all of them and evacuated that building and never came back.\" So, it's like I would have liked to have seen some like I'm hoping for more of that here.

Um, I have a lot of takeaways. So, we saw this a couple of days ago.

Oh man, it seems kind of like a crowded space. Oh, this is an original studio under Skybound. Now that I can actually talk about this freely, my main takeaway from my preview is that one, this game is early. the studio started in 2023 and playing the game and feeling and getting my hands on it right feels kind of early. Um, this game might be niche compared to a Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, but I do think that this game will find its place. I think this game from my limited time with it was very fun to play.

Like I mentioned, they started in 2023, this studio is a majority of is majority made up of people that worked on Killer Instinct 20 2013, which was the Xbox One launch Killer Instinct. That studio went on to be um uh taken by Amazon and the development for that game taken. Shut up, get in the car.

This isn't a Skybound, we want to make a fighting game. Let's search out some people. Let's do this. No, this is people who are I would describe as fighting game sickos.

They were like, you know, chilling, waiting for everybody to get there for the presentation cuz they're like doing it in groups of four media people at a time. and they're sitting around like the donuts and food that were there and they were talking about Marvel vs. Capcom as soon as I got there.

Um it's on everything and talking more about my takeaways from it of playing it. It is colorful. It is vibrant. is very violent, which I like, and it feels like a meld of certain things picked from certain other fighting games, right? You got the 3v3 from Marvel vs. Capcom. You got the superhero sort of feel in combat of something I'd say like an Injustice and then you also have, yeah, the violence of a Mortal Kombat minus the fatalities, right?

Um, they also have custom intros for certain characters where you'll enter a fight and it is Mark saying something to Omniman. In the build that I played, they only had four characters. They had Mark, they had um Adam, they had Thula, who's one of the ultramites, and then they had Bulletproof. Exact same build I had. Cool. Yeah. And then I one of the questions I asked was how many characters are we looking at? Exact same question I asked. I counted I literally counted the character slots and there were 17 character slots.

And they talked about how they were looking at certain character qualities and character aspects and making them feel original. Mark, for example, is like a straightup brawler, right? Very physical character. You have Adam Eve, who is very projectile based. Um, Thula though is mid-range because she has like that long ponytail that she'll use to like kind of like almost like a scorpion style throw at you to pull you in sort of thing. Bianca Belair. Yeah.

You have your light, medium, heavy, but then you also have um a tag button and you have a special button. Specials are uh work kind of like in Smash Brothers where uh you press a direction and you press A. Um and it's using a special, right? They wanted to develop this game to be friendly for casual players, newcomers, all that stuff. But then also they described it as a tournament quality brutal fighting game.

I'll put this somewhere around that Fatal Fury, if not maybe even above Fatal Fury as far as like how expensive or non-expensive or how budget it might feel. Like I think there will be a community for this, but depending on how it gets placed, depending on where it falls, it could be a challenging thing. Did you ever play Power Rangers Battle for the Grid? No, I didn't. because that I keep thinking of that game seeing this and like talking about even it being based on IP that is like people like but it's not you know something that I think is going to bring in millions and millions of people but Kev can you bring up Power Rangers Battle for the Grid?

I think this is more Marvel vs Capcom tag fighty than that one is. But um you saying that you'd put this potentially even above a fatal uh fury. That surprises me cuz I I know that that is a lower end fighting game, but it's still at its core like a proven entity in the space and like does every once in a while show up at a EVO or something. Well, I I think the reason I for me I'm looking at it as presentation and how good it feels to play and Fatal Fury the the latest one, City of the Wolves, that feels good to play and that looks good, but you can tell like it's like this is nowhere close to a Street Fighter kind of thing.

And like I played more even King of Fighters 15 uh than I played Fatal Fury. Invincible Versus has the stuff. And even as I'm looking at this, I totally understand where where you're coming from, Tim. But I I I do think the 10 years ago as well. So Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. I think the pedigree of the the people working at the studio here might speak more towards like it just feels a bit more natural. It feels right. Fighting games in terms of game feel oftent times like it's very it's very clear when something when a game doesn't have it.

And like the stage looks completely different from the beginning of the match um versus the end of the match based off of like the destruction that happens. Uh but then also midway through they have special moves where if you do it you can knock somebody all the way to the moon and then all of a sudden like you're playing on the moon kind of thing. Yeah.

But, I also think the fighting game community, if you make something that plays really good, IP almost doesn't matter. Like, I IP can just be like kind of the flavoring to, oh man, no, I just want to play Invincible versus cuz the game is fun. Yeah, cool stuff. I hope it has a story mode.

This is act one of the story for the kids lost uh this time in the park rather than the backyard. The first thing that spoke to me and this is somebody who again played Grounded on Night one and then 1.1 is how much better this one ran. Uh, and granted it's not fully live so we'll see if that actually happens when we're on real servers, but playing it uh I was like, man, this is running really well and it's looking really cool. um you know the bells and whistles they're getting in there and talking about we had a this is a similar thing where we played for I want to say 30 minutes and then had the interview time with them at the end of it or whatever and one of my questions was you know the story for me in my",

Why not just add to Grounded One? Why are we restarting? especially when they they they were boasting, you know, 25 million Grounded One players and they were very honest and open like listen, Grounded One had to run on the Xbox One and so that really hampered us in terms of what we could do. He's like the team originally, the original team on Grounded One, they wanted mounts, which of course they have mounts in this that are called buggies cuz they're buggy and they couldn't do that. They wanted this, they couldn't do it. So like it really was if we wanted to capitalize on what we had with Grounded One and make something here, we",

Um, if you've played grounded, it was very similar to that. Of course, I woke up, I ran into my research station, found ro raw science, and, you know, did this, made that, followed the tutorial of making the different things I was making. What was interesting and as a shakeup from this time around is you now have an omni tool. So, rather than have to carry, I'm carrying, you know, the axe, I'm carrying the etc., I'm carrying the whatever the things to help you craft, you get one omni tool that can be all of those things.

But uh you know I the story was forefront of this uh you know you get you like I said you you show up you're shrunk down you immediately go into the science center and you know there's this message from Sloan Bob who's like the corporate overload of this whole thing like giving you very good narration throughout what's going on being very funny and cheeky about what's going on.

Where I'm choosing I'm choosing my answers. I'm choosing what I'm saying. I'm choosing what I'm doing. Uh, so that I can go out there and do that. Uh, like I said, it was more grounded from somebody who's not the world's biggest grounded fan. Uh, it does obviously feel much improved in terms of how it plays, how it runs, these little bells and whistles and quality of life things. And so I'm excited for night one to jump back in and see what I think of it. But I don't know if it will grab me and keep me around because I'm just not the crafting guy.

The other thing to toss out I think that's interesting, right, is what they were saying of again dropping this with act one. They want to do bigger updates that are further spread out.
