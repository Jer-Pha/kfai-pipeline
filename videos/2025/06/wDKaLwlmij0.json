That's that's a little wild, you know, PlayStation coming through last minute. I was going to say not they weren't on your dance card to begin with. You know what I mean? Here they are. Here they are now. Uh, sneaking in in the beginning. It's going to be a great time. and we're going to live react after this. We'll do our games cast breaking down everything that we just saw. But of course, you're going to want to stay tuned to kind of funny all week long because the Switch 2 is here, Summer GameFest is here. Um later tonight at about 7:45, we're going live on the Twitch channel um to go all night long playing Mario Kart and all the other Nintendo Switch 2 launch titles, etc., etc. Checking things out, all the old games. Are they new again? We'll have to see. Uh and then of course live reacting on Friday to Jeff Keelley's",

Very excited. Um there are only a few things that I have expectations for and so I feel like there's a lot that they can surprise us with. Right. There have been the murmurss about the Greek God of War game and you know you imagine that we see it here today or Summer GameFest but more likely here today. Um there's that there's Capcom stuff always appears at State of Plays, right? And so I'm excited to see if we see a Resident Evil 9 if we see a Marvel vs. Capcom or whatever else they could be",

Uh, I think in the hullaloop that has been the Nintendo Switch 2 arriving today, being unboxed today, us going to the Nintendo store and streaming from there. Midnight launch, Mario Kart World, right into Jeff Keley, we're doing this thing outer. There's so much to talk about that I feel like entering this late in the frey, I keep forget, not forgetting, but like it's totally like it's a dark match. Like I'm not even paying attention that it's happening, that there's going to be a PlayStation state to play. So then to be here on the precipice of it, you know, right before we came out here, Kevin's like, \"You think they got something good this time?\" I'm like, I actually do, seeing as how they didn't have the usual disclaimers on the",

It's going to be this. Like, there's going to be some real stinkers here. Prepared. Uh, Andy, what about you? Um, I I think my expectations will always be down because to me, the February State of Play, nothing can reach the highs of that. how amazing that show was throughout ending with the Sorrowos reveal and Rahu Cole like I think that's as good as a state of play can get and uh I I don't really know what to expect. I'm kind of with Greg. It's such a weird shuffle of so many things happening right now that you know it's easier to hide behind 40 atrocities in one.

That's that's the second time what they say and you're knocking out of the park with both referenced for video games, you know. Yeah. I feel like it's a good time to be pumped for video games and I think that the timing of this state of play, it being the first of the showcases of this summer gamefest, I think is that funding of anything could happen cuz like obviously I I do think that uh Resident Evil 9 will be here and it makes the most sense here, but if it's not, it still could show up in other places. So, there's kind of like this fun thing of like even PlayStation stuff, right? If a big PlayStation thing that you're expecting here doesn't show up here, they usually show up at SGF. And so, yeah, there's so much potential of what the rest of the week can hold for us. Yeah, I'm not expecting this is going to be my favorite state of play ever, but I I do expect this to be a",

I'm expecting great from this. Yeah, that's the thing, right, where again I think since I haven't had time to cook on it and get all worked up or feel like I'm let down already by the blog post. I feel like there's a high likelihood for surprise and delight in this one in a way. Like you Xbox, I feel like we don't know everything, but I feel like I know a lot of what's probably going to be at Xbox. Of course, here it is. Like it is legitimately Shortinger's cat, right? Of like what are we about to get when we open this box? I mean, are we going to be happy? We going to be sad? We don't know. I had a Coke. How you doing? He's having a Coke right now.

I'm just saying if I was an athlete, all right, right before that 100 meter dash, I'm chugging a Coke cuz it feels good. It makes you feel good. It makes you think fast. That's from me to you. All right. Olympic brother. I got high excitement for this one. Excitement I guess from the place of I expect great things from the sense of I think in the last few summer PlayStation showcases or PlayStation I guess presentations. The SATA plays I think have had a better track record than even the PlayStation showcase itself, right? Like we always talk about the one that had all the multiplayer stuff, the Concord, the marathon reveal, all that [\u00a0__\u00a0] And like that was a PlayStation showcase. So when you remove that",

So when you remove that from the last few state of plays that have happened in the summer, they've been generally pretty good. Like we was fizzing a state of play. Mhm. Yeah. Like I guess you'll get you Yeah, we got a fizz. We got like I mean the fighting games right between Tekken and I think Street Fighter 6 for sure was announced at a state of play. Like those are kind of the tier of announcements that we're talking about and I think for that like for summer I think they've done a pretty good job with these. So I would expect the same. I predicted it for SGF, this would also be a good place to have Capcom come out, such a good partner, and talk about Monster Hunter and what the update is for this summer. Yeah, that's true. But yeah, I think Resident Evil makes a lot of sense. But in addition to Resident Evil games",

And like I I get the vibe that that shifted to the Jeff shows cuz we've seen a lot of like the rebirth updates and stuff from uh Summer Gamefest and Game Awards and stuff, but um it is definitely possible that if Final Fantasy 9 remake is finally going to show its face, it shows up here. I don't expect I think the thing about this one is there was so much that has a good chance of being here. I don't think all of it will, but the idea that there might be a God of War Metroid vania that we're about to see, that's exciting as hell. we might get gameplay of Sorrowos.

That was before we even knew it was going to be today. What other first party stuff do you think could show face here? See, I'm expecting partnerships. It's I think the PlayStation studios, actual owned studios are in weird places where Bluepoint, we know that they had a God of War multiplayer thing that was cancelled. Bend had a different thing that was canceled, right? Like we already know what Naughty Dog's working on and that doesn't feel like it's right around the corner. Sorrowos we know of. So I Yeah, Sorrowos update could make sense, but also maybe that you save that for September state of play. Like as far as the things that we don't know are happening. Fair games.

I mentioned that I wouldn't be surprised to not even see Marathon here even though that's a fall game, right? Like even with that stuff, they're in weird places. So for a first party, I would expect things like I think Lost Solicide is published by PlayStation, remember correctly. I might expect something like that. Whatever the team LFG project gummy bears game is, I think could make sense to to reveal here. Little Devil Inside perhaps. We're never seeing Little Devil Inside, but yeah, like more partnership stuff. I I I would expect that. Team LG is a great call. Yeah, we're going to see the We're going to We're not going",

Um I saw a couple people in the chat uh questioning if we know anything about this this PlayStation showcase or uh state of play. I know nothing about this. Do you guys I almost made a prediction then forgetting that I I have a demo for it at SGF. So that would have been bad. I don't know where that ties in if that would actually be here at Jeff or nowhere or what. Yeah, I know possibly one thing, but I don't know. I don't know if it's here. Yeah. Yeah. Again, exciting times. And I also feel like I don't need much from this. Like I feel like like a lot of the things we're talking about are exciting to me.

Uh later this month we got five new challenge levels now bringing it to a total of 90 planets. New special bots including Ghost of Yote characters and some more that they're not telling us yet. They're just teasing. And it's definitely going to be [\u00a0__\u00a0] Cloud Strife, baby. It's happening. Um, I hope uh they say, \"We're delighted to announce yet more additional content landing in Astrobot July 10th at 6:00 a.m. Pacific.\" Thank you for being that specific, guys. Uh, indeed, five brand new levels will make their way into the game as part of the Vicious Void Galaxy. Uh, as with our last update, the five levels were will require you to pull every bit of skill together to complete. So, hang on to your Dual Sense",
