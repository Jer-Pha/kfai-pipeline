[Music] What's up and welcome to Kind of Funny Games Daily for Thursday, June 5th, 2025, the official launch day of the Nintendo Switch 2. Of course, I'm your host, Tim Gettys. I'm joined today by Blessing Aoya Jr. Uh, I grew up with the PlayStation 2 version of Soulcalibur 2, and so I had [\u00a0__\u00a0] ass Hayachi as my special character for the game. And so to now be playing the GameCube version of Soulcalibur 2 and be playing with Link and everything is right. Everything is right. God, what a time to be alive. F-Zero GX is playable officially from Nintendo in 2025. It feels good. It feels real good. Feels real fast. I love it. Everybody, you're probably wondering, why are we at a different set right now? We're sitting on chairs instead of sitting at a desk. It's because it's the Switch 2 launch day. We're about to have a fun party stream after this of all",

We never stopped being live. Roger and Joey stayed literally the entire night. Uh Fran came through for a for many hours. Um Nick was there, me and Bless were there for a while. Greg was there, Andy. It was just like a a menagerie fun little party of people. What What do you want to say about last night? I mean, honestly, I'm sad that I couldn't stay longer. It was such an active day. It was such a busy day. And so, like to start it off with getting the Switch Twos in the office and then rolling that into I mean, y'all talking about Ballerina and then the State of Play, right, which was really big.

I ended up leaving at at uh midnight with Greg and I didn't want to. It was like such middle school sleepover vibes. And I haven't felt that in a long time. Like that type of experience. And it you can only get it when there's something fresh and new and there's an excitement in the air that everyone's like equally excited about. you know, a new console, Mario Kart, just boopping around, trying different things, friends complaining about how many frames per second it is.

Another thing for us to react to. And then, uh, Saturday, we're taking off, which really just means playing Mario Kart at home. Yeah. Yeah, finally get around to Delta Rune and then Exactly. And then Sunday, uh, we'll be back here in the studio at the desk reacting to the Xbox showcase, which I am very excited for. Would you say you're more excited for Summer GameFest or Xbox showcase?

Some unlucky individuals didn't receive the snack care package, while others received the snacks with other miscellaneous bonus goodies, including wet wipes, Tide samples, and band-aids. Apparently, Walmart knows just how messy a good gaming session can get. Reception has ranged from confusion to appreciation, with some believing this is some ploy to save face after Walmart started cancing pre-orders a few days before the Switch 2's release. No matter where you landed in the discussion, this bizarre pre-order bonus will be remembered when we look back on the Nintendo Switch 2's launch. What's going on, Tim?

And if if things keep going the way that they have been the last couple days, I should hit level 50 on Saturday, June 29th. Oh, that's a shame. Oh, that's a shame. Oh, I can't believe this just lined up this way. Mhm. I can't believe Joey didn't help me and tell me things you told her. Saturday, June 28th, Greg Miller Championship Parade. Probably around 11 am. We'll figure out the details on where we're meeting, but right now, just buy the shirt. All right. I earned it. You earned it. I earned it. All right. Thank you. Have a great show. Thank you.

Uh, several customers have gone to X and Reddit to report the issue, noting that the staples are puncturing through the Switch 2's thin packaging material and damaging the console screen. One such customer said stated on X that GameStop stapled the receipt for me and my friend Switch 2's to the box. Another from Rude Boy on X said, \"Hello, my Switch 2 has staple holes in the screen. They stapled the receipt to the box.\" What do we see?

This comes from Andy Robinson at BGC. He's freaking out here. Xenolade studio Monolith has confirmed it assisted development of today's big Switch 2 launch game, Mario Kart World. Posting on X, Monolith said it had assisted with the design of characters and courses for the Switch 2 game. Monolith, which is fully owned by Nintendo, has previously contributed to many first-p party games, including Splatoon, Animal Crossing, and Zelda. Interesting. Yeah, not too big of a surprise.

And yeah, and I'm trying to like not give too many of my actual impressions of Mario Kart or the Switch yet because we have other shows for that today. But uh one of the biggest observations I've had is how impressed I am with the open world. Like I'm not necessarily saying I like it better than just traditional Mario Kart courses. We'll have to wait for later for my thoughts on that. But uh I do think that it's like very fun to just drive around.

I just wish it was filled with more varied things to do and like more interesting things to explore and maybe as I play more I'll find some of that. But like as far as like the construction of it, I'm fairly impressed so far by how natural the world of Mario Kart World feels. And so, you know, maybe Monolith has a lot to do with that.

When creating new MI avatars, players won't be able to choose between male or female options like the Switch, but rather between two styles. The new system offers players a generic generic avatars with the option to customize the Mi. And if you're wondering whether or not the Mi characters were redesigned, no, they weren't.

Victor Fry says Xbox One had Snap and I loved it. Bring back picturein picture on consoles. You guys, I need you to understand how much I love Fran Mirabella. Every time the rare times I'm with him these days, it always just brings me so much joy. Last night's stream is a perfect example of it. But there's so many memories I have of Fran that will just never leave this noggin of mine. And one of them is him reviewing the Xbox One when it first came out and him essentially turning one of the IGN demo rooms into his private office for an entire week. [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah.

Kebab says to explain the George Lucas thing, the prequels often repeated specific story beats from the original trilogy, such as character escapes by hiding their ship on the back of something in an asteroid field. Lucas said, \"It's like poetry. It rhymes. Hopefully, it'll work. I'm going to stop asking things, you know, because I didn't need to know any of that. I didn't need to know any of that.
