Here joined with me for part one is none other than Tim M [\u00a0__\u00a0] Gettys playing some Crash Bandicoot. Tim, how are you doing today? I'm doing great. I'm very excited for this. I'm excited for your project coming out on Friday. Yeah, it's going to be uh amazing. I've seen little bits and pieces and I know about it and I'm ve I'm more excited for this than I think I've been for any of your prior projects and a lot of that's because I've seen your prior projects so I know how good this is going to be because of those. But on top of that, I just love Naughty Dog so much. Going all the way back to Crash Bandicoot, the original one. If I'm being honest, I haven't played any Naughty Dong game pre- Crash Bandicoot.

So, we're we're starting off uh Naughty Dog Week. Uh if you missed it, yes. Uh this Friday uh on youtube.com/confunname exclusively. Uh I will be premiering my new video essay titled I replayed every Naughty Dog game. And that was that title I went with because it's not really an in review. There's not like a ranking in it. It's more about the journey. So I was just like what's the simplest way to convey what this video is?

It's like it it gives very much a cojima of like I watched this movie. Yeah. 100%. Yeah. But I love that stuff.

You know, if you're not ranking them necessarily, what what is going to be the content? It's the journey. It's going to be good. But yeah, it's funny.

So, but a year and a half. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that is something I I will talk about a little bit in the Crash 1 segment of the video is like it's it kind of dawned on me of like how interesting it is that this came out like 3 weeks before Mario 64 came out in the US of like and thinking about the Naughty Dog games after Mario 64 and all that stuff.

We'll get to the game in a second, but uh Crash Bandicoot was one of the first real video games that I ever played out of like self-interest, if that makes sense, where it's like, you know, growing up if you could play a video game, you play the video game. It's like whatever you at the you were drawn to. This was one that was I mean and I guess it is the same story of what I just said, but uh one of the rare times that uh it wasn't a babysitter situation, but it was more of just like a hang out with a slightly older kid situation after school, you know what I mean?

Uh, and the older sister had a PlayStation and Crash Bandicoot and I was obsessed with it because I loved 2D Mario more than anything. I didn't have it in N64, so I'd played Mario 64 and had my mind blown at like Toys R Us and stuff at the demo kiosk, but it wasn't a couple of years until I actually got to to play through that. So, Crash Bandicoot to me was the actual realization of the promise of 2D platformers in 3D. Yes, Mario 64 is such a different thing, but the get from point A to point B, there's obstacles. linear linear. Yeah.

And that was like she might have had the other ones as well, but like Crash Warped was like the one that I remember the most.

Charox says, \"It sucks there isn't a way to play the originals on modern consoles. I still prefer the original Crash 2 over the insane version, especially the goated soundtrack. That is one of the complicated things with these type of remakes where on one hand, I absolutely love this game and everything that it did. And on the soundtrack, there's actually some parts that I prefer the new version. Yeah. But a big thing for me is nailing the color vibes of a game when you remake it.

Um, we were funny, funnily enough, talking about a similar situation with um, uh, the homie Stew when uh, he was in office to talk about uh, y'all's time with um, Tony Hawk. We were talking about um, Mario Kart's Rainbow Road, like N64 and like I had gone back to the original N64 version of that Rainbow Road for the first time in a long time and I was like, damn, there's such a specific vibe here that is definitely lost in the recreation Mario Kart 8.

And then like even off the track like in the N64 version it's just like pitch black and it kind of feels like a weird like you're almost driving on like a a highway in space and especially with like the the neon lights and stuff and they like do a little bit too much I would say to like detail that and adapt it to to modern stuff. But yeah, this this definitely suffers from that a little bit as well. Banana says, \"I can smell my mom being sorry.

Oh, I'm so curious to know what Intergalactic would be like. Do you think it could be something along the lines of Jedi Fall in Order, combat, semi-open world, several planets? Um, from what I understand from interviews, it sounds like it's just going to be that one planet, which which correct me if I'm wrong.
