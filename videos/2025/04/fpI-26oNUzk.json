I'm excited for this Games Daily, but I'm even more excited for the games cast after. Oh yeah, cuz we're doing another [\u00a0__\u00a0] list episode and this is a every once in a while a list will come along the gaming world and they'll just start tweet the people out there will start tweeting at us like, \"Guys, don't look at this list. You need to do a [\u00a0__\u00a0] list on it. And this might be the most requested one that we've ever gotten. I can't wait for this because the Do you want to say the topic of it?

And people are in a tizzy about it, which I'm excited for cuz for a list like this, it's almost like we get to do a two-parter games cast in one where the first half of the show we get to just talk about like what do we think are the most influential games of all time, which ends up just being a great conversation period, but then yeah, the second half of it gets to be a reaction. It's like it's it's all the good kind of funny content mashed into one thing which is why analysis and reaction and reacting and so I'm very excited for that.

When the game was first debuted during the Switch 2 Direct, many fans expected the game to be packed in with the system, but it was quickly clarified that the game would be a paid experience. Nintendo has defended the decision with Nintendo's Bill Trinan saying that the $9.99 cost quote is not an exorbitant price end quote in his eyes and that it's a pretty robust piece of software with a lot of great detail in there. But Fizz, who was president and COO of Nintendo of America during the height of its success with the Nintendo Wii, has seemingly made a sly comment on the decision referencing referencing his push to pack in Wii Sports with the Wii.

He continues, \"During the development of Wii and Wii Sports, the goal was we wanted the system to be attractive to not only the most active players but to new players. we saw uh Wii Sports as the way to be able to do that.\" End quote. He went on to explain in another clip from the same podcast that the game was only packed in with the Wii in certain regions, which he argues led to the console being more successful in those regions than its native Japan.

And you know, it sucks that it seems like they're they're not continuing that kind of uh understanding of a great way to sell not just sell consoles, but also for the type of software that it is. a very clear introduction to the system and its capabilities. Um, so it's fun to hear Reggie be able to kind of just parrot his own words back now. Uh, and kind of being aligned with how we've been even talking about it, right? Yeah. Yeah.

So, it's easier to just kind of be like, \"Well, back in my day, we did it this way and it worked this way. Why wouldn't you do that again?\" But, I do think that uh to what exactly we're talking about here, specifically the welcome tour for the Switch 2 being $10.

And I I feel like we all get that, you know, like this is the type of game that like is seemingly designed to be a pack in. So, it does kind of just I think read very u you know, and tonedeaf in a way that like it just was a very unforced error that occurred here. And I I feel like with the way that the the information roll out from Nintendo's happened over the last week, it's just another negative talking point. I think like another thing for us to kind of look at and go, \"What? Why?\" Yeah. I think I I wish it was called something else other than Welcome Tour because I think the framing of it being the this is the tech demo to teach you how to play. This is the manual for the console.

And if that's what if that's what it is, then 10,000% it should be a packing, right? And there's a conversation to be had there. I almost wonder if they called it Switch play kind of like Wii Play, right? And like framed it more of a as a no, this is an actual game. Like there's an actual like experience that you might come back to all do all that [\u00a0__\u00a0] right? still would be grubby from the sense of we all have eyes or like most of us have eyes, right?

Almost as if it was supposed to be free and then at the last second they're like, \"Oh, actually we need more money out of this out of this thing, right?\" Like it it is weird. A question that I'll throw to you, Tim. Is this overblown? I think this is one of those ones. I think we can all agree that this is wrong. Are we too angry at this? I mean, that that goes back to what I was saying of just like two things can be true of it's worth $10, but also it should be free. It's just just like there's that.

I think Nintendo did a very bad job communicating a lot of things about the Switch 2. Um, the fact that the price wasn't even in the Direct Clearly, I think is evidence to the way that they were trying to own the messaging maybe a little too much, like maybe just a bit to their they didn't want to get in the weeds, but then they did get in the weeds about a lot of other things. And I feel like with the direct we got and then the information we got directly after and obviously the tariffs and so many other things um are at play. There's a lot of questions people had that Nintendo didn't answer even though they could have and it now starts to look like well it's because they don't they know",

Do the JoyCons have Hall effect sticks? No, they don't. We didn't know that until almost a week later, right? I think those little things add up. Are the full games on the cartridges? Are games $90? there was so much misinformation because there wasn't clear information. And I think that that was Nintendo's biggest mistake. Um, and then not being able to have like some type of FAQ page that has up-to-date, accurate information to remedy the negative YouTube headlines. There's the other side of it of people are going to be upset about every little thing um, and blow it out of proportion in a way of how big of a deal it actually is in terms of how many people it affects.

So much of that is speaking to a I'm sorry niche audience when we're talking about these physical uh game collectors. I also understand those physical game collectors, myself included, are going to be angry and going to be very vocal about it. rightfully so because we see the writing on the wall that the death of what we love is looming. So Nintendo kind of hiding or just kind of being a little bit weird about the facts of all that stuff. While I completely understand it from a business perspective, they're like, \"Well, majority of people don't care about this.\" Like, why would we lead with any news that's bad at all when we can just not bring up something that is going to be",

I need to download it. That sucks.\" Yeah. And then they're just gonna download it. I think move on with their life. There's also the marketing thing that I think is still grubby, right, of but but I think is the reality. And PlayStation, I think, does this too where you leave out the the news that you know is bad because the VOD is going to stick on your channel forever, right?

I'm still playing Mario Kart. Nothing going to stop me from playing Mario Kart. That's where it's at is I I just think that these are all very valid concerns.

And and that's the thing is, you know, there was a chat from way earlier that was this not overblown, it's emblematic of a larger issue, which kind of is what you were getting at before of when these things compound of these smaller things that people are mad at. Then it turns into a bigger thing when it isn't just um oh I had to pay $10 for welcome tour like for a while there, right? Just knowing I had to pay a price for welcome tour.

There's somebody in chat that was like um uh like Switch owner like do people do the I think this might have been off you actually. Do people not want to know the price?

And so I wouldn't be surprised if they were like, \"Hey, let's not announce the price just in case we or during the direct just in case we need to shift it and then we don't have a video that is just looming of a false price.\" Yeah. That we want to have. Yeah.

It doesn't function just as a pro controller and obviously that doesn't sound good and that's straight from Nintendo.

Every aspect about the Nintendo Switch 2, people care about. You know what I mean? And that is where I think it kind of turns into the the chip damage thing of like, sure, you might not care about the GameCube controller, but I do, but you might care more about the having to download the the the games uh the the update packs or expansion packs or whatever or or XYZ.

Speaking about clarifications, right, this is Chris Golian at Video Games Chronicle. Nintendo has clarified the situation regarding physical Switch 2 edition cartridges. Confusion arose last week when a Nintendo customer service representative told one user that Switch 2 Edition games would include the base Switch One game as well as the upgrade in the form of a download code. Nintendo has now stated that this is not the case and that Switch 2 edition games will contain both the game and the upgrade on the cartridge itself. In a statement to Vuks, uh Nintendo spokesperson said, quote, \"Physical versions of Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Switch game",
