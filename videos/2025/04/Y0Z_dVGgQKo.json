Yeah, it's a special one. Different timing as well. I know you're used to having games cast after games daily, but no, you get a fun special stream with me and Andy and some awesome developers for an awesome sponsored stream about a game we'll tell you about in just a moment. But after that, you will get the Games Cast. So, you get your normal kind of funny programming, but let's focus on the now because the now is where we're going to have a whole lot of fun. Andy, we're back for an awesome sponsored stream to play Lost Skies with the development team. How does that sound, Mike? I'm ready to get back into this game.

Mike is exciting to get his own giant warship, but we'll talk about that cuz that's future endgame stuff. Of course. Of course. But of course, let me welcome in the dev team because why have me explain the game to you, which we've already played this game before.

I'm a principal developer at BA and for the last four years, yeah, we've been cooking up this uh this game Lost Skies for you. Uh so what is it to me? Um that's a that's a really loaded question to be honest with you man. Um we've basically had this vision in our head for going on 10 years. We brought out an MMO. Um yeah 10 yeah 10 years ago we started developing an MMO called Worlds of Drift and we were just so enamored by the concept by the world by everything that was in it that when we had to sunset it we wanted to we wanted it to not die. So Lost Skies is our sort of kind of I guess our attempt to to bring it back to life in a more sustainable way. So, it's not an MMO this time. It's something you can",

I think we got another guy here. He can do a good job as well explaining his thoughts on the game. We have Luke, the lead designer on the game. Luke, how are you? Uh yeah, I'm good, thanks. And uh yeah, like like uh Mike said, lead designer uh been going at this. Yeah, I mean we had the initial sort of concept just hit 10 years ago. Um and uh yeah, we kind of like I think we took stock.

I believe the prototype for this game was October 2021. We just wrapped up our previous game, I am Fish. Um, and then we moved on to make this kind of prototype. Then it got kind of green lit at the start of 22. Um, and so yeah, it's been about 3 years fulltime. Exciting stuff.

I mean, so I mean the the originator kind of concept I mean that came I mean it originally was the main references were uh Legend of Zelda Wind Waker and Skies of Arcadia. Um, and I kind of mashed the two. And at the time, Daisy was the only kind of major survival game. And we were like, \"Okay, like let's let's kind of like tap into that.\" Like, we like the idea of base building, but you know, what you find is you build your base and then you kind of just you you don't really go out much further. You kind of maybe once you've once you've planted your roots, you you kind of go out not too far, then kind of come back. And I think the the is almost like a little bit of a barrier when you're like, \"Oh, we need to go to this part of the world and build a a",

Um, so the core kind of conceit with this game is always, well, you take your base with you. Um, and and then how far can we push that? which is why you'll find, you know, not only is it your home in the sky, you you need it to travel to to other islands. Um, but also you'll need it to fight sort of, you know, sky filling world bosses and and other threats in the sky. Um, so with the way we've always sort of described it, it's like it's your home, but also your battleship. That's so cool. That that's how we so me and Mike felt kind of that way with uh a game that we that I love.

I This is probably where I start to fall off, you know, and and the idea of the sort of ever moving base, I think, is just awesome as hell. I freaking love that.\" Yeah, that's where I like the raft, right, where you are the base and the base just moves with you. But uh yeah, I really like I really like that. That's a good call. Yeah, I mean the initial concept as well was a entire unconducted terrain kind of like how you would have in in Valheim, but it quickly it's like how do you constrain the player? Um how how do we stop them from just running off in every direction? And so this was kind of like a solution to that which is like well you can't you need a ship. It's it's uh you can't bypass",

So, a lot of the game is like, you know, like weighing up that sort of, oh, I've spent a long time on this base, but now I have to go risk it to like to do this this this huge objective. So, you kind of like maybe it's a spoiler, but maybe you don't want to use the base the the ship that you've built that is your home for the uh for the big boss fight.

So, you build cannons and machine guns on your ship. They're all mountable by different players. So, one person can be the pilot trying to avoid the attacks from the from the boss while the others are manning the things. Someone could just be on repair duty. Poor guy.

I really really enjoyed that system. Yeah. Yeah, I mean when we were coming back to this concept, we you know, we we already actually weirdly had influences from Zelda, which was Wind Waker, which I always find it quite funny that when when Nintendo announced their kind of where they went back to for Breath of the Wild, they cited Wind Waker, um as that kind of like here's a here here's an open world and there's",

And that was always a core part of of of of this game was just I look out across the horizon and I can travel to anywhere I want assuming I buy a ship of course but or build a ship of course. Um but that was always the key kind of hook, an exploration hook, right? Um and again like you said this I've always I've not been a huge fan of survival games where they're like you need to spend a talent point to unlock like a pickaxe and things like this. it kind of and I really like the Valheim system of like hey when you get the materials you kind of automatically learn the the relevant things.

They're they're items that were used in the past that you've now unlocked rather than just, you know, you put some stone sticks together, right? I love that.

Thank you to all of you for tuning in. Don't forget to wishlist the game right now to support these awesome devs. Get that game up on the watch charts so people can go out there and engage with it. And then of course Friday hopefully me and Andy will see you out there on one of the sky islands. You can come join us and have some fun. Uh with that, that will end today's awesome afternoon stream. We're going to move into today's Games Cast and even more kind of funny content live here on Twitch and on YouTube. So with that, goodbye gamers. We'll see you on the next show. Bye everybody.
