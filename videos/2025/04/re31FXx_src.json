The main character, Atsu, has a big trauma in her childhood and goes on a journey to get revenge. End quote. The game will see the player hunt down the Yotay 6, a group of warriors that have caused death and destruction across Japan. As the player hunts them down, a sash worn by the protagonist, Atsu, will display the names of the Yotay 6 that she is pursuing. So far, I'm reading really well. Oh, you're killing it. You're killing it. Also, when you hear the Yotay 6, does that not make you think of of like a rap group? It's like the rival group to Wuang Clan. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

Wow, nice. That's beautiful. Players will be able to approach the Yotay 6 in any order, and the game will also introduce new combat, new close combat weaponry. Both Japanese cinema and western dramas have inspired the game. Quote, \"In terms of an open world adventure, Ghost of Yote has the greatest freedom and biggest map of any open world game we have ever made,\" Fox told Famitsu. \"More details.

Not to say that I didn't enjoy my short amount of time with Assassin's Creed Shadows, but playing it, I kept on thinking, man, I really can't wait for whatever Yot's whatever Sucker Punch is going to do with Yote. In addition to playing Rise of the Ronin and being like, man, this is just missing that Sushi Mas. I can't wait to get back to anything that Sucker Punch is going to be creating in this world.

Yeah, exactly. Um, but I get more excited and I think it's more worthwhile to tackle an open world with the open world being a factor into how we're tackling the main objectives, the main story, right? We can go anywhere. How do we make that fun? How do we make that interesting? How do we make how do we make it so that players actually feel like they have that freedom within the world?

Um it wasn't like you could do your list of people you had to kill in any order, but they would be like, \"Hey, here's a like group of four of like the 12 that you can now go out and hunt.\" But then it was kind of like it wasn't locked, but it was kind of like you should be higher level to take on this dude and like all this stuff.

Yeah. And people are putting out in chat that like um I think is is it CJ Splitson who says I don't think they're using a level system anymore.

I'll speak to it from the POV of an indie. By the way, I have no experience working in the AAA space, so I'm not sure what sort of uh deals are cooked up there, but we've shipped two games on Game Pass, and we're very happy with both. So, all I can say is I'm happy with the experience I've had. Um, and you know, I I think that works in certain situations. Yeah. Not all, obviously.

Yeah. Who knows how many players are over there. Yeah. I mean, I think a million copies sold for this like makes this overall they did the right they did the right things here, right?

Like from the outside looking in on this, I think this is a net positive for all involved in putting out this game.

I guess that wouldn't work, but like I'm only halfway through the game. We'll see. Um, but if you make a sequel to Clear Obscure, right, or when you make your next big game even, I think there will be the audience that is, \"Oh, I played Sandfall Interactives last game.
