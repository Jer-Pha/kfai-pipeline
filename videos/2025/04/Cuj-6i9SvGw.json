Of course, I'm your host Tim Gettys. I'm joined today by blessing Addio Jr. Good day Tim. Greg Miller. Keep my stars warm Tim and Andy Cortez. Good morning. Oh god, it's I just want it to end. I'm sure you do. You know, I often forget about it and then you often remind me. I never want you to forget. It could happen anytime. Right, Barrett? Just kidding. It's not happening right now. God, thank God. Uh, it just got real bright. God shining down on me. Um, I'm excited about this. Here's the deal. Mario Kart World Direct happened this morning at 6:00 a.m. our time. We did not wake up early for this one. Uh, so we are watching it a couple hours later on delay, but we do not have the chat up. If we're not spoiling ourselves, none of us have seen it. None of us know what is shown here, if it's good, if it's bad, what surprises are shown.",

Nintendo benched him. Thought he was in jail. Are you all expecting a lot of surprises? I mean, like, you all saw a decent amount of it, right? Like we played a lot of this game, bro. I mean, are you all are you all expecting stuff to be like, \"Oh, whoa, that's crazy.\" I don't think we played a lot. Yeah, we played a lot of specific things. Specific things. What are you expecting as people who have had hands on? Are we going to see a new mode here? Are we going to see deeper dives into characters? I want to see what the open world stuff is.

Like, there was things going on, but it's not like there was like any quests or missions and stuff. So, that's what I want to see. I I want to see like what are what's the single player content here like like you guys were having a good conversation on Games Daily yesterday about story mode and like it doesn't necessarily need to be a story but it's like a campaign mode, career mode, whatever the [\u00a0__\u00a0] you want to call it.

So, we had to wait a little bit. So, it gave me like 10 minutes to just kind of drive around and there were a ton of, um, item boxes that had food and if you get the food, it gives you a different costume. So that's kind of and my question is that I hope the answer here is that like you're now unlocking that costume forever or is it just changing you in that second, you know? Um but yeah, really the big thing I want to see answered here is why is this game $80?

Give me a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ton of the shrine equivalent in Mario Kart. What are you looking for, Andy? Um, definitely some awesome open world stuff.

You brought that up and I I don't think that that's a crazy request. Like obviously we're not going to be getting like what's on So what is it? But what would it be? Would it just be Nintendo tunes? I think so. I mean, or even just just like Nintendo. Oh, that'd be smart if they could like get Nintendo music. I mean, that would be amazing. That'd be amazing.

But we'll see. I I want I also am very excited to see what old tracks they bring back for this one.

I don't know why that wasn't something that I initially thought would even be a possibility.\" But I think I kind of undersold myself on how excited I'd be about the the customizable costumes. I think they all look freaking cool. And it's it them all having to sort of take shape to whatever character you're using just seems like such a a large amount of work because all these characters are so differently shaped.

We know what it's going to be.\" But like how stupid of me to have even said that cuz this thing just looks so I I can't believe how amazing and how exciting uh or how excited I am for a Mario Kart game that I'm never It's an own quantity to the point where I just thought I'll be happy with",

And I feel like as far as what we got out of this direct, it kind of hit the the standard that I was looking for, right? It had everything that I wanted. Of course, there are certain dreams where I'm like, these are dream dream things that we're probably not going to get and we didn't necessarily get like every single thing that I was looking for out of that, right?

Guess what? Based on whatever food you pick up that then transforms you into a specific costume. I think that's I think that's really cool.

I'm with Andy as far as I'm going to no life that to a certain extent, but I worry that those might be the main and slash only things in the open world, right?

Yes. So, yeah, I was looking for more of a Forts Horizon like experience. That is a high bar to hit. In fact, nobody hits that bar except for Fortz of Horizon. But, you know, I think for a Mario Kart game that is looking to be a bit more colle collectible focused, right, doing these challenges and stuff. I think this was an opportunity. We'll see when it comes out of how cool this P block stuff is and how cool it is collecting the coins.

It'll work for sure. Obviously, they showed a bunch of different things, but are we both unlocking things? Is it one of those where I need to be grinding stuff on my own? Should we be grinding on our own and then playing online together with our switches that way? You know what I mean? But like that is such a amazing thought to have.

I've been obsessed with Mario Kart forever. I think that Mario Kart 8 and 8 Deluxe, like that is the pinnacle of how Mario Kart and Cart Racer should feel. And having played this, they're just continuing that. And I think really improving on uh most if not all of the the mechanics of it.

Um, so it's not like it doesn't feel like every item you get hit by is like a pre-anned animation that you're you're falling the exact same way. And I think that goes a long way uh in just improving the feel. However, the rail grinding stuff does feel pre-anned. It does feel like you're on Tony Hawk. It No, it doesn't. It just It just feels kind of like you're just on this thing and you're going at a a pretty set speed.

Um, I think that the examples they showed here were a little basic and reminded me of the mission mode in Mario Kart DS, which was fine, but now it's just kind of instead of it just being like a menu, it's you have to drive somewhere to get the thing. And I just don't know how engaging that's all going to be. Sure. But the",

The reason why I'm okay with it for this one is it the way that they built out the world does still allow you to do those knockout tour things. Um, and I think they needed to have some kind of connected tissue. They needed to have some kind of world built out so you can have those races. Um, and those races will be worth it, right?

I have a uh question for the Mario Kart pros on the panel today. Uh Barrett Courtney, Tim Gettys, Blessing Jr. Greg, you're here as well. You can listen to this question. Um for more possible DLC packs, there's obviously a very noticeable lack of Squid Kids Link. is do we think that that has anything to do with the fact that Kirby's air ride air riders coming back is its own IP and like Kirby's racing over there so we can't really have Kirby racing over here or we can't bring in Link here because then that would mean Kirby should also probably be here but Kirby's over there air riding it up like I I'm just kind of blown away by this only being Mario Kart characters with as many",

I don't know what it is cuz Yeah. looking at the I mean me and Mike talked about it yesterday of like all right this is your chance you have knockout tour what if you translated that to battle mode somehow like made it a cool I don't know battle royale kind of thing and like they just did another battle mode I don't I don't know how you fix it though like I don't know yeah maybe battle mode is just just a legacy thing where people if it's not there people be going to be mad but if it is there people aren't going to play it but you do it anyway yeah let's make a big map the team stuff's interesting I mean this being 24 players like I really do wonder if the online and is going to work well enough. And I I think that the easy assumption to say is like, no, it's Nintendo, lol. But I also think Nintendo's online has improved drastically the last couple years. So, I'm kind of going into this",

But the promise of this game of like being able to have that many people, that many friends together, all just hanging out, doing stuff. If they pull that off, this is going to be one of the biggest games of all time. Do you think they pull off? I don't know. Like that's the thing is like there has to be things to do, enough things to do that are worthwhile as a group cuz like some of the group chat stuff they were showing there, like I'd go as far as saying it looked lame. Like let's go, let's go, let's go. It's like I don't know, man. I can't see us doing that. But if we could be team kind of funny out there trouncing kids, that'd be kind of fun.",

I think the idea of having four squads with a bunch of different players on that that excites me. Like I I love the idea of all of us having to collectively try to destroy other teams. Um, Rick L with the membership uh says chimps don't have tails. I had to say it. Diddy is a monkey. So I, you know, there's certain things. They're not going to change Diddy to a chimp. There's certain things that I I stand by. I don't want to hear about Gone with the Wind. Those monkeys did have tails, though. Oh, did they? Yeah. Oh, never mind.

Yeah. And I don't want to hear about monkeys. Andy knows. We did Planet of the Apes in review. Uhhuh. We got it wrong every single goddamn time. What type of monkey it was? Excuse me. What type of whatever the hell thing it was? Whatever, dude. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it here. I just want Diddy Pack. Put the shirt on the monkey. Anything else you guys want to talk about? I don't know why you're so mad. Cinemmaniac says there is 200 cc. Was at the LA event and they confirmed 200 cc. Ours was stuck at 100. Now, who confirmed it? Yeah. Was it one of the demo people? Cuz we can't [\u00a0__\u00a0] trust those people. Trust them. They say don't talk to them. I'm interested about that. Well, that's it.
