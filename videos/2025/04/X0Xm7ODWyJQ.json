I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside Forbes 30 under 30, aka the second best baby blues in the world, aka the biggest Oni Musha fan I know at Tim Gettys. That's me. It's true. I at this point, we're now four months removed from the Game Awards where Oni Musha way of the sword. If there's an or I'm going to lose my mind. Um, and I think that it might be my most re-watched piece of my own content. Okay. Ever. Okay. Okay. That's definitely between that and the Sora reveal. Uh, where me and Bless like completely broke down. Uh, but yeah, the Onimusha Way of the Sword reveal was a very big deal to me because obviously I'm a big big fan of the franchise. Never really expected it to come back, let alone in such a big way. Yeah. Um, and just to have On Musha be talked about, not just for the new one, but also Onimusha 2 getting remastered is another thing that I I never thought we",

I'm a huge Johnny Musha fan, but you know, came out in a time when I was a lot younger. It's not like we I had as much disposable income as I I do now. So, you can't play every game you want to play.

This was like one of those things like again different times like he played it at my house. I watched him play it. I might have played we might have traded the controller back and forth but I would say it was my experience with On Misha 2 was his playthrough of the game. You know what I mean? And then Onish 3, it was the opposite. He watched me play. I don't know why it happened that way but kids are kids, right? Yeah. Yeah.

And um I've tried going back to play to to, you know, finish the story and actually complete it and I just found it way too hard because of the tank controls. Um sure, of course one the remaster solved that problem. Not only was it widescreen, now it's a lot prettier. It just ran better, a lot of quality of life um fixes, but you can actually walk around in analog controls. And that went a very long way. But even when that came out in 2019, the remastered version, I ended up not beating I I played about halfway through and I was like, you know what, is old game old? I'm not so sure, you know. Yeah.

And I think especially in a uh time and place now where we've seen what Resident Evil was and what Resident Evil has become. Sure. And both in new installments and in remakes and all of that stuff. There's something that is so pure about the pre-rendered backgrounds in this era of games. And on Musha very much was kind of the PlayStation 2's Resident Evil.

Yo, what's up? Welcome to the game showdown. Stars in the bank. passion. I'm your host, blessing add Jr. I'm joined by two contestants representing two teams. We got Tim Getty's representing team orange. We sure do. And we have Greg Miller representing team How do you think the interview went? It went great. It went great, Greg. Now, the rules are simple. I have a trivia question worth one of Tim's stars. Yes. If Greg gets the question right, he gets to take one of Tim's stars. If Tim gets it right, he gets to keep all of his stars. One star.

The popular movie franchise Ghostbusters has been adapted into many video games over the years. What was the name of the 2023 VR Ghost? Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord. Ghostbusters Rise of the Ghost Lord is the correct answer. Greg, that's the worst day of my life. It was the best day and that just changed. You have just won one of Tim Stars, I believe, tying us up for the season. Now, here's the thing, Greg. I want to give you the one-time option of triple or nothing, Greg, since you got the question right. I want Roger falling apart over here. It's over. Uh, I want to give you the option to go triple or nothing. All right. If you say yes, here are the rules.

The arithmetic I It makes sense. It makes sense. It makes sense. You're basically trading back your team. You keep the stars that you've earned is what Okay. Okay. Okay. I get blue and I win. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You would take the stars you currently have and you would become team blue. And then I would take the stars I currently have and become team orange. Correct. But the so to make So the the deal here is you ask Tim a question. No, this is going for both of you. This is the same scenario. And what how many what is the star total for each of us right now with me having that one? Barry, you can bring up the star tracker. I know I'm",

You can earn the three right here. But if you get it wrong, Tim gets my money back. But what if neither of us get it? Then nobody get it. What happens then? Well, I guess it's nothing, right?

You each will get two chances to guess the top answers for the prompt. Because he's the challenger, Greg will go first. The prompt is name a game with a lot of climbing. For this one, I'll accept franchise answers. And also for context, this is from a spring 2024 poll. So you're not getting answers from after spring of this of last year. We're going to start off with Greg Miller. Uncharted. Greg says Uncharted. Uncharted is our 50 point answer. Tim, of course, this is regular kind of rule, so you each get two guesses here.

Dude, you should have felt my heart when we were waiting for you to finish this episode. You want to go through the lineage, but then I also know the audience doesn't think that way. And so then it gets to well, what is the audience thinking on this one? Are they more recent? Are they thinking historically? And you are accepting franchises. Franchises.
