This is because quote the game and city known as San Vansterdam. I like it. Are designed to be a living, breathing, massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox. And both are always online and always evolving. According to a recent column by the developer, skate players will notice changes to San Amsterdam itself as time goes on, as well as quote smaller things like live events and other in-game activities. And so the studio can deliver on its vision. Skate will always require a live connection. Full Circle says this may not be a surprise to anyone who has been part of Skate's play test, but it may still be a surprise to those who haven't been partaking. After all, the original games were offline. Then again, the Skate Revival will be a free-to-play title on its release, so perhaps some were already expecting an online",

In addition to chatting about the lack of an offline mode, the Skate team also addressed the play test microtransactions. As reported in March, microtransactions were added during the game's closed alpha test. Quote, \"We know that using real money during a play test is a little unusual, but we think it's the best way to properly assess and adjust the system before launch,\" Full Circle said today. If you see prices or other things changing over time, please understand that this is normal. And of course, you will receive the amount you spend during play test in San Van Bucks SVB when we I like that less. When we reset for early access launch, end quote.

It's just always where people are at. And and I hope that developers know and understand that, you know, amazing games get cancelled and have their servers shut down.

I also am of the belief that where we get into trouble with will this be DOA, will it not? Blah blah is EA. What is EA expecting out of this? What does EA need out of this?

Well, I still I imagine there's going to be a bunch of missions and stuff already. Are you are you kind of arguing me or are you No, no. I'm just wondering like your school of thought on this because I think a lot of people have drawn the line on now this is a live service product when it should just be Skate 4, right? like $70 out the bag, give me the full experience. Cuz I think my worry goes to now with this live service thing is we're going to play early access and all of a sudden I'm going to jump in to San Fsterdam and it's going to have four dudes with missions and then eventually those missions will run out and it's like well now I'm jumping into an open world to skate which is what I want to do but",

So you're coming in with a very uh worthy argument and I appreciate that. I love it but you're [\u00a0__\u00a0] wrong. No, I'm kidding. Uh, no, of course, if they launch in early access and there's four jabronies giving you things and that's it. That sucks. I hate that. Now, of course, is that going to be the full game when we get to launch and it is 1.0, whatever. My counter to that would be two examples of I think that do it well so far and that don't do it well. Number one being Monster Hunter, where you know how much I I love Monster Hunter and how much I've played Monster Hunter vanilla and here's this Blossom Festival with new [\u00a0__\u00a0] to go earn and no stuff to do and they're going to",

I'm going to put Monster Hunter down like I was saying right after our stream today until there's the next big update I want to come back to because that's exciting for me, right? I like being able to come back to a world I'm invested in. My counter. So, like that's right there of like why I wouldn't want it just to be, hey, here's the package skate and it's done. I'd rather have a reason to come skate over and over again. My other example of doing it wrong, I think, is Animal Crossing. Animal Crossing was the biggest [\u00a0__\u00a0] thing in the world. Had a tiger by a tail. We all love that. I love that so much. We majority of us all loved it so much, right? Played the [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of it. Was it checking in every day",

There is a skate game and experience they're putting out after early access, which I still don't I don't want to judge them on, right?

Do you can you sell a smaller amount of people on a $70 product and is that worth it for your studio to then fund the next thing or whatever? for the live service game that's free and we hope a lot of y'all people are spending money on it in order to fund whatever this is cuz if you're not funding it and if you're not keeping alive it will die and that looks like a failure and I think it's a lot easier to frame the live service stuff our servers are going down a year and a half after it's easier to frame that as a failure and like man what a [\u00a0__\u00a0] they took a big L there then we put out a campaign game we sold however many copies for 70 bucks we still made money.

You play, you beat the game, you play with your friends, and when you're done with the game, you're done with the game. And it and because of that, you can't frame this as an L if people stop playing because the game is done, you know? Yeah. And like another wrinkle of just like the always online and all the stuff of like I think for a skate game, especially with the the first three, you know, my memories aren't like playing really online skate. It's having friends over and we're playing offline and doing all the fun modes and stuff is like um you know, Greg, you're talking about like going back and stuff for your dailies.

Um, and then also with the dead on arrival thing, I don't think it'll be dead on arrival because I think what that game is offering is uh a bit more unique than a lot of other like live services uh games that are usually more like shooter focused. Um, I think it'll be something similar that was also released under EA was Knockout City. Uh, I I don't think Knockout City was free to play to start.

Powers unknown lie within the monolith. But those are no mere ruins as an expedition has already ventured inside with only a few survivors. Why was it built? What powers reside within? Who is at the center of the monolith? All these secrets and more will be uncovered if you are brave enough to take on Imperial.
