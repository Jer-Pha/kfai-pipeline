I'll give it to you. I'm going to say cuz now now what I'm realizing is that when I just like spit out an answer, it actually works out. So what does it feel like? I'm going to say it's some random scene in Bioshock Infinite. That's what I'm saying. All right. Bioshock Infinite. Random scene in Bioshock Infinite. [Music] Dude, chat. He ran away. Let's go.

[Music] I mean, it sounds like a game that I played, but I'd never heard the song before in my life. That sounds like something I played. I am lost at this point. Uh, let us see.

Uh Mario versus Donkey Kong. That whistle did give Mario franchise vibes. [Music] [\u00a0__\u00a0] I definitely know this game. I kind of want to say like a Mario Party, but like it sounds all too epic. Reminder that uh we've already had a Mario Party show it. Oh, good point.
