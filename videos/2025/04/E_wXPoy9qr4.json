I'll never forget sitting at the old studio space in the Nintendo Direct and all of a sudden the four starts coming in and it's or no no it was the the Samus logo the S and it starts coming in and it was like oh my god oh my god it's happening and then the four and it was like oh my god oh my god we're about to play Metroid Prime 4 on the Nintendo Switch and then it caught really bad um situations right had a re had a restart development a long wait long wait and I remember when the debut happened like I was popping popping off like, \"Oh my god, it's Metroid. Oh my god, it's Prime 4. Oh my god, it's going to be retro. Oh, it's not retro.\" Huh. Hm. Who's it going to be? That's kind of weird. Um, and then after all, did you ever learn who it was? I don't think so. I don't think so. Uh, but we know who it is now. It's retro. Let's just go back",

My Okay, first off, even though this demo was probably the same length as the other demos we got to do, somehow not long enough of a demo for this game, I needed more time with this, right? Like, it felt real quick. like we got to do a whole section and then we did a we ended with a boss fight and once I finished it I was like oh that's it that's all. And so like I my impressions feel light even though I'm sure as we talk about it we're going to get deep. Um I think first thing to point out is that uh the setup that we played we got to play with uh the Joy-Con as a mouse.

It's not a button that you press. It's not a setting. you pick it up and start controlling and you then play with the two Joy-Cons. So, I was going kind of back and forth with that. Uh, playing this game with the mouse functionality, extremely smooth. Uh, and that part of that is the 120 fps. 120 frames per second in 1080p. Uh, it still looked great. We're playing on the TV. That was the only way we were allowed to play this. We couldn't play it in handhelds. We couldn't play it in 4K and any of that stuff, even though they're saying it's 4K 60. Um, and I mean, I was incredibly impressed. I felt the 120 frames. What about you? Yeah. No, for sure. Like this thing felt smooth as hell,",

Like this thing felt smooth as hell, especially playing with the mouse mode, right? Like that was the thing that blew me away. But honestly, even before getting to gameplay, the cut scenes that we saw blew me away as well, just in terms of the visual fidelity of it. I was looking at I was like, \"Wow, this is next Nintendo gen right here. Like this is the you know what I mean?\" And we were playing on Switch too. Uh but yeah, it's it's it's funny. But uh visually to me it it's very interesting because you compare this. I saw a lot of people after the direct last week uh comparing Metroid Prime 4 gameplay to Halo 4 gameplay. Uh and Halo 4 just looks way better. Yeah. But it doesn't because the art style. There's just there's something about this style that like there they if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

And I think that they kind of just really nailed what they had to with this visually. Yes. And so that's my thing is once you get into gameplay, it is 1000,000% Metroid Prime. And that is I think the best thing, right? As somebody who played Metroid Prime Remastered a couple years ago for the first time and was blown away by it. This felt like getting back to form, right? Um, you know, it was the I that's it's tough to talk about like the level experience that we had cuz it really was a hey, here's how to play Metroid real quick. You know what I mean? Hey, shoot the door to open the door. We essentially got to play what we've seen in the Metroid Prime uh trailers like in in the specifically that uh and it was kind of a tutorial section as well.

I will say they give you the things that you want to have pretty quickly, right, of like, all right, morph into get into the morph ball. All right, here's how you drop a bomb. All right, here's how you shoot a door. All right, here's how you scan and all that stuff, right? So, they give you that stuff pretty quickly to to uh introduce it and then you get into the boss fight and they do put you to the test. Um, but in all of that, it just felt right. And that was both in mouse mode, which we can talk about in a second, but then also playing on JoyCons, right? the control scheme is what you expect it to be and it just felt right. It felt like",

One, because it did feel right, but also, we talked about this in uh the hardware impressions, broke my brain as far as All right, so I'm pressing the buttons while I'm in mouse mode. I'm pressing the A to jump on the right Joy-Con, even though I'm I have it being held sideways. No, you know what? In the hardware conversation, we were asking if the mouse uh stuff switched controls. It did because uh it switches it so that jump is on your left trigger now. You can use your left hand to jump. You could also do other things, but like it did add functionality to jump a different way. Yes. Okay. Um but even still, right, like I had the thing every now and then of even though I'm in mouse mode, I'm using the right analog stick and the right analog stick",

And so it's a weird thing to get used to though over the course of however long like I'm sure it's going to be a pretty quick process to get used to it. I think that if you just commit to one of the control styles, it's going to work and make sense. And I think the mouse mode is a very legitimate way to play. If you're looking at this and you want to play with mouse and I keep want to say mouse, keyboard, but mouse and left Joy-Con, I think it's a very legitimate way to play. The dream, some would say. You know what I mean? For years, I've been trying to pioneer this experience and now we finally have it. Not exactly how I want it. I was saying this the hardware thing.

Uh and it's very hard to not hit that uh when you're you're just playing the game naturally holding a and that's the thing, too, is like you put a mouse down and the mouse just stays where it is. You put the Joy-Con down, it might fall over, you know what I mean? You kind of need to like keep your hand locked there and it's a little just different. Maybe people get used to it. I don't see myself playing this way. Having said that, playing this way is pretty awesome. Like the uh it the it feels amazing. the 120 frames per second with the mouse, you're moving around. It is pinpoint accurate. And it was like, man, I don't know that I need this for a Metroid game. But having it kind of opens up a lot of",

But having it kind of opens up a lot of opportunities. There's a lot of doors we would get to that, you know, it's tutorial. You kind of go to the door, you scan it, and then like four different like color circles point pop up, and you need to like shoot each one to open the door. And I was like, I'm going to do this with mouse mode. I think that'll be fun. And it kind of was fun. I think it kind of added to the experience there. simple little thing, tutorial mode, but I was like, \"This feels good.\" My nitpick with Metroid Prime specifically out of all the first person shooters, right, Metroid Prime 4 with mouse mode is um Metroid Prime has that lock on function. Yep. And so you lock on and bullets will automatically like fly to the enemies that you're fighting. But like I don't know, there's something about it that feels weird",

So that's the one thing where I think that is really what broke my brain. It was the fact that I wanted to press the buttons, but then also like that lock on feels a little bit weird with the mouse. And again, that is the the brain breaking situation, but I also found uh once I like pushed through that, I found some opportunities to do some pretty interesting gameplay stuff with that where I'm like I was kind of impressed with the amount of enemies that were in an area at once and how big the area would be. So, I'd lock on to one enemy on the top left and I'm like I I do a like charge a shot, shoot it, and then whip the mouse over cuz I knew there was another enemy on like the",

And it just felt a lot faster and quicker than using an analog stick to do it. Um, and then being able to like lock on so it kind of like pulled it to him. It felt really badass, you know what I mean? Which I I I think is uh pretty pretty legit because like that's another great thing about especially early Metroid.

Like that's what I'm talking about. This is Metroid baby. This early in the game too, I'm like, oh man. Like I I like the different phases. I I liked how Yeah. Like they have you doing different things, right? Like you're shooting the different You start off shooting these different orbs that he has on him and once you get the orbs down, right? Like his big weak spot opens up and you shoot that. But like he might he had the um",

But then yeah, you get into the thing where he's throwing the big energy shield at you and yeah, you're hopping over it. You're going to the morph ball. You're dodging all around. And then also like uh I like that ear this early on. Assuming that it's early on, right? like it feels early on in the game. I don't think they actually said that this is the beginning or not. No seem like it kind of seems like I can see like a cut scene to set it up and then boom, you're into this and then title screen and then maybe it slows down. Yeah, they didn't set up where we're at in the game, but it feels early, right? So like but being at",

Scan this thing, go up, now you're in the vents, you're in the morph ball. It just feels like like home, but it also it like you keep saying classic and oh man, it feels classic. And and I mean, you know, Metroid Prime is now an old game. 25 years old, something like that. 24 maybe. Like that is uh incredibly dating me.

I I don't think it's going to change the minds of people that are going into this of like first person shooters aren't this. Metroid Prime, I've been fighting this fight for 25 years. Nintendo fans, Metroid fans, people like like, \"Oh, why would you play this? There's Halo right there.\" It's like, it's not a first-p person shooter. It's a first person adventure. There's puzzle, there's combat, there's so many different elements to it. It's a Metroid vania but in 3D first person. Yeah. And we haven't got to touch the psychic abilities. We haven't got to there's so much we don't know. So, uh you said it earlier. It's like there's not much to break down here. Uh because like the devil wasn't that long, but everything we got I was",

Playing through this I'm like okay this is what ex this is exactly what you want it to be. It's exactly what we think it's going to be. And that couldn't excite me more right? Like, you know, you you make the reference to old game is old, but also old game is good. As somebody who played that old game two years ago, old game is still good. Old game is fire, actually. And I mean, you know, after almost 10 years since they announced this, it's so nice that we know when it's coming. It's so nice that we have a release date for this game. And I know when I'm going to be playing it. He lied. We don't have a release date for this game. Why don't we? And I get we can't have all the answers at once, but",

And I get we can't have all the answers at once, but like I will also say on that I'm very happy it's not at launch because I really really really didn't want Nintendo to put this game out to die. Um especially after this long. And I think putting it out with my Mario Kart as well as the biggest suite of third party titles ever. Uh first time CD Project Red's ever been at a a console launch period. Like stay out of the way. Stay out of the way. Let Metroid have its moment. Metroid Prime 4 Beyond so far deserves its moment 1000%. Till next time. Love you all. Goodbye, Bonanza.",
