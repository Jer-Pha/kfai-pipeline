How are you feeling post the announcement of the Nintendo Switch 2? I feel good about it. You know, we we we've we've waited waited for it for a long time, right? I feel like come on Nintendo, where's the Switch 2? We're finally there, right? It's going to be out in a couple of months. You've played it. You know, it's real. It exists. We now know almost everything we need to know about. There's still some things out there, but we've got a clear sense of what it is now, right? And what the proposition is.

No, no, don't love that. Right. But what's thing is that it's it's at least comparable. It's in the ballpark. It's not going to feel like you've taken a big step back and you will still get your OLED screen. You will you'll get your upgrade down the road. Exactly.

I think the big thing me and Tim kind of talked about this and like I Tim helped me kind of confirm why I thought this way of it feels like a more premium switch. And I think Tim helped settle it in a way of oh it it's the JoyCons, right? It's that it's those magnets. The JoyCons are so strapped into that thing that that click on thing. So, what's it like when it clicks on, do you get a little Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, I I do get a little like, \"Oh, that's satisfying.\" I don't like the the part that's not satisfying is clicking them off cuz they kind of just plop off, right?

And so, like when it plops off, I'm like, \"Okay, cool.\" It's so much better than those fiddly rails that we used to have, right? Getting I used to have really have to like pull. There were times when it would feel like it would get stuck and you're like and you have to like pull am I gonna break this thing? That's that to me is like that alone is a big cuz also with the switch you're constantly because the you in my house at least you do switch back and forth between the use cases a lot right like sometimes it's docked sometimes you want to take the like we play a lot of um you know party games with the family in the house and you you all want your Joycons so you have to snap them off the control off the base unit and that is sometimes a",

No, you're not you're not going to detach this thing. Like the worst you can do is like if you are either a child or an idiot if you try to like if you really try you could you can can you defeat the magnet? I you might break you'll probably break your switch if I'm if I'm being honest. But like again that's going to take a lot of strength. So that's because these magnets are really strong.

Over the weekend, let me tell you, I played so much Blueprints. Blueprints, right? I mean, we knew it was coming, but the reactions I'm seeing this morning is like, \"Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] Paris is saying game of the year.\" Rebecca Valentine was very affusive about it. You're saying it's this is suddenly like a contender. I'm saving my impressions for a Games Cast. But what I'll say is that the most upsetting uh part of this review for me is that I didn't finish the game because I was not smart enough to get there sadly. Like that's my problem.

When they first showed this as part of like I think they showed it as part of a showcase of other games, right? And it was just it was just one of the other games that was in there. It wasn't necessarily one that stood out as like, \"Oh, that looks special, right?\" So, I'm sure some people did, but it wasn't like a game that was generating a lot of buzz out of that showcase.

Jason Shri, to spoil a little bit of the review, I ran into Jason Shrier at the Nintendo event and we talked a little bit about Blueprints. When I asked him how many hours of Blueprints have you played, he told me he played over 100 hours. And so, we're going to have a lot to talk about. I'm excited about it. Yeah. And it's coming and it's out this week, right? Game Pass. Yeah. We're going to have to try it. And and Gary, you you say you're not a puzzle guy. I I I enjoy puzzles, but like the puzzle focused genre of video games I don't really gravitate towards. And I really clicked with this one.

There's definitely like but I think the way it again we'll save this for the games cast but specifically Gary there's always something to pick apart if you've lost a thread somewhere you have like other threads to kind of like go off and hit like a dead end or anything. Yeah. And the rope like nature of it just in and of itself is just really fun and I'm excited. There's going to be a lot to loves she loves puzzle games. So, I think the two of us together will probably enjoy playing it. And and this is what I'll say, right? Cuz Blueprints, and I should I should specify the name of this game is Blue Prince.

Nintendo Switch 2 JoyCons won't feature Hall effect analog sticks. The company has confirmed the long rumored feature, which would mark a significant upgrade on the original JoyCons won't be included in the launch models of the console. Hall effects sticks named after US physicist Edwin Hall use magnets and electric electrical conductors to measure the position of the stick which make them effectively immune from drift an issue that has affected many original Switch owners. When asked by Nintendo Life about the new JoyCons and their components, Nintendo confirmed that Hall effect sticks would be missing. Quote, \"Well, the Joycon 2's controllers have been designed from the ground up,\" said Nate Bu uh Build Bildorf, a senior vice president of product development and publishing. \"They're not Hall effect sticks, but hey, they feel really good.\" End quote.

End quote. Nintendo has claimed Switch 2's new Joy-Con analog sticks will be more durable than on Switch One uh when asked about the potential stick drift issues. Now, Gary, how deep are you into the well of Hall effect sticks and the conversations about them? I know a little bit about it. I I have a Hall effect stick.

Everyone's talking about Hall effect. So yeah, I should try it out and see what the deal is. The the thing with Hall effect, as far as I can tell, is it's not that you're going to pick it up immediately and go, \"Oh, this is so much more responsive.\" It's that they're not they're much less likely to [\u00a0__\u00a0] the bed a year from now, right?

And so time will tell and you won't know right away if there if there are issues with these sticks. These are stories that we're going to be hearing about, you know, 3 months, 6 months, a year from now, right? Because again, it's not going to be an instant thing. So I, you know, it'll be interesting to know why they didn't choose. It feels like Hall, like I said, Hall effect is so buzzy for them to be able like, \"Oh, and Hall effect sticks.\" Like a lot of people that don't necessarily know what that is just go like, \"Oh, I've heard of that.

We don't It may well be that the solution they've come up with is better than Hall effect or as good as on or we we we don't know yet. We're going to we're going to take a minute.

And they've chosen not to do that as they often choose not to do many things that would seem to make common sense to the rest of us. We'll find out whether or not it was a good or bad decision in time. Yeah, that's the thing is it's going to be the wait and see. Um, and I definitely understand the frustration at this, right?

And I love them one minute, I'm pulling my hair out the next. One thing that I do think Nintendo cares about and is very good at is preserving the integrity of like the core gameplay experience, right? It's why the games are so [\u00a0__\u00a0] good, right? And I don't think they would allow, even if they were to implement achievements, I think they would have many more guard rails and rules in terms of developer guidelines to say you can't",

Yeah, that is something you like collect every Cororox, you can see get an achievement for that. Nintendo doesn't do that. They they reward you in a better way, right? You collect those Cororox seeds and you can trade them in to get an extra heart. So, it's actually something that rewards you in a tangible way in the core gameplay experience, not just here's 10 extra points that don't mean anything. Here's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] NFT virtual trophy.

That's not actually in the game. a bit siloed and also but I but also that's that's a decision that they made for some reason they looked at Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom specifically and went oh we can add some kind of achievement achievement thing here. My one it's not even a problem but I guess my one thing to elevate it would be the thing that I do like about PlayStation and Xbox achievement systems is that there's more of a social thing around them where I can go to my friend's profile and see all the achievements they've gotten.

Game chat and you just uh you know hit up give it to a chat with your friend and then they can stream to you. Well, this is this is the reason why I say it is like Nintendo is pushing social features really hard with Nintendo Switch 2. They introduce game chat. They have a [\u00a0__\u00a0] camera that you can buy and that I'm sure people aren't gonna use in nefarious ways. Listen, I used to play Uno on the Xbox 360. I've seen it all.

And I don't think that stuff is going to be as I guess elevated by the audience as it could be without something like an achieve like a passive achievement system. I think you need passive like social features. You need a feed.

We need to point out here that our interview with Trenan was conducted on April 3rd prior to Nintendo's announcement about delaying the Switch 2 pre-orders in the US due to the potential impact of tariffs and subsequent concern that Nintendo may raise the price of the console and its games further as a result. Trin said there's more to Welcome Tour than it appears uh based on the showing during the Nintendo Direct and even during recent hands-on opportunities the media had access to based on what's actually in the game.

Honestly, it brings me back to I mean this is a big conversation. We got to move on, right? But like Yeah. Like you have to, right? As Epic the they never made a GTA movie which still blows my mind. We got stories around that and that's all that matters. Yeah. But like you don't I mean for companies like this, right? Like especially right now for Fortnite. Back in the day for GTA, I get it cuz video game movies fail a lot. Nowadays you want to make a Fortnite that's just money.

I never confirmed three, but everybody wants it to be three, but I said one. Um but yeah, he's torturing Tim over it. Got it.

This is Vicky Blake at IGN. Bungie is finally ready to show us more of its upcoming PvP extraction shooter, Marathon, with an allnew gameplay live stream slated for this Saturday, April 12th.

Players realized that within the ASI art uh was a snippet of footage from the initial trailer. And if they look closely, they notice it's the runner sprinting down a hall from the trailer.

It has this really cool kind of futuristic vibe to it. So many games these days kind of look look the same. They have these muddy color palettes or it's this very generic version of the future, you know, futuristic aesthetic. This to me looks really fresh. I love I love the the the the palette, the colors.
