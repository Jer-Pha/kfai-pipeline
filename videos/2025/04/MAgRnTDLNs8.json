Like I just add it, right? It's becomes a lot e uh pretty easy right there. But I would say also just a lot of showcases. I think I've I think maybe a year ago when we had another one of these showcases that were always you know sometimes you get that sort of mentality of ah this could have been an email bug and just put but I've totally turned my my way of thinking on that because I don't remember things.

I don't fully know all of the details on it, but Void Breaker, this looks awesome. Void Breaker was on the triple eye initiative thing and of course it looked awesome and there was a lot of other stuff that looked awesome.

Void Breaker is a rog light first-person shooter with and if you're an audio listener, I'll just describe it like this. Go watch the video. This looks rad. It's the control sort of telekinesis grab gravity function where you're grabbing things to throw and destroy enemies with. It's that ability from control. It's awesome gunplay. Um, and it is the bullet hell attack patterns of Returnal mixed with the destruction of the game called the finals.

It has all that destruction. But the coolest part for me about Void Breaker is it's not just you're not destroying things just because it's cool and and it looks awesome. It's how you weaken the enemies quicker. It's how the the their shields break and I think the sound design is freaking fantastic whenever you that there's such a cool feeling of seeing a horde of enemies coming to you knowing you have a gigantic platform floated above you.

But the reason I recommend it for for this show especially because it has local co-op, local couch co-op, and it seems like such a cool game to have be like baby's first beat him up like because of the way that it does not only character creation but also character customization, getting new loot, having these kind of fun boss fights, and also bless the I think they were mentioning that the they have a lot of devs on the combat team that were from the the Killer Instinct",

I I don't think it look but this is more for people I would say that whenever they go, man, I need a game to play with my kid that isn't like overly violent or whatever. I think this is something that because it is local couch co-op, it's something that a I could totally see a family just like go four player co-op or whatever and um having these cool moments with beating the bosses, going back to the hub world, buying new loot or whatever.

There's another one though. I'll say bad title for the game. Yeah, I agree. Tower very much invokes like either tower defense or you're building a thing.
