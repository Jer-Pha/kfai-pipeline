Bungie also confirmed uh that the game will be a quote unquote premium product, though the studio has yet to confirm the price. Now, speaking on the Friends Per Second podcast, director Joe Ziggler has explained why Bungie's Marathon won't launch as a free-to-play title. quote, \"We are hoping uh that what we're showing is exciting enough that someone is going to take the leap with us, but we are also committed to delivering on seasons past that on seasons past this that will continuously offer uh to evolve the game without an increase to the box price.\" He said, \"What we're hoping everyone understands about the game is that we're focused on",

This price point could would bring it in line with Hell Divers 2 and the now defunct Concord. So there there's a lot here, right? Like because the assuming it should be free to play, I do think is based on just looking around at similar games and what's happened to them in the last couple years. Uh on top of that, I will say uh other gut reactions, I totally forgot that this was also coming to Xbox. So seeing that news, I I was like, \"Hey, good for them. This is",

And it's like, man, I look at that and like I know that I am just a specific type of gamer, but there are many of me and I want to play a single player Bungie marathon game that looks like that. Cool. I'm not getting that, but it's still a paid title. That to me kind of reads a little bit weird. You games cost money. There has to be a price. Yep.

Of course, throughout the internet, there was a bunch of creators that got to go play this. Like we said, Paris, uh, the one that spoke to me, uh, was Skill Up. Skillup's Blue Sky reads, \"Bunie's Marathon shows great promise, but it's still missing something at the very core of its extraction gameplay loop, making it difficult to predict how Marathon will launch or where it might one day end up.\" Of course, Mskeilla has hands-on impressions up on the YouTube.

Bungie has earned its reputation for mastering the live service model over the past decade of Destiny and shows no signs of letting players down here as they told me they already have plans to support Marathon with new maps, weapons, characters, and more as they develop it.

I always forget. Uh, said in a statement Friday, quote, \"To all our fans, uh, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning.

That's another episode of Kind of Funny Games Daily in the bank. But remember, we're a small business all about live talk shows. That means from here we're rolling into the kind of funny games cast where the one, the only, the best voice in the business, Paris Lily, is joining Blessing, Andy, and Mike Wright to talk about Marathon. He played it, what he thought about it, what those boys think about it, what they think this extraction shooter needs. Uh, after that, we'll be doing our screencast review of the premiere of The Last of Us season 2, and then streaming video games thanks to Nvidia. Uh, if you are watching later or listening later, remember you can get all of that on youtube.com/kindfunname.s. You could watch this recorded live on YouTube and of course twitch.tv/kindfunny games. You can get most of it as a podcast series. You",

I'm not using I'm breaking my own rules, you know, but there's just so much minutes late to the games cast. Like second best baby blues in San Francisco. More like first poopiest butt fart land.
