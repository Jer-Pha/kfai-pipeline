It's the Jabroni boys snow bike. Mike, I mean, if you get the Jabroni boys together, Tim, that means we're talking about one thing. Firsterson shooters, baby. This is a anything shooter. Yeah. We also have Andy Cortez. Second person shooters as well. Yeah. And the producer/sucer Nick Garpier. How come there aren't second person shooters? You know, I just watch you play a game. Yeah, exactly. Mike's experience. You play Mike. All day I've heard you say a bunch of [\u00a0__\u00a0] cuz you're still Mike Mike and you you're just constantly Well, I had to I had to fill you in on my life, Tim. And I I appreciate it. Can we stop? Can we stop for one second? Can we stop for one second? Can you take one of those down? Just one. Just one. Just one. I need you to go 90s with it. Go. There it is. There it is.

Wednesday. No, nothing screams ' 90s more than uh one one overall on, one off with a Beyonce shirt. Skin tight Beyonce. It's a fun one because like I bought this way back in the day and I told the chat I was like I can't wear back in the day when you were in junior high way back in the day as I was like I can't wear this and they're like just wear a jacket over it and I was like I don't have a good jacket so I'll wear overalls over it. But of course Andy you're probably saying sto Mike why are you wearing a Beyonce t-shirt as Tim was going to get to and it's a great question. Of course, I have now joined the girly pop nation for Final Fantasy 10 2 and it was ladies night last night because it's all about Final Fantasy 10 2. What's the group name, Tim?

Nick, this thing starts off like a Spice Girls concert in the early 2000s. Bang. Dancing in. And now I'm thinking about trees. I'm thinking about the sky. We got to get back to shooters. I want to let you know why I'm having fun. I've heard you say ladies night no less than 15 times this morning with no context or anything. And the fact that the context is Final Fantasy 10 2 makes me so [\u00a0__\u00a0] happy. I know you'd love it, Tim. Uh I've gone through some heartbreak as well, but I won't get into that. We'll talk about it later on. I I hit something so hard and heavy, Andy, in that video game that it rocked me to my fundamental core.

So, is that what you're upset about that it should have been you or are you just such a Chapu fan that you're you're sad that that brother would do that? It should have been me, of course. It should have been all of us except for Waka. And then yeah, I'm a chop. I'm a ride or die Chapu fan to the point where I'd rather have Lulu poor sad and lonely than with Waka, right? So yeah, it's a tough one out there when you hear about the girl that you love having a baby with somebody you don't even know. You know what I mean? Like that's a tough one.

Mike sends me a two and a half minute video last night where like he just turns his phone on, starts talking to it as if he's doing a podcast, which I always appreciate the snow bike mic move. He's what's up Tim Getty's? I have this for and he tells me this whole story and on the Uber home last night. It's just me and G and I'm just like listening to this call and she's like what are you doing? And I'm like listening listening to Mike and she's just like what? I'm like he made this for me.

DMC 3. Oh, you beat DMC 3. We need to talk about that. This isn't the show, Mike. This isn't the show. This show is talking about extraction shooters. Y'all have played Arc Raiders. The embargo is up for that. So, we're going to talk about that. Marathon is the new hotness.

At 1:45, we're going to start our reaction to the state of play for Borderlands and then do the Games cast after that, talking about everything we see for Borderlands 4, which recently got pushed up, a rare release date move up situation. Interesting. Does it mean GTA 6 is coming this year, Andy? Yes or no? Do they have insider info? Uh, probably. It's I mean it's weird that like PlayStation's doing a state of play for a game that is not un like Marathon's coming out the I guess they moved it up but I don't know it's just it's really weird.

The whole week is dedicated and just me and Nick jumping into this extraction shooter. Will we like it? Will we love it? Will we hate it? Will we get good? We're going to find out this week. We're going to find out together. Uh, if you're a kind of funny member, today's Gregway will be a massive one, lasting the entire drive-in as Greg explains where the hell he's been the past two days.

Dad, you have one too many.\" Dad, isn't it exciting to think about like you're wrapping up the season here soon and then a new season will happen and then a new Stars in the Banks will happen.

Let's talk about is marathon or is extraction shooters hitting for us right now? Are we in or we out on them? I mean my answer is always yes. I like extraction shooters. The big the bigger question for me is what what will it take for them to endure in this office or just going forward I guess in the general populace. I think it's a really fun balance. I think it combines all the elements like in the genre in general combines all the elements that I like in while playing with my friends. There's goals, there's simple, it's the cycle itself, no",

Um, and there's a human element to it that I think you absolutely have to have because that adds a level of competition to these things that like something like a Destiny raid just never really hit for me cuz I'm like I don't love shooting bots. I do love the occa. I like that chaos of clashing with another team and then getting third party and then like you barely survive and all these things. I like knowing there's a really human on the other side that whose day I just ruined or who just who knows they ruined my day. So these are all like both of these were really really fun.

Let's get to the topic of the show. Starts, stats, stats. I appreciate you jumping in so quickly, Nick, but I want a little refresher and I want you to answer a question that I've asked you all before, but I want to hear it again. What is an extraction shooter? An extraction shooter is a video game um that you interact with on a computer screen. Mhm. You and your friends gather together or you can hop in solo and it's usually a largeish map that you go explore because your main missions. You're always working for a faction. There's always there's always somebody. There's",

There's always there's always somebody. There's always somebody in this like dilapidated world that you exist in that says, \"Hey, I need five [\u00a0__\u00a0] cans of beans and three gears of whatever and you know, two armor plating or whatever. So go find those. we'll give you a lot of money. Go find those things. Bring it back. We'll reward you. Right? And you select that. You say, \"I will select that contract.\" You select it and you embark on this world. No pun intended. Embark is a studio that made is making Arc Raiders who also makes the finals. And then you go embark on this world. And you and your homies go out there and then you go, \"Oh, the those little parts are usually in this area of the map. Let me go there. But watch out. There's other players out there. There's other there's another an extra threat that's not just the NPC enemies",

There's other there's another an extra threat that's not just the NPC enemies that vary across different difficulties depending on the game that you're playing. Some spots you're like, \"Ooh, really good loot in there.\" But we know that it's going to be hot because there's good loot and other teams are really going to gravitate towards that little spot on the map. And it's also going to be extra difficult because the game also put in harder NPCs and harder computer enemies there that are going to really challenge us. If there's not already another team challenging us as well, you hope to get those things. If you die, you're you you die, you die. You lose your [\u00a0__\u00a0] Dead, you're dead.

You lose your [\u00a0__\u00a0] and your run is done and then you're either super sad and you you hit alt f4 and you get real sad and you quit out the game. Uh, but yeah, I think Extraction Shooters are in sort of a a weird spot, right, Mike? Cuz like I think Escape from Tarov is kind of like the big main one. And then the more casual audience who isn't PC gaming cuz it it Escape from Darov requires you to like go to a website and sign up for Yeah. You can't get it through Steam. I'm pretty sure Mike and I belong to the Russian model. I've given up my credit card information, Tim. So, a lot.

The The Division Dark Zone is kind of the main thing that a lot of more casual audiences know cuz The Division Dark Zone was a mode within the Division video game, which is a PvE game, but the Dark Zone is like you can hop in there to go get loot, but you might also encounter other players that really want that loot as well. Who's going to be able to extract the quickest? And then we've sort of seen a lot of different extraction games pop up. Remember, Call of Duty had their own. They tried to make that, you know, popular to the masses as well with DMZ. Yeah, they tried. Um, I have some questions. Yeah. You're you're saying that you and your squad, you get the contract, you're going out to to get all the things that they want, and there are other human characters or players stop you. Are there other missions to stop you or are there other missions to get other extract other things? There might be a little side mission",

There's always different contracts and missions that people are on. Now, this is where prox chat comes in. Yeah. Because when we were playing the cycle, there would be multiple times where you'd come across one person. You'd be like, \"Look, you can't it's it's hard to get that's one of the the the downsides to to shooters like this. It's hard to get to your friends sometimes to to hop in with you midday or whatever if you're just grinding.\" So, you hop in by yourself, right?

Yeah. And that's like it. So like the biggest question that a lot you know we had that super chat asking about prox chat and arc raiders has prox chat. Arc raiders will allow you to sort of live out those really improvisational cool moments with another player that I got to experience when I play the cycle where most of the time you're going to run into a [\u00a0__\u00a0] who's going to want to kill you and take your stuff because that's part of the thrill of running",

Yeah, I'm trying to do that, too.\" And then we just kind of became homies and we're just on this run like looting together. We're just chatting. I'm not even streaming. I'm just like, this is kind of this is a cool sort of thing. And then we hear gunshots and we're like, oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] there's another there's another team here.

And maybe it was like the third time that we played it, the final time that we played it, because Michael's like, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] we're playing on the nighttime map.\" And I felt the need to be way more stealthy and sneaky. And you hear shots ringing out in the distance and you're like, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] squads over here.

We were creeping in the dark. We were like, \"Where's the squad at?\" They're at the bottom of the elevator. There was just it I It felt great. It It felt exciting and and full attention.

I like Arc Raiders for the setting.

I like lots of elevation here too. I liked Dark Raiders for the setting. Uh I also liked Dark Raider for the vibes, right? And I think there's just like a cool theme of like this robotic world meeting this post-apocalyptic world and you're kind of blending the two together.

Nothing different on the mission structure wise. I appreciated the presentation a lot more than Marathon though. And Marathon is already kind of hinted that they may want to introduce a hub world. So when we play the cycle frontier, which got shut down recently, uh the cycle frontier when you'd finish a run, you'd go back to your home world and or to your hub world rather, and you would see your other home like other homies kind of running around going to accept missions from different NPCs and stuff.

That's how big the map feels and how much room you kind of have to play cat and mouse with, but you could bang into a team.

What are your your strong points and your weaknesses in either Arc Raiders? The big drive for me right now in Arc Raiders is the setting that we've talked about with the visuals and the look and the style. I've really enjoyed I've actually not liked or connected with the weapons whatsoever in Arc Raiders. The very slower game, right? Feels like The Last of Us with the singleshot sniper rifle, the 10shot automatic uh rifle. I I haven't dug that, right?

Let me drop this for you.\" And so, I like the upgrades so far on both of these games finding them. I haven't found much in Arc Raiders to upgrade my guns. I never felt like we had that. I found one yellow sniper rifle. We lost it the next round, so I never really got to see it in action. But like I never felt like I was finding, hey, here's a scope for this gun or here's this gun's larger ammo round, right? As a marathon, I felt like I was finding that stuff.

Get in there. Like, let's try to get another run in or whatever. Um, but when it comes to the weapons, yeah, I think the initial kind of weapons you find in Arc Raiders may feel a bit overwhelming or underwhelming because you're also you're essentially just shooting at steel robots and drones. So like when I I I always kind of make the comparison of why I always felt Battlefront Star Wars Battlefront was always underwhelming because shooting a laser just doesn't feel as cool as like hit a bullet like pop, you know, that hard impact.

In Arc Raiders. That's interesting. I had the opposite feeling. I actually really liked the mechanics of shooting like just the little drones in the air and how they reacted to your bullets and they would like shift and and that that felt really organic trying to find the weak spot on like the larger spider enemy when it would open up and you'd get inside the I guess I'm thinking more of just the audio feedback but I love how in Arcadus you can shoot the individual propellers on these drones and it will if you break like that one propeller it'll and kind of like [\u00a0__\u00a0] up or whatever.

I'm not running 12 feet and then getting tired. I enjoyed seeing that progression. uh in addition to albeit how you know it is very very limited but the having a character creator and that's also another big disappointment I have with marathon with marathon you the lore is that you are a consciousness that is being put into a weaved like body exo suit right so you're just kind of like a mind being put into any sort of body doesn't matter like citizen sleeper yeah kind of it doesn't matter if it looks male or female whatever like you're just kind of being put into any body you want.

Uh the way Exoborn is it's also a character creator, but the classes are dependent on what exo suit you are equipping. So, if you want to be the more tanky sort of exo suit, you put on the tankier exo suit. Where in Marathon, it's like you feel like you have less agency. And I think they want to have added agency by doing customization and getting cosmetics and getting a cool new helmet, cool new color scheme, whatever it may be.

The reasoning was we'd rather create content for the game that is for the betterment of the game and not to help sustain the company like free to like we'd rather us be able to make [\u00a0__\u00a0] that makes the game better as opposed to like makes the company money to like oh we need to put on a new cosmetic to make more money. And I guess at the end of the day, it's like, oh man, this this could have been a looter shooter with a PvP component and I would have like lost my [\u00a0__\u00a0] about that cuz you could still have the people like Nick that want the thrill of that. Or you could have the people like me that can momentarily to hop in to the PvP section but",

And who knows what that experience is going to be like, but I'm stoked to see what they cook up because a lot of these big robot enemies and arc raiders are super sick. They look awesome. They're scary. They're these big like they they get gigantic at some points where they're just massive spider walkers around the world. I mean, we're also in this uh day and age where hell divers last year just took over the entire planet and that is strictly PvE shooter like you wanted, right? Now companies are going, well, maybe we back off the PVP situation and extraction shooters. we make something like this, right? And so they're constantly in flux.

Like the business decision of now you weigh out the freeto play. Yeah. get more people in here. We hope to make some money on cosmetics or hey, we need this $40 price tag cuz whatever we do get in here is at least giving us the money that we can make back and put forward into it because if we go full freeto play and nobody wants to play this, we've lost it all.

Um I mean Yeah, I think it's like everything else where you just buy our coin or whatever it is. I think it all depends on I think your question, Mike, is all depends on how good and viable the finals is. Yeah. You know, the finals the game. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

First off, I want to give a congrats to Ravelord Nito, who says uh just Brave Lord Neato from Dark Souls 1. Oh, my bad, Andy. And and Mr. Neato, uh just accepted an internship at a game company for this summer as a programmer. Congratulations. Have fun. Hell yes. Uh and then Demon and Hacker has the last super chat of the day here, saying, uh survival, Arc, and V Rising versus Extraction. Which do the three of you prefer? Survival. Yeah, Andy likes survival games. I'm a survi. Yeah. Like if I had to choose, I'd have a more sort of zen-like experience and win.

I I all going in, looting, all that stuff, that's that's interesting for 5 seconds to me.

If that's the case, I have such an interesting thin line where I'm like, it's either ultra competitive or it needs to be a standalone single player story that I can just immerse myself in and not have to worry about anyone else. Give him Cyberpunk. I'm still playing Cyberpunk. Hell yeah. It's great. It's still great. I still just jump in every once in a while because I like to exist in that world on my own timeline, take the story or the side quests as I want to take them and not have to worry about that. And it's so weird and antithetical to what I just said about like dropping into war zone, but like there's so much energy that has to go into even getting your friends together to play a an extraction shooter that sometimes you got to just sit and it's midnight and you guys fire this up and hear Kiana Reeves",

Everybody be quiet. They can hear us, right? You know, we get a lot of that. What do we live in? We live in a silent society, Baron. And that's where it is.

We've done it with Lethal Company and other games where it's like everybody go in your own room, turn on the prox chat, and the moment that you can't hear someone, you get that fear, right? And then the moment they come back, you laugh and giggle when they're running away from something. And the same goes for extraction shooters of why that is so cool and what Call of Duty did with the death c or defs and all that of like you love hearing other people talking and you can be strategic of like, \"Everybody be quiet. we can hear them like let's creep up on them or you know they can hear you and come after them.
