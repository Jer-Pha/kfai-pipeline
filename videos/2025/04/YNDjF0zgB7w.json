Toys for Bob said it would love to work on Banjo. In an interview with content creator Canadian Guy, uh Toys for Bob studio head Paul Yan was asked which developers or IP would the studio love to work on? I think it's and this is not a joke. I think it's Canadian guy. Yeah. Yeah. You said eh like it was like eh. Yeah. But it's more like you know, you know what I mean? That's what they do up there. That's what they do up there. That's That's their work. That's their word. But like if I say I'm a bad guy. Yeah, we can't take that. That's theirs. There's so many. Sorry. This is why this is why we make jokes. Quote, \"There's so many.\" And that's one of the exciting possibilities of being independent. Uh said Yan. One company we'd like to work with that we're already working with, Team Xbox.

One company we'd like to work with that we're already working with, Team Xbox. They've been a great partner. They also have a very interesting roster of characters that Toys for Bob could have a lot of fun with. The Honey Bear is the first one that comes to mind. I think we can all agree Banjo's been hibernating long enough, right? The rare owned platformer hasn't seen an installment since Banjo Kazoui: Nuts and Bolts, which was released on 360 15 years ago. No, honestly, that doesn't sound long enough. Really? Yeah, Nuts and Bolts sounds like a different generation ago. Like five generations ago, man. In 2020, Spencer said that any revival of classic Rare franchises were up to Rare itself. However, speaking to VGC this summer, as part of an extended interview to mark Badger's 25th anniversary, a group of original Rare team members said they weren't expecting a new game anytime soon.",

Cool. I mean, this is like it is fun that they're actually saying it. You know what I mean? Like to have Toys for Rob straight up say Banjo's name. It's like, all right, I don't think it necessarily means anything, but it also doesn't not mean something. Tony Hawk 3 and four are coming out in a couple months plus. Anything is possible. uh Activision's IPs, Microsoft's IPs, any way you want to look at it now, there's so many of them. I think all options are on the table and we're still in that state of chaos, I think, of the acquisitions still not being like fully like figured out in terms of like who's working on what and who falls under who and all that stuff.

What do you What do you think they're working on currently, Toys for Bob? Spyro. I mean, that's the thing is I I Spyro 4 would have been my bet. They were working on a Crash 5 and then that got canned at some point. So, I don't know. Like, I'd be I'm just excited for whatever Toys for Bob's working on.

People love it. It's great, right? And you're trying to figure out what you're doing next and you're now independent. you have access to these Xbox IPs. What are the IPs or what are the games you pick from a business standpoint? I mean, it's just pure business. It's Crash Bandicoot. Oh, before a a new banjo. I I think a Crash outsells Banjo. Oh, I I I know that hurts for people to hear. I just I just think it's a numbers game. Having said that, they've done Crash recently, so I can I can see them not wanting to over rely on it.

But I I think that in terms of IP value, in terms of like Xbox value, Banjo's the move just because it's like goodwill bringing something back that's exciting.

And like maybe Crash is a bit more mainstream than Banjo, but I think there is like just the sense of Banjo's been gone forever. We've not gotten a traditional Banjo game since Banjo Tuili in like 2000 or some [\u00a0__\u00a0] right? Like I feel like a new Banjo in 2025, 2026 has the potential to like it does take over. I also think that uh the expectations for Banjo are going to be way higher and way more difficult to to meet than a Crash. A Crash 4 came out and I'd say more",

Cuz I feel like so many people a Crash Fant sucks and like oh this game's actually good. Yeah. You know, whereas like Banjo I think it's like oh we're talking about nostalgia goggles. These are some of the best games of all time. Right. Mhm. Following up on that is a a much tougher cell. I agree with that. Yeah. I think just for the nature of the kind of platformer it is, I think Crash when you're talking about making a new Crash game, right? Like there's more linearity there, right? Like I think Crash is a bit more dialed in as far as what you can do with a new Crash nowadays, whereas Banjo, you're almost going up against a Mario Odyssey.

And uh we didn't talk about Spyro, but I also think Spyro has a lot of juice in it as well. I think Spyro out of those three, I think Spyro might be on might be at the bottom of the list. I see. I don't know because I I think specifically for Toys for Bob, yeah, I think Spyro makes the most sense and Spyro is the one that I think has earned the the follow-up sequel from Toys for Bob the most. Um I think Toys for Bob did the Spyro Reignited Trilogy. I want to say yes. I I always Bobs will correct me here, but like I always get it wrong of like which of the studios did what. Yeah.

Uh Riley says Toys for Bob and the Conquer IP. I feel like we got to get B before we get Conquer. I I don't think they'll be right for Conquer. I forget. I had an idea for Conquer and I I forgot what it was. I'll think on it though. There's like a There is a developer that is right for Conquer that we've mentioned before on this show.

It's a console that doesn't sell games, unfortunately. I while that is true for a lot of things, I do think Hell Divers is the type of game that could sell on an Xbox. Yeah, I agree. multiplayer shooter games. Those should be everywhere. That's just how this goes, man. We need the community.
