And number one video game journalist in the world, Bloomberg's Jason Shrier. How you doing, Jason? That is offensive to Andy. I Yeah, listen. He's not here. You know what I mean? He's not hanging out with us. So, whoever's in the room first, number one. But if you guys are both on a podcast together, then we have to figure it out. We have to break the pool number. We have to break the pool queue and we you guys are fight. How you doing, Jason? How you doing? One of us can be one and the other one can be a Oh, I like that. I like that compromise right there. Compromise that. This isn't This is an exciting one. Uh, Blueprints has been in the air. It's a It's an indie game that kind of has been bubbling in the background.

Uh you you've been kind of hinting towards your thoughts and then today embargo went up and it's it seems like a game of the year contender. Seems like a game of the generation contender. So, I'm excited to talk about that.

We never get this level of depth from developers, so don't miss it if you want to know how games really get made and keep going. This is awesome one. Uh I had the pleasure of editing some of it. And from what I've heard and talking to the developers themselves, like this is an exciting one. And as somebody who has never played Elder Scrolls, they really go deep. And it's interesting to hear like the background of like the highs and the lows. Uh and they're very candid about it. So look forward to that on Friday.

Um, I got I think on day one of us having the code, uh, Greg Miller text me and he's like, \"Bloops is your type of shit.\" Yeah. And I and I thought it was just a first person puzzle game cuz if you know me, first-p person puzzle games are my [\u00a0__\u00a0] You know, I love a manifold garden. I love an anti-chamber. I love the witness. I love games where it is just like walk around an environment and just put together the pieces of how everything works and figure out the puzzles, right?

Um, the twist to it is that when you enter the manor, you have three doors that you can enter and every room you enter is randomized and you draft what room you're going to go into. So, you're giving you're given three choices uh of rooms. You pick one and then you just kind of keep going with that, right? Some rooms might have one door and so you go out that door and pick another choice of whatever three rooms, but you keep going. Um, on top of that, there is a step system where uh, every single time you enter a room, you go down a step, right? And so, you start off with 50 steps. Every time you enter or exit a room, you lose a step. And so, when you lose all your steps, you get too tired and",

And it's a rogike structure where you uh uh finish your day, you go back the next day, and uh, the house is starting from scratch. you then start drafting rooms again. Um, it is a puzzle game, like a first-person puzzle game, rogike slashdrafting game that is like taking these different elements of game design, putting them into one thing. And when I tell you that I'm [\u00a0__\u00a0] obsessed with it. Uh, I'll pass to Jason in a second, but to give you my quick impressions, I've played about 16 hours of this game and it is not enough.

I feel like I'm almost there, but even I think when we talked to Jason, right, like after I beat this game, I'm not done with this game. After I roll credits with this game, there's still I can still feel that there's so much for me to explore, look into, figure out. Um, but yeah, like I've only gotten to play 16 Hours cuz we had South at Midnight Review. We had the Nintendo NYC thing that we did. We had uh uh I think even First Berserker, I was still playing it.

On the kind of funny review score, the patented uh kind of funny review scale. This is super tentative cuz like I feel like once I actually beat the game, my score could very much very well go up. Right now I'm at a 9 out of 10. Wow. Uh it go up. Oh yeah. Wow. There's no way it's going down. Like that's the thing is this game is so my [\u00a0__\u00a0] and I'm so obsessed with it and I think it does everything that it's doing so well, but there's still so much for me to uncover.

But I just want to hear your general impressions and also like let's just start off with the number that I want to hear cuz I've heard it before. How many hours do you have in this game? Yeah, so it's fun hearing Blessing talking about finishing the game. Um I have 141.5 hours. Um a lot of that. Okay, a couple things about that number. First of all, so I rolled credits at like 17 hours. So around around where you are, blessing, you probably have the credits the credits in sight. Literally, I can see the vision of like what I need to do to roll credits. Um I think when you when you roll credits, uh you will find yourself like, \"Okay, cool. I I achieve this objective of getting to room 46.\"",

I I achieve this objective of getting to room 46.\" Cuz that's that's the objective, right? like you're trying to get to this room that seems unattainable and um because of the the story is essentially that the stipulation of your great uncle's will is that if you reach this room that seems unattainable, you will inherit the entire manor and become the new baron of Mount Holly's manor. That is the name of this this estate with its evershifting rooms. Um and so you you hit that point and you're like, \"Okay, this feels like a satisfying ending, but wait a minute, there are a few things that I'm still trying to figure out.\" out and then you might poke something here and find something here and then you might discover, oh my god, there's an entire new mystery surrounding this thing and then there's another another mystery around this thing.

Um, and I think that something it's worth saying, I haven't really articulated this elsewhere, but I think something it's worth saying is that this is a a very heavy story game. And it's kind of like the story, a lot of the story is hidden and you have to really kind of put the pieces together yourself and investigate it and become this um little amateur policeman investigator uh going around and reading books and letters and diaries and trying to figure out um the story of all these different generations of people who have lived in this house or occupied this house in some way. And that is really like one of the most appealing parts of this game is really diving into that.

Would you do you feel comfortable giving it a score on our kind of funny review scale? Oh yeah. I mean, come on. This is one of the best games I've ever played in my life. Like I I just I want to be clear about that. Like there have been these periods of my life. So, I've I've I've been very privileged over the course of my career to been have been getting early codes of games and being able to play games early for a very long time now. And occasionally, you'll have this moment um where like you're playing something and you start texting with some other people who are maybe playing early copies and maybe trying to be like like try to kind of um uh let your thoughts materialize, crystallize a little bit in your head, and you'll be like, \"Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] like this is",

It happened to me with um Elden Ring. Uh it's happened to me with a a couple other games over the years. Um and this is one of those games. This is like an alltime great. So obviously it's a 10 out of 10. Like I don't really think uh I saw a funny Reddit comment uh earlier today cuz all the reviews went up this morning. I saw a Reddit comment from someone uh and no no shade on him. I just thought this was funny. Who was like, \"This is one of the greatest games I've ever played. 90 out of 100red.\" And I thought that was pretty funny. But yeah, this is this is truly a masterpiece.

And like this is actually a narrative game is where I'm like I think my score is going to go up over time because I didn't really start caring about the game narratively until maybe my last four hours of gameplay, right? Like I very much was looking at it as background stuff cuz to Jason's point, it is very hidden and it is very obscure when you're reading a thing and it feels like you're just reading nonsense because you don't really have much of a grip of what is going on in the world, what is going on in like the family tree, who these people are. Um, and it feels like background dressing until you realize that it's not. It feels like I'm 11 hours into the game, like super early on. Like I haven't even gotten past the first main area that",

Uh so yeah, all the story stuff that's there, I'm like I'm looking through it trying to find answers to puzzles, but I'm not looking at it as a story yet. So that's that's interesting to hear that it's such a story game. Yes. And I'm fascinated to hear what Barrett has to say because Barrett texted me over the weekend again adding to my FOMO that he beat the game. Of course. Barrett, what do you think? Uh, as someone who is not a puzzle poppy as we uh describe here, uh, I like puzzles in games. I like puzzle games. I don't really gravitate towards them. I echo everything Jason has said.

Um I yeah, I think this this is a 10 out of 10 masterpiece. And I think that might be the first time I'm saying that on our new review scale. Um, there's so many moments that like the the other thing that like really stood out to me is how many Christmas morning moments this has where you put something together and then the solution you think is going to happen is like 10 rooms away and the anticipation of like walking back and putting something together and then like you get to unwrap the present of like, \"Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] I solved it.\" And it's not just a like,",

And I I think that mixed with the rogike nature of it uh mixed with the story that I think is Yeah. At first definitely feels very like here's a way to deliver you puzzles, but then you start putting together the more like indications of what has happened to this family. All of that mixed together, I think, is superbly done for someone who doesn't gravitate towards this genre. Um, and so for those out there who might be hesitant to try this game because they haven't they didn't gravitate towards The Witness or they didn't gravitate towards uh The Outer Wilds.

I think you bringing up the witness and then also talking about the Christmas morning feel, right? Like one of the things that has hit for me while playing this game on a little bit of like I guess a macro level of the way how well and how interestingly it's designed is it I'll hit a wall on a thing but have so many more options of things to do.

Coins you can spend on things. Uh gems help you uh unlock certain types of rooms that are a bit more of like the rarer rooms or a bit more of like the more useful rooms.

If I draft this, I'm I know I'm going to get a shovel or I know I'm going to be able to like dig dig up holes or whatever it is, right? Oh, this is a hallway and so it has many exits.

Um, and so there's this like real-time effect of all right, I have this like laid out on paper puzzle that I'm solving of how to get to this place, but then at the same time I'm actually doing real exploration in these in in these spaces and I'm finding surprises and I'm finding terminals and I'm finding different things. Um, and to bring it back to the witness thing, right, like of always having something to do, there would be plenty of times as I'm playing this game where I there was a it was such a good mystery, right, where I put together this mystery that I've been trying to figure out for 25 days of this game because this game is like divided up into days.

And so I start playing as and as I'm going I am like I'm looking for spec I'm looking specifically for a shovel, but I am like finding other things where I'm like, \"Oh man, I really want to pull on thread A, but thread B is not calling my name because I am like I am I'm on the way to to to room 46.\" Like I am like, you know, barreling towards my ultimate objective. And like it's a thing of it gives you so many so many different things to pull on, so many different puzzles to solve at the same time. Um, I don't know if that makes sense. Like that brings me back to the witness kind of thing of the witness does the same thing of, \"All right, I hit a block",

Oh man, this reminds me of this thing. I'm going to go solve it over here.\" It is really satisfying to the brain. Yeah. Jason, what was it that to let me let me expand on that a little bit to try to kind of frame it for people. I think maybe the best way to think about how this game actually works and function is that you have to think about it on different layers. So on one layer is the room drafting the blessing was talking about where you have to think about your layout of the room and you have to make sure you're not getting any deadends and also you're not going to get stuck over here. You're going to have enough keys to make it all the way over here. Um you have enough gems you can draft the highowered rooms you might",

Um you have enough gems you can draft the highowered rooms you might need over here. And then on top of that you also have all of these little other goals that you are thinking about as you go. So let me give some concrete examples of that. Right? So there's a room called the billiard room that you can draft pretty early. And in the billiard room, as you're exploring it, you'll notice that there's this dart board. And in the start board, there are a bunch of different colors and you're kind of you look at it and maybe you can interact with it. And the first time you see it, you're like, \"What is this? I have no idea.\" Okay. Then you kind of file that away in the back of your head. Maybe 20 minutes later, you get to another room where you find a piece of paper and it has a little diagram in the corner that kind of looks like the billiard room. And then you",

And then you get the magnifying glass from somewhere else. You bring it to that room with a piece of paper. Use a magnifying glass on it. And then you see that it's explaining what to do with that dart board in the billiard room. So now you file that away too. And then now you know as you're going through this drafting process, maybe this time, maybe the next day, maybe in a future day, you know, okay, now I know next time I go to the billiard room, I know how to play around with that puzzle and interact with it better. So, think of it as kind of like um this room drafting rogike where in every room you are just kind of accumulating information and then using that to interact with in other rooms to solve just uh hundreds and hundreds of puzzles both big and small.

And then the smaller ones are like how do I get into this billyard? Another good example is like there's a boiler room that you'll find pretty early in the game and the boiler room um can provide electricity to things and then you'll start to realize that some rooms actually need electricity to be used. And then as you're going through your room drafting process, you'll also be filing away in the back of your head, oh, okay, I want to draft a boiler room and I want to put it I want to connect it in some way to this other room that requires power because that will help me solve a puzzle over here.

Everything seems frozen. How do I get out of how do I how do I um find all the mysteries in here?\" um you could just file that away and not worry about it for like two more hours and do other stuff.

Like you'll find hints just sp like uh sprawled out throughout the entire mansion um that'll lead you down all sorts of different rabbit holes. And the rabbit holes get deeper and deeper the more you play. And like like I said before, like by the time you've reached room 46 and rolled credits, you'll still have in your notebook so many different tasks and goals and things you want to learn about or see more of that like it's really I I I will be surprised if many people stop after rolling credits because there's just so much to do and it is so eternally satisfying.

Like it is such a delight to play through this entire thing.

But um most of the game you can do all by yourself and it is just so constantly satisfying uh that it's just a pleasure to play. Uh yeah, I just wanted to add like uh Jason uh kind of breaking down the puzzles. very much feels like um escape room type of things and like how things are laid out and like subtly clued into you and like trying to or you know um guide you to certain things and how you're putting things together. It feels very escape roomy in in that aspect. Also, Jason, it's funny that you mentioned the boil of the room uh being something you get early on.

So, I was like, ah, here's this thing that I've like other rooms have mentioned so many [\u00a0__\u00a0] times. I have not gotten it yet. And so there again there's that fun aspect to it of as well of like the rogike kind of more random nature to it which I think sometimes felt conflicting and frustrating but for the most part I was surprised at how well um it did kind of gel together. Uh cuz I think when you try to put together a rogue light with uh puzzle uh elements that are very escape roomesque it's like how does how does that work? And it's surprising how well it's pulled off here. Yeah. So, there are a couple reasons that work, I think. One is that I mean, you you said it yourself.",

So, like the fact that there's so many different paths to accomplish all these goals, I think helps make the RNG and the randomness of it all feel less frustrating. The other thing is the more you play, the more abilities you will get um in all sorts of different ways to manipulate the RNG and like only be able to draft or like make make some of the rooms you want more common, make some of the rooms you don't want less common. You can play around with that in all sorts of different ways um as you go through the game. There's a room called the study, for example, that lets you use gems to reroll rooms. And so you can really just like keep r-rolling as long as you can find gems. And so there are a lot of kind of tips and and tricks like",

So, like the best way to make it through like the the way you make it through the game is by learning things and understanding things the way you do in Outer Wilds where like if you know Outer Wilds, you finish it and you have to finish it in under 18 minutes. That's how you beat the game. And this is similar to that. There is a little bit more of mechanical stuff that just kind of carries on through.

Yeah. And I think this is one where I, as we're talking about it, I think a lot of people will be like, \"Oh, this is a big brain game. Like, you're going to need a lot of knowledge to to play this thing.\" I think the game does a really good job of the more you pick it pick it away pick away at it the more it'll give you in terms of trying to figure out what is what is going on with the thing right like I think a good example would be uh uh last week right as me and bear are having water cooler conversations about it Barrett's",

Um and that was like a cool first puzzle to solve for me. How about you? How about you Jason? Yeah, I think it's some story stuff.

So, like during the the review process for a lot of Steam games, uh cloud saves aren't turned on yet. And so, I started playing it. I played like the first two hours on my work computer and then realized that cloud saves didn't work. And so, I was like, I'm going to start this over. Like, I think this is going to be worth me starting over. And so, I started over my Steam Deck, played about uh 14 hours on my Steam Deck, and it works pretty well.

There should be a way to just suspend it um and come back to it. Even if they don't want you to be able to save in the middle of runs, which I understand, there should be a suspend button, which hopefully will get patched in. That's one of the things with Steam Deck that was a benefit to where I can just put my Steam Deck on sleep mode and then come back to it later. But then also, I'm sure this would be optimized more over time where I'll turn the game back on and it that's where like it would be a bit more fraudy.

One of them uh being that there are Jason alluded to this earlier that there are permanent things that you can like unlock slash like things that you can do uh during the game that it's like all right cool that's set now. Some of those things aren't communicated like some of them are like if you pick up an item where it's actually I don't even know if there's permanent items if a lot of the things are communicated.

I there are strategies that like kind of unlock in your brain as you play of all right I'm not going to draft this room earlier because this is this room has a lot of exits so I'm going to save it to when I get further up or oh man this dead end room is really useful for the items that are in it and so I'm going to build out in a way to where I'm putting that dead end room in like a corner or something. Um, so I think that's the methodology by how they design it. But I still run into so many things where I'm like, \"Fuck, man.\" Like, there's nothing I could do about that. Come on. Come on.

I think uh that's inevitable with a game like this. And you definitely I mean there are definitely moments when you might feel like oh my god I I'm making no progress. But a lot of times you are making progress. It's just knowledge progress. And a lot of times um even when you feel like oh man I have such a good layout here.

So, uh, again, that if you keep in mind the entire time that like as long as you gain knowledge on a run, it doesn't matter that it ended prematurely, that I think is a helpful way of of kind of approaching the game in the early stages of it. I like that. Yeah. Uh, Charlie in the chat says, \"How's the music/ atmosphere big for me in these kinds of games?\" Amazing. Yeah, I agree. 10 out of 10.

Again, there's some like really late highlevel stuff that I think you might need some collaboration with other people on it, but there's nothing quite like the just like nesting logic puzzles of like some endgame Baba's you stuff.

I've leveled up and so I really do want to go back to Baba Zu, but I think the difference is that Baba is you like the puzzles are like these programming puzzles, right? Like that is a type of puzzle. Uh uh blueprints has a lot of different kinds of puzzles, right?
