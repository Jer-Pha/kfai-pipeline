Do you think Nintendo played it too safe with the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know. YouTube.com/kindfunny games to be part of this story. For me, for me, for me, for me, I like that though. I It's like wrong, but it's like good. Former Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida was recently asked for his thoughts on the Nintendo Switch 2's reveal. And his response was dot dot dot well not entirely exuberant. This comes from Easy Allies which recently interviewed Shu Yosha about among other things his reaction to the Switch 2 reveal. Here's his response in full when asked about it. Quote, \"To me it was a bit of a mixed message from Nintendo. In a sense, I think Nintendo is losing their identity in my opinion.

For me, they are always about creating some new experience, like designing hardware and games together to create something that is an amazing new experience. But Switch 2 uh as we all anticipated is a better Switch, right? It's the larger screen, the more powerful processor, higher resolution, 4K 120 frames per second, and uh they even have a hardware person starting their stream like other platforms do, right? And because it's a better Switch, the core promise, I'm sorry, the core premise of the whole Switch 2 is, you know, quote, \"We made things better.\" Uh, and that's something other companies have been doing all the time. End quote. Yosha went on to talk about how if you only game on Nintendo hardware, the Switch 2 is great because it lets you play games like Elden Ring that haven't been available before.

That looks amazing. They did a great job announcing that there end quote. Yoshida also praised uh Dragon Drive uh for being quote unquote very Nintendo.

We can still have third party stuff in there for the people who want that or just want, as we all know, their g re their real games on the go, but Nintendo's bread and butter is being Nintendo first party. And so, they're still going to do that. And I do expect those games to use these things and make the WDs and lead to the next Labo, which you've seen people do cool stuff with, sure, but like we didn't see Labo sell. We didn't see Labo become this runaway success thing. like you still got your amiibo reader in there, so that opens up the door to some weird ass [\u00a0__\u00a0] they want to do with that.

But I again I'll be interested to see how I mean there's a big Borderlands fan base, I guess, period. Just in the statement. But I how that's going to compare to Borderlands 3 and how Borderlands 3 would have compared to Monster of the Wilds if we're talking about like, you know, not life to date. Obviously, you know what? This is what I'm going to do. I'm going to look up sales for Borderlands 3 and then I'm going to look up sales for Bord for Monster Hunter World. I like that a lot. Uh while you do that, Kevin, I'm going to ask you to go to assets, pull this up. Uh as everybody knows, I am a Monster Hunter fanatic. Uh both in Wilds and World, I'm sorry, and now uh the now is the mobile version. Uh today with their spring update, I was in into now getting my Easter Bunny stuff on and they have this. It turns",

It turns out now if you use a referral code, you get little tokens to unlock stickers and stuff like and I've gotten many of you have used my referral code in the past. I'm now asking you to do it so I can go get um all these stickers that I would like. I'm not going to get the cat ears probably. So, if you use my if you want to go to Monster Hunter now, whatever. I guess this is my blue sky and then use the referral code 2. No, sorry. T22 CJ5V6. I would like that. That would help me out because I want I want to get all the stickers. So, this is a tough one. I forget what year Monster Hunter World came out. Was that 20 2018 or 17? I got 17. I mean, here's the thing, and keep me honest, chat, and you're wrong. Um, by 2023, Borderlands 3 sold over 18 million copies. 2018. 2018. So, from 20 2018 to 2023,",

So, from 20 2018 to 2023, uh, that's a 5-year period. Uh, Borderlands 3 sold over 18 million copies. Monster Hunter World. Um, oh, wait, no. Monster Hunter World came out in 2018. 2019 would have been Borland Ste. So that's a four-year period. Uh Monster Hunter World, which released in 2018. Uh by December 2024, had sold 14.9 million lifetime. So Borderlands 3 does have the upper hand there. Okay. Okay. Okay. But it's a new era. It's a new era. New generation. And again, what is the hype level for Borderlands 4? I feel like it is not what it was for Borderlands 3. Granted, we're still a ways out. Yeah. So we'll see. I think Summer Gamefest will be telling. Okay. I'm also I also wonder if that is if we're speaking to the core gamer audience of like the kind of funny audience because like Borderlands is so mainstream.",

Nobody's offended. The normies aren't watching the show. That's true. Doesn't watch the show. He doesn't know what they're talking about. They [\u00a0__\u00a0] watch the show.
