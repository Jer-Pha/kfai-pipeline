If you remember that review conversation when we were all just a few hours into or whatever, I had a great time with Ronin because it was an Assassin's Creed style samurai playground where I'm running. I'm jumping off throw my thing. Come down. I'm assassinating people. But it was I'm clearing the map and I'm getting more powerful and I don't know what the story isn't. They're not trying to make a samurai movie with Rise of the Ronin. I was the one who like [\u00a0__\u00a0] talked it the most because about 3 hours in I I said on kind of like that preview or whatever it was whether it was review or not you know this it just it's lacking sauce. Yeah. Yeah. And with Rise of the Ronin if I were to put like letter grades on [\u00a0__\u00a0] their combat is a tier that I mean that's Coway Techmo that is it that combat is phenomenal right?

So, I gave it a three out of five and we all did because we were like, \"Yeah, the combat rocks. It's just not much else is good in this when it comes to voice acting or uh cut scenes or cinematics or story.\" But like for me, Rise of the Ronin and Ghosts of Sushima, I'm looking at like a like [\u00a0__\u00a0] S tier combat for Rise of the Ronin and A tier for Ghost of Sushima. Now, everything else in Ghost of Sushima is A as well for me. And Rise of the Ronin drops down to like the D's and the B's when it comes to story and characterization and compelling interactions, making me give a damn about what's happening in the world.

That game has some of the most [\u00a0__\u00a0] gut-wrenching, heartbreaking side quests that really, really hit you in the fields.

I'm not the Perry Poppy guy or and I mean I like combat, but I don't like the challenge or this or whatever. I thought the combat was so good in Sushima that I also was seeking out challenge and I was also seeking out these people. And was it repetitive? I don't think so because for me it was always about getting better and finding the parry window and doing the thing and like what is the mechanic I'm going to use here to fight this and then you know those one-on-one samurai duels you'd have and stuff like I thought it was so incredibly special on that front.

Creative director Jason Connell said, \"One of the changes uh, compared to Ghost of Sushima will be a less repetitive open world.\" Quote, \"One challenge that comes with making an open world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over and over again.
