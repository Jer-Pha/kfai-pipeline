It's a mixup. You don't get kind of funny games cast after your normal kind of funny games daily. Today you get me and Nick and Bear running in the ones and twos for just a little bit playing some more games for your enjoyment until we go live for this afternoon's Borderlands 4 presentation with that will be happening 2:00 p.m. West Coast best coast time 1:45 for the pre-show and beyond beyond. So you can check that out. We're going to have some a whole lot of fun with all that. But I'm here to get you hanging, get you comfortable, and get you through the workday or the school day with your friends over at Kind of Funny. Today is a good day. We are back for more Escape from Taroff. As you know, this week is dedicated to me and Nick going from total noobs to probably just beginners. But like, we're going to become pros",

But last night, last night, shout out to the kind of funny community, shout outs to the best friends, and shout out to Bacon. Bacon came on and gave me the full-on crash course run through of Escape from Tarov. And I'll tell you what, I got gear, I got guns, and I got the knowledge now. So, I'm very, very excited to have some fun. But of course, before we do that, Nick Scarpino is currently working with the contractor to check out our gate right now for the parking lot.

So, uh, or I should say May, but yeah, we're gonna just play a bunch of video games together and have some fun. Uh, before we get into it, Chad, who's, uh, who's jazzed up about Borderlands 4? Are we excited for that one? Mike, have you played Expedition 33? Handy, I have. I played the first hour of Expedition 33. I enjoyed it a lot.

This isn't I'm going to run it back a second time. So, like for me in particular, similar to what you see a lot with the streams is like if I review this game, I'm never going to play it after the review. Yeah. If we stream it, then that's where I'll play it. But I'm a I'm a one anddone Borderlands man. Okay. Okay. But I'm excited. You know, they've promised a lot of new writers that we know.

As an elite mercenary, you'll join the expedition tasked with unearthing the secrets of the monolith and face off against the deadly automatons within. In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith, accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams. Each cardoggram affects which enemies, boss fights, and loot will appear when you enter the monolith, so no two excursions will be the same. Find even more cardiggrams to explore by looting defeated enemies, or buy them from other players online at the trading post. You'll need to make sure you have the right gear to take on the harder Cardoggrams. Build your mercenary, choose your gear, master your abilities, and take down everything in your path in Imperial.

Not critical, but just in case you break a leg. Do I have right above your pain pills or right to the left of the measuring tape? Oh, I see. So, I put it in my vest or put it in your backpack or your pouch. You're not going to use it quickly, so it's not a rush. Okay, pouch it is. All right. Yeah. Question for you guys is what do you all want to do? Where do you all want to go? Do you uh Well, before we do that, I want you to look at mine really quick, Bacon, just to double check me. I feel",

Go to the bottom of this one right here, Nick. And we're going to set FOV to 63 and head bobbing to minimum. Uh, in a lot of games, FOV is a preference. In Tarov, it it generally works best at 63. Some people use other ones, but in general, that's good. I should not crank it up to 200.
