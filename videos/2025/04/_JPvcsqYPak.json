Oh man, these guys have a like casting and direction that is just very good at interpretating or interpreting interpreting what the video game did. Uh, but finding a way to make it fit within the cast they have, the characters they have. There are slight differences that I think make sense because of, you know, who the characters are, who they're being played as.

I don't I don't even know if Pharaoh is the right word, but there's something there's something about Bella Ramsay and her like from the getgo being like, \"Yo, stop pulling punches.\" All this [\u00a0__\u00a0] right?

I like the expedition of the stalkers. I thought that was very entertaining. Um, and overall, oh, the therapy scene, I think for me was by far my fa my favorite addition uh to this opening sequence of uh this season two, right?

I think just did so much for Pedro Pascal's um performance of Joel and honestly like has me kind of concerned is the wrong word, but I am when he's gone from the season, I'm going to be so sad. You know what I mean? Like I expect that to happen probably by next episode and we're going to get flashbacks. We're going to get all that stuff. But once he's out, I'm going to be like, man, I hope I'm not going to miss Pedro Pascal a lot because he's doing such a good job in this first episode. So that's my impression.

I really love uh getting to see Joel with his the glasses on trying to figure out just building, right? He's construction. That's what he was before. Here he is. That's what he contributed to Jackson. Obviously, the Catherine Hara scene, the the therapy session is just I give me an entire show of that, right? Like so well done.

And then, yeah, I think especially to what Bless said there, Bella Ramsay's Ellie not being the Ellie from the game, being a much more angry, visibly angry Ellie. I loved the little droplet in the front there of like, okay, cool. Yeah, they do these MMA barn fights, right, where they are training. They this is what their world is.

And what will set them off in their journey, which I think immediately does what we've all talked about leading up to this, makes her more sympathetic. Makes them more sympathetic.

Tim loved it and, you know, I don't think it's any surprise. I really loved season one for uh how true it stayed to the games, but then also for the changes it made to adapt it to TV. I don't think every single thing was perfect in the game or in the uh the show, but I think that uh going into this one, I wasn't concerned, but I was very interested on what choices are you going to make to make this work for TV. And so far, they've really succeeded in that. I think that showing us the um Abby stuff so early, but also not showing everything was a really wise call. Like having the giraffes be seen like and us knowing what that meant of like time and place of like, oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] they're in Salt Lake City. like this is",

I'm like, \"Oh, this is cool. I can't believe they're doing it this way.\" But they didn't necessarily show it was Aby's dad, the doctor. You know what I mean? Saving that, right? Like Yeah. Exactly. And I I I think that that's that's smart because it get gives us enough to go off with this group and understanding the motivations, but it's still leaving the opportunity for a kind of like very like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] moment to come later in the season.

The plot is amazing, too, but I feel like that's the real story of it. And adapting that to a show is kind of difficult. But I think that adding things like the therapist scene and allowing us to have that conversation with uh Joel and uh Tommy's wife uh talking about the refugees, like they're really, I think, recontextualizing Jackson and the world that we know to set up familiar story beats, but done in different ways.

Um, but I like that because I think it just adds depth, especially with, you know, political situations going on now of like trying to take a story that can be timeless in so many ways, but make it make sense in a different medium. And so far, I think that Craig and Neil and the team have just done a perfect job of adapting what matters about the game, but also changing it enough so it's not just the exact same thing.

Got it. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. And I mean, well, now there is the thing of like the the fun reveals of Eugene, who was the the weed guy from the game that gets a very bill in terms of game storytelling uh thing in the game. Now, we know that that is a way more important character to the show because of Katherine O'Hara's uh relationship to him, but I love the idea that the show is going to probably use that as a Bill episode type thing. I wonder with the limited run time of seven episodes, I don't expect to see a full Eugene episode, but maybe they combine it like with flashbacks when we do see the the weed like when they're smoking smoking [\u00a0__\u00a0] You know what I mean? Maybe we get like the cuts to to kind of explain that like maybe they read something that says Eugene or whatever and",

Um, Ellie blowing up on Joel in that dance scene hit so much for me, but also like it's such an interesting place we're in for Ellie's character where like this is a show that is going to end up being about anger and rage and revenge in the same way that the game is about anger and rage and uh and revenge.

I like that it it feels different from what we got in the game cuz I think that allows them to kind of tap into that teenage emotion that sure the game has, but already I feel like we're getting something from this that the relationship between this version of Joel and this version of Ellie feels grounded in like such a way that obviously the the betrayal that he has and especially this episode starting with uh the reshowing the very end of the the first game and the end of the first season of like like like do you promise me that like that you and he just straight up lies and to",

Like the was the Washington Liberation Force, right? I think if she has people that are around her that are more tactically trained because this is their style of survival versus Ellie coming up with Joel during that year of Last of Us one and being a bit more brooding.
