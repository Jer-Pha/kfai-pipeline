I blacked out a little bit during that opening intro. You know, it's Monday. Mike's in full control of the office today, which means it's a it's a little out of whack, right? I need Greg.

How was everything for you? It was great. I played a few games. Uh had some hot dogs and yeah, you know, helped my girlfriend play through a little bit of Blueprints. Uh which I sort of understand now. It's, you know, based on Blue Prince. I get it. But yeah, it was it was a good No, you didn't just say that. My mind exploded. I didn't know that.

I I nothing too wild. I like to lay a pickle down on it once in a while. Okay. I like that. I like that. I'm a ketchup and relish guy, but I agree. Ketchup and mustard, that's the go-to.

You know, I played a little bit when it first came out and already I knew this was going to be a game that I want to spend some time in. And especially like compared to other Assassin's Creed games, like little bit of a learning curve. I was dying a lot and getting my butt whooped, but spent some time in it this weekend. Started understanding like how the skill tree works and starting to learn my moves with I think it's Ni. Ni, am I pronouncing her name right? Barrett, give me a thumbs up.

The reveal will take place on Bethesda's YouTube and Twitch channels. Given previous reports, it's also possible that the reveal will announce that the game is being released on the same day. The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered is reportedly a complete visual remake of the game and will also include gameplay updates. A time presentation titled All Will Be Revealed is currently on Bethesda's YouTube channel. It's finally real. Jerica, of course, this was one of my all-time favorites.

Um so, but I've heard nothing but like extravagant tales of how wonderful this game is. Um, you know, I think it came out in like 2007, 2008. It's been a long time. I could be wrong, but just knowing like I can finally, you know, experience this game and hopefully, yeah, being a remake and add some extra mechanics and way to play like I'm going to be playing the best version. So, yeah, I'm definitely down. I I think it would be really cool if it actually does like just like a shadow drop. That will be neat. You don't get that that often these days.

I'm very excited for new fans of Elder Scrolls to be able to jump into this because this is a game that came out in 2006. It is very old, right? And shout out to Xbox backwards compatibility. You can play this right now. I've booted up my save from so long ago, but really it looks old. It plays a little old, but it still has that Bethesda charm and the gameplay that you know and love. So, if we weren't getting this, I would still say Oblivion's an awesome game that you should try and play.

And for me, I'll never forget Jerica. Me and my little brother as Xbox guys. We started out with Marowind and then we went to of course uh Oblivion. I bought the horse armor way back in the day. And I'll never forget my time in Siridil running around the big capital stopping all of the uh Oblivion gates from opening, fighting off the DRI princes, and then at the very end having the big finale, which I won't spoil, but hey, spoilers. It's a very old game. you're going to see it and you're going to know it. Uh, but it's really, really awesome.

I think it's pretty cool to say like, you know, I I I haven't played it, but I've, you know, I've read about it, but just like, you know, that kind of game coming out in 2006, um, is wild.

Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser addresses cries for another mainline Mario entry during a recent interview with CNN. While he stopped short of promising that there is indeed a follow-up to Super Mario Odyssey on the way, it sounds like it's not the kind of thing fans will have to wait to wait too long to see more of. Quote, \"Stay tuned.\" Bowser said, \"You know, we have a long, long catalog and a long list of intellectual property that I'm sure we will that that I'm sure will make its way to the platform.\" Bowser's comments are far from confirmation that a new 3D Mario game will be announced soon, but it's at least something for",

Jerkica, a lot of people ask, \"Where's Mario? Are we going to get a new Mario game?\" you're not getting it here for the Switch 2 launch, but Doug Bowser and the team say you don't maybe stay tuned. You don't have to wait long. How do you feel about that? I mean, we talked a little bit about this on our podcast, and you know, it is it was very strange not to hear like also an announcement for um a new Mario game to be close to Switch 2 launch, but we're getting Donkey Kong, which is pretty neat. Um but so that wasn't as surprising.

Is that the big launch one? Do they have something up their sleeve? You also talk about Kirby Air Riders. Uh, so you have what I think it's four big ones. Bear, you can correct me on that, but I believe in my head it's Mario Kart World, of course, you have Donkey Kong, Metroid Prime 4, and then you have um Kirby Air Riders will be your big four. Do we slide in a fifth somehow? Is Mario really in that or we wait until next year beyond for Mario? Yeah, I I can see it happening either way.

Like they're so they're the core they have the core things that we love about a 3D Mario game. Yeah. But like they always introduce something new. So like surprise me. I I want to see Mario do something else. Like what else can he do? Like so I'm impartial. I like that. Yeah. I think anything 3D Mario is a big win. Anything Mario of course is a win. Anything Nintendo related is a big win for this company and gamers alike. So, I think it will be very exciting no matter what.

We've told you all how important it is to developers to wishlist games you're interested in on Steam. So, if this game sounds cool to you, make sure that you wishlist it. In Imperial, you play as a mercenary sent to a distant planet to discover the mysteries of an ancient civilization. Powers unknown lie within the monolith, but those are no mere ruins as an expedition has already ventured inside with only a few survivors. Why was it built? What powers reside within? Who is at the center of the monolith? All these secrets and more will be uncovered if you are brave enough to take on Imperial.

And I think to many this probably won't be for them, but I think if you give it a try, it might have a really good story that will get people in. I think of games like Gears Tactics. I think of Marvel's Midnight Suns, right?

I think the general audience is not sold on that for a certain price tag. Right? We celebrated Hell Divers because it got away from PvP and was a great PvE co-op experience game that we were down to pay for, right? It proved that it was well worth it. And so far, nobody has really gone hands-on besides a number of creators, but the general public hasn't seen this or played this yet to this extent.

Right. And then they're going to immediately turn off. And sure, this game isn't really geared for that. But I do think that Bungie, Sony, and the world is looking for this to take the extraction shooter from a niche genre to a little bit bigger, right? I think they want a larger audience than what we currently see.

Um, and you want people to feel like they're missing out and wanting to hop in and like want to play this with their friends.

And if the rig if you're rigorous about it, then those things can happen.\" End quotes. Also in the interview, Airman said fans can likely look forward to a Minecraft movie, too. Before this, we'd uh heard other reports of a potential sequel, and now Airman is joining the chorus. I mean, we'd be foolish not to. He said, \"The fans want more.
