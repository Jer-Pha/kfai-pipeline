I'm one of your show hosts, Snow Bike Mike, and today I'm joined by a great panel of awesome guys over here. We got Paris Lily coming in via Discord. Hi Paris. How are you? Hey, what's up? How's How is everyone doing? Paris, I'm much better when I get to see your face. It's been quite some time since you and I got to hang out. Is always nice to uh spend some time and talk video games, especially a Bungie video game, which I know you love. Absolutely. You know, I'm a huge Bungie fan. So excited for the conversation today. Big reveal happened this Saturday. Blessing. Bungie finally showed off gameplay for Marathon, the big extraction shooter. That's going to be the topic of the show Saturday. Tell me what you were doing. I was playing Magic with the homies. I thought about doing a Twitch stream. I think Andy went live during Was that correct? Yeah, Andy was doing it. I ended up",

I thought it was going to be like almost like more of a showcase, like 30 minutes to an hour of like here is everything. And they did their thing, right? like we'll talk about it, but it was just different in format. But yeah, I was I was playing Magic Commander. You're the best. I love that. And of course, rounding out the squad is Andy Cortez. He has a 2hour long video breakdown of him live reacting to the marathon.

Andy, two hours of fun watching that live on Twitch. How did it go? Well, mainly two hours cuz I kind of forgot to stop the stream. I just kind of kept on yapping. I was like, I got to end this VOD. Like, this is right now we're just talking about other games. So, like we're, you know, I've definitely gone a little too long here.

Paris needs a a night on the couch watching some good television. It sounds like uh later, guess what? We're assembling the team. It's time to jump back into Marvel Rivals with the launch of season 2.

Scavenge the lost colony of Taetti 4 in Bungie's team-based extraction shooter. Choose your runner cybernetic mercenaries with unique abilities as you battle rival teams and security forces for weapons and upgrades. Fill your vault. Take on high stakes challenges and unravel the colony's mysteries. Oh, wrong marathon. Sorry. That is your marathon write up.

I think it looks amazing visually. I loved hearing other creators talk about their time with it and what they think the potential can be. I think it's uh kind of a weird one because this I think extraction shooters are such a niche genre that it's there's a lot of people that there's a lot of like normies out there that aren't constantly playing the newest games and maybe only play War Zone and other battle roytoplay title is I think it's a bit hard for those players to try to wrap their minds around the game loop and I think even based on what a lot creators were saying and videos that I watch from people like Skill Up or um I watch Dr. Lupos's video on it as well and them mentioning that maybe the gameplay loop isn't",

And it kind of just feels like everything that we've been shown so far that this this is giving me a lot of Destiny 1 vibes where maybe it's not fully fully cooked. And I and that's I think you could look at that statement kind of from both angles, negatively and positively because I put a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ton of hours into Destiny 1, even though I knew that, you know, this isn't exactly what I think is a perfect video game, but I'm still kind of addicted to the loop of it all. Um, I think this will I think it's going to catch a lot of people off guard and a lot of people are also going to say, \"Dang, this isn't a PVP exclusive only game. I'm good. I'm out.\" And maybe not even I'm out because you still have to pay a premium price to even get in to it. So, I'm I hope they do a lot",

So, I'm I hope they do a lot of sort of free alphas and things like that to get people acclimated with what the with what the video game is. But um just from a from a nerd design standpoint, this is like the freshest thing I've ever seen in a long time. I love the art style. I love the look of the guns, the look of the weapons, and I was kind of discouraged by there not being a a central hub when me and Mike played a a game called The Cycle Frontier, which was kind of my first foray into an extraction shooter. whenever you go want to do missions or whatever, there's a player hub and you go talk to the NPCs and you see them standing there. And this has very much what a lot of people have told me is very similar to Tarov, which is the premier extraction game where you're just kind of accepting missions and menus. I'm kind",

I'm kind of bummed out about that. I hope maybe they can continue to develop that to, you know, make the player more immersed. Really bummed out there's no uh character creator, but that was leaked a while back. We kind of knew and expected that. But yeah, you are essentially selecting from pre-created heroes. And of course, there's going to be customization on top of that. I'm just really bummed out with the idea that you being a consciousness uploaded into a synthetic robot body that there's not a whole lot of agency you have there because you're kind of just picking I'm going to pick pick Glitch who is the character that does this or I'm going to pick whatever.

Also, I think extraction shooters are made all the more exciting with uh with Prox Chat and that not being here. While understandably the devs going, \"Yeah, it's just not where it is where it needs to be because of how toxic it can be and how off-putting it can be.\" But that also lends so much to the extraction thrill. Um, however, the gunplay and everything still looks so freaking fantastic and fun and the moves and the visuals look amazing that I still want to despite it not being what I want it to be, I'm still going to put a lot of hours into it because it's a Bungee shooter and those usually feel really fun to play.

Like what are your guys' expectations for day one of this game because when you say Destiny, I think about the time that it took for Destiny to build and get people on the side of, oh, this is [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome, right? Like was it the Taking King or whatever it was that was like the turning point of people going, \"Oh, no, this is now fantastic. We [\u00a0__\u00a0] with this thing. We love this thing.\" Do you think that when this launches day one, it's going to be in a place where people understand it and love it? or do you think it's going to take time to get there?

And then the follow-up question is, if it takes time, how good does it need to be to be given the luxury of time? Paris, I love how you throw it right to me. Um, let let me rewind a little bit and then I will answer that question, blessing, because I do want to kind of have some takes on what Andy just talked about as well. So, for full disclosure with me, I went to Bungie in the summer of 2023 to get hands-on with uh Marathon. And since that time, I've been a part of their creator program. So, I have not played it since then. I did not play this alpha, but I've been able to sit in, for lack of a better term, some town halls with with Bungie where they're talking to the creators. They're showing us some concepts where they're headed with it. a lot of the stuff that wounded up in the alpha. I got to see some weeks back and then uh we did a Q&A on it, stuff like that. So, I've seen the progress over the past couple",

So, I've seen the progress over the past couple years of what the game is, but I've not physically played it since the summer of 2023. Um, also pricing is a thing. I'm sure we'll have a whole discussion about pricing as well. So, I I won't dive into that right now other than to say when I was at Bungie, they were doing Q&As's with us back then and they were talking about monetization and trying to figure out, you know, what the best path would be. But, I'm sure we'll have a whole discussion about that. So, when I played it, they weren't doing these specific hero classes at the time. It was you kind of create your character. You go in and the whole 3v3 concept, the PvP PvE concept of the extraction shooter was all there at that time. And even two years ago, it's it's Bungie. The the it felt good. It felt really good to play. The shooting",

It felt really good to play. The shooting mechanics, weapons, everything about it felt really good to play. We definitely got into some intense situations just in the play session that we had. So, I walked away from that feeling good about what Marathon potentially could be. But even back then, we're like, obviously, this still needs needs more work. They're going to have to be able to explain it. And one thing that you keyed on, Andy, which I 100% agree with. I know they're going to do this closed alpha now, I'm assuming they're going to do some kind of open beta in the summer before September, because I think that's going to be part of it. They got to get people to actually understand, especially on the console side, what is an extraction shooter? What does it mean to go into this world? You're looking for loot. You're you got",

You're looking for loot. You're you got to get out. you have to successfully extract it to be able to keep it to get some permanent upgrades, perks, obviously the weapons, things like that. Because to your question, blessing, I don't think people are going to get it day one. That would be my one thing. I don't think this is going to be something that's going to immediately click. And even if you go all the way back to Destiny 1, it really wasn't until people got to play the raid that people truly started getting addicted to Destiny and it became the phenomenon that it was. This isn't necessarily from the from what I know, I will say this isn't necessarily going to have some kind of moment like that, but that's what Bungie is going to need to explain over the summer is what is going to be that gameplay loop beyond just going on",

I'm sure again there's going to be some intense fun things that you're going to be able to encounter while you're in there, but is it going to be cuz I I did get to talk to a couple people that played to the alpha and we we had this conversation about it that I think there will be some initial fun here. I'm more concerned about month three, month six, year, you know, year two. Am I still excited to go back and play Marathon? And what is that content that Bungie's going to be able to deliver that's going to keep me coming back? because it's going to launch with three maps. Um, ultimately there will be six classes that you'll play at launch and then they're going to do four during this alpha. But what",

Can't wait for season five, six on down the road.\" So, there's still questions they need to to answer, but the art style, I I love it. Uh, visually, it's very impressive. Again, like I said, the the gun the game play that the gun play that I did even two years ago was already in a good place. So, I imagine it's an even better place now. So, I think people that are used to playing Bungee shooters, you're going to you're going to know what to expect as far as that goes. It's I just think the extraction part is the thing that they're going to really need to explain more to people. Yeah. I think one of the reasons I bring in even",

But that was a game that had two weeks. Granted, seemingly very low player base, right? And so when it is, oh, you have 2,000 concurrents, we got to pull pull the plug on this thing. Probably different from how a new Bungie title is going to come out where they have the built-in reputation, they have a built-in audience, they have a large amount of people.

Like what are the level of expectations that you guys think we should have by the time we get to what is it September 23rd when this thing comes out? It's it's such a hard thing to even think about because I feel like I'd have a much better answer if it were any other genre than this. Yeah. I this this being a genre that may not satisfy the people that only want PvP experiences and it may not even satisfy the people that only want PvE experiences.

They know they know how to make um an entry into a genre that like they have no business being in and somehow like making it work and making it one of the the best competitive things in the space.

And now it's a thing that, you know, any gamer knows what Destiny is. So many gamers love Destiny, right? I I would assume they're trying to do the same thing with Marathon as far as bringing extraction to way more people and then the question becomes like can they actually do that?

I think it's a thing of you don't know what you like or you don't like until you experience it. So I I take into account that Bungie is saying they want this to be a more social experience. So to what you were talking about previously, this has been Destiny for 10 years. That balance, them constantly trying to figure out that balance of we want to appease the hardcore people, but we want to lower that barrier of entry so the casual player doesn't get their loot taken four times in a row and said, \"F this and I'm out of here.\" So they have to figure that out.

Maybe that is more in-game type of stuff, more raid level stuff that the hardcore can experience and then maybe the other two maps is built around, you know, making it more a more casual experience so people aren't getting frustrated with it. Again, I can only go back to to what I played a couple years ago and what what they've they've shown me in concept, but I mean, I don't think this is not going to be like Tarov. I don't think they're trying to go for that hardcore experience. I think sure there's going to be some intense moments in there and I think we've even seen that in some of the alpha footage they showed on on on Saturday, but I also think they wanted that, hey, if you just want to go in there, you're going to fight some of the PvE bosses.

If you're going in there and because you're not a high-skilled player and you're constantly losing your loot, you're not going to play marathon. Bottom line. So, this is again where I think they need to show this off through this alpha over the summer. Talk about it. Show examples of this. Like, hey, here's some really hardcore experiences for the highest skill players, but here's some other instances for people that are brand new to an extraction hero shooter, and you know, here's how you can have fun and experience this game. and as you become more experienced and you you level up now, maybe you can take a chance and and go in some of these more high-end things.

You mentioning that Bungie is hoping for this to be their social, you know, they want this to be a social experience and I think Prox Chat lends so much to that. And I agree. I agree. I I I hope that they sort of, you know, allow players to at least have it off because there are without prox chat, you are only looking for PVE and I think if you want a social experience, you have to allow players to not have those PV uh or PVP moments rather.

I'm trying to finish this mission.\" And I've had that experience in the cycle where I was just playing solo at times because I legitimately enjoyed the cycle frontier and I that game's been shut down. Uh, I got think I got shut down last year, but there were several moments where I would hop in and have that prox chat moment, not knowing whether to trust this person or or this trio and suddenly we are playing together and then somebody else comes across us and now we're teammates and we're both fighting that other squad and you take them out.

Or maybe they don't. But I think if you are going for a social experience, it isn't a fully social experience if you're only looking for players to have PvP type experiences. If you're just expecting everybody to bump into each other and try to kill each other, then that's not fully social. Just say we want players to always be killing each other as opposed to we want players to experience a social moment, you know? So, I I'm I'm with you 100%.

If my squad wants to go in with proximity chat on, we have the option to turn it on or off. and the and the teams that don't want it on, they can turn it off and go from there. Or maybe by default it's off and you have to manually go in and turn it on. Maybe that's the option that you go with so that teams that want to have that experience can have that experience and the ones that don't don't.

Similar to Paris over the years seeing this grow, but the minute and 50 seconds gameplay reveal wasn't long enough for me. The fiveminute breakdown I think got a little bit more of like what I wanted. The 8 minute cinematic, as Andy brought up, was beautiful, stunning, very cool, a world that I definitely wanted to get lost in.

Fortnite pulled the casual audience into a niche gen or niche genre at the time. I think open beta will be huge.

I don't think this game and I for this game particular I got kind of varied opinions as far as like free to play not free to play yada yada but I think in general the only true thing I would say about across multiplayer games is that you just need a good release strategy and for a lot of games that is going to be free to play. I look at something like Concord and I'm like this probably would have benefited way more from free to play as opposed to coming out and being a $40 premium game. I look at something like Marathon and I could see the argument for free to play. I think this is something that if you are trying to be the Fortnite, if you are trying to be the most approachable, most accessible, biggest extraction shooter ever, um, you know, in terms of player base, reaching out all these reaching to all these different players, then yeah, you probably should be free to play.

It's you're also discounting the additional cost of needing the Xbox whatever or the PlayStation whatever to even play those premiumbric games online because you would still need that to play the game online as well. And that's an additional cost that a lot of people probably aren't paying for when their kids are playing Fortnite all the time.

Excuse me. But how many people are going to look at that and go, \"Look, the Destiny people, the Bungie fans, we're in. We're buying it. We're we're playing it. We're not the audience that I'm talking about. I'm talking about the more casual audience that you're trying to attract to this game. do they see $40 price point and go, \"Well, I don't know.

I don't have to worry about PvP. For all intents and purposes, this is a PvP game. So, going all the way back to something you already talked about, Andy, what if I'm coming into this and I realize, man, I I just I I I I can never extract this. This is frustrating. I'm putting this down. I don't want to play it anymore. Now, the player count goes down. Now, these are people going to be less willing to want to go try it because they're hearing word of mouth, maybe this isn't for me. Whereas, if at least it was free to play, people would be more willing to at least try it.

Yeah, I mean for me I Oh, I'll say real quick, right, for me watching the content over the weekend, right? Like I was I'm basically going to echo Andy's thoughts at the very top. I was pulled in by the visuals of it. I was pulled in by the moment to moment gameplay of it. I think the gunplay looks fun. It looks like a Bungie game, but the aesthetic of it, I think, is really enticing and looks really cool. And it's a game that, you know, we're talking about the Borderlands 4/Marathon release date. One of the things I was talking about yesterday during my stream was the fact that like you look across this office and there are so many people that are going to have to make a choice. Granted, there are people that probably fall on the side already, right? Greg's going to play Borderlands for most likely, right? Barrett probably going",

Yeah, but that's like, you know, 120 hours. You know what I mean? We played a lot of that game. I don't know if it was that long. This is a [\u00a0__\u00a0] longass game for no reason. Um, but like you then keep going through the office, right? And I can see Nick getting into Marathon. I think us three are probably going to have to make a decision as far as all right, Monday, we're playing Marathon. Tuesday we're playing Borderlands. And there's a lot of love to be spread around as far as the amount of I think people that are going to be playing either or.

It's a game that looks interesting. It's a game I want to know more about and it's a game that I think is wanting to do something fresh and it's new frontier for uh uh for Bungie. And so I'm in. My biggest question is how are those betas going to hit? like is that going to be are are those betas going to come out and and convince people on what what this gameplay loop is and convince them on oh I got to shout out the the price at launch and oh I'm I'm here for the gameplay loop long term.

That's the biggest challenge. But I I'm still in I've been a negative Nancy this whole time. I'm still going to play the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of this. I'm very excited about the gunplay, about the upgrade systems that I've heard a lot of con uh content creators talk about, and the world looks so freaking cool, and I'm stoked to see what the other maps look like.

I want to play Marathon. I will be there day one. Um, my concern, as we've already talked about, is the pricing. Let's, again, Bungie's going to need to convince people to want to spend that upfront. But even more so, it is, and if there's any company that's going to be able to do this, cuz they've been used to doing this for 10 years with Destiny, is the ongoing content. That's going to be the biggest challenge that I see for Marathon is I fully expect a fantastic season 1 coming from them. It's going to be after that. What are you giving me for season 2? Are you going to be able to keep up that cadence? Like Mike, you had alluded to Halo Infinite at one point. That was the downfall of Halo Infinite. They couldn't keep up with the demand for content and new modes and features and things like that. We know Bungie's",

So, as they get feedback, they'll they'll pivot as needed on things that the community is excited about, things that community isn't happy about. But that that's going to be the key to everything. The gunplay is going to be great. It's a Bungie game. You know, it's going to be fun as hell to play from a PvP standpoint. It's going to be intense. Just give me the loot. I like, like Biggie said, give me the loot. Give me the loot. I need cool loot to go chase to make me want to go on those runs and go back into that world and extract it. As long as they're able to keep that up, I think Marathon will be fine. Let's jump into uh some super chats to get us out of here.

I don't know on that one. I think there's a a little tad different look on the original one we saw a while back to what we're seeing now. I I get where you're coming from, but I like the look regardless. It looks good. Uh Sheffield Boulevard writes, \"Ooptimistic thinking.

The idea of risking of risking weapons and losing it to the computer is a lot easier for me to digest and losing it to other tryhard insane gamers that I think Creed uh in the Twitch chat made a great point talking about how that's why fighting games are such a niche market because people aren't willing to spend $60 to get their ass whooped by people that have been playing fighting games their whole lives.

That's kind of the double jinx reverse Uno card of this whole thing, right? We're already in this world of these forever games. And how do you wean people off of that and get it back to where it used to be? Because sure, a bungee can try this, but a firewalk tries it and they last 10 days and they completely go away.

So, you know, there's a lot of risk with that. Like again, Marathon is a risk. Let's be crystal clear on that there. This is not a 100%, you know, surefire thing. There is risk that Bungie is taking with Marathon with with this format. So, we'll see if it works. Hope I hope it does. Let's be clear. I hope this works and then you'll see more people do the same thing. We need more space marine twos and we need more out rididers. I think that's I think that's what it is. We really do.
