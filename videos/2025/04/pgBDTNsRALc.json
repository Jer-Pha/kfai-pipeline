So, as I talked a little bit on Games Daily, for me with Oblivion, it is very interesting of I don't know how this game was marketed slashtalked about that turned me off to it. Now, granted, I don't know if I would have told you back in 2006, I was a RPG fan. I think that meant a very different thing. You've heard me talk on many shows throughout the years, 18 years of people coming back at IGN from previews and being like, \"Yeah, whatever game, the game they're previewing, yeah, it's got RPG mechanics. It's an RPG light. It's got all this stuff.\" which meant, you know, experience points and skill trees and stuff that was not uh in every game as it is",

So, I wonder what my hang-up was and why I thought RPGs would not be for me or why I thought this wouldn't be for me. Again, I think maybe because of its uh medievalish, I thought it maybe somehow more like WoW or whatever. I don't know what turned me off to it, but it did. But here we are starting again. Never touched it, never played it. I'm excited. Oh, and license. You know how that is. You got to agree. Got to agree. Crush Lemon says 2006. I was a senior in high school.
