And I walk back to my desk and I see there's a box on my desk with a cactus on top of the box. And Mike said, \"That's your birthday gift. I got that for you.\" Birthday was in February, granted. Um, thanks. And I And Roger immediately puts him, you know, kind of breaks the fourth wall and says, I asked Mike, \"What are you doing?\" And he said, \"Anoy Andy.\" So, like for anybody who thinks that this is all done out of love and no, he's just he wants to annoy me and anger me. He wants you thinking about him, you know, he wants to get in there in there. He texted me yesterday, \"Nick, I got I got you a gift.\" And I just replied, \"Oh, no.\" Y and this it's basically him saying, \"You take care of this.\" Yeah.

Let's Let's dial this back for a second. First off, I believe the words he used, he didn't say he wanted to annoy you. He just said he wanted to get you really uptight. Yeah. I want to get him up tight. I want to get him upight, which is actually kind of worse. Then can you imagine a reality where you literally are on a date with someone and they go, \"Hold on a second.

We both know what we're doing because we're buying Starbucks. That's what Mike and I do. You may as well have been together. Yes.
