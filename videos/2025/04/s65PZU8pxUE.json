I brought my Steam Deck out. That's how you know it's serious. Yeah. All right. So, I can play through the game as I'm talking about the game.

I think I tentatively gave it a nine out of 10, but now that I've beaten the game and I'm further into it, I'm a 10 out of 10 for this video game. Uh, let's start with Kevin. Kevin, first of all, have you beaten Blueprints? Yeah. All right, you've rolled credits. It's beaten is also a weird word to use. Well, I mean, that's the thing. We got to room 46, right? That's what we say when we say beat it. And uh I think I got there probably around like 24 hours into the game, which was just awesome and heartbreaking also cuz my like first or second run, maybe it was my first run, I got right up to it and it was like, \"Oh, there's no door.\" You know what I",

What am I missing here? And it's just it the game is so so rewarding and so good at building you up and and you know you pick up notes and you're like it like so much of the game isn't just getting to the end. It's about understanding all the puzzle pieces y and seeing how they fit together and and by the end by hour 24 I had multiple options. I think I might have had all three doors open too. So it felt really good. But I don't know how deep we getting in spoilers here. Spoiler territory. If you're watching this if you're listening to this and you don't want spoilers for blueprints one.

There's postgame. There's stuff beyond that. And so, I think we can talk about the I think I think everything is on the table, but let's not like just give blatant solutions to like postgame stuff. Like, we can talk about the fact that there's letters. We can talk about like sanctum keys or whatever. Like we can talk we can talk about it but not necessarily where they are. Yes. Okay. All right.

No, I mean it was it's nice for when you're like figure out how to open it and now you're going back and forth, but when you have to go the big run and for the first time getting into room uh 46, it's uh it makes it quite a challenge. And I got to the point where opened it, went back up, and I was like two steps away. And it's like, all right, I guess one more run. But then I found an apple and I made it in. Oh, nice. But I was also I've been playing a lot on my portal just because it's convenient. You know, the family wants to watch the TV. Thank God for the portal.

And I was like, \"Okay, burned a lot of time that I could have used going into that room and figuring stuff out and learning more puzzles.\" Yeah. How many How many days are you into blueprints now? How many hours? I think I I don't know the hour count cuz like I'm not going to lie to you.

I'm going to try and solve all these small little things and get like some duads going. Uh got really really into uh the upgrade system. Yeah. And and permanent upgrades.

Okay, so you know when you get an upgrade disc and it like shuffles the different options to upgrade a room. I uh had the option for the aquarium and then like the first two are pretty good like you get two keys or you get two gems or whatever and then the third one was uh electric eel upgrade acts as an alternate source of power. Really good. Interesting. So instead of having to draft up the boiler room, if you draft like a room that needs power and it's right next to the aquarium, boom, you get power over there.

I got to the I I I just like that this game is as hardcore kind of as you want it to be cuz there were so many times early on where I was just fumbling through building rooms. I mean, learning even learning what a step is. That was like moment one, you know? I I see that I have these footprints in the top corner. I'm going in rooms. I'm wandering around.

Just from that basic knowledge and then how that continues on throughout the game, I think is what makes blueprints so freaking special. And then and then it just became like, okay, well, I really like rogike games, so I'm just going to try and fill out my book of rooms. So pretty much every time I saw a new room, I would just build a new room. And then as I kept trying to build the new rooms, I just kept discovering like small little things. And then I think I I accidentally like built the greenhouse one time and there was a lever in there and then I was pulling levers and doors were opening.

Uh, and I just I really love that organic learning element of blueprints cuz it's never like insanely complex. there's just kind of a lot to keep track of. I think that's the difference of why I really like it a lot because some puzzle games, you know, I think of Talos Principal and it's like here's a really insanely complicated puzzle, but then Blueprints is like here's like 20 or 30 really subtle clues and puzzles that you can tackle. And that's what I love about it. I think the the subtlety about it is one of the very special things because like I was playing going back and forth between playing blueprints and playing expedition 33 during review and there there was a day where I had done like maybe two or three days of playing blueprints and I put it down and then I switched",

It's the fact that like blueprints at a certain point you learn to pay attention to every single [\u00a0__\u00a0] thing. Like I I learned to play to pay attention to the paintings at like day maybe 25 or something.

Well, so when you get more classrooms, you learn more stuff. Yeah. And I think that I just need to double down on more classrooms. How far have you gotten in the classrooms? Uh, no. I I've only done like three of them. That's what I'm saying. Like that's the one that's the thing that I've just not paid attention to. And like in room 46 there's a big map thing, right? And you got to put numbers on there with pins and it's like okay so once you know what sanctum goes to what pin and you know okay you're going to figure out stuff and it's like I can't like so now my next run is going to be I got to double down on classrooms.

So I had that those screenshots for like 10 rooms before I actually was like in the tomb and I'm like I've seen this before. For me, I knew like I was on the search for like what how do I unlock the tomb puzzle because I I felt like that was going to lead me to cuz I had found um uh I had found the basement key.

Imperial is a complex, featurerich action RPG where you'll be sent to a planet in a faroff corner of the galaxy to explore enormous imposing monolith. As an elite mercenary, you'll join the expedition tasked with unearthing the secrets of the monolith and face off against the deadly automatons within. In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith, accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams. Each cardoggram affects which enemies, boss fights, and loot will appear when you enter the monolith, so no two excursions will be the same.

Mine was like two two rooms away from the anti chamber. Yeah, mine was rank eight. Sounds pretty blessed. It was It was very blessed, Kevin. Let me tell you. Yeah, mine's like rank eight like um row B. Oh, wow. That's so far up. How do you How do you decide where it is initially? I totally forget that part. Well, it's a random draw, right? So, whenever you get it, you open it, it says it's permanent. Yeah. It's funny cuz like you read that and I'm like, \"Oh, cool. I didn't I don't know what that means, but then you start the next run. I'm like, \"Oh, shit.\" All right, cool. I made a decision here. Did not realize I made a I made a decision. I I got to shout out any and everyone that is trying to do a guide for this game.

There's something special about that and something special about sharing it with people around you. Yeah, one last thing I just want to bring up that it's more a strategy building that I'm having right now of like if you can move the foundation and you can get in the foundation from an outside exit. Outside exit. What do you mean? So like somewhere from the outside. So let's say you pull tomb, right? Yeah. You can get into the foundation, right? As if you have a security door or a key, you can get into the foundation from the bottom. Yeah, cuz I thought the cart was always blocking it from tomb. Is it? Well, I So again, if you get the water at the right level. Oh, I see. That's not tomb, is it? No, cuz tomb is connected. Chad, help me out.

Where if you don't have the security key, the elevator won't come down. Oh. So, what I'm saying is if you can move your foundation to somewhere higher up now you have a second like you have three doors that can can lead you I see what you're saying. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. It's a damn good game. Wait, but you need a secure you need a security key to get to get out of it. Yeah, but like there's ways around that, right?
