Welcome in to your Kind of funny games afternoon stream with your boys Mike and Andy for a very fun sponsored stream teaming up with our friends over at Nvidia to show you the very best in video games. And Andy, we got a fun combo today. Season two of Marvel Rivals is now here. Nvidia DLSS4 and Reflex giving you the very best in Marvel rivals rivals performance to make you play at your best. Are you ready to rock? Of course I am. M cuz frames win games. Frames win games. You got to make sure though a lot of people don't remember this when they want to enable any of the DLSS stuff. Okay. The first thing you got to do is you you have to like just hit your Windows button on your PC and type in graphics settings. And if you do that, then one of the first popups you'll see, I don't even know if mine is showing. I don't think it is cuz I think I'm just caption. Oh, it is.

That's one thing that you kind of have to enable at the c it's like a kernel level type thing, but not really, but it kind of is. you turn that sucker on first and then you could get all the benefits of DLSS4 including the frame generation and all of that fun stuff because we all know the frames win games uh especially in multiplayer games especially when you're using something like reflex which allows uh which gives you shorter response time from when you click that button to the thing happening on the screen you want all of that time to be as short as possible and Nvidia is making it possible Because frames win games, Mike, I love that, Andy.

You've been so that now it's finally time to get you back involved, back into the fun. So, I'm excited for you to kickstart that engine. And I'm also excited to team up with our friends over at Nvidia for a fun sponsored stream. So this afternoon we'll be telling you all about DLSS4 and all the cool tech behind the scenes with Nvidia to get you the very best performance out of your gameplay, especially with Marvel Rivals and so many other video games. So sit back, relax, get comfortable, and also maybe if you're free, come join me and Andy. We'd love to fill out the team and have all of you come join us.

But Andy, before all of that, let's catch up. Let's talk about it. How do I get the very best? What do I have to do to turn on DLSS4? Mike, you need to hit the escape button. Escape. Then you go into your settings. Get out of here. And then under display, you want Nvidia DLSS on. Okay. If you're playing on a 4K monitor, maybe you go with something like balanced or or performance mode because what DLSS does is it if you're playing in 4K, it'll make that 4K image cuz it's really hard to make the game look good and run well at 4K resolution. But when you turn DLSS on, if you go to performance mode, it'll take that 4K image and make it, let's say, a 720p image, which is a lot easier to run things at high frame rate when",

But when you turn DLSS on, if you go to performance mode, it'll take that 4K image and make it, let's say, a 720p image, which is a lot easier to run things at high frame rate when your resolution is that small. But then it uses AI to rebuild that image to get it back up to the sharpness of 4K. Since I'm playing on a 1440p monitor, I normally go with quality mode, meaning that I'm not rendering everything at 1440p anymore. It goes down to like, I don't know, 900p, 1080p. I'm not exactly sure the right the numbers, but then it uses AI to rebuild it back up to 1440p. So, it looks insanely sharp. It looks amazing, but the game is going to be running smoother because of that. And then you want Nvidia Reflex low latency on. You turn that sucker on. Nvidia reflex low latency. You need that cuz frames win games, Mike. Nvidia DLSS frame generation. You turn that sucker on whether you want two, three, or four. Oh, and usually frame generation really good for playing a game",
