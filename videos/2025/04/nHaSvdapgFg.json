I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the trio you love to hate, the Jabroni boys themselves, Snowike Mike, Nick Scarpino, and Andy Cortez. I don't think that's what our tagline is, Greg. Isn't it you love to hate? The trio you love to hate. I don't see that on the posters anymore. I'm just saying like it could be right now. It probably is. Why? Where is the fan art, John? It's the trio you love to love. You love to love. Your favorite trio's favorite trio. You love to hate each other though, right? Well, that's Andy loves to hate. Andy hates both of you. We love him a lot. We love him so hard. Andy hates both of you. And then Mike is mad at Andy right now because of Unaccounted for Hours. Nick's mad at everybody for making him play Pokemon.

Of course, ladies and gentlemen and MBs, of course, we're excited to return to Verdansk this Friday. Verdance returns after,200 days away. 3 years since these boys hot dropped Howard Hospital. Verance launched in 2020. Yeah, it's been 5 years since it first started. Three years since we could last play it. And so we're going to do a big marathon stream on Friday to get the boys back together. And guess what? All four of us will be live in the studio together. Chris Sen is coming up.

I So, the way that they pitched this to me was like they called me into the room and it felt like the way they were pitching it to me was we're leaving the company. That's how much desperation they had and like like they closed the door and like all right, Andy, you know, hear us out. Hear us out. They said Chris Anka wants to come up here. Hey, look, I'm excited to hop back into Verdans. It's just where I cut my teeth. It's why I discovered that like, holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm crazy at this video game.

And the dive is pretty much inception going into the person uh whoever's owning this place, whoever is, you know, the leader of whatever spot that we're in. We dive into their subconscious and have to kind of like do a thing to then get to to continue the heist essentially, right? Okay. And it's very very cool in the way that it's done.

That saved us quite a bit in a lot of moments where I went down at one point and you could only crawl so far before you can get resed. So, I crawled as far as I could, but I was right around a corner. So, I was kind of like trying to be a third eye for them, being like, \"There's two more dudes. There's three more dudes.

How did that setting go? Did was there ambiance? Cuz when I think of this game, I think of some really cool awesome atmospheric stuff that you you don't see in many other games. Yeah, the there were similar things being implemented in here that I experienced that I remember from GTFO. There's an enemy in GTFO, Greg, that uh obviously I already told you about the ones that are asleep and once they start breathing, that's when you know you got a it's like a red light, green light situation.

But you have to know that like if they're you can't run away while that's happening cuz you're making noise at that point, but when those tendrils go out, you have to avoid them and not get touched by them cuz that's awesome. That's them being aware of like, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] somebody's here in the room or whatever.\" And uh they implement that sort of same mechanic with some of the guards in this game where that's like their kind of like their their their AI awareness level or whatever. And they will you'll see those things go out and you're like, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] I got to back up. Back up.\" Like and you'll see it kind of extending towards you.",

Atmospherics, uh, and just the the the the ambiance of like how awesome the cyberpunk lighting is and everything, all of that totally like fits great and looks amazing. This is running on Unity 6. I was pretty blown away by that cuz like Unity has got it and they've had it for a while now. Um, but this looks really awesome and very very impressive visually.
