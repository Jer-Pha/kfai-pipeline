I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, holder of three of Tim Getty's stars from Game Showdown, alongside the other man who helped me beat Tim Getty's. We're crushing this guy.

Well, here's what I actually that actually brings a great point as you just saw there. I have seven stars. You have one. Tim has three. What do I need to do to get you to give me that one star?

Chipper Jones did that when he was retiring. Every stadium he went to, everybody give him like a little little gift on Games Daily.

But I think there are really cool ways to I I think what I'm just so stoked about is get like when we see that first guy ask her, \"Oh, who? I thought we killed your whole family, whatever.\" I I loved that characterization and I hope that they all have really distinct personalities. Uh, I have good news for you. Lady Snow Blood is on Max right now streaming, so I've added to my list. You could do that as well. Uh, CJ splits on super chats and says, \"Do we think they're deemphasizing stealth/ninja?\" I think absolutely not. I think we're seeing it very much through the lens here of getting ready to confront all these people in your duels. I think you'll still",

Yeah, you still I mean I think once we get a deeper dive of gameplay and whatever the next big PlayStation showcase or state of play or whatever it may be, that's when we might get a Here's what a stealthlike encounter looks like. Uh shout out to Lucid Dream who says uh I know you did uh with Nine Souls. Yeah, Nine Souls had that very similar thing that I loved about Sefue where every boss was so different. The leadup to it was so wildly um varied. What a fantastic video game. Uh, as I have told you throughout the show, uh, several sucker punch people have been texting me to talk [\u00a0__\u00a0] or, you know, just be jerks. Uh, one apparently is super chatting.

Uh, but apparently working at Sucker. Congratulations to you. That's awesome. Thanks for watching live and paying. Unlike the other sucker punch freeloaders who are just texting me to be jerks, you know what I mean? Cuz I can't read. Be cool. What if they don't give us review codes? Oh, trust me. They have no power there. That's all Sony PR. Don't get me wrong. You don't know. I'll tell you about the hierarchy and where it leads. Don't pick fights, Greg. Don't fight.

We're just reacting late with SGF around the corner. I guess that would be too close to release. I don't think it's so much close to release as much as we've talked about this a million different times of video games, video game marketing and marketing beats. I think you you want to have a beat where you get to talk and have the attention, right? And even though yesterday we kind of funny put our attention elsewhere, this is a chance for Ghost to come out. Here's the release date. Here's the pre-orders. here's when we're going to have the big box edition and go all that stuff and then yeah, I would hope hope at Sucker or I'm sorry at SGF they're doing demos",

Like there's lots of stops on the Ghost of Yote uh train we're on right now. So I I don't think it's weird to do this. This is how PlayStation usually does their stuff, right? They want their games to have their moment and they feel the blog and obviously all of this stuff can go out there and get it done. Well, I I mean I still think it was kind of odd that it was released in the way that it was like that that it wasn't this is what I come to expect from PlayStation. I think that it wasn't a a larger sort of on a larger stage. And when I mean stage, I just mean a showcase with a couple of other games. Um",

I was like oh no that's it was just a PlayStation blog thing. I especially for a trailer like this which seems a lot more important story-wise but the last one was more of hey let's show you how beautiful this world is that we're crafting but we're not necessarily giving you all the details. This one is very you know we are going you're getting the gist of what's happening in this experience. I was kind of surprised that it was in a in a blog on a random Wednesday drop. I think PlayStation does this a lot. And I also don't think it matters, right? Because a random drop this that the other.

Like it's this is one of those games that makes its own news cycle of like you want to talk about it, here it is. You don't need SGF necessarily for it. Again, SGF is for those in a lot of different ways. Double A's higher up and then a big reveal of course, but this is a known quantity. We know we're going to love this. We're going to have a preview event. I assume we're going to have the review stuff. You're going to have a whole bunch of stuff in the leadup to it.

Yeah, that's that's mainly where I'm at uh thoughtwise where that has to get revealed somewhere and sometime soon. Um do you want to sort of overshadow your upcoming game in that way? Like I the thought process there kind of makes more sense to me. When I think of if you were to release this trailer and wait for a summer gamefest thing, how dominated be by the big the other big day and summer gamefest is the place like a game awards where that Jeff showcase is the here's exclusive exclusive never before seen game reveal like again we know we can't wait for Yay.

Yeah. We're we're the we're the taste makers. We decide what works and doesn't work. Uh, final chat before we get out of here comes from Alex Frasier, uh, who super chats on youtube.com/confunn just like you can and says, \"This is my most anticipated game of the year and nothing will top it.\" I can say that with certainty. Sucker Punch is goated. Dude, this year, man, I can't believe that for me after somebody who's experienced a lot of blueprints. Yeah. and just completely marveling and astounded that, you know, humans are still capable of incredibly creative and wonderful things. Yeah.

Yeah. Or Gosote rather. I I can't believe how sneakily stacked this year has become crazy. Because I think at the beginning of the year, no, never mind. I'm totally lying. This year was always kind of like, \"All right, it's going to be crazy because of something like well, not only GTA, but also um freaking the new Doom, you know, like this.
