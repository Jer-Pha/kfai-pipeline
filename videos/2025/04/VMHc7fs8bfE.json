But I also don't think that the juice is totally gone there where if you made it with the right, this is just not EA's bag.

Continue to nurture Apex or revamp Apex. I'm so fascinated. Did they ever put in the Titans in Apex? No. Okay. And that and I don't know why.

Does that a thing like do you believe in skate enough to think that EA is going to keep it around for the long term? Well, I don't believe in EA enough to think that they're, you know what I mean? I don't believe in EA and in their commitment to video games and art and all this other stuff to figure that out aftermath for no particular reason. Let's look at how much EA execs recently made made recently. Um, I don't believe enough in EA's commitment to any vision. And that's my problem is again whenever they're EA's commitment to anything is money. And again, this is let's not act like everybody else is doing this for the love of the game",

But I do think EA is trying to make the most amount of money. And again, they have nearly 14,000 employees. Um, so do I believe in Skate? Do I believe in this? It's a harder question to answer. Is Skate going to catch fire to the level that EA wants it to to finance 14th? No. I I just don't think that's possible. I don't think that's possible. I think it's possible.

One of the main changes in this new firmware is that digital games are now referred to as virtual game cards and essentially act like digital cartridges. Players can virtually load and eject virtual game cards between two Switch consoles, meaning one console can have the the game present at any time. However, players are now reporting that this new system uh prevents two users with their own Switch consoles from playing the same digital game online at the same damn time. something that was possible before. In the past, Switch games bought uh using a main player's primary console could be played by any other account signed in on that console, including online. The main player could then sign into a secondary console and install the game there, too. The idea was that the first the the idea was that if the main player signed",

Uh the change to virtual game cards no longer makes this possible because there are no longer primary or secondary consoles. Now digital games are treated like physical cartridges cartridges, meaning they can technically only be active on one system at a time. Since the virtual game card system only launched a matter of hours ago at the time of writing, there are still checks ongoing to see how every permutation of the new system works.
