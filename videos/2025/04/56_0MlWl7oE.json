I'm one of your hosts, Blessing Addio Jr. Joining me is Lacroy Poppy Tim M [\u00a0__\u00a0] Gettys. Here's the thing, Bless. Yesterday, me and you did an amazing episode of the kind of funny games cast where we found a video game music quiz uh where every 10 seconds a different video game song would play 100 different songs ranging from very easy to very hard. We ran out of time because we had a big uh collab stream with Giant Bomb playing Monaco 2. That was a blast. You can check out the video on YouTube now. Uh but because of that, we didn't get to do the very hard the final 20 video game songs. So before we get into today's topic after you get through the housekeeping and all that stuff, I think we got to do a quick lightning round just to see what we had left. See, I'm scared because I think for yesterday's episode, not to spoil it for people, we started off very strong obviously because it goes from",

By the time we got through the latter half of that episode, hit a wall. It It was a struggle bus. We hit a wall. We started struggling by normal. So my fear is that we're very hard, we might not even get any. I mean, as long as we get one, I will chalk it up as a win because like, yeah, we we ended up getting 31 correct. Uh, but then once it got post easy and normal, we only got one, right? God. So, we have 20 left. Did we get one more? I thought I got like two back to back. I got I wrote down one and a half. Well, I think that that like one of those was still in the the easy or normal area. Oh, it's like once we got to hard, we're in a bad place. But anyways, we'll get to that in a sec.

Mike playing blueprints is like the most like with Kevin Backseat Gaming. with Kevin Backseat Gaming, especially because it's way more of a Kevin game, I think, than a Mike game.

Video games influence on popular culture has never been more prevalent. Their effect is visible in audible in today's music across the world of TV and cinema and on the catwalk.

Do you pick the pioneers that shaped the early days of the medium, the innovators that were ahead of their time, the ones that proved formative to your own creative journey, or simply the ones that made you most emotional? As might be expected, among the extraordinary number of responses we received was a staggering variety of games, ranging from titles that launched the industry to contemporary giants uh released mere months ago. The top 10 alone spans multiple genres from platformers to shooters, sandbox adventures to simulations.

I I I'm I'm with you guys that it's way too early. I do think like if you had to pick something for the last few years that is going to end up being one of those ones that we talk about. Yeah, Balders Gate 3. I think Balders Gate 3 is right next to Elen Ring in like Breath of the Wild for that stuff. I would hope. I just think that that's the type of easier said than done type thing.

You get what I'm saying? Like, but I think it's more will be in the pudding on that one. I think it's more so like depth of writing and how you tackle characters and like how you like tackle RPG interaction. Like Balders Gate 3 is one of the rare RPGs where legitimately I'm like, \"Oh, this is an RPG. This is a game where I feel like I'm actually role- playinging these characters and I'm actually like I feel like I am a character in uh in the story.\" A lot of other video game RPGs almost see like they're role playing as tabletop RPGs, if you know what I mean, where it's like, \"All right, cool.

I can see people trying but like Super Metroid is and Symphony of the Night are impactful because or uh influential because they've influenced other games that like are able to like match that energy and like do things. We'll see. I just think that that's like it might be too good. It might be too much of a a new standard that no one else is going to be able to hit. I think there's not going to be a another Well, I'm not gonna say there's not gonna be another. I think more AAA and more RPGs in general going forward are are going to have to look at Balders's Gate 3 and like their design and like in like all right, how do we make a how do we make an RPG aa RPG that's going to actually live up to the standards that people have now because",

Again, like this is a weird one because it is so early that it it's hard to argue that it belongs on this list, but since they're trying to span up until modern times, I'm not as mad at it. At number 15, we got World of Warcraft. Yep. Makes sense. Makes total sense. Here's the thing. It's like when these pop up and it's like, \"Oh, I don't even need the explanation.\" Yeah, we know.

Only a handful of characters transcend video games. The likes of Sonic, Mario, and Pikachu are almost universally recognized, and Laura Croft belongs on that short list. The intrepid archaeologist was born out of necessity. Designer Toby Guard uh wanted to make an Indiana Jones-like game, but it would have been too costly to create two playable characters. Guard stuck with his preferred choice, and the result was a new gaming icon. As actor Jane Perry explains, quote, \"Lara opened the door for strong female characters in games.

The result was effectively a virtual doll's house that let you set your own goals for your characters. Uh, would you give them a better life or turn their world into a waking nightmare? The Sims expanded the medium's audience, attracting more casual and female players and later providing a safe space for LGBTQ plus players to express themselves.

Modern Warfare that that should be on the list. really should be on the list. Mhm. All right, let's get to number three. All right, and number three, we got Super Mario Brothers. All right, I can't hate this list, dude. Yeah, I can't hate it. They did good. I didn't do the perfect job. You're speaking. You're speaking. You're speaking soon here. I'm a little early. Two more spots left. There's two more spots left. There is. But hey, like I checking all the boxes. They're checking them, man. They're",

So, I feel like with the last couple choices that we just saw, it's like, all right, it sucks that we're not also going to get Breath of the Wild or this or that or whatever, the halos and all that, but it's like I can see what they're trying to do. Yeah, at least we got King Deliverance. Again, not every choice has been perfect, but overall, I think it hit where it needed to hit. And like if you're not going to have a halo on here, which again to me is a little crazy like Doom if you want to take it all the way back, right? Like we were saying at the the top of the show here, Doom fits that mold in terms of Yeah. first person shooter. Yeah. All right. Number one. Number one. We got No [\u00a0__\u00a0]",

Having said that, I knew having said that. I knew I was going to say having said that, y'all don't know. Y'all don't [\u00a0__\u00a0] know. Shenmue was incredibly influential. This game deserves to be on this type of list. This game was so open. You go out there talking to people, getting stories, and all this stuff like so ahead of its time. And I definitely we've heard so many different developers legitimately cite Shenmue as why they make their game design choices and all that stuff. Yes, I think Shenmue deserves a spot on this",

Like there's a lot for Shenmue of like game design where you look at it like playing Shenmue one nowadays, you're like, whoa, they were doing games like this back then? Mhm. There's there's so much here. here. What what do they say about it though? Uh they said a surprise number one in some respects. So yeah, this is definitely ranked. Uh and yet Suzuki's 1999 Opus increasingly feels like the original blueprint for the dynamic detailed settings that we have since become since uh settings that have since become the expected norm at gaming's bleeding edge.

The phrase living, breathing world might be a marketing marketing cliche today, but when Shenmue arrived, it accurately described the game's astonishingly vivid rendition of Yokosuka, where uh Tacernn hero Rio Hazuki searches for his father's killer. And more than anything, this influenced Mega 64 to make one of my favorite Mega 64 sketches of all time. Rocco walking around the streets looking for the man that killed his father. You don't get better than that. That straightforward but absorbing revenge plot paid sec played second fiddle uh to simple pleasures of inhabiting such a convicting urban space with its own timetable.

In both its embrace of a slower paced lifestyle and its use of an in-game clock to dictate the players's activities, it could be seen as a precursor to Animal Crossing or Stardw Valley. The quieter moments and otherwise noisy blockbusters such as Uncharted 4, The Last Part Two, and God of War surely took their cues from Suzuki's game, and its spirit lives on through the increasingly popular Yakuza Like a Dragon series, which similarly encourages uh you to slow down every now and again. Shenmue may have struggled commercially on release, but if it felt out of step with its peers, that's only because it marched to its own leisurely rhythm.

Number one is insane like and more than that like I don't even think I can stand by an argument of top 10. Here's the thing that write up moved me. Yeah. I started tearing up a little bit.
