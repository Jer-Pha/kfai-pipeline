I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the master of hype, Snowback Mike. Hi, Greggy. How are you, Mike? Uh really good. We got a special one today. A great intro as well that'll get you hyped and excited. Sure will. Sure will. Of course. Uh lots to talk about. Lots about what's going on. But as always, hold on one. I got to bust out the big titles. All right. Next to you, Mike, just happens to be Rich Lambert, game director, The Elder Scrolls Online. Hello, Rich. Hello. How are you? I am fantastic. Are you ready for the hard questions? Are you ready for the hard question? Yeah, let's do this. This is going to be fun. And then, of course, joining us, he is studio director, Zenamax Online Studios. It's Matt Fyro. Hey Matt, don't you forget it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do you need to bring your chair up higher again?

A a true partnership here with The Elder Scrolls Online to celebrate, of course, The Elder Scrolls Online's 10th anniversary, our 10th anniversary. Uh we were approached uh by ESO and they said hey you make really good podcasts and we think we have a really good story to tell Mike uh they have a great story you have a great story celebrating 10 years and why not give both together and let's tell a great story about Elder Scrolls Online. Uh so we are doing a 4 episode limited series here on the games cast and of course on Elder Scrolls Online's YouTube channel over there. Uh talking about everything that's happened here.

I can't thank you guys enough for doing this, Rich Matt. Uh, you know, I'm lucky enough to be celebrating 18 years of doing video game journalism, whatever you want to call this, enthusiast press, yelling at people on podcasts, uh, is my career. And the thing I love the most isn't playing the games. It honestly is talking to developers about the things they've created, the passion they get to put into it and the stories behind it.

So I'm really looking forward to getting into this talking about how you all found your way uh to Zos, which I love saying by the way. I didn't know that was how we pronounce it. I didn't know people were boiling it down to Zenax online to Zos. And I was watching the direct the other day. I was like, \"Yes.\" All right, I'm here. Now we're talking about it.

I want to talk about the origins and how this all started, but in terms of where we are in the timeline in reality, what was the big stuff yesterday? What's what's speaking to you?

Uh, just something major, and uh, put it out on in retail, either digital or there was actually retail in 2017. So, so, so there were boxes for you children watching, there used to be brick and mortar stores you'd go to, but so you know, we had a new logo like we called the ESO chapter in 2017 Morwind. So, we had a box that said ESO Morwind with a Morwind symbol and everything. And then in 2018, we came out with Somerset and then elsewhere.

Kind of like an expansion, but you get to go to Morwind, right? in there and it resonates and then the next year was you get to go to Somerset. No one's been to Somerset where the highs are. Sure.

And and and if you look at behind the scenes how how we do the packaging of this stuff, we had about an 18-month runway. 18 months. Yep. Right. 18month runway to do each of these chapters. So, we had two teams kind of um leaprogging over each other a little bit working on these and crossing up and at at certain points um and working on the same thing together. But what it meant was 18 months before we had to look forward and see what people would want to do in a year and a half, right?

Like we had a a bunch of we had a huge cadre of players that would just play through the chapter or go away, come back next June for the next chapter. Totally fine. I I was listening I think you talked to Price about this or maybe it was McCaffrey and you were talking about Yeah. You know this player who shows up and then they're gone for 11 months and then they're back and that's great. Yeah. But now uh it now players are giving us the the the very clear message. This is a little unsatisfying. They love the content, but they want more things to happen over the course of the year. Um and so to do that, we have to change the way that we deliver content to kind of unspool some of the stuff from the giant June",

It could be a a new class. It could be right. It's it doesn't have to be all tied together. And it makes us more flexible. So we can actually react faster and give players what they want without needing to look forward so far. And I'll stop you right there then. So Rich, game director, does this make the job easier or harder? I mean, you don't have to I guess you don't have to anticipate what people are going to want as much, but now you need to turn things quicker, right? Yeah.

It lets us be a lot more reactive, which is good. You know, a lot of times, as Matt said, especially when it comes to building zones, it takes about 18 months to do that. And so, when players give us feedback on the last zone, we've already been hard at work on the next one. Sure. So, it's really the next one that players start to see some of that feedback. So, we want to we want to be able to be more agile in that regard. Were you and I'm assuming you were seeing this feedback from players, right? Of and within the team as well, in the studio as well, right? There's there's when you have to be so far out, you know, in",

When are you going to get it to us? We're like, we're we're doing this thing and this thing and this thing, right? So, um this this helps alleviate some of those. Okay.

And that's what we announced. And it's really cool content. It comes with a lot of cool stuff. It'll just won't happen all at once. Yeah. So, um, we are going to Solstice, which is a a small island kind of on the south corner, uh, of the the map. Uh, and the story is broken up over two major releases. So, the first part comes in in June. There is a giant wall that kind of separates the island. Yeah. Um, which players get to take down together in like this big serverwide event, which will be really, really cool. that opens access to the second half of the And so it's it's a it's our take on this first step of being able to spread the content out a little bit more and give players what they're asking for which is more",

Updating the starter realms things are going on. Yeah. Yeah. Um but yeah, like there's there's all kinds of cool stuff and and you know the the subclassing stuff is really really cool, right? you know, it's going to allow players to continue their the characters that they've started, but able to use skill lines from other classes, so you're not kind of locked into things. So that it went from I think Carrie, who's the systems designer that's been working on the system, it went from something I think there's now over 3,000 possibilities in terms of your class now instead of seven.

But the subasses does get me really excited because as someone who has played mainly tank as a Dragon Knight the whole entire career of VSO, I want to try other classes. I want to be at higher levels and see those cool skills. And so it's exciting to me to be able to jump into that. What does it look like from a player perspective? Is it all unlocked and I can just pick and choose? Do I have to go out and unlock them and play as other classes? Uh, so there's multiple ways that you can do this.

So, we wanted to make sure they could still participate in the system without having to start all over again. And so, there are ways that you can train and learn the skills um on that one particular class. It takes some time, but so does leveling classes to 50. So, yeah, but people are used to putting the time in, right? That's the whole point about living in being in the world and learning. That's right.

Like what a great idea, of course, to bring it back to these worms. Yeah. Yeah. So, so, so the season is actually called uh Seasons of the Worm Cold. And uh that's a name that is immediately uh uh known by everyone that's played ESO because the main story in the launch version of the game, the very first story that we told was the story of the worm cult and Manamarco and uh and Moolik Balls invading uh invading Tamriel.

So, so basically if you play ESO, everything happens in the game at the same time. So, and it just makes things easier to explain story-wise. And you like like Rich said, your character experiences things in the order they experience it in. Not necessarily the true for every character.

You'll see us even watching a doing a direct reacting to the Xbox developer director or something. You come up, it's well, it's not, but it is, but it isn't. But it I need a whiteboard in about 20 minutes. All right. So, the easiest way to explain is explained how we evolved. So, so um uh in 2007, um I was hired to start Zenamax Online Studios.

So, Bethesda Softworks was our publisher, right? So, we're all studios that then Bethesda Softworks uh published. So, people get hung up a lot even now, even today over Bethesda Game Studios versus Bethesda Softworks versus Enamax Media versus Enamax Online.

Was there ever discussion after Skyrim of having so much freedom in the player of choosing what they want to be at any moment? Was there that move of, hey, you know, MMOs are usually tank, healer, DPS. Let's move away from that. We're kind of seeing that with subasses now, which is very exciting. But back then, was there a moment of like, hold up, maybe we give the player all the freedom in the world to do whatever they want. Yeah. Yeah. We talked a lot about that. Yeah. and and and we're skipping over so many massive things that are involved in that in that in that in that question which was how do we forget this like you can pick up any weapon or armor in the world and use it, right?

That's what we called them. Yeah, the click turns. We ended up hiring almost all of them full-time after they were interns. But yeah, they basically went through every container in the world and made them lootable like Yeah. Yeah. Like Yeah, it's it was it is ridiculous that you were able to do this so quickly cuz it sounds like just making a completely different game. Well, we had the space. The space didn't change, right?

All we had to change were your systems, the character systems for interacting with those things. Gosh. Which is h kind of half of the the equation. No big deal. Half. And I mean, we had to rewrite a lot of quests, but that was more from the how do you turn just great walls of text, pages of text into spoken dialogue that is interesting and easy to digest. How did you nail the zones? We talk about the other half now. How did we, you know, throw the dart and say that's the scope of the game right there. This is how many zones. This is the last.

So, there's a zone called Storm Haven where anyone any player of VSO knows Storm Haven. If you go into Storm Haven, it's actually, if you look at it closely, it's a lot different than most of the other zones. And it's because it was the zone. It's the zone that we tried to make all the the content model work. And we must have redone that thing, I swear, seven times. Uh or more. Yeah. The the the affectionate nickname for for the game was Warrior and uh Warrior and Storm Haven because we only had the Warrior and we only had Storm Haven and we were trying to prove that the game was fun and interesting.

The first version of all the zones we actually made the mistake of having five teams do five different zones. We ended up with five different games. Yeah. Go these there's no there's nothing connected. Yeah, we learned we learned a lot right in in doing all of that kind of stuff and and a lot of it was us just playing and going this doesn't work. Bulldo it start again. Well, this doesn't work. Try another model. And it was it was not necessarily like the quests themselves cuz storytelling is kind of storytelling.

If you don't have an NPC chasing you down right in your face, it's not an over sports game. We fixed Stugga. But but yeah. Yeah, we there's a uh um a POI quest in Storm Haven called Pariah Abbey, which was our that's where we came up with our POI quest system.

So like how do you account for that? We had to learn all that concept. Yeah. Figure it all out. I'm so thankful we have a lot of time. I was going to say fascinated by zones and how the player moves and we're coming up on an hour. I promised them 45 minutes. So, but it's been too good. I do.

Um and game design isn't a perfect science, right? It's it's a lot of trial and error. It's making mistakes. It's learning.
