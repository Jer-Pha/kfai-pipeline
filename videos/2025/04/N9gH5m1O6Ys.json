What's going on? Well, you guys are doing games daily or no, games cast. Nick's like, \"What if we did topics again?\" I was like, \"Oh, okay.\" So, give me 15 minutes until the podcast starts. We'll get fun stuff to talk about. Of course, rounding out the quartet on this podcast is Roger Pakornney. You know, my biggest fan. I'm your biggest fan. My whole family is your biggest fan. Stop.

In Imperial, you play as a mercenary sent to a distant planet to discover the mysteries of an ancient civilization. Powers unknown lie within the monolith, but those are no mere ruins, as an expedition has already ventured inside with only a few survivors. Why was it built? What powers reside within? Who is at the center of the monolith? All these secrets and more will be uncovered if you are brave enough to take on Imperial. Imperial features a unique blend of RPG systems and skill-based combat across three weapon archetypes.

Whenever he can spend time with his kid, he goes out of his way to try to do that.

That's like how little my dad was in my life. Again, Luke Scarpino, great guy, great father, love him.
