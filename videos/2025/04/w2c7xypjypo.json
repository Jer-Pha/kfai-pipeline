Good morning. It was It's weird to be at these desks doing the podcast cuz it's like, \"Oh, I can't hear you.\" Look over there. You can see that Nick's over there, but he's not wearing the headphones. Maybe I won't. No, you don't really need to wear the headphones in this room. I know. If you want, you can. True. You should wear the head. I'm wearing the headphones. Why are we wearing the headphones? Why would Well, I wore them all day during the stream yesterday and didn't have any game audio and it classic. Not that you really need audio for schedule one, but it made me laugh. Is there not So, wait. Is there no game audio? There is game audio, but you don't really need it.

Greg ran in. All right, first off, the stream goes down. Oh, and then unrelated. And then Greg runs in and goes, \"No big deal. It's not a huge deal, but part of the building next door is just a little bit on fire.\" And I'm like, \"What [\u00a0__\u00a0] briefcase is going to come out now?\" And cuz I I can't Tim was already out of the office.

Uh one of the update photos I had. Should I pull up a photo? No, I don't think so. Right. No, smoke building out of a building. It's not that impressive. It's just like there's a lot of fire trucks.

And so, the way I understand it is that like basically the power needs to be shut down to do that. And the power that that would be on is on the studios fuse box, whatever you call it. Yep. Yeah.

One, we don't have sprinklers out there or any sort of water irrigation system, which is fine for the uh aloe vera plants that our neighbors lovingly cut just by the door so that they can make their own presumable alo aloe vera lotions or whatever they're doing. Those don't those don't need water necessarily, but I'm pretty sure an orange tree does need water to grow.
