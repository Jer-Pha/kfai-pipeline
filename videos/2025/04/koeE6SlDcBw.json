But uh yeah, that was a little tough. That that one was longer. That was an endurance trial yesterday because we had started the day off uh by having a quick little pow-wow and we like when are we going to uh when are we going to stop this? And I was like 4 4:30ish and we all got to 4:45 and we were like in for a penny, in for a pound. Yeah, that was a lot of Pokemon, but we made some really good headway.

That seems Well, when it's a quarter of the price of the console, it does seem like it's a bit crazy. Okay. Well, it does seem like that's the new world we're slipping into.

To me, that's an that's an, you know, acceptable that's currently the world that we live in where free-to-play games kind of rule the market and uh, a lot of other games have great sales or sometimes they struggle. But we are currently seeing a Nintendo who has come out and said, \"Hey, Mario Kart, that's $80.\" That that sounds kind of crazy.
