Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Benella. Um, and uh, he wore a suit on an airplane because he thought he heard saw a Tik Tok that if you wear a suit on an airplane, they're going to move your seat and give you like first class, which not true.

Always trying to get something for free. Yeah. No, he's he's he's exact. He's definitely my brother. But the entire time we were together, I I felt like such an old person.

I've been buying this one a lot. Here's my problem with the line of questioning from Game Showdown. Um, first off, anybody getting mad at me for not understanding that question and not knowing the answer, I played Securiro 3 years ago. And not only did I play it, I streamed it, which already puts me at an even more of a disadvantage for information penetrating the brain. You're entertaining. You're entertaining.

So the it's the way that the questioning was happening that I feel was like a little bit maybe unintentionally sinister by blessing to say in the Sangoku era whatever for that not to be a word for him to omit but then to go Japanese waring factions blah blah blah in the land of blank can't say that word Andy cuz it's a spoiler and you were like sushiva I'm like well I don't know what the you know if Sangoku is not enough of a spoiler, but this blank word is too much of a spoiler. I I I can't think too hard about this and go with something else cuz if it's Ghost of Sushima, I'm going to hate myself. Yeah. Yeah.

No, but like honestly, if he left he left in the word that didn't give you the answer, but he left out the word that would have given you the answer. Honestly, if he cut off the prompt too soon, if he cut off the prompt sooner, I maybe would have guessed Seiro and been like, \"Yeah, it's like it's this is a question.\" But but when you do in the land of blank too much of a spoiler, but how is like like then don't say Sang Goku or come up with a different game with no like I got to omit this word. Chat also says to be fair, Sang Goku era isn't when Ghost of Sushima takes place. Yeah, but how the [\u00a0__\u00a0] do I know that? Like how the [\u00a0__\u00a0] do I know",

Smoke them if you got them. Minecraft surpasses $720 million at the global box office. Now, it did get taken down by Sinners over the weekend domestically, which is great for Cougler and Co. Yeah.

Um, not tech not technically, but he is. Uh, he would be perfect for a Gears of War movie because Gears of War needs to have most it needs to mostly be a uh space version of Saving Private Ryan.

This was just like a test thing that they did and they released it and said, \"Here's the trailer for the movie.\" And it was never in actually in production. So yeah, we're never getting it.

I think there's a lot of other franchises that can be done by, you know, Phil Lord and and Miller, but obviously they're really busy with Spider-Man.
