Uh, you know, I think there was a lot of talk last week about the choices they had made and the differences from the game and that there and I think one of the things we kept talking about last week was them fleshing things out and so really getting to sit with a lot of the different moments here I thought were incredibly powerful and unexpected and as you've said this is spoiler we're all we're spoiling everything but you know that scene of Tommy sitting there cleaning Joel and then the only thing he says is give my love to Sarah like come on. You know what I mean? Ellie waking up in the hospital screaming, let alone her scene with the doctor. Come on. Just the way Ellie says Abby at the kitchen table when Dena tells her her name.

But this is another amazing episode and example of them taking the source material that we all love so much and expanding on it in so many simple, maybe even silent ways to make it feel so much different and even more impactful. Yeah. Uh I I found this one very very emotional. I get that that's the point, but like I can't remember a time I've watched a episode of TV that like I had this like tense feeling of like almost crying. Like I didn't actually cry watching it, but like I felt that like intense emotion the entire time. Like I thought they did a really good job diving deeper into the grieving of Joel where we just don't get that in the game. Like I feel like the game uh the",

But here's sitting with it a bit longer and like even just seeing it uh in live action like seeing her in the the dust covered room and like going up to Joel's jacket and like putting against her face like this was just incredibly emotional episode. I think they did a fantastic job and I this is my favorite type of episode of Last of Us which is it is so true to the spirit of the game but it is majority new stuff but like I I want that I played the game. I love the game. getting more different things I think is uh very good for it. And they continue to impress me with the switched up dynamics like the changes uh with Dena and Ellie.

I think this is more like, you know, the the fallout from what happened and then really resetting the grander story of of of uh Ellie going on her revenge trip right there. I I thought the uh the great scene for me, the the one I I I really kind of walked away thinking, \"Wow, that was that was great,\" was the council scene where they actually, you know, they sat and they they had that debate, which you're having internally as an audience member because we all know you should just let this go, right? There's nothing good that can come of this. And and almost gets to that point as well until Seth stands up and is like, \"Hey, what? You guys are [\u00a0__\u00a0] crazy. Like, they're",

They're coming back, right? and they're going to come back for us and they're going to take more and more and more. Uh, so he's got that old militant mentality. Yeah. Um, but other than that, I thought it was good and I'm looking forward to I mean, I like the I like the ending moment, too, where we have we have them being like, \"Oh, maybe there's not that many wolves left.\" And then they're just like a [\u00a0__\u00a0] battalion of of wolves marching through the streets just murdering people. Uh, looking forward to it. I have questions for you guys, though.

Hit me. because I I it's been years since I've played The Last of Us Part Two and so I do want to check in and see like which parts of this are from the game and which parts aren't from the game. I mean, yeah, it's because the cult of this is just straight up not from the game. Sarapites are, but like not this group of Sarapites. We're getting more earlier backstory for them, which I think is again a great call. Like even just having that scene of them, we know so much from so little of just having them like we know that there's a prophet. We know that the it's not even so much like they're crazy believing in this prophet. It's more like the idea of it and this like fatherdaughter situation having them massacred. I just didn't expect that, you know, I didn't expect to I thought we were going to sit with them a little longer, but I think that's it's really powerful to set up the dynamics of the WLF and them and then also we have um you know",

It's very cool. Yeah. And again, I think that was one of the powerful things they did here was introducing us to the Sarapites, the scars that early, right? And and have them do it in a non-aggressive aggression way where I think the game, even though obviously we can sit there and be like, \"Oh, I understand the motivations of the WLF. I understand the motivations of the Sarah fights.\" Both of them are introduced in a way so late that it's like, well, you're bad guys. You're, you know, and you are. Yes, we can all talk and have the conversation about them being the same as the people from Jackson, right? But I feel like they lost their humanity in in the video game. They were more obstacles.

And like you're saying the father and the daughter. Well, can I have a hammer? Sure. This. What about the prophet? and him really explaining what they do and why they do it and then showing them be afraid and them run and hide in monster or monsters and wolves. It was like damn, I can only imagine watching this for the first time and be like who the [\u00a0__\u00a0] are any of these people? But then also like you're not looking at them as oh these are guys who need to get their heads kicked in because they're they're crazy. It's like no no like they're just trying to make it in this world like everybody else is. I thought that was really well done. Yeah,",

I thought that was really well done. Yeah, you see them at at first with the scars on their faces. You see you see obviously like the more religious sort of garb that they're wearing and your first thought I think at least my first thought was like oh right this is a religious cult. They're going to be crazy. They're going to be like human sacrifices or whatever. I don't remember what they were in the game and I know they were antagonists. Um and then you have that good conversation where she's like well the prophet says this and the dad kind of breaks it down. He goes well prophets aren't like gods. They're not all knowing. They're just people that believe in an ideal and they like help people you know toward that and that's why we call them prophets. And I'm like well that's such a grounded. Oh no you're all dead.

You know, and then we have the one that that moment where, you know, Ellie and and Dina catch up with them and it's just a slaughter and you see and they even show you the dead kid. You're like, \"What do we come on?\" Yeah. Drman, what do we do, Neil? Come on. Um, but I thought that same thing too with that moment of like them whistling and explaining and him quizzing her on what it means. Like that's just a neat little part of the lore in the back building that of course playing the game we all understood that's what they were doing, but to really see them have that language is cool. I love that. I really love that cuz Yeah. I I think that how the game introduces them is terrifying. Like the whistle is just such a good device to like make",

Like the whistle is just such a good device to like make you feel that fear as a gamer. Like you don't know what they're saying. Yeah. Exactly. And quickly it's like oh they're hunting me. Like that's crazy. Uh but in this Yeah. Like seeing them kind of be able to like communicate with each other and then actually translate it. I was like, \"This is such a fascinating um expansion on what we already know about these people.\" Cuz like even the again, it's been years since I played it, so I'm very hazy on like the details of two, but I loved the profit stuff. Like I feel like that some of it felt a little side storyish where you had to like find like the different clues and stuff about it. But I I'm happy that it seems like they're going to dive deeper into it here because uh to Greg's point earlier, it's like they're introduced late enough in the game",

So by the end when it's just like a big ass war between everybody, it kind of just feels like noise as opposed to like groups that we care about. And I don't need characters specifically. Like I already care about them as a group more than I did in the game, which I think is again a testament to them taking their time on the show and allowing it to dive deeper into different uh directions. Yeah. And it's character development, right? I mean, you have to have that for a narrative show. Again, this is a passive experience that we're watching. We're not playing these moments. And I was I remember as they were sort of approaching Seattle, um I remember having those moments where you have to do some of the platforming, some of the walking",

And I and I remember all that stuff, but so much of that is not story. That's all game mechanic. That's all the immersion of you being in this world and having to explore it and being scared and and and being in those moments. But I do think they're doing a a big service really fleshing out all these characters. Even Jackson, like all the council, all these characters. I like I literally the therapist. I mean, Catherine here, come on. Come on. What are you talking about? Come on. Her drinking at the little league game. So good. Just so good. Not even that far out. I'm like, you're going to catch a stray here. Um, but I I just I I find it I think it's really smart and I think it's really interesting from just, you know,",

And so I watch this and I go, I could be in this town more. I could see I I care about the inner workings now of these characters. I care about what happened with the therapist's husband and between her and Joel. I'm sure we'll get that story at some point later down the road. Um, but that's really that that's an immersion on a very subtle and and and very good path for me that I feel like I'm I'm I'm very much looking forward to watching the next few episodes of the show. Yeah. I mean, I think that uh just the dynamics of Jackson are so much more interesting and I feel like they're true to this again the spirit of the game where we just didn't get much Jackson, but now it's like I feel like this enhances my idea of even game Jackson where",

Where did you like him when he took his sleeveless he took his shirt off and he had those giant arms? I was like, \"Whoa, Jesus. This guy get these arms from.\" But Tommy continues to be another highlight for me of like the the changes they make with him, I feel make it a a more compelling real story. Like, uh, I I love the idea of the game of him immediately going after Joel, that makes sense, too. But I think with the the version of Tommy we have here and the version of Joel we have here, having the the back and forth dialogue between uh Ellie and Tommy where he's like, you know, she's my he was my brother. Like, I know him. I know him. Don't think I don't know Joel. Yeah. And I heard like, \"Don't talk",

And I heard like, \"Don't talk to me. Don't talk to me like I didn't know him.\" That's one of the quotes I jotted down cuz I was so good stuff. Like I think that that that was really great. And this version of Ellie, like I love that this whole episode uh like the theme of her was she's lying. You know what I mean? Like she lies. They call her a liar and like they had that conversation about like people can lie and not be liars and she's like, \"No, no, no. She's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] liar.\" You can agree to disagree here, which I appreciate. Yeah. And what I love about it is like we see her straight up lie multiple times throughout the the episode like with She starts off the episode by lying. Yeah. I mean the patio thing, right? It's like we know we're getting the [\u00a0__\u00a0] patio scene. We know that she went to go see him. I I hope at",

We know that she went to go see him. I I hope at least, right? Like there's no way that that's true. Uh that she just didn't see him. So that and then also just like her feelings with Dena. Like I think that they added layers to it where Dena being all in on Ellie and them being all in together uh in Seattle day one in the game. That's cool and that works, but I think this Dena is way more fascinating. And I like that they're still kind of playing this like not will they won't they, but they're they're they're kids that are trying to figure out their feelings for each other. They both clearly are into each other, but they're like they want the other person to make the first move. You know what I mean? Yeah.

O too much. Too much moisture. Um, but yeah, even the opening shots of of Tommy, like of them cleaning Joel's body and then Tommy coming in, it's like, \"Oh my god, that is like it's gut-wrenching, you know?\" And um I I feel like just it the game I think did such a great job of having us go into Joel's house and be able to like see everything and like it had this like empty feeling where it's like it that hit so hard cuz like even though we didn't explore that house in the the first game or anything, we didn't really have ties to that house.

Like it was so clear how much Joel meant to Jackson and how much Jackson lost with Joel dying, but also them in the council bringing up the whole thing of like it wasn't just Joel that died. Like so many people died. And I just think that it adds a lot of weight to the the context of Ellie's journey. This is the power, right, of the format where when we're the video game, uh, and I know in this this one game we are not, but for this everything we're talking about, you are right. You're on sticks is Ellie, so everything has to be from Ellie's perspective.

In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith, accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams. Each cardoggram affects which enemies, boss fights, and loot will appear when you enter the monolith, so no two excursions will be the same. Find even more cardoggrams to explore by looting defeated enemies, or buy them from other players online at the trading post. You'll need to make sure you have the right gear to take on the harder Cardiggrams. Build your mercenary, choose your gear, master your abilities, and take down everything in your path in Imperial.

I haven't fully, you know, we're just exploring. It's a very explorational like let's start some stuff.

But I I I think that Dean has been thinking about that kiss with Ellie the whole time. I think she she's gayer than she's saying. And then my other question is for you.

This is going to end badly. In Ellie's speech today, uh, you know, in front of the town council, she says something about, you know, not thinking it's gotten into her trouble before and some things you can't take back or you can't undo or whatever is similar to what she was talking about with Katherine Nhara.

And it's mainly just like a sign of their the little moments of Last of Us that make it so special between the two of And I I I I I love it because it just shows that that's how Ellie thinks of Joel.

Great stuff indeed. Um any other thoughts? I think we kind of touched on everything here. No, dude. Shout out to um Bella the Bella Ramsay's performance. The opening shots of her waking up and just [\u00a0__\u00a0] screaming. Screaming. Dude, that was crazy, man. It's uh I liked her and I liked the little not I'm not going to say it's like a full redemption arc for Seth. I think that the homophobe, the guy who's always the [\u00a0__\u00a0] bad guy or bad cop. He's always a bad guy. He might have actually been a bad cop in Bosch at one point, too. Um this guy's great though cuz you can tell he's seen the final season. Um I liked it. I like the handshake.

What I appreciate about it though is how it fits so well into the Last of Us world where I don't necessarily see it as a redemption arc. I see it more as like people are complicated and they could be bad and good at the same time. And I I feel like I I liked Seth where to me like I feel like even his speech uh in the council it's not necessarily coming from a good place.

They should not be like I know what this I know what this show is, but in my brain I wanted them to lose the vote vote and then her therapist sign be like why don't we just talk before you go out on this because this is going to be you're to your destruction. You're going to take yourself. But I I thought that they did a good job of like having Seth come off like I don't think he came off well. You know what I Like I would want to side with that guy giving the speech that he gave. You know what I mean? But also those people exist and those people exist for good reason to an extent.

But if there really is a group out there and remember these people don't know why they attacked, right? They're not they're not sure why Joel's dead. I don't think Ellie was out there being like, \"Well, let me tell you this crazy ass backstory as to what happened and take take a look at this cigar and all these things, right?\" So, they don't really know. So, on on a certain level, if you've been through all this [\u00a0__\u00a0] they've been through, there's an argument to be made that there is a group of another faction out there that's testing the fence of Jackson and we maybe need to go push back on them before they come at us full tilt.

But it's it's it's it's interesting. It's an interesting conundrum. Greg, I hear you. I agree. You know, I think I like Tim's summation of people are complicated. I think that's the thing where, you know, start and I know I'm dialing back a little bit in terms of the conversation, but I think that's what works for me. And then, yeah, this is a fun argument to have, of course, because it's easy for us to sit there and know that, well, no, Abby means you no harm, right? She came. Now, of course, it is different. one of the, you know, one of her compatriots there could come back and say, \"Hey,",

If you're doing laundry uh Chandre Scholar in the chat says, \"What do you think about Tommy staying behind staying behind in Jackson?\" There's not a freaking way he's not he doesn't leave. He's leaving. The second you find out that Ellie and Dina are gone, he's got to go. Yeah. I mean, again, I think that this the the show version of Ellie, like I feel like the the guilt that she has to deal with, I I feel like they they did such a good job setting up Jackson as a community that we care about.

Like, I think there's just even more guilt that's going to be on her shoulders when things go bad potentially like at Jackson. I don't know we'll ever even see that necessarily, but like I I think that the concept of her turning her back on the people, especially after they just had this brutal [\u00a0__\u00a0] attack and the wall being destroyed, like I think that that's good storytelling. It's different than the game, but yeah, Tommy's going after for sure. You think Tommy and Jesse? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. That was the squad kind of in the game, right? It I don't remember where. Yes. Right.

Jesse come after them because they left. Tommy's first cuz Tommy Tommy and Ellie were talking. Oh, is he? I thought Jesse first. Oh, maybe. And then Jesse and Well, no. Cuz Tommy and Ellie were having I correct me if I'm wrong. Tommy and Ellie had a conversation. Ellie's like, \"We got to [\u00a0__\u00a0] go.\" And he's like, \"Give me give us till tomorrow.\" And then he leaves early. Tomorrow's age 21st, Dina and Elliot, and then Jesse follows. Gotcha.
