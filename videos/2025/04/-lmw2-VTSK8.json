We've had to miss the last couple weeks due to people being out and scheduling and stuff. So, we did not get to talk about episode seven, eight, or nine, but here we are talking about our thoughts on all three, focusing on the finale and the season overall. Uh, because that's what we do here at Kind of Funny. We like to talk about the things that we like and don't like about all the things that we love. Uh, you can get all of that on YouTube or Twitch watching live. You can also get it later as a podcast. If you get the kind of funny membership, you get the show's ad free and you get a daily exclusive Gregway. You can also be a super cool Patreon producer like Anatoli asked, Delaney Twining, Carl Jacobs, and Omega Buster. A little housekeeping for you. We are an 11person business all about live talk shows.

Real excited. And then uh we have the Daredevil spoilercast we're doing right now. And after this, we get into a super fun stream. It's GTFO with the devs. That's exciting, Greg. It is. Andy talked about this on the Games Cast we just did, of course, that what's cool about this is yes, we've done a lot of sponsor stuff lately, which is cool because of course, thank you for sponsoring and keeping the dream alive.

Uh, you can also get today's Gregway if you're a kind of funny member. It's 15 minutes all about if Stars in the Bank is real. Is it real, too? Let me tell you, it's real. Is it real? Let me tell you, it's real. I don't I'm not even sure what it is, but I know it's real. It's definitely real. Today, we're brought to you by Imperial Factor and Shady Rays, but we'll tell you all about that later. Let's get into it. The topic of the shows, Daredevil.

Daredevil born again is now over. Andy Cortez, I feel like we missed you on this even before the um the last couple weeks that we missed overall. So, where you at with Daredevil and what your thoughts on the finale? I love the season. I love the show. I think the the finale had some moments that I was still excited about, but kind of like had to go, uh, I don't love the way they did that. But everything else is still so great, and everything else is playing out so incredibly, and I love these characters so much, and I love their interactions that I I still really love this episode of TV.

Um, but seeing him back in the suit, seeing the action sequences, I would I could have gone for one or two more big action sequences throughout the whole season, but overall I'm still very happy with it and even more excited for season two. Uh, and remember YouTube can YouTube super chat in your thoughts on the show, what you liked, what you didn't like, everything in between. Greg Miller, what did you think of the finale? Uh, I'm right there with Andy. Uh, Tim, I loved this season. Uh, enjoyed it, was excited for it every time.

Not to a point where it ruined the season for me or I wouldn't recommend you watch or d it was one of those that when it ended it was you echoing my ears from earlier in the day where somebody's mentioned something you're like well remember this was supposed to be one season they broke it in half and it's like oh I think that's painfully obvious here where I don't think it's a strong finale cliffhanger. I think a lot of the thing the I think we jump to some pretty extraordinary things happening here that are like da da da like I have a lot to say in terms of I think maybe we should rip Muse out of it and let some of these things actually go and breathe a bit more",

Yeah, spoiler cast. Just seeing Punisher and Daredevil there. You ready? read and like come the [\u00a0__\u00a0] on Johnny Burnthal Nick. I had a great time. Nicholas. Yeah. Overall, I really enjoyed uh the whole series. Um I I'm with uh Greg and Andy here, though. I do think it started to wne a little bit toward the last couple episodes. And I think as they pushed toward that cliffhanger, I found myself just wanting two more episodes to to really kind of wrap this whole thing up. I think it was a bit rushed with Kingpin's sort of turn. Uh, it makes sense, but I I really do feel like they we we we slow played",

Um, I just feel like, wow, we've really kind of jumped the the shark hero a little bit. Um, and and I I honestly feel like the the Daredevil Punisher thing was a little bit lacking. I think some of the the action sequences toward the last couple episodes weren't as good as the first few. Um, and that's unfortunate because you obviously want to see those action sequences sort of ramp up in creativity. Uh, but I always love seeing John Bernthal and I love where he's like I like the line where he was like power goes out. You ain't got [\u00a0__\u00a0] to make coffee here. I'm like that that hits",

I think that like element to element and episode to episode um there were many great moments and I just feel like overall it kind of doesn't say with me it's like oh man this is the best thing ever. This is the best Disney Plus show even I wouldn't say. No. Um and uh is it one of the better finales? I'd say so, but it's not the best finale. And I feel like finale, right?

Um, and I feel like that's the thing where not knowing exactly what was happening where, from who and all that, but now knowing and seeing it, I'm like, \"Oh, clearly you guys had to just try to make the stuff all work.\" And I I think that there was multiple stories being told that were very intriguing. And I just don't think that they like crushed the landing on most of them. And some of them didn't land. Some of them we are still working. We have season 2 next year.

But it felt like it happened very very quickly. And I think that the Vanessa Fisk uh therapist stuff really didn't go where I wanted it to. And I think it kind of just meandered a lot until they're finally back together and I'm like, \"All right, cool. The show's starting now.\" Um, and I I sound very negative on this. Overall, I I really really really enjoyed it. I just don't think it in terms of quality was that the gold standard that I was really expecting from from Daredevil.

Uh the team up between them is awesome, but I think the speech didn't hit the way it needed to. They cut away from it way too much. I feel like there was moments that needed to just be the moment and they kind of made them just part of other moments and that really that let me down and uh the only thing let me down more was we need an army and it's like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] I was like, \"Are they going Spider-Man?\" All the vigilantes that were like, \"Yeah, who are the vigilantes that are left in New York?\" They play the Spider-Man MCU theme song when he says, \"We're building building an army.\" Maybe that's a coincidence, but like somebody should have checked.

Now Tim, I think one thing I want to ask you about undercooked moments and I think something that could have really really resonated and hit extremely hard. That didn't for me because I don't think it was cooked well enough throughout the whole season because when the White Tiger episode ends, emotional is all hell. I'm sad.

But then as he is looking at the cop and going you oh you recognize these bullet casings, right? Yeah, I [\u00a0__\u00a0] know what you did to white tiger. You killed him. Blah blah blah. And then they have those little cutbacks to uh the white tiger. I'm blanking on the character Hector and they cut to and those are usually the most easy things for me to feel. I'm just such a sucker for [\u00a0__\u00a0] like that. Even if they aren't even well paced out, I usually get hit really hard by those little just kind of flashbacks to the murder and just him with his and you know being found innocent in court and all that stuff.

And I want it clear like I'm not saying like, oh, the we got to build an army, whatever. I'm not disappointed we didn't see Spider-Man and Doctor Strange and the whole goddamn Avengers show up in this thing.

One or two more big hallway fights could have done it for me. And maybe two or three more moments of him in a church talking to a dude. You got to have that. I need a monologue, Nick.

And then we don't see him again for many episodes. We we hear about Muse, but even we don't even hear about him until like four episodes later. Yeah, I'll say this. This reminds me a lot structurally and thinking about the what could have been to us watching Falcon Winter Soldier, but I think this was still a better end product of enjoying the show more.

Yeah, I mean that does make sense because yeah, I feel like the MU stuff did was going to be the main course and then they just had to make it kind of just like a plot, not even a Bplot, just like a plot within the the major plot going on. I think that did a major disservice to the character of Muse and even to the pacing of this season overall and the quality of it. I followed none of the behind the scenes stuff. Why did they have to change that? Because they shot an entire season where that was the focus and then they're like, \"Oh, wait.

It was that Kingpin Daredevil or Matt Murdoch scene sitting there talking, right? But then I started getting to other combinations that I just didn't like as much where even we said it earlier like well the the Frank Matt confrontation in his bunker the first time episodes ago was great. This one I enjoyed it but again something wasn't perfect about it. I don't know what it was. It was too rushed. And so that's the thing is",

I mean I thought the show rocked until it sort of fell apart near the end because of it was clear that co really [\u00a0__\u00a0] up a lot of the writing and that's what this show kind of seeming to have a DNA and this show was going to have its own identity and then kind of getting ripped apart by other outside reasons. that those are the same kind of vibes I had where I could see the seams of oh this was probably different here but whatever happened you know that but that happens a lot with shows in general I think that Falcon Winter Soldier problem we had and correct me if I'm wrong but this was where we were like these are the weakest like antagonists out of any show right",

But this we had strong antagonists. We had all the dynamics of the characters that needed to be there. They just didn't and I hate to use the term, but they just didn't stick the landing in my opinion. I feel like we get we move our leads of Kingpin and Matt Murdoch to their respective corners and like Matt's got Karen, which I just don't buy.

I thought that was and then getting shot like all of that stuff was great. It's just I'm a little sick of Daredevil like being in a situation where it's like homie you are dead and then being able to come back next episode with Yeah. with I was just thinking about it right now. I'm just like I was about to make a joke of just like why why the [\u00a0__\u00a0] would you ever say Karen? You should at least",

Like, what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] are we doing sometimes with this goddamn show? Bring back Electra, though. I don't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] Find some way.

But our favorite when he gets into the apartment all by himself walking he just walks out of the hospital after he's been shot and Punisher is there. I was like wow what an incredible missed opportunity to have Punisher save him in the hospital to have Punisher have a moment where he's like I'm so I can't get out of this [\u00a0__\u00a0] bed and",

He's like what's up Red? You know, some [\u00a0__\u00a0] like that would have been cool for me, but instead we get an interesting conversation about coffee in their apartment and then that sequence. Well, we can't kill Buck. He's so important. God forbid. He's so important to the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Come on. I feel like we're being for next season. I feel like I can already see the comments and there's like, oh, you guys are so negative on this. Again, I enjoyed the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of all. Had a great time. Had a great time.

I just don't think it was that good because of a lot of the reasons that I explained and a lot of reasons I had were different than the reasons y'all had. disjointed seasoned Born Again season 1.
