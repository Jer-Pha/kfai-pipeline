Fair enough. But then, you know, I go down the list and there's Shadow Colossus.

You can get 30 points right now. 30 more points on top of your 10 points. You can get four times the points for the next round if you get the next question correct over Andy and Tim. That would be four times the points. You take the points, right? Or you can open the secret chest that has a secret warden. Oh, [\u00a0__\u00a0] I never got to do the secret chest last time.

The true gamer of kind of funny. It is Greg Miller for team blue with 80 points. Angry Greg voice. Tim, if you can't even show up for work, you don't deserve these stars. But Chicago still loves you. Oh, you know what? I played Sakiro with the Japanese dubs. That's what Yeah, that's what it was. That's what it was. That's exactly what it was. That's what it was. Barrett has up here the star tracker. Of course, coming into this episode, team orange was dominant with six stars, team purple uh had one star, and team blue had three. Of course, performance this episode brings Team Blue up to four stars. This is humongous cuz now when I cash in Stars in the Bank before the next episode, cuz I have to apparently before the end of the season. When I do that, I get three stars. That puts me in the lead. I have seven stars.",

Technically, if you get one star, that puts you at tide with Tim. Yeah, but with the three I go to leave. I don't know. Six of you have six. Greg has four right now. If he gets one, if he gets one of your stars. Oh, that brings you down to five. That would bring Greg up to five. Don't worry, there'll be a bunch of stupid categories. That thing is still more bomber jacket. God, give it to me. We'll figure it out when we get there. Uh, ladies, gentlemen, MBs, thank you guys so much for hanging out with us during this episode of Game Showdown, your nerdy trivia show. We'll be back next time with the season finale.
