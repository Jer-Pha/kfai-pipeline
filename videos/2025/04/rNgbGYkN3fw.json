Find even more cardoggrams to explore by looting defeated enemies or buy them from other players online at the trading post. You'll need to make sure you have the right gear to take on the harder cardiggrams. Build your mercenary, choose your gear, master your abilities, and take down everything in your path in Imperial.

In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith, accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams. Each card affects which enemies, boss fights, and loot will appear when you enter the monolith. So, no two excursions will be the same. Find even more cardiggrams to explore by looting defeated enemies or buy them from other players online at the trading post. You'll need to make sure you have the right gear to take on the harder cardiggrams. Build your mercenary, choose your gear, master your abilities, and take down everything in your path in Imperial.
