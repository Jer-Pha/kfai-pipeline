And it has been far too long since the Ahsoka uh screencast breakdowns we have done. We are returning for Andor season 2. Of course, I'm your host, Tim Gettys. I'm joined today by Barrett Courtourtney. Tim, it's been way too goddamn long talking about Star Wars. Having Sage back on kind of funny content, having Carboni back. Oh, he's not here today. Why? He has to be in Japan to host Star Wars Celebration, you know? Whoop-dedoo. 10 years of doing Star Wars Celebration. Who the hell does he think? Gosh. Like, he doesn't understand the importance of Andor. andor season 2 episodes 1 through three. We had to be here. Sage, welcome back. How are you doing? I am so good. I am Well, I'm I have a fever. So, if my voice sounds funny, it's because I'm only standing by the power and motivation of Andor season 2 and also seeing my friends. I love it. I love it. So happy to have you back.",

So happy to have you back. Here's the deal, everybody. Uh Andor season 2 is a show absolutely worth watching. I want all of you to watch this show. So, if you're not watching the show, you should. If you've watched it, watch it again. We got to support things like this. And here's the other deal. Because of how they're releasing this, three episodes a week for the next four weeks. Very cool because each week is going to cover one year leading into Rogue One, which of course then leads into Star Wars: A New Hope. Um, but three full 50inute dense episodes of prestige television a week is very complicated to cover. Uh, Tony Gilroy, the showrunner himself was like, \"Hey, I love that this is happening, but I feel bad for the podcasters.

We're trying to get the four of us as often as possible to talk about all these uh shows, but of course that's going to come with a lot of inconsistencies week to week. So, just letting y'all know the plan going forward for the next 3 weeks is going to be every Friday at 12:30 p.m. Pacific. Uh as many of the four of us as can be there uh will be here covering this. The show does come out on Tuesday nights, but because there's three episodes, we want to give us as much time as possible to watch them, give y'all time to watch them, and to have us talk about that. And hey, if uh you want to wait, you can always watch this stuff later. Catch up at the show whenever you want to and then check out our full spoiler thoughts here. This will not just",

We got to we got to get into the nitty-gritty of it. Yeah. So, again, um I'm thinking that next Friday it will be all four of us together unless something goes horribly arry. Um but I'm very excited for that. But hey, that's the future. We're here now. This is our weekly andor breakdown. Thank you so much for joining us. Returning to Star Wars, you can watch it live on YouTube and Twitch. You can get it later on podcast services around the globe.

I want to get right into some Star Wars talk real quick. Been a while since we've talked about anything Star Wars. Yeah. Um, any top level thoughts on Star Wars post Ahsoka season 2? Sage, did you watch Skeleton Crew? Did you watch uh any of the the animated stuff they put out there? So, I watched Skeleton Crew. I'm not caught up on the animated stuff right now. I loved Skeleton Crew and I didn't feel like a lot of people were talking about it. Um, it was exactly what I thought it was going to be. It was The Goonies. It was childlike joy.

Oh, yeah. Yeah. One I think the coolest kid in all of Star Wars. 100%. Uh, jumping off that, it's honestly, you took the words right out of my mouth. If I was a kid watching that show, like it would have changed everything. Not that Star Wars already didn't change everything, but like it really was. Skeleton Crew rocked. Like I feel like it was so different for Star Wars and we've seen many things try to be different, but I don't think necessarily succeed. I think Andor is the exception to that.

And there was more than a fair share of like big things that happened that I was like, whoa, I didn't like the big mystery of the planet was very satisfying to me. And and I think that show was great because it leaned into being different. I think sometimes some other Star Wars stuff when they try to be different. It's always like one foot in, one foot out. And this really leaned into being a Goonies pirate inspired adventure. Um it just happened to be in the Star Wars universe.

Uh yeah, really fantastic show. Yeah, really liked that. Um and then there was the acolyte which I still have not seen because it happened during my wedding uh time. So, I I was like way too busy. And one day I will go back and watch it because it is the only live action one I haven't seen. Um Barrett, you want to start off on your quick thoughts on that? I liked it. I I liked it more by the end of it cuz I think where that season ends, the things that they were setting up, I was like, \"Okay, I'm excited where we're at now and where this is going.\" throughout the show.

Um I I liked the, you know, kind of teen ya angst of it all. Um, it felt very, it felt like a show that would have come out during uh, you know, Lucas still running things and like we're still in the middle of like doing the prequel trilogy in some positive and some negative ways. Uh, but I I overall had a good time. Very very uh, bummed out that it got cancelled or Yeah. is not continuing. What What did you think, Sage? I I loved the acolyte.

Um I think it was a fun story and I do feel like the most disappointed cuz it felt like there was more story to tell there. Like it definitely feels unfinished to me um in that it was supposed to have another season. So I'm I'm bummed to see that. Obviously, we know where a lot of the like divisiveness and hate came from for the acolyte. Um, but yeah, I I think it's really wild when there's so much bad content out there that people were like the acolyte is bad. I do think it was sold not in the right way because it feels very much like the the trailers was like murder mystery kind of like almost cop detective procedural and the show is not that.

Well, jumping off that, uh the the marketing and the prehype cycle for this little show called Andor was very interesting. Uh because when the show was announced, everyone's first reaction at a time when they were announcing the Mandalorian and all these like bigger Kenobi. It's like we're really getting a show about Cassie and Andor from Rogue One. Like why would we ever do that? And then we saw the trailers and we're like this looks pretty good, but we'll see.

Uh, and we were all together on that journey going through all the different arcs. I, uh, recently rewatched the entire season 1 cuz Gia had never seen it. She's given up on Star Wars as a whole in terms of the all the Mando shows and stuff. She made it through season 2. She's like, I don't think this is for me anymore. And I'm like, that is totally fair. Uh, but for Andor, I was like, one day when season 2 comes out, this is going to be for you. And she fell in love with it. I refell in love with it where I'm like, you know what? Andor season 1 as good, if not better, than I thought it was. So very top level.

Um, I think it's really interesting how much they've been splitting their time in kind of like the jumping between these really three places and then kind of mostly jumping between Cassian and Monothma. Um, I would say the strongest right now that I has me the most invested is probably Monothma's story, but I also love like deeply love her as a character and love like the historical place in the rebellion that she holds. Um, I did not expect the storyline between Sirill and Dedra at all. Oh, I'm just Oh, they walk in the apartment. I was like, wait, wait, what? They got mom drama. This is awesome.

You know, totally. Sometimes people just need to have sometimes people need to have a good sit on their bed trying to disassociate from throwing a little tantrum, dude. God, I love And dude, the one of my favorite I had to pause and rewatch it cuz it made me laugh so hard. Legitimately, I think the funniest moment in Star Wars history is him talking to the like the the guy on his first day or whatever and like giving a recap of from his perspective his journey in season 1.

Yeah. Um you know uh things that won't get us demonetized or whatever.

Uh and I think that's a really really interesting like view into the empire. Yeah absolutely Barrett. Uh yeah, I I really adored these first three episodes. Uh no surprise, we're we're were so [\u00a0__\u00a0] back. Uh I think the way the season starts feels like such a response to a lot of people who started the first three episodes of the first season felt like it moved too slow and they were like, \"Ah, we need action.\" And it was funny like",

Uh but besides that, yeah, like the I I do wonder if like the structure of this season, every three episodes, every week, uh tackling a new year. And I do wonder like if it's going to be jarring skipping from what we just got in these first three episodes to next week. But I do wonder if there's going to be different kind of overall themes for each year. Uh because the one that really uh kind of stuck to me for these first three episodes was, \"All right, now after, you know, you're forced to wake up and look at uh kind of um fascism in the face, where is everybody going to be at after that first step?\"",

And I think every single kind of uh plane of action that we have over these uh first three episodes uh between Andor's mission gone wrong uh kind of catching up with uh Dedra and uh intern Sirill uh catching up with uh Mon Mothma and her daughter getting married and uh there was a fourth one as well that I'm blanking on. Um, oh, and then Bix and Braso and Will and the end uh kind of scene, right, where we get the cut between man getting [\u00a0__\u00a0] wasted at her daughter's wedding with the uh remix uh uh Space Miami music uh playing at the wedding and then cutting to Andor Bixs and Will flying off um really pulled that all together uh for me.

Not that there was any full grasp on the control at all throughout the first three episodes, but uh the little that they had.

Um, but second place was the Andor stuff. And I think it's because while Andor didn't do much new, I think that uh there is something about the familiar that like strengthened it for me of him being in these situations constantly. I think now after what we saw from season 1 of him kind of just not wanting to get involved then getting thrust into it then having to be the guy save himself so many times.

And I wonder how quickly that happens. Maybe I'm super off about this and like chances are I probably am cuz it it ends with him just flying off. But I get the vibe that he might go save them later.

Just what if some of those characters are just there there possibly? That's what I was thinking. I I for me it felt so em uh kind of uh it was a parallel to how we're introduced to Andor in Rogue One where this dude who kind of helps him get this information and he sees how like oh this dude is lost and this dude is gone and he's going to be kind of dead weight and he [\u00a0__\u00a0] kills him.

But on top of that, the one thing that he didn't demand, but in hindsight probably should have, even though it's shady and not cool, is having uh Man's daughter marry his son.

I want to shout out the moment with Clea and Vel where you know they finally they meet uh at the wedding before Clea goes back to Coruscant and uh Vel's trying to be like did did we just meet or whatever and she's like no you've obviously been to the store so like we've it makes sense for us to talk at this wedding. Yeah. Like keep up with this you know we're just we're just catching up and we're you know looking for uh potential hookups at this wedding. She says something much more sophisticated. And Vel kind of looks her up and down and walks away. And Clay's reaction to just being thrown off by that is so uh Yeah, it's gold. Uh Billy Sunrider in the chat says that the the dude that was born on Naboo is Erskin, who's Mma's aid in rebels. Oh, and honestly that makes sense cuz I thought it because he was born on Naboo, but he's part Gorman and it's like or",

Um, but yeah, that's awesome that that's a little detail picked up. And it makes sense cuz he talked about how like man brought him in and then he's like quickly cut off by Tay. One uh thing I forgot to bring up during the the Bix conversation uh is the the dude character. I forget his name. Will. Will his little love with the girl and having to say goodbye to her. Oh yeah.

Uh, I do think it's hilarious how it's introduced though where uh it's in the first episode and it's like our first time kind of catching up with Bix after her nightmare. Uh, and they're working on something and she go and this is the most like non-S Star Wars thing that I've ever heard where she looks over at Will when this girl is approaching and she's like, \"You thirsty?\" And then it cuts over to the girl and he's like, \"What? Shut the [\u00a0__\u00a0] up.\" And then he's his response is, \"Can you just be normal?\" And it's like, \"What is",

Um the most that they shared is that she was tortured by the same guy who tortured his dad right before his dad was killed. Um and what a haunting way to introduce that side of the story in these first three episodes. in the first episode where it's kind of like POV walking into their uh little um house or home or whatever. Will's kind of in a sleeping outside and you walk in and when it goes to the mirror it is the scientist who uses the you know the death of these uh babies that were",

Exactly. God. And I was like I was scared. The last thought I had is the I was scared when she is in that fight with the uh Imperial officer. Um there's a moment where she hits her head and she's kind of like out of it. I was like, [\u00a0__\u00a0] man. What is this? Like is this going to regress her in? Because it's where she ends in season one where we find her here. There's been a lot of like I don't know if healing is the right word, but there's been a lot of like kind of finding herself again.

But can you imagine like she regresses? So she was where we understand her to be at when Cassian left and then if Cassian had come back and from hitting her head she had regressed back to the place of like just post torture would have been devastating. Um I'm glad that they found each other again but yeah I mean even then though she's so messed up. I obviously uh Braso just died but like the final shots of her and the TIE fighter like she looks messed up man. Like she woof we'll see. We'll one year later solve it.
