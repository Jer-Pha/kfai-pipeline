How about we take it to the next level?\" So, I thought, \"Let's go grab the giant bomb team and let's go have a competition.\" They say, \"Haven't heard enough.\" Kind of funny. Versus Giant Bomb in the ultimate sponsored stream for Monaco 2. You hear his voice, my main man Jeff Grub. Jeff, how are you and the crew over there?
