Well, let's do this. So that's incredible. I love that. And then we kind of documented it, you know. Yeah.

And then of course we uh had Matt and Rich start start us through the journey of getting here starting in 2007, starting the whole thing. Then Skyrim coming in and changing everything, which is kind of where we left off. And I feel robbed because we ended that episode and we walked off and Matt immediately goes, \"Oh, we didn't even bring up the fact that Skyrim changed the name of the game.\" That's right. I I didn't know this either. talking to you about this. What were you calling it before Skyrim? And yeah, and and that's not just a saying. We literally had to change the name of the game.

But after Skyrim literally launched and literally became one of the best games of all time, we were really concerned that um by calling it Origins, by calling ESO, Elder Scrolls Origins. Yeah. Um, people would think it was a prequel to Skyrim cuz it's the next Elder Scrolls game that comes out. It would come out 2 years, 2 and a half years after, right? So, uh, just to make sure no one was confused and knew it was the multiplayer Elder Scrolls game, we changed it to Elder Scrolls Online. So, still ESO, we didn't have to change the executable name, which was good. Uh, the engineers, they were very happy, loved us, loved us for that. Had to go through all the code and change what ESO",

What can we put in here that makes it make sense? I love that you got there in the end. And I think that's, you know, jumping off of the end of episode one where we were, the one thing we talked about was Skyrim changing everything. Okay, you need to do that. As the juggernaut that was and is Skyrim continues to tumble down that hill, what does that do for you leading up to this launch in 2014? Is it just immense pressure? Is it this idea, oh man, we're not going to live up to expectations of what people want from that? Well, we were working so hard.

Uh this is 2012, right? when uh um uh Obamacare thing just got announced and remember I don't know if you remember back so far ago but the government website uh collapsed under the weight of all the people and we had like eight times the traffic of that of that website and uh and so we got like 5 million beta signups in like two days or it was it was ridiculous which which of course added to the pressure but is that excitement though or is that an no that's like okay there's a market people want to play this and then it's a oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] now we got there's going to be expectations that we're going",

I've always wondered this for you as video game developers, right? Video game developers at large. Obviously, I've heard so many times that when you're in it, you can no longer see the forest for the trees, right? you're so lost in it, you don't know if everybody I've ever talked to as a developer is always like, I we don't know what we're launching. Is it good? Is bad. It's up to the players. In that runup to launch and you're seeing you're not hitting the things you necessarily wanted to, not as many zones, not as many this.

That moment for me was when the reviews came out, which were before launch but not long I forget it was but sometime in that it's a little hazy we were working a lot um but there was again like some people loved it some people hated it so it was hard to draw a conclusion from from the reviews I think we had previews we had a preview day that's what it was and everyone was like the idea is great the game looks really good you know not sure if it's going to add whatever pet peeve that that uh that they had and and whatever that one specific person wanted from their but the thing is we knew on some level we weren't quite there but we also knew we had to launch it was time right it it was we just had to get the game out there so stop there again please explain that to me as a layman like how do you know when it's just",

It's something that to this day, you know, when when I'm reviewing stuff that the team is building, um I'm not in the everyday day-to-day stuff.

It just wasn't as a success, right? It was kind of that gray area in in between. And and obviously by business standards, not being a success means means you're a failure. But it really wasn't because the game worked. Like uh we'll go into a couple I think we're going to go into a couple of specific things that were that were uh terribly wrong. But uh here's where it didn't work. Yeah. But the servers mostly were up.

Um PC was obviously a lot smaller, but it was it was more So yeah, we did Oh, we did a pre-launch. So, we did if you had pre-ordered the game, you got in a week early. Y and that was rough cuz uh that was a lot of players pre-ordered. That was Ed like literally our CTO literally just mcking with the cues and that was console launch. That was Oh, that was console launch, right? Yeah. Yeah. No, this was insane. Yeah. Th this was uh we had sales forecast. We knew how many people how many people bought the game.

You could, but it was just slower. Um but more people pre-ordered it than we thought. And so, our pre-launch, you know, our early access period was launch and uh and and and we had a couple of of of bad problems that made us extend that pre-launch period by by a couple of days because we had to take servers down and uh and fix things like gold. Uh, you'll hear this a lot if you talk to online game developers, but Gold Dup where players can figure out how to how to duplicate money infinitely. Was that you duping? Were you dubing? It was you, wasn't it? I wasn't duping. Yeah, there were problems on that level. Like people would log in and their inventory would be gone. And and so these are things every online game runs into.

And so I would classify this as like we knew we were going to run into problems like this, right? And you always know the first two weeks is going to be not a lot of sleep and a lot of stress and you'll figure it out. Um, our tech team, which we never talk enough about, were were at at that time in 2014 were people I had worked with at Mythic and beyond for years and years and years. So we were pretty battleh hardened and we knew what needed to be done. Um, so none of that scared us.

We had hit all of the good things with combat and small button bar and those were Elder Scrolls, but the questing didn't and uh for very funny reasons. I mean, what sounds good on paper doesn't always work good in in practice, work well in in practice. And so what? Well, so you know, in a lot of single player games and, you know, in in Oblivion and whatnot, there were worldchanging moments, right? You go into an area, it's under attack, you clean it up, you deal with the problem, and then everything goes back to pristine, and everybody's happy, right?

So I go into the area, I'm a brand new player. You are in that area, but you've already completed it. We can't see each other. We can't play with each other. Sure. So we had all these player separation issues. Even if you're in the same group. Yeah. Even if you're in the same group. So you would see like the little arrow above, you know, and just floating in the air to designate that your group member was there, but you couldn't actually play with it. Got it. Cuz the way the tech works is that area is actually all in the same area. It's just uh it's called layering and you can layer in different content that some people can see and some people can't.",

Meun Deon comes and storms through the Imperial City and crushes it flat at the end of Oblivion, right? It's like those are awesome moments and we wanted to capture that feeling. And so we had almost every one of the major POIs in the game, almost everyone had two or three states and for the first two days it was great. Players like this is awesome and then they started to invite their friends and their friends needed to catch up and they would group and they lost their friends.

I mean again you're building looking back at it. It's a duh moment. It's like well duh. Of course, right? But you know we just finished talking about how you're in it. You're you're excited about it. You're you're really interested in in this thing and it worked and it was really cool. It's just we didn't think about that extra part.

Uh and uh so it worked there. You still getting residuals on this is why so much. We made it. All right, mythic. We get it. Well, the but the important thing is the PVP system in ESO is essentially a copy of Camelot system. And so that uh you only saw enemy alliances when you were in the disputed territory and then you could they look like NPCs. You couldn't talk to them. Like they were literally look like NPCs.

There's no nothing. And the game didn't do a good job of explaining separation like that. So player separation was on the quest level, on the on the world level. Um, and that was a big problem to unspool. Like it not complicated. It just took a lot of busy work by Rich and his team. Yeah.

You've done the blog post, the apology things that you now have this, I assume, dedicated fan base, right, that is showing up and giving you true feedback. It's critical obviously, but they're there for you. So, this is again going to shock you, but there are are people out there in internet land that love to drag games they don't like. No, I know. Shocking. I know. Don't they know there's better things to do, right? I I would like to think so, but um so we had two kind of concurrent tracks of information. And one was basically everyone saying this game is awful and uh and we hate it and we hate the people that made it and and we're going to stream, you know, 24/7 that we hate this game, right?

And so it's hard to separate as humans sometimes those two streams because uh you know we got a lot of stuff directed at us in that in in that time and some of it was fair, a lot of it was not. And uh so um we're built to take this, but the team, you know, the newer members of the team that that are younger, it was it there were a lot of uh soul crushing. Yeah. Soul crushing conversations with people just like it's okay, you know, they don't hate you. Uh they just they just hate your work. They they just hate your work.

But uh then then we turned really to the hey let's look at what players are playing in the game. Um, we had kind of this three-sided matrix that we used of uh we knew we needed to make changes and this then turned on Rich to change. But so we looked at uh what players are doing in the game like literally the metrics like what are they doing and then what are they telling us they should do.

One of the first things that I I did is I had our uh business intelligence group pull a list of all of the active devs who were playing ESO, not just at ZOS, but everywhere. So like there were a ton that I had no clue at BGS that were lifers, like just literally did nothing but play ESO, which was really cool. Yeah. Um and I sent out a big email to them. I'm like, \"Give me your top five pain points.\" And then I put them all together and mapped them out against the player feedback. And there was a lot of overlap, like a lot of overlap there.

Like, I've said a few times and and heard this, you know, in in some feedback where at launch, we didn't really know the game we wanted to make, right? We tried to walk that line between MMO and Elder Scrolls game and we had this kind of weird path in between the two. So it wasn't like exactly what everybody wanted. And when we chose based on feedback and and our feedback, when we chose to make Elder Scrolls be the first bullet, so to speak, that helped frame a lot of conversations going forward and changed kind of the mentality. And it led to some really crazy discussions that Matt and I have had over the years. But like it was always make it more Elder Scrolls. And that was that conversation started with Skyrim for us.

What does that list look like? Because again, I I understand the competingness, right, of an MMO or an Elder Scrolls game. But like I guess what's an example of make it more Elder Scrolls and this is what we did. So you play Oblivion for the first time, you come out of the you come out of the dungeon, the tutorial, right? You could do go anywhere. You can go anywhere, right? Elder Scrolls, you have to go through zone A, zone B, zone C, and then if you're lucky, you'll do the quest if you're lucky, if it works, and then and then you go to that cuz that now he sounds like a player cuz when we launched that quest was broken, but uh then then you get to go to the other alliance",

Got it. Got it. Got it. Obvious that wasn't an Elder Scrolls experience, right? People wanted to log into the game, create a character, and just do whatever the hell they wanted. And we'd uh before launch, we had done the combat feel, small button bar. So, like Rich said, it it felt like an Elder Scrolls game, but it didn't play like an Elder Scrolls game. And so, the next series of things were content, right? Make sure the make sure that you can go anywhere, do anything. Um, make sure that there are things to do in zones that aren't quests. like we were very quest driven, but you know, for those that played, you know, any any any Elder Scrolls game, like exploration, you can go through the dungeons and figure out wacky things to do with",

Is this a conversation then again with BGS talking to Todd's team like to to get more of like what what the powers inside of a dungeon kind of idea? No, it was more it it was more us, right? Like I think one of the really cool things about, you know, Todd is he's like, \"You got to do what works for your game.\" Like he's he's the steward of the lore and the IP. And so whenever we're trying to do like really crazy things, yes, there's a conversation that we have about the lore and how it's going to impact things.

And I was like, Todd, is it okay IP-wise if we don't have underwater swimming? And he's like, have you ever had a meaningful experience underwater in an Elder Scrolls game? And I was like, no. And he's like, exactly. Nailed it. Done. Don't worry about it. So, but that's that was the that was what Rich is saying. It's like it was like what works for you, right? Don't don't worry so much.

But there weren't many viable other options except for Guild Wars I was was the one that we ended up kind of going going with that model, but that big game and and a great game. I've spent a lot of time in that game, but uh um that wasn't the star we were following. Like we were like we're we're following Skyrim, right?

I mean, I use a controller on PC. One of my favorite stories, you know, of of that that mouse and keyboard versus versus controller is, and this is quite a bit after launch. I think this was for Morowind. We brought a number of um people in to to play um the game and give us feedback on on the features and and what we were doing. And we had a really good mix of console gamers and PC gamers. And uh the PC gamers, there was a number of PvPers and they were all talking a lot of smack and right. So they had a dueling tournament.

And I was like, \"Okay, yeah, it's going to be okay.\" Gamers are gamers. It's awesome. So, we were saved on the console um whole the the whole console thing. We were saved by the fact that we were developing the console version right when Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were not yet launched but both Microsoft Xbox and and Sony were were looking for content. And so also both of them shared a similar architecture and both of them had similar architecture to Windows.

Um, uh, Chelsea was the head of of Iron Galaxy Now was our was the lead producer on on ESO console and, uh, so which we call Project Bluebird. And, uh, so we we were able to give that to them and then go fix our stuff before console launch. And so that was very much the plan was we know we need to launch console again like PC. We know we need to launch at some point relatively soon because we got to make some money. Um, but we're going to give you enough runway to fix the things.

And uh so that was the big change that then we we started working on and we had almost a exactly a year to do all of those changes. Um no big deal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. rebuild the well, not rebuild the game, but change a lot of the game, right? Yeah. Rich and I did a retro kind of this in uh at one of the Quakecon in 2018 or 2019 where we talked about this this thing and I went back and watched that and I had forgotten so much stuff that we did, which is funny because when we were on stage there talking about it, we had already forgotten about a lot of stuff that had happened in the years before.

So, you could if you bought the game at any time, you could play it as much as you wanted, but if you wanted customization and convenience items, you could you could now had virtual currency. Sure. And there was an optional subscription. So, that went in update 6 like a bunch of combat changes. Ballpark. How far out from launch is update 6? Uh it is I can tell you exactly. It is March 16th, 2015. The day before St. Patrick's Day. There you go. So, never forget uh the green mirror was flowing next day.

So, it console didn't launch till June, but this was the build that was going to be the console launch build. And so, uh and the fact that we made it so you could just if if you had bought the game at any time since launch, you could you no subscription anymore. So you could just log in and play. And so we ran a a marketing campaign of like just come back and check it out. What do you got to lose? What do you got to lose? It wasn't quite that level, but it was but it was a drag off. What else you going to do before? So yeah. So our um there were a bunch of other changes in there. Quality of life changes, a bunch of guild stuff.

And then and then the whole narrative around the game changed. But completely changed and everything. Our stream our our stream reviews, which were uh don't ever read these reviews uh territory suddenly started to go up and up and up. Right before console launch they actually reached reach reached positive mostly positive and then console launch and then that just it then the trajectory was was stratospheric. So that was the move to go to more of a freetoplay model there with if you bought the game once you could play as much as you want without any subscription.

You said you had about a year to make all these changes and one of them being the business model. I have always found these discussions fascinating and I've never had this level of access to one. So you launch, oh man, they hate the subscription. Where does that conversation start? Is that going to uh the late great Robert Alman and being like, hey, we got to do this.

Rich was hands deep in fixing uh all kinds of problems in the game. And this was me going to the boardroom and and saying we [\u00a0__\u00a0] up. We got to change the business model, showing uh based on data that that we got from industry, you know, publications at the time around how virtual currency would work and what it would take to get us there. um just the fact that getting lapsed players into the game introduced the concept of laps players because that concept didn't exist before in in ESO or Bethesda. Yeah. And uh so it was funny their reference for buying things virtual currency, which the generic term obviously is DLC, but to them that was oblivion horse armor. Horse armor.

You can't buy your way to success. You can buy your way to look better, you know, if you want. Um and we're going to have an optional subscription that gives you some virtual currency per month and gives you some some in-game perks as well. And we did some modeling which was good.

Like what you had one second chance. Yeah. Exactly. And and I'll I'll blatantly name drop here, but uh the uh the Zenamax board of directors back then, I don't know if you've ever ever gone into that, was like Jerry Brookheimimer and uh you know, guy guys Cal Ripken, like like really really uh famous notable people. And after PC launch, I had to go to go to the board and uh and present the findings. And Jerry Brookheimimer actually said, unlike movies, which launch worldwide, you get a chance to for a doover, right? because you're going to go to console and don't don't uh ever think this isn't a giant opportunity cuz now people know what it is and you just have to convince them that it's",

You can't you can't change them. And the whole concept to him was amazing that you could have something on one platform and kind of massage it and make it better and then go to a bigger platform and and redo it. And so um which was a great way to look at it and that's and and that's the way that we ended up doing it. So you're looking at that model now and saying, \"Okay, this is the findings. This is what we want to do.\" You're going to keep still the price tag of to get in, you have to pay X, but then you don't have to pay monthly. Is it now, hey, I got to get a creative team.

But yes, we uh so uh we had a designer on on on staff named named Lee Lee Ride out who is actually still in in this position now who came from a game he was a g designer on the team, not a monetization designer. And we had him design the monetization system. And he approached it from a game perspective, not necessarily a financial perspective. And he's like, \"What do players want to buy based on this game that I just spent eight years making?\" Right? Uh what would I do? I want to look cooler. I want to have I can craft potions, but I can just buy them and maybe that's easier for me cuz I don't want to get into the crafting system, right? And it came in up up with all of these things.

And it also helped that the the ethos, right, was do no harm. Yeah, that was that was literally wrote that on the white boards. Number one, do no harm, right? Wish more people did that. It's it's literally just convenience is cosmetics. And we've kind of run up against that line over over time, but that's always been the core is do no harm. And that helped solve a lot of conversations, right? And helped really fine-tune and focus Lee and team on what are the types of things. And now we have this huge pipeline for in-game cosmetics and all that other stuff. Yeah. So yeah, we have a lot of artists working a lot making costumes and and die colors and I mean",

So you can get all these things almost all of them without needing to go into the currency store, but if you want to save some time, you can you can grind for it in game. You can buy them. And uh so it hit just right with the with the player base. Obviously, there was some concern for the player base in in the early days, but but it was uh it it was the right thing to do at just the right time.

What were some that were left on the floor that was not the perfect model of like hey that's not the right way or we don't want to do that but it's close. I I mean it it all goes back to that that mantra right of do no harm. So there were sure there were lots of explorations of like can players just buy power straight up? Can they just buy boosted characters?

Everything goes perfectly. This is it. This is the mo. This is the We don't need the other two episodes of the show. This is it. This is the the big moment, right? Yeah.

And uh we literally sat in that room and watched the charts, you know, you could see how how users logging in, CPU going up uh till it got to the red and and finally after eight days, Ed figured out how to how to fix it and fix it. And then we got up to 125,000 concurrent. And then and then that was fine. That's where the 500,000 number comes from cuz with our login queue and all the servers added together.

It was a good problem to have, but it was still pretty a problem. A problem. When the dust settles and the things are back to green and everybody can get in and play the game, then what are we seeing? How does what I mean? You guys have created a game and I know you're no one knows this better than you. So I'm I'm talking more to the audience. You've created a game that is never done. That is you're never you're never shipped. You're never you're never gold. You're never done. There's always another thing. So I assume this is great. Numbers are great.

It goes back to the gamers are just gamers and and they can do anything. It was it was the same kinds of things. And we had done a ton of stuff like we did six updates in a year, which is ridiculous, right? We do four in a year now. So, we did six updates in a year, a ton of new stuff added in there. People were really happy, but there were some lingering things, right? The the whole it's still hard to play with my friends, right? It's it's it's that kind of stuff.

Our content teams were actually still making new content. We just weren't putting it in the game. So, after console launch, we actually had some content in the can. And uh so we launched Imperial City, which was a PvP centric PVE zone, which is awesome. If you never played Imperial City, all any of you out there in uh ESO land, go play Imperial City. It's a lot of fun. Uh and the next which important for this conversation was Orcsinium. And Orsenium was our first real DLC. Still, I think is the best content that we've done because we had a team working on it for like two years because they had time to go in and do all of the little things. It feels amazing.

We have millions of players. Orinium we want to Imperial City was easy. It was PvP, right? Our PvP system is is uh level scaled. So you go into the PvP zone and it doesn't really matter what level you are. It's just a matter of your skill and your and your build and and and your gear because we wanted as many people to play PvP as. So, Hero City, no problem. Orinium comes up and then we have the discussion, what level is Orsenium? Because this is a level based game. Um, if you're level 10, you can't really have group with a level 15 person, right? That you just won't get any. It's just doesn't work. Sure. Old school old school",

Old school old school still in that in that sense. And again, a product of the time, especially for you guys with this MMO background, like that that's how things were, especially in 2007, let alone where we were in 2015. like for you know people who need to be educated remember it was such a big deal when I forget Borderlands 2 was like hey you come together and it doesn't matter you're all able to play it was like what how is that possible what are you doing how's that yeah yeah I mean we had Oblivion and Skyrim is yeah single player games but North Stars there like didn't matter what level you were yeah you know it's just the world scaled to you but Orinium was like what level is it the best content in the game do we want to save it for max level players like we want people to get in there and it's like",

And so, uh, after many whiteboard sessions, yeah, that was the test bed for it's levelless. Yeah. And we had to figure out what the heck that meant and battle leveling and solve all the grouping issues and all that other stuff. But it was uh it turned out to be the right thing to do. players absolutely loved it and and we saw like things we didn't even think about happen. Like guild recruitment went through the roof because there was a place where everybody could all be and they could play with their guildies. Didn't matter what level it was, right? Didn't matter what alliance was, they could just play with each other. And we were like, hm, that's interesting. And then",

And we were like, hm, that's interesting. And then that led to a few days at Matt's house over the Christmas break talking about one Tamriel. Yeah. Yeah. Well, back to our Cinium real quick. Uh, if you all missed it when Rich went over, we called it levelless or battle leveling, but what it basically meant is you could just go into the zone and it the zone scaled to you or you actually you scaled to the zone. And so, we didn't even tell the players what level was. We didn't mention it at all. We didn't even And they just went and played and nobody even knew it was in there except for the the guys that are that are crunching the numbers and they're like, \"Wait a minute, something's happening here.\" Uh, yeah. because this is such a it's an interesting twist on the similar problem we talked about earlier, right, of like, well, okay, I come to",

I'm like, yeah, I can't do anything. Yeah. And and you know, the the term I used when I was in meetings with Rich and uh and and the team, it was like, uh, does anyone really care what level they are in GTA? Right. You just jump in and play. Why can't we just jump in and play? And Orcenium showed that we could do that. And players didn't even know we were doing it. It was it was it was done in in in in such a good way.

So, this leads to you going to his house over Christmas break. Yeah. It was it was was that in 2015 Christmas 20 it was 2015 and right after Orinium launched right after Orinium launched and Matt was like hey we we need to chat and I'm like uh oh so we spent spent two days at at his house over the Christmas break talking about doing the orinium treatment to the entire game. I was like what? Like really? And so we had to go through a whole host of things. Everything from you know do we gate it again do we not to like what's progression look like now? Yeah, cuz that's a huge part of an online game is progression and and and all that stuff. And",

And then what's a heated moment look like on this first change of the levels. I know. It was it was a bigger discussion initially, which is we have this hit game. We have a lot of people playing it. We just launched this amazing DLC. We're finally in a great place. We're finally in a great place. What do we do now? Yep. And you're like blow it all up pretty much. Well, or or you can also see uh which is which is where we started with this of like the path that started before launch of us making the game more Elder Scrolls like making the game levelist like like I said like Oblivion and Skyrim is kind of the holy grail.

Um, and so we wanted that idea in there proved that we could do it. And the yelling was more about it sounds easy to make the game levelist, but what it really did is, uh, if you were in the launch version of the game, you created a character, you went to Blee, uh, let's just, uh, do Daggerfall. You went to Stro Makai, then you went to Betnick, then you went to Glenn Umbra, then, you went to Storm Haven, then you went to Rivenspire. Um, right. Every player did that. So that means we developed the content, not the quest, but the content, the monster level, the the way the game interacts with you. We made that with the assumption that you would have five or six zones to get to level 50. So Glen Umbra had a lot",

So it wasn't just making it level. It meant Rich's team, and this is where he was trying to explain to me what what a giant pain in the ass this was going to be, was going in and make every zone 0 to 50. Yeah. Or zero to max level, right? Every zone had to have uh world bosses had to have easy monsters, middle monsters, com, you know, group group. And so every zone became a microcosm of the game, and that was where the complexity came from. Gotcha. Yep. And then itemization, like how do we handle that, right? like we had to implement an entire system around making sure players understood that they were still gaining power as they were leveling up.",

I don't know if you noticed the stars, you went through through five stars. So, that tells you how powerful your character is until you're 50 and then that basically goes away and it's based on your gear and your level and now your champion points. But um yeah, it was it was really it was it was fun. Like it was it was a fun conversation. It all had to happen behind the scenes though. I was going to say what happens when you come down from the mountain top and you tell all these developers, \"Hey, by the way, it was about the same reaction.\" Um and and that was that was interesting, right?

Oh wow. Um, and it wasn't they really thought like they thought it was going to kill the game. It was Yeah, it was the this is gonna be the death of ESO if we do this right. And when we eventually had our first play test with it, a lot of those people when they played it, they were like, I understand now. Like, this makes sense now. This is awesome. We were wrong. This is great. Right? And I'll never forget Dan Batson sent me a long email. He's like, I know I was a vocal critic of this. You guys were totally right. like this was the absolute 100% on board now.

I actually had to stop at at one point and uh and Are you okay, ma'am? Are you okay? Yeah. Incredible. Yeah. Yeah. But so that that was a moment and when we launched it was antilimactic because to the players they just launched in logged in and it was and to you guys you're like first off this humongous undertaking.

We launched Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, which are story DLCs, which were awesome. And then we ended with one Tamriel. And then it was what do we do next? What do we do what do we do next? And yeah, and uh actually this is Todd Vaughn's idea. Todd Vaughn's the you know VP of product development at Bethesda. Um, he was like, \"Now that you have all this great stuff, you should actually cash in on the nostalgia, the the actual big moments of other Elder Scrolls games and and make a package of new stuff. Don't just don't just dribble it out over time, which which was Steve's Guild and Dark",
