It doesn't make sense, but also like they made something special out of they made something really special and it wasn't until many years later that that kind of like resonated and it's become such a a big like kind of hit but like a cult classic really within the Disney uh ethos.

I could bring up tears right now just thinking of various moments in the season, but I did find myself missing the rich lyricism of that previous chapter, the sprawling humanity of it, the devastating finality of it. Maybe all that too is being saved for season 3. John Nent at Empire gave it five stars, saying, \"Moving and devastating in equal doses, The Last of Us remains poke post-apocalyptic television at its peak, and almost every turn it delivers. Pray to the video game adaptation gods that season 3 sticks the landing.\" What are your immediate thoughts on these reviews?
