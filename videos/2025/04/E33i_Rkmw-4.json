Highly recommend. Did you get to see it in 70 mm or just a normal? You did. Oh, I'm so jealous. It's sold out, man. I got to get No, it was packed. It was packed. That's great. You liked it, though? Loved it. Loved it. Yes, highly recommend. I've been seeing that our our friends Belinda and Yousef have seen it three times in three different formats. Good for them.

The episode starts with the game's rough launch and review scores before finding the ESO audience and building the playground they wanted. Come for the deepest dive of Greg Miller's career Friday on all your games cast feeds and on Bethesda's YouTube channel.

There's something different about this one, though, where as you're going through the level, like in the background, boss characters will be kind of popping out. Like there was uh one part in my preview where uh you're on a zipline and this like uh demon jumps at you to attack and then a giant like snake dragon thing comes and like kills him and it's just the coolest thing. and then a couple screens later you're fighting that giant snake thing and it just felt very very very cinematic and uh in a way that when that we saw the debut trailer for this it was like that handdrawn animation or maybe not handdrawn but like the more cartoony animation so far in the game there's",

Um, recently, I guess not recently, cuz we're getting incredibly old. The Messenger came out and, uh, The Messenger was a Yeah, that was my first year. Kind of funny, too. Yeah, recently. Okay. Doesn't seem like it was like It's It feels like it was Yeah. 2018. Feels like it was just here. Uh, man, that's crazy. But, uh, I love The Messenger. It was your first year. I think it was 17. Yeah.

And like I mean just look at some of the vistas in the back, right? like this is Ninja Guiden through and through in a way that I didn't expect how it would merge the old school NES games with the modern again very old man here. Uh the 3D Xbox Ninja Giden games and what a year for Ninja Gaiden fans. We have Black 2 coming out. We have we have four coming out later. We have this coming out. Like it's a great time.

I don't remember if it actually got a date, but either way, very very excited about it. One thing that I want to throw out cuz it really really blew my mind is uh Barrett, can you bring up the the intro to the original Ninja Gaiden? Uh the NES Ninja Gaiden was one of the first games, Nintendo games with like cinematics quote unquote. So it was like definitely a big deal. It's like what people like one of the things they remember besides the the brutal difficulty and all of that stuff. But super freaking sick. Like this is such an iconic video game thing here.

And that's you say two frames. It's like some of the animations are way more than that. No, I mean two frames of the whole animation.

Yeah, I really enjoyed this and I loved the kind of I I don't know what the first one was like, but the sense of momentum in terms of story stakes and what that was building uh up to, I thought was really cool.

That's Hades 2 for me. I think Hades 2 gets the full 1.0 0 release this year. Yeah. And it cannot be denied that that will likely be my my number one. I'm right there with you.

It's just with indie games and especially a indie developer that has proven themselves and have an audience as big as Super Giants is. I just don't think you rush it. So, it's just one of those like I'm always ready for everybody to delay their games and stuff, but you guys watch and pay more attention like I'm saying closely more closer to this one's uh early access journey.

I haven't learned in a game like this in so long where it's not explicitly explicitly telling me things. Interesting.

In addition to even all of the writing in the small stuff that does may not mean a damn thing. Although I think that everything in this game means something.

And I think something that shouldn't be understated is that like yes, getting to this room 46 in a 45 room house is your ultimate goal, but you are going to naturally find a lot of other mysteries and puzzles that even if there's a run where you get so close and you're like, gosh darn it, but hey, I I did unlock these three different rooms that have something going on.

Finally beat Kronos a couple months ago and it felt so good. Oh man, Hades 2. Madrock says, \"Unless I get caught up in the RPG vortex with Expedition 33, Hades 2 is going to be my game of the year for the second year in a row. Super Giant continues, so to [\u00a0__\u00a0] kill it.\" Uh, BJ Bernardo says, \"First of all, shout out to my goate blueprints, but also thank you for convincing me to try Citizen Sleeper 2 and South of Midnight.\" Hell yeah, man. That's what the show's all about. You know what I mean? Celebrating the video games, all of that. So enjoy, BJ. I also love how incredibly welldeveloped Hades 2 is and I I've the last 20 hours of me playing because I'm like 90 hours in.

Costa says, \"We often look at nominations uh nominees during strong years and say in any other year they'd win. How many of the top fiveish from last year could have won if released this year? So early. Yeah, that's the thing is like I think the answer is yeah, there's gonna be a whole new crop of games that could have won this year by the time we get to",

Yeah, I do think that uh I mean at least personally for me so far this year like we had a lot of bangers, but I feel like a lot of the bangers last year like are in the conversation as well. Prince of Lost Crown Rebirth. Yeah, totally. I mean for me I'd put those easily above South of Midnight. Shadow of the Earth. Would we be having that same Will we be having those same conversations though if GTA 6 comes out this year and post Mario uh Kart Worlds and all that stuff? Right. I'm still a doubter on GTA 6 coming out this year, but like I know Huber is very much it's coming this year, but you know, coming if I'm playing 30 frames per second on my console, that [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of my face, dude.

God damn. Uh I know I said it was the last one, but one just snuck in here. Riley said, \"Hey y'all. Uh, love the show. Greg, you're read that one. That one. You're going to waste Stars in the Bank. Uh, so besides Blueprints and Avowed, what other game of the year should I contender should I play on Game Pass for PC or Oblivion today, right? Yeah. I mean, that's a great call. I would say give South Midnight a chance. See if it's for you. It's on Game Pass. Um, and I mean, you know, Andy was bringing it up earlier, but Expedition 33, like with the demo, was awesome. And that's on Game Pass, which is awesome for them. So, later this week, go back to get a time machine. go back to last month and play and beat Lies of P while it's on Game Pass as of last month, but it's already off of Game Pass.

Oh, it's so good, Andy. Getting stoked for this DLC, which we still don't have a [\u00a0__\u00a0] date for. Summer 2025 is still what they're saying. It's like, what? Keely will drop that date on us. Like, yo, here it is. Is there going to be a shadow drop? Yeah, that's where I had a shadow drop, but he'll be like, \"Yo, it's coming out. The trailer will hit and it'll it'll be there'll be a date there for sure. It's so bizarre that we still don't have one. But god damn, like man, making your own weapons.
