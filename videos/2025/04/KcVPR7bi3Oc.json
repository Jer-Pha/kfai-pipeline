I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside kind of funnies ARPG expert and the host of the Diablo podcast. It's Zanth. Well, hello, Greg. How are you doing? I'm good, Zan. It always does me well to see you broadcasting from this basement. What were you You're always ready for kidnapping. What are you doing down there? Uh, well, I live in the Midwest. We have a basement dwelling and I'm just kind of sitting on the outskirts of my bar in case I need an emergency drink at some point during say the word. I'll join you. We're in there. It's 11:30 here. I mean, oh, speaking of which, uh, you know, uh, you were you were in my neck of the woods recently. I was. Of course you say that you're being very liberal.

Yes, I did. What's the actual name of it? I don't remember off the top of my head. Uh, it's called Ecto-Cooler. Well, but they spell it funny, don't they? Whatever. But it's a beer that tastes exactly like Ecto-Cooler. Exactly like Ecto-Cooler. It was so good. It was delicious. Right. Um, when I had had it, I was like, Greg is going to love this. So, I'm glad uh to hear that. Now, um, a little bit of more housekeeping before we Wait, but who makes that beer? I forget who makes that beer. Uh, that is Eagle Park Brewery uh, in Wisconsin.

Uh so you'll have to get that uh somewhere else and maybe Path of Exile will be for you. Um, so this releases April 4th and GGG, uh, Grinding Gear Games is a smaller development company, you know, out of New Zealand. Um, that's first major release was Path of Exile 1 and then this was the the major step up uh, in back in December, you know, it finally coming to life and and getting a lot of good traction and turned so many heads, right? was one that you texted me.

Um, you know, what's comical is, as you will see during all the trailers, an isometric ARPG is an isometric ARPG, right? They all have a very similar look. Like you're you're pushing that character forward with a mouse or a controller. You're, you know, casting a spell, you're swinging a sword. That's always kind of the same.

Sure. That was what drew me in, right? When you when you called me in for December to play it, when I got in there immediately, what I kept saying, right, was the weight. This felt weightier. It felt like, okay, cool. I'm not moving as quickly. Two enemies are a threat versus, you know, being surrounded by a mob in Diablo and not caring about it. And then yeah, getting to these battles that I kept describing for lack of uh uh being a smarter man to the audience as I think it's what Andy and the crew love about Souls likes where it's I come in and I got to learn this boss's pattern",

Like you've learned those bosses and then the next time through, which I know you hate. you're not a big fan of having to replay the campaign, but every time you come back to it, it it's a little bit easier because you you know what that boss is going to throw at you. You get a little bit better with those skills. Uh so this releases April 4th and as you you know kind of alluded, I've spent a lot of time there.

Being able to throw lightning spears around uh done, that's that's all I'm going to do for a very long time. Um, it's not to say there haven't been challenges.

Uh yeah, of course, it has that weird challenge of like it's in early access, but they also are kind of treating it as if it's a live game where here's a major patch and we've been holding off on doing quick reactions. Whereas, I think they're starting to adjust to what early access should be for this game of, okay, we're getting a lot of feedback. Let's start fixing that before we go on like a a two or three month hiatus before the next big thing like we would in a traditional ARPG space. Um, so it it's talk to me a bit about that reaction.

I don't play for eight to 10 hours a day. And how do you balance for that? How do you balance for the people who are going to put in over the course of a week what your traditional player might be able to get through over the course of three months? And that always leads to burnout. I think that's the other part of the ARPG problem is there there's a lot of burnout with any game that you play for that amount of time. Um, I'm always kind of relatively balanced with it where I don't feel like I burn out that quickly, but there are times when things just don't hit.

Uh so yeah, there has been a lot of uh that kind of sentiment within the Path of Exile 2 community of just wanting something a little bit different and I think it still is early access. They they've adapted a lot from what they've been able to see. It'll be curious to see what happens in the next couple weeks. Um you know, are they going to keep moving the levers? So, they are they going to keep balancing it out or are they going to kind of, you know, make a few more changes and then start pushing towards what will be the next major update? There there's still uh what five more classes that need to to show up, a bunch of new ascendancies. There are three full acts that aren't present. So, there's a lot of things that are still missing.

I I I don't think there's a right way. I think all feedback is is good as long as you can back it up. The the other danger with these games, too, is like a meta. uh somebody out there way smarter than me figures out the best way to build a character or the best possible skill and then everybody kind of plays that and then what are you missing? You're missing like half of your player base trying and and messing up things to to give you good feedback.

So like that that also kind of affects that cycle in terms of how the the game will then be iterated on. Have they given any road map for Path of Exile of where they think they are with eventually getting to a full release or leaving early access or are we just going to be in early access for a long long long time? I as far as I know I think they're under the impression that they can get it out uh before so the the goal was a year. It launches in December of 2024, but it's April. That's eight months from now to still introduce three new acts and five new classes. I I don't see it. And honestly, I'd rather let them cook. You know, take a little bit more time.

And I would recommend it to everybody to at least get in and play. I mean, one, it's always nice to play with a new class. Uh there's a whole bunch of new support gems. Uh I have found that if you played on day one, the the leveling of a character was far more brutal. It was harder. It felt a little bit more of a slog. uh the changes that have happened in just like the the two weeks time have been significantly better where I play only hardcore so I do die uh and then I have to go back and redo it all over again.

Okay, get in there, Greg. Toss some spears around. It's awesome. I'm sure it is. It's just the thing that for Path of Exile 2, which I loved back in December, I enjoyed. And I'm just not the early access guy. I would rather they be like, \"Here it is. Boom. the game is complete to what it's the same thing with Hades, too. Loved Hades. I you know what I mean?

I think it is the, you know, as we're going through this conversation, it's the perfect middle ground. It is not as rigorous perhaps as Path of Exile, and it's not as streamlined as Diablo I. It's it's really right in the middle and I think honestly it's probably the perfect introductory ARPG where you can then kind of figure out which which direction you would want to go in. Um you know as we're seeing here we have the the newest trailer for Tombs of the Erased their next big update you know their seasons uh that they have. This is the one that just came out. Yep.

Uh, online is built into so many ARPGs. This is one that has offline compatibility. And you were talking about like uh wanting uh possibly for Steam Deck. This to me strikes me as one of those perfect Steam Deck games. Uh I don't have a Steam Deck. Uh but if I did, I'd be playing it like non-stop, especially with that offline functionality, right?

You don't have to worry about playing with other people. Um in tandem with that, it does have uh just a great way to distribute loot. Like you are you have a lot more in-depth crafting that you know if there are things that you want for your character, if you want your character to be stronger, you have a lot more control of that.

You can kind of jump in and no matter what choice you make along the way, you're going to be successful. Like I don't think there's a bad way like the I don't think you can choose a skill and items throughout this game that will not get you to the endgame of it. Uh it's it's pretty well built in that regard. And we should point out that u you know this is 11th hour games. It's an all remote independent studio that is putting this together.

And as you're kind of branching out, each one of those little nodes will change the skill itself to do something. Now, you're never going to get enough points to do all of them, and some of them will run counter to what you might do on one end, but it's just that little bit of control.

Uh which is, you know, okay, the it's the the crux of every ARPG like all of them. We we'll get them through the story, but then how do we keep them? How do we keep them to keep playing over and over again? um so we don't lose them to another ARPG or whatever it it might be or the other myriad of games that that are out there. So this is more of a rework around that introducing a new faction. Um and really just it really what it boils down to is more stuff to do at the end, right? More stuff to play with.

Now that you have actual competition with new content, what like tonight when you get the chance today when you slip away to your treadmill to play games like a psychopath, where will you go? Like what is speaking to you? Like I have to get back and do X, Y, and Z. Uh well, unfortunately, uh because Last Epoch does not have console support, the only way I can run on that treadmill has got to be on console.

It's enough time to play through a campaign and get your hooks into whatever the end game happens to be and and maybe work out whatever you know challenge you had kind of set for yourself and then jump on to the next one and the next one.

What is the general community right now? because it does seem like for me somebody reading the raw interviews or seeing these headlines that there's been a bit of a they're trying to course correct where you know we're talking about this being oh it's so easy and you just murder everything and do the thing and I've seen the comments from them of well we want to go back to trying to be a bit harder is that accurate yeah I",

Let's bring it back to being more difficult. But then somebody else discovers something that's more blast blast blast. And um it's it's really kind of tough to balance. Uh, in terms of like general sentiment, I think two years in, it's like appreciating Diablo II for what it is and maybe tempering expectations about what it will be.

The fact that people have really leaned in on, okay, well, let's always be online. Let's do updates. Let's do this. Let's do that. That's a good question.
