Very true. Remember how hard it was to just the the amount of time and how long it lasted to get a PS5 during the pandemic. Sure. And it was not just websites being busted or whatever. It was just a supply chain issue and just a lot of issues with manufacturing. I if those issues don't really crop up here, then yeah, we could see these numbers be absolutely nuts.

A lot of me getting into video games growing up was babysitters either giving me N64 cartridges they didn't want anymore or uh, you know, playing uh, on my dad's like PS1 or whatever.

Like legitimately you remember when we it's before school and you'd wake up to have your cereal and watch TV. It's whatever was on VR VR Troopers Beetleborgs Power Rangers. I'm watching this old ass Dennis the Menace cartoon. I don't like it but it's on. I got to watch something. God forbid I talk to somebody.

Uh, one of them came from Jacubra, I believe, over on Twitch who said peer pressure is how you get them into playing other stuff, which on one hand is true, but on the other hand, I think is completely false because I always go back to when Jack Po's son, 10-year-old, was here last summer, right?

Sydney is set to executive produce. Sources tell Variety it has yet to be decided which lead role Sweeney will be playing, Zoe or Mio. Uh released on March 6th, the game quickly became a hit with players and critics alike, receiving positive reviews and massive sales. According to Hazes Light, the game sold more than two million copies in the first week following its launch, and that number continues to rise at a rapid clip. Andy Cortez, thoughts?

Full Circle says this may not be a surprise to anyone who has been part of Skate's Play test, but it may still be a surprise to those who haven't been partaking. After all, the original games were offline. Then again, the Skate Revival will be a free-to-play title on its release, so perhaps some were already expecting an online connection as standard. In addition to chatting about the lack of an offline mode, the Skate team also addressed the play test microtransactions. As reported in March, microtransactions were added during the game's closed alpha test. Quote, \"We know that using real money during a play test is a little unusual, but we think it's the best way to properly assess",

Andrew Super Chat says, \"Andy, I finally played Hyperllight Drifter and loved it. I beat Death's Door last year. What should I play next?\" It's got to be Expedition 33 after everything we've said on this. I mean, that's a phenomenal game, but if you're looking for something in that vein that's sort of that isomemmetric type vibe, Tunic real good. I would even say a game that I gave up on this at the end of last year because of just other [\u00a0__\u00a0] kind of came through. Crypt Custodian was an awesome one that I'm I I'm so bummed out that I didn't give more time to and I'm so I feel angry at myself that I started it way too late in the year because I loved the vibes",

I really loved eyelets from a few years back which is a Metroid vania where the Metroid Vania map are broken up into pieces and the whole kind of loop of the game is you bring is slowly bringing the map together. So the Metroid Vania going back to uh certain places is you just connecting certain parts of the map finally together. It's such a smartly designed game. That's so fascinating because Crypt Custodian, the way it operates, it's a top- down obviously isometric Zeldaike is what I would call it. Yeah.

It is solely story, but you'll walk up to a little little shrine or totem or whatever, and you walk up to it, and it'll be like, \"Hey, you'll get the sick ass power right now, but you have to kill five people without getting hit.\" And so they implement those things in their campaign story game and that are kind of like Rogite inspired of like, all right, big risk, big reward right here, and it'll be a sick ass power, but if you die, you're dead and you never get this power. So, I I love how they kind of mix genres, but this game is so cool, man. Indeed. Uh, two super chats to close you out. Yeah, a lot of people super chat and wish me happy birthday. Thank you so much.

I will riot and start protests. Thank you.\" Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] Well, first off, we're sorry to hear about your friend, Bluehead protagonist. I'm sorry. So, I'm sorry to hear the second part as well because you have to retire because I'm gonna get your star if I can make that happen. That's what you said. Yeah, I did say that time. Hell yeah.
