It's your boy Snowike Mike getting ready to netrun with my best friends Andy Cortez and Nick Scarpino. Runners, are you ready to play marathon? Welcome in, boys. Well, of course, you have had a full day of content with games, two games casts, I should say. Two games cast, a very special games cast. And then Alien versus Predator in review. And guess what? Nick and Andy are now here ready to play marathon with me. We're jumping into the closed alpha test. Of course, this will be going on for about almost two weeks, so maybe you'll be getting in and maybe you can jump in to the fun with us. But boys, welcome to another extraction shooter brought to you by Bungie. So now we got a little touch, a little sci-fi action.

Okay, but I'm ready. God, this game looks so great. Let's Let's rock and roll here, team. Of course, you're watching now as you're watching Andy jumping into the tutorial right now. Going to go over the basics for Mike resources. Uh, Mike, you'll probably I don't know if you have VSync on, but you should turn it off. Okay. so that your your [\u00a0__\u00a0] responds quicker.

Uh, you you have to um click click escape and then go to prepare. Click on prepare. The prepare on the bottom left. Ah, yeah, I did the same. Okay, that's interesting. [\u00a0__\u00a0] deploying. I love the way this game looks. Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] it looks so much there's a little cartoonyiness to it. It kind of reminds me It has a cell shading. Yeah, there's some cell shading in it. Flaming Mole wants to know then why do I turn VSync on or turn it off? What What's the difference between these, Andy? What do you want your Vsync or not? Exactly. I love sync.

So it like it'll limit the it it'll limit the amount of frames you get and matches it up with the refresh rate of your monitor. Okay. But it adds a little bit of in order to turn off screen tearing and like remove the screen tearing, but then it adds some delay. it adds some uh responsiveness uh delay to your machine which you don't want. Okay. Uh so screen tearing or like VSYNC is good for you know sometimes I'll have VSync on my Steam Deck and stuff when I'm not playing like a fast Twitch shooter type deal but in this case I want it off. And I know I definitely didn't get the right uh description on that but that's all I know is VSync good when you have tearing. Okay.
