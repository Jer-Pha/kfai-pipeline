Just lying down. You're going to therapize me. Yeah. The couch is yours. You can you can stay here for as long as you want. Kevin was convinced that uh you were going to make a play to try to live in the studio.

I'm gonna say it's a very diverse space, but this was like a little bar with I mean I I think I I did a thing with Lucy where we did that and she's got it on her phone of like, \"Hi, I'm Ben and this is my first drink.\" Oh, and then it ends up with me just passed out in a cap after like 13 margaritas I've had. Yeah, I need I need to see that. That's That is That's amazing. Genuinely, I'm snoring. She I'm like, \"Ben, this is my first drink.\" And we did every single one.

Um, and I found I used to have this little case with me that I would take everywhere. So, it was like a little case that was like had fabric on the outside and plastic and I'd put all my games in and they had all the little game booklets, of course. Um, and what year were you born? 1988. 88. Okay, cool. I'm 89. That that makes sense. So rubbing it in, right? Yeah. Um uh yeah.

Like not Game Gear levels, but like it's shocking. Didn't the Game Boy take four AA batteries? It did. Yeah. That's insane. Yeah, it did. It did. And there was something really satisfying about just like putting them in. I think I became obsessed with that, but that's another story. Um, weird. Ben Star weird stuff about putting batteries in. Don't Don't think about it. It's so funny you say that because like uh it's definitely the opposite of a fetish, but I I had like a phobia of batteries growing up because at some point my mom said the word battery acid. Yeah.

And I think maybe I was intrigued. I was intrigued by it. I did have as a kid, I mean, maybe going into my teens in my early 20s, like I a story of things that I just licked. I just licked a lot of things when I when I did my gap year where I traveled from South India back to the UK in this kind of truck. Um, I made a point of like licking famous landmarks.

I mean, I feel like licking in video games there is a lineage, right? Like dating back to the the Chobot PSP stuff. Thinking about uh the when the Nintendo Switch first came out and everyone's like, \"You got to taste the Switch cartridges.\" I say bring back licking. I don't think there's enough licking in video games. Bring back lick a tongue. You know, that's me. That's me. That's me as a child. Um, yeah, licky licky tongue's a good design.

Um because I really wanted Kirby's Dreamland, but my parents got me the wrong one and I was like, \"Thank you.\" Um but obviously Pok\u00e9mon Red um was the one at school, of course. Um and yeah, but for me, this the game that I talk about a lot, maybe I've spoken about it on here, is there is a James Bond 007 game on the Game Boy that I really, really love.

Um, I think it's really cool and um, I feel very lucky to have grown up in a time where I had the Game Boy. Yeah.

I feel like uh so many of them were trying their best to just emulate what consoles were still very much figuring out. Yeah. And to go back to it now, it's like it just feels so so so like archaic, you know? Well, you like going back to, you know, I was talking to you the other day about Tony Hawk's Pros Skater.

So, if you've seen any like Kazan trailers recently, you'll hear there's a there's a thing that they're doing in the movie called Boss Week where it goes, \"Hi, I'm Ben Star, the voice of Kazan.\" And this and it's this really kind of um weird thing where the they the team have been so responsive to me been like, \"Oh, cool. We can use Ben to promote this game as marketing. Yeah. As marketing. Again, that goes back to being authentic where there's a value to that because people trust you, you know, because you play",

And if if you're if you if you've played it for an hour and you're still playing it, you'll become obsessed over it. And I know a game is good when I'm pulling out a pen and paper and working out puzzles and piecing stuff together.

Um, but I think Riseze does some really interesting stuff where it takes the same idea and it transposes it into kind of a brutalist 1970s kind of uh world. Um, and you know, this is a very kind of like I think it's like 1870 or something when it's set um in a fictional world, but it's it's the way that this game can tell stories in in unique ways. And it takes the mechanics that it learns from the first game, and you can see kind of the graphical upgrade and how the the visuals have changed, but they do a thing where at the end of each section, you don't just complete the scenarios, you have to then explain what you've seen over the four",
