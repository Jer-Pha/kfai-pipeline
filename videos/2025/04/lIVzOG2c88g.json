What a game that is after my heart. I feel like once I actually beat the game, my score could very well go up. Right now I'm at a nine out of 10. Yeah, I think this this is a 10 out of 10 masterpiece. It's going to take a lot for any game to take away kind of game of the year crown from this game for me this",
