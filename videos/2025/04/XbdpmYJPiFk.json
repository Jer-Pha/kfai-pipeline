It's Mike and Nick in the afternoon and we're back on a lovely Monday with a very special sponsored stream for today's afternoon broadcast. Nick, we're teaming up with our friends over at Nvidia once again to show off all the coolest, latest, and greatest tech with their GPUs. And today we're playing Allen Wake 2. I'm excited about this. Yeah. Uh because this is not a game that you would naturally associate with me. Uh, but I pic I picked this because I have I have heard people talk about Alan Wake for a very very long time. I know it's mostly a story driven game. I know there's uh it's it's not a vibe that I would naturally gravitate toward uh because it's not a first-person shooter and all that jazz, but I something about this is intriguing to me.

I I am just like you. I have not played Alan Wake 2. Uh, of course, control. Did you play some control? I played some control. Super awesome. They call this the remedy verse now because control, not directly tied to it, but like it's got some it's got some entanglement here that you'll get to see. I like I like things to be entangled. Yes. And it's exciting to see what this team with remedy and of course Sam Lake have created with Alan Wake 2 returning after so long. The question was, can they bring it?

So Nick, before we kick it off, Yes. usually we have Andy talk about the visual triangle and how you don't have to sacrifice frames to of course win games, get the very best picture quality, and get the best out of your performance here, right? You don't have to sacrifice thanks to Nvidia GeForce and RTX, right? RTX on with the LSS4 now uses all of the power of your GPU to be able to multiply the frames to get you more frames without sacrificing the picture quality that you know you want so bad. That's why we love them. So, let's go over to options. Let's turn that thing on, you and I. We're going to go into the settings, you and I, and we're going to turn on DLSS4 and",

And so as you take a look on your screen right there, you have resolution upscaling TLSS right there. You can use the frame generation 2x, 3x, 4x. Of course, us being on the 5090, we can crank that all the way up to the 4x if we want to get the most frames possible and still keep that visual quality that we want. Of course, if any kind of funny best friends out there want to learn more about Nvidia and what they're doing to give you the very best in your video gaming, you can type an exclamation point.

Look at I love that they give you the little spot. This is what it's going to look like. I can't wait to feel this global illumination on high. Heck yeah, ladies and gentlemen. Now I have the anxiety though, Mike. Yeah, there's two things that give me more anxiety than anything in this office.
