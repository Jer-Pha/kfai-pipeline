I take them, I answer them, I put these videos out, and then I talk to you about what my responses are. The first question on the first ever Gregway comes from Kevin. Let's see what Kevin has to say. Hi, Greg. I'm Kev Neil from Canada. This is Booker the Bass Hound, also from Canada. I don't trust in him. And we were both curious as to what your favorite television show that's currently on the air. Ours is obviously Doctor Who. We want to know what yours is. Thank you. No problem, Kev. Obviously, my favorite show is No, that's a that's a cat house. I don't It's Newsroom developments in Sanford, Florida in the investigation into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin over on HBO. I like that newsroom a lot. I'm happy it's finally back. Will Makavoy, he's out there. He's this Republican, but he's he's, you know, he's like a moderate",

He's this Republican, but he's he's, you know, he's like a moderate Republican. He's not crazy Republican. He's out there laying it down. What's happening on the news? He's going to lay everybody out. It's got good characters here. And this is the problem. Newsroom doesn't get enough care. It does not get enough credit. All these people are always saying, \"Oh, people don't talk this fast in real life.\" I talk pretty fast. I don't say anything intelligent like they say on Newsroom, but I talk really fast. That should count for something. Also, I enjoy Spider-Man a lot. There's not a lot of New Yorkers swinging around on webs, but I'm able to enjoy the show. Why aren't you? Plus, I just like the characters, right? I mean, like Mac's cool. I I wish she her and Will would get together, but I'm one of those guys who just cheers for, you know, the couples to get",

I know I was going to have to wait like four seasons, then they're going to get together and then the show kind of runs out of speed or gas, I guess. Not speed. Speed's a drug. Don't do drugs. But, you know, it'll it's one of those things where I I I like Maggie a lot. I like Jim a lot. Their whole thing in the first season, right, when they were trying to get together, I was like, \"All right, this is this is really cool. I like where they're going with this.\" Then the whole Sex in the City bus thing happened, they they seem like they're going to get together, and then she immediately just defaulted back to that one guy. I was like, \"No, not not a fan of this.\" And so this season I was afraid we're going to get more of that. It seemed like we were",

Then Jim hooks up with this [\u00a0__\u00a0] on the road like on like first off. Also this shows how stupid the press is about these goddamn tours for presidents, right? This is a dog and pony show. Romney is just going to talk to his talking points. Not going to answer any of your questions. I'm sure Obama's the same way. But you know this is my video, not Collins. And I'll tell you who I like a lot on the show. Olivia Mun. I didn't I didn't I watched G4 here and there. Of course I had to keep up. I I appeared once or twice. I never I never worked with this Olivia Munch fella. Never never knew what she was all about. I'll tell you what, she's dynamite in the show. Great actress. Like her a lot.",

Great actress. Like her a lot. Interesting character. This Sloan, I like Sloan a lot. I want to see more of Sloan. I'm glad she's getting a bigger part this season. Also like Charlie. Charlie's like that one editor y'all want. He's he was in Law and Order, but I only watched SVU, so don't know much about him from Law and Order, but he's good. Shush. No. Portello, don't do it. That it. So, yeah, if you're not already watching Newsroom, I'd watch Newsroom. It's It's fun. It's It's, you know, what you want. It's what you want TV journalism to be, right? Like, I don't even watch TV journalism all that much. I don't watch the CNN. I don't watch the MSNBC anymore. I used to try to watch it, you know, but I don't know.

When I was going to journalism school, you getting all in depth with articles and in depth with, you know, sources and stuff and you watch these sound bites on the CNN, on the Fox News, it just isn't good enough. It isn't isn't what I want. Isn't the in-depth reporting, but Will Makavoy over there in that news. He's giving the kind of feedback, the kind of uh leadership role I'd like to see more anchors do. So, I highly recommend Newsroom. Also, get a real dog. So, like I've said before, if you want to be part of Gregway, what you need to do is leave a video response. side then call the questions from there. Now mind you I don't approve the video responses. I put them in a separate playlist then you know say ignore so that you don't see as a viewer what might be coming as a future question.

You screwed up bad but for the rest of you from now on know this is how it's going to go. However, I also take the YouTube comment on the video itself. Today's comes from Zucha. He says, \"What is with the weird gray spot on the back of your head?\" He's talking about that. Got that weird spot on my head. Well, Zucha, you might have caught it a little while ago. I put up this video here. Um, I had cancer and when my hair grew back in from chemotherapy, had that on my head, you jerk. How's it feel now, huh? Probably feels pretty bad picking on some guy who had cancer. Had no hair, grew back in. Used to have a lush head of brown hair. Now I got a whole bunch of grays in. I got this one spot over here that's all white. You sick",

Three things that I always remind me that I had cancer because you can forget about it, right? Whoa. God's talking to me. Three things that remind me I had cancer all the time. White spot on the back of my head. Had never been there before. The hair grew back in. Doctors say it's totally normal things like this happen. Of course, I would have loved to have like the rogue stripe, have the Anna Pacwin thing from the X-Men movies, but that didn't happen. Number two, I I got this weird thumbnail.

But, you know, in my day-to-day life, I kind of forget that I ever had cancer. It's like it's funny thing about that story, right? I was more psyched that I was about to put out these videos that we were celebrating one year with a conversation with Colin. that I didn't think that uh oh hey you announced you had cancer a year ago because it seems so long ago seems like an alternate universe. I forget all the time that I actually had it and then of course I see the spot on my head when I'm talking to Robert Kirkman. I see the thing on my hand when I'm killing vegetables.

I don't like these forced things where you're just like, \"Oh, you're all like, \"Oh, man. I want to get more views and I want to talk.\" It's not about getting more views. I'm happy with the subscribers I have. I want to reward you guys. I want to talk to you. I don't get enough chance to do that.

Make sure you leave video responses with your question. And then of course, Monday is up at noon. Tuesday and Thursday, a conversation with Colin. Wednesday and Friday, more Greg Ways. I'll try not to be so annoying with that in the future. That newsroom is awesome. Don't Don't underell it. Too many people out there underelling it right now. I think last season was better.
