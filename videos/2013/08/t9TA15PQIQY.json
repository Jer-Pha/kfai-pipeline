This doesn't interfere with anything you'd normally get. Uh, I just checked Twitter and holy god, 100,000 of you now follow me on Twitter. I wanted to offer my personal thank you to you that I mean, I talk about it all the time. I hope I hope I talk to you enough about it through the cancer video or through Beyond or however you know me up at noon a little bit that's more scripted but I mean like the the way you guys support me and gals support me is just so overwhelming like thank you you know I talk about all the time right that being on the internet talking about video games having these videos having a conversation with Colin working at IGN of course doing beyond like I live my dream every day and the only way that's ever possible is because of folks like you supporting me and following me on Twitter and leaving comments",

Like I just want to have a conversation with you. I want to entertain you through up at noon. I want to give you something to listen to while you work. So I do the podcast Beyond and stuff like that, but none of that works. None of that does anything. None of that goes anywhere if you don't like, subscribe, share, follow, all that stuff. So like I'm incredibly blessed at the life I get to lead, you I get to live in San Francisco. I get to travel the world talking about video games. I get to be on camera. I get to interview movie stars. I get to have a dog named Portillo who barks way too much. But it's all because of you. You know what I",

But it's all because of you. You know what I mean? Six and a half years after starting at IGN, my life is exponentially better than it ever has been before. And that's because of you guys. And I won't ever forget that. And I hope you I talked about this the other day on a podcast I was on uh uh PlayStation radio PlayStation if you want to go follow. I was talking about it on there. You know what I mean? Like above all else, I hope that I make you proud. You know what I mean? Like I got popular at IGN because I think I came I was one of the the first people to come in after, you know, like the old guard people who founded the site who came in as like I grew up on this. I grew up on IGN, EGM, all this stuff. And all I've ever wanted to do was do it. And so I came in with that. And I was very public about that story. And I've been very",

And I've been very public about everything I ever go through in my life, whether it be, you know, divorce, uh, cancer, uh, whatever, you know, love in general. And so I think I think that's why people connect with me and like why you supported me because clearly I'm one of you, right? Like this is I applied at IGM 13 times, got hired on the 13th attempt. like that's not lost on people like that. You you've probably done that too. Maybe you haven't, but you've thought about it or something. And hopefully you see me as that surrogate who's been able to do that. And so that's why I work so hard. That's why I make videos like this. That's why I try to answer every tweet. That's why I am incessantly creating content for you because I want you to know how I I won't take this opportunity for granted. I won't. And so",

That's why I am incessantly creating content for you because I want you to know how I I won't take this opportunity for granted. I won't. And so that's pretty much the summation of it all, right? Is that I don't do the videos. I don't do the tweets. I don't do the interaction. I don't do the IGN stuff for money, of course, or for fame or anything. I do it because I love having a conversation with you guys. And I love the fact that you want to have that conversation with me. So let's keep doing that. All right. Watch up at noon every Monday. Tuesday and Thursday, conversation with Colin. Wednesday and Friday, Gregways. Twitter 247 until I find your pal the bug. Yes, that was a Spider-Man 2 quote. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much. I'll see you soon.",
