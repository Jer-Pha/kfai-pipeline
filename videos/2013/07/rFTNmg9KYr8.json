Welcome to a conversation with Colin. I'm Greg and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at him, and we talk it out for your amusement. If you like that, like the video, share it with your friends, subscribe to us. I like you to do this, by the way. That I've been practicing like 50 episodes with you now. Conor, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is Walmart from Kevin Crumb. The old Crumb Bum. Crumb Bum. You like the Walmart? You hate the Walmart? I think Walmart's great. Walmart is awesome. Um, so Walmart's a product of the market. Yeah. And that's basically it. Yeah.

Now, you can make the argument that they're um anti- union, which they are. Yep. So am I. And that they uh are they they don't pay a living wage as it were to some some of their employees, right? They're associates. Sure. Sure. That could also be argued. My argument is this is the free market in the United States and you don't have to work at Walmart. Yep. So, you don't have to shop at Walmart. Yeah. And you certainly don't have to shop at Walmart. You do because it's much cheaper than everything in in in your area. And how do they do that? Because they they have they are masterminds of production and delivery, right?

It's an like they are like I've read quite a few books about Walmart and they're just really wellrun. Like it's just like a really really great idea for a shop. I think what kills me about Walmart and used to eat me up was when I still lived in Columbia. I worked at a daily newspaper and I would write these stories about small surrounding communities were about to get a super Walmart and there would be these protests against Walmart, all the local businesses, all the towns people how they didn't want this Walmart. And for me, I never understood how they thought this worked that if you love your local hardware store so much, don't shop at Walmart. Don't",

If you buy it from your local hardware store, they keep going. But people didn't get that. They they didn't want the idea of having to compete. You know what I mean? Like maybe I'm just, you know, a city person who loves the internet. But for me, Walmart has beaten the mom and pop store at what they do because they can get the supply so fast. It's always there. You don't have to walk in and get something ordered to you. It's always going to be there. Now granted, the internet has now beaten Walmart where I don't even I I mean, granted, there's no Walmarts in San Francisco, but I order everything off Amazon, right? And get it delivered right to my doorstep. Even if I live far away, I would do that still. If I was around a Walmart, I think I'd be more",

If I was around a Walmart, I think I'd be more inclined to do that. But you'd go to these protests and these people would be out there saying they don't want this in their community. Well, no one's forcing you to use it in your community. Your your local community stores can still exist if you choose to shop at them over the others. Yeah, that's exactly right. I mean, so vote with your wallet. Yes. Like I I'm impressed by Walmart because they see ahead of things. Like they're they're always ahead of the curve. Like for instance with e-commerce like they nipped that in the bud not not only having like their own e-commerce shop which is actually quite successful but that they like started to initiate new things into like their bigger stores where it's like now it's a supermarket too and like and like you go there like you can't buy food",

What I really respect about them when you read about them is that they what is it? Bentonville in Arkansas. Bentonville, Arkansas. Like their headquarters is in Bentonville, Arkansas. And like they still are in these like [\u00a0__\u00a0] buildings. Like their campus is like awful. Yeah. Like they like it's like old like they are like fierce about like not spending money.

And um they've revolutionized in many ways um uh products that you see in stores. A good example that a lot of people don't know about is deodorant. Like Walmart revolutionized the way deodorant is displayed on the shelf. Did you know this? No. So deodorant used to come in cardboard boxes. Do you remember this? Like you'd buy like a a bottle of band and it would come in like a a cardboard box and a box would take about like 10% more shelf space, right? Yeah. And so Walmart was such an economy of scale that they went to the deodorant manufacturers, many of whom were selling more deodorant at Walmart than anywhere else,",

And since we have to change for you, we're changing for every everyone else, too. And by the way, that like also like cuts down on cardboard usage and uh drove the cost of cardboard down. So, um you know, because those cardboard manufacturers are now desperate for business because they no longer had the deodorant companies to buy their cardboard from.

Like these mom and pop shops are great and Walmart kills them because people don't practice what they preach. Yep. That's once the Once the Walmart is in the like once you know that you can go and get a head of lettuce for a dollar instead of $3, you're not going to be able to justify it to yourself to go get the head of lettuce for $3 anymore. And that sucks that like a a buyer for a supermarket that doesn't have the scale and reach where they can like literally make a penny on every head of lettuce and they must make 50 cents on every head of lettuce. That sucks. But that is the that is what happens. This is proconsumer. You know, Walmart is good for the consumer.

I I I I just think that like the people that are against Walmart are the same people that are against like the market itself because the Walmart is just Walmart is just the product of the market, right?

Like they're so on top of their [\u00a0__\u00a0] that like and they keep their prices so low that when someone buys something at a store, this information goes to Bentonville immediately and they're like ordering new [\u00a0__\u00a0] So there's never like there's like they",

Like maybe this store goes through a lot of laundry detergent, but like not every store needs laundry detergent. This store in Louisiana goes through a lot of laundry detergent and they know and they have algorithms that figure that out like that. So there's always a steady supply of things that the people need in that community. Like it's very impressive. Very impressive. And you know like you know haters be damned like Walmart the success of Walmart kind of speaks for itself. I think good conversation Kevin Cran.
