It seems like there may not even be dlc for the game, and there is no movie, anime, car, etc. Why do you think this is the case? Where you guys approached by square to do another big presentation like you did for final fantasy? - Triss\n00:32:15 - Do you think with Pokemon Let's Go being on a console with an actual online infrastructure, we'll get bigger and more significant DLC than simple Mystery Gift Pokemon? - Tybo215\n00:34:45 -  Is it me or is there a lack of African Americans in the gaming industry's main outlets? I would love to see more perspectives from people of color not just African Americans where should I look? - Black Caesar\n00:39:45 - Why are so many of the KFG Showcase news being posted on news outlets without mention of the event? - Braulio\n00:40:55 - Why does Kinda Funny give away games during the Morning Show, and not during KFGD? - Tiziano \"tee-zee-ah-no\"\n00:43:20 - Listening to all the Tetris effect and beat saber talk got me jacked to buy a VR unit. During the discussion, Kevin mentioned he was playing beat saber on oculus but you have been using the PSVR unit.
