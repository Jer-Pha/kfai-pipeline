What are your opinions on it and what can we, as fans, do to tell PS not to censor our games,in a respectful manner of course?\u201d\n00:24:45 - Smash DLC Done, Decided by Nintendo - Sakurai on Twitter\n00:29:30 - AsherMerlin - \u201cWhy is it so hard for some people to acknowledge that there are people out there that need a single player element to a game in order to be excited and want to play something\u2026\u201d\n00:32:20 - Riot Games Lawsuit: Gender Discrimination - Cecilia at Kotaku\n00:37:04 - Assassin\u2019s Creed Continues to Be Fucking Awesome, Andrew Reiner at GI\n00:41:50 - Out today\n Reader mail   -\n00:43:40 - Ignacio Rojas - \u201cCould it be that Bioware is ready to announce the next Mass Effect project?\u201d\n00:48:30 - Kevin is my dream daddy - \u201cwhy is it ok when Jason Schreier leaks information\u201d\n00:43:40 - Ignacio Rojas - \u201cWhat\u2019s good, Greg and [insert cohost name here]! Another year and another N7 day is around the corner. Yesterday, BioWare sent out a tweet that reads \u201cWhat does N7 mean to you? #N7Day\u201d. Could it be that Bioware is ready to announce the next Mass Effect project? Is this a tease for the long long rumored Mass Effect trilogy collection?
