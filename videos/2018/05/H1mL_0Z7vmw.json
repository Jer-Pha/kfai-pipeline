Is it the same when someone is touring the press circuit to promote a game? For a recent example, did you pay Cory Barlog to appear for the God of War Spoilercast; or was he payed from Sony\u2019s end for the marketing? Or possibly both? - MaDogNik96 (from Massachusetts)\n00:37:27 - Are you disappointed that we won't get to bring Spidey to off-island NYC landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, etc.? Or do you think it's better move for them to keep the game more contained?  - Dylan Haas\n00:39:44 - What is the likelihood of Microsoft having the big third parties (Rocksteady etc.) announce on the Xbox stage that their game will be on Game Pass alongside its regular XB1, PS4 and PC launch? - TheSilentGamer\n00:42:25 - Am I an asshole for playing games on easy or very easy? - Thanos\n00:43:33 - I just received a microsoft E3 briefing invitation and was wondering if you guys thought it would be worth a weekend trip from NYC to go? - Tyler from NYC\n00:46:55 - Why is no one talking about Days Gone, with all the E3 talk the last few days?  - Josh Hagood\n00:50:50 - What if the reason CD Projeckt Red's E3 showcase is referred to as \"an RPG\" (instead of \"Cyberpunk 2077\") is because the name of the game has changed? - Chase Schweitzer\n00:52:13 - Squad Up: Ian H.(PS4) Cptn_Chronic417\n00:53:15 - You\u2018re Wrong\nTomorrow\u2019s host: Greg and Steve Gaynor\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunnygames?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunnygames\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller and Tim Gettys talk about the biggest stories in Video Games.\n\nBackground Wall Art by Orioto - https://www.facebook.com/OriotoPosters/",
