Mario who I haven't really played that much in the past now has a dunk so use down a in midair he basically jams down with both feet and it spikes players and we have play Smash Brothers I mean I want to win every match but mostly I just want to dunk people oh yeah like I you know that's and I haven't used dr. Mario all that much in the past because I I'm gonna play as Mario I want him with his forward smash yep dunk now all of a sudden I'm gonna be able to go and play his out there instead of doing the cyclone he's basically dunking so that's just one but honestly hopefully people have gotten a chance to grab their favorite",

Sakurai's vision because he is a visionary and obviously he is a student of not only Nintendo games but video games in general and so when he's going to pick a move it's not only well this move would would fit in with his characters move said this move fits in with the balance of this character so it's a fair fighter but also what is the history you know what game did this get pulled from what like one scene that happened in a Kirby game you know back in 1989 that I'm gonna pull this one move in from he thinks about all that stuff and so it comes down to essentially him just",

Sakurai confirmed that for us that there will be a final destination this one is yeah this one is just themed after battlefield for this show awesome I love that and then second thing there's a lot of quality of life things that are being added to",

Nintendo get an optimum let him know can we somehow save a setting so that when you go to play the default is stalkin not time oh good question I I will I'll run that up the chain yeah that's the way I prefer to play too so yeah it's a there's a writer want me to play but no items fox only final destination thank you very much yeah oh no thank you thank you much for being here",
