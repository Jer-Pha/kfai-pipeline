Would you agree the gap should be widened? Are games consistently really that good? And if so, when does a 7 become a 6 and a 9 become an 8?\u201d\n00:46:20 -  - Sonorith: \u201cDoes playing and (ideally) completing a AAA game like Spider-Man (Or Mario Odyssey, Wolfenstein 2, and AC: Origins all on the same day last year) take away from your excitement for the release date?\u201d\n00:50:10 - Squad Up: CCMG12: Spider-man is almost here.  I\u2019m franticly trying to get the platinum on Ghost Recon Wildlands and am only 4 away, two being the online trophies.  If you can help me get them, that\u2019d be awesome.  I have a 1 year old daughter so gaming is usually during nap time or after she goes to bed and a mic generally isn\u2019t an option, so if that\u2019s all cool with you, hit me up.  I\u2019d greatly appreciate it.\nAlso, if you just want to chat games and stuff, i\u2019m always down to adding more friends.
