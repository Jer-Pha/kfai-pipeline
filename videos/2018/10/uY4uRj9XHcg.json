I know we're likely a long time away from public access, but how do you think this platform would be monetized? I'm sure you would have to pay for the games by monthly subscription or individual purchase, but do you think you would also have to pay for cloud storage so the game could be held under your account?\u201d\n00:50:24 - Henry from Sydney - \u201cHey Greg and Andrea, when does ANDREA think the PS5 is coming?\u201d\n00:52:50 - Josh - \u201cThis may be an odd question but with the Extra Life stream coming up in a few weeks I was curious if you all knew of any similar charities that help with Children (or adults for that matter) who suffer from Multiple Sclerosis? I know of Ablegamers but wasn't sure what exactly their reach/emphasis is. As someone who was diagnosed with M.S myself in 2017 (and KF content helped me cope more than you may know) I would love to find out about a way for me to combine my love for games and aiding in research surrounding the disease that's changed my life forever.\u201d\n00:54:04 - Jesse - \u201cMy question to both of you though is how do you as business owners handle balancing work and life.\u201d\n00:58:27 - Squad Up: durgflyhart - psn - Raymond - \u201cy I\u2019d like to squad up on PSN, for Preta: Vendetta Rising.
