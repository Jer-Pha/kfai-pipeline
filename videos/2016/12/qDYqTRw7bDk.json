And I it feels like a, you know, good horror movie. It made me jump at one point when the mannequin fell down. Now I got the bad ending, but I'm getting off track. You can go play this on PSN. Um, but trying even the different control schemes, right? Because there's the one where you have it and you can just you free look and you use the stick to, you know, actually move your orientation, but you can look around however you want to.

I was saying that I was a little bit sick off of just free the free motion, whatever. I talked about smooth controls during the PSX panel and kids have hit me up since then to say I should try, you know, dialing it from 30\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 to all these different ways and that might do it.

So, it won't be I'm just worried that people are going to get it in their head that this is a full-fledged 8 hour horror VR game and then they're going to get it and it's going to be harder to do that and that's going to blow up in their face.

Yeah, that was my I I talked about I think on the panel, right, where I got getting into the X-wing and turning around and seeing the R2 unit back there. Like that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] dope. And it was talking to me and chipping around. But I mean, it's just, you know, obviously VR, we've talked about it so many times being this amazing immersive thing, but it it takes stuff like Star Wars to really up the ante. And like that's why I think the Batman experience is so good is because it's stuff that you're so familiar with that experiencing it, it it just feels right. And it's like, oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] I never thought I'd feel this in this thing that I know and love so much. Like there's like the the Shark Tank or whatever",

They're cool, but I think that the Star Wars stuff, having the Star Wars music and TIE fighters zipping around and the big destroyer coming over you, it's like that was an awesome moment. The sense of scale and stuff, it it really does feel like you're in the movies and it it's kind of a weird thing where it's a game, but it's also an experience. So, it's still in that halfway. And that's the thing about it, even from the little bit we played, right, it was the fact that it is not on rails, but it was all right, cool. I'm flying. I'm flying. All right, now we're in combat and I'm no longer moving this. I'm just aiming and I'm I can move in 360 degrees, right? Or maybe just 180 over over, you know, ass overnose kind of thing.

Wave one of VR. How does this all apply? This seems like a great application. It was fun. Uh like you're saying, like even me not being a Star Wars nerd, reaching over and hitting the button and having the little targeting reticle pop out and have it right there. I was like, that's awesome. That's really cool. My thing is I liked it a lot more than my time with Eve Valkyrie because Eve Valkyrie it just it missed that that level of oh it's Star Wars right it just like it was like all right cool the initial experience of it super awesome but then you're out there flying in space and it's kind of like all right cool this game is",

Uh it's it's attached to the other the stick, which is good, but it does the thing that old 3D platformers used to do where when you move the left stick to control your character, it also moves the camera.

And like that's the whole thing of like this is a great time for you to find someone who voice you know and appreciate and understand and go that way. Yeah. Yeah. For me, Eco was always a a great game, but I I was I think too young to love it at the time it came out. And also, I think that it was too young in the PS2's life cycle to really be able to be the game that it wanted to be. Uh, but overall, I thought it's a great game. Shadow [\u00a0__\u00a0] love that game.

Um, but I was telling Colin this like to me this game is inside in 3D and with that comes all the good and all the bad because it's very rare that games translate from 2D to 3D that well because things like camera get introduced.

But when you go out in the the the wider expansive areas and like the the big towery things, like then the scope starts to fit and all of a sudden it's like, \"Okay, cool. This is why being in 3D makes this game worth dealing with all the bullshit.\" Uh, and again, like it's a lot easier to control even like jumps and platforming in 2D than it is in 3D. Uh, and the camera all plays into that, but him grabbing ledges, why can you grab this ledge and not that ledge? the game has rules and sometimes I feel like it's not fully consistent with them and that isn't good.

Like this game is just a puzzle game. So for the the puzzles, the puzzles are great. I think that they are just as good as anything in inside from a understanding how to get through this room, understanding how to get through that room. They're varied enough where you very rarely are doing the exact same thing over and over. Mechanics from other puzzles are brought back by using a different but in different ways. Um, I like that. And I'm definitely going to not spoil anything, but pretty early on you uh get different types of um things to do, whether it's like telling him what to do or losing your little shield shield sun, whatever the [\u00a0__\u00a0] it is.

But I liked that it just continually kept adding new elements that made it feel rewarding to want to keep going. Again though, I think that this game could have learned from things like Inside where Inside was a tight experience. Gave me everything I needed.

It's like no, give me the right experience. And I feel like this it was stretched out a little bit much. Like there was a couple moments that do repeat from a uh story perspective where I'm like, \"All right, there's only I had Uncharted syndrome with a couple things where some of the set pieces started to feel repetitive.\" Um where I'm like, \"This was super cool the first time, but in Uncharted when it's like it's always the last second when he jumps and grabs the thing right before post.\" And it's like that happened in this game over and over and over and over like how many times are",

But then it towards the end it gets amazing from a story perspective, not from a um gameplay. Gameplay is consistent through the whole thing. Was the ending awesome? I I've heard I know what the ending is. I've talked to people about the ending. I mean, I mean, again, it's one of those things where I I really believe that if game if this game was half as long as it was, it would be a lot more powerful. Yeah.

It's just that the momentto- moment gameplay can be a little bit too frustrating to be worth as long of a drawn out experience as it is.

That's the GDC awards. There's all these different prestigious award shows that nobody watches at all. So it's like, all right, there's no money there. there's no viewers there. Those those are happening. So, it's like cool. If you just want people to get their time and their awards, that's happening. Watch any award show, they're not showing every award. Like, if there's 20 awards, you'll be like get seven of them, right? Like, and I'm talking about things like the VMAs, even on the Oscars and Grammys, there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of awards being given away. And most of them aren't televised because then you're going to be going down the list of best VFX in a TV show, and it's like that's so specific that there's not time to show",

Uh I think that focusing on the trending gamer is really important despite the internet being like, \"Who gives a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about this? Award the people because the trending gamer, it's trying to show people what gaming is as a culture and what gaming can be.\" And in addition to that, things like the the Cojima stuff where people are like, \"Oh, did he really need to, you know, give his freaking love speech to Cojima for 10 minutes and like make it so much about Cojima to the point that it's awkward?\" It's like, well, I would argue yeah, because that's trying to treat Cojima like a celebrity, trying to treat him like he matters, which will then get us",

People latch on to that. That's what trends on Twitter.

And I think that this it stands alone then because it's not quite an E3 where it's just uh messages being delivered by the people like that are making the games and that's all that it is and numbers and graphs and all that stuff.

Um, and then on the other side, they're going to wherever it is they go to get their trailers and stuff to give their opinion on the new movies they've seen.

It was inviting devs to come and talk about like give awards and and do that whole the whole like exactly what you just said. And it wasn't worth the trouble, you know, like it didn't get the the views. It just caused a lot of [\u00a0__\u00a0] storm in the comments of negativity and stuff because that's what award shows do.

But I think that is the the problem is that there is realities to this and even as simple as having developers come out that costs money. You got to fly them out.

And I I I think that Nolan coming out and taking the opportunity to say the things he said was powerful and awesome. I guess that's part of it. Maybe that's part of this why this one is I feel a step back or weird is the fact that you're right the speeches all were good and so it was that juxosition of going from Nolan's speech of like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] everyone and a lot of people didn't even like really catch I'm like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] he's talking about like he's the first ever giant video game actor to come out and be like this strike's [\u00a0__\u00a0]",

When do you want to play this game? Ideally, you would wait. Yeah. But it's not but it's not but it's not always ideal. I wouldn't even think for the DLC, but just to wait because you're, you know, the [\u00a0__\u00a0] beta tester for a month and a half when you when a game comes out. So, after that, you're going to if I was thinking specifically about Titanfall 2 recently. If you waited literally two and a half weeks, you could have gotten Titanfall 2 for probably 60% of what everyone else paid for it before you. And at that and at that point, it's like I don't know.

I mean, you know, this has been an uh an issue for a very long time for me where it comes to I think since the PS3 era probably um when the HD remasters became such a thing where I was so behind on games that I'm like, \"All right, I'll just wait for the remaster.\" Happened with Uncharted. Happy I waited. Yeah. Being able to play the collection like one to one to one was [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome.

It's like, h I do want to wait. I do want the better experience. Um and I I think that, you know, there's pros and cons on both ways. And like I I'm not even taking the sales into consideration. And like if I want a game, I'm going to pay what I need to pay to play the game. Whether it's 45, 60, or you know, $120.

John L says, \"Is DLC as we know it going to follow the Ubisoft path of removing the barriers to fully enjoy a game?\" I don't think so. I mean, how often does the DLC really ruin enjoying the game, though? I I think Prince of Persia is the one everybody I go back to all the time when we talk about this conversation where they put the real ending into DLC. You're like, \"Go [\u00a0__\u00a0] yourselves.\" Yeah. You kidding me? The game wasn't that great to begin with. You're going to do this to us. It was good. It was good. It was that.

The story stuff uh Last of Us Left Behind you. It's like that's not you're not owed that.
