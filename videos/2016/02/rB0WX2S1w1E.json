Did you wander into the wrong show? Are you sure you're supposed to be on this one? I got an email saying you gotta be here at one o'clock and I was late. Over here at the Pride of Long Island, Kyle Moriarty. It's good to be here with you, Greg. And then over here, ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together. Sean and Jake from Campo Santo. Hi. Hey. Hey, Jake. Hey. You guys made Firewatch. We did. Just you two. No. Just you two. No. We are 20% of the people who did that. Yeah, that's about right. We're not really so good at math. We're less than 20% of Firewatch. Okay. Yeah. But you did the heavy lifting. We did less than 20% of the heavy lifting. Tim Geddes has gone to Philadelphia to eat cheesesteaks and see his girlfriend.

Because you played Firewatch. I did. We all played Firewatch. Even Kevin played Firewatch. Oh, my stomach just went flop, flop, flop. It's weird meeting people who have played Firewatch because that wasn't true for like ever. Yeah. True. And now it's been true for a minute and it's very peculiar. It's very strange.

It's funny when I do it because I do my own thing. Once you've perfected it, you can lie. Yeah. Well, funny's in the eyes of the holder. I didn't find it that amusing to be honest.

How weird is it right now? Because we're recording. This will post on Friday for patrons. Everybody else, you know, cheapskates. How weird is it? It's Wednesday. Your game came out Monday on PC. Moderately weird. Tuesday on PS4. It came out Tuesday, Tuesday. Oh, see, I don't know how Steam works. Yeah, Steam works. You just push the button whenever you want. It's a green button. And you did it all on the same day. And it goes. And you go, huh. So it's been 24 hours of people playing the game. Yes. Yeah. What's that like? Really crazy. Yeah? Yeah. Really cool.

And then all of a sudden, there's tens and tens and tens of thousands, six figures of people playing it. The noise sort of hits everyone equally. So you can kind of like, it's, oh, there's 200 people. So we're all kind of like, get it. Oh, when you're on a big team? Yeah. Or at a big studio.

That said, there's a lot less weird bureaucracies slash sort of just ambiguity about, can we patch? Can we fix a thing? People have found something. And just being able to put it out. Especially on Steam, it's incredible. Although, I've never been as close to a Steam release as this, because I'm used to working at Telltale where I used to work. And I've found a really amusing thing, which is when your game is live on Steam and you want to put an update up to it, it has a drunk test where you have to type the word Steamworks in and press enter before you can submit the form.

It doesn't feel like... There's no relief moment, because you're just, the game's alive and people are playing it and you're reacting to that. So I don't know when we're going to go to the office and it's just going to feel like a normal day again. Sure. It's crazy. It's been so well received. What do you know so far about numbers? It's been, what, 28 hours, I guess, since it's been released? Yeah. We don't really talk about numbers too much publicly, but the game paid for itself already, which is pretty cool. Not too shabby.

How do you get numbers on that? You just go look at all the different seeds and torrent sites. You just go look. Go try to pirate your own game and you go like, oh. You assume that those people were just never going to play it, but it's still a staggering number. It's a staggering double digit percentage of all. There's a lot of people who are never going to buy your game but will still beat it. Yeah. Oh, well. I mean, what do you know? It is what it is.

I want to dial it back and talk a little bit about where firewatch comes from, but then also Campo Santo because I remember last time you came through, the first time I ever met you, not last time, I guess, but the first time I ever met you, you came into IGN, Big Dick swinging around. Oh, jist. Jist thunderous. Here's Walking Dead season one. I'm going to get interviewed by Greg Miller. It's during Judgment Day when we had all these. I remember that. Yeah, that was fun.

Yeah. I mean, mostly. Yeah. I mean, how do you always answer this question? I it's been a while since I talked about this, actually, because we've just been heads down on firewatch. But I mean, I was at Telltale for about eight years and I was there not from the beginning, but I was there starting with the second bone game, which was like the third thing they put out.

Like, you know, I started off Telltale was my first job in the games industry and I started off like hired as a forum mod and community moderator. And I worked up over about eight years to being a creative director, which was an incredible. That's the path. That's what you want to do. That is the most that is the most insane trajectory in the entire world. And everyone thinks that they want. I don't know how that happened, but I mean. Every single thing that I did there was learning something completely new, and then I got when Walking Dead season one ended, it was like the next logical step was Walking Dead season two.

So we know that we know that drive. You know, that was our thing. I think it's that we've been at IGN so long and gotten to this point where it was like, well, what's next? What's the next step for us? And when you look outside, that's what it was. It was this room right here. This room, this table. Yeah. We're like, let's take a giant step backward into my bedroom. Spare bedroom. I love it. Yeah, that seems all about right. Yeah.

And it's just life at every like company that is more than you wait until the day that you find yourself being like the executive manager of kind of funny and you're not actually on any of the shows anymore. Yeah, that'll never happen. His ego will never allow that to happen. A camera? Yeah, I will ruin everybody else's show. No, but that's but that's something that's very, really interesting.

And like how players would respond to it. We knew what we thought about it, but that doesn't really get you anywhere. I at least was forced to sort of think about what if this doesn't work out? Like what's next? Sure. You know, so I think like, OK, like where would I go work? Like where like where do I? Who do I call and say, hey, can I interview? Like me now. And that was really hard because it's like Jake was saying, if we want to do something, we do it. And we live with the good and the bad. And like there's no.

Deport them back to Canada. That would be such a bummer. Right. The Island where you from? What? I'm not Canadian. I'm natural born. Are you? Yeah. So I can relate. I can relate to what you guys are saying in the sense that, you know, something you said resonated with me, which is like, you can never, you know, early since anyway, you can never really go back.

I would never want to go back to like the corporate world ever again. Yeah. Yeah. Ever.

It's going to go on the internet. Like it's just the thing that you're just doing the thing you should be doing with no extra stuff.

And like a tiny weird one. But you know, like that, that, that was enough to sort of make us go, oh, actually I think we could do a way more outrageous version of that and actually try to start our own company to make video games.

And I remember having to go to the first meeting with for it and going like, I don't feel like I should go to this meeting because like my heart is like, I've already, I'm already out. So Jake and I like just got together and I was like, do you feel this way too? He's like, yeah, I feel this way too.

And like, we gave him all sorts of bad ideas, but people had the knowledge already that we, that we were planning on leaving. So we just felt like it would, it would have been really dishonest, I guess, of us to be there as creative, creative representatives of telltale when our heart was already in another place. And that, that was totally the turning point. You're right. I forgot about that. That's really awesome though, because you guys, I mean, not many people would actually listen to that voice.

Yeah. It was like, we know the things that we're, what our skills are, and that's really the only thing we were ever greenlighting.

That's what it is. That's what I meant. You nailed it. That's exactly what we were talking about. Good job. And that's the whole development of the game. Like it's going to be really exciting to make another game where a lot of the, like we don't have to build a team from scratch and we can sort of explore before having to say yes.

It'll probably be, we'll just like, we won't have to like bring an idea around as much. Um, depending on who you're saying that now. Yeah, I don't know though.

I think also the way that you receive information as a player in a first person game where there's another person who's talking to you is always, I think is really unique to like if you think about GLaDOS or Alex Vance or Atlas or Shodan or whatever.

So we were like when we knew that was going to happen, we're like, Oh, let's do preorder is before the sale because like we don't want to, we're worried about that sale. And not that it mattered ultimately, but we were worried. So that just meant like the moment, but that just meant like the moment the game went live, we just had like tens of thousands of customers, like so many customers.

You can't dual wield in this game. Yeah. And I liked that. I was like, Oh, it's the me sort of instantly kind of put me at ease. I was like, Oh wait, okay, this has got a different sense of pacing to this. This is not about action. This is more cerebral.
