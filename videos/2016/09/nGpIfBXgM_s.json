No. Why not? I It's just got It's the same thing over and over again.

It has a problem that I have with pretty much every single 3D fan game and that it just doesn't look good and it doesn't play right and the characters are all kind of sliding around in a really weird way that just takes you out of it. Sure. And it's like you've seen a lot of Sonic games do this. A lot of like these people are trying to do something good, but it's like they're just they're lacking that the polish that's necessary for this [\u00a0__\u00a0] to man. Yeah. They're amateurs.

Like, I'm sure that that's fine because that people can, uh, kind of wrap their head around that. It's a lot simpler and it's a lot easier to use tools that already exist to um, pallet swap sprites or, you know, even create new sprites or do whatever that I think people can wrap their head around. And like 3D models are rough. Even in CG, like even in movies and stuff, unless you have top quality um VFX house working on stuff, CG looks kind of shitty. So imagine with a video game where you have to animate all of that and there's so much [\u00a0__\u00a0] going on like that that's going to be a bad time.

I played through a whole bunch of like completed fan games that were just what now Mario Maker does where you can just create your own Mario levels, but they create these whole games that like actually had difficulty progressions and uh secrets and all these like different areas and stuff. And those are some of the best Mario games I ever played. There's one uh Super Mario World um Super Demo World is what it's called. And uh it it's up there, man. It's up there.

This is a game that is fun. And um I highly recommend it. I highly recommend looking into it. Uh Yoshi's Island had a bunch of ROM hacks that I got into and those are great and that's why the PSP is so good. Emulation, you can play all these ROM hacks. It's super easy to find. Have you guys ever done any fan games at all? Yeah, a few.

It was like, you know, I I find a lot of these games and when I play a lot of them when I was a kid, it reminds me of RPG Maker games and stuff like that. Um, and even Fighter Maker, which was a game, um, a little halfbaked, like why bother, you know? Like, like it goes back to the idea of like the Metroid game that was just taken down recently, which was basically Metroid 2 kind of like reimagined. Um, I'm like, I appreciate it. I appreciate the thought and the effort that's put into this. I mean, there's a lot of talent put into this, a lot of, you know, time and that's great, but what do you expect is going to happen?

It's like cuz this is like this confuses Joemo out there who doesn't [\u00a0__\u00a0] know anything and he searches for Sonic. Pokemon Uranium. Yeah. Pokemon Uranium. It's like I I guarantee you there are [\u00a0__\u00a0] people out there that thought or think that Pokemon Uranium is maybe real. Yeah. Like maybe a legit game and they you know like but it's not it's not it's not a Pokemon game. So um I like I like the spirit of it. It remind you you know there was a lot of that kind of stuff because it was really to go into like the hex I guess in like eight and 16 bit games it was somewhat easy to I don't want to say easy but like you can manage like moving things around.

And I think that's how those Mario games were made or whatever because it's it's all based on um like a cloud in Mario is basically just like a bunch of numbers, you know, and if you know if you put like H372 and then the next line 5532 or whatever, it makes a cloud like and so you figure that out and you put it's a little more complicated these days. And that's why like these 3D games you're talking about are just, you know, you need these talented people that know how to to do what they're doing. So I I think it's a cool scene, dude. More power to you. I'm not I don't I don't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] But um I feel like it's kind of wasted effort because I feel like a lot of these games get taken down or people get sued or it's legal action or at least threatened legal action taken down.

You clearly know what you're doing. So go make some money. I just think people have to kind of redirect those energies towards like their own IP. Yeah. Yeah. Know it's it's definitely interesting. I mean, well, when you look at a more uh professional level, I guess, and that's just because these are the games that made it, but you'd bring up the Street Fighter Mega Man thing, there's the Miss Pac-Man, obviously was just a hacked Pac-Man, and then Counter Strike coming from Halflife.

Thought it'd be cool for you to talk about that a little bit. You talking about open biotics and stuff. Oh yeah. No, it's awesome stuff. Um, so at Comic-Con this year, I hosted the panel that was uh DSX and what they're doing with open biotics and uh and I'm saying right why isn't saying biotics not bionics. Biotic I'm saying I'm asking you just make sure now that I'm saying it. Okay. Biotics. Yeah. Bionic is the fusion of like a man with a machine, right? And that's what that's what it is.

Anyway, it's open bionics. Um, yeah. So the idea there is this really cool meetup of the open bionics people are basically open sourcing um appendages for people who don't have arms, don't have legs or whatever. And the idea is that I you know we were talking on this panel at Comic-Con at length or whatever. And if you were if you needed an artificial limb right now it's something egregious, right? They were saying it's really expensive and we're making it cheaper. You know ours are marketkedly cheaper. And I finally asked them like what does that mean?

I think what was it? Five, I think they said five people. Five people.

But basically, they were talking about it and somebody's like, well, this sounds a lot like DSX. And then they all started talking about it and how it became this thing of when the writers and designers working on human revolution it was very much like here's where we think you know human augments are going and artificial limbs and all this stuff where it's going in 20 years and in the time of starting that idea and working on what they were doing with human revolution technologies kept growing by leaps and bounds getting crazy to the fact that you get to dx mankind mankind divided they're getting ready to put out they had got to the point where these are now this is now happening.

And Till's been blown up now because they're going to like we during our San Diego Comic- Con panel, we talked about the fact that there was a Bionics uh panel coming or trade show coming up and all this stuff. She and then she was just at the White House with all this stuff showing what it is and whatever. Um Open Bionic starts talking to DSX who talks to them. They're going back forth about how they want to make these things cool, right? That since if we can 3D print these things, we can do it super cheap. Why not make them with style? Why not make them look cool and not just have them be a hideous hook or a giant, you know, robot arm",

And so it was that the team at Idos started working with them and they on the panel was the artistic lead, right? who would basically sat there and designed the arm and the colors and what it should do and what it wouldn't do and then showed it to them and Bionics then makes that actually functional and how that's going to work and what it's going to be and that working with them then influences the game because they now see that like when you're having to do it in real life now well why would there be a screw there if it's not functional and taking that all out and stripping that down so that when you play Mankind Divided you are getting Adam Jensen the way that arm should look if it was going to be a prosthetic for somebody and put onto somebody and So the Comic-Con",

This is how we're doing it. And then yeah, now it has been this thing where it's getting all sorts of press because yeah, they were just the White House talking about it. And it's amazing to see, right? Cuz it's not implants. It's not and they definitely think they're going that direction when you talk to the open bionics people that they're going the direction of one day. Yes, it's going to be like mankind divide. It's going to be like the DSX universe where we can do that. But right now it is just sensors, you know, because uh what Till's arm I believe is just below the elbow gone.

I mean it's to the point that you know like you see I put up a photo at the Comic-Con panel with her and what she does is she always does the okay symbol and puts it over her eye and you know looks out and it's like that's the level of control she has where she can control it on a finger basis. You know what I mean? Yeah. No, it was it was very impressive. And going back to you were saying the the price of $60,000 like not only is the jump from $60,000 to $5,000 like a huge huge deal. Um that $60,000 this girl was like what 7 8 years old she's growing. So it's like that's $60,000 that you'd have to keep getting new arms like consistently new",

So it's like the fact that they are getting to a point that this is a technology that is affordable. You know, you talk to Tilly about it. Like what she's excited about, right, is that one day it's going to be she opens her closet and there are 30 arms there and they're color their colors and she can put them on and whatever her outfit for the day is going to be, she has an arm that looks like that. That's awesome. She can buy a cool blue jacket and wear a cool blue arm. No, she'll buy a cool green jacket like that. I was going to say real quick, it's incred it's incredible that like that's really expens $60,000 $120,000 expensive. I would have thought it would even be more than that. Yeah.

So, it's incredible that they're able to get the technology down to this point and you do open sourcing, which I think is really smart, too, if you're interested. It's a very kind thing because a lot of these guys that know have the knowhow, by the way, to do this stuff, not to interrupt, like they can make a [\u00a0__\u00a0] mint, man.

Like I'm sure some of the ones you've seen are they're talking about the low run one, the your base model. What is it going to be? It's incred.

Start button necessary. Select necessary for some games. But why wasn't there just a C button then? Yeah, select was weird just in the sense that like a lot of early NES games you had to use select to like actually select uh where you're going. Then you hit start and you never use it again. I I I always I always found it interesting in hindsight that no one really used the select button more, you know, like um some did, but like Mega Man for instance. Uh not you know, I always talk about Mega Man people get mad, but I think it's a good example. You press start to go through the menu, but you can't pause the game out, right?

So, um, why not always map actual pause to select for all of the Mega Man games or it was just this option that was there that no one used. I I almost feel like it's not the controller's fault. I feel like it's developers fault because there was just not enough for the games to do. Some games did use it, but um, in modernity, I would say that the, you know, on on both consoles, especially on PlayStation 4, I think they really basically got rid of it um, and made it the share button. share button, but then they replace it with another useless button, which is the the [\u00a0__\u00a0] touchpad.

Andrew Taylor aka Papa Drew Bear says, \"Do you guys think the launch of PSVR will be smooth or a mess in terms of launch titles and applications you can use with it?\" Smooth. Yeah, I feel like they they got a fair amount of stuff coming out like either at launch or you know throughout the rest of the year. The danger is in six months or a year. The danger is not at launch. Uh Sony very rarely launches with a weak library. I mean we even talked about you know I think the last time they launched with a like profoundly weak library was PS2.
