Gordon Wood of podcasting and just write as much as you can about this one topic. So, at PAX, yes, I was having a conversation. Mhm. And what it came up, it's a two-part conversation.

I'm like, I'm gonna write that down as a topic. So I wrote that down as a topic. And then I went through our pin tweets and none of them are that good. Ours are all self-promotionally, right?

Actually, I do think Yeah, we'll have video tombstones by you, Colin. Maybe can we have like one of those are they lithogs where like if you look at it from the different perspectives, it does that thing. Sure. Now, here's what's interesting. I did all this research and I was like, \"Man, this is a shitty topic. Won't do this one.\" But then it reminded me of a similar conversation I was having, and I don't think it was with the same person again, but he basically this person was saying, \"I wish I spoke like Mark Twain.

I wonder if those people still exist, but there's it's like everything else. There's too much content. Just like so many people come up to us and like, \"Man, I'm a big fan of Kind of Funny.

That is my question. Yes, there the two most quotable people in American history are Ben Franklin and Mark Kanye West. Oh, and Kanye West. And they they both existed in in a time when uh a lot of people couldn't even read. And then uh even less so Mark Twain's time than Ben Franklin's time, but there was an illiterate part of the population. And then the they you know people read newspapers or had books like",

So, um, I really do think it's an and Mark Twain was a like, you know, Ben Franklin's like a legend in in his time. Ben Franklin was a [\u00a0__\u00a0] legendary man. Um, like a a renaissance man. Him and Thomas Jefferson both. We should have listened to him about the turkey. We should have the turkey should have been the national bird, which would have been awesome.

No, no. saying that like in America like Franklin resonated with people long before he was a founder because he was but but his lasting reverence was because he was indeed like a founder and a lead diplomat of of the cause. And then I think Twain was you know Twain you know uh is I everyone loves Mark Twain and and I but I feel like that's another thing. If Mark Twain existed today Mark Twain probably wouldn't even really be fully an author. He probably do podcasts and u Mark Twain was just smart, right? He was a man of his time.

That's why um you know, I was reading about the the moon landings this weekend and we were talking about them in the car last week and uh you know, 500 million people in 1969 watched the moon landing uh live and with the exception of like the Super Bowl and a few other things like you're never going to have that kind of people engagement. In fact, if we went back to the moon and we went to Mars, I bet you the number of people watching it would be about equivalent compared to the the the global population is today or whatever. Sure.

Yeah, that was a series. This was I forget what it's called. I'll look it up in a second, but it was really cool cuz they just talked to all the surviving astronauts. Um, and they were like, \"What, you know, tell us it's basically just about that first landing and like the events that led up to it and then some of the a few of the events that led to, you know, another attempt at like and they they they like it doesn't really focus on Apollo 13, anything like that.

Apollo 13's fascinating just because they fixed that ship with the [\u00a0__\u00a0] they had on. No, I love Apollo 13. I'm just joking. Um no, it's okay. You don't like space. It's fine.

But because I don't think we have an intellectual curiosity the way they used to because that's all they had back in the day like to entertain themselves.
