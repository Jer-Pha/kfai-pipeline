It reminds me a little bit of journey in a sense I think journey was a little more overt about what it was about but I agree It reminds me that in the sense that it's like kind of up to interpretation I think that what I really liked about it was The fact that it is open to interpretation, but as I said on the games cast I think to Such a deliberately made game that I can't help but really be enamored by it.

It's not like a very hard It's not a hard core puzzle game. You were running your head into the wall getting frustrated with it And I like the little secrets too because I don't know if you got all the trophies. I got all the trophies in the Each trophy you can actually beat the game without getting any trophies at all. Yeah, but I got each of the trophies I'm including like the final gold trophy and I like how it opens up and exposes parts of the game that you would otherwise not See and one of the parts I really love is the part with the dogs underground with the the torch Did you do that part?

Yeah, I It's very early it's very preliminary of course, I feel like Championship Edition the original one which we loved what a fantastic game that was on ps3 and Xbox 360 There was a simple hook to it there was a simplicity to it pac-man simple and So you could kind of wrap your head around what the game is It's not like this overarching kind of like trying to be more than it is It's just a little bit of a spin on pac-man.

Yeah to play it and I'd like to go back to it, but I just wasn't wasn't drawn How much time would you put into pac-man 250 or just 256? I didn't play 256.

Championship Edition did back in the day, but then this was even a different take on that or you know I mean changing up what pac-man is code for 256 right downloaded it, but I don't think I yeah I remember Brian Altano told you one day.

I would like to discuss the representation and portrayal of African Americans in games I have been very excited with the imminent release of Mafia 3 and watchdogs 2 not just because they look fun But because I get to play as a very underrepresented race in video games me being half African American and half Hispanic I find myself sometimes wanting to play as characters that I could relate to more I was wondering if you guys thought that if watchdogs 2 or Mafia 3 underperformed developers would think that gamers just don't want to play as an African American lead character or I'm sorry, and as a result would stray away from them.

I think all of that as we know is very intentional and I think that That's gonna craft a really nice narrative. That wouldn't be possible Were it a white person in?
