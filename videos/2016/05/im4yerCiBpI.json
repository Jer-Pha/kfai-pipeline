Number one, PlayStation four is still selling big between March of 2015 and April of 2016. The company sold a resounding 17.7 million consoles worldwide. This means that PlayStation four is officially surpassed the 40 million units sold number in just over three years on the market and keeps it at a similar pace life to date as the PlayStation two, which ended up selling some 150 million consoles before being discontinued.

The PlayStation division of Sony managed revenue of 14.3 billion dollars up 12 percent year over year with 819 million dollars in profit up 84 percent year over year. PS4 software, both digital and at retail are also up and word was circulating that Sony generated more revenue on PlayStation network alone than rival Nintendo generated throughout its entire business. Sony as a whole Sony as a whole did 75 billion dollars in sales for the year and net a profit of 2.7 billion dollars overall up 330 percent year over year. So Sony is very healthy right now.

What is certain for me is to me personally, Dark Souls is over. So rather than make another sequel, I think it's time we step in a new direction, ellipsis. Development of a new IP has already begun, ellipsis. If a from-software developer comes to me five years from now and begged, please let me make another Dark Souls, then I will not rule out the possibility to let my support start a new project, end quote. He also said they don't want to remake Demon's Souls. Interestingly, as GameSpot points out, Bloodborne was not mentioned in the review. And I don't believe for a second that Bloodborne 2 is not in development. But I don't know if they're doing it. Interesting. It sounds like they probably aren't. But that would be stupid not to do another Bloodborne. Sony owned IP",

I'm confused about Dark Souls ownership. Lay it on me. Because... Let's see. So from-software has published the original Dark Souls in Japan indicating to me that they probably own the IP. Because I was always confused about like, well, Namco Bandai publishes these games, so why would you have any say if Dark Souls continued or not? Yeah. So it sounds like there's probably some ownership there with the, you know, like that they actually can say that. Much to Namco's chagrin, I'm sure. Number 10.

News comes from an interview with Chris Harvey. Hold on a second. There's a friend of ours. With Chris Harvey from Drinkbox Studios conducted with GI Biz, he said, quote, For a big developer, they might not necessarily be overjoyed about it because of additional work they may have to go into to support different hardware skews. But as an indie developer, it's not really that big of a deal. Our games are not exactly pushing the edge of the devices anyway. So from our perspective, there might not be, there might be some additional certification stuff to make sure it works, but it's not going to fundamentally change how we develop our games for the consoles, anyway.

Well, it's not, of course, going to change the way they make their games because he says they're not pushing the edge of the devices anyway. So I don't know, it doesn't seem like it's going to affect them because they're not trying to do anything like special anyway. Their games run at their frame rates and they look the way they look.

The same report that these numbers were reported in found that the average gamer is 35 years old. Fifty nine percent of gamers are men and that 52 percent of those surveyed found games to provide the best value for their money over DVDs, music and going to the movies. So I say all of that is that first of all, I don't really believe that anything is different here either. This is within the margin of error, certainly.

Cause there's an aren't the rest all like not that bad in terms of like spoilers. Sure I can do that. Okay. All right. So it, this comes from our friends at PlayStation lifestyle net who, so basically this leaked with a bunch of screenshots and they were up on the imagers and they took, they took them and just kind of condensed them. So there are 17 hidden trophies. We don't know the nature of them. There's a platinum, obviously one last time, collect all the trophies. There are no gold trophies. Now, some of the hidden ones, one or more might be gold, but I'm not, I'm not so sure that any, there are any gold trophies on this list because the list is so extensive. Interesting. We could do the math. We wanted to figure it out, but",

So complete the game in crushing mode and complete the game in six hours or less. That's a new kind of trophy for us. Treasure master find all the treasures. That's not of course the unstoppable defeat 100 enemies in a row without dying in combat. That's a typical kind of trophy goes in the cemetery, get through a cemetery comp without killing or being seen. So there's an area that was what you're talking about. And, but I didn't talk specifically for you guys. Don't worry. Run the table, defeat enemies with a stealth attack, melee attack, headshot and explosive and explosive.

There are 32 bronze trophies, mighty five of them are multiplayer and the rest of them are single player. So the single player trophies charted, explore charted, light charted, moderate charted hard. So those are the four for difficult difficulties and then crushing, which isn't, we talked about first treasure treasure, hunter, find 50 treasures, jot this down, find a journal entry.

I thought I heard something perform 30 vertical stealth takedowns, run and gunner defeat 50 enemies from the hip or blind firing leapfrog, defeat 10 enemies in a row alternating gunplay and hand to hand, which is a typical uncharted trophy, sharpshooter complete game with 70% or higher shot accuracy.

So completed the final descent nightmare, completed, completed the destroyed dreams, nightmare, completed the wayward dreamer nightmare and unlocked all branching paths in the nightmare select screen. So that might be a difficult one. Interestingly, the one that seems to be the one that people are missing is the silver. The fact that, and that's what I'm talking about where I'm not, I don't think it's going to be that lengthy of a game, right?

Like let's get punchy, melee, five soldiers, Bomba punter, 20 bombers. My head explode, get 50 headshots. So a lot of these are actually the same as the achievements. Remember correctly.
