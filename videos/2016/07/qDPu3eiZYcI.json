Um cuz I mean it is there's a lot of things that that kind of mirror the real life with all of the the middle gear games when it comes to Kojima, but I think that this one definitely could have veered in a different direction and I'd love to know what that that is.

That's the only system I bought at launch. And it was because I didn't we I had Wi-Fi, but I had just gotten Wi-Fi. I just gotten internet in my house, like broadband internet in my apartment. I didn't have an HD TV. So, they were like, \"We're putting out this system. It's going to have a Zelda. It's going to be this new controller. It's going You flip it sideways and you're playing classic NES games.\" I was like, \"This sounds like a system built for dorks like me. This sounds",

It's something different. And then that Thanksgiving where everyone took that thing home and was like every grandmother, my mom, her husband, everybody flipped out for it and bought those. And then we talk about the terrible attach rate. They bought that and they didn't buy games. And then it was everyone's playing Wii Sports. Everybody make miniame compilations. Put them put get another Wii game out and put it with a you know a Wii a Wii remote and d and it was like as soon as that happened it was like like that was it for games with them.

Of course Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 are amazing. Of course Mad World had its moments. I liked Mario Paper RPG was all right. Yeah, Zack and Wiki wasn't great.

And that was I'd say right when Microsoft and Sony were still having shitty conferences, but they at least weren't that bad. You know, it wasn't like the joke of the show. Uh, and then it wasn't until a couple years later, like 2012, that Sony and Microsoft got good, specifically Microsoft, and they kept going, but then Sony's like, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] we got to step our game up.\" And now Sony's just top of the game with all that stuff.
