Congratulations, Tim. Episode of the Kind of funny games cast. As always, I'm Tim Gettys, joined by the coolest dudes in video games, Colin Morardi, and Greg the Builder Miller. Hey, that's me. Can you believe this 33-year-old man is single? Now, what I've done, ladies and gentlemen, is I've decided it's time to close up the Lego Dimensions Portal. It's looked bare bones too long. So, I bought this Lego Superheroes. And you opened it. You opened it like classic Greg unboxing fashion. Hey, you know what? I got to get inside of the cream. I don't care about the case. This is not okay, Greg. I'm okay with ripping it open. I don't physically understand how this happens. Some of the This was bought at VidCon. Yeah. Down at Downtown Disney.

I wouldn't have torn through it. But, it just happened that way cuz the box is already weakened. Its outer structure had been weakened by my luggage and it's trip from VidCon to here. Yeah. But I mean, like that that looks like something that Kevin would do, but not even like Kevin wouldn't even do that type of damage to the DC Comics. His hands don't have his hands don't have the growth. They don't have the pull. They don't have the power. They got the Kevin's hands got some pole, Greg. Look at them. They're tiny.

So now I'm building out that portion of the of the thing to How did you feel about the Lego Dimensions section at the Lego store? Piss poor. really an embarrassment honestly that there wasn't more there. Same thing with the superhero section. There wasn't enough. They had all they have all these generic guys and all this generic Lego crap nobody wants. But where was all the superhero stuff? Where was all the dimension stuff? You know what I mean? Like they needed more for sure. I couldn't even get every dimensions character. You should be able to get every dimensions thing there. Period. We went to Target last night, me and Kevin. Sure.

One of the moments I knew I was special to is when you brought me the Ninjago character for Lego Dimension. It meant a lot to me. There was a whole bunch of uh a whole bunch of that [\u00a0__\u00a0] There new fun packs. There's Bane. Kevin was this close to getting you Bane. No, I got Bane. Good thing you didn't get him. Yeah. Thank you. Don't worry about it. I got I got all the DC characters, Ghostbusters characters, Doctor Who character. They did have quite the Lego Dimensions thing though, which is what made me think that Lego needs to set their game. And that's why like I understand you're a little you're a little Lego story.

I do like and appreciate that you can kind of just make whatever the hell you want on top of this thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm having to come up with on the fly here as a master builder cuz like they have the play set obviously builds the bat signal in a different fashion than what I'm going to be available to. So I think I figured it out what I'm going to do. I'm going to do this. Okay. And now I can put that anywhere I want on the portal. I'm proud of you. And of course, I'm I've I was foolish to wait this long because now the story pack that will come out in September is the Ghostbusters story pack that has a new shelf for the portal itself.

I just think that it's because if if the vanity numbers all go away if everyone is hit. Yeah. So it doesn't matter, you know, then everyone loses their subscribers. Yeah. But it was funny to see those fun house idiots dip below million again. Dude, that sucks. They lost like 60k. They're dorks. They they were lying. You know, Kovic did it on purpose.

Dork focused and they just obviously had different opinions about the whole thing, but I kind of it got me thinking about the idea of back in the day there was a clearly defined AAA doublea shovelware licensed games ecosystem of everything kind of fits into into these little buckets. Sure. What is the 2016 market share? Like how does that break down and what are the categories that we can I mean I've talked about it at length on a a million different shows and panels but they all run together right and the fact that I think the middle has fallen away and I but I do think it's making a comeback but basically the middle's fallen away and that was always going to be your THQ, your license games, your door of the explorer, all these games that were just shoveled out",

Deep Silver putting out for some reason your home front the Revolution, your Mighty Number Nine. Games that are not AAA and are not Indian are in this weird space in the middle where they're they're halfbaked. And it's weird. It's interesting to see the reaction of that middle tier coming back and what people think of it cuz it has for so long been there's AAA's and there's indies and that's what it's been when when you saw THQ fall with Udraw, when you saw a bunch of other mid-tier publishers like that start clamping down and not putting out stuff and Capcom getting burned and not being able, you know what I mean? not putting out their games that they thought were going to be AAA.

And that's why like when we got asked to be on that panel and it was like it was indie verse AAA fight and it was like I don't think one exists without the other anymore. I think if it's if there's no if there's no Uncharted 4, if there's no marquee title, if there's no tentpole title, indie games aren't enough to move units and consoles and what then we're just left with these PC dorks. And then in the flip-flop of it, if e if indies fall away, are you excited? Are you reading about games every day if you're only getting six really great AAA titles a year spread out, delayed, all these other problems? Mhm. It's this weird.

That I hate even having this argument or this conversation anymore because what what are we really defining as indie? Is it that you are an independent game studio or is it that you are a small team making a game on your own? and you're getting funding from PlayStation or is it because it's that the whole thing where like well Insomniac Games then is an independent game studio, right? But they're huge and they're awesome. They have a whole bunch of different partnerships and how does that work and where does that go anymore? I mean but you know when you look across the different forms of media media I think that that is true as well like when you look at music like with rap music Drake was independent for a long time just",

You look at us, we're independent, but in a lot of ways, it's like we get to kind of coersse with people that are very not independent. So, it's like we're kind of in that same place like we would be the equivalent to uh to any of those companies. Insomn We're not cool as Insomniac yet. Yet, Ted Yach Club Games.

Um they're ahead of the curve in many ways in advancements in the way we play. Yeah. In the way we download and enjoy games like Steam. Um and so I think we can look to PC games uh for answers to both the things that that Greg had mentioned. PC gamers. Uh, first of all, I mean, something we didn't mention, PC gamers have been well ahead of the curve in the digital revolution. No one buys their PC games physically at all. I mean, that's just not a thing that happen. And it happened so quietly that console gamers didn't even notice. And so, like, while console gamers continue to cling on to the idea that they're going to be buying games in stores in 10 or 20 years and are not, PC gamers already know that that's going to be the case um, forever because they've they've they've grappled on that. So, they were ahead of the curve",

So, they were ahead of the curve there, right? uh they've been ahead of the curve in terms of the way we ingest games in terms of like you know PSN and Xbox PSN really Xbox Live was the thing on original Xbox and then Xbox 360 really advanced it and the way we have a marketplace and all those kinds of things but it was really Steam that taught us about how uh we download games easily about how we have easy discovery tools, how we have things like forums and um help desk stuff uh tied into the system how we have different pricing structures and tiers and flash sales um wishes all those kinds of things. So, they're ahead of the curve there. And I think they're ahead of the curve with the indie versus AAA thing because actually like a majority of uh PC We have to take a time out everybody. Where were we? Sorry about that. So,",

Sorry about that. So, I had to go help our landlord with his computer. Okay. So, I'm back. Yeah. Yes. So, what I was saying was that the PC to catch everything up though everyone just heard it, but I didn't. Is that uh PC gaming has been well ahead of the curve and I think they're now ahead of the curve in the indie space versus the AAA space. So, the AAA space um is well established on PC. it's been established in some form for 30 plus years on the PC space more than anywhere else. And um but I think that the exploration of price points that I was talking about on Steam, the accessibility of the games and the ease of buying games and the ease of developing these ecosystems in one unified kind of place. And I'm not talking about on a PC or Mac, I'm talking about on Steam. Um has cultivated a place where there is a",

Um has cultivated a place where there is a 99 cent game, there's a free game, there's a $5 game, a $10 game, a $20 game, $15 game. And these are all what we would classify as indie games. Um, so I think that the PC's just been well ahead of the the curve and I think we're going to start seeing that and have been seeing that seep into the console space. Um, and to Greg's point, um, I think that what's interesting is that publishers are starting to explore not the indie kind of they're not indie by nature, um, but they're but they're independent, they're exploring more independent pricing schemes. Sure. An example is Square Annex just released Adventures of Mana Surprise on Vita. Been playing it. It's fun. It's a little vanilla, but it's fun. Uh, and they're charging like 12 bucks for it. Uh Sony releases Ratchet and Clank for $40",

Uh Sony releases Ratchet and Clank for $40 brand new right out of the gate. Um Recor by Microsoft is going to be 40 bucks. Um we number nine $30. My number nine $30 retail I think $20 digitally. Um EA puts out Unravel. It's cheaper, right? Exactly. So everyone's kind of exploring these spaces and then we see Sony San Diego exploring with the freeto play or games as service model. So I think you're seeing a lot of this space. So I think that the walls between AAA and indie are kind of dissolving. Not necessarily in terms of quality because we know AAA game when we see it in terms of quality. And I think that's what we're talking about mostly. Uh cuz like a game like Ukulele for instance, which is totally independent and independently funded could be a AAA 3D platformer. So like I don't I I don't know that that word has kind of lost",

So like I don't I I don't know that that word has kind of lost its meaning. So that that's kind of what I wanted to to ask you guys about is so obviously indie AAA we have ideas in our head of what that means. But what is double A? Is that still a thing? Is A still a thing? Cuz I I remember two generations ago it very much was. Like when you look at specifically I think Nintendo is easy to look at because they have so many franchises to themselves. You can kind of delineate which is which right? You have the Zeldas and the Marios that are the AAA's. You go down to the the Mario or the Metroid and the the Star Foxes, right? And it starts going down the Donkey Kongs. Mario Kart would also be AAA Smash Bros. AAA. Mario Golf triple [\u00a0__\u00a0] a quadriple. That's the thing is like on on Game of Gregy which is coming out this week for you guys. Uh, one of the topics",

That's the thing is like on on Game of Gregy which is coming out this week for you guys. Uh, one of the topics was the rating system of movies where it's like PGR. They had to make that PG-13 to kind of explain the middle ground between the two. And I think like that is where the Mario Golfs and stuff like that would fit. Sure. And I think that as you know, time has changed and have how games have evolved a lot of the genres even have changed from that. So what 3D platformers I'm not sure AAA 3D platformer can still exist anymore. Like I think that ukulele, no matter what went into it, I don't know if it would even qualify as AAA. Well, I think it's a it's a matter of it's a matter of scale in terms of the context of that particular genre. What I mean by that is uh I think Ratchet and Clank is a 3D platformer and it's currently a AAA game. So like I do, but it's sold at a $40 price point. So I don't",

So like I do, but it's sold at a $40 price point. So I don't think we can use necessarily the price point of the game to to to say whether it's AAA or not. Homefront, the Revolution is a $60 game and that is in no way, shape or form a trip AAA game. Not even [\u00a0__\u00a0] close, you know? So, I think we have these two kind of competing things that we often use to kind of um we're conflating things and we all do it where we think a $60 game is AAA, a $40 game like kind of the A game, the $20 game or the $30 game. Like Carnival Games on Wii was a was a [\u00a0__\u00a0] sold like 10 million copies or something, but it was a piece of shovelware. Um, and then you have the indie space with the digital stuff.

And then on the other side of the scale and I do believe this that uh a studio can one one day get away with charging $100 for a game if it's so [\u00a0__\u00a0] good and so AAA that it goes beyond a $60 game yet I don't think that the $60 price point that Uncharted 4 was at makes it any less of a AAA game. Uncharted 4 is about as about asa as it gets. So um so I think it's more complicated than that. The the good the good news though is that I think that to the my point about kind of commenting about the PC space and the the kind of forwardlooking nature of the PC space is that um we are going to just get we have a der I think of of stuff of exploration right now in that price point and in terms of exploring what Indian",

So, well, so I guess that's kind of what I was thinking about is is it how much the funding goes into it into the actual game? Is it the fact of how flagship it is for the the company making it? A game like Mario Maker, not that much money necessarily need to be putting into make that game, but it is that was the Nintendo's flagship title that year. So, does that make it AAA? It's obviously not indie. You know, we we know that, but like where does that fall then? Is that where the A goes in? Is double A even still a thing?

Um, and it's easy to understand and it's bite-sized, but it's not what we would also look at as an indie game because it has such a huge reach and so much popularity that I think things start to get blurred where you're like, it's because of, in other words, you have to judge it based on like a bunch of criteria as opposed to just one.

And we specifically when it comes to indie games now, like that thing is you can use that in 10 different ways, but does it feel like an indie game? Is it an indie game? Those are different questions, you know. Um, like thinking back again to the other eras when Nintendo would charge $40 for a first party game, $50 for third party, you know, on Game Boy Advance it would be $30 for their games and $40 for the other ones. And that the the price points almost didn't matter cuz when F-Zero came out, F-Zero was not a AAA game. It had the polish.

I think that there there's a lot of complicating issues about, you know, in in when you look at it historically about trying to talk about pricing in the cartridge era because pricing, for instance, in the cartridge era, as you know, was based on the the size of the chip. Um, so you get NES games for $30 or $40 and you get NES games for $60 or $70. They got more pronounced on Genesis and Super Nintendo when you had games for $40 and you had games for $100.

Well, they're $50 I mean aaa GameCube, right? But even at a even a $40 game in 2002 is cheaper than a $60 game today. based on inflation. So that's the whole so that's the whole that's the whole argument. But there's complications like um about pricing at retail and why retail I think holds the whole structure back is also because um uh GameStop for instance I don't know the exact numbers but GameStop like GameStop's margin is is really low on new games. They probably pay something like $47 or something something like that $49 for every game. So they're charging in $60 for it but they're also have to pay their vendors and all these kind of things.

Like so there's no room for error. Um so like they'll buy a roll of toilet paper for 50 cents and charge you 55 cents for it. Like they're making like just little rips of money and they want to do volume. um the game I think there's I think at retail there's they're held back because of these kind of Byzantine what seem like Byzantine rules uh in terms of what you're paying for the game up front and then what you can charge for it on the back end.

Um, so I think that a lot of the space is going to be explored not only with indie and AAA and A and all these kinds of things uh with game types and pricing. Uh, it's all going to be explored uh digitally because then I think that gives people more room to take risks. There are few people to pay out.

I think that they were like under the gun to get the game out. So, like I think if they could have had taken that back and had six more months, they probably would have the game would have looked really differently. What I was surprised about, Tim, was when Gran Turismo Sport was announced that it's a real game.

And how many people are like the people you're talking about, Colin, who don't buy digital games have heard about Rocket League, obviously, and now it's there on a disc. They see it at Walmart.

Sincerely, Aunami Chan. That's a great example of a good writing. talking about dialogue, you talking about story. Where are we going? I mean, any what does that mean to you? Because I think from, you know, the story, I think Braid is a great answer. I think Shadow Colossus, they're well written, but then, you know, the writing, the dialogue is not necessarily there.

They bring out the worst in people. And yeah, the reason that they're kept on in a lot of places is because people go and look in the comments and they go back and look in the comments again and they check the comments again and they and it's good for for page turn. So, that's why that's why they're there. And that's not an exclusive. I think that's everyone. Yeah. No, it's",

Yeah. No, it's everyone. I I'm on kind of the other end of you. I agree that a lot of the comment sections are horrible, but that's what good moderation is is for. And it's hard. It's difficult. There's no solution to this because you can't solve people. People suck. Period. Um, but I think the comment section is for discussions. It's for like earlier in this episode, you were talking about that PC game you didn't know what it was. I'm sure people will discuss it and have I'm Yeah, our comment section are the are an exception to the rule though. And even then, I I don't necessarily think they totally are. Like there's a lot of [\u00a0__\u00a0] even in our comment sections, but that's how it is. But I think that with IGN it's it doesn't work 90% of the time, but it's that 10% of the time that I think it's worth having it",

But I think that with IGN it's it doesn't work 90% of the time, but it's that 10% of the time that I think it's worth having it because then there is a sense of community and there is a sense of having a conversation about the thing that just happened. So it's like the like this and click this and subscribe here and leave a comment below. Like so much of that is just kind of like redundant [\u00a0__\u00a0] but you could use that to actually start an actual conversation with people and and give your opinions. And I think that you can stand out that way. And I the reason people have it, yeah, it's page views. The easy business answer is there's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ton of that because people come back time and time again. And I think that there's the positivity factor of it is what wins out in terms of the page views. People come and talking all this [\u00a0__\u00a0] like Perry was talking about this at his VidCon um panel panel that he did where it's",

People come and talking all this [\u00a0__\u00a0] like Perry was talking about this at his VidCon um panel panel that he did where it's like the problem with places like IGN is they're fundamentally built on fighting. Like you're either a Battlefield guy or a Call of Duty guy. You're either a play PlayStation guy or an Xbox guy. And I think that that is why comment sections on sites like that seem so heated all the time is because it is people are arguing and disagreeing. And I think for us maybe sometimes it's better because we kind of have a slant, you know, and I think that that's why people agree. And that's why when Xbox shit's brought up, it's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] terror zone down there. And that's zone. But, you know, I just think that uh I think that overall it's on people's personal responsibility to try to be good and try to um respond positively when you see something you like down there.

Don't get involved in the bad ones and keep that going because the more people that are having positive conversations, then people are going to stop bitching about comment sections being bad and start focusing on making them better. And I think that that IGN can't make them better. you need to make them better, right? So, it's the silent majority that needs to get off the bench and go down there and say something of value and then talk to other people who are saying something of value and not fall for the arguments and the trolls that are just there to get your go to get you to yell at them.
