I want to talk about uh and I'm just going to throw it out there with a little bit of context and see what you guys think of the question and then I'll come to it if if it's necessary at the end. I I assume we'll be. Is America exceptional? And do you as an American consider yourself exceptional compared to the rest of the world? American exceptionalism is this very old idea comes from uh I mean Thomas Payne even wrote about it a little bit not that those terms but it really comes from like Alexis the Dtoqueville and democracy in America like it the idea that like something exceptional happened in America the the reviving of republicanism and the revi you know um and that there's just a special something about the United States and therefore it creates special people and special products um and special ideas and special ways and so I'm just curious if any of you guys believe that cuz the very controversial idea.

Um, American exceptionalis, if you pay attention to presidential politics, not so much this year, but in years past, this is a question that's asked about like, do presidents like did Obama and Romney believe that there's America is exceptional place with exceptional people because it inherently puts the rest of the world down, you know? So, I'm I'm interested to see what you guys think of that idea. I'll just leave it there. Yes, I think America is exceptional. I don't think it's as exceptional maybe as we drum it up to be. And I think that might be one of the reasons then people are like, \"Well, no, it's not because we America's really good at talking about how great America is.\" And when your friends do, they're like, \"Shut up, dude.\" Or even your foes do it or whatever you say that.

And I think that's part of being in America, part of the freedom, part of, you know, for us what, 30 years of hearing that bootstraps and you can do it and you can live your dream. And this is, you know, America is the land of opportunity and all these different things. I think that sure some of that is just rah politics or rah, you know, nationalism. But I think there are examples like this kind of funny in us doing a business like this that granted it could have worked in France if we were French or we were doing this stuff. Sure, probably.

Is like the best most honest attack on no you're not. You know what I mean? People in there see that. You should look it up. Jeff Daniels monologue at the beginning of the first episode of Newsroom is fantastic about um they ask about American exceptionalism and he [\u00a0__\u00a0] destroys why is America the greatest country on earth and he destroys the entire idea of why America is exceptional.

Well, that's that's always my question for you, Colin, is that, you know, obviously Donald Trump is running on a platform of make make America great again, right? Um, what what what period do you think he's referring to of greatness for for for our dear country here? I would say post war probably Eisenhower through or Truman and Eisenhower through Reagan and but isn't that sentiment a little bit false right?

The same thing with Russia where it's like the be stand out, be exceptional, celebrate who you are, do something amazing isn't what they are were being promoted, what they wanted to believe, what they were getting from birth, what they were celebrating on these the holidays where you know I mean in America it's all about America and we're all decked out in red, white and blue and we're all I Fourth of July obviously we were doing all these different things always.

I think something like four or 5% of of uh maybe a little higher than that of men aged like 16 to 50 or whatever died in that war. It's insane amount of people died in the in the Civil War us fighting each other over an old institution and we have scars of racism and all these kinds of things and we have panics and busts and all these kinds of things that are are totally like antithetical to like stability. Yet in the United States like we also developed much of the world's technology. We developed much of the world's entertainment. we develop like much of the world's culture and and and stuff like that like and there's something to be said about that. So I don't like and these things are all developed here and when you look at like the you look at the world and like what powers the world like and and this is one of the things I was saying on July 4th it's like",

We are 4% of the world's population. Google American, Apple American, Microsoft American, Tesla American, the future of cars, SpaceX the future of space exploration American. The interesting thing about Tesla and SpaceX, founded by a guy from South Africa who intentionally came to the United States and is one of the people that is like it could only happen here. And I I think I think that's the the big point is that I feel like what America is generally is everywhere else coming here to do something. And I think that there's an obvious reason for that. When you look at people that are motivated, it's them that are doing things. It's not the people that are just like, I'm here, so whatever. And when you could be born somewhere else and",

But if you're born somewhere else and like I'm I'm going to go here to do this, you're doing something. they're already a step above so many other people. So, and I feel like it also could work the other way of like if there were Americans going to other places, they're exceptional people, too. Like, I think that if you have a plan and a goal and you're getting off your ass and doing it, I think that's the most important part. And I just think because of the the symbol and the what America stands for, there is a lot of people coming here to do something. So, for them to take that step already, that means that they're a step above everyone else because they are taking a step. They You're going to win the race if you're the only one moving, you know?

And so it's not so to me it's like I look I look around I just look for the evidence right like that that America is in some way exceptional at a systemic level or in terms of a societal level. And I think the ob obvious answer on that case is obviously yes you know like people are literally still falling themselves 24 years later people are still falling over themselves by the millions to get into this country. That's not happening anywhere else. No offense no one's falling over themselves to get to Russia or China you know. No one's falling over themselves to get to India. No one's falling over themselves to get it like and to get in a lot of places in Europe, you know, like it's it's it's like there's something there's a it's not us. It's this",

And I think that's exceptional. Yeah. And so like I don't think it I don't think it I when I say that I say that with great deference to the rest of the world. like we are pieces of Germany and England and China and Japan and Russia and all the we are we are absolutely all pieces of of these places. And so the ironic thing about the United States is that it just wouldn't be what it is without the rest of the world.

But like you look at it just in terms of like the spirit of the United States I think is is contagious. And so, so I think that like America is exceptional. I don't think Americans are exceptional. I think the I think within these borders something special happens. And it's not because we're in in within these borders. It's because like there's a magic here that allows chances to be taken and all those kinds of things.

We're talking about this with education and medical systems that are way below European standards because there still is something about it here, you know?

No. But I think that like the Morardis here for generations that helped fight for those things and fight for the system certainly did.
