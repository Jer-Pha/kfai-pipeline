That's Nick Scarpino, the producer producer. That's Tim Getty's the pure one. This is Matt Scarpino from Midlife Ballers. And who's this gentleman? Jason, somebody or other should go watch his movie Hobgoblin 2 Amazon Prime. Uh, the reason we're in this different place with the weird pending set and everything else is cuz we just did an episode of Midlife Ballers, which you should go watch at youtube.com/ midlife ballers. The link is in the description, right, Kevin? See, no. Do you remember the anniversary stream we did that everybody loves so much? This is essentially the sequel. We did two hours and 45 minutes that got drunker and drunker, drunk to the point that everybody's like, Kevin, here's $80. Go get Del Taco. And somehow he came back with $40 of Del Taco.

Crunch tacos and a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ton of ice and burger um burgers. So, if you're not familiar with Del Taco, if you're not if you're not fortunate to live next to one of them, uh Del Taco is great uh fast food, Mexican food, but also burgers. So, we are actually going to unbox some of these right now as soon as everyone decides to come back to the [\u00a0__\u00a0] table. Don't wait for them. What's your problem, Greg?
