This is your show. I want to talk about Batman. I want to talk about Batman. Okay. Well, I guess we're talking about Batman. I went and saw Batman today. You were actually the first person outside of Telltale's doors to see. Don't tell him that. That he doesn't need it. You snuck him in gamer to get him in to see it just before. So let's start then.

There's some cigars, there's some drinks happening if you want them, and then there's a clock. You push the clock out of the way, you walk into the batcave, the big bat computer's there, Nick, they do the demo on the bat computer. I'm excited. I'm hearing you say this. It's getting me excited. Then I'm going to watch your Instagram video and that's going to actually really get me jacked up. Oh, you mean instagram.com/over? Yes, that that very same one. Thank you very much.

But you still I expected it to look more like how and act more like how I thought Walking Dead does or how Tales from the Borderlands does and it doesn't. It's very fluid. It's very the the cape physics are great. The look of the game is great. You can tell it's Telltale, but it doesn't feel like the negative way. That's the That's the thing. It's like we we're never going to go down that direction where we're going to look hyper real. You know, we love all the games that are going in that direction, but we we move very fast and we're episodic, so we're based on comic books. We want to go for a living comic book feel.

No, but um so we just wanted we've been saying that this is a Batman game that is just as much a Bruce Wayne game as it is sort of being in the bat suit. And that's really kind of where we're going here. We we love all the other Batman games we've seen. You know, we've loved Batman for 75 years. There's comics and movies and TV shows and games and so many artists, directors, writers, developers have really had their chance to sort of do their take on Batman. This is ours. Awesome.

Say you're like you're in the middle of a fight. In our demo, you're actually fighting Selena Kyle in a rooftop. Um, there are things that could happen in the middle of that sort of that that scuffle that the city's watching. There's like police cameras and helicopters hovering around above the rooftops. Anything that you do up there has the potential to be reported in Gotham News. And so if there's a moment between me and Selena, they're going to know about that. Everyone will know. So yeah, boy.

They're still kind of deciding whether so your decisions really do matter in that regard. So all of that stuff's happening and that's that's sort of only one half of our demo. The other half you are um you're sort of walking out into a gala after this fight and plastic Batman plastic Batman and you are supporting um uh mayoral candid candidate Harvey Dent who you're one of your best friends.

Um, and you know, it's she's watching everything you're doing and what you're saying. Got it. Um, who walks in Falonee. So that that that was the the the really cool thing is like I think from the get-go you guys have been very clear that as much as you're Batman, you're Bruce Wayne.

He's like, I know you don't like doing I don't think he knows you're Batman. I know you you don't like doing these parties or whatever, but play along. And then when Falcone shows up, he he is like immediately starts pushing buttons of like being a he's a dick obviously. He's a crime lord. Everybody knows it. So, when Bruce goes to meet him, like he puts out his hand to shake him and you can shake it or not shake it and the entire party's watching. That's the thing. Great.

Well, it's role playing is kind of that's up to you. like we're letting you play Bruce and play Batman the way that you kind of want to play him. It kind of goes down that lane where he's not really sure who he is and he's still figuring out like he's dedicated towards his nightly crusades and he knows there's a purpose and he knows that this is justified and this is his own version of justice, right?

That's what I dug about, not the Falcon stuff, but in terms of identifying what Batman you're going to be, even with the conversation with Selena when she's in her Catwoman outfit, you have that option of like why do you do this? Like she says that it can be like the city needs to protect her or it's about it's it can even be about like hope for the city or about fear for the criminals or like you can start to see where you he's malleable to the way.
