Some people like it, some people don't. I played it for like an hour or so. I'm going to get back into it. I enjoy it.

So, first up is Laura Meal, who's EA's global publishing head. She said, quote, \"I perceive it as upgrades to the hardware that will actually extend the cycle.

There's a spelling error here. Fix it. I have an 11-year-old son who plays a lot of games. we change consoles and there are games and game communities that he had to leave behind and go to a different one.

They came out in droves. Great to give out their forgotten PlayStation games of the week. And I picked this one from Super Cberus. Hey Growlin, a relationship name. I've got a suggestion for this week's forgotten PlayStation game. One of the PSP's hidden gems, Pursuit Force. Wow. Big big great big. I had no idea that this game exists until it was given away for free as part of the welcome back program after the infamous PSN outage of 2011. So, I decided to dust off my PSP and give it a try back then. It's a surprisingly fun, goofy action title that was way ahead of its time in variety of gameplay and badass animations like jumping between cars in the middle of a chase or smoothly handcuffing criminals on foot. We're pretty impressive. These were all pretty impressive for early PSP games. Thanks, Super Cerberus. PS, RIP",

They didn't they don't deserve that. Uh Jeff Haynes and I loved Pursuit Force back in the day. Good stuff. And it had a sequel. Yep. Pursu PSP, man. What a what a [\u00a0__\u00a0] unit that thing was. Yeah, PSP was a great handle. God, I love that. Not as good as Vita, but it was great handled. Well, I mean, they had Patapon. Freedom Wars. Patapon. Don't make me choose too many Pat Sacrifice. Time for this week's PSN worst name of the week. Soul sacrifice. This one comes from a guy who only signs it with his PSN name.

Now, Colin, I'm going to say stick with me on this because it's the story that makes it bad. My PSN name is a smiley_face. Now, you might hear that and say, \"That doesn't sound that bad.\" Right? I I when I read this one, I'm like, \"That isn't bad.\" Here's where we go. Some people are like, \"That name is really cool.\" But I disagree 100%. I made this name back in 2008. I'm sorry. Yeah, 2008. That's what you say sometimes. 2008 when I had just graduated high school. I was and am a part of team fat and got this nickname on foot on the football team because after a victory, I would run around the locker room in my undies making a smiley face with my belly. The nipples were the eyes. This name still haunts me, but",

Shu, please let us sh change our names. Thanks a million a smileyore. Change that one because it no one knows and it's a great story. What's so bad about that story? You're still part of team fat. You're clearly have no shame and neither do we. Yeah. So, I say embrace it, you know, like I think that's a great story. No one has any No one would ever guess that. And it's not inate innately offensive. I didn't put in the news article, but the interesting thing that's going on with the guy with the name that's going on, I didn't feel like it was like that interesting, frankly.
