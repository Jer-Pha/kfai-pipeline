The rest of them are Heather Gray. 50 shades of heather gray. It is. It's weird. There's a lot of different shades of that heather gray and I have all of them over there in another amazing shirt. The pure one Tim Gettys. This is this is what is this one called? That is neon blue. No, there was a there was a weird name for it and it was good. It was a good laugh for a while, but whatever. I like the shirt a lot. I liked how Tim looked in that shirt until Kevin Koella. Lean in here and show them. Everybody show what's up. I hate Kevin so much.

Well, we had that we had that dialogue back and forth when I had ordered two of these, one for me and you had asked for one and Kevin said he had asked for one. I was like, \"All right, well one I remember asking for one and saying does anyone want one?\" Some one person said, \"Yes, I want one.\" Kevin gave me the the little pouty eyes and he was like, \"Yeah.\" In a similar cool shirt, Color Arti Pride Long Island.

We have had seven films. Yeah, we've had seven films and we all fell in love with A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Jedi. And we haven't had anything that's dealt with that era since the 80s. So like when we got the prequels, we were dealing with droids, the droid army, the Trade Federation, all of that stuff. WTO. Exactly. And then with the Force Awakens, we've moved away from that style obviously because it's much much later.
