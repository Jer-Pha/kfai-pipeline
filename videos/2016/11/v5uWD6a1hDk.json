Um, and this is something that I've dealt with ever since. Uh, it's one of those things that you if you know unlike a lot of other phobias or other anxieties, um, you can you can moderate claustrophobia, right? And a lot of people learn to live with these things because you just figure out, okay, that's a crowded elevator. I'm just not going to go in that, right? I'll wait till, you know, depending on your how intense it is, you can wait until more people clear out of it. Um, I think you guys have probably seen me at certain points go into elevators and kind of shrink toward the door a little bit because that's sort of my safety mechanism of saying like, well, if [\u00a0__\u00a0] does go wrong, I'm the",

Um, which makes no sense, but when you're, you know, when your your brain is pumping cortisol into your, you know, bloodstream, uh, which is the, I believe it's the fight orflight, uh, hormone, you don't really think very well, right? And um so it's very weird to me that I don't know why at this point in my life at 36 I've decided to take this on. Um and I'm using jiu-jitsu as sort of the spear to to deal with this. Um because I it's something I like. I I love I love watching videos about it. I love hearing people talk about it. I love seeing it implemented in in in mixed martial arts.

I can't do this anymore.\" So I did some research, found a dude, uh, who's a cognitive behavioral therapist, and we've been working together over the last few months, um, to get me to a place that I could start progressing. And I finally have. I've actually started going out to some private lessons um and to uh a couple classes, but it's still really [\u00a0__\u00a0] hard. Um and so I just wanted to I don't know, kind of open that up as an open discussion, let you guys ask any questions you you might have about that.

Um because it has gotten a little bit better and I am able to like it was to the point where I couldn't I still probably can't ride in the middle of cars like in the back. Sure. Just can't do that. Um I still have a little bit of problems riding um in planes in the window seat. So, I usually like an aisle seat largely because I have to pee a lot, but also because if there's someone big sitting next to me, I feel trapped and I can't get out and I'll have to like remind myself that if I try to get out of this thing that's, you know, 30,000 ft in the air, it will kill everyone on the plane.

And I think I think largely the the process has been heightened uh was heightened originally by poor instruction during the first few classes that I took because a lot of people's methodology in teaching jiu-jitsu is to just throw you into the deep end, right? And by the deep end, I mean guys that are like the first guy I wrestle against, I had no idea really what I was doing was like 260 lbs and put me in a really bad spot and I freaked out. And that has been that has conditioned my brain to think that way every single time. So to put in context, imagine if every time someone shot a goal at you, you freaked out.

So it's does the claustrophobia the first experience with it? Is it your f this judo stuff or did you know about it beforehand? I'm trying to figure that out right now actually. Um it's one of the things that I is kind of an assignment for me. Um I don't think so. I think that it kind of it might go back farther than that, but I'm not quite sure. I can't pinpoint a time that I felt it that I remember feeling it other than initially, right? Um well, jiu-jitsu. I'm sorry. I apologize. That's okay.

Um but yeah, I think that was the first time like I remember um doing it for the first time with an old roommate of mine and being like this is really really fun. and then boom, just right when I hit a situation and people who aren't familiar with jiu-jitsu, there are, you know, there are more dominant positions and more and submissions where you're in a in in a worse spot. Um, it's like UFC, right? Like full So, yeah, when someone's mounted on top of you, right? Um, you're that's a really bad position for you to be in if you're if you're the person on the bottom because you really don't have a lot of control.

Um he can also punch you in the face and he can you know do [\u00a0__\u00a0] up stuff to your to your arms or he can mount you and you know submit you. There's lots of different ways to submit from both positions as I'm learning. Um but that feeling of that weird feeling of like not being in control for a second somehow lit this weird fuse in my brain that that changed the way I react to these situations. And it's very very weird to not like it's a very odd feeling to not be in control of your body like that, right? Which is something it's a reason why I haven't dealt with it for so long is that it's so hard for me to even admit to myself that I can I can walk into a place be totally fine and then for one",

Yeah. You freak out. I'm like, \"I got to get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of here.\" Like I the perfect example was like maybe like six months ago I was in a soul cycle class and I I've been to so many of these before with my wife. She has dragged me into so many of these terrible [\u00a0__\u00a0] classes where they cram you into this dark room with a dude that's sitting right here and another dude check and you're just right next to each other and then they dim the lights and it gets super hot and pulse pounding music starts happening and I was totally fine until I wasn't until I was like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] and like my wife saw me and she was like are you okay and I'm like I I mean I can't leave this class if I wanted to. There's like I would have to climb",

There's like I would have to climb over people physically so I just had to keep my [\u00a0__\u00a0] together. Um, which it turns out is basically the one of the only ways you can get used to this. And that's the the the specific like therapist that I'm seeing right now is a person who basically his his approach to it is take it little by little, but you have to do what's called exposure therapy, which is you have to start putting yourself in these situations and figuring out these tools and techniques to calm your brain as you're going through them. And it's working. And I think everyone sort of goes through this level when you're in an intense sport like this. Um, a lot of it's mental, but that's what I'm learning is, you know, for the longest time I thought there's just got to be something wrong with me. But it turns out if you're",

But it turns out if you're any sort of athlete that's trying to be get to higher levels, I think there there's a mental aspect to it that you have to overcome. Maybe it's not as bad, but I'm sure everyone has their shortcomings in that regard. So then the jiu-jitsu is where it de you notice it for the first time that you can remember. And then is it then it is like you're in an elevator and you're like this is similar to and then you're freaking out. So it started to get worse and that's why I wanted to deal with it now cuz for so long I was fine with it, right? But I think I don't know if it's an age related thing. I don't know if it's because my my old hips are giving out on me.

I'm like, \"This is really a [\u00a0__\u00a0] small subway.\" And then you get in the subway at rush hour and then it becomes a really small subway train where there's like 40 people crammed in similar to like not quite as bad as Tokyo. Nothing's quite that bad, but um similar to that. So, I don't know. It's just one of the things that that, you know, I'll probably be kind of checking back in on as we go. Um let people know. I have a goal that I want. I was telling Tim this the other day. Um, in jiu-jitsu they have um the way you progress beltwise is that they give you little stripes on each belt every time that you sort of hit a a",

How did you find a therapist? uh a lot of research. It's weird to it was a a weird roundabout way because I had to figure out what I needed first, right? Because there's a lot of different types of therapy and I also had to admit to myself that I had a problem. Sure. Um that needed someone else's guidance that I couldn't just [\u00a0__\u00a0] man up and get through. Um how long did that take? 10 years.",

It's just one of those things where when you're when you're maintaining, I mean, that's almost that's almost worse in some regard um than when you have you hit a bottom point, right? Where you're like, \"Fuck, I have to deal with this.\" When you're maintaining, it's fine because you can just sort of not put yourself in those situations if you don't want to. Good point. Yeah.

And that's my brain illogically trying to protect me and that overactive sort of control mechanism that's happening. So I would just take the stairs. Right. Planes are the hardest ones though. Of course you are the ones where we travel way too much. So I had to get over that. And I think honestly that's why it's it hasn't gone super crazy because I think having to expose myself and having to figure out techniques to get in there and calm down and relax and realize everything's going to be fine and if it's not, let go.

Well, I mean, I've shared it with you guys, but I wanted to share with the audience because I don't think it's healthy to keep this as sort of some weird secret that I have because I don't think I think that people who actually, and again, you know, for anyone out there that's suffering from worse stuff, and there's lots of worse stuff out there.

But shying away from it, I think has been was just it just doesn't work. It doesn't work eventually. So, if you're out there to answer your original question, Googled it and then looked up our health insurance and cross referenced and figured out a who do I need. I was going to go to a sports therapist, but none of them take our insurance. And then finally, I thought cognitive behavioral. I mean, a lot of people, there's a lot of different things that I could have gone to. One of which would have been like someone goes in my past and tries to figure out what started this and deal with the issue. I want Exactly. They have a couple. There's one specific one named Marty McFly that I love. Um, but this guy",

And he was like, \"Well, if you know, we can do this the long way or we can start getting you acclimated to doing this now.\" So that because at a certain point exposure you will, he was like, \"You will get it to a tipping point where it'll get better.\" Like you will get to a point where you're your body can just react to it and you'll be fine and you know, you'll be like just like everyone else. At least that's the hope. Um, but so I liked this guy's approach so I decided to go with him and I've been seeing him for a few months now and it's I think it's working.

But acknowledging that it's there or whatever, I think is a huge first step. And actually taking the step to solve it and fix it, I think is a huge, you know, a good second step. So you deserve a lot of credit. I'm sure you're touching people out there that are going to, you know, similar to the anxiety topic that I think Greg Greg did a while. I think that this will um I think I wasn't here for that topic. That wasn't unfortunate, too. But this will I would have liked to have talked to you about that. Probably would have opened up back then, too. But uh",

Yeah, I will eventually, but just because it's just because 10fold at a moment of your choosing, but yeah, like at a time and place of my choosing, but um just because you don't really know what a person's going through and like for all you know, like uh you know, there are times where I don't want to leave the house and I and I have to go somewhere and someone's kindness can really turn my day around, you know.

Yeah. And I want I want everyone out there to know like there is I know there's an aspect of stuff like this to where you face anytime you want to switch the cam Kev. Anytime. God bless Kevin. Um no it's okay. Uh, I mean I know I I recognize this in myself like there is sort of a certain taboo nature to tackling things like this in our society which is unfortunate because I feel like a lot of people don't get help because we don't talk about [\u00a0__\u00a0] like this you know and I feel like I feel",

Um, and just putting it on a micro level, I would wager to bet there are plenty of people and probably people listening to this that have quit jiu-jitsu because they couldn't deal with this and never told anyone because they didn't want to appear like [\u00a0__\u00a0] in front of their class.
