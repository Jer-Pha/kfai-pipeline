            "text": "What's up everybody? I'm Greg Miller and believe it or not, it's been nearly three years since I had a conversation with Colin. I showed you how to cook chicken wings at home in your oven and I'll tell you what, we did the video, it was fun. I was excited to show it to you but I couldn't believe the number of you that followed up on it did it. I still to this day get tweets of the photos of the wings you guys made in your oven and at your home. Super excited about them. But the problem is literally when we filmed that episode, I started to evolve the recipe because Nick said something very, you know, Nick's stupid of course, but in the episode, Nick said, you know, if you want to be crispy, why don't you just put them right on the pan? I was like, that's a great idea and I started doing that and then I changed my batter and then I changed, I changed a lot of how I did it. So I thought I would show you how to do it once again. A brand new thing here, if you haven't known, I got this",

A brand new thing here, if you haven't known, I got this kitchen island because my beautiful girlfriend Christine got it for me but more importantly, I found a passion for cooking. Something that built over 2015 and now has spilled into a full blown love affair. So everything I have here and the chicken I have over there is going to be used to make our new wings. So what I like to do first is I start with making my new batter. Now you say batter, you think I'm going to drop them into a fryer. Now here's what I always say to people, always up your butt when you talk about how much you love chicken wings or at least me and that chicken wings are bad, I'm gonna have a heart attack, da da da. Now I'm no doctor but I don't think chicken wings are that bad for you if you don't fry them. I don't fry my wings and this was one of the things, right, is",

I don't fry my wings and this was one of the things, right, is that I didn't want a fryer, I didn't want the smell, I didn't want any of these different things. So what I started doing is baking them with this recipe and then I remember Dave Tool from IGN who's a wing connoisseur like myself gave me a lot of crap about that, he said I was making crappy wings that way. And so what I did is I started mixing my batters and changing them around to get them crunchy so right now I do believe I make a wing that is crunchy and consistent like fried but not fried if that makes sense. But they are breaded which some people don't like so whatever. First off what I do, you won't need your measuring cup, it is one cup. I jump in, I get one cup of flour. Now you could get away with less flour. I don't do it because it seems like there's always that off thing where I",

I don't do it because it seems like there's always that off thing where I run out at the very end and I'm pissed off about it, you know what I mean? Then I gotta remix it, it doesn't get the right consistency and all this stuff. These are panko breadcrumbs, I like these Ian's ones, there's a million kinds. I like the breadcrumbs more than the flour for their crunchy consistency so I give it a heaping cup and I do that and I say you know what, there's not that much left and I just do that because who the hell cares? You want it to be crunchy, you want it to be delicious. Now the panko of course is probably the new addition, at least from what you remember in the old one because in the old days it was just flour which was good and it worked well but like I said the panko gives it the crunchy like so I have that mixed up there, I won't need the measuring cup",

Similar ingredients as far as spices from last time, cayenne pepper, as Colin said I believe in the conversation with Colin, seasoned to taste. I like putting a lot in there, I like that kick. Of course I'm just going to dump buffalo sauce on it anyway so it really doesn't matter. Do that, come over here with your black pepper, put it in. You're just doing this until you like the looks of it. You may want more, you may want less. Sometimes I know I've had guests over when I'll cook them, I'll make them too hot because of too much pepper, too cayenne pepper. This of course, granulated garlic here, I like to put a lot in there.

You get in there, you have some fun, you mix it up the way you want to mix it up and guess what, bam, you got chicken wings going and everybody in your house is happy. Because who isn't happy when chicken wings get made? Now, like I said, I prefer to toss mine in a buffalo sauce. Now I set my buffalo sauce up which I'll do for you here and I'll also show you a few quick ways to get around not having a sauce that says buffalo on it. But you can, what I do for Christine who doesn't like the buffalo stuff, is that I'll not sauce hers and then give her a thing of barbecue. And she'll toss barbecue on there but she'll dip them.

So that's mixed to my specifications. You got to go in there, you can see the pepper flakes on top. Maybe if I was by myself and I was looking, you know, kicking up a notch, as Emeril Lagasse would say, bam, I'd put more cayenne in there. But I'm not going to do it. I have a whole bunch of people here who might not want that. Clear these guys off because I don't need them no more. Slide them over here, your spices. I like to keep it very clean as I go. I also, this is one of the best parts about cooking. When you cook, people are impressed that you're cooking. And so you can just sit in the kitchen by yourself and get drunk. I highly recommend it. So now, I'm a garlic fiend. I don't know about you, so this is an optional step for you. But I like garlic, I like fresh pressed garlic, I like garlic and everything.",

I'm going to do three for the amount of wings I'm going to make. I'm making, by the way, I should tell you that too. We'll get to it in a second. But right now, I'm making what? Just about two pounds, a little bit less. You can scale this recipe. You can mix it as much as you want, more as you want. Again, when it's seasoned to taste, equal parts breadcrumbs, equal part flour. Scale it however you want. Put as much spice as you want. But I like using the garlic.

Not hard enough, see, it's not even smashed. You can peel the paper right off. And yes, I call it paper because God wrapped them up individually, each one of these cloves. Squeeze them off into this guy. I do this every time. You could wait. I don't. I don't like to let it build up. Do this. Now, this is going to, you might be saying, what's this wing or what's this garlic? Where is it going to play into the wings? It's going to play into the wing sauce.

Something else different that I think I did, because last time we did this, I don't believe I did full chicken wings. What I did was just the drummies. I'm a big drummy fan. But, I've come to the conclusion that I might be in the minority. Let me know in the comments below if you like drummies or the flats of wings. Because it turns out, Colin, Steimer, they both like the flats. I didn't expect that out of them. I expected better. But, that's what I get. The flats. So, you got the little drumsticks and then you got the two bones. You like the flats. He was ready to throw down on that, huh? Geez. Put that aside. That's what I call him.

I'm sure there's some scientific name for him, but I ain't no chicken doctor. Believe it or not, I don't have a chicken MD. I'm taking two eggs. Again, this is a different, you know, than what we did before. Because back in the day, I think we just tossed them in. In the original recipe we did in conversation with Colin, I took them and what did I do? I did olive oil. I put them in salt. And then I did that. But now what I'm doing is I moved this egg mixture. No problem. You don't want this company to be successful here, Steimer? Are we not on a shared egg thing in the house? I had a carton in there. Why are you busting my balls? I'm doing a cooking show over here over there. Yelling at me. Each one of those eggs at Andronicles is like 75 cents. We can afford it.

You guys are done too. Add that up in there. Not up in there. Just off to this side. So now what you see is I'm assembling of course, egg bath. I'm going to cut up the wings, dip them in this, dip them in this, put them onto my tray. Before that of course, I need to get into these wings.

But I would say early last year, maybe a year and a half ago, if I'm being generous with time, I discovered you're not supposed to cut. I didn't discover this in a bad way. Someone just told me when they saw me cutting raw chicken on a wood board, don't do that. Use a plastic one. I was like, oh, I didn't know that. It'll seep into the wood. Yeah, you don't think about it because you're going to wash it in hot water, but the wood's just so porous. Yeah, you don't do that. I didn't know that. So now look at me now. I'm cutting it on this one and I'm spreading the information, Nick, to people out there in the internet land. Now Nick, I'm going to need you again for a closeup here because this again, I've gone the full, I'll see people put up like, you know what?

They were in the two pieces, the three pieces technically, took them out like this and just breaded them that way and tossed them in the oven. Now I've seen that, but of course I like to make it like a real wing restaurant and cut them up. And so I know some people scoff at that. They don't know how to do it. And the thing you do with it is you just power through. You just go there, you get a nice angle on it, and you just go right through it. Done. And you feel like, man, look at me. I'm making the dreams happen. I know Nick's saying he's not getting a good shot of it. Because I got beer in the way, I got this. But I just started at an awkward angle. So hold on.

That'll go. We're going to do 20 minutes at 435. Take them out. Flip them. 20 minutes at 445. I probably don't have to really up it that much, but I do it because I'm crazy. So that's done over there. Come over here now. Now, I think this is still the original pizza pan I talked about in the original one.

You know, you know, obviously you could use Pam, you could use whatever, but I'll tell you right now, whatever you use, layer this shit on there. Holy cow.

I did one batch, right? Where I flipped them real quick into the egg, bring it up, rip off the excess into this. Sure. You got, you got plenty of chicken wings. Anyways, though I put them in here, right? And this, usually I've sprayed it well enough where it's not a big deal. I like to push it back on there, pack it back on there. You just pat them in and I like to get as much stuck to it as possible. Cause again, I like, I like the crunchies. I like the crunchy chicken wings. In fact, what you'll see maybe upon eating that shot around the corner. What I see upon eating is after I've tossed them in the sauce and I have a bunch of crunchies left in the bowl, I take tortillas flour, and then go in there and",

You just got to suck this up. I know my fingers, I always say are my most attractive feature. So it's hard for me to see them on the ropes like this. You know what I mean? What you got to do? I wasn't asking you Nick. I'm asking the viewer. Nick, just stop. You stop responding. You understand what I'm saying? Good job, Nick. That one was directed at you. You keep going.

And so what I had done actually on a recent try was when I was going to flip them, put them on a plate, sprayed it again, did it again, same fucking result. So I'm struggling with that part. I thought maybe for this one, what I would do is on the flip, put parchment paper down, flip them back, go that way. Well, my problem is then I feel like I'm getting back to the tinfoil where I was like, well, I like them crunchy. I like them well done. You know what I mean? I want them to crunch when you bite into them. I don't want them to lose that secondary heat. And then I was like, well, I definitely can't do it on this video.

I don't think I said that actually, but it's one I found on the internet years ago. And I've continued to evolve just like you can. That's the best thing about cooking. Like I was saying earlier, you get in there, you don't like it, you don't like an ingredient they're putting in there, put your own ingredient in there. It's great. It doesn't matter. I hate onions. I keep them out of everything. So this one thing I make, this cauliflower calls for pumpkin seeds. I use almonds. I like pumpkin seeds. It's harder to find.

So turn off your timer and then while you're here, take it up to 4.45. Again, to make them nice and crispy. Now you hear that sizzle? That's the sound of chicken wings. There you go, Nick. Get right in there. You like those, Nick? You like what you're seeing, Nick? I like what I'm seeing. So you put them down there. Be very careful. Use oven mitts.

These ones are giving me a bit more trouble already, which I'm not a huge fan of. I tore that one. Sorry, mom. Flip this guy. There you go. You're just going to flip them. Like I said, if you right now in the comments have a solution for why, or how I guess, not to make it stick, but still to make them crunchy. Because that's the one thing.

Now, if you notice what I have here is crystal buffalo sauce. Now, for a long time here in San Francisco, Colin and I had to scrounge for buffalo sauces. And what it usually meant was getting crystal or Frank's Red Hot. And that means just straight up crystal or Frank's Red Hot. There weren't any other buffalo varieties. Because the buffalo variety is brought down a few notches, because you need so much of it, the volume of it. Buffalo sauces, though, usually, they're not like that. They're not as hot as a Frank's.

God, it's good. How much do you... Don't want is good. That's like your weekly salt intake right there. No. No. It's got zero everything and then a 19% sodium. So what? I just took 20% total. So good. You're going to use another spoon, right? I'm not going to use a spoon at all. Oh, okay. Thank you. So it's not that hot. I'm going to be fine. Is anybody a burst of hot things? Hot wings? No. What I do sometimes, if I'm using just a Frank's or just a crystal, which have the extra kick to them, put them in there. And then this is where wings get unhealthy again.

I put a little bit in there off of the spoon. Not the part I tasted. Drop the garlic in, get that heated up. Because I like garlic on my wings. So what I would do is take that, toss it in there, put it over there, spin it around, get it hot, then toss as much sauce as you want. I use a lot. Spin them around, put as much sauce as you want.
