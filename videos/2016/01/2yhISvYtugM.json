Support at  http://www.patreon.com/kindafunny\n\nSubscribe to Kinda Funny! http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=gameovergreggy\n\n\nWritten by Nick Scarpino\nAnimation by Dagan Moriarty\nMusic by Tonedeff - http://www.QN5.com\n\nTroy Baker as Principal Walken http://www.twitter.com/TroyBakerVA \nAdditional voices: Kristine Steimer http://www.twitter.com/Steimer\n\nDid you watch it? Did you like it? It\u2019s pretty cool, right? Well, thing is, we want to do more of these. In fact, we want to do a whole season. Longer episodes, funnier stories, and a really ridiculous arc that Nick has already plotted. But animation doesn\u2019t come cheap, especially at that caliber. So this month, we\u2019re humbly asking our audience to help us fund an entire season of Kinda Funny: The Animated Series. To do that, we\u2019re going to use all of the money we earn on Kinda Funny's Patreon account for the month of January 2016, including the money that\u2019s already been so kindly donated so far.\n\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nColin - http://www.twitter.com/NoTaxation\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nKevin - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyKevin",
