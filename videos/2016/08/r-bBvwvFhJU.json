Howdy fellas. Is it shameful to play games on the easiest difficulty? On some games I'm just not good enough to have fun and do well on medium to higher difficulties. Next question. No, it is not. Do what you want. play the games the way you want to play them. What do you care? I mean, I think the key thing there is that am I just not good enough? It's I'm just not good enough to have fun and do well. It's like, all right, cool. Doing well is one thing. Having fun. If you're not having fun, that eventually you'll get good eventually, right? Like that's how that works. I personally I I like playing games on normal. Like I think that normal is that's the way that they intended it. It's it's usually rare, but when if I'm playing a game on normal and it's way too easy and I crank it up, I'm usually like, man, this game",

If I can't play on the default difficulty and have fun. Yeah, that that's usually usually hard and then Yeah. I mean, and all honestly and you know, in earnestness, like I think you have to play the game the way you want. It's your game once you Yeah. Once you have the game, you play it the way you want. I actually ramp the difficulty up a lot, but um that's just because I usually actually for trophies. But that's the thing is like depending on how like I think that a lot of games don't do a great job of having harder difficulties. It is just kind of like random. Yeah, exactly. they just it takes three times more bullets to kill this thing. It's like that's that doesn't make it more fun or more challenging or whatever. It's just kind of a bit more like annoying.",

Having said that, there are games like Halo that do a great job of making sure that each difficulty level is its own experience and is balanced and all that stuff. And I think that uh it's up to you to kind of find where that sweet spot is for you cuz like I I know that it could be even franchise specific. I know anytime Alfredo plays Halo, he just pops right into he does his first run on heroic because he wants to get a feel for it and then he does legendary because that's a different experience. Legendary, but for me it's normal. Name is a No Man's Sky. No man Sky. Have you guys ever played a game on easy? Oh, sure. Probably. Yeah. Yeah.

My the first game that I can remember was Devil May Cry 1 because it that game had a feature where if you died I think five times uh in the early on then it just automatically bumps you down to easy.

Uh Yousef McGweed says, \"With the success of Pok\u00e9mon Go and Battlefront, how important do you think IP is to a video game?\" Oh, huge. Extremely important. Hugely important. Having something that's identifiable is like the most important thing for marketing and marketing is how things get sold. So, um, in terms of success of a game, I think that it's easier for people to wrap their heads around what something is when they can visualize it already. You know, when it's a new IP, it's like, what does that even mean to people? They need to then learn what that is. Whereas Battlefront, you can literally have a teaser trailer",

Whereas, uh, other things need to show a lot more for you to take something out of It's the reason games with the two after them sell better, right? Because there's usually now an established audience who's already learned what this is and has talked about it and going out and they want you to go do that. And that's why, you know, obviously Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 is going to sell so much better than Sunset Overdrive. Yeah. Yeah. I I uh I don't know. I don't know that I have anything really to add to it.

They probably could still sell millions of copies of that game every year if they wanted to. Well, Grand Theft Auto is a great actually the best example of all of them, right? So, you know, they if I would if I would not I don't know that I would have the rel the uh the restraint that Rockstar and Take 2 have had with that game where if I had Grand Theft Auto 5 and I was like, \"Well, now we're just going to hire literally five studios and we're just going to make Grand Theft Auto all day. Every year Grand Theft Auto is going to come out.\" That's what they did on PS2.

So I think that there's ways to really respectfully treat the IP as well and keep in mind too that going back to the well on an IP doesn't necessarily mean that you don't get to make new ones.

Joy Bonoodles. A follow-up question to the last one. Human Sky, what do you think about that potential Telltale Mr. Robot robot game? I don't know what to make of this yet. I think by the time, well, maybe not by the time this actually airs, but around that time, we'll probably have information on it. I find it hard to believe that Telltale is gonna make a Mr. Robot series, but they did make a what was that Wolf Among Us, which is arguably not nearly as popular as Mr. Robot.

If they make a Mr. Robot series, that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] bold and badass, especially cuz Mr. Robots apparently is ratings are not very good this season. So, but I'm a little I'm a little reluctant to think that they're making it.

Batman in Marvel in Game of Thrones and I had another Minecraft. They're they're working with huge and then Mr. Robot. I'm like well it just doesn't seem like I mean I would love that.

My favorite of all time is Gold and Silver and the remakes on the DS, Heart Gold and Soul Silver are I think by far the best Pokemon games. The uh they're all good. They're all great even. So, it's like I don't think that uh there's any bad place to jump in. Black and White was really good. Um if you're only going to do one, I'd go hard gold and Soul Silver and go from there.

They're doing Leighton. Um you know, so so they seem to have their hands full. I don't know like like the rhyme or reason to how they make how how they make their games, but I think Dark Cloud 3 has always been kind of a point of discussion.
