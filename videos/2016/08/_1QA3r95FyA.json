We're recording episode 49 in kind of funny studios before you record episode 48 while Tim and I are in Austin, right? And uh that's why this is a more uh evergreen episode as we would like to call it. That's a great point. But I want to say and and this might be shown out of order when we introduce everything, whatever. This is the I think the very first This is the first thing we've ever filmed in studio and filmed in. So, a round of applause for Kevin and Nick, all their work.

We know how much people like lists and stuff. So, it's a we won't have the news of the day. We won't have the normal thing there. We do have some reader mail in terms of what people voted for for theirs. We got a song, we had all that stuff. But if this is your first episode of PS I Love You XOXO, it's a much different show when you see it as going.

That was a concern of mine was that this is a bad week to have to do this, but that's just the nature of the setup and and we are prepared uh if if I do feel like things are going to start leaking. You think cuz you figure this is going live. This is our, you know, in terms of PS I love you XOXO shows. This is the one that goes live the 23rd. So there's still a full week for someone to [\u00a0__\u00a0] up and put out a whole or two weeks I guess. It's not the end of the world. It is what it is. We have to do this eventually, right? Because you have to leave. So, you know, to go you're going to be gone for a week. So, it all makes sense and it's all fine. Yeah, I think it's fine and dandy. Yeah.

We will be though uh 100 p.m. Sunday, September 4th is the kind of funny panel.

We always had to go into these rooms and hash out the top 10 or top 25 lists, all these things. Just terrible. And then people would come in and, you know, they would be all like, \"Well, I want to do this.\" and they'd all what about this and you don't have this and we always like get the hell out of here. This is our job to make the list. If you wanted to do it, why why' I just waste my afternoon this? Then we'd all get in a big fight and we'd all break off and we'd kind of just do whatever the [\u00a0__\u00a0] we wanted, right?

We're going to do it in a in a way that I think makes sense that's I think balanced and fair. Fair and balanced. The way we're going to do it is we're going to present each of our top 10 lists and then we're going to mathematically combine them to make the definitive top 10 list. The way we'll do that is the number one game will get 10 points, the number two game will get nine points, the number 10 game will get one point and then we'll just add the math together. The top 10 sums will right will then be made into the actual list. So, I think it'll be interesting how it all shakes out. Of course, uh now of course the rules we need to go over and I guess the guidelines. The rules and guidelines.

But we're not doing this thing where we're trying to build out a list that's super objective. This is Colin and Greg's list. There's no literally nothing. There's never been anything objective about a top 25 list. I always hated that approach. And yeah, so there's not going to be you're not going to see Street Fighter 5, although I don't think would be on there. You're not going to see a fighting game. You're not going to see a racing game. You're not going to see so no drive club, no whatever Need for Speed, The Crew, whatever the hell you play. And then uh just to have them. Yeah.

So, take that with a grain of salt if you'd like. Uh, but this is a a honest or an honest presentation of our feelings on on the PlayStation 4 library so far. And what I figured out, we can talk about it when we kind of co collaborate and and and put this list together, is this list, my list, and I'm sure your list too, I was saying we were talking before for three years in pretty strong, pretty strong list. Oh, sure. Yeah. Uh, the other thing I want to cover is this something we came to. These are native to PlayStation 4 games or games that released on PlayStation 4 as well as the platforms at the same time, right? So, so the example there is Rzzog Gun is an example of a game that would be on the list because it came to PS4 and then it came to PS3 and VA later. So, it is on those platforms.

Uh, but something like Dead Nation is not a PS4 game. It's a PS3 game that was ported to PS4. DC Universe Online, Last of Us. Exactly. So, uh, that's important, too. And the other thing I want to say about my list, and I don't know if your list is the same way, I've there are game there are a few games in particular that I might have included on this list that are on PS4 that came concurrent to PS4, but I played them on VA. Exactly. So, I can't really speak to the PS4 experience. Uh so, uh I wrote down six games in particular that I think I would that would be in consideration in some respect for this list that are not on the list because I played them on PS4 and not or Vita rather. I'm not saying that they would necessarily be on the list, but they would have been they would be on the list. You'd be having a",

I'm not saying that they would necessarily be on the list, but they would have been they would be on the list. You'd be having a conversation narrow down. So, those games are like Rogue Legacy. Ro Legacy is amazing. I played on Vita, too. It's a Vita game to me. I'm sure when we do our Vita list, when we do this Vita show one day, that'll be on there. Yeah, Wo Dave is a game that I really love. It's a it's a Mario Bros. original, not Super Mario Bros. but Mario Bros. kind of clone. I love that game. Three4ths Home definitely would have been on my list, but uh that's I played that on Vita. A blah probably not, but a game that I would have considered. Same thing with Foul Play. Uh played on Vita and Downwell. So, those games I want to throw out there is like, well, why why aren't those on the list or they they were not even under consideration because of the rule set. That makes sense. That makes sense. When we do Vita",

That makes sense. When we do Vita again. Yeah. And that will go the other way around where um you know if you played something I I don't even know PS4 games that you didn't play on VA. That's not very common for us. But no, not at all. If something's on the VA, I save it for the VA cuz I got to play something like goddamn Vita. What up, Gal Gun? Uh and the final thing I want to point out, not that I think it would have made our lists, but seeing as how this is kind of a snapshot time capsule. People will be coming back to this video hopefully if SEO works. Uh I want you to understand No Man's Sky just came out for us. I have not put enough time into it to know if I think it's one of the greatest PlayStation 4 games of all time. So, it's not in consideration here.

And, uh, I want to say the same, although maybe not as important to a lot of people. The Hyper Light Drifter as well, also Bound. Uh, so we have access to these games. Hyper Drifter is out by the time we're recording this. Bound isn't out, but we have it. Um, two other games that you might that might have made the list. I'm sure we'll update in the future. So, of course. Yeah. No, this is 2016 edition. When I have Cyborg Colin and hologram Kevin, we'll update the list.

I know The Witness is amazing. I played the witness for an hour and a half or whatever, not being a puzzle guy. Had fun running around doing a few of them, but you know, it's it didn't hold my it didn't hold me. It wasn't what I wanted. This surprises me because this seems more like what we were saying that you're you seem to be pigeonholding. But when we get in here, you're No, no, no. When we get into the list, my number three choice is a game that I haven't sunk hundreds of hours into, but played enough to respect, understand, and know that in another life I would have been super into this.

I and I I want to talk about the craftsmanship of The Witness. I want to talk about the beauty of The Witness, the puzzle design of The Witness. I can sit here and objectively tell you that all that's amazing. And I think while it doesn't make get a spot on my favorite games because it's not one of my favorite games, I think it does deserve, you know, a conversation, a tip of the hat, as they say. A wink of the eye, rub of the balls. We haven't done We haven't done We haven't done a pregnant pause in a long time. What's your first honorable mention? Uh, Rocket League. Um, so, uh, the real, so Rocket League is actually a really immaculate and impeccable game. Yeah. The reason that I don't want to put it on my list is because I think it's a little disingenuous. Now, I called Rocket League being great, obviously, for a long way",

But, and I also dedicated, you know, about a week's worth of time into it before anyone had it, playing it, getting most of the trophies, really enjoying playing against the AI, playing against some people online when no one knew what they were doing. But the spirit of the game is it's multiplayer. competitive multiplayer in which I do not partake in at all because everyone's so good. So, um, while I respect The Shadow of Rocket League, uh, I think it's a great game. I think it's a really fundamentally interesting game. I think it's a different kind of game. Um, I don't necessarily want to put on the top 10, but I do think it is a fantastic mustplay game on PlayStation 4. I just don't think it belongs on my list when I kind of",

Uh, so Rocket League is my first honorable mention. Okay. My next honorable mention is Fallout 4. Uh I think I have a bad taste in my Fallout in my Fallout mouth right now. In Fallout in my mouth about Fallout 4 right now because of the DLC because the DLC came late. I jumped in. It no longer mattered, right? Like well I don't even remember remember what I was doing and who am I working with and I I got the platinum. So I have all these different saves and digging around and getting back and I was like it didn't even run that well, right?

I played that game non-stop. I don't think it gets a spot in my top 10. I think the other 10 games I have here are better experiences or offered something different or gave me better memories. But Fallout 4 scratched an itch last year that I can't for forget or, you know, now sit here and armchair quarterback what I feel about it after the fact and compare DLC to it. Yeah, I think to me I I only played Fallout 4 for 25 hours or so and I only I mean that's a lot of time but bless you uh for 20 25 hours or so.

I think we'll see how people kind of go to Skyrim when it comes back out on PS4 and Xbox One, but um which is soon in the coming months. Uh, but what surprises me is that there's just doesn't seem to be a lot of buzz about Fallout 4. Now, I I know it sold really well. I know millions of people played it. I'm not saying that it's not a good game or a great game. I People aren't we no one It's not Fallout 3.

Um my second honorable mention goes to Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, which was a basically a full game in and of itself, but it's it's it's a standalone DLC pack for Wolfenstein: The New Order. Um, and I really really loved what Machine Games did with this and uh really gave me hope before E3 when it was basically confirmed in an Easter egg that they're going to make a new one called the new looks like it's going to be called the new Colossus.

I didn't do all of them cuz some of them really hard, but you go back to certain maps and basically are racking up scores by uh killing people in certain ways and kind of doing things quickly and doing things completely. Um, so I really thought it was a it was a fantastic little piece of DLC. Affordable. People always ask me, should I get the new order? I get the old blood. And I say, you got both.

Adored Valiant Hearts. I think when we talked about this like we're going to do this top 10 thing, I thought it would have gotten into my top 10 no problem. But I got there and put down all these PlayStation 4 games. And for some reason, it didn't crack into that. I feel like it was probably number 11. It's the one that's right outside. And I have a million reasons for why my top 10 is my top 10. But I can't sit here and not talk about Valiant Hearts, how great that story was, how interesting it was. The gameplay was.

It was a very cool game. Um, it's funny because Valiant Hearts was on my short list as well and uh didn't make my honorable mentions, but was probably in the last 15 along with Child of Light, which was another UB Ubisoft kind of art game. Um, I'm a little confused where these games have gone. I mean, the Child of Light and Valiant Hearts came out months apart and and and this is kind of within the same framework, I would say, as um Rayman. Uh, maybe not as high budget or as as well appreciated. Um, but I do think I agree with you. I think Valiant Hearts deserves an deserves a shout out and it's not really another mustplay game.

Exactly. Yeah. Stories and what's yours? My final honorable mention goes to Doom. Ah, you love Doom. I didn't beat Doom. I'm I'm about I don't know, I want to say 80% through it.

And the reason I I alluded to when I was talking about the old blood, this single playercentric thing that Bethesda as a publisher has been doing, Doom obviously comes from id new look ID. this game Doom Doom 4 really um was in trouble and and it seems like it was remade on new ITTE and um there were very little expectations.

I just don't know if they didn't realize it or if it didn't mock review well or if they really just wanted to wait for the updates in the online component which is not important to the game at all. I don't think gives a flying [\u00a0__\u00a0] about it frankly. Um what I was really surprised about with Doom is Doom always told a story kind of a cursory way about Demons on Mars is a very silly kind of shitty kind of you know sci-fi thriller kind of thing.

I'm like there's an incredibly deep story actually in this new Doom. It's not necessarily an important or integral story to appreciating the Twitch gunplay that the fast fluid 60 frames that they have going on in this game, but it's really really really really surprisingly deep. If you go get all the cotices, if you read about the monsters and the weapons it's surprising like they've almost tried to ground Doom in a way and you know Doom I think from Doom 1 to two to three has gotten I guess more grounded if you want to call it that. It's never been grounded. There's nothing grounded about fighting demons on Mars but um and and in hell as well. Uh, but it's I liked that narrative edge to it.

So, um, yeah. So, shout out to Doom and shout out to Bethesda. I mean, but Bethesda appeared three times in the honorable mentions. And and I'm confident in my own selections and your selections that I don't think any of these games appeared in each other's lists. So, right. Rocket League is not on your list, I assume.

It's another zombie game which is unfortunate for a lot of people. I mean, it's the way we talk about Days Gone where it's like, oh, but it's just it looks like The Last of Us and and that game can really suffer. But I think Dying Light still made it into that window in early 2015 where I was like, well, you could still kind of get away with the zombie [\u00a0__\u00a0] without it being a little trit. Well, what's interesting is you've been against the zombie thing for so long.

Um, and it's just that things are being done differently or the gameplay mechanics or the story or some sort of uh ancillary quality of the game drags you in. And I think with Dying Light, I just like the I like the crafting. I like the dayight cycle. I think it's really cool. Like you don't go outside during that night. It's really dangerous. It it you know, games like that really started with me with like Castlevania 2 Simon's Quest on NES where there's a dayight cycle and at night it's a little more scary. It gets darker. The enemies take twice as much damage. You're dealing with some new features, whatever. In in Dying Light, the game is brutal.

You see them on your like HUD tracking you and you're like hiding and staying still. There's a there's a horror quality to the game that I think is underappreciated. And I really do think, as I've said before, that Techland um outdid themselves. That game sold many millions of copies. So, I'm not the only one out there that enjoyed it.

And when we talk about games, that's what it is. And it was a throwback. It was a return to form. It was it was Ratchet again. Whereas there had been so many spin-offs and weird things. And then people had wanted to get back to a Kraken Time. And maybe Kraken Time did too much. It did too much with the characters. Too many different things that weren't what people wanted from Ratchet necessarily. Uh this was classic Ratchet and it was what I wanted at that time. It's literally classic Ratchet, right?

It's just not something that's necessarily common to these kinds of games where your character is all about the weapon he finds, not about the character you're building.

So this reminds me a lot about what like endless mode and all those kinds of things did in Mega Man 10, but where they basically were able to hack the hack the games in such a way to patch them together in any way they wanted. And so when they were like Colin, you want to make a test. I was like, \"Yes.\" I'm like, \"What are the rules?\" And they're like, \"You can do whatever you want.\" So there are no rules. So like find this is the way I did it for if you guys want a behind closed behind you. Come behind the curtain. Come behind the curtain.

It's not Oh, it's not a re-release because it's a compilation and a collection with new additions, plus all the art, all the music, the soundtracks, and all that kind of stuff. I think this game is detached enough from that particular rule where these are NES games that have been on lots of different things, but never put together in this particular fashion.

Oh, and this is my first time posting. I was a hardcore Xbox fanboy for many years, but decided to get both current gen consoles so I could play with my friends. My",

I was a hardcore Xbox fanboy for many years, but decided to get both current gen consoles so I could play with my friends. My gamer tag on Xbox forever has been and forever will be the generic Drop Shot 42. But I decided that my PSN name should be funny and memorable. Oh, how I regret that. My PSN name is Sausage Bandit 69. That's Sausage Bandit 69. As you can see, this name is ridiculous and unoriginal on its own.

It's s a u ss a g. Jesus bandit 69. Ever since I can't look at my name without pronouncing the word in my head as Sasarge in a pol in a posh sounding voice.

Hey Colin and Greg, my name is Jack and I'm the vocalist and guitarist for the band Jar of Adams. We are a two-piece band based in Nottingham, UK. Oi. I'm not sure what our genre is, but I guess I'd say it's kind of bluesy rocky. I've been following you guys since beyond days beyond and I'm elated that you have been able to find the success you have. I submit to you our first song Nymphomaniac which we have released for free in an attempt to promote our band. It's available on to download on Soundcloud and Bandamp. You can find us on Twitter and Instagram atjarofadams and it's atoms of course and Facebook at facebook.com/jarofadams. Unfortunately, we haven't recorded a video for it yet. So, I put the music over a video of JeanClaude Vanam dancing on YouTube. He did and it's awesome. I hope you guys enjoy it. Best of luck in the future as you continue to grow towards superstardom.

Thank you ladies and gentlemen for watching the first ever video product from the Kind of funny studios. Kevin, how did you do on the camera switching? Was it jarring? No, you gave a thumbs up. Let me know in the comments if it was jarring. Well, I'm sure I'm going have to slow as roll. Is he flipping around a lot right now? Ladies and gentlemen, this is Jack from Jar of Adams, right? No. Yeah. Jack from Jar of Adams with the song Nyommaniac. Until next time, it's been our pleasure to serve you. [Music]",
