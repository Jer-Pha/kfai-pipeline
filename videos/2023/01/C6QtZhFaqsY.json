I want to say um and so I'll put that up there in terms of the game I'll put a lot more time in yeah firm software whenever from software puts out their next game whether it's armored Core or whatever comes after that I could see myself putting another 100 hours into that Gina do you have any qualms about 100 hour games yeah I I think it's for me it's always a little bit intimidating when a game is I think a notably long Triple A expert because usually there's triple games I don't really know",
