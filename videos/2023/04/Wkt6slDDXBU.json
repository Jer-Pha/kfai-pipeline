            "text": "hey what up Gamers it's Andy from kinda funny EA sent us some early review codes for Star Wars Jedi Survivor We all played it we all reviewed it go check out our thoughts on our Channel now if you know me you know I love a good comparison video so I thought I'd show off how Cal shipped the Mantis looks in Jedi Survivor Now versus how it looked in Jedi Fallen order now it seems like pretty much every object in the world has been altered or upgraded in some way lots of micro details and blemishes really add to that lived in feel but more noticeably the lighting is kind of the star of the show here improvements to shadows and ambient inclusion make a lot more of the objects feel more grounded in this world what do you think though does the mantis look a lot nicer or is it just brighter or maybe just answer the more important question what color of lightsaber you're going to go with let me know in the comments down below [Music] thank you",
