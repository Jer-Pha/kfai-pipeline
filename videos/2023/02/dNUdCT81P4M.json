I think it is an amazing game came out of nowhere is this very colorful cell-shaded Saturday morning cartoon style Rhythm action games and it's very it's very character action at the end of each combat encounter you're getting a score at the end that it can go all the way up to an S rank for me the places in which Hi-Fi Rush separates itself are the places where it decides to be unique I think for me that starts off with the art style and with the art Direction being the Saturday morning cartoon thing that doesn't just go for Saturday morning cartoons right there are so many different Inspirations I can point to for where Hi-Fi Rush shot so many of its different elements there are some elements of spider-verse in terms of like the character animation the framing the comic book style of it there are some Persona uh Inspirations that I can find in here there's so much that goes into this game from just a presentation and",
