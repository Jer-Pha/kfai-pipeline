Mr snow bike Mike yeah very well said they're blessed it is a four out of five on the kind of funny scale for me this is a great showcase and Jeff and his team got in their Duffy and I was really impressed I think having the live audience really changed it up for Jeff right I think we're coming off of two years now with him creating something that is not live not in front of an audience and really I think it changed up his formula and how he had to do this you can see him smiling up on stage getting the crowd to interact and be a part of that is a big deal bringing up celebrities I think we did hit the snooze button halfway through into the third the three-fourths part about this and like that's the only downfall that I can really critique the games he had were solid there are",
