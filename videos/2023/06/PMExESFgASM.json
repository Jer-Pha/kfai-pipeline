I think maybe the whole time um he doesn't walk around with his wedding ring you know most men if they take off their wedding rings because they want to do bad things but here it was like his version of a superhero mask he he does this he wears this costume or the lack thereof to protect those he loves because if he wears this wedding ring it's a signal to all of his enemies that there is a wife somewhere out there that they can use against him by hurting her I mean that is totally even backed up with the conversation about the tell me something I don't know where he was just",
