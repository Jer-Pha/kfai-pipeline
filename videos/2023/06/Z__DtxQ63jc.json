            "text": "this is I think the best Final Fantasy game ever made I think this is one of the best video games ever made time will tell where this falls on my list of favorite final fantasies and I think that that's crazy but when it comes to what makes a final fantasy I think this game reinvents all of that for a modern audience a more mainstream audience while also showing so much love to the people that have been there from the beginning the people that have been there for the last couple iterations whatever their entry point into Final Fantasy I think Final Fantasy 16 is the God of War 2018 moment for this franchise from a narrative point of view from a combat point of view just pure Vision standpoint the production values of this game everything works together so beautifully and the game only gets better the more you play it this is pushing the franchise forward in such a major way and they did it oh yeah did it",
