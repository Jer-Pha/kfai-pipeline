I was very excited for it because what last December well quite a few months ago Mike and Joey did their preview on it on the show and they talked about it and I was like oh this sounds like a really fun game and then I went and I read Ryan McCaffrey's preview that pop that same day and I was like dude he's making this sound like a game of the year Contender I'm putting this on my radar I really want to check out Diablo 4. let alone the things I've heard about Diablo",
