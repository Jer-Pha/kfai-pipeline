            "text": "you should get arrested in Starfield one of the best side quests in Starfield is hidden to only those who break the law go to a UC faction system and commit a crime I stole some stuff from a dude's desk on new Atlantis and before I knew it a guard was giving me a lecture but this was different instead of like Skyrim he didn't give me an option to pay a fight or even go to jail he wanted me to see his boss after making the very difficult decision to go away peacefully the head of UC security gave me a choice go to jail or infiltrate the space pirates known as the Crimson Fleet also known as the guys you fight in the beginning of the game this kicks off a multi-planet side quest where you have to tow the line between being an agent of UC and a crimson fleet member and it's easily one of the best side quests the game has to offer so that's why",
