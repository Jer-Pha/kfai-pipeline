I wish they had put eight more minutes into this movie to explain what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] was going on the entire time because they glossed through so many things that I had to rewind it multiple times to be like wait what whose lawyer is this who's what is Jill why is Jill has a lawyer what's going on in this movie well they tripled the amount of characters and it's too many characters Hoffman and strong",
