God of War Ragnarok which is at 94 and Hades which is at 93 uh puts it right above all those which is pretty incredible um what's also incredible is that the game's running super well I got an article here from Olivier McKenzie at Eurogamer who says Baldur's Gate 3 on PS5 is effectively the PC version at ultra settings from a visual perspective the PS5 version mostly equips itself quite well in terms of basic graphical features it",
