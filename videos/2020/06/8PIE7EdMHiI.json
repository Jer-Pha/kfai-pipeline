Krabs the original voice actor for mr. Krabs did not return for this game and I actually don't remember if it was the actual voice actor for mr. Krabs in the original game it's been too long the robot this robot is called a monsoon watch out for his lightning attack oh we better watch out but he's floating around and stuff but we can just take him out with our good ol jump attack there and so we're breaking some tikis right now tikis are essentially like a like a box it or crates in crash of bandicoot you got some like basic wooden ones",
