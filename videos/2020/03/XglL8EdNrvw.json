D's example of Pokemon go Pokemon go was horrifying if you had a MS if you had multiple sclerosis if you had muscular dystrophy absolutely walked you out of the game if you had to stay inside your house where you couldn't go outside horrifying because you know there's no way that you could go the pokey stops for those people it was bad for one-handed gamers it was amazing it was the best book in my game that had come out so far and the idea is you have to push the companies to be inclusive to everybody while not alienating the people that have already had accessibility open for them so there's a little bit",
