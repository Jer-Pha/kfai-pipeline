Now we know that Xbox has their Smart Delivery system, and this is where I get into my two questions, but could this be the first sign that Sony has a similar idea up their sleeve? Finally, with the idea of upgrading games for free for new consoles, do you believe that the idea of new console generations having weak line-ups will be a thing of the past now that we will have our entire previous generation's library running better on the current system moving forward? - Best Friends Q:The Nano Biologist\n00:28:45 - Cyberpunk lets you customize your genitals - Joe Skrebels @ IGN\n00:36:48 - Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath is the game\u2019s year two expansion- Alessandro Fillari @ Gamespot\n00:42:52 - Today we got the reveal trailer for Mortal Kombat Aftermath.
