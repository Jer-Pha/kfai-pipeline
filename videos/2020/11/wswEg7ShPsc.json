Uh, including this episode of PS I Love You XOXO. Of course, ladies and gentlemen, usually we come to you every Tuesday morning. However, this week we held off till Friday because of, drum roll please, a million PlayStation 5 embargos. Of course, you clicked on this one, whether it be on your uh podcast feed or your YouTube feed. You know, this one is called the PlayStation 5 review. However, on kind of funny.com/ps5, we have a multitude of videos and podcast for you. We have Spider-Man Miles Morales review. We have Astro's Playroom review. We have Greg Miller's walkthrough of the PlayStation 5. We have Can PT play on the PlayStation 5. These are all up again uh kind offunny.com/ps5. And then spread across",

We've had the PlayStation 5 for a week now. More than a week, right? Yeah. Because the first embargo was last week, right? Is that right? Does that check out? Yeah. No, that checks out. No, time is a is a flat circle, especially uh this year where like totally everything's just weird. Yeah, like this thing. I've seen these same four walls for what feels like the last three months.

So, it's still a world of redacted reviews and embargos and things like that. But to finally be able to not worry about saying something incorrect, uh embargoed about the PlayStation 5, I feels like is huge weight off our shoulders today as we hit this Friday embargo and there's all these other videos up. Exactly. And that and that's kind of where I'm at where like you know I've been playing a lot of Miles Morales and a lot of Astros Playroom.

It is in a lot of ways an iteration on what the PS4 is. Like it is making improvements in all the places where you'd want improvements. You know, you look at the UI and the UI is snappy and quicker and sleeker in all the ways that you'd want it to be. Uh the SSD, you know, makes for game makes for faster loading and all all the features that you'd expect out of that. All the things that we've been told over the course of I guess the last two years, like all that stuff is accurate.

Like I I to the to to the extent that I understand why they give it a different name and I've talked about it in our multiple uh uh Astrobot content, Astros play room content, right?

I think that's I think that's the thing I did. I conflated those two, but yeah, Digital Extremes, they put out their blog post uh yesterday or I guess two days ago. No, yesterday as the time you're listening to this uh where they talk about how Warframe is getting a PS5 update, and they they site uh 4K resolution at 60 fps, significantly shorter load times, 11 seconds instead of 42 uh 42 seconds for like a load.

And those last two points are the ones that I kind of want to point out because I talked about this a little bit on Games Daily yesterday, but I I first for so many of the stories that been coming out on PS5, I've not really felt like I've been able to elaborate as much as I can because of embargos and whatnot.

The the idea that they're citing uh down the road haptic feedback to make different planetary biomes feel unique. That's something that I'm really excited about. Even though I think on the surface it it comes off as gimmicky and comes off as all right, how exciting is this going to be years down the line, at least for right now, I look at that and I'm like, that sounds really awesome because just from the games I've played using the the uh adaptive triggers and using the haptic feedback, that stuff really comes through.

Um stuff like that I'm really excited about and stuff like that has me really um happy with where the PS5 is at and where it's going to go in the future. Yeah, the Dual Sense, and I know we're going to talk about the console for an hour or two here, so don't worry about it. But Dual Sense, to piggyback off what you're saying, I think especially coming off of Astro and of course Spider-Man, which we're playing, but let's talk about Astro, how upfront it is, and as we talked in our review about Astro, right, of the raindrops on it, the falling into the clay and, you know, picking up your muddy feet and how that feels.

Today, I was doing some last second capture of Spider-Man Miles Morales, and I was doing it at my setup here. So, I actually had the game muted and was just doing what I needed to on the controller. And having far fewer distractions all of a sudden really made it like what you're talking about feel when it would rumble just in my right hand or just in my left hand as I web swung around or I fought somebody like that.

I'm going to be fascinated when I do switch off of playing something on PS5 and play it on Xbox or for some reason have to go back and play something on PlayStation 4 and feel the differences there. And that leads me to a question that was submitted at patreon.com/kindfunny games from AJ. Hi, Greg and Bless. I've read all the reviews and watched all the videos about the Dual Sense and I'm really excited to try it out. Now that you've gotten the chance to use the Dual Sense with thirdparty games, do you guys still think the haptic feedback and adapt adaptive triggers are still game changers the press has been gushing about? What's important, of course, AJ, is that we are not allowed to talk about any third party",

What's important, of course, AJ, is that we are not allowed to talk about any third party games whether we've played them or not or are currently in the middle of their campaigns or anything like that. What I can tell you is that I think it's interesting to see what you're talking about, Bless, and what you just brought up, right? To see Digital Extreme say they are going to put this stuff in there. That is a huge boon to see show that yes, people are going to support this. I would imagine, yeah, your big budget AAA, it's across everything. You know, your Ubisoft games, your EA games. I don't know how much they're going to tinker with it, but something that is more dialed into a fan base and an audience and can maybe see that, oh, well, we have such a PlayStation audience there. Of course, we should do more with it. I know No Man's Sky has come out and said something similar,",

Um, I will be fascinated to see because when it's when it's done the way it's done with Sony first party, it is a different ball of wax. Yes. And I I think third party developers will will use it enough. Like I don't think every third party developer is going to use it obviously because porting stuff takes work and like the more you can cut down on that, the easier it is probably to port your game. Sure. But I think when you that that was one of my main fears when it came to the ways in which the Dual Sense and a lot of the a lot of uh PS5 features in general are just different from every other platform. Like if I'm putting out a game on uh Xbox, PC, and Switch, then why would I why would I uh add game help in there? Why would I add",

Why would I add specific Dual Sense functionality in there when that's just going to add way more work just to make this makes this thing work on this one platform? That said, I feel like the stuff Dual Sense at least, I think the features that are available on the Dual Sense are so enticing that developers might really want to try that stuff out. Like especially in in the case of Miles Morales when you're swinging, uh there's a certain tension at the end of the press for the for the right trigger that you feel that you kind of have to push in through to actually swing all the way. That's not something that like you have to like program from scene to scene, right? Like that is a that is a thing you set just for swinging and like it's like that the whole",

I could I can see plenty of scenarios where devs are devs are like, \"Oh, cool. Okay, we can do this trigger stuff. Let's just set it so that when you're using your the I know the bow and arrow is the go-to example, but when you're using the bow and arrow weapon, classic example for the dual set, like when you're whenever you're using your bow and arrow weapon, you have you have that tension and like that's not something that's something that you can I'm not going to try and like guess how long it takes to implement that, but that's something we let's just say that's something you can implement and you know just have have that go and not not be not have",

Like hold your controller still so you don't get eaten up by whatever the monster is. I I think you'll see please show some respect. I didn't want to spoil the game, Greg. And so there you go. You just spoiled it. Hold on. Um, but yeah, like I think you'll see more subtle ways and more natural ways that people implement that stuff.

Um, I think the Dual Sense is going to make people going to going to make certain devs get really creative with it, but at the very least allow for whatever dev to be like, \"All right, yeah, let's just add this specific thing just for just for this uh this mechanic.\" You figure if it goes the same way it went uh with something like Final Fantasy 7 remake, right?

But again, if PlayStation finds a modicum of success like they have found with the PlayStation 4 and they keep making those deals, I think you'll keep seeing people say, \"Okay, cool. How can we make our game better on PlayStation?

Just like you, Canon says, \"How is the Dual Sense battery life compared to the DualShock 4? Even with the revised controller that came with the PS4 Pro, I barely got a day out of it. How fast is the charging? Will I get more than a few hours use if I plug it in while I let my dogs outside for 15 to 20 minutes? Does the charging dock charge as fast the USBC port in the front?

It is fast. It it syncs trophies quickly. Uh it counts my game clock now on all my games and show how long I've been going. Like, you know, for me, it's always like, you know, when you used to go on a PlayStation 4 and compare trophies to a friend, right? I don't know if you ever did that because not many people do, but it is such an arduous task of trying to get that to load up, especially when you're us and we have a gajillion games for it to compare.

But from somebody coming from a PlayStation 4 Pro that could sound like a goddamn jet engine playing Avengers, to have a console that is just whisper quiet and actually when I move through the menus moves as quickly as I want it to move is perfect. And that's what I'm looking for. Uh, it's funny you brought up the N64 earlier because when it when when whenever the uh, you know, this is how fast the the games load in like conversation starts, I always think of, well, I had a N64 back when I was a kid and there was no loading on that",

And that's this is something we brought up on the Spider-Man Miles Morales review, but I wanted to bring it in here to Shane had written patreon.com/confunname and said, \"Gressing, could you find Jets, please lay out the loading time comparisons?

Uh, what I had said on the Spider-Man review and we'll echo here is that there's no need to do that because the PlayStation 5 loading is so ridiculously fast. For Miles Morales, it is 18 seconds from your game selection, whatever you want to call it. From where you hit the play button, the game is completely off and you hit play. It is 18 seconds to going through picking your save like you're talking about blessing and then being in New York.

Yeah and obviously that is exactly what I want out of the nextG systems and what I want out of the PlayStation 5 and as I want to it. I think it does lead personally for me to the first big con of the PlayStation 5 and this is compared strictly to the Xbox Series X and it's the fact that there is no quick resume on PlayStation 5. There is on Xbox Series X. You can have multiple games open, you can open another one, then come back to where you left off and go.

And even like one of to drive home this point, right, for me is like right now on PlayStation 5 and I I play other games, I swear, but for the arguments that I'm using today, uh Avengers, right? Avengers from hitting play on PlayStation 5 to actually playing the game is a minute 35, which if you've ever played Avengers, ladies and gentlemen, is great.

So, for this argument of what I'm making of like, sure, 30 seconds, who cares? But to be considered in this quick resume conversation, it's like, well, it was, you know, I was playing a different game, Redacted, last night, and Jen wanted me to go check something in uh Bug Snacks, which I'm playing, I guess I can say now, where it's like, and I'm like, oh, sure.

Yes. So, I have an article here from Eurogamer, right? Demon Souls on PS5 has over 180 game help videos. Uh, and like that for me is might be the thing that actually gets me into Demon Souls cuz like playing playing Bloodborne, I know everybody like everybody tells me, \"Hey, Bless, you know, finish Bloodborne, get back to Bloodborne, you know, you're you're you're into it. Like you you you've made enough progress, like keep going.\" Uh, and like the thing that like the thing that makes me but the thing that that pauses my progress in a game like Blood Bloodborne is the fact that everything in that game is so mysterious",

Sony has confirmed to the Verge that you won't be able to expand that blazing fast SSD storage on day one.

Cerny said, \"What's the holdup?\" As Cernney explained, not all N.2 SSDs are fast enough to keep up with the PS5. Thin enough to to fit in the SSD in the SSD bay or compatible with Sony's IO controller. And Sony promised to do compatibility testing late this year to make sure. At the very least, Cerni suggested off-the-shelf SSDs would need to deliver more than 5.5 gigabytes a second of bandwidth over a PC IE Gen 4 connection and not have a giant heat sink so large that they won't fit into the PS5's drive bay.

It's one of the most requested features since the launch of the PlayStation 4 and now with the latest system software 4.0. You can sort your mostused games and apps into folders that are easily accessible from the PlayStation 4 home screen.

So like when I go to my game library and my collection is the first tab right now that includes all my PlayStation 5 stuff and all my PlayStation 4 digital games. It's at 800 games right now. But now when I sort it, it sorts instantaneously. When I scroll really fast and it just like and like get",

It's not how it used to be of scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll and then wait for everything to slowly load in and catch up to where I was. And what I'm saying about that is not having the folders, just having your most recent stuff in the front. All right, whatever. But when you get over to game library and you have your collection and then the next tab is installed, like there it is, all the 16 games I have installed that I can click on and go off of right away and get into it.

Um and like I get why on the Play PlayStation side they do it because like yeah this UI is way better than the PS4 UI. I prefer it. It's quicker. It's all the things I want.

And granted, I would have touched it next week, but I would have what I would have been totally lost in playing probably Assassin's Creed and Sack Boy and even Demon Souls. I want to try like in February. I feel like that actually gets at least a night of our attention and a stream probably of us sitting down and playing it and see if we dig if vibe with it.

And yeah, that you know what I talked about with Miles Morales being shorter, but platinuming it right of like, you know, right around 15 hours probably in total for Miles to Platinum and that's skipping cut scenes on New Game Plus and a bunch other stuff.

It is from uh I can't remember the name of this the studio but it's Annaperna published and it's from the same studio that did Abzu if that helps you put put it into perspective. And so you have people that like worked on games like Journey uh uh uh working on this game, right? Austin Winry, I believe, is doing the the soundtrack for this game.

Uh I I feel like the story was a bit of a missed opportunity here. And then also I feel like the detection can be pretty harsh sometimes in terms of what hits what hits you and what doesn't. Um, and that that I feel like it it's a mix it's a mix of man this is pretty harsh and then also like how I I don't know if they're teaching the player enough like how to dodge certain things because in the game there's like a slowdown mechanic where you hold R1 and then you can like dodge left and right in slow motion. And I find that like most of the time I try to do that. I like the the the detection still follows me. And a thing that Meron mentioned was like, hey, you got to wait until after the the the bullet leaves your enemy's gun, then you're going to be able to you're going to be free to like slide left and right. And that's a thing that I feel like",

Um, but still like fantastic game. Uh, number five, you know, that sits I think it sits right right there at that spot. Beautiful. We'll see how the list continues to evolve.

I know Tim and I were talking about maybe trying to do some kind of stream when that embargo goes up where we could just go there and answer questions live and do a bunch of stuff. Even if you wanted to respond, maybe even in the YouTube comments of this episode of PS I love you XOXO with your uh comments. Maybe we get a special video up even on the same day answering some of those questions. But I digress. For this show, patreon.com/confames, we ask you to go there and give us your PSN profile for segments we call trophies and chill. This is where you give us your Saab story about your PSN profile, why you're proud of it, why you're embarrassed, whatever is going on with your trophy count.

KDG writes in and says, \"With the end of this generation, I thought now would be the perfect time to submit my trophy list to you. since this is the PlayStation generation that got me quote unquote in. I used to be an Xbox just because everyone I knew defaulted to it. And I only got my first ever Sony console at the age of 27 in 2017. Yeah, that's right. That that sounded weird when I said it, right? Yeah. No, like 2017 27. Got it everybody. Uh, in large part thanks to Greg's enthusiasm, I quickly became addicted in both the exclusives and trophies until now. I'm all in with a PlayStation 5 pre-ordered, which will be my main console going forward. My first ever platinum was God of War in 2018, and I'm currently working on my 10th, which will be The Last of Us Part Two. I'm playing New",

My first ever platinum was God of War in 2018, and I'm currently working on my 10th, which will be The Last of Us Part Two. I'm playing New Game Plus now. I took a break right after beating it because it was so emotionally draining. That should time up well with my PlayStation 5 arriving with Miles Morales. Something to point out is although I don't have any uncharted platinums, that's because I played them all back to back and didn't want to burn out. Uh I made sure to get the trophies in one through three apart from playing on crushing. So I'm set to get them naturally when I want to do another playthrough. I'm also still working on Patapon 2. Why Greg? Why do this to me when I have no rhythm? And have a backlog of about a dozen other PS4 games. Do your worst smiley emoji.

Nine platinums. Now, hold on a second. Katie said, I thought she said she had 10 here, didn't working on her 10th, which will be last part, too. So, okay. Okay. Okay. So yeah, right at the top there is last part two. She has 16 of 51 trophies in Marvel's Avengers. Those are rookie numbers. Pump those up. Got the platinum in Ghost Sushima working on Patapon 2.

It was very annoying and the windows were very small.

I'm jealous of the God of War Platinum because that was a platinum that I I I wanted to get, but for I I forget what happened.
