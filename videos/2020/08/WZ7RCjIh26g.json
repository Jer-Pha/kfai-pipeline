I want it all though. Uh, you know who else wants it all, ladies and gentlemen? My two co-hosts today. Joey Noel is the first one in the movie rose herself. Joey, how you doing? Pretty good. Just wishing that I had coffee. At least we're talking about that right before the show started. And I realized I messed up today. Um, it's okay because tomorrow is the exact same day as today.

Um, not intentionally, but I like that you think that I put that much thought into it. I I like to think major Jesse Spano vibes. It 100% has major Jess V, very much Jesse Spano vibes. I like to believe that we all put a ton of effort and thought into this show in particular. But uh listen, if you want me to start dressing according to the stories, absolutely.

Here's the thing. It doesn't look great. Am I still going to watch it? Absolutely. 100%. It looks better than the original Save by the Bell, but that's not saying much because the original Save by the Bell was like a, you know, multic-cam sitcom. I guess that's true. Yeah.

Are we going here?\" And then Elizabeth Berkeley, Jesse SP just snatches it out of her hand and she goes, \"You can't use these because at first you're going to use them and you're going to get excited. Then you're going to keep using them. You're going to be really excited, but then you're going to be too excited.\" I like that she just plays into it and it's just what I appreciate reboots that we're getting is that they're not they know what they are.

But what I'm saying is u on a real note, a lot of people, she took a lot of [\u00a0__\u00a0] for that movie and I basically ended her career as a film actress because of how outrageous the performance was.

So basically she was like I don't want to play this role this way and he kept pushing take after take after take for her to be more outrageous and then when you see it on screen she comes off like an insane human being and nobody in the scenes are like what like none of it makes any sense. It's just I think in my opinion a movie where it just they went for something and man it didn't work and unfortunately the person that should have taken the [\u00a0__\u00a0] for it which I think Paul Vovan did take some [\u00a0__\u00a0] for it because he got",

It's meant for It's meant for young young adults or young teenagers to watch just like we watched it all in the '90s.

Um and it's a significantly different design. Um, the character is sleeker. It doesn't have armor. It looks a lot more alien. It doesn't look as quite as humanoid uh as the original one. And I don't know if we can pull that up or not, but it's interesting. It's interesting that he wanted to change the the look of Stephen Wolf as well. We're getting these just like trickle weekly updates to this. Well, it's weird because it's it's such a weird world we live in because the um There we go. We can see it right there.

Um it's also nice to get special edition on like the features on the Blu-rays and things like that, like the DVD, like the commentaries, the behind the scenes stuff where those are always so cool to see.

And that's just because I think the jokes themselves and the delivery of the jokes are smarter than that. They don't need them.

So, uh, I knew some production, uh, ideas that could potentially quote unquote help like amp up quality",

So, uh, I knew some production, uh, ideas that could potentially quote unquote help like amp up quality while at the same time not sacrificing necessarily, uh, um, anything else, I guess. So, the idea was more of a short format, like what is an the more most interesting way to go about it. Um, and also we uh were very big on the idea of YouTube back then. So, uh, what I liked from YouTube was actually vlogging. So, that was how I got the idea. I was like, oh, an animated vlog. Um, and so it kind of was born from this uh need, but uh I thought it was a really interesting challenge to just try and um fit as much story as you can in just 5 minutes. I think and I think you you all do that really really well. specifically. One of the things I think is cool is just your use of the camera and and uh the vlog style of there's one shot where she puts the camera down as her aunt enters the room and",

I imagine that's sort of like to solve the the production conundrum of we don't have a ton of time and resources. Uh, but it still tells the story in a very endearing way and enders you to the character as well because we've all been there where we've gone to cut footage and been like, \"What was I thinking when I pointed the camera away from my face for 15 minutes and talked?\" Uh, and it also feels so real to like the vlogging style of like, \"Oh, well, uh, I'm going to put this down so she doesn't know that I'm doing this.\" And it feels really organic and doesn't",

Oh, thank you. So, how how did you come across the idea of uh of of what the character wants to do to be to to be this sort of like record keeper and go out into the world? So, the prelude idea was uh also born out of a need. We my coowriter co-developer Josh and I um we already came up with like what the idea of a full season would be, which is she's a record keeper. She's out there and a lot of building from that full season was building the idea of like how did she get here? we still have to build the season around like her wants, her needs, like what she experiences. Um, and then one of our other ideas were like uh now that we how do how do we pitch I guess this full season, how can we try and convince people to watch it because it is a",

Um, and it is uh we'd want to introduce people to like a new way of watching something and this like new IP. It is new characters and new settings. So, how what's the best way? And we thought, okay, let's let's maybe do a four-part prelude. Um, former writer and creative at Rooster Teeth, Joe Nicoloi, he actually gave us this idea of like, what if we actually do this short series of her in her bedroom like vlogging about it? And then that's where we kind of got that I got this thing and it was a great foundation for us to build out on like, okay, this is the character now. like we can actually hit on like um some hints as to what she wants to do or what would fuel her in her actual journey. Um so yeah, I think it does. I think it works very",

I think it works very well to introduce you to the the world and the characters um in a way that feels pretty organic and it's kind of cool to watch and unique to watch. Um, even though I myself can't stand looking at myself on camera, but it's the thought of a thought of someone vlogging in an animated series is actually kind of hilariously meta when you think about it, considering considering all the effort that goes into drawing one cell. Um, on that note, I mean, the style of this is amazing. What was your inspiration for that? Was that was that is that sort of your style or is that something that you went out and looked for? Uh, there was some looking. Um, well, I know the first thing I did was I wanted to know if there was any other vlogging animated shows out there. And there is actually. There's one uh a",

Um it's been going on for a long time, but not not narrative or not serial necessarily. It's a bit more on the comedic side. So, um I was looking just to compare uh like styles of that, but majority of what I consider recorded by RSL is a combination of my style and also really relying on everyone else to build out like the rest of the world. Um I did have I did do the character uh character designs and the turnarounds for this one, but like backgrounds, all of that like my art the art team that worked on this did like super well. That's very well done. specifically. I mean, even even the opening shots of her in the room, just the background images, the pictures, the the the I forget what they're",

Yeah, they're really really cool. Um, so where are you at right now in in the overall process? Is there are you going to continue this sort of vibe all the way out through as you start making the episodes or where are you at right now? So, uh, the payload's done. Uh we're doing um I I guess backstage is like we're just talking about like uh what else we can do for full season or quote unquote we are still waiting um we're still trying to uh get the word out there and I guess facil or figure out and uh facilitate how audience reacted um what are some strategies in the future that we can do but for me I think it's like the oh my dog barked I think it's like super I'm really happy and I'm really grateful that the uh uh that um",

Uh it's not your standard like I said. Um so riding that wave uh uh I'm restrategizing as to like how we could do what a full season looks like. Um but yeah. Yeah. So when you say when you think full season, do you think we're going to stick with the sort of the format that we've established already for this or do are you wanting to do more of a traditional sort of narrative format for the animated series? Uh the idea we've always had was kind of sticking to the format. So vlogging. Yeah. Um but the prelude was very like kind of strictly vlogging. Uh what we've always wanted for this series itself was actually a mix. So kind of like a surprise of like just randomly breaking rules. Um it always",

Uh but then one of the ideas we had is suddenly you there is an episode where you do see it's just a regular episode or it's not necessarily facilitated by a camera. Um the way I compare it is like if it's a video game uh you're used to gameplay and then suddenly like Final Fantasy 7 remake drops you in a cinematic, right? So I that's how I would like to um format the show and then it's just like you're used to something but then when something significant happens that's where the break is and that's when you the audience know that you're paying attention. That's funny you say Final Fantasy. I have no zero context for that whatsoever. I've never played that Final Fantasy game but it does remind me of like Seinfeld starting and",

Um, so I think it's a really cool device and obviously it's a really great way to get across information that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do exposition-wise unless you have the I mean literally you have your character uh able to just sit there and tell the audience what's going on and setting up some some um the entire world within the span of two sentences which is pretty cool.
