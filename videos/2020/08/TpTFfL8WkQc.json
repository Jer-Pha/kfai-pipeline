And you used to open it up and it was basically trying to get it basically taught kids how to get addicted to chewing tobacco. And I loved it. I liked that and I liked the gum cigarettes. And apparently it worked because I was horribly addicted to cigarettes for a very long time. But to me, a bag of shredded cheese is like the healthier version of chewing tobacco. And I love it. Fair.
