She's been in a number of films. Thank you. Sure. That doesn't help you actually. Doesn't help you at all at all. But it's fun to it's fun to watch you figure it out, right? See the confusion in their eyes. See, I have my my phone in my hand right now. For everyone, the enjoyment will have to be like watching their face light up.

I was down in doing theater in like a random South Georgia. And an agent from LA was there with her family. Yeah. She came up to my mom and was like, you know, I think your daughter's really talented. I don't know if you're ever going to come to LA, but if you do, like, look me up. My mom was kind of like, thanks. We're not really that's not really the goal. We're happy in Atlanta, Georgia, the home of Coca-Cola. Yeah, we're we're good with that with that.
