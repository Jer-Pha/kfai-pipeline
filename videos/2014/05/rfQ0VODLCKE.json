If you like that, like the video, subscribe to us on YouTube, share us with your friend, and buy the Oreo gasm over at districtlines.com/gameover. Greggy. Today we're reviewing the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Oreo. Now, this motherfucker's been all up in the news lately. People just excited cuz you remember there was the bastardized version of the the the like the the Dr. Frankenstein's version where they took real Reese's peanut butter cups and like Buzzfeed's all like, \"Oh, and you put the Oreo around him.\" And people were like, \"That's awesome and fattening.\" And then Oreo is like, \"Well, [\u00a0__\u00a0] that. We'll make our own one. Hey Reese's, you want some money?\" And",

Hey Reese's, you want some money?\" And Reese's is like, \"Please, no one eats this candy anymore. Please put us in with your cookies.\" And they're like, \"Here we go.\" So, let's get to it. Of course, every oration begins with the patented first look. Okay. Okay. There's some missing at the top. Yeah. Stuck them in there. And you see a lot. Oh, whoa. There is the peanut butter. It is coming through loud and clear. Similar to my dog squeaking his toy over there. But the first look, we're missing some at the top. It's you're getting a lot of the browns like the the like the poop brown, not the tan brown. You're getting a lot of the poop browns and some of the crumbs shoved in there, but they're there and they got a good they got a good bouquet of peanut butter. I will tell you right now, they smell a lot like peanut butter. So,",

Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] These things really taste like a Reese's peanut butter cup. Like I don't know. Yeah. Oh my god. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Come here, Py. They made a cookie that tastes like a Reese's peanut butter. No, don't eat it. I'm going back for more. But yeah, it really like like I was talking about that bastardized version they made, right, with the Reese's peanut butter in there. That's what it tastes like. This actually tastes good. I was expecting disaster, huh? Well, [\u00a0__\u00a0] man. Um, thank you, PTO. They're really good. I'm a big fan. Um, of course, if we're we're still in the taste right now, but if you wanted the first look, you got it there. The big thing about them, right? Of course. You got the tan part, the",

You got the tan part, the chocolate part, the peanut butter and the chocolate right there on the same cookie. I'll tell you right now, I don't taste the Oreo at all in it. It tastes like it's got it's got crunch of an Oreo, but you don't taste the chocolate. It's the hub cap, if you will. But it's good. Let's see how it pairs with milk. Time for the patented Mac Elroy moment. You know, I was saying his name wrong this whole time. Nobody told me. One, two, three. I got a good bite. I got the even parts of the chocolate and the peanut butter, but the milk actually takes away from it. Doesn't taste anymore as much like a Reese's. Hold on. I'm going back. One, two, three. Mroy. Who would have thought? Wow. This cookie is a weird thing. This cookie is a weird [\u00a0__\u00a0] When you eat it straight away, tastes like a Reese's",

That's when the Oreo cookie really starts to shine. They're normal. I'm doing it again. Wow. Wow. Nabiscoco, my hats are off to you. Let's do a twist test. Now, look at this lopsided [\u00a0__\u00a0] I don't know what it was thinking. It looks smooshed. It looks all weird. And this isn't like This one's smooshed, too. There's something going on. So, I'm not a fan of that. Got some packaging problems here. We'll twist them all the same. Perfect twist. Of course, we got two out of three here on oration. The oration nailed it again. But now you see you got to be very careful how you put them together because look at that thing. What the hell is that? You get you get one perfect bite on this half and then over here this the",

No, I meant turn them around so they match perfectly because they're off angle. Why don't you go [\u00a0__\u00a0] yourself, Nick? How about that? Fair enough. Turn what around so they match perfect. Oh, you're saying why don't I rotate them like that? Cuz I'm eating the cookies. I'm not here to [\u00a0__\u00a0] be a goddamn geomet over here being like, \"Well, this is how they all go together to make a per I mean, I'll try again for you.\" So, you got this one smooshed all wrong.

We got a cookie that tastes just like it's advertised for once, right? The winter ones don't taste like winter cuz that nothing tastes like winter. But the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups taste like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, but bad first look. They all They all look like they were hastily put together like you know infidels were invading the factory and they're like [\u00a0__\u00a0] get them out the door man. This is what we got to do. I like these cookies. So a final score on the 20 point scale. Remember you want you want to chew that down first? I don't want to chew it down, Nick. I want to do the show. All right.

They're as close to perfect as you can get, except for their shitty packaging and the fact that they're all lopsided, but they are delicious. Like, are we are we eating cookies here because we want them to look good? No. We're eating cookies to get past a lot of trauma we've been through. And these will do it, man. These are the cookies you've been waiting for. They taste like Reese's. They are just as advertised. They are fantastic. 9.5. Amazing here on the Oreo Oration review scale.
