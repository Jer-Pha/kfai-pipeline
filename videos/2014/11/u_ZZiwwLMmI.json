Obviously, no one comes away from a head-on collision with a driver on drugs all that well. But sadly, his wife is in a whole bunch of trouble. She's in the hospital right now. They're working on her. They're trying to, you know, basically piece it all back together, her their life, figure everything out.

All right, if you haven't seen Fast 6, stop watching this. Go watch that [\u00a0__\u00a0] Well, don't stop watching. Just skip ahead. Just mute. Just Just mute it and then watch it. So, Fast Six ends. Mhm. Trail or credits start. Then all of a sudden, it goes bam. And we're back in Tokyo, right? What are we doing? What are we doing? This is what every Fast fan had wanted for years. We're in the square, right? We're finally getting back to it. And we see Han driving through Tokyo. Bam. Gets hit by a car. The death scene we saw from Tokyo Drift again. Now, did that hurt? Yeah, that hurt bad. That hurt. It just happened yesterday. Yeah. Yeah. But did we expect to see Jason Stathithm get out of that car and be like, Dominic Tretto, you don't know me. But you're about to. But you're about to. Pod blows up in the background",

Now, the thing was, try sand effect. That theater, I've never been in a theater. Like I've been in midnight releases before. I've been in like a bunch of stuff. Nothing compared to that theater. Every single person was just like this [\u00a0__\u00a0] series doesn't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] No, they don't care. It was awesome. They do care though. They care about fans so much. Exactly. The theater was full of people that were like, \"Good lord.\" That was a good moment. That was cool. That's one of my moments. Not that obviously, but being with being being I still haven't seen that movie. I started it drunk, then I fell asleep, and then I still got back to it. I'm like, whatever.",

Um, my my similar moment I've talked about I think here is Avengers. Avengers being such a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ride that entire movie. So much fun. Every it was a midnight release. Everybody there was a comic book fan. and we're all along. We're cheering. We're doing all the dumb stuff. But like when Thanos pops up, again, spoilers as the postredit scene or you know, not even the postredits, but the first postredit scene, right? And like when he turns and looks over his shoulder and does that grin, I'll never forget the girl in front of me standing up and going, \"Oh my god.\" Like like she had just won a car on Oprah.

But like wrapping my head around it, like if Man of Steel ended in Dark Side was there, I don't think I would have been like like literally freaking the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out. But everyone in that theater flipped the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out and it was awesome. It was a great time. And I left and I was with Damon. I was like that was like the most fun I've had at the movies ever, probably ever.

And uh when um Raphael meets Casey Jones for the first time in the park, that's a really awesome little scene, like an inter interchange between them. And I love Casey Jones so much. Just that specific Casey Jones is my like my favorite. I just love the idea of that character.

It's like awesome. That was cool. Just a really awesome movie. That movie really holds up too. I watch that movie like once a year and I'm like I [\u00a0__\u00a0] love this movie. This is so good. That's why just looking at that I didn't even watch and I will not watch that new movie.
