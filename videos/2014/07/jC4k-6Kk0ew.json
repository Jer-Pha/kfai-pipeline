    "description": "Going to Greg Miller's favorite restaurant of all time for the first time? Here's what you HAVE to order at Portillo's.\n\nWhere is closest Portillo's? Find out: http://www.portillos.com/portillos/locations/\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=gameovergreggy\n\nBuy our shirts! http://www.districtlines.com/gameovergreggy\n\nFollow Greg on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\n\n---\n\nHey--\n\nAs many of you know, my favorite restaurant on the planet is Portillo's Hot Dogs. Hell, I bought a wiener dog like the one in the restaurant's logo and named it Portillo.\n\nIn 1963, Dick Portillo started his first hot dog stand -- the Dog House -- and over the next 50 years, it has spawned into dozens of locations around the Chicagoland area. There are even a few down by LA, one in Indiana, and a couple in Arizona.\n\nAnyway, as much as I talk about Portillo's, one of the most common Tweets I get is what a visitor should get on his or her first time. I try to respond to each Tweet and even have blasted the order to all my followers with the message \"FAVORITE THIS TWEET IF YOU'RE EVER GOING TO PORTILLO'S,\" but the 'What should I get?\" Tweets keep coming.\n\nNow, I can just send them to this vlog. Below is the order. It is a lot of food and not my regular order, but it's the order I suggest for \"This is my one and only time at Portillo's.\"\n\n1) A hot dog with everything.\n\n2) An Italian beef with hot peppers and mozzarella cheese.\n\n3) Cheese fries.\n\n4) A chocolate cake shake.\n\nNow, if you're a Chicago native and are warming up to comment below that Gene & Jude's is a better place or that visitors should go to Wiener Circle, STFU and GTFO. Portillo's is home to me. Period. When i go back to Chicago, it's the one constant. Walking into the place reminds me of after-school lunches with my grandmother, when the North Ave. location caught fire and my parents woke me up to go watch and mourn, the same order I've been placing (two hot dogs ketchup, mustard and pickle only) my entire life.\n\nI'm not a hot dog connoisseur -- I'm a Portillo's devotee, and I always will be.\n\nGreg",
