I'm doing well, thanks Greg. You're looking good, the beer's looking good. Greg, you survived VidCon. I did survive VidCon. Barely, narrowly. And by the time this posts, hopefully RTX. Oh, RTX is going to be so good. It's going to be so good. Austin, we're going to eat a lot of food. We're going to eat a ton of food. All barbecue, all lean protein, I'm hoping. No, I'm going to go to Act That Gordo's. Over here, the pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. Go Islanders! Go Islanders indeed. And our special guest from Giant Bomb, Jeff Gersman. Hi, how's it going? Hey, there we go. I said I wouldn't come if you guys didn't clap. We almost blew it. We almost blew it right up. Okay, alright. Now you're just fine. Alright, good.

No, it doesn't. Well, of course everybody. It was fantastic. You guys had a great time. It was so good. Bernie's awesome. The reason we don't know if it's up after RTX is the fact that the Game Over Gregi Show posts every Friday as an MP3 on GameOverGregi.Bandcamp.com for $1. If you don't think we're worth that dollar, you can pick us up on YouTube Monday through Friday. Every topic's broken out one by one. YouTube.com slash Game Over Gregi.

Yeah, it's a pain in the butt. Especially with me running it. I just twist knobs constantly. Doing video on the road, it's just like at any moment, it might all just catch on fire. I don't know. These cameras all got stolen. Who knows? It's funny. I hate the differences when you go place to place. I've been to PAX where they're like, don't touch the board. We are union workers now.

You said, don't jack off on the board. But is that appropriate? I know that's fine. I know, I like how you stopped yourself. No, let's roll this back. What's up everybody? I'm here to kind of train you guys for your internet. Just roll it back, the jack off thing. Not cool. A little creepy. It's about time a real producer came in here. Yeah, exactly. Thank you. Can you please take over? Every single time we say something inappropriate, Greg makes me bleep it. No, see, I make him bleep when he mentions people's names he shouldn't mention.

So it took me a day and a half to get home. You should have packed a second Portillo's lunch. So I did. And so I was in a Motel 6 like late that night just with the one Portillo just the sandwich going there's a microwave in this room this is perfect and just like eating it and just like watching baseball on like a 4x3 TV and still like the sandwich loves me.

And he sent us nine bottles of the bourbon. Whoo. That's an expensive thing. So first of all Eric Castro is the man we really appreciate that so what it says. So we picked out. Yeah. Please report. We picked out barrel number one two two five from the year 2003. This was barreled on 10 603 October 6 2003 when I was at Northeastern University still. So it's a different place back there.

You can't just put ice in a glass you gotta chip it away with your cool vests and your bow tie and your suspenders. It's a show.

See if I could pay eight dollars for that cocktail and just get ice cubes. You'd be alright with that. I'd be alright with that. Okay. Now here's the thing I was thinking about. I've been you guys haven't been to the bar yet so you can you can tell me when you go. It's like an old school kind of early 20th century inspired vibe there like a soda fountain kind of almost. And they had some old paintings of all the portraits. Now I wonder. Do the eyes move with? Kind of like the tickly mops.

Yeah absolutely. What's crazy is I never really realized that at this angle Colin is looking right at me. So as you're looking at me you're also looking at me. My favorite part is like last week I was like hey Nick this is really crooked and you said it looks good on camera and then I watched the show and it did.

Well look guys I'm at this conundrum like the quality of my life is questionable at this point because I watch wrestling and I hate wrestling and I can't stop watching wrestling. So why do you watch it? Why do you keep watching wrestling? Because you can't stop. Because I can't stop watching wrestling. You don't know how an addiction works? Oh I know how addictions work.

I was like it's kind of funny she starts watching the show I come back a week later from a trip she's gotten she's seen all of them she now wants to go back on Xbox Live and buy the first season of the show. So we do it and I watch it and now I'm like now I have to watch the second season of the show that you already watched. It's a great show. It's debatable. It's super good. So my problem.

Comic books, science fiction movies, video games, wrestling like all these things kind of fit together you know horror movies whatever it ends up being. People it's fine that people are passionate about it but people are just are tearing things apart and it feels like that just every conversation online that I'm in nowadays it's just extreme one way or the other.

So I fell out of it. No one knows that is Greg. No one knows that is. I fell out of it and kind of. They know what I'm talking about. I fell out of it kind of came back when the NWO got big. Because it became like the storyline got a little edgier a little more reality based where you were like it blurred the lines. Obviously you knew it was still being written it was still a show but the storylines had become more than just like I'm going to beat the bad guy.

I'm just going to say XL because I feel bad if I say XXL but that's usually the safe answer and well. My answer is always because I'm in between a medium and a large because just because of my pregnant gut. Because of your baby. And my question is always is the shirt pre-shrunk? That's how I always preface it and usually the answer is I have no idea. Right. And I'm like well. You can't take that risk. No. I have some shirts.

I bleached my hair a handful of times over the years. Did you ever frost your tips because I desperately want to frost my tips. No but so I would only bleach my hair once and then let it grow out. So you would eventually get to that point where it basically was frosted tips. That's my recollection of every single time I've seen Clements. He's always got like that like half grown out frosted tip look. Yeah he's got crazy cool hair. Because he just does crazy stuff to his hair all the time.
