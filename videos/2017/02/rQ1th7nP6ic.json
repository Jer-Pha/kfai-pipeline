It's not immediately clear what Hines means by most successful. Skyrim was released in November 2011, sold more than 20 million copies as of 2014.

The game shipped 5 million copies on its first day, setting a new franchise record. In January, Square announced the figure rose to six million copies shipped. The company has not yet said how many copies of the game have actually been sold to consumers. Um, before Final Fantasy 15 came out, Tbata said the game needed to sell 10 million copies to be a success. He later clarified that comment, stating that 10 million is the studio's personal goal, not necessarily how many units it needs to turn a profit.

So, it's just it's because they want to push hardware. Yeah. They they control the ecosystem. Uh here's a little thing that you guys need to know about hardware and why hardware is important.

That's not a huge surprise considering I think only nine cabinet appointments in US history have ever been denied because it really is differential.
