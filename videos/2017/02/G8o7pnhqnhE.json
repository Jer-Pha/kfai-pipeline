Like being angry, having like being just in some sort of weird emotional turmoil is what Colin wants to be. You know? Angry is like too much. Angry requires too much emotional. It's just mildly annoyed. Mildly annoyed is where Colin likes to be. Greg on the other hand used to like fun. Yes.

I don't like it either. There's something about the angle and like I still want to figure out the implementation a bit better. It's the fact that there's no depth of feel to it. So he looks like a goddamn like giant. Yeah, and it's like, then it's just the same. Did you show Nick the FlyCam? No. Because I feel like Nick might like it. I've seen the FlyCam. Have you?

Given the lack of details so far in the Virtual Console and given Nintendo's history, it's fair to expect the worst despite our brief optimism that they might get things right this time. In the same press release, Nintendo added that Fast Remix and Shovel Knight, including all the new campaigns for the DLC, will both launch alongside the Switch on March 3rd. You'll also be able to transfer your funds from other Nintendo devices after linking your Nintendo Network ID and Nintendo account and then their Nintendo account to your Nintendo Switch system, which is hopefully less confusing than it sounds.

Virtual Console, not at launch, not cool. However, I would much rather them not put the Virtual Console out and trickle and get a bunch of shit, get the GameCube, because here's the thing. All the rumors we've heard about Virtual Console on the Switch is that it is being made by the same group of guys that did the NES Classic. NES Classic's emulation is fantastic. The Wii and Wii U's Virtual Console emulation of NES games, SNES games, SNES is trash. Super dark. The image looks like shit.

Melee, Luigi's Mansion, Mario Sunshine are the rumored lineup to launch with the Virtual Console. Lovely. And everyone expected that to come at launch. Because that would make sense.

No, it's at your discretion, Kevin. You're the producer. So if you don't like it, you throw it out, you take it. You take it real tight and you cram it into your body. Because it's a compilation and the one that they sent is really stupid. Like I watched it and I was like, damn, they thought that was funny? But then I clicked around. There's definitely other funny ones. We'll see. We'll see how long we're going. Placenta Milkshake says, can you tell my cousin that Final Fantasy XV is a bad game?
