Like are you talking about me or Oh, you you you personally? Yeah. But it's also I think part of the Bethesda character maybe. And then I'm going to ask you, do you remember our first interaction on Twitter? Okay. Which one do you want me to answer first? The interaction one? No. Okay. Colin and I on Beyond early on were talking [\u00a0__\u00a0] about Skyrim and how it wasn't running on PS3 and how like it was crashing all this stuff and this is well doc it was already we knew there the problem was out",

And we were doing the thing of like we by the way this is when you're still at IGM correct? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so we're like this is like as it's happening. So this is what when did Skyrim on PS3 was Was it 11 11? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So this was probably like December. Exactly. That Yeah. Right after the new year or something. And we're talking about it and uh a fan tweeted you saying, \"Hey, the guys on Beyond have a question about why this isn't running.\" And you responded back to him. He's like, \"I've tried to talk to IGN. I'm not doing it again.\" And I was like, \"Hey, we haven't I'm Whoa, I haven't talked to you and I'm sorry.\" And you were just like, \"I've tried to talk.\" And",

You are out there on the front lines tweeting and talking all the time and answering fans and answering PR people and press people and all and and it's just I don't why are why do you think you're able to do that? Why are you like that and other people can't be? Why can you be so opinionated? Whereas like if you were to talk like I guess like think about like you're in terms of presence, in terms of talking for a company, you are equivalent to Shu Yosha for PlayStation cuz she will respond and talk and he'll he'll take photos at a Nintendo event and no everybody's like, \"Okay, cool.\" You'll go out and tweet about what you're playing",

That's I wasn't prepared for this question. I like to give you something new. You know what I mean? Just cuz we did we did a 2hour pre-in yesterday doesn't mean I'm not going to have stuff for you today. First of all, I'm relieved that I wasn't a huge prick to you when when we interacted on on Twitter. It's and I uh correct me if I'm wrong audience, but I want to say we've done a kind of funny video since then that maybe it was a Q&A, maybe it was something and somebody's like, \"Who would you want on the show?\" I was like you because I felt like not that there",

Number one, important to realize that in a lot of ways, my my background at Bethesda is very much what an indie shop would look like. 1999, I get hired by that company to be the director of PR and marketing. Um, it was a handful of devs, the president, a sales assistant, I had a marketing artist, Todd Vaughn, our VP of development or director of development, I guess, at the time, was there. And like, as far as Bethesda goes, that was about it. So, for the first until 2005, I think, is when I hired uh Aaron Losi uh to come in and do actual PR and marketing with with me. I did all the community stuff. I did all the PR. I did all the marketing. whatever it was, like I did it. I worked on the box. I worked on the ads. I worked on the trailers. I was in the forums talking to people. Like, that was just what I knew. And I I'm a big believer in as as much as",

Um because um things that I say where I'm like, you know, joking and like, you know, trying to be funny and somebody takes it as a complete insult or backhanded slap or I'm being a like, \"Ooh, why are you so savage?\" Like savage. Like somebody asked me like how the answer to a question to your point like I have 140 characters. Like you could just Google that. Like you don't really right. Like so like I I remember the specific incident recently where somebody asked me a question. And I was like, \"Look, if you Google from my name or Todd's name and about this, like you you'll find a number of interviews with that.\" And I got this feedback from a couple",

Like I I don't just get to go on and on like I get to do here with you where I get to provide the proper context and so forth.\" But the the base thing is I I do think that level of interaction is important. Now, I I am uh by far uh not the not the only person at our company who does that. I have an amazing global community lead, Matt Grandst Staff, who works with our community team and Jess and Jason and Evan and Jess and Jess.

I'm just a guy at Bethesda trying to do my job the best I can. And sometimes maybe I'm a little bit more candid than I should be. Somebody once asked me like, \"How do you deal with all of the like hate or like people answering you, asking you about TE 6 and when it's coming out or or uh to to confirm or deny some rumor about a game?\" Like, well, truth of the is every now and then I just try and be a little funny or whatever to like let a little steam off and not in a mean way, but hopefully just I mean sometimes it's mean, but if it's mean, it's 100% of the time because it's directed at an [\u00a0__\u00a0] who just says something like, you know, [\u00a0__\u00a0] you and [\u00a0__\u00a0] Bethesda and you suck and like, yeah, I'll give that guy [\u00a0__\u00a0] back.",

I don't care. Most of the time I just go in and mute them cuz I love I love the idea of people screaming into the void and thinking that I this is my argument. Me and Colin argues I got to block. I'm like no no no don't block them. Like I I block people who are like who way overdo it and it gets to the point where it's like that like I've had people threaten my kids like you know people get Skyrim uh PS3 did me no favors cuz they're looking to scream at somebody. They don't want they don't want to scream at a building, right? They want to scream at a guy. Like even if it's not the guy in charge, I want a face.

Uncle Touchy's naked puzzle basement somewhere like screaming into the dark corner. Um that's a Patton Oswald reference for for the fans out there.

I to if it's not worth 60 bucks to you, I totally get it. And that people take that as like, oh, you're just being a jerk. Like, no, I'm not. I'm being respectful.

It was um a big part of it was I want to say it was in 2014 um I first thought and and pitched the idea to Todd specifically because I knew that that Fallout was the thing we were going to be talking about the next year and it was um one hey",

It really takes a toll on you. talking all day as you well know um is is not an easy thing to do like it physically wears on you. Um but the other thing is that everything so much of what we were doing to that point was through a filter where we were showing something we were we were showing a demo or letting people do hands-on and then what we were doing was getting filtered out to everybody else through somebody else. And there were so many times we would do a demo and then look at the previews and be like, \"God, how did nobody talk about this? How many how did nobody mention, you know, this or this or this",

Um, and by the way, not just like the fans, obviously that was a big part of it, like for them to be able to see directly, but it was also, you know, we book appointments in in past years for Skyrim or when I met you and um Colin and Colin for the Fallout 3 demo, like, well, how many people from IGN actually got to see or do any of that, right? It's one or two or whatever. And then there's that mad dash in the final day. All right, you're up for game of you're up for the game of the show. Can we bring 15 people?

Um, but everybody's kind of on the same page with the same information, the same footing.

Like it takes time away like cuz there's games aren't made like that. It's not like, \"All right, we finished everything in this level. Let's move on.\" At any given moment, any game in the world has something going on that makes it [\u00a0__\u00a0] up and completely uncapturable on video, right? There's a lighting bug, there's an animation bug, there's something, there's a collision thing, whatever it is. And so, you have to spend time on that tiny little section of the world fixing all of that stuff just in that one instance. even if that's not the way you would fix it across the whole game necessarily because E3 is coming.

My my favorite ones that we've done is always ones where we just somebody comes in and we hand the controller the fall 31 where I met you and Colin where it's just like look you got an hour uh for for us you got 57 minutes here's a controller you're going to start outside the vault and go like what do you mean go like just go wherever you want to go whatever you want to do you know we one don't don't go past this dialogue thing so you don't spo spoil the main story for everybody but otherwise do whatever the hell you want have fun and just letting people get loose in the world.

So, I went the exact opposite way just cuz I wanted to see is there anything there? How does the game adapt? What is there to do? That always speaks to me and what what you guys the quality of your games and even before like I really think you've come into your own or whatever the hell you want to say before you become like this [\u00a0__\u00a0] allstar.

I was like, \"Oh, no.\" And I played it and it started off like, \"I'm not that big of a shooter guy.\" And it totally was like, \"All right, all right.\" And then by the end, I'm like, when I put down the controller, left, I was like, \"That game's really good.\" Like, holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] Like, no wonder they let us play two hours of it.

It's not coming to PlayStation unless they fix it.\" Was that number one? I Colin talked about it yesterday for a second and I agree that it was like a brilliant move to either be like, \"Hey, we've played all our cards.

Hopefully Sony fixes it.\" But was there complete terror of like Sony be like, \"All right, well, [\u00a0__\u00a0] you.

There's rules for every console. Yeah. If you were to go out and design a game console, you you should be allowed to design the rules for this is what you can do and this is what you can't do.

So, we just had to give the a basic thing of look, it works and it's not hasn't been approved and we don't really know what's going to happen next because we just felt like we couldn't sit there and continue to say nothing when we had done as you said everything that we could and didn't really know which direction",

Um, but we could have gone straight in the toilet from there and never gotten anywhere or we could get to where we where we are today where, you know, folks from Sony, folks from Bethesda Game Studios got together and worked the problem and came up with a solution that we could get through and we said, \"Okay, well then, like that's what we're going to that's what we're going to do.\" Um, but yeah, I just think at that point we felt like it had been long enough and we had done I I guess everything we felt like we could do that was in our power and we needed to say something because at the end of the day it was it was our fans.
