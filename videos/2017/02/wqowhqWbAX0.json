I have every Star Wars figure in every vehicle and every playset and every package including specials from 1995 to 2002. Gotcha. Was Watto with the data pad a big deal for you? Can I see that one? So, when episode one came out, or like, so two weeks before episode one came out or so, the toys came out. And this was in early May 1999.

Because now that I, you know, Watto, we've agreed the best character in Star Wars. People keep giving me Watto things. And every time I get a Watto figure of any kind, it's Watto with data pad. I don't remember the data pad being so important to the episode one storyline, but clearly it was because they make a big deal every time of saying Watto with data pad. That Luke though, and it wasn't as... I never was a fan of these little like 3.5 inch ones. I'm definitely a six inch guy in many ways. But I always wanted the Luke with the removable helmet.

People used to also call ATST's chickenwalkers and you don't hear that very often anymore either. So there's a lot of Star Wars revisionist history going on.

I think that it's a very old way of fermenting and creating drinks. For a lot of civilizations, it was the only safe way to drink and to get liquids in you, which is why beer was so common, for instance, in Middle Ages and Renaissance Europe. So I think there's something in us that makes us want to drink. Things unrelated to each other, many have stumbled upon the fermented alcohol kind of thing by themselves. That's interesting and that's not really a coincidence. So I think that there's something to be said about that.

I wouldn't like lose my mind. You know, like I would there are other things that I would rather do than drink. And you have to choose your vices in that respect.

That's pretty much all I drink. So I also think that that kind of context is important as well. That like, you know, I remember drinking my first beer at my friend's brother's graduation party when I was like 10 or 11. And I was like, this is fucking disgusting. And I remember smoking my first cigarette and thinking like, this is disgusting and all that. But then it's weird how it grows on you. Right. That's what I always think about when",

I remember, you know, you went around to all your friends who were going to this party and you got this giant list and it was like pucker and Mike's hard lemonade and all these like things that don't taste like alcohol.

Perhaps you start drinking it and then you develop a taste for it. Then you eventually for something like me or whatever, want to start doing IPAs. I mean, I developed a taste for beer recently. Really? I couldn't. I hate beer. I hated beer forever. What was the gateway for you developing a taste for it? Greg Miller. Yeah. Like IPA. Being around him enough where it's just like, because my problem is like, I mean, you guys all know this about me. I have a drinking problem. If there's a drink in front of me, I like to drink it.

What about new years? I remember after you, I texted you something and Aaron said you were passed out. On new years? Yeah. But I couldn't remember if it was a cold or if it was drinking.

If you're drinking alone often, or have to drink every day, or something like that, it's everything in moderation, I agree. So why? I don't know.

Trump signed 10 executive orders since he became president. Obviously, to get legislation there, you have to get it to House and the Senate. They have to put it in the committee. They have to reconcile the bills and then they have to vote. Then he has to sign it. So these things take time. So something like the wall, for instance, or the complete repeal of Obamacare or anything else, like that's going to require Congress to do that. And so that's going to take time. But he can do more immediate things by signing these executive orders. So I thought I'd go over the 10 things that",

Yeah, I'm going to do a yea or nay thing for myself. Number one, the first thing he signed, the rollback of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. It says, Mr. Trump, and these quotes are from PBS, they're not mine. Quote, Mr. Trump has allowed all agency heads to waive requirements of the Affordable Care Act to, quote, maximum extent permitted by law, end quote. So this basically delivers what people have long called the death spiral of Obamacare, that without particularly the mandate of everyone buying insurance, then the insurance policies will start to collapse, which is going to happen soon.

Didn't he say his plan for Obamacare was basically, like, one of his spokespersons said the plan is to let the states decide still, which is pretty much Obamacare. Yeah. So if you go back to 2009, 2010, one of the major things that wasn't in Obamacare that people wanted, that conservatives really wanted, that I would have actually been on board with and actually supported the bill more was the idea that you can buy insurance anywhere. So a Californian right now under Obamacare can only buy California insurance. So if the insurance company doesn't do business in, for instance, or cannot do business in California, then you cannot buy that insurance.

And then the insurance that they had, the idea is that, say the policy is 100, I'm just using random numbers, the policy is $100 in Louisiana, it's $90 in Michigan. Now the Louisiana company realizes that it's losing all these customers. So now their policy becomes $80. And then the people in Michigan, and suddenly all the prices start to drop. I mean, that's just the market working, and that is the way it would work. But they wouldn't allow that. But isn't the market already taxed as is, though?

Everyone knew that was bullshit. Coverage is terrible, absolutely. The Nancy Pelosi thing of you'll understand what's in it when we pass it was totally true, because it was so big and so bloated.

Between Carson and McMahon, where they all know how to feed off of each other. And it's a total act for 15 minutes. Carson's kind of in on it. McMahon's kind of in on it. But it's like a whole rambling thing. It's like, but your wife's not afraid. Oh, my wife... And then they know how to feed him the lines. Yeah, set him up. Set him up. It's so fucking funny. It doesn't get much funnier than that. And the other random zeitgeist kind of comedian that I want",

Andrew Dice Clay is fucking terrible. The Dice Man. Yeah, terrible. But if you go just go... Put your mind in 88, 89, 90, 91. Go listen to his standup routines and go watch him play MSG or listen to his little comedy club things wherever before he fell off the face of the planet. They're, for the time and place, shockingly good and shockingly funny. You know, like... Well, that was the whole point with him, right? He wanted to be...

No. So I mean, the ones, like the majority of the time, ones are just like, oh man, I like the shipping was horrible and like this thing fucked up. It's never really about the product or it's about just the day they had an ability to cope with life and what was happening at the time. And there's sometimes where like, yeah, the thing just totally didn't work. But I just think that more often than not, ones are not valid. Fives are pretty much the same thing where it's like, I mean, if all of",

But I like to stay more in the three and I think four is actually the, four and two are the best places. But if it's a two, why even look at this product? You should be moving on already. Anyways, right? Like obviously number of reviews that really matters. But like it also kind of doesn't, if it's just a bunch of the stars, you got to get that threshold because if you're buying something on Amazon and it's a very popular product, it could have potentially like a thousand reviews. So is that if you see something that has four reviews and it's at five stars versus something that has 800 reviews and only at four stars, which one's more valuable towards the latter? The mass?

You go there and there's a bunch of questions. Seeing those. You're going to find the question that you have because all you're reading the review for is some very specific thing that they're not going to say in the description.

And I'm talking mainly about Amazon instant. What I like to do is go into the Amazon instant. What are the new movies? Okay, great. And like, oh, this has happened and that's happening. And forever it would be, oh man, I like everybody in this movie, but I got two stars. I'm going to waste my time on that. And then I took a bit, you know, jumped.

I mean, that's ridiculous. Yeah. Like it's definitely not. Maybe it was 4.4 and opens like a five star restaurant.

So you have to make, you have to make your own kind of decision based on your, the way you feel, you know? That's why I hate, always hated putting numbers on reviews when I was at IGM because I was like, I don't like, yeah, I'm reading the rubric. The rubric says this, this is how I feel about it. But depending on how you even read this review, that number might not even be accurate. So I don't really have any idea. So I kind of, I kind of take that rationale to Amazon and other places where I don't really deal with the, unless there's like a precipitous, like two and a half star rating in which 500 people have given it, you know, something that nets there on",

I'm just going to buy that. Right. You know, you've proven, you've proven to yourself that Crest is the brand of choice. So yeah, so to me, it's like, I'm always wary and I don't really believe anyone, what anyone says at any given time. It goes back to the fake news thing where I don't really believe anything. So, so it goes back to that as well. Like the last time I bought a product that I never, I wasn't familiar with was I bought a scale so I can obsess over my weight. That was a really smart decision.
