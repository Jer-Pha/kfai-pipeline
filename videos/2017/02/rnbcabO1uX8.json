How am I just seeing it now? Uh, you've seen it once before, I think. Really? Yeah. Really? It's a dope ass shirt. Yeah. They redesigned the Death Theater logo for that show and this is it. And it's Why did they do that? That seems like it goes along with the whole the uh art direction for the whole show.

That's what they get. I really like that. Thank you. What's going on with the Islanders? Are they moving away? Are they not? What's happening? I I was in Australia. I see. So, you put out a tweet or something. and they're moving away. The governor of Connecticut wrote a letter to the ownership saying that they can move there if they want to Hartford, the Wales to the Whaler to the Whalers uh hometown.

And after that, there the Islanders aren't even on the docket anymore. So assuming that there's some backend deal where they're going to leave. There's all sorts of things in play right now and I don't know what's going to happen. What happens if they go and become the Whalers again? They're not going to become if they go they're not but the last name twice in a lifetime. It's a weird kind of thing because if they move to Quebec or to Kansas City or something, I'm done with the NHL and I'm done with the Islanders.

But they have a they have a great tradition in that town for hockey and they're a miserable fan base too. So, it'd be funny to like move the Islanders there, have them become the Connecticut or the Hartford Islanders or something like that because, you know, Hartford's not that far from the water. And then, uh, we can combine the two miserable fan bases in the one. And we would get the brass bonanza, which is still the best goal song and we're going to hockey.

It'd be funny to get like they don't have any tradition there except for that song. So we could just take that song put a little Hartford patch on on the Islanders jerseys and then I remember when I busted that out one day and you're like wow how do you know that song? I don't know.

Great group of kids. This is uh the signing line that we did. Very healthy signing line. Autograph line one. Yeah. Mhm. These were just people that didn't make it into the signing, so they were just standing on the outside. I appreciate that. Quite the crowd. Good. There's our boy Pat. You might know him from being at this table back in the day. He came through back the old the old studio. I did the exact same thing where he came up and started talking to me and getting an autograph and I just totally it just did not register who he was cuz he's he looks different. His hair is different and he had a [\u00a0__\u00a0] up leg. So like he was talking with the can. I'm like what the hell? He was getting his uh fore honor on.

There's a full body shot somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. Pulled up. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, yeah. Like it [\u00a0__\u00a0] happened. That is amazing. It happens. People cosplayed as just keep doing it long enough. You know what I mean? That's all that really matters. Oh yeah, this guy right here in a Sean Finnegan likes hiking shirt. One of four sold. We got to bring that shirt back. Nobody bought back. Go forward. A freaking Q and five fan that I found out in Australia. Was a big big fan of that.

By the time you see this, we'll have tweeted it out a bunch of times. It's just running good. Is that it, Kev? Uh, no. Spitting out thing. Yeah, that's that's the end shot of our panel of everybody that was there. Amazing theater. Amazing crowd. Filled to the brim. Yeah, it was really cool. Any more pics? That was me me and Greg playing the Nintendo Switch. There's a game where you have to eat a sandwich and it got real intense. Yeah, it looks like you're eating [\u00a0__\u00a0] Yeah, it does.

Well, that's Greg after he beat me in some samurai. Now, what's important here? No, because this is what this is. This was basically this was one of the interstitials we did for the Rooster Teeth stream where they put us over at the Nintendo booth and we filled like five or six minutes or something. We played a bunch of different Switch games. The first one was one, two, Switch, the Samurai game. Wait, are you standing inside of a black guy's head? Correct. What the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is going on with this? I'm going to get to it. So, the first was the Samurai game in which after we got the hang of it, you challenged me for the kind of funny Nintendo World Championship. You beat me for it, which you've never done. You beat me to win the Nintendo World Championship. Then we went next door to the sandwich eating thing and I beat the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of there and I took I took the",

So that's me standing on top of one Nintendo speakers in there celebrating with the fans that had gathered watches outside. That was quite the experience. Now we're back to that. But okay, so the last thing I want to show uh for some for for you guys to see this is my favorite moment of the panel that wasn't Greg's intro. So Greg brought up some one of the kids and was just like, \"You think you know who Panda Musk is?\" And he started explaining who he thought Pandam Musk like he was like, \"I Panda Musk is from Australia. I've deduced this whatever. Figured it all out.\" And Greg's like, \"Do you think you could find Pandam Musk in the crowd?\" Now for those of you at home that don't know this, Pandamus, the guy that does all all of our art, the game over Greggy show intro.",

Yeah. Yeah. The painting and all that stuff. There it is. All that. But his identity is a secret. So he doesn't want to be known or whatever. So what we did is we wanted to see if Pan Musk would reveal himself in the crowd. Mhm. And this is what happened. Hold on. Okay. Before you play it. Uhhuh. For the audio so these guys can hear. I'm going to play on this as well. 40. I'm Panda Musk. I'm Panda Musk. It's like to tell the truth. Yeah. All right. No. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Let me just center this a little bit. Ready? Yeah.
