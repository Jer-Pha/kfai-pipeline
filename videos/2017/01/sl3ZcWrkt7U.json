This first topic, as you can tell from the headline, we're going to review Resident Evil 7. Uh it's been a lot of work this week. Everybody's been sick. Everybody's running around around doing stuff. I'm excited for the weekend. Oh, yeah. I'm worn down. Uh and I also just started an iPhone game I'm very stoked about that I want to talk about next week. A normal lost phone which is totally I'm I'm like literally I've been playing this thing for the 5 minutes leading up to this game cast cuz I just got my code for it and it is it's hitting all those chords of Emily was away.

I'm looking forward to it. I I might want to do a let's play of this. Okay, that could be fun. Do you have your little dongle here? Know how things go? Not with me now, but I'll know the whole mystery though. I don't want to do it today, but I want All right. Well, I'm sorry. Strike while the iron's hot. That's not the Tim Getty's motto.

Uh it's easier to do it at her apartment. So on Monday, I went over there and and I we got Resident Evil and and I put it in and started playing it and then the power all goes out and then comes back on and then the power this happens four times that night and I get about I have to like redo parts of the game over and over again. I'm like, I just keep playing. I'm like, maybe. So, the next day on Tuesday, people come over and they're like, um, the transformer is exposed outside and all this kind of stuff leading not a not a now you're a transformer.

Then on then they've turned back on at night. Then every day they're there. So, I really only had I guess what I'm saying is I had all these It's almost like the game's excellent, but almost like these bad omens of you're not meant to play this game. Like, like I try to play it on Monday, then I go home on Tuesday, I can't play it. Then on Wednesday, uh I have to edit Colin was right. And so we have like I can't play until the very end of the night. And then yesterday I stayed up till 3:00 in the morning playing as far as far through it as I could. And I thought it was like it was so [\u00a0__\u00a0] So how am I doing? I'm fine. But that was a frustrating situation. I was so excited. I thought we were going the opposite",

This is a way to do it. No, she's next to me pawing because there's a blanket and she wants to get under it. She just won't stop doing it until I lift it up so she can go. So it's a whole kind of thing of distract I just thought it was a it was a it was kind of an unfortunate time to get Resident Evil 7 considering the edit on Column was right and then this electrical problem everything combined and tried to dissuade me from playing it.

So, let's get right into it. Resident Evil 7, right? A review slash impressions. Sure, Greg. Yeah. Well, let's go this way. How did you play it? Sure. And how much of it did you play? Okay. Um, I played the first 4 and 1/2 hours of what it what my game clock says at the end, 10 hours of Resident Evil. I played the first four and a half in VR. Uh, I put up Instagram posts and Twitter stuff that I'd gone into the spare bedroom, the old studio, and set up the desk and put all the stuff there. So, it's just standing now that we can go in there and play VR games and not have it be a whole rigomear roll. Uh, set that up, played the first four and a half hours there. Really dug the VR experience. It, you know, I tal I talked about it coming uh at PSX coming out of the demo ride to our panel. The fact that I used it and I liked",

I'm enjoying this. This is great. And then it was that Wednesday came home from work. We had we booked out a half day to actually play this game to make sure we had time to get through it and everything. Uh came home and I wanted to be in PJs on the couch and it was it sucked because we had gotten it Monday. So I had done Monday night and I had done a little bit on Tuesday in VR and I liked it and I did enjoy the experience and want to keep going for it. But it did was that thing of just like I",

So I played the next six hours roughly that way. Uh throughout Wednesday and then throughout just just last night it was a similar situation to where Colin is right now in the game. No spoilers. Uh I was probably 30 minutes maybe even less ahead of where he is where he stopped right now. And then I was like ah I bet I'm really close to the end but I'm tired. I want to stop and this is on you know Wednesday night. And so then I came home last night and like yeah 15 minutes beat the game. I was like damn it. I hate it when you do that when you leave just at Morsel but it was like 12:30 and I'm like I got to do the morning show and everything else. I'm not going",

Man that's that was that was the thing that stopped me yesterday cuz I was up till almost 3 and I knew that I had to get up to do the morning show. So I didn't want to be like you know groggy and whatnot. Sure. So about half of it in VR, half of it PlayStation 4 normal. Yeah. Then you beat it. Yep. Beat. I've beaten it. Yeah. Yeah. Colin, uh, I am 7 hours. My clock says 7 hours and 40 minutes and it sounds like I'm less than a half an hour away from the end. So maybe I should have just kept going. Uh, I think the game I played it all standard. Uh, I had intended on playing it in VR. We were supposed to originally, or the rumor was we were supposed to get it on a Friday, and I was going to be home that entire weekend.

I'm just gonna uh give it a try later on in that and play it. That's why we got the room now. Thanks. Uh so uh uh so I played in the in the standard way. Um my first impressions of the game were not good. Uh and the more I played it, uh the more I really understood it and the more I I liked it. And I think that and I think that it's um you know, I think to get some of the bad out of the way, I don't I don't think the game's exceptionally pretty. Um in fact, I I thought the game really looked bad in the beginning. Um it seemed washed out. We were talking about this. I got I got some sort of intentional Resident Evil 4 vibes from the beginning of the game. I don't know",

Sure. Um for me it was that's where I started in VR and I don't want to spoil stuff. I think there's some restrictions there on what we they want us to talk about. But for me, when I jumped in, that was my first impression of like, [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah, playing VR started. And I was like, whoa. Oh no. Oh man, there's jaggies. And I looked down and like there was this weird thing where when you're looking out and you look down, there's like this mesh that of where it would be at your feet where they're clearly trying to make the shadows happen.",

I I know what you're talking about in terms of like it doesn't look amazing. But yeah, I in terms of graphics, I thought the environments look and I agree with the beginning of game was a little weird and there's a reason for that that you'll see as you play it. But uh when you're in the house, I think that I think the environments are really good-looking and I think that the especially because the vignette that's constantly going on where you only are seeing part of the screen, I feel like it really draws your eyes to the environment and it doesn't look as good as something like say PT, but I think that's because that was just a",

Yeah. Yeah. I think that you know some of these minor complaints aside I think the things that the game nails and why I think it's a really great game is um I think the pacing is really good. Uh and and pacing is is not always important in video games. I think it's an overused and overall kind of term. Uh, I think it's important in certain games. I think it's important uh specifically in shooter campaigns. And I think it's important in some other genres. And I think it's",

And I think it's important in some other genres. And I think it's very important in survival horror games. And that's pacing is the and pacing and backtracking and and all that is the reason why Dead Space is one of the great uh um games of all time. And why I think that Resident Evil, even the original one, um, and Director's Cut and remake and all that kind of stuff was so good because it it paced well and it brought you back to places you had been and and changes them slightly and increases enemy encounters or anything like that, which I think is really good and I think Resident Evil 7 really nails that specific part of it. Um, I think the story is kind of nonsense uh and muddled and I I was a little disappointed in it, but it didn't ruin the game for me. It actually doesn't ruin the game for me at all in the sense that um it really is the the ambience",

It actually doesn't ruin the game for me at all in the sense that um it really is the the ambience and the environmental storytelling that I think is important in these kinds of games. And I think that this game does that very well. I agree with you. Once you're inside the various houses, and I'm not going to I won't get into into the into the weeds of where you are. you're basically in Louisiana uh in the bayou and and um so you're you're exploring different locations there and uh I think that they do a nice job of making a very ominous and very scary uh situation come to life even apart from the story like like the story is actually kind of secondary to me to to the way the the way of just because there's something to be said like when we play a game like the Witcher 3 I'm not playing the Witcher 3 being like wow I wish I was Geralt running around slashing you know demons or when I",

And while that's not possible, it's a little more connected to an every like not an everyday experience, but a real experience where it's like I'm in this room and I'm looking for ammo and I'm in this I'm in this place and I'm looking for this or whatever. I like that the way that they execute on that. And I think my overall impression of the game is that Resident Evil 7 is a step back in the right direction. I don't think it's anywhere near as good as Resident Evil 4. I don't think it's where it needs to be, but I think that they are getting back to where they need to be. And I I'm confident that this game will do well, this game will resonate,",

And so I I applaud Capcom because I think this wasn't probably easy or intuitive them for them. I think that with five and especially with six, they thought they were doing the right thing and and people were like, \"You're actually doing the wrong thing.\" And here are some examples of people doing the right thing. whether people really love Soma, people really love Outlast and people love, you know, PT and all these kinds of things and and and so I I think that there's a lot of positive stuff to be taken out of there.

But I think overall it is a game absolutely worth playing and experiencing. 100%. And I think you nailed part that I think we were all talking about because we all started that first night together was the fact of when you start it, it is jarring in a in a sense, right? And not only that, it's the fact that it seems like it's going to be super easy. And I and I do think the game with the exception of one boss fight that stalled me and I think that's where my game clock ticked up a lot is that I was like, \"What the [\u00a0__\u00a0] am I doing wrong in this boss fight?\" Uh, outside of that, it was like, \"All right, cool. You need this thing needs a fuse.\" and you go upstairs, you",

You need this thing needs a fuse.\" and you go upstairs, you found a fuse and you go put it in and like like there was like things that that were that simple and that quick to figure out and then you start getting introduced to all right now there's a snake door and a scorpion door and you don't know how you're going to find those keys. You're eventually going to find those keys, but you have to worry about it now. And you go through and the your world slowly gets bigger and bigger and bigger to play in. And then it becomes more, well, [\u00a0__\u00a0] how am I going to double back to that? Oh, and remember that. And you start finding like the photos that are like the treasure treasure, you know, where you come back here and you find that or next time you see this kind of baby's head up there, you know, to look up there and it'll trigger you have a treasure",

Yeah, exactly. I I agree with you in that in the early game, it's very very very simple stuff where it's like, here's a key, go right upstairs and do it. But it is once you start seeing all the different doors uh that you're like, \"All right, cool. I need to start thinking more uh with backtracking in mind.\" And it reminds me of things like Super Metroid and you know the Metroid Vania style games where I'm like, \"All right, cool.\" And it reminded me of what I liked about old Resident Evil games. Uh cuz even in the other ones, the puzzles were never too crazy. I feel like in one through three there they had more advanced stuff, but in Resident Evil 4, there's only one or two real like, \"All right, I need to stop here and think about this puzzle. Otherwise, it is pretty much",

So, I think that this one did a good job in terms of puzzles of never making you feel like you're you're stupid. Uh but but in the beginning, it was a little bit like, all right, here's a blue key. It goes in this blue hole and you and you think that that's what it's going to be. Not to mention the fact that the game is about exploring the environments and picking up pictures and reading diaries. And it's almost jarring in the way that when you first start that game and you start to going through those early environments, it is I mean there's a giant X over everything you can interact with. So you come in, you immediately know there's three things in this room I can interact with. I'm clearly",

Definitely Resident Evil, but at the same time, it is a greatest hits of the last three years of horror games. Sure. Um and I don't think that that's a bad thing.

You know, it's tricks and whatever, but when you are on, you're creeping around trying to be found and you hear them, they're talking, they're calling out to Ethan and all this different stuff, it did make me like goosebump, you know what I mean?

I feel like pretty quickly uh the game goes from being super scary to oh I understand the rules of this like this house can't scare me anymore which is a good thing I think cuz you do kind of not only as a character become more powerful but as a person you're like you know you're not going to get me like I know I'm safe walking through this door.

And same thing with gunplay where I like I mean, shout out. I think I think for sure gunplay in VR feels better than it does in that cuz it was all of a sudden of just like, you know, it's the same thing as always pull with L2 to bring it up and then R2 to fire, but then you're aiming with where you look and the hands out in front of you doing this or whatever. And so like the first fight you have with somebody where you shoot them and you have a gun or whatever and it was like boom. And I was like, what? How do Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] Oh my.

I save them up so I can buy a magnum pistol, for instance. Um the uh which I think was pretty cool. You find backpacks uh that give you more storage space, slots.

And I literally said I was playing last night, used the key to get through a door and she's just there and I'm like, \"Oh, why are you here?\" Like like what are you doing here?

And it was it's super immersive and it's a I think really cool way to tell that the story and like not have it just be a cut scene, but actually have you be able to play these really cool moments and have it make sense narratively where it's not you could be in the exact same location, but you're learning something that you're going to",
