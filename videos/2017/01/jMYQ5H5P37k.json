So on the Kind of Funny Morning Show at some point we were discussing this, because I don't remember how it came up. Yeah. You were internet exploring as you two do. Yes, absolutely was. You queued up a, yeah, video. We found the rad anthem by a musical artist called Rad Omen. If you haven't seen this before, stop what you're doing and you can do it right now.

A lot of cocaine. It's very graphic, very ridiculous, a lot of butts in this video. So it kind of sparked a thought in my mind of who is the best fast food mascot? Who deserves a shout out? And who are the ones that we don't think about? Does the bell from Taco Bell count? No, but the Chihuahua does. The Chihuahua does. Ooh, Joe Carrero. So what I did, I found a list online of the best fast food mascots. And I want to kind of go through that as a starting point so we can see what we think about all of these.

So everybody knows Poe, my best friend from back in Chicago. The deal was that the sponge monkeys, the Quizno Sub fucking motherfuckers, who eat Quizno Subs with those damn commercials. They came around, and this happened in college times. And Poe hated this commercial so much that he infamously swore off ever going into a Quizno Sub again. And they'd be having a party, and the fucking commercial would come on. He would run over and turn off the TV. He would yank the power cord out of the wall. He didn't want to hear these fucking sponge monkeys for one goddamn second. And to Poe, I mean, to his credit, he legitimately full on",

I'm going to wait outside. And she's like, well, why don't you just come in, and if you're not going to eat? And he's like, no, this whole thing with this commercial, I won't go into Quizno Sub anymore. And she's like, really? And he's like, yeah. And he just stood outside in the cold while she went in to get this thing. And he calls out the fact that more people are on his side because Quiznos did tank afterwards.

I mean, they made it relevant the fact you all talked about hating it. But I mean, I guess that's the thing of any publicity, not bad publicity. It bothered me that he's playing guitar left handed too. Well, I mean, also, why would you use these things that look like rats? They look like fucked up rats. They got mutated. And they're eating at Quizno Subs. They're going inside Quiznos? I don't want to eat where these things are. It was like the birth of internet culture at that time.

You saw people dressed up. I never saw a suburban Chicago McDonald's. He was out there waving you in sometimes to go in the drive through and all this shit. And he was just cuddly. You were having acid flashbacks because he was soft. He was cute. He was big and slow like me. There was a lot for me to like. He is here.

And that's the and that you see Grimace is too vanilla because he comes from a time. You telling me that that thing ain't horrifying? No, that thing comes from a design boardroom in the 60s where they're like, what can we how can we make the simplest suit? Sure.

Grimace, a large purple is from Wikipedia, a large purple monster like character who was first introduced in November 1971 as evil Grimace. In Grimace's first three appearances, he was depicted with two pairs of arms in which to steal milkshakes. Evil was soon dropped from Grimace's name and Grimace was reintroduced in 1972 as one of the good guys. There you go. That's well, his name is Grimace. I never really thought about that. Like it's an interesting kind of, oh, to that, to that origin story. See, I don't have rulers to do too, but, but what, I mean like McDonald's had actually a lot of interest.

He was a good slide. You could climb up in his thing. It's a group image. I, first of all, I never voted for Mayor McCheese in this, in this race. But second of all, I, when I was seven or eight years old, when I was not even, when I realized what was going on in that ball pit, I'm like, I can't never go in this thing.

That's the professor. A bearded scientist. He was introduced in 1971 and served as McDonald's local inventor and researcher. In the 1970s, he was a minor character who rarely spoke. Around the 1980s, the professor was a major character and he was redesigned to include a light bulb topped helmet and a mustache with his hair changing from brown to white. Birdie, I did.

Tim Curry really nailed him in that Stephen King movie. Just look at him. Look at it. You wanna see that walking into McDonald's? That thing used to horrify me.

So I kicked out hard and when I popped my head above, and this is when I'm like five or six years old, I popped my head above the bubbles to see what's going on and I just fucked this kid up.

We're gonna put cheese in our crust, but put pepperoni in it as well. And then people love Crazy Bread. Let's put cheese in that and pepperoni in that. And I will never forget being so excited and eating that stuff, and being old enough to know, this is bad. I probably shouldn't eat this each week, or at least my parents should make me exercise. But I didn't stop, and I just kept going. Here we are today. Yep. It all makes sense. It turned out okay. Keep going Kev. So next up we got Ronald McDonald. We can skip him. Yeah, please get it off the screen. There we go. The king. The king. The king was great. The king made a comeback, man. He used to be this little punk ass motherfucker, and then he came out and he's like, I'm creepy as hell. They doubled down on the McDonald's thing. They're like, we get it. He's creepy.

There was, because remember they had the crowns. I'm not saying the crowns didn't exist. I'm just saying, I don't remember there being a visual representation of Burger King. There was a king, a little cartoon king, but I don't give a fuck about him. I don't feel like Burger King gets its proper- No. Its proper kind of praise. Burger King is the patsy of fast foods. Burger King is really actually very good. This is what we were talking about last week. Depending on what you eat. When you came in, burgers- They're way better at Burger King. Burger King, better than McDonald's. You guys are so crazy. Check true. The fries, the fries are-",

The Whopper doesn't suck. All those fancy burgers are fancy. The Whopper is really, really fantastic if it's made properly. And that's a really important thing because there's so many toppings on it they're going to be made very frivolously and very poorly and then fall apart. Here's a suggestion. Just get the double or triple. Get a lot of cheese on there. Keeps it all together. Makes it nice construction. Keep the paper around it. Eat it like that. I used to love Burger King.

Nobody knows what happened to Burger King. One day it was just gone. But God, I spent thousands of dollars in that place probably. You know, because at probably every college they put money, you can put money on this card. Yep. We did that, yeah. And so at the beginning of every semester you just had what we used to call free money. Yeah. Especially remote, you used to call free money. We just used to go spend at Burger King.

I feel like in the world there's McDonald's people and then there's Burger King people. I feel like all the rest of them are kind of just extra shit that's like, oh, I like McDonald's, but I also like Jack in the Box. I think part of this comes down to my aversion to onions and the fact that McDonald's around by default and Burger King's aren't.

Let me tell you a quick story, quick anecdote. Went to Jake Steaks yesterday in the Marina, which is a cheese steak place. Oh, okay. Pretty good. Saw on the back display case, a smorgasbord of drinks, soft drinks. They had Coke and they had Pepsi. You ordered the Pepsi? One with the Pepsi. Nice, guys. Nice job. Where's the Pepsi? One with the Pepsi last time. Let me go tit for tat with that. I joined the Burger King Kids Club growing up. All right, so we're getting there. So just to go through this real quick, Long John Silver, I don't even know who the fuck that guy is. Long John Silver is a seafood restaurant. No, I know that, but who's the mascot?

We go there, you have some hush puppies. He's skinny, so he's doing something right. We call him the camel. Wendy's, whatever. Well, I like briefly when they brought out the real Wendy and started after Dave Thomas died. Yeah, Dave Thomas was the homie, dude. But yeah, they brought his daughter out, everyone here. Then they brought out the hot bread head. Now I call him to some... Who I always meant to do when I was still doing Gregways back in the day, so this is a deep cut.

I started trying to gather footage because I wanted to do a Gregway about her fall from grace. Because she went from being a magical creature who popped into your car when you're thinking about Wendy's and took you to Wendy's. And then she just started working boring office jobs where she's just like, oh, guys, you want to go to Wendy's today, guys? I'm eating a salad. Like, weren't you like a fucking angel or a pixie or something? Now you got no magic. I don't remember any of this. That's crazy. So last on the list is the colonel. They're fucking the colonel up right now. What is up with this? Shout out to the colonel generally, but not what they're doing now. This rotating cast of colonels? It was Norm Macdonald for a minute.

Just make it, just make, just make, or don't even do this at all. Daryl Hammond needs the work. Just let him be the colonel for God's sake. He's waiting for Bill Clinton to do something. God, you know, he's like, fuck, why couldn't Hillary have won? God, I would have somebody to guess their appearance. So to close out this topic, we've been talking a lot about most of these mascots were created in the 70s, right?

I had a pen pal through it, which is so weird to think about that I mailed him to Burger King, and they're like, all right, here's some other random kid's address. Enjoy talking to him.

It was after he discovered electricity. He didn't discover electricity, but it was after he discovered it. Well, he got zapped by the lightning bolt in his kite. Well, he figured out that lightning was electricity. Fried off the top of his hair and he would have started wearing the coonskin cap. Right, well that's- Then he went back in time. He's very fat.
