    "description": "Welcome to Kinda Funny Year 3! Community is our focus in 2017, and we've heard that you want the Kinda Funny Morning Show (formerly Colin & Greg Live) on YouTube and as a podcast. So, that's what we're doing. \n\nThe Kinda Funny Morning Show will still be live on http://www.Twitch.com/kindafunnygames Monday through Friday, but from now on, the KFMS will also post here on YouTube, and eventually, it'll pop as a daily podcast. We're still troubleshooting the podcast process and expect to have it working in the coming weeks/months.\n\nCommunication is important to us, so understand that this is a whole new world for us. We're figuring it out as we go. There's a good chance that episodes of the KFMS will be muted, taken down, and so on. We're experimenting with this on the fly and learning as we go. \n\nSo, let's try something new together!\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunny\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nColin - http://www.twitter.com/NoTaxation\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller, Colin Moriarty, Tim Gettys, and Nick Scarpino talk about the biggest stories in nerd culture.",
