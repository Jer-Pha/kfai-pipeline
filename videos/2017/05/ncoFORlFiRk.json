So E3 comes and goes. However, as usual, I'm out working and you chuckleheads are out partying. So the next day, Nick Scarpino wanders in and talks about how he ran into Jen last night and this crazy thing happened to her where a naked man busted into her her hotel room. That's right. The Lion Hotel. I love them. Great rooms, amazing restaurant. Um That's right. Cuz we were staying in the same hotel. That's right.",

Cuz we were staying in the same hotel. That's right. Yeah. and we ran into each other in the lobby. Um, and I was probably very pale. You were a bit flustered. Um, so I was a very naive hotel room user in which I never put the dead bolt on my door at any given time. So you guys, but you had one of those adjoining rooms, right? Oh, no. It was just legitimately your [\u00a0__\u00a0] room. The door just doesn't go all the way in. It's one of those you ever walk into a hotel room and let the door slam behind you, but it doesn't actually slam. It just rests. That's what happened here was happening. So on Tuesday night, I was on the bomb cast and then there was a square party which I didn't go to cuz I was starting uh game interviews the next day for Day Sex Go and I wanted to be rested cuz I knew like for people who don't know how interview rooms go,",

It's terrible. Back to back to back to back. So, I wanted to be in shape and awake, so I didn't drink and I went to bed at midnightish. And um long story short, at 5:00 a.m. I woke up to the resounding sound of somebody urinating and I'm like, man, the walls are so thin in here. But that guy sounds like he's in literally my room. And then I sit up in my bed and it's super dark and I turn around and the bathroom light is on. And then I start waking up for real. Like the aineline kicks in.

There is like the door, the bathroom, the bed, and the Yeah, there's nothing. There's no like jut. There's nothing separating. So, I grab a couple clothing items and I cover myself up and I back myself up against the window and I wait for the guy to finish peeing cuz I'm like, well, thank you.
