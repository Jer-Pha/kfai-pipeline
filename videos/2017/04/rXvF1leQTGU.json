These [\u00a0__\u00a0] companies, Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, they each have varying versions of the same type of thing when it comes to to talking to the audience. Nowadays, everyone has YouTube channels. They're can put up their own trailers whenever they want. like PlayStation's channel's like pretty legit like they they release stuff constantly. Um Nintendo has its directs. Xbox has Xbox Wire and um Nelson just like killing it with all all that type of stuff and making it more personality driven while still getting the the information out there. But with the amount of conventions there are where there's E3 being the kind of main one and then there's the still the Paris Games weeks, the Gamescoms, the TGS's and all of that, there's pretty much every month something happening.

I mean it depends on the announcement I think. Right. That's the big thing. I I I mean to take PlayStation example I love the fact that there's PSX because PSX is hey I want to talk to the people who listen to PS I love you every week.

You know what I mean? Like, they have a great balance to it. I don't think they nail it all the time. You know what I mean? The PlayStation blog's great, but I I love the idea of Major Nelson. And if I I don't and I mean I know Major Nelson, but if I I think maybe was more of an Xbox guy, you know, for the last 10 years, I would know more. I would love to see them take the reins off of Sid and Ryan and all of them and let them be personalities. I would love it if they were on the YouTube channel and if you went to the PlayStation and it was Yeah, exactly. It was them chilling out.

I mean, I that I kind of like that though. I like that. Uh, not that they aren't allowed to really have their personalities out there, but I like that the PlayStation blog is uh a place to kind of get all of the information about games. Like when the Crash Bandicoot uh trilogy was actually announced or whatever, like I went to the PlayStation site and it had everything. It had more information than I even got from like Activision's press release and it's just like cuz they they dived hardcore. They're hardcore and it goes into the like, yeah, they're totally remastering the soundtrack and it's going to be this, this, and that. The PR thing didn't say anything about that.

Sure. Yeah. I think it's interesting how we've really shifted from, you know, these big brands always releasing their biggest stuff at E3 on stage at a press conference to now in these two months leading up to E3, we're probably going to get most of the big announcements before E3 even gets here, Destiny 2. I mean, I think we're going to hear about, you know, Scorpio before E3. we probably won't see it until we get to the stage.

And, you know, they are kind of marching to the beat of their own drum at E3, too. And even companies like Bethesda that are putting out their stuff. I mean, I didn't expect to see that extensive scene we saw from The Lost Legacy um until E3. and Naughty Dog's just like, \"Here's a cool trailer, you know, get your pre-orders in now.\" Um, and so I think it's for people like us that, you know, make a living off of speculating on what's going to happen is really kind of throwing a wrench into the whole situation going, \"Well, when is Xbox going to going to tell us what their next big first party game is?

Are they going to respond to Scorpio? When is that announcement going to happen? It's It's been interesting looking at how YouTube specifically has kind of changed the way that these publishers make their big announcements because before they would go to like your IGN, your EGMs, your, you know, Eurogamers of the world and Exactly. or your Game Informer exclusive reveal. And now we're seeing less and less of that because well, first off, leaks are everywhere and if they have their own channel, why not just release it there?

Like they I don't think they would have shown that scene from Uncharted at E3, you know, be like it was kind of weird just being a random snippet of the story, right? But because it was just the whole post was about Uncharted, they're allowed to kind of do their own thing and then just be graded and like judged and commented on based on, oh, this is just about Uncharted's release date.

I love them because it's just randomly once a month, maybe once every two months, there's just going to be Nintendo news.

If we're going to announce a whole bunch of [\u00a0__\u00a0] over this hour, they've kind of turned into, all right, this is a direct about Smash Bros., this is a direct about Mario Kart.

Games, games, games, games, games games. And the problem with it is it was a great direct. Announced like 20 games coming to the Switch or 3DS. Gave uh real in-depth look at Splatoon 2 and at ARMS. Gave release dates for those. It answered a lot of questions that people had um about upcoming Switch titles that are coming very soon, like pre3. But then of course the reaction to it is like they didn't [\u00a0__\u00a0] why they even [\u00a0__\u00a0] do this.

Like I I mean I'm a student of the game. I've paid attention. I know what directs are and you talk about them all the time. But I think that Switch has brought in so many people and so many sleeper people who didn't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about Wii U. They didn't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about DirectX. They didn't care that now you're there. it is. You're thinking it's going to be a PlayStation announcement thing. It's going to be some kind of thing.

Give me some weirdass Nintendo [\u00a0__\u00a0] I don't think that people who would maybe be considered a casual Nintendo fan if they, you know, skipped the last version of Wii and they just got back into Switch because of of Zelda that do they really care about what Nintendo was talking about in their directs anyway? I mean, are they even bothering to to watch or read those headlines? I mean, if you're if you just bought a Switch, I think you are, right? Because you're like, man, I want to play more things on this. What am I going to play on it?

I think the people watching the direct are just the like not casual game fans, the hardcore game fans that are like people that listen to podcasts and you know kind of indulge in all that stuff. And what I was saying, like the point that I was trying to make is it's interesting to look at Nintendo Direct versus the Uncharted Lost Legacy reveal where both are we're just doing one thing like that was for Uncharted whereas this was for ARMS and Splatoon, but because it was under the Nintendo Direct banner, it people didn't receive it the same way. They got angry that they didn't get Metroid, you know, even though all it was was just an info dump. It was a PlayStation blog post about those two games, right? Um and as a fan, I I enjoy that we did get a lot more than I expected. I thought it was just going to be those two games. But then the other side of that is it was a bunch of stuff",

But I I don't I enjoy that they at least put that information out there and that they announced those games and do kind of celebrate them in a way. Otherwise like I wouldn't know about a lot of the like the Kirby games coming out or whatever the the Hey Pikmin 3DS platform. So you like the direct or would you prefer a more flashy kind of announcement? See no I I think that the the direct I think what they did with the Nintendo presentation, the Nindy's thing last month, which wasn't a direct but essentially was, was brilliant because they took out the direct name, so people didn't go into it expecting a press conference and they got just 15 looks at games coming to the Nintendo Switch and then a screenshot of 60 logos of and",

You're saying you're saying to the wider gamer audience direct means Fire Emblem in Smash and we're going to get a big big thing. Yeah. And so I just think that had they just called this something different. Had they just called this Arms and Splatoon presentation, I think people would have not disliked it to hell and and and all that, right?

I wonder how much longer PlayStation can continue to be successful like this because the thing is PlayStation came out and knocked it out of the park with that PlayStation 4 event. Here's the games. Here's what we're doing. Here's you know the E3. Here's a funny video with Adam and Shu about how to share. They were I'm like, \"You guys are on another [\u00a0__\u00a0] level. You are insanely",

And here are the AAA games. And then we get to PSX and PSX is normal where it should be. And I think that's the balance. That's the sweet and the sour.

But I do feel like Xbox and that team really is setting up these dominoes. And I don't know if they'll ever fall because PlayStation's so far ahead with PS4.

But if PlayStation does continue to it seems like they're going back to being quieter where it seems like I'm seeing more from Phil Spencer now like you know his post today about the Scorpio just hey all of a sudden here I am in Xbox Wire all this information about Scorpio we'll see 83 when we show it and you're like oh we'll Scorpio will be 83 like okay great that's cool and to see them getting out in front of it it's just interesting. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. The the last thing I want to say about Nintendo is I I think the solution because I I was pitching about the problem, but I do think the solution is focusing more on directs about specific games and they this could have been two directs or even just one direct that is very clearly called Splatoon in arms and keep Nintendo Direct as a thing that people expect it to be. If you're going to announce the Metroid and you're going to announce the big games and it's more of like a press",

If you're going to announce the Metroid and you're going to announce the big games and it's more of like a press conference, come out with that. Otherwise, the people are going to be upset about Splatoon because they didn't want to like it anyways, even though Splatoon is a hit and people buy it, you know, and more people are going to buy Splatoon 2. Like, I bet Splatoon 2 outs sells Splatoon one. Oh my god. Yeah, it'll take it'll be it lifetime. But the thing is Splatoon 1 sold super well for a Wii U game, but even at 5 million, like almost 5 million, like that's I had no idea it sold that many. Yeah. The people who love Splatoon love. That's the thing. Splatoon 1 on Wii U is like a 4.7 or something like that. Last I checked. I'm sorry. What's up everybody? Welcome to the Kind of Funny Morning Show for April 13th.

BLC doesn't even know what's happening back there anymore. Oops. But I I love you, Kevin. I think that like Nintendo does a bad job of telling people that didn't know it sold that well that it did. You know, like like people they just kind of expect that like, oh yeah, it's Splatoon. What's happening? People like that. Kevin's fixing everything. Don't worry, Kevin's on it. That's how it happens sometimes. Garbage truck on fire. But ARMS is another example is when you see ARMS next to like in a in a press conference, like when they revealed it for the first time, it's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] joke and people are like, \"What the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is this [\u00a0__\u00a0] I want Metroid.\" You know, but ARMS could be a hit and it could be another Nintendo character-driven IP that people really like like Splatoon if they play their cards right.

Why are you shaking your head? It's not gonna be a hit. That's what everyone said about Splatoon and 5 million on the Wii U, which only sold 13 million is pretty good. I know, right? ARM ain't going to do it. I mean, even looking at PS4 game sales, like what's the top selling PS4 game? Uncharted, which is that like 8 million digital or retail? Overall, uh, in we're talking about exclusive. Are you talking about first? I mean, can it be a third party? Doesn't matter either way. Because it would be probably Call of Duty then, wouldn't it? Yeah, I think so, right? Yeah. Um, yeah. I don't know if it's an exclusive. Exclusive would be Uncharted. Nothing got sold more than 8 million. What's Oh, Horizon's off to like a crazy start, though.

I wasn't make the real argument. See if I could look it up really quick. Andrew Rene going to look up what's the bestselling PlayStation 4 game. Oh, dang it. If Colin Morardi was here, he would say it immediately, but he wouldn't really know. He would say it and we would all be like, \"Oh, it must be right.\" Yeah, that's true. And I want to I want to also want to make sure that Splatoon sold as much as I You can check that, too. I'll talk to the audience and saying, \"Hey, everybody, it's me, Greg. How you doing?\" I don't say anything that involves numbers, so I don't have to check them or do math. If I had another dart right now, I'd call Andy and shoot at his face.",

So, this is a very dangerous toy, and that's why it's in the knockoff. Uncharted 4: Thief's End sold 8.7 million copies, followed by Horizon Zero Dawn at 2.6, followed by Killzone, Shadow Fall. So, we're talking about exclusives or we're talking about like just games in general. Those are just exclusives. Okay. Which granted, there's a lot of third party games that sell super well. Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, like all it does. GTA might be the highest selling. I don't know. GTA 5 is the highest selling uh game of all time. All SKs are. Yeah, you imagine. Yeah. Yeah, it was. Doesn't matter which. Always on top. Yeah. Okay. Well, there you go. What do you got for Splatoon?",

A couple months and Splatoon was out for years. The only the thing you're what you're talking about here is the interesting part of I think Splatoon is going to sell incredibly well at launch because more people are excited about their Switches than they were their Wii. But the problem is yeah, lifetime. how many Wii Us were in the install base, you know, but there's not five million Wii or Switches out there for people to buy the [\u00a0__\u00a0] game on. Yeah. So, that's why the lifetime thing once there's bundles. But even like first week sales and stuff like that would be interesting to see, I think. Yeah. Yeah. And for ARMS as well, and AMS comes first.

That's I just thought it'd be funny, but ARMS isn't going to sell. Let me know in the comments below if you're excited for ARMS. It ain't about that. It's about I'm saying it could be a hit. I in the same way that Splatoon was because everyone had the same reaction to Splatoon that they do to ARMS. No, I disagree. What? Yeah. I think more people were outward about how much they loved Splatoon than they have been about ARMS. You're talking about after it came out.

Yeah, exactly. I'm not saying ARMS is a bad game. Yeah. And I'm not even saying is a good game.
