I am your only host, Greg Miller, alongside no one cuz I said only, but I am a robot and so I say things in a certain order and they just come out regardless. It's been my pleasure to serve you. Uh, if you've never caught a kind of funny AMA or a kind of funny games AMA, the idea is simple. over on patreon.com/kindfunny or patreon.com/kindfunnygames. We put up a post saying, \"Hey patrons, give us your Q's and then we will put up your A's over on youtube.com/kindfunny or kind of funny games.\" Of course, this is the kind of funny Q&A. So, it's over here on kind of funny. You get the idea, right? Non-game questions over here, game questions over there. That's what we do. Let's get into it. I think we have 25 according to patreon.com/kindfunny. First up, and by the way, I have not read these in advance, so if I have to stumble around or look for something on the internet, so be it.

So [\u00a0__\u00a0] be it. Patrick Kanan. Hey, Greg. My friend and I just started a podcast a few weeks ago called the Friendly Neighborhood Podcast. Any advice for two guys starting out who have never done this before? Sure, Patrick. Of course, there's topics about this up on youtube.com/confoney. You go to kind of funny.com as well. Get everything there. Um, Bernie Burns from Rooster Teeth and I did a Gregway a long time ago about how to podcast. Uh, there's a whole bunch of stuff up there. Uh, it kind of plays into my whole thing too of like uh how to get into video game journalism. There's a Greg about that as well. But in general, consistency uh what I think people take for granted with podcasts is that it's a muscle. And I know that sounds stupid because many of you have real muscles.

But the idea of being able to talk, take a breath, not worry about taking a breath into the mic, know how to pass the thought to somebody else, have this conversation flow together, have it be jumping around doing these things cuz like people always talk about me talking too fast. For me, micro pauses, like when I'm like, \"What do you think, Tim?\" Or like when we finish a topic and it's just like there's that everyone takes a breath. I hate that. I hate that silence because I want the show to flow for everybody else. And everybody I think for the most part and you're watching this, you must think we have some kind of flow going that it goes well. So it's you got to get out there and do it.

Do you pick a day or two or whatever you're doing for your podcast, make sure you hit that time every [\u00a0__\u00a0] day. Similar to like when PS I Love You, right? 9:00 am every day.

Cassidy Coyote, would you rather be clairvoyant with no memory or have a perfect memory with absolutely no foresight?

I mean, he's been doing it for a while, I know, but like it's cool to hear his voice. I miss him, too, by the way.

Have a great day. Okay. Well, there's there's a lot to unpack there. Let's go. Let's think about this. Now, my favorite dish to cook, obviously, I cook wings once a week. I love that. That's my signature dish. The problem I have is that, well, the problem, I guess. I like to cook the wings, but it's now second nature. I know how to do it in my sleep. You know what I mean?

He's going south to Santa Monica and I'm Carazorel and I'm just moving, you know, in a different San Francisco place. But I guess I'm not getting stuck in like a time warp. You know what I mean? The house didn't literally explode. Anyways, the chicken thigh chariza dish was really good and it came this one I used the giant cast iron for you.

I've only cooked it once. I need to cook it again. I want to cook it for Big Kev Dog. What? Yeah, you'd love this dish. The problem is I got to make [\u00a0__\u00a0] something for Paula then.

So, one of my favorite stories of writing back in Missouri, oh man, I feel like all my Columbia Daily Tribune stories, cuz that's where I worked after college when I got my journalism degree, are now super sad, bittersweet ones, cuz I think about my favorite stories all revolve around this editor named George who work I worked the night shift. Uh I worked so I worked Tuesday through Saturdays and I worked Friday and Saturday nights and so I was general assignment. So Tuesday through Thursday, I came in at normal hours and whatever people needed me to pick up, I picked up.

It was me and one other reporter that [\u00a0__\u00a0] swung in every whatever it was, seven weeks, eight weeks, depending on how many reporters they were. Every took a week, you know, and that meant I covered everything.

My phone was going off with a ringtone for Po, my best friend. Po is calling me during a hostage standoff. Now, I'll stop I'll stop the story. What? Oh, so eventually they order the people off the bus. All these people come off, hands over their heads, machine guns drawn, and they get the bus driver out.

I would want to do it probably on a game over Greggy show though. Is that okay? Because I want that to be a topic eventually. I want it to be a topic, Kev. I want to have her on and we do a topic about it. What's so wrong with that? People want to know the people they I understand, but I want to make it a topic with her one day. Is it okay, Kevin? Kevin, no. You're supposed to support me. It's a very sweet story, but I want it to be I want it to be a topic. Was I involved? You were. You're You're in the story. You know that.

All right, there's a good chance she'll wise up. Wait, I can do better. John BX32. Hey, Greg, do you guys have any more plans for the studio? I just watched the kind of funny live 2 reveal video and forgot about the back room, studio B. Do you think you'll ever do you think you'll end up doing anything with that space? Congrats on Jen and the new apartment. Well, John Bx32. Yeah, we uh if you remember that kind of funny live 2 video when we walked through this place and it's completely empty. We had a whole bunch of different plans for this than what ended up happening. Uh so yeah, in the back there's offices on that up there on that side of the wall.",

Uh so yeah, in the back there's offices on that up there on that side of the wall. Then there's the bathroom here, hallway, kitchen right behind us, and then that back corner is another space we were calling studio B. The original idea was this would be the podcast sets and back there we would have like the morning show area or whatever where we could Twitch stream and all that jazz. Uh once we built the set in here, we were like, \"This is too [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome. We should do everything here. Why would we go away from the the awesome set to go back there and do this stuff?\" So we did that and then when we hired Andy, when we brought Joey on parttime, but when she's in the office and stuff, it became pretty clear we need more desks. So what's happened is Studio B is actually now where the founders sit, where me, Tim, and Nick are in the back there. Then up here, Kevin is",

Then he's got Andy out in front of him and e extra desks and then uh the couch now for guests when they come over and stuff. So this is the studio and then we use all that back there. There's a VR room Kevin built in the back for a let's play we're supposed to do that I asked him very nicely to put on the calendar about a month and a half ago. Oh man, it's just we've been so busy. Have we? Yeah. Have we? I mean hey also the Star Trek uh let's play. Are you editing that? I see you tinkering with it all the time. No, no, I was prepping it to give to Andy. It has been prepped.

I saw your little outburst on Twitch after you watched the second half of my video. Did I get inside the almighty Greg Miller's head? You bet your ass I did. I actually, if you haven't been following, we're doing this Mario Kart thing tomorrow, which will actually be in the past for you, where I'm playing Mario Kart and I'm playing Ziger and I'm playing average and I'm playing like 190 other best friends.

I was on the ask kind of funny anything last month and you watched my backyard wrestling company KBW Wrestling. Are you finally connecting the dots and realizing who I am? Last month I proposed to have a promo battle with you at Kind of Funny Live 3 and you said that you will remember this after you witnessed my promo skills firsthand on the morning show. You know now, no, you now know that I'm more capable to hang more than capable to hang with you. I have to admit your comeback was great, but just imagine how great it would be if we went face to face. I don't know about you, but I feel like all the best friends would be into it.
