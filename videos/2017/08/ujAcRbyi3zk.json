But the it sounds so stupid, but the ability to be like, \"Hey, Andy, can you make me this graphic for this event? Hey, Joey, I think it'd be cool if you told everybody this. Hey, cool. Greg, can you go do this?\" And it's done. And it is that thing of like it's done, right? It's done. It's done right. And I And it's like the simplest things that literally, yeah, they take 5 minutes, they take 10 minutes to do yourself, but out of a packed day, like to be able to have that extra moment of being able like, \"No, I need to eat lunch now.\" You know what I mean? I come off today and you're like, \"Hey, with your AMA, I'm like, \"I know. I need to eat some food right now.\" You're like, \"Okay, I won't.\" I'm like, \"God damn it, Kevin.\" But like Joey and",

It is sunk. Okay. But yeah, but let's switch the imple, you know. So, this is my request. When when and if we do, cuz I I love this concept, but every iteration I've seen of this has been a nightmare because someone's overengineered it. And by that, I mean the IGN demo room.

We need to all be listening to each other on on headphones, not so that that's the big problem with all of these let's plays cuz we could do that. We're doing we're doing but the problem is we hear each other so we need to record it so it sounds clear and not echoey but also we need to be able to hear each other uh in real time not in lag time and not in like oh I hear them from another room.
