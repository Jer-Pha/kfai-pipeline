Pepper it and drizzle some olive oil.\n2) Put you cast iron skillet on the stove at medium high.\n3) Take the steaks -- which should be at room temperature or at least have been out of the fridge a bit -- and season them to your liking.\n4) Toss a knob of butter in the skillet and spread it around.\n5) Toss the steak in there. Let it cook for 3 minutes if you want a rare steak like me. Four for medium rare. Any longer than that and you are a crazy person who wants to ruin steak.\n6) Flip it. Let it cook for the same amount of time you let the first side cook for.\n7) Pull it off and let it rest a spell on the cutting board.\n8) Cut it up into strips. \n9) Put it over the salad, sprinkle some Parmesan, and you have a classy ass date meal.\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids",
