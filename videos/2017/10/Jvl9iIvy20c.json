I usually do an egg for every pound of wings.\n3) Mix flour, panko, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and garlic powder in bowl. Use a cup of Flour and a cup of panko, but use the spices to taste. You wanna see them in the mix.\n4) If you got full chicken wings, cut\u2019em at the joints and cut off the little thing no one eats.\n5) Get a baking sheet and cover it in parchment paper.\n6) With one hand, put a wing in the egg bath and then drop it into the flour mixture. With the other hand, cover the wing in the mix and pack it tight. Shake off the excess mix and place on the parchment-lined baking sheet.\n7) Bake for 20 minutes at 435. \n8) After the first 20 minutes, increase the temperature to 445 degrees, flip wings, and cook\u2019em another 20 minutes.\n9) Warm up your sauce. Dealer\u2019s choice.\n10) When the final 20 minutes is up, pull the wings and put them in a big ol\u2019 bowl. Toss them in the sauce.\n\nWING INGREDIENTS:\n2 lbs Wings\n1 cup Flour\n1 cup Panko bread crumbs\nCayenne Pepper\nBlack Pepper\nGarlic Powder\nEggs\nWing Sauce of your choosing\n---\nSTEP-BY-STEP CORN INSTRUCTIONS\n1) Shuck the corn.\n2) Boil some water.\n3) Toss the corn into the boiling water.\n4) Pull out the corn after 5 minutes.\n---\nBROCCOLI INGREDIENTS:\nBroccoli\nGarlic\nSalt\nPepper\nOlive Oil\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP BROCCOLI INSTRUCTIONS\n1) Trim and wash the broccoli.\n2) Get a wok on medium high heat.\n3) Toss some olive oil in there.\n4) Toss the garlic in there and stir for a minute or so. Don\u2019t let it burn!\n5) Toss in the broccoli. \n6) Salt and pepper the broccoli to taste.\n7) Stir around until it\u2019s the green and texture you like.\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids",
