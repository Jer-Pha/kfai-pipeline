I'm Tim Getty's joined by one of the coolest dudes in video games, Greg Miller. And joining me to my beautiful left is Candy Andy himself, Andy Cord. Is he beautiful or is this your left beautiful? Well, I make his left beautiful is what he's saying. It's kind of a give and take and egg type situation. Um, so I just want to get this out of the way. Going into this presentation, I was like, eh, Bethesda, not necessarily my favorite. Not that you're quality. I know that they're a hater. No, I just they're the game. I'm not a big fan of the games personally. And that just means I don't play them. Not that I I don't think that they're great. Uh this conference 10 out of 10. This is how you do a press conference. I think the one thing that it was missing was a one more thing, surprise, get hyped moment. I think from top to bottom, the fact that they had someone come out, Pete Hines,",

I think from top to bottom, the fact that they had someone come out, Pete Hines, have somebody that we're rooting for, like a person, a personality that we can like get behind to represent Bethesda, and then just boom, boom, boom, here's announcement after announcement, even though we already knew some of them and we knew some were coming, I think the presentation, even for things that weren't that interesting, they sold. They made fun to watch. And I think that that's something that EA can learn a lot from. So, you're divorcing yourself from these not being your your brand of games and saying that as a conference, this is a showcase on how to do it. Look at it with a person. Here's a million games. Entertaining little snippets between it and we go. Yep. And it keep it moving. Keep it fresh. And if something isn't going to engage with people, just make it make it",

I think this was an even better conference than they had last year. Uh last year, I think they focused on uh Dishonored 2. despite people loving that game. Yeah. The that bit in the conference was like 30 minutes long and it dragged a little bit. With this, it was just like the one two punch and they just kept punching and I was loving every minute of it. And I think that they did such a good job that it even sold me on games that I weren't wasn't sold on. Evil Within 2 looks fantastic. Evil Within one I was very trepidacious about and didn't even give a shot. That game looks great. That game looks like a Kojima Evil Within. Yeah, I'm in.

I think it was a great conference and I definitely think it was here's how you do it. I just feel this is one of the ones where it was spoiled in a way. Like even when they put up the two new IPs, right? We're all like, \"Oh, Evil Within Wolfenstein.\" You know what I mean? I would have rather there been we don't know what those are going to be. We don't know what we're going to get. Now, Wolfenstein 2 New Colossus, that trailer was awesome. I totally went from yeah, I played Wolfenstein. I know how much people like it. I played not even half of it. I don't know. I played the beginning section beyond that da da and it just fell out of it. Whatever that whole the whole trailer they did of like",

The group seems super cool. Exactly. When they gathered on the table, everybody had a personality. It was like a heist movie where you can see how everybody's going to be fun. And I'm like that's a group I want to hang out. That is a first person shooter I want to play. Absolutely. Yeah. So, Wolfenstein for me, um, one thing that I really enjoyed about it was that you can tell the visual difference between the first one and the and this one that they're showing us right now. Now, obviously, this is probably souped up running on a PC at ultra settings or whatever, but the first one, you could tell they made it knowing that it was going to be on PS3 and Xbox 360,",

Um, I liked part one. I didn't play I didn't beat all of it. I didn't beat the game, but I did enjoy part one. See, that was my thing for playing through the first I've talked about all the time about story horror and everything else. I just fell out of love with it early on, right? Like I felt like I got in there, all right, cool. I'm in a coma after this. But it was like when he I had to watch my dudes die or whatever. I was like, \"That's intense.\" But then getting out of it, it was just like, \"All right, I'm I'm losing the plot of why I care",

Let's try to do this. Rene or uh Mass Effect 2, get the team together. Get the team together and, you know, stop this in America. I'm like, \"All right, I get done with that. I get done with Absolutely, man.\" Yeah. I just I think that they did such a good job of starting off the conference mentioning that they got a little something everywhere from mobile to Switch to the main consoles and PC. Ending the conference saying all this stuff available this year. It's like this Bethesda isn't [\u00a0__\u00a0] around. They came out a couple years ago and they were like Fallout 4 available in November. And that was hype. That was real. And it wasn't something where it's like, \"All right, here's some games to get",

And it wasn't something where it's like, \"All right, here's some games to get excited for that are coming in in a couple years.\" It's like, \"No, this is coming now.\" And then last year, we saw the same thing with Dishonored. And even though we already knew a lot of the stuff was coming out, it's like there's a quality control to all of this. And I feel like that shows even in the the way they present the information. And that goes such a long way uh to get real fans and to get people that actually care about you as a brand and are people that might only be interested in Elder Scrolls, but then they see stuff like this and like, \"Oh, you know what? That looks pretty cool and I I trust these guys.\" They're building a lot of trust here. I think even going with the community stuff on that creation club sort of thing, like the hardcore fans really appreciate that. They",

They really appreciate a company that they love doing stuff for the fans. like this isn't stuff they really necessarily have to do, but they want you to be able to put mods into Skyrim and into Fallout or whatever. And I think that's cool as [\u00a0__\u00a0] This is what I've been talking about with Bethesda for a while, right, of them coming into their own. And we talked about it with Pete on the Games Cast here. You know what I mean? And the fact that they I think slowly started doing the thing where they were separating themselves and then this year in the past calendar years, the whole review policy and being more outspoken and Pete coming on these shows and not mincing words is they're they're allowing themselves to be Bethesda and have that mean something if that makes sense.

You know what I mean? Like you look at like an Activision and their corporation. That's what it is. This is the line. We're making money. We're doing this. Whereas Bethesda is like, \"Let's open our conference with our kids.\" That's not a normal thing to do. That's not a normal thing to do. But they're like, \"Fuck it. We don't care. We're going to go in there and we're going to do the conference we want to make for our audience.\" And it's to an extent similar to what EA is doing in the fact we're EA. We feel like we have to do this. And Bethesda is like, we feel like we're [\u00a0__\u00a0] Bethesda, which means that Pete at the front of the end, you know, not Todd. Hey, here's our kids. Pete's going to curse at the end. They what? When I was on the games cast, I said something [\u00a0__\u00a0] crazy was coming. That's it. This",

Like, I can get down with that. And that's the whole thing like what I'm talking about where I think this actually is an interesting thing, right? Of us coming off of kind of funny life 3 leading into kind of funny live 3. We keep talking about how do you top yourself? How do you top yourself? How do you top yourself? Inevitably, right, someone's going to eventually be like kind of funny live X is wasn't as good as Kind of funny live y. And I think that's the same thing here when you look in the chat where some people think this is a 10 out of 10. Some people think they're totally disappointed. I just think that from a DNA level, they nailed it so well of like, hey, here's a 40-minute press conference. There is",

We're not going to come out there and stumble through [\u00a0__\u00a0] Have people who teleprompter break and it all goes, \"These are the games. This is what we have.\" And then so Rowdy Thunder 124 in the chat says, \"I think Tim's 10 out of 10 is more because of the presentation versus the announcement. And here's some cool games you'll get this year. Let's get out.\" Absolutely. Yeah. But I also think that they they nailed how they announced these games. like not just the presentation of it, but the trailers and stuff made these games look exciting and made all of it feel like one cohesive hole in a way that all of this looks equally exciting. I mean, obviously there's things that are are the smaller things like um Elder Scrolls, the Legend card game, Elder Scrolls Online. But I mean,",

They look like real VR experiences, which is something we're not seeing enough of these days. Yeah. Um, on the VR front. So, that's exciting. And then ending it with two real games, Evil Within 2 and Wolfenstein 2. Um, Dishonored DLC coming out September 15th. That's which I guess reading the chat cuz we're not we're not Dishonored people. That character is from Dishonored one is what it seemed like maybe people and that's a few we didn't have that many Dishonored fans in our chat either. ones that were there seem to be flipping out and making reference to.

Yeah. I do. She's the boat lady from Dishonored, too. Thank you. It was essentially intro video with the kids, Pete Hines, and a Nintendo Direct and then Pete Hines at the end to cap it off. Like that [\u00a0__\u00a0] is that they did such a good job with that. I Yeah, it's one of those like we didn't have time to get bored with anything if that makes sense.

Sky or Elder Scrolls Legends. Okay. But then here's Skyrim Switch, which the Link amiibo. That looks [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome. I'm going to use that for sure. The motion controls I won't touch with the [\u00a0__\u00a0] 20 foot pole. No thank you. And then it's Dishonored DLC. Then we put in Quake World Championship. Then it's Evil Within 2. Then it's Wolf Sign 2. But I also like that they started it not only with the kids, but also that the hype montage showing their successes over even just the last year.
