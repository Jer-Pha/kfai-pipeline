I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the busiest lady in the business, Andrea Renee. Welcome back from the weekend. Welcome back to the weekend from you for the what now? Now, we were going to play Friday the 13th together, but you as usual got sucked into Paragon. Yes. Well, I mean, I did play some Friday the 13th on Friday, but we just didn't get to play together. I played with some other people. Um, yeah. Know, I we were talking before the show began. The thing about MOBAs is you don't know if your match is going to go 20 minutes where someone on the other team surrenders right away or if it's going to go like an hour and 20 minutes where you're like deadlocked for a really long time. Um, so it's really a crapshoot as to how long those matches last. And it's tough because, you know, you can't step away from it because it's a live PVP game. Even though I did have a friend who I",

This beloved console is coming back to stores in the form of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System Super NES Classic Edition. Quite the name. The Mini System, which contains 21 pre-installed classic games and can easily be plugged in to any highde definition TV using the included HDMI cable, will be available at a suggested retail price of $79.99. And for the first time, players who pick up the system can enjoy the intergalactic adventure Star Fox 2, the sequel to the original Star Fox game that was created during the Super NES era, but never released dot dot dot anywhere except for when the ROM leaked.

Well, I think um we should begin by commending Nintendo on a great games lineup for this box. They picked some really fantastic games that represent the SNES. Um I know that already people are some some fans of JRPGs are saying there's not enough, you know, JRPGs or RPGs in general represented in this list. You know, Chrono Trigger is a big one. that's missing. Um, but I think that, you know, if you look at how this will appeal to people from a wide variety of gaming backgrounds. I mean, they are picking like the the top hits, right?

Um, so I think this is a good lineup. I think they did a good job. I think the price is, you know, it's a little bit higher than I would like, but it's justified, I think, by the extra controller. Yeah. Um because a lot of these, you know, you can play with more than one person. Original NES only shipped with one. Correct. Correct. You had to buy a And what was the price on that? Do you remember off the top of your head? Pretty sure it was $59.99, but I'm going to look that up right now since I don't want to be wrong. It's an interesting one.

Whereas jumping into this, like Super Mario World, I think it's my favorite game of all time. Every time we do that list, I always forget what I put it around to. Earthbound, I've never played. Now, now all I never played it either, but I think this might be a good opportunity to go back. See, here's my problem. With all this said, just put these [\u00a0__\u00a0] things on the Switch.

We have a lot of questions about that and a lot of things, but I think the biggest thing people were worried about, right, is how long is this one going to be on sale for?

So, um, obviously a lot of people are reporting on this this morning. This is big news. Um, according to Mashables, Adam Rosenberg, a Nintendo rep told him in an email exchange, \"So NES Classic Edition is currently planned to ship from September 29th until the end of the calendar year 2017.\" At this time, we have nothing to announce regarding any possible shipments beyond this year. So, that gives you roughly three months to get your hands on one. Yeah. If you manage to snag a pre-order, great. Um, I think the idea that it only is going to be sold this calendar year is a little ludicrous. That seems incredibly short. That's how when when the original SNES or NES Classic came out, that seemed to be the thing, right? Is that they didn't tell you when more were coming. It was out there. It was hard to get.

So, we're talking about a much shorter window for the calendar year of 2016. And that went on sale and continue to be on sale through roughly April of this year before. Now, the only place that you can buy them is like a third party reseller like eBay or Amazon resellers. No one has like original boxes left. All the inventory is gone. So I mean that also was if you think about it that was like four to five months. This is like three months. That's even a shorter window.

You know, it's it's it's frustrating to think that there they have this product that they know a lot of people want. There was rumor that they stopped making the NES Classic early to save parts to build the SNES Classic. Okay. And if that's the case, then why is there such a short sale window? I mean, obviously, they're trying to capitalize on the holiday market. That makes sense. But I don't know why they wouldn't just build enough inventory after seeing the massive popularity around the first one to go, okay, we can sell easily double what we made for NES.

I have to imagine these love longer controller cables. However, will they learn from their mistakes? He's asking here, \"Was NES Classic a mistake?\" I I mean, this is classic Nintendo when we talk about them launching consoles, not the Switch where they're like legitimately there's no components, we [\u00a0__\u00a0] up, but for the other stuff where they don't put out enough cuz they want that buzz, they want that excitement.

You know, that's an interesting idea. the concept of is it a mistake? I don't think it's a mistake because it was very profitable for them. Yeah. Um I think that they maybe learned that if they put out more pieces of hardware, they can stand to make more money because the people who got their hands on switches and then resold them. You know, Nintendo doesn't get that extra profit. So, you would think that they as business people would say, \"Hey, obviously we sold out of these really quickly in order for us to make more. are the whole reason we're doing this.

I bet there's more, but I bet there's still way under what people want for it cuz I think Oh, absolutely.

You know, we've talked about this a little bit, but there are some people, you know, I was reading some of the responses to the news this morning that are frustrated that Nintendo is potentially taking um resources away internally to work on these standalone mini consoles instead of saying, \"How do we port all of our games to virtual console on the big console that they're trying to sell, the Switch?\" Yeah.

And then three, why not release an $80 SNES classic cartridge for Switch? Alleviate hard hardware costs driven folks eat up the hardware. No, I missed line. Driven hard. Alleviate hard hardware costs and production issues and give Switch owners a taste of virtual console while letting nostalgia driven folks eat up the hardware. Price is negotiable.

Now I want to drill more into this switch and then PlayStation 4 in particular. Go for it. Kotaku has been over there tracking the weekby- week sales from a variety of different sources. Uh and this is as in the PS4's first weeks versus the Switch first weeks in Japan. Uh there's this giant crazy chart. You can go over to Kotaku and see it there. Kevin's doing stuff.

Uh and some of these margins are actually pretty impressive seeing as how what you jump down here, right? And it's like you're pretty much in the 13,000s for uh the PS4 getting sold. But on the other side you're look at the other side you're looking at 41 45 48 76 these are granted obviously you're seeing here like what happened what the little Japanese reason for all this stuff happening but again crazy to see as Sony drops off into you know four digits you're still at five over here with Switch and stuff.

So what we're comparing is when the PlayStation 4 launches in Japan those weeks versus when the Switch launches in Japan those weeks. Got it. So that's why you're seeing the huge increase here at the top right of like basically 310,000 for PlayStation 4 in 2014 than 330,000 basically in 2017 for Switch. So it's like you're seeing them get outclassed. And this is just out of the gate obviously with different things. It's interesting to look at these numbers, I think, in comparison to the worldwide numbers because PS4's worldwide numbers were much greater than the Switch numbers, right? That was the thing.

The other two games that round out the Game of Show, the best of show award are Assassin's Creed Origins and Super Mario Odyssey. So, they each had four categories uh that they were nominated in. And then Destiny 2 landed three nominations. So, those are kind of like the top games that we've seen so far. As I mentioned, Ubisoft led all of the publishers with 14 nominations, 11 more than they received last year. I think that's a testament to their lineup that they had this year compared to what they showed last year.

So, not surprising that they're not really competing because they have a much smaller library of games. And for the breakdown where you're talking about PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, keep in mind that it's what judges saw these running on, right? So, like for me, when I nominated Wolfenstein for stuff, I had to nominate it on PC because that's what I was playing it on, right?

I feel like we still have this idea and mantra and headsp space in games that is if you don't play it to the credits if you don't if you don't invest all 20 40 30 hours into this game you're not you don't you you can't talk about it you don't know what you're saying you don't and it's just like that's not where we're at anymore",

So it's a combination and thank you for your question Grant. Um, there are many times when we get early code that we are required per our NDA agreements to turn the trophies off. And a lot of times, many of us probably just forget to turn them back on. Um, so I mean that's a really simple explanation. For me personally, I turn my trophies private because of harassment. I have been harassed via the message system and on Twitter and a variety of other places in the online space um for the trophies that I have or for the trophies that I don't have. And games are fun for me. Games are my escape and I don't need to deal with that. And so in order for me to eliminate that altogether, I just make them private.

That was I I you know we talked about this in the kitchen beforehand like before when I pulled the question that was already what I assumed the reason not even the harassment uh for you but everyone as a whole of why like I don't even know if well like when Adam Boy was there I don't even know if his trophies are hidden you know what I mean or I guess now Sean Leon or something to that effect why you'd hide your trophies and stuff because with all due respect you guys and us to an extent I assume on most of these things maybe not Adam but like on on a corporate executive level on a spokesperson level people are looking to",

It's like when remember when I was like I was like take it back in a fun way that Shu had no platinums back in the day and I sent him Hannah Montana on PS3 to platinum, right? It's that thing of like these people have lives and really important business jobs that have them going across the globe. I understand why they're not sitting there putting in all the work to get the platinum in Uncharted 4. They played Uncharted 4. They're happy. They know what Uncharted 4 is.

Also, I'm now working kind of funny. Nobody's coming for me like they were at IGN. People at IGN were getting sniped all the time and character assassination all the time. Well, another thing to take into consideration is that PlayStation doesn't allow you to change your PSN ID. And I have changed my PSN ID three times now. And so like any trophies that I had in my previous profiles are gone and I don't get to have them anymore. And also like Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Because you have you've remade your name, right? I've started a brand new profile. You have an inside scoop on how to change your PSN. No, no, no. I had to start over.

We could easily do it now like if we went back and tried to get that trophy, but it wasn't such an important like checkbox item for me that I needed to do it. And that's why I keep my trophies private. No, 100%. And it makes sense. I think especially like if I if times were different and like if I started at IGN now, right, and I wasn't on the PlayStation Beat and that's what I was covering and doing all those different things.
