My Irish cream Danny Odia. Whoa. Cream of the crop. Cream. Top of the morning. Never get a pig cuz a pig is a cop. Cheers, governor. Thanks for coming. Appreciate it. Sorry I'm late. Like I'm like a month late from my first Yeah, I know, right? Yeah. It's nothing like announcing two hosts at Kind of Funny Live 3 and then having one go on a monthlong vacation. I'm heading home. I'm heading home. I'm going to do E3 and then I'm getting the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out for a couple weeks. So, where where all you go? Oh man, I'm myself. My wife went to England. We went to London. I lived there for the best part of 5 years. So, it's kind of like showing her around. Um she crammed in as much Harry Potter [\u00a0__\u00a0] as you could possibly do. Yeah, it was it was real good.

Many of which were detailed recently in a 2K developer blog post. This includes matches featuring up to eight superstars, a more expansive backstage arena area, I should say. New weight detection and grapple carry systems, and much more. What's weight detection? You know, so like if you're like a little guy, right? You're trying to pick up Brock Lesnar. Yokuna. Exact.

This is back in like the This is the horror show that everyone had for the Switch is that what essentially we're going to get on the Switch is hackneed versions of like the real versions of the games like the PlayStation, Xbox ones.

And I guess PC doesn't help you here, but it's the fact of the matter is like I this goes back to my argument of when the Switch got announced. I was like, I'm all in. This sounds awesome. I think it'd be in a perfect world. I would love to them to say day in and day you're getting Mass Effect Andromeda on it too.

Great roster. Exactly. Great roster. The moves I mean like I you know covering it for so long like that team cares and I know that it's it's a Madden syndrome right of like you put one out and you got nine months to turn the other one around.

They're making a sim game there, which is great and was going to shine on your PlayStation 4 Pro or your Xbox One X one day in 4K and all the chess. The problem is like if you're trying to do something that looks more real every year, to then take the most real version you've ever made and put it on the Switch means that there's going to have that stiff [\u00a0__\u00a0] hair character create, it's going to load forever on character creation.

Yeah, that was the first game I went to play because I thought, okay, let's see how the Switch is able to. Let's because it's the exact same problem is that like they tried to make the Wii versions and eventually what they ended up doing was making specific Wii versions and the Wii version of Pro Evolution Soccer is like one of the best football games ever made.

That's not going to get them. I wonder if that brings up really you know awkward discussions within 2K though because you basically have I mean they are on a very specific path with the WWE games and have been for like the best part of a decade like they're trying to make this type of simulated like televisual experience right so then if they suddenly create an alternative version to that they're essentially like putting them up against each other and not not in terms of sales I mean in terms of like the sort of public discussion around it. So essentially what you might have is you might have like one creative director saying we're going to go this way and then putting up what a lot of people have said is what they",

I think it's a good idea. But the the interesting thing there would be like well would that competition finally spur them to actually get the you know wrestle the the prime game back on its feet the way people want it to? Cuz the problem with the 2K whatever games is there's no competition and they are minor upgrades every year and but it is it's the same problem with Madden and it's one of those where they march and speak to such a specific audience that if I'm in there trying to explain to you how I'm going to make this game bigger and better.

And recently, a trailer showed off a pretty awesome Mega Man fan game that's coming this week called Mighty Number Call. Shut up, Danny Odwire. Call the Mega Maker. It's meant to be a Mario Makeresque title for the Mega Man series, and it's currently scheduled to launch on July 15th. From the short look in the trailer, the game seems really cool.

Uh, the team of fans working on the game cannot charge for it as that would violate Capcom's copyright terms uh, since it uses Capcom made assets. Mega Makaker's website makes sure to say that the assets are property of Capcom as well as that the team won't commercialize the game. However, the developer is taking donations through a Patreon campaign to help fund the server costs. They're up to $26 right now. It will be interesting to see how much more they get.

So and there was that other the Mega Man when Colin always used to tell the story how when Mega Man's anniversary was coming around the fans were making a game and Capcom totally was ignoring it and then I think they published the fan-made game, right?

Let's take different bosses, enemies, level types, and we're going to mix them around in different interesting ways.

I think Capcom will let it go because I feel like it's not a game they could publish cuz it's or make and maybe they could pick it up now, but it is one of those things that's so blatantly a copy of Super Mario Maker.

So, when I see something like this, I'm like, \"Okay, we've created basically the same marketplace that doesn't benefit those, but they're only focusing on indie games.\" And I was looking at some of the games.

These are marketing. Yep. This is like these are demos. This is the demo of why you should play this game. And we're not saying that like they're not going to add in feedback, but it's a totally different kettle of ballparks to say, I don't know, let's look at early access games even like they're all ultimately player on battlegrounds. the the way that game is getting shaped is based a lot on feedback from players.

And he says, \"I know this one is a long shot, but did anyone play 50 Cent Blood on the Sand on PS3?\" Probably not. The first 50 Cent game, Bulletproof, wasn't very good on PS2. And by the time Blood on the Sand came out, 50 Cents Mass Appeal was on the decline. But if you did play this game, I'm sure you are aware that there was a surprisingly good third person thirdp person score-based shooter. Anyways, I'll cut to it. I want to play through the game for the third time on the hardest difficulty. However, I",

A as parenthesis, funnily enough, I can't find anybody else with a copy. So, I figured this would be the best way of finding someone to join me in my third playthrough of this masterpiece. Thanks, kind of funny, fam. # make make 50 Cent Blood in the sand, too. Uh, I remember 50 Cent Blood in the sand. Eric Brvig and Hillary Goldstein were obsessed with this back in the day at IGN and they would grenade [\u00a0__\u00a0] They'd yell around saying that because that was like one of the lines which is the one with [\u00a0__\u00a0] where my skull remember? Oh, this is it. This is it. Yeah. You run around looking for golden skulls or whatever in this game. Diamond skull. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Uh so now if you want to play with James I'm going to read you his PSN name here. Strong PS. It's the type of PSN name you would get from somebody who's playing this game. Exactly. It's Kill It Bang forever, I believe, but it's with a C. So it's C I L L I T bang forever which for a while I was like [\u00a0__\u00a0] no and then I was like sill it bang forever. I'm sure there's something I I'm missing but c I l I can literally tell you if you want number four ever. This is why you need a European once in a while. Silit bang is the name of a popular uh like toilet cleaning like spray and there's this guy called Barry Scott who does like commercials for it. He's like, \"I'm Barry Scott and this is Silit Bang.\" And it became like basically a meme in television advertising and you need to watch the Silang.

Exactly. Yeah. The number numeral four in there forever. Shout out to Barry Scott. Uh Nanny. All right. What are we getting wrong? Not too much. Okay, good. All right. First one. Snarky Starky says, \"Greg asked if there was a June 31st this year. There is never a June 31st, even on Leers.\" Thank you. Thank you, Trevor. Little fact. Um, it Street Fighters, Mega Man, Cross Street Fighter. Remember that came out Cross Street Fighter. Okay. Yes. A bunch of people um talked about it. I'm going to do this one for Alan McAdams.

Street Fighter Course Mega Man was released as a free download from Capcom Unity on December 17th, 2012. It celebrates the 25th anniversary of both Capcom's Mega Man and Street Fighter franchises. Nice work. And the last one comes in from Capitalist Pig, who kind of looks like John Vignyaki. Very much so. Right. I'd say it.
