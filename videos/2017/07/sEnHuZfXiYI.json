Has that all American Playboy look to him, I would say. You know what I mean? And so here like as I feel with all of my picks, we need to talk about what is the DC extended universe, which by the way, I [\u00a0__\u00a0] hate that they call that. It's just DCU. DCCU Cinematic Universe. Marvel had it. Why do we why do we worry about that? or just the DCU, then it would get confusing with comics. I understand Columbia universe.

He was cut, don't get me wrong, and he looked great and and for the first two movies, the fight scenes looked awesome. And then Ben Affleck Batman, right? Like, shut up. He's like huge and he's doing the video game takedowns and all this awesome [\u00a0__\u00a0] we we've never seen before. But to have a Batman who would be more like like [\u00a0__\u00a0] think of it, Ed Norton Batman would be like Batman Noir doing this a real basic suit on him, right? And then he'd be the Batman from like the opening of the animated series where he's he's dodging fists rather than engaging rather his fighting style isn't getting up. It it isn't getting up and beating you. It isn't Bales like hanging above you and doing something. It's letting you make all the mistakes and then [\u00a0__\u00a0] one punch and knocking you out or he sleeps in the shadows. He's very much about the subuge. Punch the dick. Block dick. Punch punch",

I'm going to throw these out at you guys right now cuz I think that it would be [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome to see either of these guys dawn the cape and cowl Idris Elba. Another example of these are just people that you would put in any role in most roles. But I would love to see like it would be fascinating to see a black Batman like to see Idris Elder this giant hulk king of a man cuz like we always think of Bruce Wayne as white but there's nothing necessarily in his past that dictates that he has to be a Caucasian male right see if we're if like if we were to choose an African-American man as Batman yeah specifically this is where like I already know who I'm choosing so Will Smith I want to see him do it cuz he Yeah he's",

So, man, like he could be that would get interesting in the in the universe. Flashoint. Well, I mean, let's be perfectly honest. Floyd Lton is now Batman. Flash point. Do we really feel like we're going to see a lot of Floyd Lton in the rest of the like was that that Okay. I mean, um I'm also going to shout give a shout out to our boy, The Rock, who I think could play Batman. I think he could. This is Yeah, this is just a list of let's put people we like in movies. Um and don't get me wrong, my fun movies. Talk about the people that we like are excited to see in movies and stuff. So that makes sense that we're throwing the actually is my is my wacky choice.

How was ballers episode one? Don't spoil it. Great. I can't wait to watch it tonight. Idris Elba in that Dark Tower movie looks awesome. Looks [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome. But it's like I feel like that's what I want from an interesting looking movie. Yeah, it is. But where it's like a role where it's like I mean I'm sure there's many people that are huge fans. I know there are. I'm not. I don't [\u00a0__\u00a0] know anything about that. So I see this slowly the book's amazing is now making this character for me. Like I'm going to think of this character as you're not a huge fan of Dark Tower. I just don't know what it is. I I'm not familiar with it that much. I thought you said I thought you meant but you're not a fan of him. Oh, who the [\u00a0__\u00a0] not a fan of? Yeah, he's a bad [\u00a0__\u00a0] No, he's like perfect.

Um The Rock is probably my wild card like or my my zany pick. I like putting The Rock in as Batman is completely absurd. Of course it is very absurd. Do Do you remember Can I talk Can I continue on the rock? Do you do you do you remember the first time The Rock hosted SNL? Cuz it was a huge moment for me in my WWE brethren cuz he was there. No, that wasn't that one. But he did a sketch where he was Clark Kent but Superman, you know what I mean? Or whatever. And so it's him at the Daily Planet typing and he's in this way too small dress shirt and tie and like you can see the Superman thing and like everyone's [\u00a0__\u00a0] with him cuz everyone's like, \"You're obviously Superman.\" And so everybody's like making comments about Super. He's like defending him or whatever. It' be the exact same thing of like Batman's [\u00a0__\u00a0] huge Samoan and then then",

That is fair. That is fair. Um my last pick just going younger is an actor that I love and I want to see him do more stuff is Nicholas Hol. Are you familiar with this guy? Is this a real one? He's a real This is This would be kind of like a throw in there. He's very young right now. Now he looks pretty like he's the guy he plays the young he plays young beast in Jazz. I didn't realize I didn't like I didn't think he'd be a valid choice until I realized that he was 6'3. So I feel like if you can get him jacked with this baby face. Oh, he'd be a good looking. It's crazy what studios can do to actors bodies with enough money and time. Like",

Write it down. Just say it right now. Okay. I'm going to do my crazy one. All right. Give me your crazy. I'd really like to see Jude Law, okay, play the role because I think his overthe-top I'm a huge fan of Jude Law in the same way that I am with Edward Jude Law. I love Jude Law. I'm I think the only person in the world that's watched uh New Pope Young Pope. You're not the only person, but there was there's a handful of young go. I really want you to watch it cuz I think that like the way it's shot, every shot I look at in that thing, I'm like, \"Oh my god, looks beautiful.\" Dian Katon's in it. I just think that he'd be so kooky. Yeah. You know, he'd make a great I don't",

You know, he'd make a great I don't think Batman. I think kooky. Hey, he said this is the fun. All what I'm saying is like he could play the like playboy aspect really well and he also plays a crazy psychopath like super serious like I'm super determined role also really well. But Jude Law I feel like doesn't look anywhere near the right like aesthetic for it. No, he's probably a little too small for but again and Norton he could fit in that. There are lots of different types of Batman. And then my like second pick for the crazy one is I'd really like to see um and we're talking about Batman Beyond. Yeah. Jack Nicholson playing Batman, which I know is crazy cuz old Batman the actor who I can't remember his name right now from uh Baby Driver being the lead of Baby Driver being Terry McInness.

Oh yeah, that that aspect of it. Not the the Batman cuz he wasn't taking it serious. And thank God for what's the other guy's name? Ken No. Ko. Ko. That's it. Oh yeah. Yeah. He saves his life every time. Sure. Yeah. Did you do your crazies? I think so. I think my rock's the craziest. Okay, cool. We all They got looped together at the end. We just started throwing out actor names. Originally for the crazy, I was going to say Joe Peshy cuz Kevin Spy. That would be [\u00a0__\u00a0] Kevin Spy is an old. That would be really cool.
