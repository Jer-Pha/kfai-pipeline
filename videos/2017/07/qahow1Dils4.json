I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the busiest lady in the business, Andrea Renee. Hi, Greg. Hey, how are you? You know, I'm great. It's been a very busy week, hasn't it? It has been, right? Yes. It never ends. There's always something. What have you been up to? Well, um, we've been, um, so the What's Good Games crew is in town and so we've been shooting a bunch of Patreon exclusive videos and getting ready for some streams later today. The Epic Games team is coming by to stream some Fortnite with us. Uh, the lovely Nick Chester is is going to be there. We know him well. He's a great person. Yeah. What time is that? If you want to watch that is uh 3:30 p.m. Pacific time. It's twitch.tv/ TV/whatgoodames if you would like to join us. Uh we have the two Patreon exclusive streams. So if you want to get in on those, you got to How often do the girls come down to San Francisco",

Unless there's a con and then we can do stuff at the con here for sure. That makes sense. But yeah, so essentially once a month. Cool. Cuz otherwise, you know, travel's expensive and we aren't, you know, rolling in the dough yet. Yet. Key word. Someday. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Well, that's fun. That's cool. Yeah. You going to play some a game if you're playing Fortnite. They're offseing Life is Strange, right? Joey and I went and saw it yesterday. Can't talk about it obviously, but yeah, excited to eventually talk about it. Yeah. So, I mean, we did a a playthrough at San Diego Comic- Con, which was really exciting.

Cool. I got Patapon, but I can't talk about that either. I saw a tweet about Patapon from shoes. If everything goes right, Kevin, and come give me a fist pound, big kev dog. There should be a Patapon let's play up tomorrow morning of me playing Patapon, right? Did I miss? Yes, I talked about that. Okay, cool.

We get really messy with it. We go. We boil down all the news that's happening. There's a lot happening today. We talk about it at length. We take your questions. We read you bad PSN names and we have a good time each and every day on a variety of platforms. If you want to watch live, we record it on twitch.tv/kindfunny games, but we ignore the chat.

If a motion capture actor's resume is to be believed, Grand Theft Auto 6 is well into production. You don't say, Andrea. What? As if this would be worked on. Spotted by Neogaf user Chad Skin. Jesus. Actor Tim Nef has listed motion capture work for both Red Dead Redemption 2 and the much or the very much unannounced Grand Theft Auto 6 on his resume. And then it was a little image of what I just read. Uh then they had an update to this IGN story. Actor Tim Nef has publicly stated that the resume posted under his name on Breakdown Express is incorrect and that he does not even have an account on the website to post his resume.

He went on to tell PC Games N on Twitter. This is how news happens now, by the way. Uh that that this that is in my page account or resume. I don't even know that website. I worked on GTA 5 a long time ago and haven't done anything since. Andrew, what do you think? I think in a world post fake um Nintendo NX like that like 3D printed fake console thing, the one where we had the reflection in the window and all this stuff. Yeah. That you don't ever know what's true anymore. And it's I wouldn't put it past some enterprising young individual to make a fake account and plant this news.

Is it going to be for online specifically or is it going to be single player expansions for GTA 5? Or is it the next one? We don't know. But yes, they're definitely working on something. Exactly. Could this be faked? I think this could be highly faked. Yeah, of course. And it sucks for if it is totally if Tim Nef has nothing to do with this and suddenly he's in the middle of this. That sucks for him. Sucks for him. Yeah. But only I guess it only really sucks if he really is working on Grand Theft Auto 6. Cuz if he's not, Rockstar knows he's not and it's like, \"Oh no, no foul.

Hey, look at I'm getting my name out there as a motion capture artist and this that and the other. That's cool. Yeah, but he's getting his name out there as somebody who broke confidentiality. Cuz I have to imagine at this point after so many of these resume leaks that it's built into their NDA now, their non-disclosure agreement that actors have to sign when they work on these top secret projects that they can't post things like this updates about the project in their resume until the project is announced.

I mean, I've said on the Games Cast before that I'm not a fan of, you know, the overall narrative of GTA 5, but I commend Rockstar for the excellent work that they did in crafting that story. I think a lot of people really appreciated it. Sometimes it can be challenging for players to get a grasp on what's happening with the story if you're constantly having to shift focus and perspective, but think about some of the other really big IPs out there. A lot of them focus on multiple protagonists. So, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think it's great.

And I rounded down units in total up to the end of June. GTA's closest competitor was Ghost Rec Recon Wildlands, which sold around 20,000 fewer units. Horizon Zero Dawn finished in at third in the video game chart, which is awesome. New IP getting out there and only having one platform to run on compared to Wildlands with uh FIFA 17 at number four and Call of Duty Infinite Warfare at number five, rounding out the top five. GTA 5 has been in the top 10 NB uh MPD for the entire year for the last, you know, several years that it's been released.

It's um it's a fourplayer with quotations, four player squad-based shooter, but it's you playing all the pieces, all the pieces. And so then you can rotate between all the people in your squad. Um, so you pick one character to go into the level with or into the mission with and then you pick your teammates and then you can kind of uh hot swap between your teammates. Now the gameplay is fun. It's got that wacky over the top thing that Valition is known for. Crazy guns, these wacky enemies that you face off against with, you know, like oneline zingers and things like that.

All they had at the GameStop thing when we were doing it was this reveal. Here's the different types of classes and stuff.

Despite a relatively strong start with a solid player base, the number of users dropped off significantly, mostly due to rampid server and balancing issues in the online multiplayer modes. Though there's still a dedicated community dueling online at this very moment, the developers behind the ambitious online brawler are looking to reignite the fire of battle with a slew of new features and balance adjustments to the core game. Taking cues from Ubisoft's other titles such as Rainbow Six Siege and The Division, Ubisoft Montreal plans to reinvigorate for Honor by introducing the following balance fixes.

All these changes will be tested via public test environments on PC with a first test starting today. What's your read on this, Andrea?

It wasn't too long, not too short. Could it have been more robust? Sure. So, I don't know what the length or what the narrative arc of, you know, the new Colossus is going to be, but could they have put this in there and packaged it in and made a better value for that base price?

Of course, uh it's basically what's been said here. He's talking about this pretty quickly. Facebook comments wondered if Nintendo was locking game modes behind the amiibo.

This wouldn't be the first time Nintendo and other developers have experimented with amiios. Splatoon locked challenges for single player behind them. Shovel Knight had an entire co-op mode inside an amiibo and Breath of the Wild was the only way to you have the Twilight Princess Wolf with you with use using the amiibo. Uh, this does then this is clappic again. This doesn't feel right though. Unlock things early. Fine. Special costumes, whatever.

Well, but that's the the the difference is is that these are tied to a physical item that can be very difficult to acquire. There are there was been there's been problems in the past with Nintendo and amiios and lack of availability or if the region that you're in or the game store that's in your town doesn't have enough stock of that particular amiibo, you know, having to try to find one online.

My biggest complaint is the voice chat solution that they have presented for the Switch. I'm not even a huge voice chat guy in my games, but this entire idea seems so egregious and it seems so Oh, no. And it seems as though few people are talking about it. Here's what I'll tell you right now. Real quick, Ethan, [\u00a0__\u00a0] put paragraph breaks in this. If you're going to write a giant [\u00a0__\u00a0] rant, don't give me a block of text. It seems like a lot of people kind of shrug it off as, \"Oh, Nintendo or those Japanese developers are wacky.\" I realize that the number of games that you would want to chat with, Andrew, why is are people not as mad as they should be about People are mad.

I mean, here's the thing. He hits it here in saying that the I realize the number of games that you would want to chat for on the Switch is much more limited than the other consoles, but if PlayStation or Xbox were to come out with the same solution, everyone would be having a [\u00a0__\u00a0] fit and starting petitions.

Nintendo has not really had this before. or they've never really jumped into it the way that Xbox Live and PSN, you know, are existing. And I think that they're not getting a pass. I think it's crap. I think the fact that I had to pull up my phone and then if I get a text message, it disconnects me from the chat is [\u00a0__\u00a0] It's bad.

I know there's been a lot of optimism and enthusiasm for what Nintendo has been doing this year, and they have hit a lot of really great strides. However, if they ever want to really compete with Xbox and PlayStation in the console market again, they need to get this worked out. They need a better solution. They need to integrate it into the platform. Having a chat client within your software on your hardware cannot be that difficult. The Vita did it. Well, Reggie's the thing that made me mad was Reggie's response. Did you read the response he gave to IGN?

They're going to fix this. They're going to optimize the app. They're going to make it easier and better to use. I'm going to be able to, you know, have multiple apps open at the same time. I should be able to answer text messages on my phone and not disconnect from chat. That's like a basic functionality that they have to fix.
