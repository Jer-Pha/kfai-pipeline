Of course, you can order or play or buy or do whatever you want with The Witcher on PlayStation 4, Xbox One or PC, but we're going to play it on PlayStation 4. Uh, and what we're going to do today is just do a kind of a series of side quests and explore this swampridden countryside as we are in one specific area of the game. The maps are kind of split up into multiple areas. This is basically the second place that you'll end up in the game. Sure. So, we're a bit into the game at this point, right? But we don't want to spoil the story for you. No, we don't want to spoil the story. And I I'm so OCD about these games that I'm just not far enough in the story to want to have it spoiled",

Uh, there's an overwhelming amount of things to do, right? I feel like there's more to do in this game than any other western role playing game I've ever played. Um, because there are side quests, there are hunts and and Witcher missions, plus the main quest.

Yeah, but who knows? Maybe we'll invite some fans back to our room to play with us and then we can also play the Wisher. N Hey, talking about my balls. You're a funny dude. Real funny.

There are weather cards that affect the different lines, but so you see the gems next to each player, the red gems. It's best out of three. Okay. And the idea is the cards that you have are the only cards you have for all three games. Or there can be two games if you win both. So the idea is to like you're those zeros next to each name or this total strength on each row combined. Okay? And the idea is to know when you're going to lose or win and start passing because you're going to need your cards to um to win later round.

So you can use like another arrow there if you want or like using this guy just to make it five, right? But then it's going to be tied and that might be a waste. Like you try to I would use the I would personally use the four uh arrow guy there and see what he how he responds.

So if you if you resign now and he won, then you both have eight cards left to play the next two games, okay? And so on and so forth.
