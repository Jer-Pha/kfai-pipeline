            "text": "Alright, so now we jump into Mega Man 5, which I have quite an affinity for as well. I think Mega Man 5 is a great game. And we'll watch the intro here and we'll let it ride for a minute so you can see. The bad guy in this game, presumably, or purportedly, is Proto Man. I love that shot of Dr. Light getting kidnapped by Proto Man with his scarf falling. Alright, so that little intro sets the stage and we'll jump in. Now with Mega Man 5 you can start in a few different places. I like to start with Star Man. Here you can jump really high because there is no gravity. Yep. Kevin asked if I was on a satellite, I answered in the affirmative. Yeah, the bullet's bigger. Now if you get hit when you're charging, it will knock the charge out of you. So that's a different gameplay mechanic. You want to deal with these guns before they pop up. Alright, so these little letter tablets. What are they? Why are they here? If you can spell here in the menu Mega Man 5, you will get beat. Beat is Mega",

If you can spell here in the menu Mega Man 5, you will get beat. Beat is Mega Man's bird. Let me see. Tough jump. This is a tough jump too. Because again, just like when you're underwater, you have way too much momentum. So there's four guns here, we can get rid of all of them before we continue. A little AT-ST type walker enemy. This can be really hairy so you want to get out of here as soon as possible. Because these guys will just swarm the shit out of you. Alright, and we are to Star Man's lair. Now Star Man, like Wood Man in Mega Man 2, like Skull Man in Mega Man 4 uses a shield, but he is way easier to beat than those other two enemies. Nehh Wow, thosePackage are all going directly through. So, for beating Starman, you get Starcrash Plus, or Starcrash Plus. And you get the Super Arrow, which we'll show you later. Next stage is Gravity Man stage. Now, Gravity Man",

Next stage is Gravity Man stage. Now, Gravity Man has one of the most interesting, if not the most single most interesting stage in any Mega Man game. And you're going to find out why, but it'll also have these arrows right over there. And these arrows change their formation, allowing you to go up and down. Oop. Wow, I don't know what I'm doing. There we go. So, you can avoid those guys. Those guys can't be destroyed. You just gotta kinda dodge them the best you can. You can deal with particular enemies. Deal with them. Don't try to go under them. They can haunt you if you do. We'll deal with that. We'll go down. Now, these guys take a ton of damage. You don't really wanna... Oof. They also give a ton of damage, as you can see. So, you don't really wanna trifle with them. Just skip them if you can. Now, this, you just jump, and you end up",

I love the upside down ladder, as well. Make sure to press over. So, we're at Gravity Man's stage. Now, Gravity Man's easy enough, actually, to beat with the Mega Buster, but we can use the Star Crash to our advantage here. You just have to get close to him, and kind of not... You don't wanna collide with him. You just want to be near enough to him where the Star Crash can hit him, like that. That was not the ideal. There, and that's it. He's done. And Gravity Man's down. Now, Gravity Man gives you a weapon called the Gravity Hold that is not all that useful. It's kind of a corny weapon, actually, and I'll show you. I won't even show it to you until we",

I won't even show it to you until we use it. So, you can see exactly what I mean. Start... Maybe start to run out of some ideas here, in terms of weapons, at this point in the series. So, from here, we're gonna go to Gyro Man. Cool little stage here. Take the lift up. And we're cruising along. Those enemies, obviously, their shields will block. These guys, you're gonna wanna avoid, since they can't be killed. Gonna continue along, and kill those guys with one hit. Those little chicken enemies are interesting. We'll just grab the light. Ah, didn't really need it. Let these guys come to you. Don't rush. They'll knock you off the platform. Then you can go up. Grab that, just to be safe. Climb up the ladder. Continue along, up. Avoid most of that havoc by just taking the top half. And then, for this guy... Gotta go. Alright, so",

Alright, so these guys can make some problems for you. So, there, it's fine to die. You can actually get it without dying the A. You can jump back up. I didn't do it very well, because I actually had just gotten hit by an enemy. The brilliance of that, though, is that the checkpoint is right here, so you don't have to worry about it. Okay, this part can be a little hectic, as it moves by itself. You just gotta use the leverage of the path below you to jump, and not jump too high, and not jump too late. Or you're gonna hit those spikes, and they'll kill you immediately. So, we're getting close to the end here. And we'll deal with this last gun here, and then we'll go to the Gravity Hold. And I'm gonna show you what it's all about as we fight Gyro Man. It's kinda corny. And Gyro Man's easy enough, actually, to",

And Gyro Man's easy enough, actually, to beat with the Mega Buster as well. So, much like Rain Flush in Mega Man 4, much like Centaur Flash in Mega Man 6, it's an attack that just takes up the whole screen. And so you just use it. You don't have to aim it. You just have to make sure that you don't want to spam it or you're gonna waste it. You just have to use it. Boom, boom, boom, boom, and Gyro Man's no more. So with that, Gyro Man is finished. And we'll acquire his weapon, which is the Gyro Attack. I've also got the Rush Jet, as you can see here. And with that, we'll move on to Crystal Man. Now, Crystal Man has staged a pain in the ass. But we're gonna see what we can do here. So if you destroy those things before destroying the ball, the ball bounces. If you destroy the ball, it'll destroy the base. So you want to destroy the",

So you want to destroy the ball. I'm sorry I keep looking at my phone. I was getting text messages here. Things are happening. Things are happening. The situation is fluid. Alright, so this is why Crystal Man's stage is just a straight pain in my ass. You just have to time your jumps really carefully here. And wait for these things to stop. And there's really no rhyme or reason to it. You just gotta watch and wait for gaps. And if you rush or don't make the right jump, you're just gonna smash right into a hole and you have to do it again. So sometimes I just wait until I'm comfortable. Alright, we're through. We're gonna have to do one more of those and it's gonna be way harder. But at least we're through that and we don't have to worry about that anymore. Eddy giving us some energy.

Remember we were introduced to Eddy in Mega Man 4. These are Diamond or Crystal Joes. A play on Sniper Joe. Or Hammer Joe from Mega Man 3. Sniper Joe, of course, Mega Man 1 too. So again, we're closer to the Crystal things now so we're gonna have to just be extra careful. So we're dealing with those guys. So we just wait, we wait, we wait. We're gonna go through. Deal with the enemies first. We're gonna have to concentrate on both of these things at the same time. It's not worth it. Okay, we're through. Phew, I hate that shit. It's a pain in the ass. Deal with that guy, take this up. So here, grab the E-Tank. And then... Oh, so there's an M-Tank up there. M-Tanks are Master Tanks there. That's the Rush Coil in this game. It sucks. The Master Tank fills up all your weapon energy. All of them. You want to save it for Wily's",

Remember we're filling up our Mega Man V tokens to get Rush. Rush will be very useful, especially on the last boss in the game. Oop, that was stupid. Ugh, in bad shape here. Alright. I don't know if I want to just commit suicide here or what. Well, let's try to see what we can do. Why not? So Gyro Attack can actually be controlled in the air, so I can actually send it upwards at will. And, well, good. If you stay close to him he's not going to attack, so you can stay on top of him. And that's the end of Crystal Man. I love the shimmering of the gems. It's pretty cool. So we get Crystal Eye, and with that we're going to move on to Napalm Man. So these",

So these tigers do a lot of damage and they're a pain in the ass, and when you shoot they're going to attack you, so use a full attack on them and kill them from afar before they pounce. That's why they have that energy right away, because they know you're going to learn some hard lessons the first time you play. Here these bombs come at you and you just need to shoot them from afar. Climb up the long ladder. This E-Tank can just be gone by going through an invisible wall right there. There's a lot of text messages here. Extra life. Back out in the forest. These guys need to be hit in the head for damage. Remember we're going to need this N, so grab that. Let me just avoid that. We don't really need the extra life.

Oh, jumped right into that. So I'm using my invincibility there to play games there. You don't want to try that unless you're experienced in Mega Man, what I just did. So these missiles, let them come out and go back down and jump over them. And we are in Napalm Man. So the Crystallize is an interesting attack in that if it misses it'll bounce and make a bunch of different shards that will then bounce around. So it's somewhat useful, but you want to try to stay on Napalm Man if you can and just attack him directly so you have at least control over what's going on. Because otherwise you have a situation like this I can't attack again until... Oh, right in. Let's see if I can put him away. That should be the end. Ooh, that was close, but that's good.

Answering a bunch of text messages here. Trying to multitask. Alright, so with Napalm Bombs from Napalm Man we're going to go to Stoneman. Okay. Okay. So we're continuing to cruise through the intro here to Stoneman's stage. Now this is a thing you're going to want to pay attention to. You're never going to know that's there, but you have to go through this to get the G. That's like really the only well hidden token in the game for a beat. So we're going to keep cruising. We'll get rid of these guys behind us so they don't continue to stalk us. Taking a little too much damage here. Got to cool it down. I'll use that energy up there. These things are mines basically. They'll explode so you want to just stay away from them. Perfect. Geez. There we go. These mice are too small, too low to the ground to fight with regular attacks on",

He's got me trapped. That was stupid. I shouldn't have done that. That's what happens when you get a little overzealous. Okay. Climb up the ladder and draw these guys out. You can get that extra level if you need it. We really don't need it. Get rid of these guys. Brings you up diagonally. So we can get that E-Tank and we're going to do that now. And the way we do that is we simply use the Rush Jet. You can also use the Super Arrow if you want. But I just feel like I have a little more control with the Rush Jet. Here's Eddy again. What he's got for us. More shit I don't need. There we are at Stoneman. Now Stoneman, not surprisingly, is weak to bombs. Nippon bombs. We're going to use them",

So it's cool to try to set them up basically where he lands. So he's dead and we'll get the Power Stone weapon from him. Sorry, I'm just going to answer more text messages because I'm getting bombarded here. Okay, Stoneman's done. We go to Chargeman. Chargeman's an interesting enemy because this is actually the other place other than Stoneman and Gravity Man where I think you could realistically start your cycle. The reason I say that is because we're going to fight Chargeman with our Arm Cannon anyway. He is weak to Power Stone but it is just hard to use on him. And he's just not that hard to fight without it. So if you're looking for a place",

It's probably the only other realistic place you have. Of course, this game's not super hard overall where you can probably fight most of the enemies. There's like no Pharaoh Man or Shadow Man or Quick Man or something like that where you're really going to have some problems in this particular game. These new trainmets are pretty cool. I like them a lot. The background's really cool too. Clouds are whirling by as the train charges down the tracks. Now we're inside the train. It might be subtle for you watching at home but I like how the screen goes up and down a little bit to represent the movement of the train. There's a lot of cool design choices in this game. With",

Weapons aren't so unique but the stages certainly are. So here we're going to want to get the A. Probably should have cleared some of these enemies out first. Get them a little tasty. So here we are at Charge Man again. We can use Power Stone but we're not going to. We'll just stick with what we know. God man, it's ripping me up. Shit. This next shot should do it. Alright, so Charge Man is finished. Okay, so we have the charge kick and now we're going to move on to Wave Man, the final boss. Sorry. Okay. Sorry, truth be told, I just got these text threads going on with my uncle about how I play in a pretty serious fantasy league with him. Fantasy football",

And I don't mind answering those so I do apologize if I'm being rude. That is not my intent. Oops, I didn't mean to do that either. Okay. Bad jump. So the steam coming out of the ground does indeed hurt you and you have to kind of cause it to come out by getting close to it so you have to just kind of be patient there. These bubbles, so the little bubbles that appear are tiny and you can't stand on them for very long but they're used as platforms to use quickly to get from a big bubble to a big bubble. So here we're going to jump onto this little cart and this is kind of a very unique, again we're talking about unique stages and things that are just different in",

Got to avoid these fish the best we can. So we got through that section, we're going to have to fight this little mini-rosser. Alright, there we go. And now I'm getting another text message from someone else. I'm sorry about that. There. Alright, so you're going to see that there's no ceremony. We have beat now. But you don't really know unless you look at the menu. Just made it. I'm going to commit suicide here against Wave Man and let him do his thing here. I don't really have enough energy to fight him so we'll just let him do his thing and then I'll just stand here. Okay, perfect. Okay, so",

So you're going to slide in enemies. You'll see that we have beat on the bottom now. So you're going to have to sacrifice a little bit here. That's the end of Wave Man. See Wave Man uses his harpoon attack and then also his wave attack as well. So he is dynamic. Similar to Bubble Man in Mega Man 2. So we'll go to Proto Man's Castle now. Okay, let's root. Let's rock. Oh, made a huge mistake there already. So remember the tip that I gave you on Napalm Man stage which was to kill those guys from afar if you can. Because they'll pounce right on you.

The super hour is basically just a platform. You can also use it as a weapon if you like. So here we'll use, since we took a bit of damage, we'll draw him out and then we'll get back up there. Grab these things and fill up. So we're back to how we started which is nice. So we use the jet there and then we can use the super hour again. Tons of slowdown. Not going on the screen at once.

Remember if you, with the exception of Mega Man 1, if you grab one of those things they're not going to be there the next time you come through unless... Unless you left it or unless you died since... Man I'm struggling again here. Incredible. Some things were not meant to be my friends. Ah. Man I totally missed time. Alright. This guy just kind of runs around with a shield. He's not really that hard to fight. He does get faster though. As you can see. Fuck. That should do that. Alright so that's the end of him and we'll move on to the next stage in Dark Man's Castle. Or in Proto Man's Castle. I'm sorry. Jeez. So those guys are fatigued I think it's because I did all these Let's Plays back to back to be honest. So those guys will swarm and",

So those guys will swarm and be all on you so you just kind of want to keep moving or deal with them quickly. Remember those mines are going to be there. Just kill that guy for fun. Get rid of the gun. Remember that these guys are going to fire at you. Here we're going to have to be quick footed. So if you mess one of these up like I just did you're going to want to go back down the ladder and just respawn them. Or you can use rush coil if you wanted to. But it's easier to do it that way I think. So this part gets a little hairy. What you could do here. I sometimes sacrifice my life around here to just get these. But you could also just use the super arrow to get through. At least until that point. And then patiently either fire away at these guys or whatever you want to do. Okay. We're good.

We have some more enemies to deal with. Surprisingly a little more difficult this time. Because we're not going to go off the beaten path this time. I did last time. Should be more manageable for you. With the enemies. And here we are. So it's the third iteration of Darkman. And on him we're going to use the driver thing. And remember. So he can stop. He has a time stopper you can avoid though. Unlike centaur mans or whoever else is bright mans. Uh oh. He's going to nail me here. So we'll use the E-tank real quick. As we have quite a few of them.

Glad to hear that. Shrugging a little bit of Mega Man 5. How are you doing with this? I'm okay. I'm getting tired so I'm not playing quite as... That's a cool looking castle. Yeah. Prodmans castle. Yeah I'm not playing quite. I'm fatigued. So I'm losing a little bit of my steam here. As we get towards the end. Well two more levels left then. Right? Alright I got to get through this and then we go to Wily's castle. Not that I want to spoil anything for anyone. So here... This is such a cool design.

We can use Beat here to help us out a little bit. Get him Beat. So as you can see he's like a combination kind of of some of the different dark men that we fought earlier. Should probably use this. Oops a little bit further back to Beat. And Beat will take him out and that's it. The fake Protoman has been exposed and destroyed. Darkman has been destroyed. The real Protoman lives. And you damn well know what's going to happen now. Damn you Wily. Oh shit. That's the castle. Yeah no doubt about it. Okay E-Tank right there. Grab it. Oh that was stupid. Forgot about that.

So we go left. Again these things that you can't destroy. We haven't seen those enemies in a while. But here they are. Remember we still have to fill everything up here. We'll probably use that M-Tank at some point. Let's see. Grab this energy. Use the Super Arrow. Careful to jump there so that you don't hit those spikes. Die instantly. This part gets a little crazy. Here we can use Rush Coil. And then here you want to go up these but not yet. You actually want to destroy this guy over here. And then you can use, because he'll shoot upwards and just knock you off. And then you can use the Rush Coil. And then you can time your jump well enough there, which I didn't.

This is kind of straight out of Dust Man's stage in Mega Man 4. They made it. They might as well use it again. I'm sure it was the rationale behind this particular part of the stage. Slide under. And then get over to the edge quickly and it'll stop. Okay. So we're at the first boss in Wily's Castle. On this guy we're going to use Crystal Eye. Now if you want to be extra judicious with the Crystal Eye here, you can actually use the Pea Shooter to draw those things out. But that's just a little too much menu switching for me. So just one more. That's the end of him. So we move on to the next stage in Wily's Castle. You want to draw him out carefully. Sorry I'm being",

These guys are being very loud too. So I'm sorry about that. I just bleened through. Kevin's losing his mind. Oh, my God. Oh, God, I got to concentrate. I'm leaning forward now. I'm sorry. This is the one. How do I still have eight lives? I feel like I've died like five times. It's really bad. All right. Jeez Louise, I don't know why that was so hard. That's not even where I died before. Careful, very good. OK, we'll leave that there because I'll probably die again. Actually. I think that. What were you?

I think there's no way you may have heard. Oh, you're in it. Oh, yeah, that's right. Actually, I think I knew that. OK, so we're cruising along. More and more further and further. So here we can do a few things. I like to just use power stone. It's it's not the ideal weapon. It doesn't do much damage to them, but you don't really use this weapon any other time. This might be actually the first time you've ever even seen it. And then if you stand to the far right of the screen and use rush yet, you can just go up like this and then jump.

OK, we're almost through. And he's dead. So now we're going. We're almost to the end. I'm sorry that I'm losing energy out there. Very long day. Very tired. You do good, though. Thank you. I appreciate that. Feels nice. You don't have to continue to do that. It is hot. 15 minutes. Anger. No. All right. So here we're going to do with your old Mega Man tradition once more of fighting all the enemies. Did you see this fight, by the way? Gravity Man. I thought you'd enjoy this fight. You. Star man.

Mm hmm. Yeah, they break when you destroy them. Here we'll use charge kick. Remember, you have to sacrifice the body a little bit here. It's like playing a sport and sacrifice the body. Here we'll fight stone man. We'll use napalm bombs on him. Yeah, definitely. He's huge. Just like him. You like it? Napalm man, you're saying? Yeah. So that should be the end of stone man. And then we'll climb back up. We'll fight gyro man, of course. You're going to use gravity hold on him, which is a stupid weapon. I'm good. Thank you. He's a little bitch, though. Star man.

You sound like Bob Ross, but it's fine. Thank you. No, you're just very talented. It's not that easy for us. I appreciate that. You're going to use gyro attack on him, so we're going to finally start using the mystery tank, which will fill up all our weapons. Is it a mystery now? It's not so much a mystery now. It was maybe a mystery at some point. We're all full and we can go to gyro attack. Crystal man is no more. There's only two left. Napalm man. And for napalm man, remember, you're going to use crystal eye. Well, if you were here before, you knew that you were supposed to use the crystal eye.

It's funny, because charge man can be really easy, just depending on what he does. He has a real pattern. I try to stay as far away from him as possible to give yourself enough room to deal with him. And then we are off to wily. It's usually up to his cockpit. But remember, if you hit those spikes, you'll die instantaneously. Of course, this will only be his first form of three. That's why it's so easy. So we'll move on, fight wily two more times. NES? These are all NES. Very good. I agree. Just get through. So here you can use super arrow as a weapon if you want.

Unfortunately, I can't charge my arm cannon while I am using B. So I'm stuck with just pea shooter shots, which is fine. Get him. Get him. I like when he tracks them quickly. It's cool. Just one more just in case. I don't think I'll need it, but you never know. I don't want to make you sit through this again. We're almost there. Hell when he misses. There we go. B. Get him.
