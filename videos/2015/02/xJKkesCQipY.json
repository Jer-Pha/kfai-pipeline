Cool.\nDo you wanna, do you wanna explain it to people a little\nbit? >> Humble Bundle is a service where they\nbundle together a bunch of games for a very, very low price. >> Mm-hm. So it's kind of name your price. And so for this, for, if you just pay\nwhatever you want, you get Star Wars Knights of the Old\nRepublic, Star Wars Jedi Knight, Jedi Academy, or Star Wars Jedi Knight\nJedi Academy, and Star Wars Dark Forces. Then if you go a little over $10 you also\nget Star Wars Battlefront Two, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic Two,\nand Republic Commando. And then for $12 or more you also get\nForce Unleashed. The Ultimate Sith Edition, Force Unleashed\ntwo and Star Wars Emperor at War. So, what's cool about this to me, is that\neveryone's all excited. Star Wars is back, the movie's coming out,",

You could play Snake Eyes or play as Duke\nor whatever, and the game kind of changed\ndepending on who you played as.

TIE Fighter I played a little bit less, cuz they started putting a couple other\ndifferent mechanics in there, and then when. I think it was Dark Force. I have to look this up.Dark Force came out\nand it was the first, first person shooter\ngame they did. It was like, it was like Doom. It was on rails, not, not on rails, but\nyou couldn't.

The biggest piece of shit. I don't, did you guys ever play this game? It was a, it was a randomly generated, we\ngot to look this up and play it. It was fun for like an hour. But it's like a randomly generated like\nlike procedural game. Where like you are Yoda. On a random planet. So it's kinda like isometric remember\ncorrectly. And like you walk around and like do side\nquests. An then like randomly get to go find\nsomething in some place. It's kinda like chips challenge",
