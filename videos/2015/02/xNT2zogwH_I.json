I'm here with world series champion, kind\nof funny family, and Mortal Kombat super fan, Hunter Pence. >> That's me.\nWhat's up? >> So we just got to play some Mortal\nKombat X. Does it feel like Mortal Kombat? >> I mean, what a question. It is Mortal Kombat. It's Mortal Kombat X. It's pretty rad to, to jump into all the characters from you\nknow, my youth that I grew up with. You know the ones that they've announced. There's, there's a lot of them. There's some new ones, which is cool too,\nto throw a new twist. >> Mm-hm. >> But to jump into Scorpion Sub Zero. You know, to see the daughter of Johnny\nCage and Sonya Blade, it's, it's just a- >> Cassie Cage. >> Yeah, Cassie Cage. >> Mm-hm.\n>> But it's the daughter them two, so, it's, it's pretty crazy, and, it\ndefinitely feels it's got the blood, it's got the gore that you remember as a\nkid, and kind of on a whole new level. >> Mm-hm.

So, her specifically, she actually has\ndifferent fighting styles, and all of the characters have. The body style variation. So on the character select screen, you can\nchoose. >> Yeah.\n>> Between three variations. And it's not.\nThey don't all have the standard of things. Where it's not just the, the defensive or\noffensive or whatever. Each character has things that are\ntailored to them. And Cassie specifically has one. That's a little more Sonya, or one that's\na little more Johnny Cage, or one that's a little more in, in between. >> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> What did you think about the different variations for the\ncharacters you play? >> Yeah, I mean, that's that a pretty you,\nthe unique dynamic to add.

Ugh, I have to do one as a zoner, I can't\ndo anything. Or if anyone's in your face, you can't do\nanything. Well now, each character has 3 different\nstyles. So say, if one spell is weaker against,\nyou know, say a zoner or someone's weaker upfront. Or you want to be fast, or you want to be\npowerful, or whatever the case may be. They all have 3 different things, so.

More options make the game more fun, and this is a really cool thing that they've\nput in to this Mortal Combat X. >> Yeah, and another option you got to do\nwas the game mode called Living Towers, which is the new challenge mode of this\ngame. Where you kind of go up the tower, and\nthere's the three different ones. There's the quick, which is kind of you\ngot to do. And then there's the daily ones, which are\nnew ones everyday. And then there's the premier ones, which\nare more themed. So it'll be like holiday specific ones or based on specific Mortal Kombat events and\nall that stuff. We did a little bit of the daily\nchallenges. What do you think about that? >> Yeah, I, it's, it's definitely new and I think anyone that's played Mortal Kombat\nfrom, from back in the day, you remember the towers.

I didn't get to get too it, but there is, they are throwing different\nchallenges at you. >> Yeah.\n>> You're like, you know, you're running through the matches with\nlike bombs being dropped and it could hit anybody, or lasers going\nacross the screen. So. They've thrown some curve balls that we\nhaven't seen before. They give you a lot of opportunities to\nfind the way that you enjoy the game and a, I think it's definitely like a cool\naddition to, a, to Mortal Kombat. >> The coolest thing I think we saw today\nwas the Faction War.
