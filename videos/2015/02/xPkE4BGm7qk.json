Jason Statham you know if you see Jason Statham and trailer it's always bad news for someone yeah whether it be the bad guy is a good guy in this case unfortunately it is the guy who plays the brother as everyone knows of the bad guy from Fast & Furious 6 yes now so what I was thinking about the flashback we're getting a little trickery here because the whole house exploring him getting the phone call obviously this is out of sequence because for anybody that saw fast 6a the credit sequence where we saw this and right behind him",
