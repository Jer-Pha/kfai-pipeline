How the hell does that happen? I mean, I think there was like some sort of wind involved. Maybe he had lighter fluid all over him. I mean, I don't know how his back caught on fire, but basically he he caught on fire. His dad had to like tackle him and like roll him around the beach and it was pretty traumatic for him. And luckily, you know, it didn't go to his head or like burn any of his hair off or anything like that. But like, you know, for listeners on the thing, it's Ramon rubbing Chris's back. Is this Chris, right? Yeah, it's Chris back. You can see the skin is gone. So, he shows up to the one that was calling. This is crazy. So, he shows up uh first day move in day.

I'm going to jump forward a couple pictures so we can go move a little quick. 20. What was it? So this is 30. This is Ramon. I was dressed as Uncle Jess. Now you really look like Drake. Yeah. Oh my god. What's going on with your your chin? I was dressed as white on your chin. I had just uh contrary to what maybe that looks like uh it very much looks like Drake.

And then 31 is so these are couple girls that we met that we knew. You can barely see the girl in the background. Yeah, this is these are two of our friends from college. And then this is, you know, me and and andone selfie like shot that Ramon has his deto a dev tone shirt on here and I have a 311 shirt on here, my graph shirt that I still wear, you know, from time to time.

And um he really loved pushing mine. And you know, we if you can tell like that was just like you can see the rage in my face. I think after that I think I'm wrestling him or something. There's probably a shot of me wrestling him or something.

You have a sheet covering your window. Yeah, I got wires hanging from the hanging from the wall and everything.

Oh, Gavin. um because because he just was a guy that showed up and I guess he lived at his girlfriend's place and I think I saw him once, but he he shared a split room with Dave Smith who was like such a ladies man perpetually bringing in girls like just constantly and but like he more or less had his own room because he shared it with this",

But yeah, Pablo Yeah, Pablo had comical. I mean, I can get into so many great things. I mean, one of the things we were talking about last night is like, you know, Pablo is a sue chef now. And I think at that point he had gone to culinary school. I think maybe in high school, but there were definitely times where, you know, he would make these great dinners, but then like never clean up for like two months from the dinner.

You're talking about boxing a room out. Yeah. Oh my god. This was constant. Yeah. Like it was it was so we you couldn't even box it out. I mean that was the thing. It was insane. And like like I like because the space was literally the size of this table and we would all sit in there like Indian style and smoke and then like you couldn't even like you couldn't breathe like you eventually had to get out of the room like it wasn't even fun. Yeah. Like there were times where I would come over and like I would just be going to hang out with Pablo and his roommate not knowing you were there and you would just like just come out of",

You would like go to the bathroom and I think one time you like you just like went right back in and you were just like, I'm sleeping. I'm not hanging out. And this final picture before I get to a modern day picture of us is uh is Ramon sleeping. This picture is number I would say. Yeah, it probably is. This is Ramon. And the reason I want to show you this picture is because our buddy Chris that we saw before used to bust Ramon's balls about this particular outfit all the time because of the vertical and horizontal stripes which used to drive him nuts. Rightfully so. I mean, horizontal polo vertical. What am I What am I wearing there?",

Having a great good time. That's prebeard, I guess. And that's before I uh decided to get crazy, make some good life choices to be a man Hogan. Anyway, so that's basically I mean, that's just basically a little tour through Ramon and my relationship at Nor Eastern. And I hope you guys enjoyed it.

Uh but we uh we but we had a we had a good time. Like we never hurt anyone. We went to school. Everyone's doing well now and and we went to our classes. Everyone has great jobs now and stuff like that. But it was just a really good I look back very fondly on those days and and uh you know we were comic book characters but like what I realized is that everyone in college was kind of a comic book character. Like when you you want to party and you want to have fun and you want to be a stoner, you want to be you know you want to drink whatever. And that's what we did and we and we had a good time.

That yeah, we really did have a good solid group of friends, you know, um that we're still friends with today. A lot of these guys. So yeah, I mean I remember you saying that freshman year. You would say that, you know, your sisters were always telling you this, you know, like you're going to kind of meet the friends that, you know, or a majority of your friends you're going to meet in college and you probably will stay with friends with them, you know, for the rest of your life.

Uh I talked to a lot of people from college, so um yeah. So anyway, that was a little tour through our friendship and I hope it illuminated to you a little bit as to where Colin comes from. Um, and uh, maybe where here's some of his own psychosis. We talk about Greg's uh, Greg's mentally ill mind, but it's really funny. I mean, honestly, looking at looking at those pictures of you makes no sense to where you're at now. I would have never never I don't see that. I don't see the progression. Exactly.

His time was divided amongst playing video games and school and putting hats in other hats. Yeah, that too. But, you know, he was staying up till all hours at that time. You know, like I said before, I was talking about like I remember what was it like was it Sonic Heroes? Is that what it was called? Yeah. Like Heroes. Yeah. Like you No, but I remember that was a big deal at the time because it was just like so much work that you had to put into it. Meanwhile, you're doing college. Meanwhile, like you got people like me on the floor being like, \"Hey, you want to go smoke weed and like go hang out? You want to come to this party?\" being like, you know, meanwhile you're trying to get actual work",

Even, you know, when was that from 2003? Yeah. Yeah. No, so like 12 years. But um I'm talking about you at IGN. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I mean, well, a year before that is when I started writing for them. But yeah, it was and this is why I think this is instructive is like when you're in college, like, you know, have fun, but find that balance. And I think that's what we all found.

We all found that balance. We all had a good time, but we all did our school work. And I really encourage people to like take school seriously, but don't take it too seriously where you're not having a good time, too. But definitely put one foot in front of the other every day. Get your work done. Yeah. Go to go to class. Don't skip class or whatever. then you can go go and work and make some money or you can go, you know, party with your friends, whatever, and have a good time and do what you need to do. And and and also not, you know, you don't have to drink or smoke to have a good time. You can do that without those substances if you want.

I mean, the one the one thing I know you you mentioned this in a previous episode about, you know, the great thing about Kevin and Chris and myself and you, we all weren't in any classes together. We just kind of formed this bond that is was totally nonrelated to anything that we were studying. I mean, we all had our separate groups of friends, you know, like I had the music kids and, you know, Kevin, you know, was doing engineering and, you know, Chris had his lacrosse and, uh, you know, architecture, you know, dudes and, you know, you had",

Yeah, absolutely. That makes any sense. Yeah. And that's why when I went to Nor Eastern before our Conor Lens meet and greet, I was sad, you know, and I was texting these guys. I was texting the four the three of them. We were texting back and forth. I was texting pictures and stuff and I'm like, I'm nostalgic. I'm happy to be back here, but I'm filled with a profound sadness, you know, because like we really will never get these days back ever again. Like, we'll never be able to do this again, you know?

I remember like this that and the other thing that happened in Willis when people, you know, people Ari would knock on the door and people would be throwing their beer bottles out of the window and and like that. Like I remember like all these things that were happening and it's like man like there's a it sounded at the time it was so scary but it was really innocent and it it it is of a place in time that you will just only be able to remember. You'll never be able to relive it, you know? And uh that's why I'm like that's why I always encourage people I'm like go to college and go away to college. You know what I mean?

And yeah, so I'm glad to give people a little glimpse in a younger Colin. I thought I thought it would and Raone of course I thought it would give people you know people get a kick out of that because we all come from these kind of more humble and silly roots I think. And even though I have like this more serious demeanor on the internet sometimes like I partied with the rest of them, you know what I mean? And had a good time with that. Work hard, play hard. Yeah, absolutely. So there that's it. That's uh that's that. [Music]",
