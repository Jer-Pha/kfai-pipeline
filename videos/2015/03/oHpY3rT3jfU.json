Yeah, that'll be weird, right? Um, Star Wars. A lot of a lot of talk today. Today they talked about uh we'll give away when we're filming it, but that they're releasing a canon book after. So expanded universe is no longer canon, right? Um but they're going to release a book that is canon that will explain what happened between the end of Jedi when the second Death Star was destroyed and the beginning of Force Awakens episode 7, which I'm very excited about. I will read that immediately. Um and I'm because I'm super because there are already a billion books about what happened after Jedi with Grand Animal Thron and stuff. So I'm interested to see like what ideas whatever are in there. But anyway, this brought me to a different idea which was and it's a more simple idea and it can be for all six movies.

No. Does W not make the No, defin Yeah. Well, Anakin. Okay. Okay. Anakin. Um, so that would be I think pretty much everyone you would consider like maybe a protagonist at some point in the in in in the and some of them turn into antics. Queen Amadala. Uh, yeah. Amadala would be one. Qui-Gon Jin. And Qui-Gon would be another one. That's true. And did you say quad? Wad. Wad. Yeah. That's that's the horrible anti-Semitic like Yeah. Oh, yeah.

I was like, no, there's someone I would rather be. But but I don't I don't really I don't actually really even know the answers.

But Han, when you start unpacking Han, his life kind of sucked. Like he's kind of living with his pet. He's got his ship. They have a life smuggle stuff. I wouldn't call him a pet. Well, you know what I mean? Like you look at you look at all their lives and you know Han's kind of self-destructive in a little ways.

And you know what actually this discussion what we just this is what made the initial three movies so good is that yes there was this grand big epic narrative but there's this far more interesting downto- earthth you know with the criminality and everything like that that that you know really kind of kept the characters going whereas like you you look at the more recent three and it's like everyone just seems so small and just this kind of a caricature against this kind of big obvious background.

I've actually up until this point never actually started thinking about the psyche or or the the flaws of the characters in Star Wars before.

And then you've got Han who is basically for all intents and purposes a criminal. He's a smuggler and a criminal and and and and not a very good guy who then has to come to terms with the fact that and Obi-Wan's just a fanatic and OB Yeah.

I mean, you you think of all of those that it didn't have that kind of substory that was more original that that that could bring out characters cuz I've always blamed just like he wrote crappy characters in in in the one through three, but it really could be like he gave no space for characters to emerge cuz what he was doing was just so sort of mythological and epic that it's a story that sounds better being told after the fact than actually watching it happen and play out in front of you.

Is this caring time? Also also it's the one of the hardest things to do is write a character that is your protagonist that becomes the antagonist in a different story. That's not easy. Very few people can do that. In fact, the only person I can really think of that's really great at doing that is guy is like um uh Martin, George R. Martin, like where he'll write a character that starts so innocent and so amazing and turn them into a wicked human being, but you sympathize and you find that thing in you that would have done the exact same thing. That's what he needed to do with Anakin. And that felt so far short that it left you",

Another great example of it, right, where Walter White where you're like, he started off doing, this character started off with great intentions and then we follow him into this downward spiral, you know, the road the hell is paved with good intentions and that's where he started going. And we never got that with Anakin. Anakin just literally flips a switch and that's it. He had a bad dream and in order not to uh have that dream become reality, I have to commit mass genocide of all of the Jedi, including the little kids, the young Padawan. Well, things happen.

So, I think that there's a lack of focus that like pretty much precludes all of those all the characters cuz they even ruin Obi-Wan in those and ruin Obi-Wan and actually in the prequel in the trilogy because of how [\u00a0__\u00a0] awful he is in the prequels.

Why did it transition?\" It was at least getting you ready. He still wasn't at full potential. But see, that was why those movies were so good. They had those layers, right?
