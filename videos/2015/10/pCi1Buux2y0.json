Are we ending it already? But I think this should end in a trilogy. Yeah, just this is it, the final episode of PS I Love You XOXO. That's a bold move. It is a bold move, but I like making bold moves. Is it because finally after three weeks we've been dethroned at the top of the iTunes podcast charts? Have we? Car Talk is once again number one. Those motherfuckers at Car Talk. The crazy thing about Car Talk as far as I understand it, those are two brothers. That's a great show. Have you ever listened to Car Talk? I wish you nothing but the best. I don't know anything about Car Talk. Sure. Or Cars rather. I know a lot about Car Talk. Okay. Car Talk is a show it's been on for many years, like decades. And it's by two brothers in Massachusetts. And one of them died like a few years ago. And I think that the Car Talk",

That's the opposite way of what we're doing. Oh, it's fine. We released a song and we became the number one video games podcast and hobbies or whatever the hell the thing is. And we were up there with a song, episode one, episode two, and now Car Talk and Hunt the Truth are back up there. Even though I'm interested about this truth. I don't care about the truth. The...

They just like have this great banter with each other. Very witty dudes. But I think one of them passed away. That throws off the banter for sure.

Whatever. I'm going to play it on PS four, but I'll play it via remote play because with the PlayStation Vita, of course, every PlayStation four game is a Vita game. That's what I've been told. And I was like, perfect. Turn it on immediately. The text is too small. It's hurting my eyes trying to read all the time. Text. I'm like, I can power through this though.

It's cause I couldn't stick to the wall correctly cause of the damn back touch got mad. And Kevin said, I don't understand why they didn't just put triggers on the back of the two triggers on the Vita. And I said, they want to get these kids with their touchscreen gaming, all this other stuff. And then your argument is that when the Vita came out, PS3 was still a thing. Obviously designed to be used in conjunction with PS4. We just didn't know that yet. Right. People weren't using the triggers on PS3. So it didn't seem, I don't think it was that obvious of a choice at that time. People use R1 and L1 to shoot in most PS3 games, at least early and mid PS3 games",

People use R1 and L1 to shoot in most PS3 games, at least early and mid PS3 games made by the end people. But a lot of people weren't using the triggers. Everyone hated them. You, in fact, a lot of people would remap the L1 and R1. Games like Uncharted were used natively L1 and R1 as opposed to L2 and R2, which is the standard now in the Nathan Drake collection. You can switch them. And my thought was that it wasn't a priority for them because, A, they might be telegraphing moves in the future by including triggers. Then people like, why are you putting triggers on Vita when your triggers on your PS3 controller suck? And then like, why don't you fix the PS3 controller? And so I think that their solution at the time was that, you know, the studios will map as some studios have. Like when you put Far Cry 4 in, for instance, there's a, it knows that you're connected to Vita",

Like when you put Far Cry 4 in, for instance, there's a, it knows that you're connected to Vita and it shows you an image of how to play the game. So my argument was simply that there was no need to put two sets of triggers on the Vita because no one knew at the time that they're going to be using a system that actually had competent triggers in association with the Vita. See, my problem is I just, I think this goes back to our whole Stockholm syndrome when we talk about the XMB and printer settings and everything else. It's like, yeah, sure. We use R1 and L1 to shoot and stuff, but I remember everyone going like, why is this happening? Why? Anyone who ever used an Xbox is like, why are we using these triggers? Not to mention if there's already, I mean, I don't think you're telegraphing anything by putting just, we're making it look like the DualShock. You don't have to use the, you",

I don't even understand ergonomically how the triggers would fit. It would not well. You'd have to have a deeper. The Vita couldn't sit. Like, right? Like it would be pitched. I think it would be, I think it would be a thicker design is the problem. That's the biggest problem. Yeah. But I think I would, I would have fucking much rather than ditch all this touchscreen garbage that just was a fad that didn't work out and done it there.

The way you save and use like the different like infrastructure of the Vita, I think works fine with the touchpad. I don't think you'd get rid of touch. I think that would be really a stupid idea. Everyone, everything is, everything's touched on, on that kind of screen these days. The back touch, yeah, I think they should absolutely get rid of them. I'm surprised they haven't yet.

And so it was this, this machine that made a lot of sense then didn't make a lot of sense to a lot of people. Then maybe phones were killing it. Then it made a lot of sense when the PS4 was announced and they integrated and I was like, that's awesome that they did that. And, and it's still to a lot of people doesn't make sense. I think when I think again, what we're talking about when I'm talking about touch screen, right, is that I would have much rather from the get go that not been a thing.

Make a system for gamers like they do with the PlayStation four and then watch it succeed. I don't know. I personally, sunflowers and all this other garbage. Sure. Sunflower is a good game. Good game. But I mean, it's clearly a touch. It's an iPhone game. But the the I don't I disagree completely that removing the front touch screen would have made Vita sell better.

So the price drop is official. Now, people note that the price drop is vacillated in Canada. That is based on, of course, the weak Canadian currency. You can't really blame Sony for that. Otherwise, there's really nothing else to say. There's a series of bundles. Some bundles will cost more, as I said. So do keep an eye on that. Yeah.

I think it's an appropriate price, more than an appropriate price. Call of Duty was the other one. Three hundred forty nine dollars is a steal for PS4. I think PS4 is really a dynamic system and has a great library already. So if you're waiting for more of a price drop, you're not going to see it anytime soon at all.

Number two. Greg, would you believe it if I told you that 80% of PlayStation 4 owners have never played Uncharted? Yeah, I think it sounds high, but I believe it. Naughty Dog community manager, Eric Monicelli, a friend of ours, told MCV that the studio, quote, did a lot of research and discovered that about 80% of the people that own a PS4 have never played Uncharted, period. That was one of the reasons we thought remastering it would be a good idea. The other reason is we decided we wanted to do it, especially when we got the Last of Us remastered done. We thought, oh man, this would be cool if we could go back, end quote. As for the studio's future, Monicelli stated that they're working on one game at a time these days.

That's important because they did split into two at one point and worked on the Last of Us at the same time as Uncharted 2 and then Uncharted 3. But he says, as for the studio's future, Monicelli stated that they're working on one game at a time these days with all hands on deck for Uncharted 4 and then Uncharted 4's DLC.

I think that was tongue in cheek on his part. Although they did, you know, prototype Jack and Daxter 4 back in the day. The Last of Us 2 is the obvious target.

In other words, the profit margin is the same, whether they fund it themselves or whether the people buy it ahead of time, they're going to make the same amount of money anyway. It's just, the argument doesn't really make much sense when you think about it in that respect. You understand what I'm saying? Like say there's 10,000 people that are interested in this game. Say 10,000 of them therefore go to Kickstarter and raise, I don't know, a few hundred thousand dollars to localize whatever fucking Japanese game. That's not worth it for Square getting that money ahead of time anymore than it would have been",

But here's the thing I think you're missing. Are they double dipping? It might just be that you're paying for localization and you're buying the game on top of it. I'm sure. No, but that's exactly what it is. But the point is that those 10,000 people exist and they're going to buy the game and if you make it for them, then other people are certainly going to buy it. So whether you Kickstarter or fund it yourself, the overhead is the exact same and the profit margin is the same. It's not mitigating risk for a company.

Yeah, they would look terrible doing it and what you're talking about are the financials. No matter what, they're not making a gajillion dollars off of this. The one point he makes that I think is very interesting for at least Square Enix's pipeline is that, and I think this is kind of, he doesn't say it explicitly, but he does say it, he doesn't apply it, is that when they start making a game in pre-pro or when they start making a game, there's already a localization pipeline for it. So in other words, they know well before they announce that these games are coming west, that they're coming west. And that's not a huge surprise, but he says, let me see if I can find it.

Saying it's already been closed when we know there's going to be in there. So what he's saying is that, from what I mean, he's not saying it, so what I think he's saying is that they know or they don't know. Like Dragon Quest is coming out for instance this week, Dragon Quest Heroes, the Musou from Omega Force, and that's coming out here and it won't probably sell that well here, but they already knew that they were going to translate it.

It's not as easy as finding someone that speaks Japanese and English and then translating it. The translation is the easy part. You got to go through and remove jokes that don't make sense to an American audience, put in a joke that makes sense, remove something that's culturally relevant to Japan, put in something that's culturally relevant to the Westerners. Right. It's complicated. People that localize are really writers. They're not just translating.

And they get, you know, some money on the back end. But there's pitfalls. There's an opportunity cost to this. The opportunity cost isn't only that if the voice actors don't get their deal that we're going to lose talent. There's going to be a brain drain in the industry because there certainly will be.

He's films for a month and there are three weeks and he's gone. Meanwhile, the guys that made the sets are there for months. The guys that edited, blah, blah, blah. They don't get paid nearly as much. I'm like, he's the star and he's the draw. You guys worked hard behind the scenes, but no one knows who Joe Schmo, you know, the grip is.

And so it's just the unfortunate reality of the situation. I wish that we treated game developers like the rock stars that they are, but they're just not. And there's some corollary, like some precedent to in TV and movies and stuff where it's like the star of the show is the star of the show.

Maybe we will, maybe we won't. And they went back and forth and finally they were like, we're not going to give you any more. You know what I mean?

I hope that the developers and publishers can come together and treat the developers better, too. That said, developers do make, you know, developers at AAA Studios do make a lot of money in a lot of them. So it's not like they're not compensated.

Yes. Your next question is to choose from gaming media versus actually playing games. A tough time. Xbox One versus PlayStation 4 in 2016. Gaming media. What does that mean? Can you clarify what that means before I make a choice? Consuming gaming media. Oh no I don't want to do that. Okay. PS4 versus Xbox One sounds good to me. Matty Mayhem went over to kindofunny.com slash PSQ and said, Hey Colin and Greg. Hello. I have a friend that's trying to decide between Xbox One and PS4 and I'm not sure how best to advise him. PS4. Thank you Matty Mayhem for your question. In the past I would have told him if you liked RPGs to go PlayStation if you liked first person shooters to go",

PS I love you. PS I love you. XOXO. Continue the great content and all hail shoe. My honest assessment of this question is that I'm not sure you can go wrong with either choice. Yeah. I think that Xbox One has a vibrant a growing vibrant ecosystem of indie games which I really like and are engendering that relationship with ID at Xbox and they have Phil Spencer kind of leading the helm and he's doing right and making all the right moves and saying all the right things.

I would suggest PS4 because that's just more where I'm happy and more I'm happy where I'm more comfortable and it's also a more vibrant system. It's selling better so it's engendering more support. I think that that could be a snowball effect for Sony in two three four years where there are more games there are better games. The games do run better typically on PlayStation four as it's more powerful hardware. Technically I don't know anything about that. You just see a lot of the resolution shit where it's like even with I think was it Battlefront or something. It was like it's running a nine hundred P on PS4 and 720 P so it's even getting lower now as opposed to 1080 versus nine hundred.

I think what it comes down to is first and second party support because I actually think that the third party sports pretty much the same maybe with some resolution or frame rate differences. These aren't nerds they won't catch that. So I think that you have to look at the exclusives. Yep. And I think that Xbox's exclusives look great this fall and look great next year. What's after that? I don't know. Sony has a very much more vibrant and I think much more stacked ecosystem of first parties and second parties. What are you looking forward to in the future?

The brilliance is that there's enough to be happy with with both of those consoles. I think the future might look a little different depending on how things pan out because I didn't include the story but the Phil Spencer quote. Ah yes. That we talked about where he basically admitted like Sony has a huge lead. I think that was his words like you know hugely then they don't know if they're gonna ever catch up. That will have financial ramifications. I mean look at end game ramifications like a Wii U. I'm not saying Xbox One is gonna sell like Wii U. It's certainly not.

And it's the same thing. So if the trend continues and PlayStation really buries Xbox One which is possible but unlikely I think then the PlayStation 4 might be a long game support. You know like where it's like four or five years from now PS4 might look a lot better. But let's not forget and I keep saying this and I think people are understating the importance of this Xbox 360 was eating PlayStation 3's lunch for years years you know and came out a year earlier and was destroying it and PlayStation 3 ended up winning at the end.

I'm not going that far will remake them. I mean, where we that's why I'm pulling it back. He started with remaster. We're doing remaster.

I know it can't happen, but if the union, I mean, I was gonna say I can't believe that an infamous game never came to Vita. I thought that was a fucking slam dunk. I mean, if you talk about bets, we would have bet the house on and lost the house. Thank God we can't buy this house. We would have all I was so, of course, there's going to be a war. I thought we're a slam dunk. They put coal in PlayStation, all stars battle royale. Of course, there's going to be an infamous game. I remember saying that. Of course.

Somebody's working on an infamous Vita game. Come the fuck on. It's unfathomable. It wouldn't have mattered. We got to get Jackie Trenton on the show. He'll know. Yeah. I wonder what Jack Trenton's NDA is up. Probably never. Jack Trenton has a fucking 10,000 year NDA. I like that man. Hey Greg, we're really excited about the PlayStation ecosystem.

What do you bring to the table this week? I was going to go so deep that I was going to come out the other end of the earth. So I decided not to do that. Instead I'm settling on a little game called mushroom wars. Mushroom wars. I do remember mushroom wars. Mushroom wars at one time I think would have been on our top 25 PS3 games. It was. When we were at it on a long time ago. Mushroom wars is a fun little PS3 downloadable game. It's like a real time tower defense kind of game, like a strategy game.

Well anything with mushrooms is psychedelic bro. Hey man. So it's just I won't say much more about it. It's a great game. Yeah. Go back and play it. Put in your PlayStation 3. Dust it off. Download mushroom wars. Give it a go. I think you'll enjoy it. That would have been a game that would have really been nice on Vita as well. But you know it's so long in the old forgotten kind of game. But I actually think it did pretty well. People played that game. Yeah I remember. But that was because I think the pool was so much smaller or shallow I guess in that argument. Sure. So I gave a shout out to Vita two weeks ago. You gave a shout out to PS3 last week. I'm gonna",

So I'm giving the geed forever. Let us change our name shoe. Hey, I'm giving the geed. No, I'm going to call bullshit on that name because I'm not being selected because that's an that's an obscure word that your friends made up. No one will know, but that's not the point of it.

Would it, it would ruin my, my trophy ego a little bit, but are we getting the trophies to stack them? Are we getting the trophies? Cause we like to get them. That was like one of the kind of the philosophical questions I was, I was coming down to like, I look at my trophies actually. And I'm like, I would delete half of these if I could see something. I even with the 0% ones, I don't delete them. I like seeing what I did or when I'm like, oh, I popped it in for a let's play or did this. And we never did.
