I'm here with one half of the coolest dudes in video games, Colin Morardi. Thanks. I don't I'm not comfortable with that term because I feel like it puts too much pressure on me.

The reason we get to do the show is because of cool cool help from people that are supporting cool things like Crunchyroll. I'm a big fan of Crunchyroll. We a couple weeks ago we were talking about them. They're an anime site. to do a bunch of they have so much anime, even uh Attack on Titan, which is the one I recommend. So, you guys should definitely check that out. Hit me up on Twitter. Let me know what you think about it. If you go to crunchyroll.com/kindfunny, you can get a 30-day free trial of Crunchyroll Premium. What does that allow you? You ask, Colin. Yes, it allows you It gives you uh zero ads, 1080p quality, which is the only way to roll. I don't go for anything anything",

Um, and even the shows that are airing in Japan right now, like Fairy Tale with a boy, Michael Jones, over at Rooster Teeth does a voice for that. Um, if it comes out in Japan, we get it here within an hour. Oh, wow. That was pretty good. Pretty good. Professionally subtitled. I don't know. Time magic. I don't know. I don't know. They do. They do really good stuff. So, again, crunchyworld.com/kindfunn 30-day trial. You should do that. Watch Attack on Titan. Let me know what you think about it. I actually really like Crunchyroll. I legit use them. So that's kind of smart. I like I can sit through ads but 1080 I' I'd pay for a good 1080 quality if I'm watching through like a whole season like I'm I'm committed. Yeah.

I I spent quite a bit of time with those guys as they were rolling things out because obviously I was our PlayStation editor at IG as they were rolling out. Yeah. Rolling things out. And uh you know I went out to lunch with them and I saw their office stuff. There really is like an authentic passion for like anime. Like their thing is it's made it's anime stuff by fans for fans and you can and you could totally and you could totally see that. I actually really appreciated them. They were fun to work with. That's cool. And then the the other thing is our boy Peach Goblin poop. Yay. Alfredo's Peach Goblin poop. Yes. He has his new Simple Mind EP. We've talked about it before. Definitely check it out.

Do you know? No, I don't. I I will one day ask him, but you know, he's a pretty chill dude until he spills your drink on yourself. Yeah. Wait, spills your drink on yourself? He spilled your drink on you. Yeah, he my drink on me. All right. I understand what you're saying. I understand what you're saying. What them peach goblins do, I guess. It's either pooping or that.

And then and then it it's like the when when you know Puff Daddy became Diddy. Yeah. It's just an iteration. He just he's doing things. I mean, he really is the Diddy of our generation. If you think about it, it's like when you make a gamer tag, but it's taken so it suggests a bunch of different names. Like, oh, maybe you want peep goblin poop to the end of it. I like that. That's good. Instead of numbers, they should just add poop. And and then the final thing, Dan, you're working on something. Yes, worked on it. It's done. The work's done. Oh my god.

Mostly video game related, but we uh we go off topic a lot. Um sounds familiar. Yeah. But yeah, it's like my my whole career it's just been very very jokey and very silly and stuff and I wanted to kind of test some range or whatever and talk about something serious and for 12 years I've had anxiety disorders and for somebody that's frequently in front of a microphone or in front of cameras or crowds or whatever, it's been an interesting",

And over 12 years, I've gotten much much better with managing anxiety through just a lot of different things I learned work and what doesn't work. And so I wrote a book about it. So it's just like it's 70% kind of like a autobiography chronicle of those 12 years, 30% kind of self-help, like the methods I found that really do help out with it. And you know, without these methods, I wouldn't be able to be on podcasts or do panels of packs or whatever. And I just wanted to help people out with that cuz when I was 18 and first started struggling with it, I didn't know what it was, you know? I didn't know how to talk to people about it. I didn't know anybody else with this issue. So, I I wanted there to be a book out there that wasn't from some like self-help guru, Tony",

So, if you just search Amazon for Anxiety as an ally, you'll find it. And uh yeah, it's been out for about a week now. It's doing great. Feedback's been awesome. So, uh, yeah, definitely check that out. And Kevin, can you make a note to like Thank you.

So yeah I mean even if it's pretty severe like it was when I was 18 19 20 like that stuff can get you can get over that stuff if you use the right methods and stuff.

Uh, when you think about the launch titles for PlayStation devices, um, I actually think that, and I've said this before, I think VA actually had the strongest launch lineup of any PlayStation device. But, um, when you go back to think about PS1, you had things like Toshin Den and some real just like some [\u00a0__\u00a0] Disruptor was an early game. Uh, but there wasn't like a lot of uh, Disruptors Insomniac's first game, by the way, in case people are curious. But, um, there wasn't a lot there wasn't an established first party at that point. So, that that's not a good example. Then PS2 had a lot of games but a lot of random games. Phantom Vision was an internal game tag tournament time. Yep.

And I don't think that good games really start like really good games really started to come to the console until you got Anusha and a few like it took a while in my opinion. But it had some it had some 7.5 and eights. Yeah. launch 7.5s or eights, you know what I mean? Like it was in the summer that you started seeing like Gran Turismo 3 and Twist Metal Black and then obviously later you had like Metal Gear 2 and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. By the time PS3 rolled around, First Party was more um was going a little harder. Insomniac on a first party studio, but Resistance is an exclusive. That was a launch style. They had Motorstorm from Evolution, I think before they even owned Evolution. Um so things got",

Um so things got things were kind of weak. PSP had a pretty decent launch lineup, too. Um, and then I think VA had a really strong launch line, but I think PS4's was pretty good. And I don't know if you guys agree with that. I think that Knack wasn't a good game, but Killzone was a nice game to launch with. Killzone Shadowfall. Reszle Gun is still, I think, the best game on the console, and that was a launch game. Um, and there was a few others. So, when I think about the the the perfect launch lineup for PS5, let's say comes out 2021, right? I mean, like, it's going to be a pretty long time, right? Um, you would want to think that they would have something like Uncharted ready. And I I think that even though they are going to leave Uncharted, I think after Uncharted 4, I think it would be time to maybe reboot",

And Uncharted, I think with the exception of Gran Turismo is and maybe God of War is probably their biggest franchise. So I think you would want to have something from that. And and even though they they won't give up the Killzone Ghost. So um you want to let go of that. And then it's funny because on Colin and Greg today, uh Dan and I were talking about the Getaway a little bit and it wouldn't it be awesome. I really loved the Getaway on PS2. I think that was a really special game. It was a little under it was a little undercooked. Um, but it was a special game.

And I can't when when you brought this question I was like that would be one that I would bring back. That would be an IP I'd bring back. The Getaway um I think would be um really really really cool. And then uh I would bring back Resistance. I think it's I think at that point you Resistance had been dead for a long time and you and you reboot it and give it maybe to another studio. I don't think Insomniac would want to do it anymore. So I think if you look at for PS5 I think a strong launch lineup for of three exclusives would be Resistance maybe just call it Resistance Fall of Man again. Um you have the Getaway and you just",

I don't know how you guys feel about that, but I mean, do you think Uncharted is a launch game? I think that if I think that if The Last of Us wasn't so late in the PS3 generation, I think Sony would have fallen over itself to have Uncharted as a launch game, you know what I mean? So, I think it's just a matter of like what's ready to go. Infamous was supposed to be a launch game and so so was Drive Club. So, it's just a matter of what was available at the time.

And I think it's still the most console quality game on the platform and still one of the best games on the platform. So I think it you it couldn't hurt. That game also sold over a million copies on on VA. You know, for me, I think that like no matter the system, whether it's Xbox, Nintendo, or PlayStation, gone are the days of Mario 64 where it's like you're getting that one title that's just amazing and that's the reason you buy the system. They're always every launch is just going to be the here's 10 games. They're okay. Three of them are sports games. You have one racing game. Yeah, exact.

So, I don't think we'll ever get that a real Uncharted, like a real Mario launch game again, you know? Like when's the last We never got that. I I think the last time you got like a absolute classic as a launch title might have been the first Halo. Trying to think of like something on that level of Mario 64, Mario World. Yeah.

Like that new audience that the Wii brought in. But also me, like I liked playing it. That was the fun thing in college like after the bars, we'd come back and do Wii bowling and Wii tennis. But then you also had Zelda. Yeah. So you you've got that one two punch of like the most casual and the most like gamers game, you know? They did a good job with that. Yeah, I think the Wii was a pretty solid launch overall. It was, but it was because of what was bundled in with it.

Um I I just I I understand what you guys are saying, but I do question the wisdom in why you can't have it both ways that if like a console like the first parties have access to these consoles very early. I know that we all know that, right? Like Shadowfall didn't just come from Guerilla. Shadowfall is in development since like 2010, you know? So like they they knew what was what was happening.

And like I I think that's obviously an overstatement. There are lots of games on PlayStation 4 that I think are worth playing that are fun. But I think that Bloodborne might be the first one that's really really really a system seller. Like authentically a system seller. I actually bought a PS4 because of Bloodborne. Yeah.

Vita did give us that game right off the bat. It didn't work obviously. But so, it's, you know, when a game like Infamous comes out, Second Sun is, I think, the worst Infamous game. It's a it's a it's a good game. I liked it. It was just a little under again undercooked and I don't know, kind of empty. Um, so if it's not ready to go, don't put it out. Why can't why not prepare a great AAA launch exclusive? Why not, you know, and then you can you can still have that game a year, 18 months out like Bloodborne.

It's not going to happen. So, it's it's it's the the die is cast.

Not making the argument that re-releasing these old games takes away from those ideas, but it certainly takes away from the marketing budget for those ideas. It certainly takes away from money spent on those ideas from publishers that are also paying for the re-releases. I just like anything else, I do feel like it's becoming too much.

Um, I thought you were talking about the Twist Middle Black character. No, no, no, no. Okay.

Um, at some point, I think in 2009, they released, or maybe 2010, they released a game called Singularity. Um, and I really liked that game. Singularity was very different for an Activision published game because Activision's all about annualization. Activision is all about making money, and that's their right, and they do it very well.

So, I talked Jeff Gersman, my boss, into doing it. So, if you search like giant bomb roller coaster on YouTube, you'll see it. And so, we got uh we downloaded Mario 3 on our 3DS's. We set up two wristbands for it so it wouldn't fly away. Also taped two wristbands. Yeah. Also, we taped we taped the 3DS's to our hands. We had GoPros on our chest, GoPros on the seats in front of us. I talked Six Flags into letting us go before the park opened. And we went on the Medusa roller coaster up here in Valo.
