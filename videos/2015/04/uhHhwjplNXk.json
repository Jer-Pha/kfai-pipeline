I think trailer is usually when there's actual when you hear dialogue that's straight from the movie of characters talking in it, whereas teaser is if it's just VO and stuff. Interesting. I would go as far as to say a trailer has plot exposition in it where you're actually getting like a feel for what the whole flow of the first and second and potentially depending on the trailer third and the sequel like you know most trailers just show you exactly like there how many trailers have you seen where you're like is that the last shot of the movie and then you should make a movie trailer we should make a movie trailer that spoils the sequel that's really funny I like that so I feel like real quick before we get into Star Wars in",

It was about like the the joke of the movie was they're bringing back the movie voice and she was the first she wanted to be the first ever female VO. Her her dad's the movie. Her dad is the movie guy. Yeah. Um sorry. Anyways, back to Star Wars. Every little thing she does. You and McGregor and Renee Zo in The Case of Too Many Tombstones. Oh my god, it's so funny. Wow.

They did a video like to open the Oscars where the movie voice guy was in like a limo and he was going around picking up the other five voice people and they picked up the the guy that does the Disney voices and then he did the the guy that does the like commercial voices and stuff and they're all in the back of the limo talking to each other and it's so funny cuz he's like, \"No, you're doing it wrong.

It's not the train wreck that the first two are. No, no, it's not. I think the biggest problem with the prequels is that those movies weren't made to make good stories, make good movies.

When I first saw the Vader mask in the trailer, that was the first time so far that I've been like hm I don't know if we need that. That makes sense because think about Vader as a martyr. If he were the leader, if he were your, if it was General Patton and he died, there would be a cult around that guy, like he would be a martyr. Like, think about it. I don't know. We don't have generals necessarily that are that like visual like Norman in the in in the mainstream, but now go back to",

We're behind these guys. were pushing forward with this tremendous amount of energy to win this war. So, think about that. Like, no one knew Vader was a good guy at the end. There's three people that were in that room at the end. Mhm. Mind you, there was maybe a couple storm troopers that were like, \"What's that dude doing like carrying Vader under that ship? That's kind of weird because he was like dragging him for like half a mile, probably using the Force to carry his body because it looked pretty heavy.

I just like I before I saw the trailer uh and I love like that's great. It is a great story. I just I'm shocked that that Vader even has anything to do with it. I would have thought they would have just left it let that be completely and just moved on. Yeah, I I I I hear what you're saying, but it is it is really fascinating to think that Vader has like a cult of personality now. That's like that's actually like when I saw that I was like that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome because you were reading the rumors about and I might be mixing up the rumors now or whatever but like I was reading things my brother was telling me about things about that female stormtrooper officer Fasma I think her name is is like obsessed with Darth Vader apparently and like that",

And Mark Hamill, I think he can get the job done, but I just don't know if they're going to come back and be those characters again. And I mean that in such that like when Harrison Ford reprised his role as Indiana Jones, it was really hard for me personally to not see Harrison Ford. It's just Harrison Ford playing Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Versus when I watched it when I was a kid, I really knew who Harrison Ford was. That was just Indiana Jones.
