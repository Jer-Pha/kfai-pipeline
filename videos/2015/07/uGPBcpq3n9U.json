Thank you so much for supporting us at patreon.com/kindfunny. It allows us to do all of this crazy stuff. My final topic here today. This came to me last night in a fever dream. I don't know if I had a fever, but I had a dream one of these and I looked over and Christine's body had Portilla's head and I was like, I'm perfect. It's perfect. Finally. Um, get the loop. Why'd you got to take it to it? I'm sorry, guys. You're just a monster. My filter's gone. Have you noticed that? No. Never noticed. My like what? I bet like it's so funny because I remember the I remember the first time someone left a comment on one of these videos like wow Nick's swearing a lot more now and now I think people have just accepted the fact that I'm deranged. Yeah, they get it. They know who you are. I also want to give a quick shout out to Kevin who looks like he just came",

It's the art of fighting by uh on the beach by swinging your legs around in little tiny shorts. Eddie Gordo. Eddie Gordo did it. Tekken 3. Okay. Yeah. Did you know that Scorpion and Subzero are brothers? I did, Greg. Just let you know. I did. My topic was is I want to know and this we've done things similar to this, but it's very specific. What you'd want to go back and experience again for the first time if and so like and I don't mean like go back and like right now like you forget what chocolate ice cream tastes like and somebody gives you chocolate ice cream.

No, I was thinking I had a dream about uh WWF attitude era and like watching that and I forget what it was about the rock and mankind or whatever. And then I woke up in the middle of like 3:00 a.m. or whatever from this dream and I was like, \"Shit, I would love to go back and rewatch that stuff because it's one of those things now.\" You know, I just got that Attitude Era book out there that John Robinson, our friend, wrote, former colleague, former ESPN writer, wrote uh about the Attitude Era and all this different stuff.

I'm like this is perfect. This is perfect. And like from then on I was like I knew that that they perfected Mario and I'm like holy crap this thing that I loved is now perfect. Mh. Um, and moments though, I think that overall I think a lot of my the things that I wish I could experience again, like go back into those moments, a lot of them were friends-based and like um I'm trying to think like merchandise based.
