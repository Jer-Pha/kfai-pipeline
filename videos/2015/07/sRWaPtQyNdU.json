The first movie is [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome and it's takes too long to get into it. So, it's not like you don't really see much of Scarecrow, which is why like they that they inject him in every movie, even though like like in the very beginning he just gets arrested, but like he's there. But it reaffirmed straight up and I'm just going to say that Dark Knight Rises is the best of those three movies. And I'm going to tell I'm going to tell you why that is. Okay, it's because it the middle movie is a reflection of what happens somewhat in the first movie, but it really is a standalone title in its own way. And Batman Begins and Dark Knight",

And Batman Begins and Dark Knight Rises touch each other in like very in many ways like intimately. Yeah. Like it's cool how they they use that movie actually to wrap things up. And it's the darkest one. It's the one with I think still the best story and and like the most meaningful plot which is like basically just it it's so clearly inspired by Occupy Wall Street. I think in in a lot of ways when you really look at it like I think I think it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] obvious is The Day is long that that's what the inspiration for it was. So, I just was I just wanted to say that even though I like Bane and and obviously the second one's great. It's a great film.

My assumption, I was talking to Charl about this, is like I don't I don't know enough about Nolan's process or the process between like having to reddraft that that third movie, which they clearly probably had to do. Um, but my assumption is that Bane was still the bad guy and it was still going to go along at that point and when they break everyone out of Black or whatever it was or Yeah, that's that's where it is, right? That's the prison versus Arkham the the asylum. So yeah, so Black Gate was what they broke out theoretically. Joker was presumably going to be in there, right?

Right. Right. And be ultimately Bane would probably die and then ultimately he would be the the guy that they had presumably. But it would have been really interesting. It would be interesting to go back and I I doubt that Nolan would ever maybe he has given interviews about this but it' be interesting to talk to him like 10 years from like hey had that unfortunate event not happened like what would that have been? I want to say he has he must have at some point. I mean to to me like I would have kind of leading with a fresh villain is",

You're not going to be able to come close to what they accomplished in the Dark Knight. And so like having Bane come in as a as a more interesting kind of more physical villain was I think was a good choice. Um, having said that, I don't know anyone that's necessarily gonna agree with you that that was a better film in the trilogy because I think everyone I think there is there is a lot I mean it's it's a it's a hotly debated issue. It's it's a more fun Batman film. I believe the Supreme Court is weighing in on that right now. Well, they just got done with with uh gay marriage.

Like, I didn't particularly care for the Lego movie just because I I think I watched it with my wife and she tends to take a lot of the fun out of those movies that are skewed more toward kids cuz she's like, \"This is too much for me. It's just crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy.\" Um, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't it wasn't one of my I was I wasn't caught up in it like everyone else. However, 21 Jump Street is my jam. I watched that like two weeks ago and I'm like, why is this movie so funny? Like, it has no right to be this funny. It really doesn't. Um, but it's just a f, you know, it's just a welltold story. And even 22 Jump Street made me laugh. Um, I can't wait for The Men in Black Crossing. It'll be interesting to see",

It doesn't sound right. I mean, I'm in. Like, here's the thing. It's about him when he's younger and stuff. It's like it doesn't need to be so much like comedy focused. Yeah. But just more the the style like 21 and 22 Jump Street have a style about them that I think lends itself very nicely to Han Solo.

I have no doubt that I'll go and watch it and enjoy it, but we've talked about this multiple times in that when you talk about Han Solo and you talk about specifically Boba Fett, is there a magic in the fact that you don't know where these characters came from? That they are just these badass characters that have no real origin stories? Like we don't know much about them?

Do we need these origin stories set in stone? Cuz to me, it's way cooler just imagining what Boba Fett, like all the crap's done. Taking Boba Fett out of it and just focusing on Han Solo. Because I agree with what you're saying about Boba, but with Han, it's like what I don't want is a origin story where he's a little kid and we see all of the things that lead up. Like that's a little too much information, but just random adventures he had and stuff.

Um and the reason that this is a significant problem is because he's going to be in the movie that comes out the year before this. So everyone is going to see two just totally two different Han Solos now. You know, I don't care if it's just a movie. It's like this is the same character. And I don't really think that Harrison Ford's story needs to be told because we already know how he got to that point. It's not a ma and it's it's not a matter like there's minutiae there where we have to kind of figure that out, but we know he got the falcon from a a bad a bad um bet with Lando.

The thing about Han Solo is that like Boba Fett and I would say I would really I almost say Han Solo might be by himself. Like Han Solo is kind of a sacred character. I think he's actually more sacred than Luke. I think he's more sacred than Darth Vader. I think he's more sacred than a lot of characters because he's the only normal one and that's like what people like and I don't mean that in any other way than like he doesn't have for the Batman of the of the Star Wars universe.

And a lot of mystique comes from the fact that he is just a normal guy that somehow survived to the point where he met Obi-Wan and Luke at that at that, you know, most Eisley in A New Hope. So, I I think I think there's going to be casting issues. And this isn't I'm excited. I'm always interested to see what they're going to do, but I I would rather them do something that explained away things that the prequels [\u00a0__\u00a0] up.

So, like you don't he need to That's what I'm saying is they were smart enough not to have him in the in the prequels. Yeah.

Two decades before that. You know what I mean? The thing with the casting that you're bringing up is like it's very true that Harrison Ford is Han Solo. So that's hard to kind of like get out of your mind but Patrick Stewart is Professor X but then we get the the prequels and I don't think anybody had an issue with that. You know what I mean? Well with that no disrespect though. Professor X is not Han Solo or anywhere, but I mean with that though, we did get the the tiein.

Whereas in order to do that, they'd have to go back and forth in time uh, in the Star Wars to kind of put them both in the same space. Not days of future past. Uh, the the first one first class.

When you saw Patrick Stewart in the future being a badass bald, you know, um, Professor X and then James Makavoy in the past in the 70s. I thought it was really cool. But also to Colin's point, it's true like Professor X is is a great iconic character to people who love comics and not people who love comic book movies, but like Han Solo is is an icon. And so you have to treat that with a lot more respect. I mean, who like Chris Pratt could play him. I think he might be one of the only people that could, unless you go find someone who's an upandcomer and unknown. Um, which might be the way be hilarious. That'd be awesome. Um, but I don't know.

Like I I think I think cuz Luke's in his 20s and they're supposed to be like peers, you know?

I was just talking about them with the other day with someone is that all signs should have pointed to them being extinct by now, yet they figured out a way to revolutionize uh the way we watch films again. and and they're much in a way they're kind and I don't want to compare them to Apple necessarily because they're definitely not nearly Apple, but they're it's Apple like in the sense that they revolutionized a way to watch movies 15",
