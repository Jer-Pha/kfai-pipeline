So, you go over to kind of funny.com/forums, go to the gamecast forum, leave some threads, leave some like uh posts and stuff, leave questions and comments and concerns about the kind of funny games. We'll get to all of them at some point. Dallas Rico. That's a great name. I'd love to hear what you all think about this fall's lineup across the three platforms. Do you think PS4 sales will suffer? This is what we keep we were going back to after E3, right? The fact that Xbox actually has exclusives for the fall where Sony does not. Maybe No Man's Sky. Probably not. But so, no. You know what I mean? So, what does that mean? I don't I I think Xbox narrows the gap but doesn't surpass PlayStation here. And I don't think PlayStation's too worried about it because they're still going to sell PS4s. You still have Fallout. Batman will still carry over.",

Batman will still carry over. Metal Gear will still carry over. And then on the other side, yeah, I mean there Xbox has Halo, you know what I mean? Which is the big one. But like Halo does only speak to a certain audience. And do those people already have Xboxes? Were they waiting for this? There's more Destiny content out now that's keeping those people happy and grabbing those people to come play. like we are in this interesting spot where it seems like and I say seems with a shrug, right, that it's flip-flopped a bit here to where PlayStation is in front and PlayStation is where your friends are playing. So when the new multiplayer game, if Destiny is still popular, comes out, you play it there. And so as we saw with PS3, right, like all the exclusives in the world didn't make them catch up and surpass 360. Eventually",

Eventually it did years and years and years later, but in terms of right now, this holiday season, I don't think Sony's sweating it. And I don't think Microsoft has delusions of grandeur that this they're going to run away with this holiday. They're definitely laying the groundwork to pull ahead, get past, you know, next year cuz next like that's what we're talking we kept talking about with E3 and then Gamescom. The fact that Microsoft has so many exclusives. They're able to come out at E3 or before E3 and be like, \"Hey, you're not going to hear about Quantum Break. You're not going to hear about these other two games. We're going to talk about them at Gamescom. This E3 is going to be totally focused on what's coming out this fall and into the future.\" So that you know, 2016 looks awesome. Even though you",

We have Tomb Raider, we have Halo. Exactly. I don't think PS4 sales are going to suffer because the people that are going to buy it are going to buy it anyways. And I don't think that any of the the exclusives would be the system sellers that people would like think that they are. You know, like even Uncharted 4, if it came out this holiday, I don't think that the that's going to sell a bazillion systems. You know what I mean? Especially because there's a bazillion already out there. Yeah. What I actually do think is I think Xbox sales are going to be be pretty good because of all the people that decided to buy a PS4 that are that were Xbox guys. Yeah. To begin with that are now going to be like, well, you know what? Now it's time to buy an Xbox.",

Now it's time to buy an Xbox. There's no longer connect. The price is lower. Here's Halo. Like, okay, you f because how when you talk to somebody who doesn't have an Xbox One, what they say is, \"Oh, I need a game on it that I care about.\" You know what I mean? And this is which is a weird thing to say, but when you think about the fact that if you're just buying thirdparty games, then PlayStation 4 can give you Batman, Witcher, whatever, you're fine. But when you get over there, you're building the same case now, right? And the fact of you have uh Sunset Overdrive, you have Halo, you have Tomb Raider, you have Massive Chalice, you have and the list goes on of games that are already games that are exclusive that you've heard enough good things about where you're like, \"All right, time's now.

And then of course there's Nintendo, which between Mario Maker, Yoshi's Willy World, and Star Fox, I'm excited. It's going to be a great time for me. Is this going to sell systems? Absolutely not. But it's going to have a good lineup of games for sure. I'm looking forward to Mario Maker. I just worry about how much I'm actually going to play it. You know what I mean? It feels like it I worry about it being one of my usual I'm super excited for this Nintendo game and I get it and I play it for a weekend and I'm done.

I Mario Platformers will forever be my favorite game, right? Ever. So, the fact that I'm now just getting that Oh man, I'm going to be all about that. But see, like that's my thing is like it sounds good on paper. You know what I mean? just like Little Bigplet does. But there has to be a finish to what's built in the game. And so once you have all the gold stars or whatever the hell they do in Mario, red coins, blue [\u00a0__\u00a0] gems, a purple shoe, once you have all the collectibles that are built into the hundred levels that are on the the CD, right?

Like I love Mario platformers. I specifically love Mario World. And I remember back in the day there was a huge thriving community for ROM hacking. Yeah. With the Mario games, specifically Mario World. And that this is to this day one of the reasons the PSP will be one of my favorite systems of all time is because you could do emulation. You could do all this stuff and you could play the ROM hacks. And all it was was expertly created Mario World levels. But the thing that made it special was that they were full games. like there was thought put into the progression of the levels and the difficulty curve and all this stuff.

But what I am looking forward to is the creators that do do that have download these 20 stages. They're a game. Yep. And uh it's going to be interesting to see how Nintendo kind of supports that and if they do support collections of levels being a thing package. Yeah. Yeah. You know, because jump and do a creators thing and do that would be that's going to be the thing that makes this go from, oh wow, I really love this and I love playing this to, \"Oh my god, this game is amazing.\" Yeah. Yeah. So, we'll see how that goes. Um, Andrew Jeff wants to know what our favorite gaming all-nighters from back in the day are.

So then it must have been NCAA 02 where I came home. It was building up to coming out. Uh my best friend Po I we he went like a week before and bought his PlayStation 2, which was a huge deal cuz in my community of gamers or friends, I was the gamer, right? And so Po always came over and played stuff at my house. He's the guy who I always talk about like we pass a controller for Metal Gear and like that was like we discovered that together. um finally buys this PS2, buys NCAA, and then the we both bought it that, you know, Tuesday or whatever. Then he came over and we played from like 4:00 in the afternoon until 6:00 in the morning the next day. Like I remember opening the door to say goodbye to him and the sun was coming up.

So, whoever had the big game was on the big screen TV and stuff. And we played like Yeah. some ridiculous amount of seasons that year, you know, because we played every game in our season. We were insane. Insane people. Crazy people. Sounds about right. I mean, I have so many me like this. This is a topic that I can go on forever. Topic, right? Yeah.

Blockbuster games, like I feel like that alone could be a topic of games I've rented and just played all night for three nights because the rental was that long and we had to get it done. Um, but the story that will always come to mind is Halo. So Halo 1, me and my friends beat together. This is me, Alfredo, and then my best friend Curran. Like they were way better than me, but we all really enjoyed playing Halo together. Halo 2 comes out November 9th, 2004. We get there, we play it, beat it in one sitting together, co-op. Halo 3 comes out, we do it again. And I will never forget it because this was a time we were in my living room. Each of us had our own TV.",

We played through the entire thing and we were playing online with one other person doing co-op with us, one of Alfredo's friends. And I remember we playing on I don't know if it was legendary. It probably was legendary or at least heroic. So it was difficult and I am not good. So I was definitely the like the guy that like just hide in the corner, let us get far and then when we hit a checkpoint, you can come out. And I was like, \"All right, I'm just enjoying this for the ride.\" And at the end of the game, spoilers for Halo 3, um there's a part where you get into Warhogs, the vehicles. Yeah.

So Kurt and his friend and Kurt and Alfredo's friend jump and make the jump. Alfredo is driving and I'm like shooting the gun and stuff and we're going he's about to make the jump and I accidentally hit the button to get out of the car. So I fall off and Alfredo just starts driving without me and then he realizes I wasn't in the car and then in real life everyone just kind of looks at me like what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] man. I'm just like, \"Just go without me, dude.

And it was just it was just the best end. And it was then like 7:00 in the morning. We all just look at each other like that just happened. That was great. So yeah. Yeah, those moments are just the best, man. The other one for me was I think it was the original Smackdown of PS1, but it might have been Smackdown. No, it must have been Smackdown on PS1 where uh so for some reason at like 3:00 in the morning like the parties part sleepover is winding down and my friend's like let's just do an hourong Iron Man match and we're like all right.

This was never in anything we like I since then have told that story and people are like yeah that that happened to me too but it's like such a weird thing where eventually the game and you weren't even playing smackdown you were playing some other game just decided you won the Mario Kart screw job. Yeah. Oh my god. All right. Who is this dude? Thomas Sinclair. Hi. Owner of the Sinclair gas station. Is it worth it to finally make the jump to current gen? Which system wins for the late adopters?

Like, I would say I I it's I honestly do feel like at this point, it's whatever whatever one you got, you'll be happy with. You know what I mean? I do think that PlayStation seems to have the leg up. And again, this is my personal interest in terms of what's out right now. Like, you know, let alone for Uncharted next year, you know what I mean? But what I'm excited about, like everything I listed today, right? So, Witcher, Batman, Dying Light, right? You and her story is a PC exclusive. So those three games right there you can get on Xbox One no problem. Massive chalice chalice state of decay are Xbox One exclusives. They're awesome. You know what I mean?

You know what I mean? So it's a weird question, but like if Halo and Tomb Raider do something for you right off the bat, then there you go. But Uncharted Collections this year still, you know what I mean? Uncharted's next year, which is awesome. Uh I'd love to see what the other first parties are doing, but like yeah, you really couldn't go wrong. It's like I always used to answer this question. I still should. I guess with the thing of just like where are your friends? Like wherever your friends are playing, that's where you want to be. So just worry about that more than anything.

You know, and like everyone was saying that, but at the end of the day, his friends play Xbox still. So he plays both constantly, but Xbox is where his where his shit's at. So it really honestly for me it's like they both seem great. They both have lineups where both systems have some games. I'm like, \"Fuck, I want to play that.\" Right. You know, if PlayStation had things like Ory, I'd be like, \"Yep, I don't need to play.\" And Cuphead, I'm like, \"Nope, that's coming Xbox, so this is going to happen.\" Yeah.

Where it's like I we have the PS4 out there. I was trying to get us onto one PS4 in the living room where Colin and I have the same our accounts are on one unit. So we have to keep disconnecting it. Then I I thought through the problem more and I put it on a second system instead of my primary system. So now my primary system is never hooked up. So I can never remote download anything cuz So I switched it out and then I come out there and Colin's disconnected it to put back in the other system. Like just recover your profile on this other system. Like it's so easy. But and it's also like well hold on the Xbox is turned on at all. You're only turning on this other thing to play Netflix. Like the Xbox can do that too. Why don't you just turn that on? You know what I mean? Yeah. Plus, Xbox Skype is awesome. We use that all the time",

At Nafier 6, what do you want to go back and play, but you know, you never will. Oh man, that's like half the games that have come out in existence. I mean, I would love to go back and I mean, like, this is not I'm sure how he means the question, but I'll get to more of his thing. I'd love to go I would love to only play DC Universe online. I would love to be so dedicated to that game that that's all I play.

I would not do it. Your livelihood depends on it. I would I would show them the reasons it's not going to be a huge deal. Let's not do this, please. Yeah. I would say like literally I my my thing with how how to make Morpheus successful and how to make money off Morpheus would be all right, cool. This tech is cool and it's so close, but it's not there yet. We can let Oculus and Hollow Lens and everybody else do this and what we'll do is PlayStation 5 will come bundled with Morpheus from the get-go. Like, I feel like that's their problem.

I don't know if I'd like to play forever.\" Blah blah blah. All that aside, it's going to be and I'm being generous. 10% of the PlayStation 4 owners buy very generous. Five between one and five are really going to adopt this thing. And so then immediately every [\u00a0__\u00a0] developer is going to be like, \"Oh, it's cool and it's great, but like we need to make games that are making money that can go Xbox to PS4s and PC, so that's not how we're going to do it.\" You know what I mean?

And then it'll be stuff like Bioshock Infinite and move integration. Yeah. Where it's like, all right, cool. You know, this thing has this and then there's like three levels like the next Batman or Rock Steady game will have three pre-order PSN things that you put on your Morpheus for and do things.

And this is where this will never happen. But if you want it to be a success, you need to partner with Microsoft in some way. Get it on the Xbox One as well because that's when it's an everybody wins situation where the only way that this is going to be a thing is if the developers can make games that work on both and third party games can get involved and it's not having to choose in this whole ecosystem of peripherals and [\u00a0__\u00a0] that no one cares about.

He's the He's Damn. His name's Dominic. Dominic, but he's the bomb. Dominic, how often do you check the hours you spend with a single game? I wish it was easy. Yeah, that's the thing is that every game makes it a little bit bit different and more difficult. And like Batman, I would have no idea how many hours I put in, but I upload all my stuff to the cloud just in for fear that I was going to lose all my progress. So, I put 50 hours into Batman, you",

I wish all games played by the same rules cuz like The Witcher, time moves differently. when you suspend your PlayStation 4, The Witcher, at least in at launch, kept counting. So, I remember looking at it like somebody asked me how long and I'm like, \"Oh, cool. Yeah, I'll check it.\" I was like, \"Oh, man. It says I've been playing for 3 days and I've had the game for that's impossible. This is broken.\" You know what I mean? It's like come on. Yeah. That shit's weird. I always I'm fascinated with game time. Like, I'm con and percentage, too. Yeah. Like, if a game tells you the percent, you're through it.

Yeah. And then I or I want a separate percentage for collectibles and all this. What Batman does really well is when you go to jump into Batman, it's like here's your save file game over Greggy and it's like 10% or whatever, but that's 10% of everything. And then when you go in, you can then look at your radial wheel and see you've done 40% of the story and yeah, 2% of the Riddler. You know what I mean? Like you get to see it broken down where you understand where that number is coming. That's cool. And then when you go to New Game Plus, you're getting like 112%. I'm like, yeah. Yeah. See, that's just great. But like I always remember with games like Donkey Kong Country or Crash Bandicoot where it would say you're 30% done just because you haven't got all the collectibles and all that.

No, it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm done with this D. Um but then there's games like Uncharted that I remember I check constantly every save point I would save and then or not save point every time I I decided I have a save point. Um I would save and then go back to the gameplay and then go back into the save because that's when it would update the percentage. So you want to see how it is. Yeah, we're weird. It becomes a badge of honor, right? And I mean, that's why I know my pat upon, you know, gameplay time on two. And then, well, I guess I don't even know it, but I remember bragging about it. And like now with Metal Gear, I'm always like, well, like in the let's plays, I'm like, this save says I've only played 67 hours, but you know, I played 90 and my Mario Golf 85 hours.

And like they just notify you about a bunch of random stats. So you play it's like congratulations you played for 100 hours. I'm like cool. Nice. Yeah.

It's just like I feel like if I can only chip away at something for a few hours, minutes, you know what I mean? Depending on what it is, I like to feel progress is being made. And that's why like to Colin's point earlier with The Witcher, right, is the fact that there's so much to do in The Witcher that it feels like you're not making progress. Yeah. All right, guys.
