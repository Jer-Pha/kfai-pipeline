            "text": "Greetings and salutations. Welcome back to Kind of Funny Games. It's time for another Let's Play, Tim. Yes, I'm excited about this one. Me, too. This is a game that has sign a significant legacy in Japan. It's called Sweet Home. Never heard of it. Sweet Home is a Japanese-only game from Capcom that is a survival horror game on the Famicom or on the NES. It was never ported outside or translated outside of Japan. The reason it's important is twofold. One, this was the inspiration for Resident Evil. And number two, Resident Evil was originally designed to be a remake of Sweet Home. Really? Yes. And eventually they went off and made Resident Evil or Biohazard as it's known in Japan instead. So, how far down does that go? Like when you play this game, does it is there the mansion and the the forest and there is a mansion in this and you and you'll see it. I I've never really played far into the game ever. Okay. This particular cartridge, for people that are wondering, this is running on an",

This particular cartridge, for people that are wondering, this is running on an NES cartridge on cartridge on our Retron 5. This cartridge was given to me by a fan of ours at Kind of Funny Live. Oh, this is a fully translated, though not authorized by Capcom ROM of the game that is then put in NES cartridge that can be played in your NES. Really cool. Um, so we're going to start here. I'm I'm not going to change the names. And here UCR Party is going to uh approach this mansion. Interesting. This is awesome already. I like this. But so it's an RPG. It's like a survival RPG. Yeah, it's it's quite unique for its time. H. And obviously when we get to Resident Evil or Biohazard, it doesn't quite play out that way. They basically have five characters that can be put into different amalgamations with each other, different groupings with each other, and each of them has like a",

Is one of them the master of unlocking? No, none of them are the master of unlocking, unfortunately. So, we'll see how far we can go. I don't know how far we're going to go. In fact, on the other screen here, you guys can't see it, but I have a FAQ from Gamefax up from 15 years ago that someone made. Wow. just to make sure that we can get through it because it these games are a little obtuse in the fact that in the sense that a lot of NES games are very adventure game like very Yeah. Okay. Oh dear. The exit. Is there zombies in this? There are all sorts of monsters. Here's one of them. Oh wow. This music's dope. It's so funny that Capcom made this game, too.

Yeah. Yeah. This is very hard to look at like the character designs at least. So you can put these into groupings. So like you have I like how like the the bodies are all upside down. So, what who I'm looking for here? Let's say uh a suka I'm looking for a suka's vacuum. Why is why is the bodies upside down? I don't know. I think it's just the way that that's just the way they walk. Like, in other words, they didn't do like an invert an inverse pallet. Well, that's dumb. Yeah, it is weird. So, we can use her vacuum.

It's a good call. Horror movie 101. Mhm. Of course. Wow. This place is huge. That left room. This reminds me of uh the House of the Dead movie. Don't ask why I watched that. Um, there's a scene in it where like maybe twothirds through they're in this house and they look over. There's [\u00a0__\u00a0] everywhere and they look and see a book. They pick up the book. This book looks old. It must be useful. I'm like, are you [\u00a0__\u00a0] kidding me? What? So, they're looking for a fresco? What the hell is a fresco?

No, definitely not. Oh, there's like a leveling system and everything. Okay. So, then party go. No, I think he's like a dope ass sushi sushi chef. Let's get everyone over here.

So, Emy's going to go and see what what's there. So, was this a hit? I don't know. I don't know. probably not enough for them to think look into translating. Although the g the game's a little obtuse for the NES audience, I think as well. But I mean, it's interesting that they would re want to remake it as Resident Evil, even if it totally changed. But like it's interesting they'd look back at this and be like, there's something there. And you said it originally was going to be a remake of this. Mhm.

Yeah, it's it's very interesting to see some of these ideas that I've never seen before in games, I don't think. I like how this one woman's walking around with a vacuum cleaner. It's like Luigi. This is actually also the inspiration. Yeah, you're probably right. Yeah, this this is pretty wild. Like yeah, team good work team. What is this? Written in blood. Wow. Power of the heart overcomes evil. What is this? I really wonder if that skeleton thought it was worth it to write that message to us, right? Probably not. Is that a fruit sword? item can't exchange.
