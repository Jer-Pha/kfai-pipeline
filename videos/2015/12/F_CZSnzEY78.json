Before that, I have a present for you. It's a figure that comes with the limited edition of matty, but it hasn't been released yet. I think the game is almost finished and it will be released soon. But what is the current situation like? Can you briefly explain? Well, since it's before the release, I'm feeling excited and my heart is swelling with anticipation. EX finish has been fing CROSS Weintime anders from how how guys with since little up about Well, there have been quite a few delays up until now and I think there have been negative comments, but I'd like to know how you feel about the concept and the negative comments and how you react to them.

Well, I am very confident about this game, so I can't say that there will be no dissatisfaction when you play it, but personally I am confident that it will definitely not be, and that you will enjoy it, and in terms of volume as well, I am confident that you will get more than your money's worth, so I can't wait for everyone to play it 1stSoweever",

After all, you've been making Mega Man for so many years, so there are parts that are like Mega Man that come out without you even being conscious of it, so I think that's there, but the thing I aimed for that was to be different from",

So, since it's Mega Man and it's an old game, you move slowly, but you have to move fast, including in the air dash, and it's a style where moving fast is cool, so that's the biggest difference. [Music] All LIFE can't see that people can get the ESSENCE of Mega from this game because you know what's been done, and it's cool to move fast. canSofSPEEDFromTheG sosomethingWe focusedOnand desThis time, the Mattie's Game series has n't been released yet, but it's the first game, so do you feel like there will be sequels and so on and so forth and you'll be expanding this franchise in the future?

What do you think about that, Yama-san? Well, personally I feel like they're really defending it, so I think that Japanese people still look at Japanese game creators as not being very good at it. I think that they still need to take on more and more challenges to be able to compete with the world. I mean, it's obvious that anyone can do those things, but it takes a lot of courage to take on new challenges like this. I think that what's lacking in Japanese games right now is challenges.  I think that feeling of maybe losing is something that anyone can hope for, but I think it's only when you can hope for the possibility of losing but also",

It 's a battle to take away the player's time, that is, how many hours they spend on mobile games and how many hours they spend on console games. In Japan, it seems to be the mobile side, but if we can make an interesting game, we can take it back. So, if it's a game that can take away that time, I think we can do it in places that are unrelated to consoles and mobile games, so I would like to challenge myself in both. I think that I should focus on how much time I can take away from users on mobile and how much time I can take away from them on consoles, and I try to challenge myself in both, rather than focusing on one or the other.

The company itself is, how should I put it, but it's weird, but everyone is a Mega Man fan, and it's a company that has people who want to make games like Mega Man, so it's a company where there's no need to explain the thoughts behind Mega Man, so when making a yo-yo scrolling action game like Mega Man, there's no need to explain how to make it,",

So in terms of concept, how do you plan to proceed in the future? Up until now, you've played a variety of games, but I've thought about whether to make a sequel or something new, and I want to make new things.
