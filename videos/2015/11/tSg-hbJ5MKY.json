Now, the intention behind what I was saying at the time was that he had reiterated what we were talking about with Star Wars. And then I was saying, well, that's actually a bad example for you to bring up, but I had brought it up and it made it seem like I was yelling at Tim for something he didn't do. So, I want to apologize to Tim about that. I accept it. I saved that. I saved that all day. I save that all day for him. I wanted to apologize to him earlier, but I wanted everyone to know that.
