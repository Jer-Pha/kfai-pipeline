Red Roma says, \"How do you all see traditional gaming space evolving over the next five years in terms of journalism?\" Oh, okay. Oh, okay. We we kind of touched on that earlier. Uh, and the other video you can check out, I assume that Well, no, there's there it gets put up as one big one, too. It's not totally disconnected. Rewind, get that watch time up. Yeah. Um, it's all it it's ever changing, right? I mean, we've seen how many different iterations of this industry now in the past 10 years. Remember when there were magazines? I mean, yeah, it was 10 years ago. Yeah. I don't know. What do you guys see?

I think the mid level sites that try to do what IGN and GameSpot do will fall away and then you'll have this spectrum that is giant sites and then the personalities. All right, there I went to IGN and I heard about all these cool stuff that's happening with Smash, but I know that when I think Smash, I think Tim or whatever. I want to go see I'm kind of funny what he's doing or Halo. I want to go see what Funhouse is talking about and stuff like that. I think also there's kind of a misnomer with the word journalism.

And but it's also it doesn't matter. It's games. They're video games. You don't I don't know. Like there was journalism when you had to figure out that uh you know, go back to like Nixon, you know, there was journalism that took place. There was a lot of investigated investigative journalism that like had an effect on the world.

And have you got we do this one where we we it's going to run out soon which is great because someone gave us a packet of old demodis from like uh PC gamer and all these things and we go through it and we try to play old games on a Windows 8 machine. Now it's Windows 10. 95% of them don't work. Not at all. And so we end up playing that's such a funny idea. So we end up playing porn flash games instead.

You can find that I think someone already ripped it and did a video but um yeah I I showed it at a panel in London because Jack hadn't seen it yet. So I was like I'm going to show this video during the panel just so Jack can watch it so he knows what we do. Yeah, I would watch that and you get an idea of like who we are.
