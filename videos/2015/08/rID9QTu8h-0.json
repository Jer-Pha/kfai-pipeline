No. Dunle. Thank you Kevin Duncle for all your support. Okay. Do you think that his friends call him the Dunks? Yeah. I would call We're calling him the Dunks from now on. This is his second thank you video for us ever. So much. What are you doing? I'm fine. Is that better? I didn't. What? I'm not like I'm just trying. It didn't help me at all either. No, I don't. It's the road is bright. Like there just it's just the sun is doing things. It's so hot. When you think of Sunday dinner, like Sunday night, what do you think of Sunday dinner or Sunday night? Sunday night. What do you think of Sunday night? What does that mean to you in general? It means I'm going to watch Ballers and even though my wife ordered Chinese food, I might still get T-Bell. All right. I think back like when I think of Sunday night, I think of",

I think back like when I think of Sunday night, I think of Lois and Clark, New Adventures of Superman. I remember taking a shower at night after it was I think I if memory serves, I took the shower right before Lois and Clark. Okay. You know, and then my mom would cook something usually. I'm thinking summertime grilling. Oh, nice. Like a skirt steak on the grill. Marinated dress. What about you, Tim? What do you think of Sunday reminds me of homework that I should have done? I [\u00a0__\u00a0] hated that. That was the thing about Sunday. It was always a depressing day. Still is. Yeah. You know, thinking back on it like high school and all that [\u00a0__\u00a0] Teachers are [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] up. Why would they give you homework you have to do on the weekend? That's not cool. Like what's the point of that? Yeah. If I was if I ever become a teacher, I'm not giving weekend",

Suck the souls out of those little [\u00a0__\u00a0] But here's here's my other thing. Why do we have a system where the kids have to then go home and do more work on top of that? Like what does that teach them? Uh when they go away, they they have to like, you know, implement what they learned in class. Yeah, but like why can't they just do they got an hour in? You can't teach me something in an hour. All right. So here's I mean my response would be like why why can't you guys get work done at the house but then when you go home you get more work done. No I get plenty of work done at the house. I just choose to get more work done because that work equates the money that goes into my pocket. Whereas in in high school it's like I'm never",

Whereas in in high school it's like I'm never going to use Spanish. I got to say when we're all all by ourselves we get more work done. Oh I get more Yeah. I'm more productive. That doesn't mean work done. But it's the it's the difference between like for instance when I took Spanish I would be like I really wish I could just learn Spanish in this hour. I don't want to I'm I'm useless when I go home when I was a kid. When I was a kid, all I have is distractions and I don't want to do the thing because there's no inherent value to me to in it, right? Like for instance, one day I knew I was like, I'm going to make really good friends with a guy named Kevin. He's going to speak Spanish and order all the food that I want in Spanish anytime I need him to. Sure. Including Italian food, which is really awkward for the waiters that don't speak",
