This topic is supported on Patreon by the one and only Mike Biffle and his game volume. Now, what's exciting about this, Colin? And why it's the second topic? Do you know why they get through? Why would volume be sponsoring the second topic? Of course, they went to patreon.com/kindfunname kind of. They went No, not the topic. They went to patreon.com. So, you're being literal about why kind of funny games. All right. Sponsored us for a month of shoutouts because they're awesome.

And that's what this game is. I mean, it's it's it's it's just those clever VR missions and kind of collecting things as you go and stuff like that.

Okay, but the topic is gaming omissions, the things we didn't play, but should have. Okay, now this stems from, of course, you saw me lugging around my 3DS. Yeah, I don't know why you saw me tweet that I was playing Super Mario Brothers 3. Oh, that's right. Yeah, Tim asked me about this, I believe, during the RTX panel, but it might have been Games Cast last week. And both of you flabbergasted to find out. I've never played Super Mario Brothers 3.

But I've never sat down, owned a copy of Super Mario 3, and played it. I didn't have an NES. I was a Sega kid. My first Mario game was the one on Game Boy. I can never remember. Super Mario Land. Yeah, that's the one. Uh, so I mean, I've always been behind in Mario games, but I obviously I've played Mario 1. I've played Mario 2. That was one a lot of times you played at your friend's house. That was a big one. And then three, for some reason, never got played in that that that ecosystem.

So, with the exception of or access to them, all of them. So, of any, you know, the mainstream ones, I mean, yeah. Uh, but on PC, I mean, the the my my glaring weak spot on PC is almost everything, you know. Um, but specifically, I'm thinking about like the 1980 to 1995 era or so. So, I feel like there's a lot of gaming genetic stuff, like like really important stuff on on PC that I know and I've read extensively about, but I've not played. The games that come to mind are like Ultima, uh, like all the Ultima games. um which were heavily inspired by D and D which heavily inspired Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.

As opposed to games that just passed us by, which I think are two different things. To your point about mobile gaming and stuff like that. Listen, like look, look, that's not a real gaming platform to me. And you though, no, but I want to just explain I just want to explain where I'm coming from with this that mobile gaming has been destructive to the kinds of games that we like.

There's not a fourth leg, you know? And so I'm not saying that is like if you like those games, more power to you. But like this is your opinion. Exactly. But what I'm trying to say is like I'm overwhelmed enough with the games I miss without having to think about a platform that I feel like has been largely destructive anyway and that I don't really destroy.

If they're if that's going to take down a shitty console game, then I don't want to play it to begin with if you're going to be nickel and diamond going out there. Sure. I mean the the benefit of mobile gaming I think is and granted they kind of came up together but stick with me is the fact that it opened up the door for indies you know it was the first place where it was for 99 bucks you're a game developer and go try something and go do something and get your feet wet and learn I mean look at like Mitchell Morgan look at learn code how are you going to make an app how you going to do this and then you can start wrapping your head around making a video game which I think you saw Sony and Microsoft",

Now granted, Steam was there totally the green light program. They were indie games were happening there as well, but I think part of the ground swell is mobile. I guess I I I I mean there's certainly a point to be made there. But I do think that mobile gaming is a race to the bottom. It's a a question of volume. It's a question of iteration. It's a question of copying. It's a question of like all these kinds of things. There's like no like for all of the games that are on mobile that seem like there's love put into them, there's many more that aren't. There's no there's no quality control.
