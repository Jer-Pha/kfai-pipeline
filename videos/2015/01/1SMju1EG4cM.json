It might take you a couple years. >> Why are you talking like your Hulk\nHogan impression? What am I doing [CROSSTALK] that's my Hulk\nHogan [CROSSTALK] so I'm gonna pull that out from time to time. Now, Greg, we're selecting, there's six\nMega Man games on NES. They're all awesome games. We're selecting 2 for a few reasons. 2 is the most popular. Beloved Mega Man game. >> Okay.\n>> It's the first one that started the real craze. A lot of people didn't care about Mega Man\n'til Mega Man II came out. >> Sure.\n>> And it's the easiest one. >> Oh, good.",
