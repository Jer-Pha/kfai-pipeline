We want you to keep going there and enjoying that content whatever. But we think that we can do what we do better on our own. And I think that that's that is why we made this decision. It's a bold decision. We all had totally secure jobs with great salaries and benefits. Like Nick was saying, we had, you know, high stature at IGM. We were we were, you know, pretty well known there. And we we you know, you have to take a risk every once in a while.

We talked about it 6 months ago. We're like, wouldn't remember that conversation we had like what what would it take for all of us to leave, right? Like let's let's figure out how much we're all making and like let's let's figure out our minimum numbers to walk away.

Uh Game of Gregy show is now going to be better because we're not going to be [\u00a0__\u00a0] tired all the time. We're going to have better ideas for new, you know, new shows. What were you going to say? What I was going to say is like Game of Gray Show is going to be better because now we can talk about movies and comics and TV shows whenever the hell we want that too. Like the thing is like what you guys don't know is that we've been so limited just on on this channel. Um because we couldn't talk about those things.

It's like m it's close. I don't think we should do it. So, we just don't do it. So, instead, we talk about other stuff, which is great, but it's like now we get to talk about what we want to talk about at that moment. Not that we still don't want to talk about Disney princesses. You want to have sex. No, we're always going to do that. But that's the thing is though, we couldn't really talk about the new Disney movies.

And I I think what's most exciting about it is, you know, IGN has this huge reach and we've always been honored and and thankful for that. But we don't need that kind of reach to to do what's satisfying for us and to satisfy the smaller group of people that want to kind of ride or die with us, which is yeah, they care about what we say, which is which is I think what's so exciting. Like that's what's really in invigorating to me is like I actually want to talk to a smaller group of people that like really that really care and really like that aren't there just because just because of a snazzy headline or just there because it's the news of the day, but because they want to know what we think about X, Y, and Z.

Well, IGN was a great place to spend my 20s and now and that's I was there my entire 20s and that's awesome. Um, and now we're going to do something else.

And I don't I don't know if they do it in thinking kind of funny, but they thinking that I'm getting to a point where the next thing's coming for me. And that's what it is for me, right? Is and I've talked about it a lot in the same way everybody else talk about. I was at IGN for eight years. They gave me the world. They let me step up, be the face of the site for the longest time and I'll never be able to repay them for that. Um, but it was I felt we how long can you sit there and do that?

And then in that time how many editors have Colin and I see come and go that just do it forever and burn out on reviews. And I always say that like if I was still the PlayStation editor, if I was still an editor on the PlayStation team, I would have burned out a long time ago, too.

You know what I mean? there was no promotion to be a higher host at IGN or something like that, right? I was already the host. No offense to anybody there of IGN. So then it just became of like, well now I want to go try to be a host somewhere else. I want to take these independent opportunities. I want to go try to be out in the world and do that while doing my own stuff.
