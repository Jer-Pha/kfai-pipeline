Welcome to A Conversation with Collin. I'm Greg and this is my roommate, Collin. Sometimes Collin says crazy stuff, so thanks for your support on Patreon. We're back for one final season where I'll reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at him, and we'll talk it out for your amusement. If you like that, like this video, subscribe to our channel, support us on Patreon so you make more crazy videos like this, and share this with your friends. Collin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic is Review Embargoes, A Moral or Not Unfair to the Consumer? This was submitted by at Tundi underscore HTK. Collin. Yeah. We worked at IGN for about eight years. Yes. We had a slew of review embargoes while we were here. Many a review embargo. It's one of those things where for us, the word embargo makes so much sense. For the viewer at home, if you",

For the viewer at home, if you don't know, embargoes are basically like you can't write or talk about this until this date this time. Right, right. No, I think that's fine. It makes sense that a company would give you early access to something, and in return, they ask that you simply don't talk about it until X date. There are two exceptions, of course. One is if the embargo falls at a time or date after the product is readily available, at IGN we didn't even follow those embargoes, and those embargoes are stupid and they rarely ever existed. And B, the embargo would never be contingent on a certain kind of coverage. That was the only thing that mattered, and I can speak from our experience at IGN that that never happened. No one ever was like, the embargo is the day of release and you better not say anything bad about",

No one ever was like, the embargo is the day of release and you better not say anything bad about it. Right, right, right. That didn't happen. I understand what Tunde is saying about the unfair to the consumer, but we talk about this all the time on Podcast Beyond, that there is a way to see through this. If a game is coming out, it's the day before release and there's no reviews, and everyone is saying, oh, we can't talk until midnight. Not necessarily, but oftentimes that's a bad sign. You know what I mean? That is that they're trying to hide something. Now, granted, with Twitter and trending you need to be, everyone is talking about the conversation at one point, but it's really awkward when there is a midnight release on the East Coast, which is going to be 9 o'clock Pacific, so people are going to be playing it on Twitch, on everything, but we can't talk about it until the next",

That's bad. Yeah, well, I agree. That's what I said. That's an irrelevant embargo to me. At that point, that's not an embargo anymore. The game is available, it's out, you can do what you want with it. Yeah, you can stream it, but see, this was always my thing in terms of, okay, you're giving us a bullshit embargo. That sucks. But the problem, of course, is, and why embargoes are part of the industry, is that, yeah, you're giving the product early. So the thought process for me always was if the game is available at 9 o'clock on the East Coast, I think it should be totally fine to stream it, talk about what you're seeing and what you're doing, but reviewing it is a different story. Because if they weren't giving us the game early, we'd be buying it at midnight or whenever",

Because if they weren't giving us the game early, we'd be buying it at midnight or whenever we're playing. True, and then we wouldn't have gotten that far. There's no way to have impressions, have a written review, have a story. No, that's fair. That's true. And then you also have to look at embargoes another way, too, which is kind of to give the authors, the critics, a way to prepare what they need to say for a certain time. So if they get a game seven days early, they know everyone else is tied to this embargo. They don't have to rush, they're not trying to get their thing out the door early, it's not hastily done, it's not incomplete. And then I think that actually better serves the consumer. I understand why it's frustrating from the outside. Certainly, I used to be frustrated by that, too. But it makes sense. I mean, we're getting a product that the companies in no way,",

I mean, we're getting a product that the companies in no way, shape, or form have to provide us and they could just say go out and buy it and then wait. But that hurts them, too, which is why the embargo, you know, because most games are sold in the first few weeks. So the vast majority of a new game's copies are sold within a week or two or a month at the most. So this benefits, I think, the consumer in the sense that they have a complete look at the product. And we've missed embargoes at IGM many times. Sure. Game comes late. Right. I never, you know, I would always do my best to hit an embargo. I think I always would hit my embargoes. But there have been times where I'm like, what was a good example? NHL a couple of years ago, that came out and we couldn't play it online in a satisfactory way.

The embargo is like that hard and fast thing where we have to hit it and we must, you know, it's there to say you can hit it as of this point. Yeah. I mean, my favorite part about what you just said, right, is of course the unspoken nuclear arms agreement of like everyone has this embargo but everyone's finger's on the button. So if Kotaku breaks it or if games, you know, then you're ready to launch yours as well or have a frantic conversation with PR of like, hey, this is happening. It's out there now. What do we do? Right. That's always the one downside to an embargo, especially when you're talking about international things. I think, yeah, that's true.

And we've, and embargoes have moved many times for big games because people have broken the embargo. I'm glad that we're talking only about review embargoes though, because I do think that preview embargoes and announcement embargoes make plenty of sense and I don't think really need to be justified at all. I think it's just a matter of like, we know a lot of things and have seen a lot of things very early and have been told not to say anything and that's, you know, that's an exchange for that kind of early access to prepare what we need to say so that we can inform the readers all the way to the other. I mean, that's the big thing. Everything you're hitting on is just being able to be prepared to give a comprehensive look. Exactly. And I think that's the one thing with embargoes that people miss is that it's a level playing field for all outlets and all critics.",

There's no rush jobs and then everyone goes at the same time and then you see where everything falls. I think for me, we've given reviews that, you know, both of us have given, I think a single 10 to a game. We both gave one 10, right? You never gave more than that. Me too. And then we've given scores as low as I gave a two to something. So, and all those had embargoes. Sure. You know, so it's just a matter of preparing. Unfair to the consumer, no. I think frustrating the consumer. Yeah, I understand that. It sucks to know that all these people you are friends with, obviously we talk about being best friends, are out there playing this game, but they can't tell you and they can get questions about it.
