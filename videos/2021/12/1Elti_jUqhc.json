    "description": "Epic Creator Code: KindaFunny\n\nWe partnered with NVIDIA GeFoce to help you push your gaming performance, resolution, and graphics quality as high as it\u2019ll go. Andy Cortez is here to show you how NVIDIA DLSS is not just some obscure gaming acronym \u2013 it\u2019s a useful PC gaming technology that NVIDIA GeForce RTX gamers can take advantage of in over 140 games!\n\n \nThis video is sponsored by NVIDIA GeForce. Learn more about NVIDIA DLSS here: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/\n\n \n\nFor years, PC gamers had to find a compromise between their frames per second, their image resolution, and the quality of their gaming graphics. With the AI-powered technology of NVIDIA DLSS, enabled by NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs, a growing list of games is allowing you to enjoy the ultimate gaming experience.\n\n\nSubscribe And Ring The Notification Bell: \nKinda Funny: http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub_confirmation=1\nKinda Funny Games: http://www.youtube.com/kindafunnygames?sub_confirmation=1\nKinda Funny Plays: http://www.youtube.com/kindafunnyplays?sub_confirmation=1\n\nGet The Shows Ad-Free On Patreon: \nKinda Funny http://www.patreon.com/KindaFunny \nKinda Funny Games http://www.patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames\n\nBuy Some Merch: http://www.kindafunny.com/store \n\nFollow Us On Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids \n\nFollow Us On Instagram: http://instagram.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nWatch Us Live On Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames\n\nListen To Our Podcasts On Your Favorite Podcast Service:\nThe Kinda Funny Podcast: https://bit.ly/3wA9GVo\nIn Review \u2013 Movies Ranked, Reviewed, & Recapped: https://bit.ly/2VAgdT7\nKinda Funny Screencast \u2013 TV & Movie Reviews Podcast: https://bit.ly/3e7yQ75\nKinda Funny Gamescast: https://bit.ly/3wBgRwg\nKinda Funny Games Daily: https://bit.ly/2T3Y3rS\nPS I Love You XOXO \u2013 A PlayStation Podcast: https://bit.ly/3r3rjvB\nKinda Funny Xcast \u2013 An Xbox Podcast: https://bit.ly/36twqvD\n\nFollow The Kinda Funny Team On Twitter:\nGreg Miller: https://twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nTim Gettys: https://twitter.com/TimGettys\nNick Scarpino: https://twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nAndy Cortez: https://twitter.com/TheAndyCortez\nBlessing Adeoye: https://twitter.com/BlessingJr\nMike Howard: https://twitter.com/SnowBikeMike\nKevin Coello: https://twitter.com/KindaFunnyKevin\nJoey Noelle: https://twitter.com/joeynoelle\nBarrett Courtney: https://twitter.com/SadBoyBarrett\nRoger Pokorny: https://twitter.com/rogformer\nGreg Gettys: https://twitter.com/KindaCoolGreg\nGary Whitta: https://twitter.com/garywhitta\nParris Lilly: https://twitter.com/vicious696\nJanet Garcia: https://twitter.com/Gameonysus\nTamoor Hussain: https://twitter.com/TamoorH\n\nIn Review Intro Videos by: https://twitter.com/CameronKen\nIn Review Intro Music by: https://twitter.com/CarterHarrell",
