            "text": "what is the best way to end a Trilogy Of course there are plenty of obvious answers when it comes to ending any Story Trilogy or not the core of those answers are always the same thing it needs to be satisfying enough to make the journey feel worthwhile when it comes to specifically a Trilogy however I do think there is an added layer that needs to be considered and that is to find the best way to mix the tone and sensations of the first two installments in the story it helps the entire trilogy come together and feel whole for example while Return of the Jedi gets teased for just how silly it can get I do think there is a good balance between the campiness from A New Hope and the more serious philosophical tone from Empire Strikes Back to really make the original Star Wars Trilogy feel like one cookies of story and not just three separate movies and to me Batman Arkham Knight does that as well while it gets harped on for not necessarily adding anything new besides the Batmobile which",
