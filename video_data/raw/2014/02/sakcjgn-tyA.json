I'm Greg and while you are out living your life, buying blinds for that condo you're never actually going to get around to getting, uh, the fine people at Oreo were making endless variations of Milk's favorite cookie. So, every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like this video, then subscribe to my channel. Today we are reviewing it's a mouthful. Double chocolate fudge Oreo fudge creams. Like I said, a mouthful. Now here, this is we're all over the place, ladies and gentlemen. For a long time, the fudge creams were the cookies to beat. We had the peanut butter. We had the mint. These were good. They really good. 8.5, 9.0. A whole bunch of scores. Then we did the golden fudge cream. Last time around, not as well. 6.0, I believe. Let me check the stats over here. Yeah, 6.0. Now we're to double fudge creams. I don't know how it's going",

I don't know how it's going to go. Let's see. Tear it open. First the first look. The first part of every Oh, what the hell is this first look? Oh my gosh. It's like it's just like a train overturned and everybody got tossed around. They're in the dining car. Their food's all over them. Spaghetti on the wall. Uh cookies everywhere. That's not a good way to start. You want you want to open up. You want it to be pristine. Let's move on to part two. Taste test. No. Okay. I like it so far. We know that I'm not Well, my big thing on Oreo Oration is I'm not a fan of different chocolates mixing together. That's a problem, right? We talk about the chocolate of the cookie, the chocolate cream together. Sometimes it gets this weird texture doesn't taste right. It gets too sweet. It gets too weird. It gets too overpowering.",

It gets too overpowering. Here, we're not having that problem. with the double fudge Oreo fudge creams. The cookie itself is so thin, it's just giving that crisp uh crisp bite to it. You know what I mean? And then the cream itself and the cream around it seem to match. So, it's actually a chocolatey treat. I I know a lot of chocolate lovers out there have been watching the show looking for the Oreo to fix that choahholic need. This could be it. I like I like what we're doing so far. Next, we do the milk pairing. Guess what? It's not going to be dunkable. We already knew that. One, two, three. No change. Still a chocolatey cookie. Now it's just a wet chocolate cookie on the outside. But it doesn't matter cuz the milk's refreshing to, you know, drink afterwards. Remember, of course, be aware of fudge teeth. This is the",

Remember, of course, be aware of fudge teeth. This is the big problem we've had on this show with the fudge creams. They screw up your teeth. They screw your teeth bad. Not forever, just while you're having a conversation. Don't if if you're about to give a speech to the Pope, don't eat a bunch of these and then get up and be like, \"Your holiness.\" He'll be like, \"Bro, fudge teeth oration. Why aren't you watching it?\" Let's talk about twisting. You can't twist them. We already knew this. Two outlets. They don't make They don't make a hole. Can't do that. So, now we're already lightning paste to the review part. I like these. I'm saying these are the first chocolatey chocolate cookie I can endorse for you guys. Can't dunk them. I'm going to go flat eight. A flat eight on them. Um the crisp is there for the cookie. Then it's all this chocolate. The",

It's the Oreo chocolate, the double chocolate fudge, whatever the hell that is. Niscoco's trying though. If you're a chocolate lover, 8.0. This is probably the way to go. Now, that's the way the cookie crumbles for double chocolate fudge Oreo fudge creams. A mouthful. Uh but what do you think? Have you tried these at home? If so, leave your review as a video response below. Then like the video and then subscribe to my channel. Big thing. Am I missing any Oreos? I'm trying to get, you know, pretty much the Pokedex of Oreo reviews up on YouTube. I need you to tell me what Oreos I'm missing in the comments below where I can get them. I will go get them. Then you share the video with your friends.",
