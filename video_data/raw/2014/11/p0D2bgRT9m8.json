You might be saying, Greg, I have sent you Oreos from Korea. I have sent you Oreos from China. I have sent you Oreos from Japan and you didn't review them. These are all true things that happened.

You think mocha latte, but they say macala latte, and who am I to judge how the Japanese want to package their Oreos and say stuff? So that's what we can read. We look at it. You look at the back, it's all it's it's in it's like it's in another language. It's all Greek to me, as they say. All Japanese to me. All right. It came in the funny box. It's got the things. You I when I was over there a few years ago, I saw KitKats. They had the green tea. KitKat. That was a big thing.

Let's look at these guys here. This is the first look. It's Whoa. Whoa. Hold on, everybody. They smell different. They don't smell domestic, that's for sure. But if you look at them, there's a lot of different things happening on them. Don't laugh, Mick. I can't get through it if you're laughing. What does that mean? It doesn't smell domestic. It doesn't smell like an Oreo I've ever smelled before is what it means. You look at them. There's less there's less space on these guys, obviously.

If you look there, you see the caramel apple one has the logo there with the Nabiscoco. Uh, I don't know. I always thought of the antenna, if you will, but it says Oreo in the middle. This guy over here doesn't have the shelf space. It looks like to do that. Also, on the flip side of this one, still just that same logo here. It says Oreo. Nope, that's the exact same. I've already forgotten what a regular Oreo looks like, so that isn't an important part of the test. We will stop talking about that. But first look, they're weird. I mean I mean there's Oreo bits here in the United States. Of course, like you get back on the plate. It's not like that's weird, but there's something going on in the smell factory here.

It's not unpleasant. But it's not normal. It's not domestic. As I said before, it's it it almost has hints of you. You of course had a rabbit growing up, right? Person watching this video. I did. And their food, the little pellets kind of had that smell to it. That's kind of what these guys have. Let them back out there. Come on. Get out of here. There we go. All right. So, these guys are This is what happens in Japan. This is the traditional Japanese dinner from what I understand. Um, first look, they're all intact first off, which is impressive.

If you're worried right now, a lot of people have bugout bags, right, for like when the earthquakes hit or whatever, just put Oreos in there. You'll be fine. That's all you need. Uh, first look, they look all right. Dark green, hulkish. Now, we're going to get into taste. [Music] H. So, what I'm going to tell you is I like them. Now here the problem is the maca latte part I'm not getting a lot of. I feel like the chocolate cookie part is what it's all about here. It's soft. It's pillowy. It's it's it dissolves in your mouth.

These American brash cookies, these watermelon cookies don't they don't do with the creams? I enjoy this, but to what degree? Let's find out how they pair with milk. I got a lot of cookie in my mouth here. Okay, I'm gonna I'll do them one by one. First ever international Mclroy moment. One, two, three. I wish I knew how to count in Japanese. That would have been cool. I should have done some research. I don't like it. They're clumping together the chocolate. The thing I think these guys got going for them is that the chocolate cookie is lighter than its American counterpoint. Uh, it's fluffier. It's It feels more like a delicacy.

Japan knows what's up. Let's go for the double stuffed maca latte. There you go. Okay, let's see what they're doing here. Here's where it all comes. It's a house of cards. The orioration scale. 20 points, of course. I'm going to give these guys an 8.5. A great cookie. A solid cookie. Now, here's what's impressive about the Bits sandwiches. Oreo Bits sandwiches. First off, it's a bad title. We can't fault them for that. Or Oreo bits would be that they're broken up and then put back into sandwich form. Oreo bits sandwiches make sense.

I could continue to do that the rest of the night here without a problem. You go back to the caramel apples if you would. The problem is that you can't eat those like that. You can only have a few of those. It's the birthday cake syndrome we've talked so much about, right? Where you have this cookie that's so so sweet, so delicious. You can only have a few to go, \"Oh, no, thank you.\" This one's muted. It's a treat to enjoy.

Did you ever think about that? Why didn't you date him? He could have been something big on the internet, but nobody thought about that at the time. They just said, \"Oh, we don't want to hang out with him. He's a little overweight.\" But who's laughing now? The Oreo bit sandwiches are. That's the way the cookie crumbles for maca latte Oreo bits sandwiches. But what do you think, ladies and gentlemen? Have you been to Japan?
