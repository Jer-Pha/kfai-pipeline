It's good to see you. It's good to see you, you look good today. Thank you. The beard, we're getting on that borderline where it's gotta go. I gotta shave. Are you becoming part of the club? Are you joining the club? It's a good club? Join it. No, this is the club, this is the ladies club. It's weird that when I think beard, I'm like, Nick has a beard, never do I think Tim has a beard. There you go. Tim's not committed to the beard. This is gonna be gone soon. It reaches a point, I don't know how to maintain things because I'm not good at a lot of stuff. So this is just gonna be gone. We'll start over. You're literally great at everything. You are so active. I'm very mediocre at everything. I excel at nothing. The producer, Nick Scarvino. Hey everyone. Hey, how you doing? Thanks for joining us. Good looking beard",
