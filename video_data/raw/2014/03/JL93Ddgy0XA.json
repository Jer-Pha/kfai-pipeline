The Pure One, Tim Geddes. What's up host? And the producer slash seducer, Nick Scarpino. Welcome to the show everyone, thanks for watching. You put on your deep radio voice for that. I like to go into it. I like to start there and then by the end of the two hours of madness, I go into the fast talking high pitched Scarpino voice. He starts with the seduce and ends in the produce. I've never heard a high pitched Scarpino voice. Why did you attack your Starbucks cup? No, I was like boom to Tim, but then I got the straw going on the way and I was like, ooh, water. It's tasty. I've still never heard your high talking Scarpino. I just start talking faster as the day goes by and people can't understand what I'm saying. So I'll start to mutter, I'll start to mumble a little bit, go, go, go, go, go, go. And then everyone's like, I just",

Ladies and gentlemen, the idea of the Game Over Gregi show is simple. Every week four of our best friends gather around a table, each bringing a random topic of conversation to it. We talk it out for your amusement. If you like that, like the video and buy the MP3. Tim, explain it. Man, that's crazy. Well, Fridays, Fridays are Game Over Gregi Day. No matter where you are, you can get some new stuff on Friday. A full episode of something on Friday. You can get the early episode on GameOverGregi.bandcamp.com for 99 cents. That's an MP3, a high quality MP3 for a dollar. Well, 99 cents is a dollar, right? If somebody says 99 cents, you're assuming you're",

The full show, the entire show will go up live on Friday. But before that, the rest of the week you're getting the clip outs. Yeah, we give you every topic broken out over four days. It's the best of both worlds, as they say. It's the best of both worlds, something, something and then you rock out the show. Remember that? That was Hannah Montana. Best of Both Worlds is an awesome Jay-Z R. Kelly album. But you also remember it from Hannah Montana. I don't know if I'd say awesome. I'd vote for that one. That's a great album.

Now, you kind of mentioned this in passing to me. What does this mean? Pilot suicide. Well, you know this Malaysia airliner that went missing. The one, the lost airline. Well, remember we're putting this show up a week later. Maybe it's been found. We don't know. But Colin and I are referring to it as Oceanic 815. That's what you're referring to? Yeah. You know there are real lives on this plane, right? Yeah, but it's like lost. It just kind of went completely crazy. Hey, can you straighten that painting? Actually, it's an Indian Ocean problem.

One of the theories is, at this point in time, is that there was a pilot. The pilot decided to kill himself and took the plane down. And you say that and that sounds ridiculous to me. I'd never heard of a pilot suicide before. It's happened before. A lot. It happens a lot, it turns out. Here's the Washington Post article I was reading this morning. According to the Federal Aviation Administration data, 24 American pilots have killed themselves while flying their planes in the last two decades. Did they kill themselves with people? Some of them. 23 of those pilots intentionally crashed their aircraft. One student jumped out of his plane mid-flight. All the pilots killed themselves were male and middle-aged. None of the American pilots who killed themselves were flying a big commercial aircraft, but it has happened elsewhere.",

This is what the Washington Post records. You would be the only person at the table that would know that. According to the cockpit, the post recordings there, the copilot left to use the bathroom. When he returned, the door was locked. The flight recorder has him banging on the door trying to get in, and then just taking the plane down with all 33 on board. That was just a mistake? No, that was real. That guy was like, I'm going to kill myself. He was waiting for the copilot to leave, and then he's like, I'm going to kill myself and",

I don't like the one B. A couple of them happened. Two years later, a Cairo-bound aircraft plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean off Nautucket in 1999. All 217 passengers and crew were killed. During the plane's tailspin, its pilot whispered in the Arabic phrase, I rely on God, traditionally muttered moments before death. What the fuck is wrong with these people? My God. I think we've all agreed. We'll all agree. We're pro-suicide. You want to kill yourself, go about it, whatever. That's the right way to put it. I know, and it's not. I'm simplifying it quite a bit.

I don't like when people are inconsiderate in their normal daily lives. To take that the farthest step possible forward and go, I'm going to go ahead and kill people with me because that's who I am.

That's a nice legacy you're leaving for yourself there. I don't even know where to start with that.

Probably not during Korea because they'd be 85 years old. Yeah, that's a good point. But Vietnam potentially. Or even the Iraq war. You have a lot of these guys that are military pilots that go into the private sector and they get paid a lot, but you still have issues. I don't know. That's crazy. I have to imagine they do a lot of psyche vows to be a commercial pilot. Well, you'd like to imagine. You'd like to imagine that. But I'd also like to imagine they train the flight attendants.

It's months of training and you have to log hours and get it checked off and then you can finally fly on your own or whatever. But for a pilot to do that... Pilots, from what I understand, and I have a very base knowledge of it, is that it's a long trek to become a pilot. Because once you... You make like no money when you're a copilot, but then once you get pilot, that's when you start making money, but you're much older at that point. Because you put in so many hours as a copilot.

No, we don't leave the house for anything that's crap. You didn't even bother. Being a commercial airline pilot is a huge sacrifice. Yeah. That's why they have things called flop or crash houses because copilots and flight attendants will live together and eight people, ten people in a house because they don't have any money.

First of all, like this has happened before so maybe I just read the news a lot and I know. But, you know, when I think about something like 9-11, which was Muslim extremist hijacking a plane, going to school in Florida to learn how to fly a plane, then hijacking a plane and ramming them in the buildings to kill themselves and everyone on them and everyone in the building. It's like a much easier leap to say that the pilot would just do that directly. You know what I mean? Like just crash the fucking plane. It's crazy.

Whereas someone who's just depressed and wants to end their life takes out all these other people. That's when it gets weird. Yeah, but I'm just saying it's not surprising. That's so much easier to do so you would think that it would happen even more often. Yeah. Like I guess is what I'm saying. 9-11 required all of these heinous years-long planning to do and they executed it and three of the four planes were good to go. This happens once every few years.

No. I've had enough. I'm taking this thing down. You have to just think about it mathematically. I always think about this because we travel all the time.

But like this you know planes as pilots and people in the airline industry say planes want to stay in the air. Like you actually have to like try to get the plane to go down usually you know because you know like once the plane you know take off and landing are the most dangerous parts of flying.

So there's just mathematically like it's so improbable that anything's going to happen that like if it does happen to you on the one of these planes you have to kind of be like this is like this is fucking insane.

Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean. It's not really roller coasters. This is before Pirates of the Caribbean. Well no they had they had to put a pin in that one. I'll tell you the Pirates of the Caribbean story in a little bit. OK we're going to put a pin in that one. What's the what's the Whiskey Mountain. Whiskey Mountain",

So those are my experiences with roller coasters. This is this is pre California adventure when they actually had that badass roller coaster they have now. So I go to Magic Mountain. It's really California. And the first ride we go on is this whatever the I don't know what the wooden roller coaster they used to have. I think they still have it at Magic Mountain. It is horrifying. It sounds like it's going to pull apart every time anything happens. So we did that and then man the wind did the Superman ride and I was like no I'm hooked. Superman.

Yeah that would be like a more unfair though like your mom or video games. So you are throwing people in there. No no no I'm just saying that's why it gets unfair. OK OK OK. Because then you have to get really great. No people. No no no people obviously like my family. Yeah you have to choose your family. What do you think Greg would choose over video games that he's not thinking of. I think Greg I think there's a legitimate chance Greg would you know choose sports over video games if Greg can never watch a Mizzou game again or talk about Mizzou in a way that he can really associate with them like he did when he was there. That would probably probably be very painful thing for Greg. You",

There are very few people on the planet that played more video games than I have you know but it's not been like this dominant overbearing force in my life. Yeah you're telling me I think for sure I would still. Everything you just did video games. Yeah it would hurt. I mean giving up any of these things would suck right. That's the big thing.

It's just impossible to imagine because it really is literally impossible for me to imagine my life if you just remove politics from my life. I won't even be myself anymore. Yeah. So I think this is where this is where I kind of get a little disappointed with myself is that I don't have I don't think I could list five things that I care about 10 out of 10 movies done when you want you talk about movies on the level we talk about video games.
