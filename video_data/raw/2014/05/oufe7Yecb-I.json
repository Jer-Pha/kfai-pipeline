Uh, I'm on vacation all week and I'm and the theme of the vacation is retirement. So, I'm pretending like I'm actually retired. So, I've been getting up I've been getting up every morning going to the diner down in the inner sunset that I really like and I'll I'll read the news with the old people sitting at the counter which is a lot of fun. Do they know you by name yet? Do you hang your hat when you come in? No. No. I'm just like, \"Hello, how are you?\" Do you do it in a disgruntled fashion though?

I was going to say in a Roco beard trimmer, but I got to get a haircut and I can't decide whether I should go super short on the sides, keep it long on top, and then just have the beard be big or do my normal thing where no matter what I do, it looks exactly the same. You know what I mean? I mean, it always looks awesome, though. Yeah.

I'm probably just going to go short, like just a little long on top, short on the sides. That's it. That's fun. I recently saw a video of us from a couple years ago. Yeah. We were in a cameo appearance in Cheap Cool Crazy. Oh, a little hit start. Start. That was a hit show. And uh there's a clip of me and you walking out of an elevator and we both look like we are 10.

My beard is so much better than I mean my non-beard. Does the wife like it? Uh she likes it. She doesn't like when it becomes unruly like it is right now. What's that where it's just creeping north?

We'll see next next week what I look like. Then I was going to say beardless, but you have a beard, too. The pure one, Tim Gettys. Tim, I like your shirt today. This is new. It's very nice. Yeah.
