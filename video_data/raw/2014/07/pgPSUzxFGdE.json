Um, enclosed in this package is a lot of good trill stuff. First off, the two fragile packages are Oreos for Greg to review if you would like to. Oh, the two flavors are fruit punch and watermelon. We do need to get both those on the oration, but you guys got to promise to watch them if I do. I am not sure if you guys have these by you or not. Also, I have not tried them yet, so I cannot tell you how they are. Not sure what Nabiscoco has been smoking lately, though. They've been smoking that green, that money. Yeah, get paid.
