Seal bag and chill chicken overnight.\n2) Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Let sit uncovered at room temperature 1 hour.\n3) Preheat oven to 400. Coat the cast-iron skillet with olive oil and place the chicken skin down in it. Put the skillet (with the chicken already in it) on the stove at medium-high heat. Cook until skin is browned and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Flip it over, kid!\n4) Roast chicken in oven, skin side up, until cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh registers 165\u00b0, 20\u201325 minutes. \nOriginal Bon Appetit Recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/firehouse-chicken\n\nINGREDIENTS FOR FIREHOUSE CHICKEN\n4 garlic cloves, chopped\n2 cups distilled white vinegar\n\u00bd cup olive oil\n\u00bc cup kosher salt\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley\n2 tablespoons paprika\n1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 cup vegetable oil, divided\n2 Bone-in chicken thighs\n2 Bone-in chicken breasts\n\nBRUSSELS SPROUTS STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS\n1) Preheat oven to 400 degrees.\n2) Got a bunch of Brussels sprouts?
