Which which means we are 13 days away from Sonic Mania. And let me tell you, I am damn excited for that because well, just because it's been a long time since we've we've had classic 2D Sonic. And man, Sonic Mania, I just feel like they're really going to knock it out of the park. Every they just every like week I think they've been releasing another song from the game, right?

You're saying that now? I'm saying it now. Best of all. I really think it's going to be I think and it's not even going to be close. Do you think that it's going to rate well with critics as well?

That sucks. Yeah. I mean, my hope here would be like because you're talking about Nintendo core games. Persona Q, not not a Nintendo game. Nintendo's not publishing that. This is Atlas/ Sega depending on, you know. Yeah. I mean, that's a valid point, but I still think that if we're going to get a Persona game on the Switch, I think it's either going to be a Switch version of Q, like a new like spin-off, but it is kind of a real game, but it's not a numbered core tile. uh either that for the Switch or it will be a Persona 5 remastered whatever I don't know",

I never got to play it since I only hopped on the train hype train with Persona 4 Golden. I would even settle for a PS2 to PS4 version with trophies. Just wanted to hear your thoughts. loving the new show. Keep up the great work, Chris. Thank you, Chris. Uh, I want to say yes, I love Persona 3.

The fact that they're doing five and three. Yeah. Three is still in their mind. Three is still valuable to them and something they want to invest time into. Will we get a golden type of PS?

This is where it gets a little murky in terms of like America verse Japan. In Japan, Persona's been a big deal forever. And so for me, like, you know, I love the cast of Persona 3. Some some people do. I don't think enough people in America or the West know about it. Right. In Japan, that's not a problem. The fact that Persona Q had the Persona 3 cast in it, there's an audience that knows them that way. Do they think they need to look back that far?

Super Mario Odyssey is rated E10 plus. This is all this broke via Go Nintendo. As they point out, as far as we can tell, this is the first mainline Mario entry to get an E10 plus rating from the ESRB. There are some other titles starring Mario that have gotten the rating before, like some of the Mario plus Mario Sonic games. I'm thinking that Newon City portion might play into the game's rating since it features human lifelike humans you can jump on. IGN chimes in. According to the ESRB's rating guide, then E10 plus is likely to contain quote more cartoon fantasy or mild violence, mild language, andor minimal suggestive themes than your garden variety. E.

It's It's interesting, but these ratings are so weirdly arbitrary and it's like more more is that what does that word mean? It contains more cartoon fantasy or violence. The difference between an E and an E10 plus is the word more. So, I don't know what does that mean for Mario. I think it's a really good um idea that it's because of the new Don City portion.

Not drastically, but it would have an effect. Whereas the E10 Plus, I'm like, \"Did you make that up just for this game?\" No, no, no. It's been around for a while. Remember before there there was that the K K to A was the kids to adults. Yeah. Like a long long time ago. I nailed it, but I left out early childhood. There's an EC that you never see on any game.

I don't think that that's a good thing. However, it does sell a lot of copies easily.

We've talked a lot about the gameplay of Insomniac Spider-Man, but what I want to know is this. What do you guys want out of the story of the game? I'd love to see some good storytelling that I that I feel like the Arkham games never really tried to do. They were definitely more concerned about the gameplay and just having a cool Batman story.

When I'm in the zone, I feel like I am on the battlefield alongside my eyeball compatriots wildly banging on drums, and they are asking me to break the immersion by throwing them my beats.

And it was just like, well, what what was like there was no driving force here. There was no fear in Gone Home, it was what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] going on? Is this house haunted? Did they kill each other? What's going on in the attic? Why can't I get in the attic? This is creepy. Blah blah blah. There was none of that here where this one was like by the time I got to the end and like you get into the ship and you put Odin back in. And then it's like the reveal was like I was uh you know, I'd taken this mission acting like I was going to be this corporate lackey and clean up their mess. But I get back in, I'm actually like part of the AI liberation front where I put him in and I'm like, \"We're going to take you off and be\" and I",

How's this going to wrap up? What are they going to do?\" But I cared way more about the people, but I was never worried about the people because of the way the game was set up. Yeah. So, it was this interesting of like it succeeds on a story front, I think, because I cared about all the characters, but it fails in a story because I guess I I missed that the over the real point of the game was going to be this corporation's trying to [\u00a0__\u00a0] you guys and we're trying to save the AI and I didn't get that away from it. I was more interested in all the people like when there's this explosion and Nat and Bert get knocked down and they I was like,",

Oh, well, if we put Nat in cryo, she might die. No, we're not going to do that. She's fine. Like, all right, whatever. whiny ass dude over here with his kid or whatever. I'm like, I don't care about you. You suck. You didn't want to get get into cryo faster. You know what I mean? But again, to the point, I'm way more invested in the story that I have problems with than I am in most AAA stories with the exception of like the entire Uncharted series or something to that effect where I find characters and things I love about. But even that, I'm like, well, Lazar Lazarovich is a dumb boss. That's the thing is, I mean, man, it's so hard to talk about this stuff because plot and story are different things, right?

M like when story brings into consideration all like character development and characters and liking the characters. So it's like it sounds like Tacoma did have a good story. It didn't have a good plot because at the end of the day it's like the narrative of what's happening this then this then this then this then this that wasn't satisfying because of the end having well having the ending spoiled. The game I feel like spoils it end cuz like I'm there to figure out what went wrong on the ship and why it's happening and you get to the end like all right well that wasn't like the most crazy thing or whatever. Great whatever. Yeah. I don't know.

The point of Assassin's Creed, Spider-Man, whatever is a million other things and mainly that you're having fun playing the game and doing a million different things. Yeah, the story just helps to push those elements to be even more fun, right? Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, I've already done the outro. This has been the kind of funny Games Cast. Thank you for watching. Uh we're going to pop over. or if you're watching live right now, pop it. We're going to end it, of course, for the YouTube podcast, folks. Thanks for listening or watching, and then I'll do the subs and tips we missed during it. But until next time, I'm all choked up over Tacoma and B. No, but it's been our pleasure to serve you.",
