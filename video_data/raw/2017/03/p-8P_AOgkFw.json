They got socks, shirts, undershirts, hoodies, sweatpants, and the most comfortable underwear Mush has ever had the pleasure of meeting. Most importantly, they're all about comfort. So, if you don't like your first pair, you can keep it and then they'll still refund you, no questions asked. Here's one of the coolest things. They have a line of silver underwear and shirts that are naturally antimicrobial. That's a fancy word that means it eliminates odor. So, it'll probably help people. Like I'm not going to name any names like Kevin or anything, but it'd probably help him. It's good for working out, going to work, going on dates. You know, I'm not really sure there's any situation they aren't great for. At least any situation that requires wearing underwear. You know, you feel me? Talking about sex.

I I also don't really besides getting views and clicks which you respect you like the hustle. You like the hustle. I appreciate I mean hey we're we're doing this topic so it's the same thing but there's no real reason to review consoles like especially like when they first come out like what are you reviewing necessarily? Well I mean that's the thing about it in general just I don't we are lucky now the way that even when we're like we're reviewing a game like we did you know the horizon review.

Colin hasn't started it cuz he didn't. We only got the two switches. He wants to play on his own unit and like you and I are the units we bought. We're just giving it kind of funny to have units or stuff like that. Um, it's a weird thing and I don't know and it is weird to phrase it. I mean, basically what people what it is is that and I'm the same way. When I went to IGN today, I was like, \"Oh, Nintendo Switch review. Open new tab.\" Okay, cool. Review in progress.

What's the number then? Um, if I remember correctly, it was 6.9. What? Oh, Fran Fran Fran. Oh, seven. I know. That's what I'm saying. 69's a bit more fun. Nah, you feel me? I do feel you. Um, yeah, but it's like for us that the problem is that they are serving a different kind of audience, our audience, cuz you're the best friends and the best human beings in the world. You're out here and you like to listen to us ramble and talk and just give the opinion. When I go to IGN and it's, no offense to Vince, it's a really long review and I have 5 minutes before the Kind of funny morning show.

And you know what you're not getting. But to give the Nintendo Switch a 6.7, it it's just so weird to me because do I agree with that? I don't disagree with it. You know, right now it is kind of an empty system that doesn't have a lot of features that the other consoles have and all these, but it's like putting a number to the review of a console that doesn't even have its internet, doesn't even have anything.

I'm fine with I know Colin is vehematly against I don't like it either, but but I understand the purpose, which is different. I I think that like in certain in certain ways the number can make sense. I think this is one of those where I'm like, no, there's no point in putting uh a grade to something right now at the end of its life cycle, we'll be able to look at the Nintendo Switch and be like, well, that's the whole point with consoles in general, right? Like, I mean, mainly you want to know, is it work? Is it it broken? What's the problems? And I know that's why like the tweets have been going around so much of like the Joy-Cons getting",

Do I understand what you're saying? Where it is, okay, what does it matter? Like even when I think, you know, I think when I think of reviews, right, and consoles, I think a lot of like when Fran reviewed Xbox One and like that's where the gift of him working out in the connect, isn't it? Or was it he reviewed? He used that in that. But but no, that was that. But that's the thing of like 360 actually for the connect fitness. There it is. But he did review Xbox One, right?

And it's like I get it from the the point of again as a company, as somebody that makes content talking about things and giving opinion opinions on things. I get IGN doing it. It's a piece of content people want to see and I guarantee they're going to do five more. They're going to do it yearly where Nintendo Switch 2017 review, whatever. just keep going cuz that's where we're at and there's an audience for that.

I've never done that. I'm never going to do that. So, like again, here's my thing, and I I keep kind of reiterating the same point, but this system has a lot of faults.

I'm sure we're going to get Smash at some point and it's like, all right, cool. All the things that I love my Wii U for, I'm going to love this thing for, but I am going to get to enjoy all the VA indie games uh on one console, you know? I mean that that would be the promise of this device and especially if we're going to keep comparing to the VA, right? Is that it's it's not and it can't be Vita because Nintendo can't abandon it.

Uh but anyway, that's all exciting. But there is there is little things that do bother me like the kickstand. It's going to break. It's gonna break. Is it because it feels great so far? Really? Yeah. I I mean I keep I keep expecting it to be more wobbly than it is. Yeah. I mean it it holds the thing upgrade, but I'm saying like that thing's going to be pop back in. I gave it a month. Oh, wait. Well, I mean, I don't think I use it that often. Yeah. And that's the whole thing is there's so many use cases to this thing of like how like we're talking",

It looks like a pixel junk game, so cartoony and bright, but it has the dash ability of like, you know, uh a housemart game or something like that.

The Microsoft spokesperson also clarified the Xbox Game Pass catalog will update every month. Only quote unquote sometimes will games be removed. So very similar to Netflix. Sure. Where every month something something's leaving and something's coming. Yeah. Yeah. Something's always happen. You'll be able to play all the games in the library for as long as you remain a subscriber.

It doesn't just feel like you're playing Gone Home again and space. Yeah. Yeah. And and so like finding uh Yeah. I mean space was our we were like what if we just put it in space? Yeah. We just do Gone Home in Space. It",

We just do Gone Home in Space. It wasn't quite enough there. Not I mean it was close. It was almost right. But we needed that little extra um and so Steve Gainer magic and so for us Yeah. the the whole um the AR figures kind of surrounding you and you being able to move through the timeline and move around the space while these scenes are going on. It kind of speaks to what Gone Home is about, which is like piecing together all these disperate elements of the narrative, but not in the same way that that we did before, but in a way that like compliments it. So, like finding finding what that what our version of that was took a while. It was it was hard, but I I don't know. I think we got to a place where where it hits that balance.

You did the presentation there and it went flawlessly from the very beginning. Don't believe anything you're in the internet. It was beautiful. What I liked about it was you asked who was a dev in the audience and can kind of just be devy about this rather than explain the game and demo the game, talk about the you know things and I one of the things like you talking about challenges you faced. I thought it was so fascinating that I never would have thought of of you know what's in the let's play. We should probably put the let's play up next Wednesday that way there people have reference for this on Thursday.

Yeah. I mean the the technical challenge is the other side of it cuz like we as a studio haven't done characters before you know and and these are sort of these abstracted characters you know like I mean on screen like I know exactly what you mean but it just sounds funny like we made games with no characters beautiful worlds for you house and some crap I don't know um but we haven't like put characters on screen before and so um the the just the the how and why and saying like yeah oh okay so we want you to be able to move past these these figures while they're doing their thing, but then you're like, \"Oh, but part of",

So, we can do it this way.\" And that that works great, you know, and but it's not something that you kind of come to it as a solved problem, which is, you know, makes it fun. Of course. I'm sure it's great when you're slamming your head against your desk. It's not fun until it is fun. Pablo Lopez has a good question. With Tacoma, what emotions would you like your audience to experience and how are you going to exceed the bar that the Gone Home has set? Well, don't [\u00a0__\u00a0] this up. All eyes on you.

I mean, I think that the the the biggest thing for us is um you know, I I think that part of the the gambit of trying to change Tacoma fairly significantly in form from Gone Home was to kind of get out of that mindset of being like, okay, well, we got to do that again but better, or we got to like take what we did and like one up it, right? So I think that what was that what people connected with in Gone Home was like the very onetoone specific personal connection with like this one character that that the the main story was all about. And for us, the challenge was to say, okay, we, you know, we've done that. We we kind of know how to make this like single story thread about this person. And we wanted to say, can we make a game that's about understanding this entire crew as a community, you know, like as a group, as a small kind of almost like a like a family",

And so, I hope that in the same way, you get to know these characters and think of them as like people that you could know in your real life. and and care about what happens to them. But also, you know, I don't think it's on our checklist to be like, \"And how do we make people cry twice as hard?\" But, um, but I I I think that, you know, when you have a game like this, you give people access to to all the evidence of people's kind of personal lives and you flesh that out that hopefully it's natural to like make a connection with them.

I Well, I guess for me, I think that like just the fact that we kind of moved away from Gone Home's like very specific structure for Tacoma is cuz I felt like we as developers couldn't kind of just go back to that and say like, well, it's that, but it's a different places, different story, different stuff you're finding.

Uh, so Rain City Gamers has a question that is very relevant to you since last time on I think it was Gamescast. We talked extensively about VR and we thought right want to see if there's any update here. Any chance we'll see Tacoma or Gone Home supporting PSVR after the success of Resident Evil 7? I mean the for me I think that honestly Resident Evil 7 I found kind of like encouraging because obviously from its starting point traditional first person game but then I was really I I I I was like oh wow um to see how positive people were about the the VR version. They were like oh yeah this is a great way to play this game which I don't feel like we've seen very many like full first person games that people feel that",

They were like oh yeah this is a great way to play this game which I don't feel like we've seen very many like full first person games that people feel that way about in VR. There's there's so many you know technical challenges and requirements to do that. So for me it's always been like we only want to do a version of the game if it's actually going to be a great version and not like a shoehorned version or whatever. Um so just seeing how the the design knowledge and technique has uh uh evolved over the last few years does kind of make me feel a little bit more like well maybe sometime you know down the road maybe we should give that another you know see if there's something there. Um cuz you think it could be interesting. Like there's there's something cool about like the kind of tangibility of of being, you know, like there in the space, right? I don't think so.

But like that said, if there's a great way to do it and it's like a cool new way to experience it, like we'll see. Maybe we when we have kind of more time in front of us, maybe you're flip-flopping.
