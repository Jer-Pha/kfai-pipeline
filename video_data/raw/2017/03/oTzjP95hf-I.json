But Nick was telling me about doing the show with this guy named Greg and Tim for years and he was working working at IGN. And Nick and I like we're we're very good friends, but we only see each other like once or twice a year. So every time we do it's like a big download. And Nick's like I was really proud of him. Moved up to San Francisco working at IGN balling. I was doing well with my IT career. So I'm like you know and then he starts telling me about this YouTube stuff he's doing. And I'm a I loved YouTube at the time. I'm a big car guy. So I was like I liked YouTube but I still didn't really understand what he was doing. And I was like oh okay.

I was like, \"Dude, what is Nick doing?\" I'm like, \"That's terrible. This is kind of crazy, bro.\" Yeah. But no healthcare. Terrible. No. Okay. But, uh, he seemed really happy and you know, Danielle's a smart woman and she supported you. I was like, \"All right, do it, dude. That sounds great.\" So, it wasn't until I watched kind of funny live, the first one, where I realized what the hell you guys have done, and I'd like to pat all of you guys on the back. Thank you, Nick. Yeah, give me a moment. Pound it. Um Colin, yeah, I was going to say air pass to Colin. Um because I couldn't believe and Kev too, bro. Um the support you guys had from your fans.

So, like from there on and Nick has been telling me, \"Dude, you you like cars. You're always doing cars stuff and spending money on cars. You should like start a YouTube channel.\" I was like, \"Haha.\" And then like would say it multiple times and I would never really click.

Just been a thing. kind of superficial, but you know, I've always liked it and always stayed with me throughout the years, except for about like a three-year period where I just drove a stock car. No cars. No cars. I was like, I need a break. But now I'm back. Okay. Um I just love them. So Volkswagen Audi is kind of what I grew up and doing. And like there's a big like a VW Beetle.

It's like a go-kart except it's like ugly and orange. Well, they were they were super easy to like fix apparently. The Beatles just weren't that that that complex of a car. So, a lot of people liked them because it was like if it broke down, you fix them pretty easily or you can do it yourself. Um I we had a couple friends in high schools that had Beatles and it was always and they broke a lot. Yeah, they broke a lot.

It was an 84 Volkswagen Jetta. Not anywhere near as cool as he's making out to see but probably I've never associated Jetta in cool. Like you never see a Jetta in Need for Speed Underground. Like we have a but Jesse drove a Jetta in uh in Fast and Furious. Yeah. Yeah, Jesse did. Fair enough. Touche. Touche. You kind of look like Jesse actually. No. But uh uh but Stu had this car and I was like so jealous because he tinted it out. He put the CAN&N air filter in it. He like lowered it. Did all this stuff.

And I remember there was one time when Steu and I were driving and I was like, \"Steu, that's a stop sign. Steu, you blew through the stop sign.\" And he goes, \"Bro, I can't stop. If I if I stop the car, it'll stall and we'll have to push it.\" Cruise three. Oh, dude. Right. No, it would not. It wasn't three. This is the thing with cars and stuff, and I want to get to your fancy YouTube channel. fancy cars, but the fact of like what you just said, were Jetta cool?

I'm like that looks like the Batmobile, so that's fine. Sick. It got real ugly after 98, but then but then it came back and I was like, man, but that was the thing is I drove a Ford Taurus forever and I like that that was the beater I got when I turned 16 and I that car was great cuz it was the perfect car for me. And the fact of like it was totally [\u00a0__\u00a0] up so nobody really cared what happened to it. Like Po always jokes around about it when he'd come over to get a ride to school.

It's got to be the right sequence of orders. How long did you keep that car? I had that car from high school until I graduated college like 90. Well, I guess I not right away. So, or 20 200 to 2005 or six, we'll say something like that probably something like that. And what happened is I had this Taurus that I inherited from my parents that by the time I'm getting rid of it in Missouri, the deal was that it ate oil. Like, and my dad is Mr. car, Mr. Outside guy.

So, when you fill up for gas, you need to put a quarter oil in every time. And I was like, \"Okay, cool.\" And like you did, and it just disappeared. And so, finally, my mom was getting rid of the the burning it. That's crazy. Yeah. Mom had this 1994 rag top Ford Mustang GT. She loved it. Took such great care of it. Leather interior, tan tan top, like pristine. And she was like finally like, you know, it was only, you know, rear wheel drive. So, it like kicked out all the time in the winter and it was a huge thing. So, she was moving over to some similar looking car but much bigger. A solar I think maybe if that makes sense. Toyota, something like that. Doesn't matter. And so, she was going to do that and she called me was like, \"Do you want to do you want the Mustang?\" like I'll you know I'll sell you the most",

Like car is way better than your piece of [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm like all right cool. So I got it and there's like you know again it's funny with Ste. We're talking about post so much. My you know high school best friend, childhood best friend. Um he always talks about it being like my he remembers that car and how my mom took care of it and then when I picked him up in it at uh SFO one year when when I had out here he said it was like Ghostbusters 2 when the Ecto1 comes in it's like filth fan cutting kicking out smoke cuz I I would park it and then like tree sap and tar would fall on it and I wouldn't do anything about it.

Greg, come on. Well, that's what that's funny that you said cuz my I used to treat my cars like [\u00a0__\u00a0] Like I I I always had crap in my cars and it wasn't until Stu got a a newer car.

It would be heartbreaking for me to go through like buy a brand new Audi or something like that and then just see like the bumper systematically over a span of a year just get [\u00a0__\u00a0] up. It would be terrible. That makes sense. I'm also just not a car guy so who cares. And you're you're with your previous I I am in love. What do you drive with a car? No. Zero bike out there. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. I uh when I those quads Yeah. And trust me, today was a great example of how bad the weather's been cuz like like leading I bought the bike uh like September of last year or whatever and rode for a bunch and then like the holidays",

But no, uh, yeah, when I moved here, I moved here with the Mustang and then eventually was like sold this. But when I moved downtown and Ain was moving downtown, I was like, \"Well, I can walk to work.\" Do you use like Zip Car or any of those like I use Zip? Yeah, I'll do Zip. Yeah.

Kind of funny. That was the thing of like never again, you know what I mean? cuz we were working from home and then when we came here the bike offsets it enough but yeah no I I love my Prius C but there was a time like when I didn't when I wasn't able to get a car and it was just like whatever car was literally given to me for free. Uh I was just like all right what cars do I want? All my friends had cool cars and my friends were really into into that whole that scene. Um so they they all had like RSXs and the the STI and all that stuff and they they modified it and did all that. I knew I didn't want any of that, but I was like, I would give anything for a a 98 to 2003 Mustang cuz that's just [\u00a0__\u00a0] dope. A 98 Eclipse or a 2001 Celica was my",

A 98 Eclipse or a 2001 Celica was my like cuz there is no blue more obnoxious than my Prius C blue than the 2001 Celica blue. The word Celica is just obnoxious. Oh, I love the Celica. It looks like the Pokemon Scyther if it was a car. And it's just the [\u00a0__\u00a0] best thing ever. It's like that thing. Oh, it's so dope. So [\u00a0__\u00a0] dope. I feel like the Prius C is like the less cool version. Like if you took uh the 2001 Celica and just kind of like squished it together. That's what a Prius C is. I've never heard it described that way. Probably never will get there. No, it is. If you look at them visually, like you can there was like definitely a through line of Toyota being like, \"All right, we're going to have some things and like gag.\" It's like it's it's there.

No. No. Colin doesn't have a license. Uh before that a guy named Scott Brammley lived there and Brmley had a truck and he parked the truck he had agreement with the landlord to park it in the driveway and he did and then just never moved it for months. So when Brmley left a landlord was like and also no more parking in the driveway for anyone. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for watching. You can subscribe to the channel here.
