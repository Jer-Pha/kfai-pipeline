Earlier this week, retailer GameStop announced that it received a new shipment of Nintendo Switch systems and would make them available starting on Wednesday, March 22nd. It seems some stores have started selling their stock early as one online as online reports claim the systems are being sold in store right now. People at NeoAF are reporting that their local stores received 10 units and they're being sold right now, including at least one in Houston, Texas.

If you're willing to part with your gaming hardware, you could get a Nintendo Switch for well below its $300 price point. GameStop is paying $150 for instore credit for Wii U and 3DS systems, 151 175 for Xbox One, 200 for PlayStation 4 when you apply that to the purchase of a Nintendo Switch, which means you could get the hybrid console for $100 to $150. The special trade-in promotion is good until March 26th. Quote, \"The customer enthusiasm and response we've seen so far to Nintendo Switch has been incredible as we continue to sell through our supply of systems.\" GameStop merchandising director Eric Bright said in a statement this week, \"We strongly suggest any customer who is still looking to purchase a Nintendo Switch visit one of our stores soon as they can.

So, I was like, \"Now I got to leave and go explore the rest of the game.\" But I feel like I've lost ground. That's my problem. So, I mean, I'll take it as it goes.

It's more of just a cat and mouse game between him and and L. So, um I think this is exactly what I want this to be. I think it's very Americanized.
