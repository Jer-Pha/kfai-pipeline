So, I mean, if you're talking Upright Citizens Brigade, I believe there's there's only a handful of really awesome improv troops that like feed into SNL and places like that, like u uh Mad TV, SNL, um all those places. like they usually pick from like either UCB groundlings or um Second City in Chicago. So like Second City for instance, Bill Murray came from um what we call John Belalushi came from all those guys.

So, if you guys are turned off by the concept of like a slasher horror movie, this is not that. This is a very unique and cool like take on that genre. So definitely go check it out if you haven't seen it already. Like I, you know, I always get a little turned off when something like is that successful? I'm like, okay, it can't be.

Like I talked to to Joe after the show and I was like, \"Dude, congratulations.\" Like, and he won a belt, which is hilarious. Um, from one champion to another. What up, Joe?
