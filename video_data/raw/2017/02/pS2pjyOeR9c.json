What I've done here is I've done I've dimmed my computer too much and now I can't see it. Ah, that's the worst when you dim the computer too much. You got it's a fine line to walk with screen brightness. I'll tell you it's it vacasillates. I also enjoy your new mouse pad here. Well, it's a note I was going to read. Let's Let's get into that right now. Oh, okay. Wow. A gentleman from Bill Raa, which is a place in Massachusetts. From Bill Rick. Okay. Sent me the following note. Says, \"Hey, Colin. This is to celebrate the one small bright spot in the otherwise dismal year of Jets football. Thank you for all of the content. This is from General Lee or Jen Lee. Jen gn you know a Jen.

So, I mean obviously you can't really rock a Leverius cold jersey anymore. You can throwback style. That's like something you see a homeless man wear.

They didn't realize that I was wearing a real Jim Miller jersey. I wonder, you know, they got a cut of every jersey they sold. And I wonder if he that was the only jersey he ever sold was the one I got him I got him on clearance from Dick Sporting Goods I think in the suburbs of Chicago where Pat Non was working.

First thing I did was boot up both PS4s, sync the trophies, and then beat the final corrupted zone for me. Pop the platinum on that. I was super excited about that.

I'm telling you directly. Well, anyways, I Colin, we were talking about Horizon Zero Dawn. I got three Horizon Zero Dawn questions from kind of funny.com/psq. You ready? Chris Brown says, \"Hi Colin and Greg. Is Horizon Zero Dawn worth getting for those of those of us who don't get along with open world games?\" to give you an idea of my relationship with open world games. I used to consider myself to be a huge Metal Gear Solid fan, having played all the games from 1 to 4, many times, but I got to the point where I just didn't care anymore. The story was not progressing anywhere near the pace I wanted, and there was so much stuff that I really had no interest in doing",

Having watched your review of Horizon Zero Dawn, you were both obviously quite taken with the game and make it sound like a must have title. I'm very concerned that if I spend what is now a small fortune to buy the game parenthesis the price of gains jumped massively when the exchange rate to South Africa a African rand went south but hasn't dropped at all now that it's mostly recovered I'll end up getting bogged down in the open worldness of the game and just stop playing it before I get to the end of what sounds like an excellent story the same way I will never finish Muggarot 5.

Uh, but that's if you wanted to do everything. Game took 30 35 hours or whatever. Again, with a fair amount of digging around Tim in the other room playing like Uncharted, story to story, doing all this different stuff. I'm sure at some point, yes, there will be.

And I especially don't like these dense open worlds as I've said many times, you know, at I can beat the game right now in probably an hour if I wanted to. So, that would put me at like a little below 45 hours. Um, I played Witcher for 45 hours or so and got almost nowhere. So, I've done literally everything in the game. And by the way, man, I I I there's a whole there's the combat in that game really. There's a whole different layer to the combat when you really get into it.

Use the fire arrows, electricity arrows at whatever their weakness is, bring them down, then get out the the strong arrows. Yeah. Hardened arrows, take off their plating, find their weak spots, destroy them. Very satisfying. Very Monster Hunteresque. Yeah. Yeah. 100%. Next, but not as [\u00a0__\u00a0] nerdy. Next. Next Horizon Zero Dawn question comes from Lex Caliber. Hey, Greg and Colin. With your recent review of Horizon Zero Dawn, I think it's fair to say Guerilla has made a massive leap in terms of their standing in the industry. They're now on a different level. Sony seems to have talent for allowing developers to achieve their potential. Naughty Dog,",

Sony seems to have talent for allowing developers to achieve their potential. Naughty Dog, Sucker Punch, and now Guerilla all seem to be examples of developers who have progressed from good to incredible. My question is, what do you think Sony's special sauce is here? How do they take these developers and give them the help they need to become some of the best in the industry? I think the answer is TLC. I think it's time. I think it's focus. This is what we always talk about. Exactly. It's taking people and incubating them. I think for any developer who's going to be working on multiple games on multiple SKs, that's when it gets cumbersome and tiring and you how you can you have to build for the base level of it. You have to sit there and say, \"I'm making this game. So, if Xbox 360 is the top of the line and that's as high as I go, that's as high as I can And if if PlayStation 4 is",

That's what it's going to be. But it if I have to take into account that it's the best over here looking on PlayStation 4, but how do I dial it down for Xbox One or vice versa, however you want to go. PC gaming getting mixed. You get things that don't necessarily run or look as great as they should. When you can give somebody like Naughty Dog, you say, \"All right, cool. Make Last of Us on just the PlayStation 3, then bring it over to PlayStation 4 eventually.\" You give them focus, you give them time, you give them room to grow, and that's what it is. Yeah, I mean, I agree. I have nothing else really to add to that other than the fact that it's just it is kind of incredible when you compare Sony's first party to Microsoft's first party",

Like I don't think that that's true. I think what they do is they retain gamers um and make it make them interested. The attach rates high, all that kind of stuff. So, I think I think Call of Duty and Destiny got way more players into the door PS4 than Horizon, Uncharted, and every other exclusive will ever do combined probably, but they stay sure because of the first party support that's just not there.

These are happening at the exact same time and that's bad news for Microsoft. Not to be a, you know, a fanboy or a pat on the back or anything weird like that.

Obviously, that connected with a whole generation of people, but as those people have grown up, they're looking for video games that reflect the more mature themes. And I'm not saying we're [\u00a0__\u00a0] looking at high art sometimes here, but Last of Us's story, the the character relations of Uncharted, even what's going to happen in Horizon when you play Horizon, that tantalizing thing that isn't just gameplay, isn't just adrenaline fil.

Gears of War, Halo, these aren't going to make the impact of a journey. They're not going to make the impact of the story of The Last of Us. And that's because I feel like Sony has matured with gamers, if that makes sense. I also think that Microsoft has hedged its bets a lot by using second party support. And so, and so those games, you know, Sony has plenty of second party games, too, but actually more actually there, too. But, but they pan out better. uh it seems like and at least have a little bit more resonance.

Even without a PlayStation exclusive lineup, Sony, for the most part, managed to dominate the past three holiday seasons, relying on thirdparty support. So far, the majority of first and second party PlayStation 4 titles have managed to come out somewhere between February and May. See list below. He went through and listed them throughout the years. I'm not saying that Sony isn't concerned with the holiday lineup, but maybe it just isn't as important as it used to be.

The New York Times reports that Sony has sold 915,000 VR units as of February 19th. Sony's original projection was that it would take them 6 months to do a million units. February 19th marks the fourth month PSVR was on the market. The New York Times notes sales predictions of 243,000 for Oculus Rift and 420,000 for HTC Vive, meaning PSVR is beating both of its competitors combined.

Colin stated that Game Informer's continued relevance is largely due to GameStop's instore subscription service. While this may help the sales of the magazine, I disagree that this has much to do with Game Informer's relevance. I can't speak to the magazine sales itself. However, Game Informer staff writes some great articles and features, makes great video content, and fosters a pretty big community, not unlike all the best friends.
