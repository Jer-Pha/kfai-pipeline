I enjoy your views on politics and your enthusiasm for science. Nick, thank you for saying what we all think. Kevin, keep being gorgeous. Thanks for all the tips. Thank you. TheShayZ1 says, Hey guys, great show. Hopefully, meeting Greg and Tammit RTX Sydney over the next two days. Wish you were all here. Colin, you're an inspiration to everything I do. Thank you for Kinda Funny and Kevin. See, there's a lot of people that never hear that. Kevin, I'm an inspiration to everything this man does. Okay. That's heavy stuff when you think about it, isn't it? Sure is. It depends on what he's doing. Not as heavy as the omelet I'm going to eat",

John Kohler of our PlayStation blog writes PS4 system software update 4.50 features details. So this is the new software update. It's not five which is interesting. So the big thing here is that you can now use external hard drives. This is going to be a big thing that took them for some reason three and a half years to put on their console. Couldn't you already do that? No. So you'd need a USB 3.0 HDD and you can plug it in and then you'll have extra space if you want to do that. You can remove and replace your hard drive internally. You have custom wallpapers, there's a quick menu refresh, simplified notification list, etc. So nothing too crazy, nothing too big and kind of boring. But nonetheless",

Over at Xbox Wire, Fallout Shelter is coming to Xbox One and Windows PC or Windows 10 next week. That's a pretty... What happened? Oh no. You said it very... I know you were very like emphatic about... What happened? Nothing happened. I jokingly said finally. Oh finally. I see. Very disruptive. Oh Jesus God. Oh God. I can't breathe. Anyway, Fallout Shelter is coming to Xbox One and Windows. Let's just go to the final story please. All right. Oh my God. And finally, Nier Automata has gone gold. The game comes out March 7th for PlayStation 4. It will come onto PC later in the year. People are super excited about this. Obviously this is a Square Enix published game developed by Platinum.",

Shall we give something away, Nick? Sure. That sounds fun. As you all know here, we have a long-standing tradition of giving away garbage to people, but we've changed that because apparently people... They were fine with the garbage that we were giving them. They just weren't okay with the fact that it took 18 to 24 months to get the garbage. What were you using? Like Pony Express or whatnot? Yeah. The United States Postal Service. Oh, so pretty much the same thing. We would go every maybe six months. Yeah. Can we just stack up the packages and be like... Again, I did not understand.

In the early 1970s, Geller became a superstar, the most famous psychic in the world. And then of course, there was Mr. Geller's appearance on The Tonight Show. You don't fuck with Carson.
