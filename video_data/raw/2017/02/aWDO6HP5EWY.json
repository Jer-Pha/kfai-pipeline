What's up everybody? Welcome to the Game Over Gregi Show. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the producer slash seducer, Nick Scarpino. Your hair is on point today, Greg. Thank you very much. Yours as well. Here's the thing is I like that you're wearing the Beat Cop shirt. I like you're still rolling the sleeves. I'm not sure how I feel about the coconut oil in the coffee. Yeah, it's a little weird. It is overpowering. I'm like, where are the mounds bars? Who's eating the mounds bars? No, it's coconut in the coffee. Can we see it? Yeah, there's a little flex in there. You might be able to see a little bit of it. Can you? Careful, it's hot. No, you",

Careful, it's hot. No, you can't really make it out. So you have to be careful with the coconut oil. As a lot of you know, I'm flirting with the ketogenic diet and one of the things I recommend getting healthy fats, one being MCT oil. What you can get is you can get these coconut oil packets that you put in your coffee instead of a creamer so you're not getting dairy. The problem is, in a cup of coffee this big, they give you a packet that's literally the size of a hot sauce container. If you pour the whole thing in, the first inch of your coffee will just be oil. And I almost gagged it the other day. This is approximately like a quarter of the container. Now I got to ask too, is this making you poop? Like really the liquidy poops?

That's not the problem. The problem is the poop is too solid when you do only protein. Like I said before, remember I said it's like pushing peanut butter through a thimble? It's just disgusting. It's like you got to just scrape it out, just scrape it out. And this is the Tonton Master, Colin Moriarty. Tonton? Yeah. Or Tonton? I don't know. Are you a Tonton Wrangler? Tonton from Star Wars?

We've said this on the morning show and you'll hear it on the Gamescast, but for the first time ever, kind of funny, we recorded an entire episode of the Gamescast and then the audio corrupted. It's terrible. So it's unusable. And it was one with Pete Hines, a very special guest. It was a great... Such a good episode. I have to say, Greg will do his best in the interview. I'm sure it won't be nearly as good as the episode that we had. The episode was great. We were all firing on all the film. It was great. It was a fantastic and fascinating conversation that you will literally never see. But we're trying to make it up. So Greg's doing a one-on-one. I feel really good about it. You just can't hear it.

Hello, Mario? This table. My topic is how long will Donald Trump be president? Last week on the Game Over Gregory show, we did the topic where, hey, let's go through his policies. He just got elected and see what we agree with and what we don't agree with. We reported that on Tuesday. And then by the end of the week, everything was on fire.

Sean Spicer saying all sorts of crazy shit, tweeting his passwords maybe. Nobody knows what's happening. He got banned over there. People are calling him president. It's just like, Jesus fucking Christ, what the hell is happening anymore? And so it's funny because Colin wanted to do the topic about the policies so that it would have gone live on Patreon. They got inaugurated and then it would have rolled out through the week. I wanted to do this topic of how long will he be president? And I think all of them, we were hot on the trigger finger for each one of them because he could be, I can see him being president for eight full years.

He can just do whatever the shit he wants. I don't know, man. Like this, it's so interesting to see over the last couple of years how this all came to be. And now we are dealing with it. And I honestly with as upset as everyone is about things, it's like who didn't see this type of thing coming? Like, I think that this is what people voted for. So as upset as we are all are, that again, our political leanings, that's just that showing. And it's the same echo chamber that everyone always was talking about.

The president of America is causing these things to happen and the media can say whatever they want and we can say whatever we want. Anyone on Twitter and Facebook and say whatever they want. This is happening. It's fucking happening. We're locked in. We're on the rollercoaster. The things come down and locked. So we got our chance to get off. I don't know. I mean, how long do you think it'll be president? I do. I honestly think that it's going to take someone trying to kill him to stop him from being president. I think, I think eight years.

I don't necessarily think that that's something that's going to be an ongoing policy and Colin can probably speak a little more to this, but I'm assuming when the Supreme Court gets involved that it's not going to be, it's not going to fly for very much longer. What I think he's really doing is I think he's smartly just absolutely pandering to his base. He sees all those people that got elected. He's saying, look, I'm doing all these things that you want me to do, whether or not they're lasting. I don't think he cares. I don't think there's anything.

As long as someone starts, as long as they start building the wall, that's all, that's all they really need. But I don't, I don't see, you know, it's very difficult to judge this because like Tim was saying, we are caught in our liberal echo chamber, which is on Twitter, right? We've chosen to follow people who believe what we believe. So oftentimes you have to be very careful not to think, hey, everyone in the world believes this, how come this is happening?

There's a lot of people out there that are just like Trump's only president go about my day. And I saw, I forget, I was looking at before this, but I couldn't find it.

And we need to see that every day until, you know, those people in those, that other, you know, percentile of America gets out there and votes in the midterm or in the mid day. I think it's cool to see even companies take stands as companies like Ted Price coming out with that's such a bold move. And I think it's a very powerful step that it's not a publicity stunt.

You look at the countries that you, everyone I'm sure saw the chart that came out that said all seven of the countries that people are banned from coming aren't countries that Trump does business in. But then, you know, Saudi Arabia, UAE, all these other companies that he does have hotels or something, countries, that he has hotels in aren't banned, right. Even though they are predominant, there are, there is evidence that terrorism has come from those countries. Well sure, like 9-11. Exactly. And so that's insidious, right. And that makes you scared.

So, so I don't know how much of this is going to be shocking, and then settle and then we're just status quo for the next four years, versus how much of this, you know, to Trump's credit, what this has done is it has highly politicalized a lot of people that otherwise I don't think would be paying attention right now. And that's, it's not a good thing, but at least I still care.

I agree with Nick that the ceiling is eight years. And it's important to note, I think, and Tim was saying this, I think it's an important, an important point and a good point to start is, Rasmussen, which is a right-leaning but a respected pollster, released a poll about the immigration ban. 57% of Americans agree with it. Only 35% of Americans don't. So while I'm not saying anyone's right or wrong, this goes to speak to the fact that even with all of that, all the bad",

I read a couple other polls that were, that backed that up as well. It wasn't quite that, that much majority, but it was 48 to I think 32 or something like that. Right. Like what shows in both Rasmussen and the polls, you're citing that there's a huge swath of people like you were saying that are disaffected or just don't know or don't care. And that there's reasons for that. We can talk about that. But what I'm saying is that right or wrong, there's some stuff in the executive order I'm fine with. We talked about that last week, right?

For instance, last week's episode when we talked about, you know, about Trump and all the policies, all that, all you have to do is read the comments. I read the comments this morning. I watched that episode again. I usually watch the political episodes again and just be like, how do I come off? What, what is said, what is interesting and salient here? And it was a totally reasonable conversation. If you read the comments, you would think that we were talking about terrible things and saying terrible things, but we weren't. Yeah.

It's a long four years because of this response we're getting and the way people are talking to each other. But I think on top of that, the response is illustrative of the fact that like, we can't have conversations. We can't find middle ground. We can't like anything Donald Trump does is bad.

And so we could have honest discussions about the good things and the bad things that happen out of this and the fitness of the people that he puts in the place. I think Sean Spicer, for instance, is just not a good press secretary. I can't imagine he's going to last more than a few more months. You need good press secretaries.

It's still not working and it won't work. Look at the polling, right? Yeah, he's unpopular with, you know, he's underwater in terms of his popularity rating, but it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Like he's still the president. That's not a reason to remove him or a way to remove him. You attack the policies and the things that he does wrong and his fitness and you get somewhere.

And they found all these things were slowly amassed over many decades is a situation where it's like, well, I can sign this order because of this. I can sign this particular order because you said this in the seventies. And this is why, like, I don't believe in a powerful executive in the United States because this is not the design.

So, now I'm not saying a great player in hockey doesn't make your team better. What I'm saying is you're rolling four lines in a hockey game, you know? There are literally 22 players on your roster, so, and they're all going to play. So in basketball, you have a bench where you have like 13 players or whatever, but half those people are never going to see it.

So, I was telling you the story and I think it's an interesting analog. 2009, the Jets were seven and seven, and they had a win out to make the playoffs as a wildcard team. They're going to play the Colts in the 15th game of 16 games. The Colts were 14 and 0 and had already clinched the division and a bye week and home field advantage. They didn't need to win anymore and they didn't care. Some teams have a pride, they've wanted to go 16 and 0, but the Colts, right? We don't really care. They wanted to protect Peyton Manning, they wanted to protect their team. So they started Curtis Painter, who was a terrible quarterback, and like all their backups against the Jets. And the Jets destroyed them. The Jets starters are way better than the Colts second string. And so suddenly the Jets are",

And that's not fair. And people really complained about that the Jets end up playing the Bengals the next week. The Bengals, this is where things get interesting. And this is not where I told you, but this is an interesting analog. In game 16, the Jets play the Bengals in New York. And it already is seen that the playoff pictures already come into focus.

So the Bengals pretty much lose automatically against the Jets and the Jets make the playoffs. Then the Jets go to Cincinnati and they beat them and the Jets win and go on to the next round. And everyone's like, this all started because the Colts played their second string three weeks ago. And then the Jets played the Bengals. The Bengals didn't want to play their playbook knowing that they were going to play them again the next week. So they lost intentionally, basically.

Teams that didn't make the playoffs because the Jets did were infuriated. The Bengals are infuriated because the schedule put them against them twice in a row, which never happens in the NFL. Of course, that year the Jets went on to win the Super Bowl. They made it to the championship game and lost, but they went far in that year. I was trying to tease him on that, but I had no idea. It was 50-50. I was like, we lost the next game. In the NHL and the NBA, there's a lottery system for the draft. Drafting is very important in sports.

So a team that was really good will get the worst of the best players available. And the team that was the worst will get the best of the best players available in order to create parity. The NBA was looking at this. The 76ers had recently done this several years, for instance. They instituted a lottery saying, if you finish in the last place, you have a 25% chance of getting the first pick. There's no way we can keep doing this over and over again.

And my answer to the Olympics, particular Olympic thing, is that if that's in the guidelines, then you have to play by the rules. And it's also not a team sport with standings and stuff like that. It's really like, well, it's a team sport, but it's a pairs. You have to have a little pride too. And you would never be able to ask a player, even on the 76ers, when they were clearly trying to lose every game. You would never hear them say that they didn't try their hardest. They just sucked.

After the first time, I would have turned to my partner and been like, all right, let's crush them. You know what I mean? We got to do it.

See, this sounds crazy to me. Like it blows my mind that we're actually talking about 16 hours in the air. Cause I was saying earlier, my longest flight I've ever been on seven hours. Oh wow. And that was a fucked up flight to New York where there was like turbulence and issues. So like it was delayed. I don't know. Did we not go? I don't know. I",

It's not bad. I walked the last night. I walked it last night. That is not a target. It's a city target. That is the city target down in fucking Tampa. No,",

This is a, this is no, sorry. I was incorrect. This isn't a city. It's a target express. This is information someone needs to say when they say there's a target down the street. That's a bullshit. It's like, Hey, you want to fucking gimped Walgreens. Here you go. City. I was like, do you have pet food? I'm here for dog. It's like, oh, it's an end cap on an aisle down in front of farm life. Jesus fucking Christ. Yeah. We're getting a real one though. Where we're getting a city target like the one in Metreon at stone stone. Yeah. Yeah. We walked to stone's town.

You know, like cause there's a lot of schools that are in there. So it's a little bit of a scene. The McDonald's is a scene. The fucking food court's a scene. The soup place is a scene. Also all the food court places. If we didn't lose Little Walk, like that would have been a great option. Did they close? No. No. We're all, we're all boycotts. I mean, I've driven by there with, with Aaron several times where they're, they're not even open during the day. Like that place is definitely eating shit. Good. Fuck you.

When we had it, when we needed it and when we needed it, it was there. I had Marty Thai like a week ago. Yeah. Oh yeah. And across the street, there's like two Asian spots. We just, you guys are lazy. You don't want to go to the Chinese food. I've gone to the Chinese food. Awful. Walked in. They're like, hello. Then they sat down and ate their food. I was like, no, come wait on us. What the fuck? Did you get food there? Yeah. You sold us a false bill. So mediocre. West portal is where the truth is. West portal has awesome food.

You're always like, you want to go eat at the great American potato, the food court. I know. That's the problem is I just, I think I was like, oh, they're locals. They know what to do. Every food place you guys really like usually sucks. No, you're wearing a terrible burrito place on your chest right now. Terrible, terrible place on your chest. Right? Gordo is definitely below sub subpar. I got it. I don't need to go to New York. We don't eat burritos in New York. What I'm saying is lowest compadres Los Matatas.

I expect more from you. A Spanish speaker. I mean, we've never gone to my favorite burrito place. Why not? Let's go. Uh, it's far away. So what? How far could it possibly be? Where is it at?
