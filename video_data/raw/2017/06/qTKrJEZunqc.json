It's almost July. This month went faster than I think any month in the history of months. It did. I blame E3. That's just That whole week was a blur. It's just one alcoholic blur. Oh man, what a good E3, though. I keep thinking about it. I had an excellent time this E3. Yeah, excellent time. This This was the first E3 that I'm like, I'm just going to enjoy it. Did we win you over on E3? No, not Well, the social aspect. Yes. Um the the roaming around the show floor looking at games aspect. I could take that or leave that, but really like I I enjoyed doing the live show. That was super fun. Like I enjoyed watching you guys do that. It was awesome having everyone there. You were on for 20 minutes. I was on I did my 20 minutes. Um, that's all anyone can stomach of me talking about video games. About as much as I know. Also,",

It's just what makes it nice is that we chose not to go to VidCon the next week. Yep. You know, it would have been which was last weekend. Um, so it was cool. Had a bit of FOMO about that though. I was getting a lot of tweets from or texts from friends and stuff of pictures of all them hanging out and VidCon stuff. I'm like, sure would have been super fun. Yeah, sure would have fun. But it was also fun not doing that. It was great not doing that. That was actually super fun. I I tweeted out yesterday. I feel really good about stuff. And I do. Last week was freaking awesome.

You got to stop. You got to stop. I'm this close and add more podcasts. So, Schemy Tim Gettys is going to get to the goddamn bot bottom of this. I want kind of funny games daily to be the number one video game podcast definitively. Yeah.

I feel like we need to somehow we just need one thing to hold on to to be like, well, asterisk according to this. And I think iTunes is a very good place. So, I need to figure out exactly what the algorithm is. I have my theories. Yeah, I think that they check every 24 hours and whatever gets the most views every 24 hours is up there, which is why kind of makes sense. Games Daily gets so is high because we release daily. But Greg has a theory and this makes a lot of sense that the amount of reviews and subscriptions also count towards that, right? So we need to really we need everyone's help to push that. Okay.

Uh, but but yeah, I watched a lot of stuff. I did not watch Cars 3. That wasn't the plan, but I'm going to have to wait to watch that uh sometime this week. But I did watch Glow from start. Also started watching Glow. I did. So I one sitting wanted to finish it. Uh, I had some family in town this weekend who had not watched Glow yet and had promised their Glow watching to someone else, which is always I understand that. I've been there. I got a wife. When I promise I'm going to watch them with her, I like to come through on that promise. Got to do it. Um, but she was like I was like, \"Do you want to just start watching?\" Cuz we",

Well, so here's the problem. Like I thought these were 20-minute episodes. They're not. They're like minimum 30 minutes. They're solid 30. Um, but I was like, we only watch three. You could, right? If we started watching right now, we could go. But the problem is when my family comes into town, we all just talk over whatever we're watching. So instead of watching the rest of Glow, I started watching 10 Things I Hate About You again cuz I'm like classic. It's classic. I haven't seen it forever. Still love it. The tweets now make sense from you. Very, very, very interesting movie to go back and watch. I'm like, \"Wow, screenwriters in the '9s really gave high schoolers a lot of credit.\" Like, they gave",

It was like that, Dawson's Creek, anything written by Kevin Smith, all of those you're just like, none of us are this smart. None of us talk like this. But but going back and watching it again, I did get all the uh the references now. Like there was lot cuz my the person that was in town is actually she used to be a teacher. So she's like, \"That's a reference to uh Shakespeare.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, yeah. Okay. So you didn't get the references having someone informed next to you who gave you the references.\" I said, \"I get the references now.\" Okay. I get the reference. Got it. Got it.

It's not great. I'd say it's really good. Not great. Uh I think that it's going to be very overhyped at the end of the day. I think it's a very solid show. I would recommend watching it for sure. It's a lot of fun. The characters are great overall. But my problem is I feel like the show for all of its greatness had too many faults that just they didn't connect right with me.

Like there's They're all living in a hotel. They're pulling. It's pull from a true story. You know what I mean? I get that. My problem, I think, is similar to what you're talking about of like Alison Bree's character I liked. All right. Did you? She's completely unlikable. I like her simply because she's Alison Brie. that I mean that's probably a huge part of it is the fact that she was all right and just the way that like she's not a good person. I think she tries. She doesn't really even try to be towards the She It's It's a weird thing. She doesn't have an arc. I don't like the wolf, Sheila. Not at all. Way too much focus on her. Yeah.",

And there's so many other characters that I wanted them to go deeper on and then they didn't at all. They was like there's certain characters that just show up in like the second half and get a story line that I'm like that story line is either really lazy and weak or it doesn't give me any more of the character that I actually wanted. Exactly. Yeah. 100%. I'm trying to be really native about this. I enjoyed it the entire way through. My thing is I wanted to enjoy it more than I did.

Uh I know, don't me wrong, different quality. Different. Yeah. But uh just the fact that I think when we get around to next time, hopefully we'll double down on all that and get in there. But yeah, I'm with you. I didn't like the the mom who's, you know, the all-American girl or whatever. Li Liberty B. Are you kidding me? She was my favorite part of the show. But I I do think that she also had issues where some of her character growth I'm like this doesn't make sense. No one would act this way.

The pre-sale tickets for Daddy's Home 2 went on sale yesterday. I got us four. We haven't seen his name. I'm sure. I got us four. A problem I have with the show and I was telling Nick this earlier is I feel like it kind of has an identity issue where it's built as a comedy and it's definitely not a comedy but it's also not quite a documentary. It's not kind of a a biopic where it's like going through what actually happened. It's almost that but it never quite dives into either side.

Um I I'll tell you this. I'm really liking Glow. I'm really liking it because I didn't even expect it necessarily to be a comedy. What are you doing? It's just the chat. I'm sorry. What's happening?

I think Mark Maron does a great job in it. You can tell he's improvised some of his lines. you're like he's, you know, obviously really great at that. Um, I'm liking it so far. So, I'll see.

It's not so much she's a funny side character. I wouldn't say there was an episode or two that could get cut, but there was definitely like an episode or two of time that could have got cut overall. Like a bad episode. That's what I mean. I mean, if it were 10 episodes makes good, does six episodes make great? Does eight episodes make great?

Did not know they're doing on all of the on your TV, on your phone. Does it get you ad free experiences on YouTube as well or No, it doesn't. TV and YouTube. Totally separate. Totally separate. Yeah, this is like a PlayStation PlayStation view competitor. Got it. And it's only in certain markets. We're one of the markets. So, I was like, I'll give it a shot. What up, SF?

I only watched it on VHS when uh teachers were gone and substitute teachers would put it in. So I I seen a lot of it, but it was just like random episodes here and there. So again, whatever speed. So long story short, I will It's on HBO right now. I think you can see it on HBO. Yeah, I will go back and watch it at some point this week. You should, man. Go speed.

Uh it's it's still an entertaining show. It's still a very well done show, but they've lost in my opinion the tone and the shenanigans of the first couple seasons where it's not fun anymore. Now it's actually just kind of like stressful. Stressful. It is. It's stressful to see these characters that you love constantly fail. Yeah. And this is a this is a theme throughout all of HBO, by the way.
