I didn't see you there. I didn't know you. I thought I was here in this Moss live. Oh, you thought I was in the world with you. We're in the world. Okay, so this was shown at E3 yesterday. This is one This is one of the uh Sony press conference uh PlayStation VR things. That was one of my predictions from the games cast uh made by a developer named Polyarch uh made up of like a couple X bungee guys. They have some Rockstar talent in there, some Epic talent in there. They have a whole bunch of different things. And uh it was one of the standouts, I think, of the VR segments. People didn't know much about it. They thought it was Mouse Guard at first, but it turned out it's Moss, which is this PlayStation VR game, right, that uh basically starts like this where you're Okay, cool. You're in here.

Bungie Rockstar Epic. That's what I was saying. They have some epic talent. Some rockstar talent. They're They've been working on this game for 2 years. They left the guys who founded it after they left Bungie uh fell in love with VR when they saw Valve working on it. They started working out of a Starbucks were getting their thing off and then they they made two different prototypes for games. Moss being one of them and this is the one they're going with.

X is making her jump as well. So, it is this like they, you know, they called it like an adventure puzzle game or whatever, but it's clearly mixing up the controls, you know, with a video game mixing in the VR headset. Okay, gotcha. So you you were the free camera essentially, right? This is, you know, playable. Obviously, this is the E3 demo and playing it at E3.
