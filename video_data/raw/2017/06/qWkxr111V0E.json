The thing with that is that for those at home watching that probably don't know cuz Kevin did his job right before we went live. He turned the lights off, right? Came right back on and then brought them back on. That's all you need to see. But you guys don't need to know how the magic happens behind the scenes. But spoilers, it's not magic. It's just Kevin actually having a third arm that he uses. We don't ask how the third arm happens. We don't understand who's stimulating to get third arm going. Doesn't matter. Does not matter. Tim, how you feeling on this fun Friday? I am. I'm done. I'm very tired. You look like you came in today. You look bright and bushy like you always do. You always look bright and bush. You did.

I in a perfect world, I would [\u00a0__\u00a0] love nothing more than to sit down with Joey Fetone and just talk to him for an hour. Do you think that somehow we could convince him to join Boy? I think that Well, here's the deal. I need him to join Boy. I need him to mentor us. Oh my god. I need him to be our manager for Boys. You know what I mean? Like I don't think Joey and I are that far away in age, by the way. So he could theoretically join Boys. He's got to be probably like 40 something. I'm almost 74. It doesn't matter.

Mhm. Similar to the more high-profile Ren and Stimpy show, Rockers, Rockos made a name for itself, partially on its ability to seemingly sneak very adultoriented and runchy jokes past the Nickelodeon sensors. This led to a sizable cult fan base for the cartoon, which is now looked back on quite fondly by many.
