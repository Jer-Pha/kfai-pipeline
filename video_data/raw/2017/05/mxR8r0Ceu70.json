So, top level of the Fire Festival, for those that don't know, um, yes, fire is spelled with Hawaii, not an I.

People started showing up and they were promised that the whole event was going to be in in some giant dome. Dome wasn't there. They were told that they each had um glamping tents, right, up to a certain level quality. Instead, they were leftover disaster relief tents. Most of which now big tents, but not glamping. Big tents by any stretch. Most of them not even complete missing walls. Glamping. So, I've glanced before because you know my wife.

Just look up fire festival food. It's the saddest picture you'll ever see. If you type in fire festival into Google and then just look at all the Google images and we can just pull that up.

Yeah, this is the thing I I I I had never heard of fire festival and it was already trending by the time I figured it out.

I remember when we used to drive from the suburbs out to All State Arena, formerly Rosemont Horizon. No, I'm good. Thanks for WWE shows and like that parking lot was always the worst. And so you knew you were about to spend 45 minutes in a parking lot. And so you finally break down and start driving like an [\u00a0__\u00a0] and you have to start cutting people off and doing all this stuff. And like that would start weighing on me as we were finishing a show cuz usually I drove, right? It's like, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm going to have to get out there now and fight.\" Or you got to do the thing where you have to leave hella early. Like my dad pulled at SummerSlam 94. We got to beat traffic. I'm like, \"Dad, it's Undertaker versus Undertaker. Can we just [\u00a0__\u00a0] finish this fight and we got to go?\" Uh yeah, my my wife I caught it on the way out like it was like a crane in my neck as I",

I I would granted this is me saying that never having gone to Alsand, never having gone to Coachella. would love to see what Coachella is like, but I would like to experience it like how I imagine uh Beyonce experiences it where she stays at the mansion, gets flown in by a helicopter, dropped off, performs for a second, and then walks the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out and like gets back on the helicopter and goes.

So they have their own like private building on the island. One of the only buildings on the island is theirs. They're there chilling, having a good time.
