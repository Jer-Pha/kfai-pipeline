    "description": "Big Boss is back.\n\nABOUT SPOILERS: Hey! It's me, Greg. I've played 60 hours of MGSV. (Only 2 when I made this Let's Play.) Nothing in these early let's plays will spoil the story. Yes, you will now know how missions begin and story elements, but the fun in MGSV is tackling these situations how you want to. Plus, the story elements you'll see here have been in trailers. I love the Metal gear franchise, and I wouldn't ruin it for you. Also, I know you're better than I am at MGS, so don't bother saying it in the comments. ;)\n\nSubscribe! https://www.youtube.com/user/kindafunnygames?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCome discuss MGS V on our forum: http://kindafunnyforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=3799\n\nThis video was edited on an ORIGIN PC EVO15-S Laptop. Get your PC here: http://www.ORIGINPC.com\n\nEach and every day, Tim Gettys, Greg Miller, and Colin Moriarty get together to talk videogames. \n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nColin - http://www.twitter.com/NoTaxation\n\nMusic by Rakohus!: http://www.youtube.com/user/rakohus",
