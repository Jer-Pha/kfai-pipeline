Jennifer got here early and Jennifer had a panic attack because she got here and she's like, is it going to get worse? And I said, what do you mean? And she met the crowd of people because if you're watching it on the video over there, you don't understand that Geek and Sundry didn't really understand how popular we were.

What are we doing with everybody? And then over here, Jennifer though was like, is it going to get worse? Because it was like 2.20, 2.30. I'm like, yeah, it's going to get worse before three. And she's like, I can't go home and finish my cosplay or change into my cosplay, but I'm going to stick it out because I love Philip DeFranco. Oh, I know. She had no idea she was talking to me.

Phil, what number of Comic Con is this for you? Fifth. What's your favorite part? What brings you back to Comic Con other than the paycheck? The paycheck. I'm here for free. I think it's literally just strolling the floor because I'm a huge fan of cosplay in general and then just meeting people that watch us. Yeah. Yeah, that's it really.

No, I mean, it's, you know, we spend 90% of our life either around your kitchen table or in your spare bedroom and sometimes you forget that there's actually people on the other side of the camera that listen and watch everything you say.

Here's my question before we pass it off to Tim. Sorry, I wasn't enough on the draw on that one. My question for you, Nick, is have you gotten used to it yet? No. Phil DeFranco and I, huge stars. We've been that way for years. Everyone on the internet understands who we are. We can't even go to Whole Foods without somebody. Oh, you want a rotisserie? Wait, you're Phil DeFranco. Just give me my organic chicken. Yeah, no, right, exactly. No, I always tell the story of that one E3 when someone tapped me on the shoulder.

But today I was wearing my badge and for the, you know, it's happened before, but someone came up and said, oh my God, you're Nick Scarpino. And he immediately gave me a hug and I was like, you didn't even have to look at my badge. That's fantastic. So no, it'll never, I'll never get used to it. This is awesome. And it's, it's like I said yesterday, we walked into the meet and greet and thanks so much everyone for that came to the meet and greet. Awesome. It was really cool.

Pee. I poop once a day, regular. I just admitted that to a lot of people. It's chronicled on Colin and Greg live each and every morning. So I don't think it's like an admission really. My favorite thing at Comic-Con besides obviously seeing you guys and all that stuff, it's the announcements and which is I think the weirdest thing of being here because then you don't get to hear the announcements.

He's the muscle. No, he's more like the slightly slow younger brother. But they're really big and lumbering and they eat people, but they don't really know why. Do you watch this? Do you watch this anime? Not at all. Me neither. There's a live action trailer now, right? For the movie. But Greg, the important thing to note is that they have no genitalia.

Ty Root would be a great one. Or Craig Baradon. That would have to be it. But then they're actually gonna be muscly. Yeah, that's the whole point. You quit Team Fat so long ago.

Well, I hit that level and then we went to the outcast party and then no one was there, which was great because that means the line to like a little buffet was like non-existent. So I ate like 14 little hot dogs, which were interesting because they were like half hot dog. They weren't little weenies. They were half hot dog, which is strange.

And it was interesting to see Greg, he looked like he was like this. He looked like he was roped down. And it's like, then when I played it, I was like, oh, that's why you look so stupid. I get it. Again, you can't play VR games. It looked good. But Nick did. He made it look real good. So here's my question. You're a father now. You're an adult. We're overgrown man children.

Because when he was like a little blob, I could do like that daddy holding thing and I would just like play while he was just sleeping on me. And I was like, this is the dream. I'm doing the dad stuff. And the me stuff. Fatherhood's not that hard. Yeah. I mean, the thing that I'm worried about is my wife and I disagree on how, like, if he's going to play games.

Yeah. He was like, no, you're not. That's the hardest part about any of this though is when you have that giant, giant look back this way, way back machine that Chronicles your evolution as a person and you go back like, why was I wearing those pants? Why would anyone wear pants like that? Yeah. The first two years, like I talked",

The Jessica Alba one? Good luck Chuck. God, that was a piece of garbage. Wow. I feel like, Oh, I love that movie. You just love Jessica Alba? I love that movie. I'll watch that forever.

Do you guys have any advice? How far are you from down here? Yeah, I'm from Orange County. I'm from Placencia. Placencia, okay. And you're going to the Humboldt? Yeah. Awesome. Here's the deal. College to me, I grew up in Riverside. You know these areas. I grew up in Riverside and I went to UC Irvine.

We're not going to go into that. But I think that college is meant to take you out of your comfort zone. And I think the fact that you're going so far away is going to be an awesome experience for you because you're going to be on your own, man. And guess what? The rest of your life, you're going to be on your own. So you better start figuring it out right now and figuring out how to succeed in it and have fun, man. It's going to be a blast. Just be safe.
