Oh you're like the carrot top of it. So listen, even though I've lived here for 20 years and my accent is a bit of a, it's all gone weird, people think I'm Australian. Oh mate, do I make you feel at home, governor? No, you don't. I'm originally from England and as you know, I'm a big fan of your Oreo. Oreo-ation. Oreo-ation. I'm kind of funny. Is that the right way to pronounce it? Oreo, do you just go Oreo Oreo-ation? Oreo Oreation. There's a hard start there. Oreo Oration. Yeah. Okay, do you still do that? Yes. Have you looked at the new Red Velvet ones? I have. So what's typically the time difference between a new Oreo coming out and you being on the case? When the big ones are coming up, like Red Velvet. Do you have a system in place for like knowing ahead of time when you want to come? I have contacts, I have contacts. I may or may",

Chances are I already got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If something's not reviewed it's just being excluded right now. Because what happened recently that changed my perception of everything, Red Velvet obviously but before that was the Marshmallow Krispie and the Reese's Peanut Butter one. Right, right. When those came out, those were like events. Like that one I was ready for, I got them early, Oreo sent them to me so I could have my reviews prepped and primed for the embargoes or whatnot.

Berry is a great everyday Oreo. It's a great, it's like that's like your standby, that's what you have on tap ready to go. I love the Marshmallow Krispie as well, I love as you know I had my first Oreogasm with the white, the golden Birthday Cake Oreo. But those are like. I think the Birthday Cake one's too sweet. Exactly, that was what I was talking about. I had the Oreogasm, I went bwah and I lost my mind but you couldn't eat that every day. You have a few of those and you put them away, you stop.

Sure, sure, sure, sure, I agree with that. But this is all my roundabout way of saying that as an English person, American chocolate is shit. Damn! So wait, are you taking a shot at Oreos still or are you saying? Yes, Oreos as cookies, in the great pantheon of cookies. You get the fuck out of here. If there was like a global ranking of cookies, Oreos would basically be the sawdust at the bottom that the ranking table was put on. You clearly never had a Chips Ahoy my friend. What?

My country of birth. And you could do your own little oration right now on some different varieties. And I have enough for everyone. So do you have viewers in the UK? Yes we do. Oi! I'll translate for you. Oi there governor, sure got some biscuits for you with your porridge. I'm sure they must be loving that. Nailed it. They really do. I single that and you drove kesmcdonald.ign with that. So I brought some things for you to try. And some of them are my favorites and things that I grew up on. Oh great, okay.

Actually if you're gonna pee, I'll pee. Alright, let's take a pee break. Like you know, collaboratively. We can be together, it's fine. At the same time. We're gonna collaborate. So we'll come back. And we'll try these cookies. And we'll do the biscuits. Biscuits. Okay, alright. Alright, we're done peeing. We're back. We're back. Let's start eating biscuits. Right, so as I said, Oreos, good in like a FEMA emergency ration type of drink. You eat them! You talked about this! I'll be the first to admit that I eat a lot of shit, a lot of garbage.

This is coming from Gary Witte, who after up at noon, our former roommate Mike met Gary Witte and was blown away to meet Gary Witte in line at a KFC Taco Bell. Oh that's right!

So now, I don't watch the show so I don't know. This show? No no no, don't worry. Of course I watch this show. I don't watch Doctor Who. But apparently Doctor Who recently made these kind of popular because one of the recent doctors liked to snack on these because it's a very English thing. They've been around for decades.

Yeah, that looks like a big ass motherfucker. Oh okay, I see, I see. Alright, thank you for the Jammy Dodger. Is everyone gonna partake here? Oh yes. Alright, okay. There's a Jammy Dodger for you.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm thinking of. This is chewier than that. Let's try something else. Okay, so. Pirouettes, the Pepperidge Farms. This is another staple. This is a classic. This is the Cadbury's chocolate digestive. Okay. My wife loves that. Now. That has a horrible name. The other one had such a great name. So, we don't name foods very well. I'll give you that.

Greg, how's that one sitting with you? These are delicious. Thank you. I'm a big fan of chocolate covered graham crackers. I like that this is softer than your normal graham cracker. It's not quite a graham cracker. Exactly. It's softer than your graham cracker anymore. It's the closest analog that I have for it. It tastes more like a cracker. It's a little savory.

It's got too much of a rye. It tastes like cracker. These are not as well known. I grew up on these and most English people do know these are called Viscount biscuits. Which is very English. You are really bad at naming food. Lions biscuits Viscount. They all sound like pharmaceuticals. Something you would buy to keep from brain hemorrhaging.

There's fewer cookies so that's like two thin mints in one but you get fewer of them in the back. It feels lighter so you can eat more of them. I actually prefer this. Is Greg going back for seconds on this? No, no, no. I'll just make sure I give it a... Because I'm trying to make, you know.

And the reason why I brought these up now, these has all been done in a very specially curated order. You liked the chocolate digestive. What happened was several years ago in England, as a society, we basically said the chocolate Cadbury's chocolate digestive is fantastic, but how can we do better? Like, are we satisfied? Sure. Can we go to the next level? So it's like the double stuff for all. And we all, you know, the same way that we all got together to defeat Hitler in world war II. And you know, we got through the great recession and we do all that stuff. We pulled through and we came up, we did what was basically thought of as the impossible. Create a biscuit that is like a chocolate digestive and yet superior to it. And it was done and it's called the hobnob. So",

And it was done and it's called the hobnob. So this is the McVitie's hobnobs. Now these originally, so the original digestive didn't have the chocolate on top. It was just the Graham crack apart. Sure. And then we added the chocolate. Same with the hobnob originally was just the crack apart, the biscuit part. And then we added, it was just the hob. And then the knob came later. Now, so just to kind of prime me on this, this is like a chocolate digestive, but instead of the Graham cracker, it's more of a OT oatmeal kind of OT biscuit, but really, but more, I think more substantial. And I don't know if this is a thing over here, but if you like to dunk, do you like to dunk your biscuits into your tea or your coffee?

I feel bad for the jolly Dodger. They're all chocolate. Don't feel bad. That's okay. These also remind me of those new bars, the granola bars that are like the hard ones. They get the crack off a little bit. It's got a little of that flavor. Okay. So, uh, one more before we get into the final round. Uh oh. There is a bonus round. Oh wow. Okay. Now, I'll say this.

You may have in fact had these because they are popular around the world and actually have spawned a brand of very popular imitators in the United States, but there's only one original and it's known as the Jaffa Cake. Another McVitie's. McVitie's original Jaffa Cake. McVitie's pretty much owned this market. Of what? Weird ass cookies? I guarantee you right now, I was always doing that very long little intro there.

Okay. So between the Jammy Dodgers and the, I would say the Viscounts are kind of more of a fringe thing, but Jammy Dodgers, the digestives, the Hobnobs and particularly the Jaffa cakes are kind of like the staples of English biscuit biscuit based snacking. So now you've, now you've experienced them all. I think like on a date, like I'm talking about everyday Oreos, Hobnobs would be an everyday cookie. Okay. Jaffa cakes would be Jaffa. Special occasion.

No but that makes more sense because it's a different taste than a cookie. You're making us understand your people. It's like I said. These are the ways of my people. There's a lot more complexity to these cookies than I would have originally imagined. With American cookies it's literally how much sugar can we cram in one small square inch.
