Colin? >> Yes. >> You made a prediction on the kind of funny games caps\n>> Yes. >> That Fallout 4 is coming this year. >> Yeah.\n>> It's getting announced this year. It's getting released this year. >> Yep.\n>> Today. Bethesda announces they're doing an E3\npress conference, June 14th, that's all they said, it's in\nHollywood. How do you feel about your prediction\nright now? >> Oh, it's, it's, the, the announcement\npart anyway is a lock at this point. >> Yeah, yeah, yeah. >> The bigger question is not about\nFallout 4, because I think it's obvious. I think that what the bigger question is,\nis is when will Fallout 4 come out? I still think it will come out this year. Why do you think that? Because I don't think that, this is one of\nthose few, let me back up. We talk about a game like Half Life 3\nright? Our good friend Charles used to say",

He would say that valve could release the\ngame and not say anything about it and put it up, and that would be one of the\nfew games that would be fine. People would freak, freak the fuck out. >> Yeah.\n>> Like, they're like, the game's done and here it is. >> Yeah yeah yeah. >> You know? And I kind of feel like Bethesda with\nFallout 4 is one of those studios and one of those games where they you do\nsomething not, maybe not, as, as similar but like,\nFallout 4 is real, we'll have one event where people play it\nand see it and that's it. >> Yeah.\n>> Because that game's going to have so much hype, and it has so much hype for not\neven being announced yet. >> Sure. >> And will sell. Exorbitant, eight, nine, ten, 12 million\ncopies probably at least. >> Yeah.",

In fact, it would hurt them to announce\nthe game and stretch it out over an 18 month period. >> Sure.\n>> Because then people will start picking it apart. >> Right, right, right, right, right. >> So I think that Fallout 4 being\nannounced at this thing is, is obvious. I think the bigger question is. What is Machine Games doing? What is, is Tango gonna make Evil Within\nagain? What is id doing? >> You're talking about the rest of\nBethesda's calendar. >> Right, exactly.\n>> This isn't we're doing an event, a 15 minute presentation. >> Right.\n>> This is that we're doing our own press conference, which means, as you know, from\nSony, Microsoft, and Nintendo and. We have a lot to say. >> Right.\n>> We're not talking about one game. We're talking about many games. >> Right.\nI mean, you would assume that, right? >> Yeah.",

Maybe that's possible. >> Yeah.\n>> But. I don't, again, I don't think that's, I\ndon't think that''s gonna happen. What is Arkane doing? It seems liked they're working on\nDishonored 2, [COUGH] I mean, that, that's been the\nrumor for, rumored for a long time. Maybe we see Dishonored 2. >> What is Doom? >> Id has been working on Doom 4 for a long time,\n>> Yeah. >> and so maybe you see that there. Everyone forgets that Bethesda owns a\nbunch of studios,\n>> Yeah. >> you know, eh, like they have.

So, you know, what, you know, are they\ngonna announce an Evil Within sequel? I'm sure I won't be ready for years, but Evil Within sold much better\nthan I think people thought- >> Sure.\n>> It was gonna be. It, it, it was much better a game. So, are they gonna, you know, have an\nassociation with my comedy and do a sequel to that? >> Yeah. >> What's going on with Prey 2? Prey 2 was anarchy and it was canceled. I was at an event years ago with Nick\nScarpino where we saw Prey 2 being played. The game was, there was at least a chunk\nof the game done. >> Right.\n>> It looked very cool.

Too early to hear something about a new\nWolfenstein? And then what about something from Elder\nScrolls? Do they focus more on like an expansion\nfor the MMO? Do they mention they're going to do\nsomething, you know, on it's own with an RPG, Skyrim 2,\nwhatever? >> So Machine Games, [UNKNOWN] owns\nMachine Games. Machine Games has only made one game,\nWolfenstein: The New Order. They're definitely going to make a sequel\nto that. You have to assume that the engine's done. That game, again better than people\nthought it was going to be again did better than people thought it\nwas going to do. That game was actually a fan a a darling\nfor some people last year.>>Sure.

But certainly there gonna make another. Do you think, all of the things we are\ntalking about is, Of course they are going to make a game,\nmaybe it's not ready. Do you think they go the EA route from E3\nlast year? Do a bunch of videttes of like, this is\nwhat the Mass Effect team is working on. There's not an announcement, the game is\nnot done, there's is nothing to show you.>> I hope they don't do that\nbecause that was stupid. Because that like got people.

In August, in June, Fallout 4 is here. It takes place in Massachusetts, which it\nprobably does. The, the, you know, this is the logo. Here's a little bit of game play. In August, they're like, we have press,\nand we're gonna play it for a few hours. And then in November. November, here's the game. You know.\n>> Would be awesome. >> Because remember, Skyrim came out a\nlong time ago, and Skyrim was a Todd Howard game,\nobviously New Vegas was made by Obsidian, so that brings up an interesting question,",

I think that it's possible that Elder\nSchools six, or a significant expansion or side story might be under development at\nanother studio. Kind of similar to what Obsidian did with\nNew Vegas. So, I don't think it's [UNKNOWN], I think\ntheir hands are pretty full right now. But I think that would be an exciting you\nknow premise too. Because again we're not gonna get Elder\nScrolls six or a Skyrim style Elder Scrolls game for a\nvery long time.>>Mm hm.>>Considering how long these guys put into\nFallout.>>Sure.>>So, I think this is really exciting, because\nthis is a awesome publisher.

And again they, you know, Machine Games\nobviously has ten year olds and, and other shooter studios has a lot of\ntalent there for most studios too. Arcade obviously speaks for itself. They opened a new Arcade studio. So I don't know, this is exciting. And I don't think it's going to be all\nabout Fallout. I think Fallout is going to be the last\ngame they talk about. >> Yah, it'll be the best game they talk\nabout. >> So, so concrete predictions. Dishonor 2. >> Yah. >> For sure, I think Dishonor 2 is going\nto be there. >> Lock of the week. >> I think obviously, yah we'll see\nFallout 4. And then I think, you know, you'll see",

But [UNKNOWN]. So I think those are, there's good reason\nto be excited about those other games. >> Well, ladies and gentlemen, are you\nexcited about this year Bethesda E3 event?
