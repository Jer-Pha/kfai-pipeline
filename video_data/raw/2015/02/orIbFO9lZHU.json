Um we need an Xbox fanboy cuz apparently I'm the Nintendo fanboy. You guys are the Sony fanboys. We need Nick can be the Xbox fanboy. Yeah, sure. Learn everything about Gears of War. Done.

Um so, he's talking about trailers and he wants to know how much trailers can make or break a game. They can [\u00a0__\u00a0] they can dominate. I mean, look at Dead Island. Dead Island, remember, it's hard now that there's been so many Dead Islands or up to Dead Island 2, which sounds like there hasn't been that many, but then you realize there was a bunch of [\u00a0__\u00a0] spin-offs and other PC things and another episodic deal.

This the backwards the backwards one slow motion uh the piano playing over in cut with the child being chased and everything else. Like when that came out that was an IG exclusive. Ryan Gettis had gotten that from Deep Silver and it like it exploded like and I remember when they showed us the rough cut of it. They're like, \"Oh, we're negotiating this exclusive. Here's what we have so far.\" And we all watched like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] if this comes together. I mean, it's already fantastic and there's drawings for parts of it.

Like, this is not the serious game.\" But by that point, nobody cared. That thing jumparted the franchise and made people aware of it. You know what I mean? Where it spread out. And this always goes I always go back to this with the review discussion of Eric at from EDR at the time when he did it at GDC and said it's just about people knowing your game exists in reading a review. It doesn't matter if it was good or bad. People need to know there needs to be that cache. This is the same thing, right? Like if you put your trailer out there and you make an impact, you're great.

Um, but so many people watched it and that's the type trailers are important because they don't need gameplay. Like it it can just kind of give you an idea of what the game is supposed to be like and uh I feel like a lot of people even non-gamers can kind of relate to that and latch on to it and share with their friends and all that stuff and build that buzz about this game. So yeah, Dead Island was a thing before it was a game. Right. Right. Right. Right. That's very very very important. Same thing when like you know I yelled out, you know, we need an Xbox fanboy. I yelled out about Gears of War. You remember the Mad World",

Same thing with Halo. Like, and I think that's the the movie trailer experience. When you get a game playing footage before a movie, that's the general populace that is seeing this thing. And those those theater trailers always feel different. They always feel way more cinematic and way more like you're you're appealing to a different audience, right? Like, you know, like Colin and I always joke around when we about our favorite PlayStation trailers that come out of Japan, right? and they're like, \"Now with PlayStation Platinum trophy support and like all the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Colin and I nerd out about, but nobody in a movie",

It was Samus Walking. It was a [\u00a0__\u00a0] badass trailer. It's like great. That game was not that. But yeah, man, I remember that being super awesome. Halo 2, the the first trailers for that were just insane. Halo 3. Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] The Halo 3 trailer was insane with Master Chief just walking like super long and Cortana just giving the speech. Yeah, man.

I think that that Gears of War trailer of Mad World is was effective and was awesome and it was important because um we have to remember that the the context of Gears of War coming out very early in Xbox 360's life cycle. And Xbox 360 was fine, but Xbox was a failure compared to to PS2. And it was important for them to come out and shake things up a little bit, be a little more adult, aim at a different kind of audience. And I think they captured with Gears of War. That trailer was, I think, not only my favorite trailer, you know, in my opinion, but but maybe one of the most, if not the most important trailer, um, that I've ever seen for a game. So, it just in terms of its artistic value, uh, the revival, the the with the combined with Donnie Darko, the complete revival of",

It was funny as hell to watch it because I was I've always been into Tears for Fears and watching people just suddenly love Tears for Fears again was like so weird. And it was because of Donnie Darko in that [\u00a0__\u00a0] trailer. Um, and uh, I think it was important because that really gears along Halo was already out and people enjoyed Halo, Halo 1 and 2 on Xbox, but Gears was that first nextG exclusive for them. And so, um, that was an important trailer, but what I'm what I'm what I'm more into is like I don't watch many trailers, even for games I'm interested in, unless I'm like really really interested in the game. I don't actually ever watch footage of the game cuz I kind of don't want to. I I consume things with more of the written word and",

I I consume things with more of the written word and screenshots and stuff like that or art and then not try to spoil it too too much for myself. What's funny about that is that that's the way we always did it before. Like it's so funny like we're getting old. We are like like even in the PS2 and Gamecube and Xbox eras. We really weren't getting this hodgepodge of [\u00a0__\u00a0] trailers. It really didn't start until Xbox 360. Um and so I still kind of consume things in the old way. Um but you know some trailer I I really like the Resistance 3 trailer. I never forget that Resistance 3 trailer. The first one when they're on the train it was all live action whatever the horns were playing and stuff like that. like the air air sirens, they get you excited.

That was a that was a a seminal trailer, expertly done trailer, and that game was not the trailer, you know? And that's like and that's why you you know you got to be a little over I mean like and this is for the I think maybe the first time for the first time on Games Cast ever where I've brought up DC Universe in a serious sense and not just a joke like the blur trailer they did for DC Universe online remember blur get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out how [\u00a0__\u00a0] incredible that was and that all of a sudden everyone wanted to know about DC Universe online and then they went and saw it and they were like I'm good like that's you know what I mean like I loved it and",

And I was I told the story of like, you know, my mainstream friend who doesn't play games and has a life and has a job that isn't connected to this industry texted me when he saw the original order trailer. He's like, \"That's that's the one, man. That's what I'm excited for.\" And he's like, \"That's awesome, but like we don't know anything based on that.\" So that's why like when Colin initially wrote like, \"Hey, I saw this for the first time and it didn't look good.\" People ripped them apart, right? Because for 6, nine months, they've been sitting there going, \"This is it. AAA PlayStation 4 experience can't [\u00a0__\u00a0] wait.\" And somebody's like,",

Nobody understands exactly what's happening. You know what I mean? In ter I'm talking about like right now, like at the very very moment we're recording this is people are so hung up on this one thing cuz that's all you can talk about. And that is so devastating to hear a game you've been waiting years for is going to take you half a day. Well, and and the funny thing about that, we're talking about that first trailer, that E3 2013 trailer of The Order, which is an awesome trailer. Spoiler. I'm going to give you a chance to turn it off. It's not really a spoiler. It's not really a spoiler at all, but I'm going to just mute a chance. Just mute it for a few seconds.

Okay, that scene isn't anywhere in the game. I don't know if you noticed that. Like what they showed what they showed in that trailer, nowhere in the game. Yeah. So, like what I'm as far as I can tell, I don't remember ever seeing them in a carriage, getting out of the carriage with their guns out with all the like that never happens. So, that just goes to show you again why you cannot trust trailers. But see, I I'm on a completely opposite side of you when it comes to trailers. Like, I love watching trailers and I think that it's such an important part of the whole experience of the game. And I prefer it when things like that happen, when it's like it doesn't ruin the game. It doesn't ruin the game. Here's here's something that feels like the game. Like I remember the Prince of Persia, the the second and third",

A lot of the story elements that they showed, that's not how the story went. And I I enjoyed that cuz it's like, oh, this trailer looks cool and it intrigues me, but then I'm getting a completely different experience. It's like when you watch a movie and it's like great, unless it's a Fast and Furious movie. This trailer just ruined everything cuz nothing can ruin Fast and Furious movie. Um, but yeah, with the games, like I enjoy that. Like that to me that sounds great that that is not in the game. To me, it's disappointing because I was actually waiting for that same like that was an awesome scene. like where where when when are they and there's a scene when they're in a carriage and I'm like oh it's going to happen",

To me it's I always find that weird because we're getting excited about a world but not getting excited about what we're going to get. And I think that sometimes in movies you see like deleted clips that don't end up in the movie, but they're made and made to be in the movie. They don't No one's making movie trailers or very often making movie trailers where nothing is in the [\u00a0__\u00a0] movie. You know what I mean? It's like that's just weird. That's a weird precedent I think to set just for games where it's like well it's not in the game. Um, and that's good. I'm like I don't know. I mean, I got I got excited seeing the order because I was like, \"Oh, this looks dark as hell.\" And I actually don't",

So, like I think it's a I don't want to say it's deceptive in that sense, but cuz maybe that was in the game. Maybe they cut it, but it's just I want that's why I don't get too hyped about trailers. I get hyped about gameplay and I watch gameplay and that's why it was cool when we saw Uncharted 4 at PSX. It's like, okay, this is the game and now you know that this is in the game and this is at least the way the game is going to look. Yeah. And I think that that is much more valuable than the the marketing hype that is that is the trailer that is just designing. Like you have to be confident enough to show your game. Sure.

Like, there's posters everywhere, all that stuff. And it's like, yeah, you know, money goes a long way when it comes to that stuff, and GTA has money, but it's like, why does GTA have money?

That's because internet video didn't exist back then.

Um, but like that was crazy to me that like that was the turning point because it went from I can only read about these things and see images which is a whole different type of marketing to now oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] I get a video and from then on it was like every single time something happened I needed to see the video of it.

But it really sold because of the precedent that they set. There was a lot of thought put into everything they did, you know, and like and that that was we didn't expect it. We kept waiting for them to [\u00a0__\u00a0] it up and they never did. They never [\u00a0__\u00a0] it up and they still haven't. And that's like the most extraordinary extraordinary thing which is why PS4 is around 20 million units sold. You know, more than twice as many PS4s have been sold in Wii U with a year less on the market. PS4 is only 4 million units behind GameCube. You know what I mean?

They do anything. They didn't put up commercials. Do you know what I mean? And so yeah, they had they weren't speaking to their audience. And then when they went to PlayStation 4 and they said, \"Okay, we're about the gamers for the gamers. Developers bring your thing.\" Da da da. That was a huge turning point them in terms of that. But then still now for as far as front-facing, consumerf facing, mainstream facing, that's where they still struggle.

I think that they're do I think it's brilliant because the old Sony would have had the order 1886 ads all over the goddamn place, but they don't. And they have like a commercial, you know?

That would be that would be 1/4 of the PlayStation 4, but they're hungry, you know. But nonetheless, I think that Sony is the undisputed master of marketing right now because they're playing the long game. It's not about like the final trailer. It's not about the launch trailer.
