Um, that doesn't sound like a real name. Are you guys done? I apologize. Cross talking. I apologize. You get caught up in the cross talking. Uh, anyway, uh, he sent us he sent I don't know if you guys saw this or he tweeted at you guys, but he sent us analytics for the game over show. Oh, I saw that. I did see that. Uh, my topics are the least popular. And what? And uh, let's wait, hold on. What does it say? I love cruel internet comments that are meant to be helpful. Like, your hair looks really bad lately.

Um and we were saying on the show, no matter the context of it, the context in the game, by the way, if people haven't seen it, is that it's a movie being shot and they're actors. But regardless, like it's that's the topic. And in Australia, they're not going to let the game be released. They were not even going to give it a rating.

Um or if do you think that like anything goes and I guess I was read I was watching a Bill Maher thing today and I don't agree with Bill Maher on a lot of things. I mean, I'm on the different side of the political spectrum from I think on many in many ways, but um I do agree with him when he was saying like the people are so upset about the things people say. Like a lot a lot of freedom of speech is curtailed when people are their feelings are hurt basically. It's like not even offensive, it's just like I don't want you to say this or I don't want you to say that because it hurts my feelings or I'm sensitive",

I mean, I I go to art galleries and see like, oh, that's really crazy. That's her pubic hair. Like, you know, really weird. I want to go to those art galleries. Exactly. You do not want to see.

So if if we don't go into a uncomfortable area then we never grow or at least get the opportunity to think uh differently whether we do or not. It's better to be exposed and choose for yourself, right? But now it's almost like we're coming on two different things, right?

Yeah. Um which doesn't happen all the time, right? Of course. I mean, not like other people I know, but yeah, it it has happened many times. Of course, like that to me isn't a freedom of speech issue because that's a direct threat. That's a threat like as opposed the difference is like saying like um I'm going to kill you, right? That's a threat or I'm going to make a piece of art about killing someone. Yeah, those are two different things. Yeah, like you know what I mean?

It's that's that's the weird part of the the current culture that's very bizarre to me. We always talk about it on this show and you know a million other times the vocal minority that steps up and talks about this. So so many people enjoy all of our content, enjoy it and bounce.

There's nothing in other words if there's nothing actionable about the threat. Bill Maher brought up another thing about Holocaust denial in Europe. That's that's illegal in most European countries, a legacy of obviously post 1945 Europe and how ashamed especially a lot of Germans and Austrians were about what happened.
