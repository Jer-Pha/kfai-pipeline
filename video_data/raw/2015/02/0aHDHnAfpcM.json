This is the illustrious Nick Scarpino. >> Hello.\n>> We are back here for a teaching Tuesday right here on Kinda\nFunny Games. Nick, we've been trying to blaze our way\nthrough Mega Man 2 one of those great NES games from back in the day and we've been\nbeating it stage by stage by stage. >> No, I don't have a good memory, but I'm trying to figure out which, why would\nthey design characters that are just all. That's because you beat me 7, this\nparticular gentleman here.>>Okay, I see.>>So we started with I think we beat\nbubble man, flash man, and metal man early on. Then we went through guys like wood man,\nquick man, then crash man. And Tim and I just went through air man\nand now we are going to go through heat man. You only have one option left, heat man. Who is the robotic Zippo lighter. So go head and select him. >> So Real quick before we get into that. Wood man was my favorite.Heat man is",

He looks a little cross eyed. >> He looks bonkers. >> Well and, and what, what, so select\nplus. Select him and I like how he's just, he's\nlighter. >> Oh, he is literally of the lighter. >> Yep.\n>> Great. I'm coming at you Heatman. I'm at your heart.\n>> Now, now we, we've had the weapon for a while that we need to debe, defeat\nHeatman, which is the bubble lead. But we needed item two from Airman before\nwe really dealt with him. Now we have it and so we can ,. We can continue on our way. The stage is, is somewhat difficult but\nit's kind of metered too. There's just well, first of all, you might want to press start and metal oh\n>> Shit. >> You just jumped right in. >> Yeah, you got me, you got me, you got\nme wound up. >> That's alright.\n>> Should I press start and get the metal blades out? >> Press start and get the metal blades",

It's not necessarily easier I don't think, like I don't, like, it is what it is, kind\nof. Like with this one it's actually not\neasier at all, just jump over it.
