I've been waiting for that and we've been hearing about this stuff and now we finally get some ideas of details. What do you guys think?

They didn't want the kind of more alakart uh at least a lot of people didn't want the more alakart kind of approach to it where you rent games. I mean, I I did a piece on IGN some time ago where I was comparing the rental prices and how ridiculous they were in terms of you can rent the game for a few hours. You can rent the game for a day, seven days, like just give people a subscription and give them like what they, you know, as much as they want. Um, seems like they have some pretty good publishers on board Nco Bandai and Sega and obviously their first party stuff. So, and others. Um, so I think it's a nice start, but I don't think it's quite the revolution that, you know, we might have thought it was when when now when it first got announced.

When when they announced they bought Guy Kai, it was super exciting and crazy and what are they going to do with it and now it's just like now it's just a feature.

I want like it needs to be especially if I own these games already. Like there can't be a worse version of what I already played before, you know? Yeah. I think the the major problem is that you're never going to be able to with something just inherently technologically nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, right?

The fact is that the latency cannot be removed completely like it's not possible. Yeah. You know, so like the what what what I think would be really interesting and I'm not I'm not I've talked to people about this from beyond you know beyond before some people you know engineers out there and stuff understand this better. But what seems to be the solution to this problem like engineers Yeah. like engineer, you know, they're they're hanging out with their little hat and they're like, \"Wait a second.

So say you're like streaming Bioshock, it would stream the area around you or some some sort of like I'm you know again you know some people engineers out there probably like tearing their hair out but like some sort of algorithm or whatever where it tells you like the surrounding areas are loaded and you're basically playing the game on your unit and the data is constantly being shuffled in so that there is no latency.

I mean there Sony's finally starting to understand that they have to kind of creep out of their ecosystem that you know this will obviously be on phone like you know experience Sony phones and stuff like that in addition to VA and PS4 but they're going to go to non Sony devices and that's the really interesting thing too and one of the things they confirmed was the cloud obviously and and rightfully so I think and logically is going to save your save and you can cross save like you do between PS4 and VA but between any of these units and I think that that's really exciting it's just it has to work and I",

In the one of the very very long stretches before Last of Us, they came out and talked about PlayStation mobile and they were like, \"This is what we're doing. We're getting our games on these devices.\" And I said definitively, I'm like, \"That was the most important announcement of that conference because it showed Sony future proofing saying, \"We're going to be on everything. We're going to do this.\" And they closed down Sony Mobile in the last PlayStation mobile. It's almost like they they did this and then the PlayStation 4 sells gang busters.

Having PlayStation Now and Guy Kai ready to go when you launched the system and had no real, you know, not no games, but not as many, you know what I mean? That would have been the time to get hooks in everybody, have them go in. It was kind of like the Wii when it first launched, like just having when it launched with actual virtual console games. Like I feel like a lot of people were more into that. I bought so much stuff. You play Wii Sports for like 10 minutes and then you're like, \"Oh, cool. Mario 1 again, right? Donkey Kong.\" Yeah.

I mean, some of the games that people have to understand that like, yeah, it would be nice to get Crash Bandicoot and Crash Bandicoot is available, but Sony didn't publish Crash Bandicoot. You know what I mean? like like technically a defunct publisher released released Crash Bandic and Activision I guess now owns those old you know those those Universal games or whatever but but there's just a lot these are the same issues they ran into with PlayStation Allstars where it's like well we aren't square we can't force them to let us have cloud in PlayStation Allstars I know you want us to do and it's the same thing when they",

EA's already shown that they're going to do that. So, um with their own EA, you know, pay, you know, kind of alart service. So, um PS now is exciting. Uh I think they lost their window.

Like when you look at the this changes everything when you look at the virtual console on Nintendo it's one of those things where it's like you need to wait years for the games that you want to come out for the system and then sometimes they just won't like how long it take Earthbound to come out.

But it wasn't like, you know, if they put a giant patch out for Red Dead, nobody would care. But the major the major difference too because you guys were talking about Titanfall and and how that game resonated with people quickly but then was forgotten really is because it's not only because it was only on one console because I don't believe that that's the case. I mean that game sold well and it was also on 360. It was also on PC. It's that they should have hel you know EA had the maybe didn't have the luxury to hold the game longer and let them do something with it.

So again, a perfect storm. It's a it's a it's it's the right situation for the right company with the right game and the right franchise at the right time. Exactly. And I think GTA is such the right franchise for that because Titanfall is a shooter at the end of the day. GTA, what is it? It's whatever the hell it's a racing game. It's a shooting game.

It's just like a more consumer friendly thing. But again, publishers aren't going to be making money doing that. So, or at least not the money they're used to being, you know, used to making these series has a creator before they do anything like that. Same thing with Call of Duty. like you know Activision has this suite of really talented developers that could just be making maps and story lines and all these kinds of things on a singular platform and doesn't force people to how frustrating was it for someone like Alfredo probably who you know or someone like him that plays Call of Duty and then they're really good at ghosts and then the next year they have to be really good at you know Modern",

Well, now see, the problem with that though is um you have to make sure that everybody on a competitive level that everyone has access to the new maps because whenever the second that you have like a paid map that not everybody gets, that's not a competitive map anymore because it's no one's going to play it because not everyone can play it. And um Alfredo's talked to me many times about this where it's just like he's not as good at the those maps cuz he never plays them. Like whenever new maps come, he's like, \"Okay, cool.

Like from the competitive angle at least, I don't know if that's necessarily the right way. Is that I mean, the biggest thing driving people forward is the competitive angle. Well, I mean, you're cuz are you talking about competitive gaming or you just talking about people who are competitive with each other?

Same thing's true with Smash Bros. where it's like, you know, there's rules for competitive Smash Bros. And like certain maps are legal, certain maps aren't. And even though we're not pros, we still kind of play by those rules just because it's like, oh, well, that's the real game, you know, and I feel like first person shooters also have that that set of standards, you know.

Street Fighter is another thing that would be interesting because I mean that's that's a game that they re re re-release. You know what I mean? Like it's just insane.

Um, you ever put on a cat? No. Yeah, it's not actually cat sized. Um, this is what we all called it, but yeah, it's it wasn't really.

It's a blank slate now, though. I'm not taking shots at Activision, but they were very much and Ghostbusters is always the example, right? They didn't pick up the Ghostbusters franchise when it came out because they said specifically, we want annualizable content. And that's what they did with Marvel, much to the chagrin of everyone, right? You're, oh, Wolverine movie, here's a Wolverine game.

Like there was issues about that, but like Deadpool is about to get his own movie with Ryan Reynolds again. You know what I mean? Like that's fan that's another one of those the fans are demanding it and demanding and demanding. If it doesn't perform at the movie theaters, then shut up about Deadpool everybody. But I think that, you know, it's much the way I feel about Marvel's movie slate. take a step back, figure out like what you want to do well and do that well, you know. And so with with the games, it's it's identify the publisher that owns the studios that you need uh to work with or, you know, find independent studios",

I think the best bet for them is to just make another alliance with another publisher that can handle their wares as much like they've done with EA with Star Wars and um it wouldn't surprise me if all of EA is going to be taking over their their games as well. You know, EA can scale up. EA can scale up and make two new studios just to do that and they're making plenty of money. So, it's just a matter of um if that's in the cards or not, you know. Yeah.

Yeah, but it's not, you know, to Greg's point, I agree with it. It could be anything. That's the thing is it could be anything. I mean, Batman's obviously a big name and that was Arkham Asylum was a game that came out in 2009 and was beloved by a lot of people, but it wasn't because it was a Batman game necessarily. It's because it was [\u00a0__\u00a0] good. Yeah. You know what I mean?

It's so hard to launch a new IP. Vanquish should have been Vanquish should have been GI Joe. I've said that a million times. Vanquish Vanquish. Vanquish Iron Man had a little more like fun. So, yeah, Vanquish was like one of the stars of PS3 and Xbox 360. That game was [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome.

And once you have that down, once you're running around on a white [\u00a0__\u00a0] mat, you know, with nothing on it, then you build a little bit more and build a little bit more, a little bit more. You don't deal with the lore first and then squeeze something into it. That's why I don't think I really don't think that's how they began Arkham Asylum. Like I think Oh, no. This I totally agree with you. I love the idea that there's developers out there making engines and gameplay and then trying to sell that to people and they're like, I love this for character X, you know, Batman, and we'll give you Paul Deany to come write the story and do this and like help you.

We go back to Dinosaur Planet Star Fox Adventures and it's just like, okay, this is not Star Fox. That's very, very, very weird.
