They just they were the the studio wasn't doing well, I guess, in the 90s, right? Yeah. Marvel went bankrupt. Even Yeah. Even early 2000s. Like, they had to sell. So they had they sold off the rights to all their major characters basically with the exception of I guess the biggest characters and Wolverine. X-Men. Yeah. Yeah. So they never can do X-Men again.

There are adult, like there are adults, right, that can go and see any movie they want and they have money and disposable income, right? But then there's there's children and young people and teenagers and their parents, whatever. It's the same thing we always talk about with Skylanders and and Disney Infinity and Amiios and stuff like eventually parents who are also going to bring their kids to see these movies because they're into comics.

They mate with No, there's like some they swarm or something like that. There's some name for it. And then they lose their wings and I think they die the males. Okay.
