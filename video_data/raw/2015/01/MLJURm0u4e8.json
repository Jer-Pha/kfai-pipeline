I'm pissed that you did the head thing, because I normally do the head thing. What head thing? What did he do? I always do the head thing. I always did it too, but then I forgot. I was smiling because this is like a special episode. You forget everything. And then you do the thing, and then you always nail the table thing. You never get the table thing. I never get that. You're bad at it. Hey guys, how's it going? It's a young man's game, the table thing. Over here! The Pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. It's good to be here. It's good to be here. Go Jets. Yeah, Go Jets. I think by this point everyone who's listening to this, Rex Ryan, would have been fired. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Over there, the Pier One, Tim Yetis. Let him host.

What is going on? 57 episodes, everybody. Time to start drinking. Yeah, please pour me some of that. Yeah, if there were ever a time to start drinking, now would be that time. We should all develop an alcoholism problem right now. Ladies and gentlemen, you know there's a usual rigmarole to how the show opens here, you know, four, sometimes five. We'll get to all that in a second. But I thought, well, maybe we should just do it now. Let's do it now. If you didn't know, this is the Game Over, Gregi Show. The idea is simple.

If you don't think we're worth the money or you don't have it, it's no big deal. You can wait and go to YouTube.com slash Kinda Funny Monday through Friday to get breakouts until the entire show is posted on YouTube and iTunes. There's also a store.

So we want these people whenever there's breaking news and stuff happens, we want to talk about it right when it happens. Hold on. Let's take a second. Kevin, when you're back on the mic, can you hear this? Oh, it didn't feel like that. Well, now I got two months. Do you want some? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Don't waste a little bit.

Right? Well, it's like we wouldn't have to wait for that show to get filmed to have this day to do that today. You can just have that as soon as the trailer drops. Yep. 30 minutes later you can have a conversation with Colin about it. That's where we thought that would fit. We can call the conversation with Colin if that makes him feel better.

Well, no, it was really good. I'm just being honest. I feel like we were really tired. I want to almost do it again for them. So I do apologize. Yeah, I'm so tired. We were so tired after that.

But nonetheless, during that stream, I said that it's entirely possible that, you know, I was really surprised by why everyone like people like when you when you tweeted that we were getting topics for the final season of Conversation with Colin, most of the tweets were like, why is it the final season of Conversation with Colin, not actual topics? And so I said, like, we're not going to do it anytime soon, but I'm sure that that show will come back at some point. If we really if that's what you really want in a couple of years. I hope that's not what you want in a couple of years. I hope that we're doing better things and that we can use our production time to make you better shows than that.

I can't remember how all the podcasts podcasts are rolling out. Sure. But I'm sure people are wondering why we decided to quit. Well, sure. All right.

So the other big part of January 5th and the relaunch and quitting our jobs is that we've launched kind of funny games, which is where we will actually talk about video games like this parlays into your question, too. So why why did we quit? We're doing all these things because we want to continue to have the conversation relationship. We started with you guys, the viewer slash listener. And the fact is, not many of you. And this isn't to offend you. I've put it together that when we worked at IGN, we could not talk about video games. We couldn't talk about current movies or TV.

And let me let's back up for a second. It wasn't that we necessarily couldn't talk about those things. It was just that we were asked not to write. I mean, that was kind of ideas. That's another way of saying we couldn't do it. Yeah, well, you could kill Greg right now. It's not that it was a point. What you're saying is perfectly legit. And I've always thought totally within IGN is right is the fact that you can come over we'll put a blur up so no one will ever know. You're like, Oh, there's anyone.

Why should we go home and do that at a cool company that has a lot of things together.

The kind of funny audience is the fact that we want to have those conversations with you on our own time, in our own way. We want to be able to react immediately and not be held to some schedule or be moved around here. So the fact is that we couldn't talk about games before so we started Kind of Funny Games where we will now be putting up Let's Plays every day.

Like let's, let's figure out how much we're all making and like, let's, let's figure out our minimum numbers to walk away. And then we launched the Patreon and saw that there were actually people out there that, that would give a shit if we left and that all of that numbers and all that conversation about money just went out the window.

So we sat around Kevin Smith's like badass Colombian drug lord, like, lair that he has and talked to him for four hours. At the end of which, Colin leans over and goes, the entire time I was leaning on a second draft of Clerks that had handwritten notes from Scott Mosier on it and there was a picture of Kevin Smith drawn on it from Scott Mosier.

If you were first off one of the 80,000 subs to Kinda Funny or if you were one of the people on the Patreon beforehand we thank you the most because you were the ride or die mother fuckers who were like oh yeah what princess do they want to have sex with? I'd love to know. You know what I mean? So many people I'm sure drop in on the shows and are like oh it's not a games or whatever and they bounce and it's like that's totally understandable. I'm not knocking that but I'm saying the people who have been here forever for us you are the best friends and will continue to add best friends now but at no point are we going to take for granted the people who have been here forever.

Yeah I agree and I think what's most exciting about it is that IGN has this huge reach and we've always been honored and thankful for that but we don't need that kind of reach to do what's satisfying for us and to satisfy the smaller group of people that want to kind of ride or die with us. Yeah the care about what we have to say. Which is I think what's so exciting like that's what's really invigorating to me is like I actually want to talk to a smaller group of people that like really care and really like that aren't there just because of a Stazzy headline or just there because it's the news of the day but because they want to know what we think about X, Y and Z and that's a smaller group of people than the millions",

Wow. Greg about as funny as a heart attack. That's a great way to call it is that we have a hopefully a group of people out there that want to be a part of something.
