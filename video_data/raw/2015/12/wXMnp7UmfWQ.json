My whole thing on it is I'm interested in that. It's settling in a lower Metacritic score than I thought it was gonna get. And it seems like people like it, but also have complaints that it seems pretty shallow. It's not a very hardcore shooter. But when I watch Greg play it, all I can think about is like, what a waste. This would have been an awesome single player game. Look at these models, look at these environments and the places they go and stuff like what a fucking waste. That's the only thing I can think of. That's all I have to say. I'm out. Now call in. So inherent in that though, is part of you looking at it and saying, holy crap, this looks awesome. Oh yeah, it looks amazing.

And like, these are people who are not necessarily down with watching video games. And they're like, it just looks so damn good. Right. Yeah. Christine was watching me play last night while she was packing for this trip and she was looking over and she was just like, this game is beautiful. This game is spectacularly pretty. The way the grass moves on indoors, you move around. Authentic is the word that I go to. It feels so, so, so Star Wars. And I love that so much. The thing, Colin, that I want you to know is there is not like a campaign mode, but there is single player missions. Yeah, that I know, but that's not. But they're worth doing.

But like they're fucking awesome. And the tutorial missions, like the Endor chase and like the X-wing thing. I did the X-wing one last night. I liked it. It's like, hey, all the fun shit that you want to do, here, you just get thrown right into it. And the survival modes, I haven't even played online at all. I've just done the single player stuff and I haven't had a great time with it. It's definitely shallow. It definitely is not a super, super deep shooter game.

And the way that the weapons systems work. It does feel like a Battlefront game compared to a Battlefield game, which I thought it was going to be a little bit more updated feeling than it is. Yeah. So I wonder campaign wise, like obviously a single player campaign is a whole different undertaking. That's a whole different scope of the project. What if they had done something like Titanfall where they are using the maps that you see in the competitive multiplayer using sections there and just kind of like scripting some waves of enemies and like loosely tying it together along sort of some kind of story involving an elite rebel squad or a specific imperial detachment. Like would that have done it for you? Yeah. Anything, it's just, I don't like multiplayer games. So I mean, it's just my bias against multiplayer. And I just see a studio",

And I just see a studio as talented as DICE, obviously with a lot of online bonafides making the game. Yeah. Something that, you know, Titanfall, I mean, is another game that's clearly suffered at retail and in longevity because of its lack of single player functionality in terms of like something meaningful. I mean, just because you can play a game by yourself doesn't mean it has a campaign or something that's worth delving into. I mean, this is not the spirit of the game though. So I understand that I'm looking for something that's not really there. But what I had mentioned on Colin and Greg, which I think would be fun and interesting and something that maybe they'll consider doing is like now the assets exist. Now this engine's obviously running in this particular way in this particular universe. Why not let, you",

So why not let DICE continue to do that and shift that shit off to another studio that can make, that can take a lot of those assets and just make a single player campaign for the next game or whatever. Because it's, I really feel like Battlefront is going to not benefit from having, not having a robust campaign in the same way that people complain about Titanfall. It's just that it's Star Wars, so it's going to sell 15 million copies or whatever and be totally fine. It's just, you know, I think there's more that could have been done here, especially considering the game isn't quite as deep as I expected it to be from, anecdotally from what I've been hearing from people.

And compared to some of the other shooters, people play like COD or something like that. Well what's interesting is like, is that good enough, right? Like you, I'm right there with you. I don't play multiplayer games, right? That's not really what I get into. I don't get into shooters all that much either. And like, it was, I forget what trailer it was where we were watching it. I was like, damn, that actually looks kind of interesting. And then I watched you guys do your Let's Plays, like damn, that looks fun.

And that's the thing is like, it's just right now, it's that perfect level of like, it is, it is definitely a light, you know, first person shooter. It isn't, you know, getting in and trying to play Call of Duty or something online for me, which has been a turnoff.

Have I moved on to something else or is it still that fun Bazooka Joe distraction, right? Of like, well, I got 30 minutes, why not play a little bit?

But in terms of like competitive play, in terms of a multiplayer shooter kind of pace and feel, I think that Battlefront casting the net wide is a great thing. I think that people who see these commercials of the X-wing coming up outside of a building and like jumping out, like I think those people exist in the millions. Like I have like maybe like 10% of my friends that I grew up playing with video games still actively play video games today.

And so yeah, it is awesome for him. And I think that the visual spectacle, the fact that it is so Star Wars, the fact that it's backed by dice, like it just sounds incredible. And then also, you know, there are bullet tracers and stuff you can see in Battlefield, but seeing blaster fire, like that just gives, like the fact that it's a neon line streaking across, it just gives the battlefield such a great feel. I think that it's a success in a lot of ways and I've been having a good time with it, but yeah, it's a good question. Am I gonna be digging it in two weeks? I don't know.

And it's fun because, it's interesting I should say, because like the night one when I was out there and you were talking to me about it, Colin, right? We were having this conversation about multiplayer shooters and how there's no story.

So it's, I'm curious as an outside observer, I'm a huge Star Wars fan. I'm a fucking massive Star Wars fan, but as an outside observer who has no interest in playing this game, I'm interested in two things. I'm interested in seeing the legs on this game. The game's clearly gonna sell, but we saw a significant, again, Titanfall is really the ancillary to this in terms of a game that had no single player offerings that made people wanna keep the game for a long period of time. And I know that people point at Call of Duty and are like, well, who cares about the campaign? Well, a lot of people do.

And I was in the minority and they're like, our statistics show that it's actually more than you think. So I'm interested to see the legs of this game.

So I'm, as an outside observer, I'm just interested to see how this does.

But I wanted it to be kind of reasonably plausible that people were gonna get access to it.

Well, yeah, the parameters of your life change. As you grow older, your job situation, your family situation, your living situation, all this changes and gaming. I think there are so many different ways for gaming to adapt to that, you know, like, yeah, like I like, did I beat the Witcher 3? No. Is it like one of my favorite games of the year? Yeah.

I think that you need to go back to its core and then figure out what made it good to begin with and then go from there. I'm with you though. In the sense that Tecmo Koei doesn't really need to do this because it reminds me a little bit of valve to a much lesser degree. We were talking about half-life three and like the imperative of doing it. Like there's no reason for them to make that game. They will, but there's no reason for them to actually do it.

You have to wonder the viability of even a studio, a company like that investing the money because to make it, to make a proper Ninja guide and game that this person's probably envisioning would cost 30, $40 million, maybe.

How much that actually would affect sales though. Like just like the fact that you could play the old one on it, would that really affect an HD version of those games being made? Well, they're already in HD. So that's what I'm saying.

So you can have an intellectually honest conversation about like, I think Gawker is garbage, but I don't think Kotaku is garbage. And I don't think the people that work there are garbage. I think that there are some of the best people in the industry. And so you have to look at things like selectively and find the people that you trust in your life.
