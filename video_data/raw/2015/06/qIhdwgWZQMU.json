Right. Now, here's the thing. This is probably my favorite mobile game of all time. You hate on the mobile games. I do. There's a few mobile games I like, but I Plants vs. Zombies, I.e., but yeah. Yeah, I do hate. I'm not I wouldn't say I'm a fan of mobile games, but I'm a fan of good mobile games. I'm a fan of one. There's some that I've, you know, really sunk a lot of time into. This is probably the one I spent the most time playing. Okay. Do I wish I had that time back? Yes, I do. But it did mobile games, right? And it was the first time I played one that I was like, I get it now. I understand why people get addicted to this [\u00a0__\u00a0] What's What year did this come out? God, I don't even know. It must have been years ago at this point. 2011, I think. 2011, I would say, was when I was when I really got into it. I",

Now, what made it beautiful is it's just one of those endless scrolling games. You just got to see how far you can get. Okay, that alone is not that crazy. You just hit one button and it's fine. What made it crazy was these missions. So, okay, what this is, it's trophies that never end. You never get all of them. Oh, I don't know if I like that. Actually, they just continuously give you more just achievements and things to do. And there's this whole star system cuz it's like you get a freaking trophy for play three games. It's just like it lets you know how many you have to go and all this stuff. Interesting. Ooh, I like that it tells you how many to go. So it's not like a nebulous format.

So it's just one button though, right? Yeah. Any button you want. So coins. You collect these coins and you can kill these little scientists. Your name Barry. Um I don't know. They're mean. They were doing experiments on Oh, they're trying to make a jetack. That's what it was. Okay. So why is that a bad thing? It seems like they're just trying to use their STEM. You know, they have expensive STEM degrees and they have to pay their loans back. So, it's, you know, it's pretty easy for the first while, but if you just stay in the same section for a bit, then uh you the little exclamation mark will come up on the right and the missile will shoot across wherever it is.

Then there's all these vehicles you can get to just cause like they all act differently. Some is that supposed to be an Angry Bird? I don't know. Oh, probably profit bird. That makes sense. Oh god. Oh dear. Now what's cool? The vehicles give you an extra hit. Okay. It's a one hit kill system in this game. Oh god. Oh god. Yeah. I mean, I can see why this would be fun. Oh, I have to be honest with you. Oh god. Oh dear. Oh no. No. Oh no. Oh no.

You get a little far because like some of the things here you get bombs like little dynamite. When you die, the dynamite will go off and push your body farther. It's great. So, that's replaced. Actually, it's funny. Okay, so I'm in Men's Room Mayhem, which is a VA game that went to iOS. They they stole this this achievement system where you have three at any one time and then they would just fill them back in, right? So, I could see where they got it from. They clearly got it from this game. And they get hard, you know, and you really start to learn this game and like the tricks of using the vehicles to get a little bit farther and like purposely die. It's kind of like using Yoshi in Mario World where you can jump off them to get height for certain jumps. Um, and there's other ones where you start getting uh points and stuff for near",

All we have bird again. This one's kind of weird. Just makes you really heavy and you can like keep tapping to jump. There's like a badass dragon like robo dragon that like flies through and he's really cool and he goes fast. There's a motorcycle. That's insanity. So, let me So, you've played this on mostly on the touch screen. How do you feel about it? How's the tactile nature of the game when you're playing on a controller? Is it better? It's the same.

I don't quite understand your motive for killing these scientists. Yeah, there's like achievements for like kill 100 scientists seems kind of [\u00a0__\u00a0] up. Oh no. All right. Like why the hostility? You know what I mean? If you want to escape, that's fine. You know, I don't know. Oh man. Certainly not all of these people are responsible for the the bad going on. Oh, nice. Damn. Oh, there we go. Oh, so you're revived. You keep going. I see. That's pretty cool. Oh, and another coin. Yeah, I can see where this become would become like a crack cocaine kind of game.

And then you can cash in your um the coins that you you get and uh when you get the stars then you you get certain levels and it's like you think the level 10 is the highest, but then it's like you get that it's not. I don't even know what the highest is or if there's a highest, but some of my friends certainly there must be, right? Way more than me. And then you can go into the stash and buy different jetpacks. Oh, cool. And a lot of them are just aesthetic. So, it's like Oh, so they don't actually do anything. Like bubblegum will come out instead of whatever or like golden piggy bank or it's just like coins are flying out and stuff.

And this Barry doesn't have a story of any kind except that they were experimenting. There was an opening cinematic video that we skipped, but we got the the Super Saiyan suit. So, that's kind of cool. Yeah, I like I mean this this looks fun. Yeah, it's DJ Barry. I saw DJ Barry, man. It's Yeah, it's definitely cool. I have the machine gun jetack right now. Oh, so that your backpack doesn't always do that. Yeah. No, normally it's just a jetpack and it won't kill these things. It It won't kill. You have to like actually hit them.

After the next time I die, I want to hand you the controller. I wonder if I'll be any Probably not very good. It is cool though, like you can just hit any of these buttons and it does the same thing. Yeah, it's cool. I mean, it's it's easy to understand. Uh, this one's hard to use. So, the thing bounces and it just shoots you. H, it shoots you randomly or you choose when it shoots you.

Like those you you're waiting for those laser things cuz those are easy to kind of get a lot of momentum on. I don't want to attack you, buddy. But what impressed me so much about this game is that this is the same flash helicopter game I played like 15 years ago on the computer. Oh, here we go. Mr. Tuddles.

I mean, it's simple and it's been done a million times, but I like the whole achievement system and you constantly feel like every single time you play, you're building towards something. And that's the trick of these [\u00a0__\u00a0] games is that you really don't need to build towards any of it. It's not really doing anything. It's like, oh, but if I have that different power up, then I'll be able to get a little farther. It's like, why am I getting a little farther so I can get the next power up? And they just never stop.
