I don't know how many goddamn Batman movies are left now. Now, here's the thing. As as a little bat fact to go along with that Rock and Robin intro, in one draft of the script, a reference to Robin being related to Rachel Dawze was considered. Uh, the character of Dick Grayson was not explicitly mentioned. However, Rachel Daws is revealed as being a relative of the Grayson family. Christopher Nolan had it removed because he didn't want to build up hope about Robin appearing in a future movie. That was smart. Yeah, I agree.

All of Ledger's scenes appear as he completed them in the filming. In editing the film, Nolan added no digital effects to alter Ledger's actual performance. Uh Nolan decided to dedicate the film in part to Ledger's memory. That was one of those moments, man. Like I, you know, I think I know obviously so many, we most of us, if not all of us, probably watching it lived through it or remember it to some extent, but I remember like that was a moment, the first time at IGN where like time stopped where it was like a full stoppage of like I remember I I remember it was the old Brisbane",

The Batman theme is heard only twice in this movie as composers Han Zimmer and James Newton Howard decided that a heroic theme that a viewer could hum would overlook the complexity and darkness of the character. Hearing the tune only twice would create what Zimmer calls a musical foreshadowing. God, they're cool. Does you know which moments those were? Cuz I think one of them is the SWAT team moment.

I think he just doesn't like going back and re-recording the dialogue for any of his actors. So, he just lets it go.

In spite of the film's critical success, the film was noticeably absent from the best picture nominee list, prompting controversy and leading many to criticize the Academy Awards for snubbing the film.

This is, you know, this is one of the few movies I own on Blu-ray and watching it again, like and it's been a few years, but watching it again, like when we started amping up to the like, [\u00a0__\u00a0] we're really moving. I can't believe it's gone this quickly. But it is those things of the movie is so well done that like it's the obviously been me'd [\u00a0__\u00a0] but like when [\u00a0__\u00a0] Harvey wakes up in bed and looks at the Joker and he's just got the mask on and there's no reaction and then when he peels off the mask and Harvey freaks out like, \"Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's the Joker.\" It's like, what gave it away the first [\u00a0__\u00a0]",

Tim, uh, Nick earlier mentioning that, you know, obviously the I don't know if Tim, are we done with the facts? I mean, there's a million facts. A real quick fact I want to just remember what you're saying. I want to jump off what Greg was saying.

Nolan felt using makeup would look unrealistic as it adds to the face unlike real burn victims. uh Frametorm acknowledged they rearranged the position of bones, muscles, and joints to make the character look more dramatic. But after looking at a whole bunch of different options, they were like, \"This is this is what it has to be without looking too real, but still feeling grounded.\" That's and I think it's wonderful.

There's a couple things in this movie that like after watching it a bunch of times, I finally watched it this last time a little bit more critically. There's a couple shots in this that I'm like, huh, why would that be the way it is? First off, why would they save his suit? Wouldn't they just throw that out? Where'd he get the other half of the suit? They needed the suit to be like half burned down the side. I'm like, what would I know? There's that. There's a moment where he got put into the hospital.

And this movie does that on like seven different levels at all times with the villains and the main characters and the side characters.
