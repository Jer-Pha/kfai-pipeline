X thing where he follows you around everywhere but there are spots in the game where he does follow you around uh-huh and you don't necessarily know there yeah there he is right now you can't so right here for example you can run away from him it doesn't cause he will do that he'll know I've had like I've been in situations where okay I'm gonna run down these stairs and there's no way he'll catch me I saw him grind down a [\u00a0__\u00a0] trail Sonic Adventure 2 style I go soap shoes yeah the basically just come in front of me and then Hillary's not slower than",
