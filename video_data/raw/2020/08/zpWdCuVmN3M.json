I'm one of your hosts, Blessing Adi Jr. And joining me is host of PS I Love You XOXO, Greg Miller. They call me Cool Ranch. Is that what they call you? Cool Ranch. That's what I'm saying. They call me now. What are you going to do about that? Where'd that come from? Uh, Doritos. Doritos has a flavor called Cool Ranch Doritos that I don't like that much. or I guess grew up not liking that blessing. It's really good. Greg has weird taste buds, but it's I mean I love I'm trying to figure out where the where the nickname comes from cuz now it makes even less sense. They call you cool ranch cuz you don't like cool ranch. No, he didn't like it growing up. He likes it now. Blessing. Some of the best nicknames don't make sense. That's why we call Kevin Pistol Pete.

You can follow the instructions or you can tech it out, you know, kind of just see where you like levels. So what I found out so far, light roast not great for very acidic. And the whole reason I got the the coffee maker is because it reduces the acidity in how you make it cuz it doesn't heat up and like uh cook the coffee. So I've now tried a darker roast. Really really good but too much water. Tomorrow when I make coffee or whatever I'm going to do yeah 750 milliliters of water and fill it up with ice. And I I that's 250 milliliters less of water. So I think that's going to put us around 500 milliliters total yield. And I think that's going to be what we want. Would you say it's it's been a good investment?

It's time for some news. We have five stories today. A baker's dozen. Oh, somebody get Kevin help. Get him a milkshake. His throat needs it. Throat coat. Our number one, Xbox considered splitting Halo Infinite into different sections upon release. This is from Andy Robinson at Video Games Chronicle. Speaking during Gary Widow's Animal Talking Twitch show, yes, Spencer apologized for not hitting expectations, but said he believed the delay was the right decision for Xbox and Halo Infinite. Quote, \"Let me let me start by recognizing the fans in the fact that it is a bummer. It is disappointing to people. It's disappointing to us. We were looking forward to",

We were looking forward to the alignment of Halo Infinite and the Xbox Series X. He added, \"In the end, I have to make the right decision. The strength of the Halo franchise, the health and ability of the team are things tracking toward the quality of where you want the game.\" Uh Spencer went on to reveal that his team, including 343's Bonnie Ross, and Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty, considered breaking Infinite into sections and releasing individual parts at different dates. However, quote, \"It just didn't feel right to all of us. like it just did it just didn't feel right to all of us like the Halo release that we would want.

There's there's all this drama he has to actually kind of a deal and dress with somewhere and he talked a little bit about the mindset and the post show about how to go into that.

But hey, shout out to Gary Wood on that. But no, this is new information. I don't think you have to worry about doubling up on things. But yeah, I think the thing that strikes me as interesting about this is the fact that there Xbox seems to be treating Halo almost like as more of a priority than even the Xbox Series X launch, if that makes sense. Like th and this this thought kind of started for me with them announcing that Halo Infinite multiplayer is going to be free to play, right? And that brings up the question of oh wow, wouldn't that have been a hit on Xbox Game Pass? Oh wow, what does that do for uh uh Xbox services, right? Xbox Live Gold if Halo's multiplayer is going to be free to play. Um, and",

Um, and I think what where I personally come down on that is the fact that oh yeah, Halo is going to benefit greatly from being available for be from being available to everyone, right? Anybody being able to jump into that game and play for free is going to extend the lifespan of that game. It's going to make the player it's going to expand the player base. It's going to make that game in terms of it being a live service game or just a platform in general. It's going to breathe life into it more so for the for Halo for that Halo game and Halo as a franchise more so than an Xbox, right? Or an Xbox service.

Has 343 ever nailed this? Have they ever made a game to rival a Bungie Halo? And I think the answer, and I could be wrong talking my ass, but from what I understand from the audience is no, they haven't. And in fact, they've made arguably disappointing or just middle-of-the-line Halo games. I think that they know with Halo Infinite they cannot do that. They know that. 343 knows that. I'm 343 knows that. Xbox knows that. Phil's team knows that. And so, yeah, like if the Halo franchise was in a different place, I think you could have seen what Phil's talking about here of",

Let's give it in the chapter by chapter single player, maybe multiplayer is ready to be put out on its own. X, Y, and Z. There's different ways to slice this. But in the reality of where Halo is as an IP right now, I'm not saying this is a make or break game, but you want this to be the return to greatness, not just another Halo. I remember when Halo I remember, you know, uh when the world stopped for Halo releases, and that kind of isn't that isn't the case anymore. Same thing with Gears, but that's a different argument for this in particular. Yeah, you they can't have Halo Infinite be a disappointment. They can't have Halo Infinite not be a great game.

So, what's your take on it once once upon a time possibly being a split release in terms of, hey, let's put out the single player now and then put out the multiplayer later. Do you think that's something they could have gotten away with? I know we're not necessarily the biggest the biggest Halo people here to make that call, but I I'm actually pretty shocked slashimpressed that they made the move of, hey, let's just delay everything and make it come and let it come out when it's full.

I play Halo for multiplayer.\" If you would have just put out the multiplayer, is it where they want it to be? You know, that's the other part of this too is they talked about should putting out these things in pieces. Are any of the pieces feature complete? Are they exactly where they want to be? I think it honestly would have been maybe even more likely to get it in chapters where all right we're putting out the first three chapters of Halo Infinite single player.

You know what I Tim always talks about it, right, of they him and all his friends coming home with it, tearing through their first playthrough, playing through together, then just getting lost in multiplayer. Like even though we see that getting changed every day, you know, the industry continues to evolve. Look at Call of Duty and the way they've handled multiplayer and single player campaigns uh these past few years, uh that can keep changing. But for a game that when they debut it and people either love it or hate it, the argument is we're trying to make it look like Halo 1. trying to make bring you back to Halo's roots.

I think it's the same thing here where they 343 and Microsoft have been clear that like this is meant to be a hearkening back to what Halo is. This is meant to be the essence of Halo. And I think that again, you could have broken it up and you could have put it out, but that would not be the essence of Halo. You would not be giving the people the Halo experience that they expect and want out of this. Greg Myro writes in into patreon.com/coname just like you, Canon says, \"Hello, Greg and blessing.

I understand that Sony got a considerable advantage due to Xbox's blunder with the Connect and and the all-in-one entertainment platform they advertise the Xbox One as, but the Connect is a mistake Microsoft made without without a clear view of the repercussions to come. What if delaying Halo proves to be another huge mistake? In essence, my question is, can you see the delay of Halo Infinite leading to a launch for the Xbox Series X that is as troubled as the launch of the One X? I guess just the Xbox One.

It is another generation. It is a step above everything, you know, and Xbox is from a platform now in saying they're a platform and saying that the best place to play is on the Xbox Series X. So, jump in if you want to. And I think there's going to be a lot of people who go, \"Yep, I'm all in. I love my Xbox.

These are new prices for the inapp currency in both the PC and console versions of the game. On mobile, however, things are a bit more complicated. On both iOS and Android, Epic has introduced a new direct payment option. If you purchase V-Bucks or anything else in the game through either the App Store or the Google Play Store, it'll cost the same as always, but the new direct option comes with a discount. When you select it, the game sends you to a payment screen where you can choose either a credit card or PayPal. quote, \"Currently, there are no savings in if there are no savings if players use Apple and Google payment options payment options where Apple and Google Google collect an exorbitant 30% fee on all payments.\" Epic",

It's not clear exactly how Epic is able to get around those fees, but here's some more details uh from the company company's FAQ. Uh then the first question from there epic you ask why has Epic decided to implement its payment system for purchases inside Fortnite on iOS and Android and their answer by offering an alternate payment system we're not only offering players more choice but we're able to pass along those savings to players and then the second question does a new does a new payment method on mobile means per mean purchases there are does a new payment method on mobile mean purchases there are less safe response no thousands of thousands of apps on the App Store",

Tony Hawk's Pros Skater Oneplus 2 will include a classic trick with a new name in honor of the trick's original creator. Skateboarders and fans of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series are likely well aware of what a mute air or a mute grab is. But what uh many might not know the history of the trick's name.

The Indie Air had just been created and named, so somebody proposed that grabbing the grabbing with the front hand should be known as the tracker air. Hawk explained that because Wed was the first to do that trick, the trick should be named after him. Wed was often referred to as the quiet mute guy, Hawk said, and so the mute air was made. Hawk admitted that he and the other skaters went along with the name in in naivity, not realizing that Wedle might not have agreed with the name. Quote, \"In recent years, a few people have reached out to Chris, who still skates, about this trick and the name it was given.\" Hawk said, \"He has been",

I asked him last year as I was diving into Trick Origins, and he said he would rather he would have rather named it the deaf or wet grab if given the choice.\" End quote. Hawk said the Wedle uh the Wed's exact words were quote, \"I am deaf, not mute.\" End quote. When players when players boot up Tony Hawk Pro Skater on OnePlus 2, they'll find that the trick is now called the Wedle Grab. So, it's that's a pretty cool story. I included that.

PS4's Ghost of Sushima is the highest rated fan game of the entire generation. This is Paul Tassy at Forbes. I've been tracking this for a while now, but I'm ready to make the declarative statement. According to the math, the recent release of Ghost of Sushima is the most fanbeloved game of the entire generation. At least according to Metacritic's user scores, the best metric we have to track that sort of thing. Weeks ago, I reported that Ghost of Sushima was racking up thousands of reviews and had an impressive 9.3 out of 10 for a user score. Higher than it met higher than his critic meta score of an 83. actually a bit low in the grand catalog of PS4 releases.

One, because like congratulations Ghost Ghost of Sushima. That's actually pretty impressive. But then also, I believe Ghost of Sushima was the first big game after The Last of Us Part Two where they decided to uh um put a hold on user scores until I think like 36 hours or some something around that range after the game came out.
