His friend's daughter and her peers inspired Miyazaki as they were on the verge of adolescence and extremely apathetic. Uh the aura decided he needed to make a movie for 10-year-old girls. There wasn't a lot out there for them. Their magazines were heavily focused on romance and crushes, and I felt this was not what they had, what they held dear in their hearts, not what they wanted, the filmmaker recalled. And so, I wondered if I could make a movie in which they could be heroins. Miyazaki wanted a movie that was made for regular 10-year-old girls. The main character had to be ordinary with no special abilities or traits. The girls needed someone human to relate to and show them that they could be heroins, too. The main character was made with the girls from the cabin in mind. Every time I wrote or drew something concerning the character of Chihiro and her actions, I asked myself the",

That reminds me of that reminds me of William Goldberg back in the day. He was an 80s screenwriter and novelist was going on a trip and he he used to write stories for his daughters and uh he his daughters didn't want him to go on this trip and he said, \"Well, you know, I'll write you a story when I'm on the trip. What do you want it to be about?\" One of his daughters is a princess and the other was a bride, so he wrote the princess bride for them. That's really cool.

Um, but yeah, a lot of similarities between Miyazaki and Jay-Z, including the the retirement, but also this extremely fun fact that uh I I'm surprised it took me this long to to to realize, but I think that it's a a crazy one for this movie, but retroactively looking back, it's very impressive. Despite having a rich plot with developed characters, Spirited Away was not made with a script. In fact, Miyazaki's films have never had scripts. quote, \"I don't have the story finished and ready when we start work on a film for a [\u00a0__\u00a0] animated film. What the hell?\" Uh, that's inefficient. I usually don't have the time. So, the story develops when I start drawing storyboards. The production starts very soon",

The production starts very soon thereafter while the story boards are still developing. Uh, quote, \"Myazaki does not know where the plot is going, and he lets it happen organically. It's not me who makes the film. The film makes itself, and I have no choice but to follow.\" That's awesome. That's really cool. That's a really cool thing to say. very very terrifying thing to like await a world cuz it's like oh yeah a lot of movies go to [\u00a0__\u00a0] when because they don't have stories done first it's just crazy but uh I don't know if you understand my reference to Jay-Z there Nick but I might teach you something today.

That's that that I it was the first time I thought or or conceived of the concept that like you could just make a narrative movie that wasn't about people [\u00a0__\u00a0] beating the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of each other and and how they tell a story like that.

This was like what was the um the movie that people said in chat that Nick would love Vietnam Warrior 7. Okay, that's that was for 80s live action movie. That was that was fun of me for always bringing up Hard to Kill, which I stand by. Hey, that's a good point, Nick. I stand by the chat is telling me that I'm wrong about that and that your name beat it a year or two ago. So, the list that I was looking at must have been out of date then. So, it is now number two.

Pixar animator John Lacader, a fan and friend of Miyazaki, convinced Walt Disney Pictures to buy the film's North American distribution rights and served as executive producer of its English dub version. Lacader then hired Kirk Weise as director and Donald Ernst as producer.

Uh advertising was limited with Spirited Away being mentioned only in a small scrolling section of the film section of Disney.com. Disney had sidelined their official website for Spirited Away and given the film a comparatively small promotional budget. The reason for this uh was because Studio Jibli had retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters which limited Disney's ability to properly market the film. So they were pretty much like we're just going to put it out because we believe in it but like we're not really going to back it off. This movie could have done a lot better had uh they given it the the proper push. But that's pretty Yeah, they had that the true Disney bump. That's cool.

It won the Academy Award for best animated feature at the 75th Academy Awards, making it the first and to date only handdrawn and non-English language animated film to win that award. In 2016, it was voted the fourth best film of the 21st century by the BBC uh as picked by 177 film critics from around the world, making it the highest ranking animated film on the list.

Number six, Porco Rosso. And number seven, Castle in the Sky. Where y'all want to put this one? Spirited Away above Toro. This where I want to go right here, guys. Remember remember, let me bring you back to a little indie film called Avengers Endgame. Iron Man looks over at Doctor Strange and he's like, \"Is this the one?\" And he goes, \"Number one.\" And number one, really? No. Yeah. No. I agree with Nick actually. And here's my thing, guys. Like, last week I saw Princess Monoke and I'm like, this is one of my favorite movies I've ever seen. I still stand by Princess Monoke is more of my favorite. Spirited Way is better. Number one. Wow. Yeah, boy. Tim, get on the right side of history. Movie. Come on, guys. Are you serious? Come on. Come on. No. Here's my thing. I love Monoke is dope as [\u00a0__\u00a0] So [\u00a0__\u00a0] dope. So [\u00a0__\u00a0]",

But this reminds me of those 80s movies, early 90s movies of being a kid. And I'm an adult watching this and it's like [\u00a0__\u00a0] bringing me back to that. Like it's not just nostalgic. It's like transporting me into the world now. And I love that. I didn't know that was possible. And there's just it every single element of this movie comes together in a way that just feels different than anything we've seen before. Whereas I think Princess Monoke to me is just a 10 out of 10 version of things we've seen before. Yeah. But I I don't Both very close. I think different means better is all I'm saying. I I am much more uh um I am much more on the side of the story that is sort of this environmentalist story where even the bad guys aren't necessarily",

I just prefer that story along with the two protagonists. Um I I just I don't I think Monoke is just so much more enthralling whereas this movie just and this movie got me emotionally at the end, but it's still kind of just everything thrown at the wall and you enjoy it because it looks beautiful. And that's I think I like Spirited Away because it's more of a hero's journey and touches on more of an internal conflict and then and then an external conflict. Also, there's a lot less violence, which is always Does it touch more on an internal? Because I feel like all of it is based off of like things affecting this main character",

And I feel like she doesn't I think that's the whole point of the end and her being like, \"Oh, she's braver.\" Yeah. Well, she they were like, \"You don't have to give her the test.\" She's like, \"No, give me the test. I got Whereas in the beginning she was just so like you know the moment where she Yeah. And then the moment she can't stand up I took that as like I can't like I can't do this. There's too much pressure. Like she has to save everyone. She has to save Haku. She has have to save her parents. And she just does all of that. And in the beginning when she's in the car cuz we like the scene in the car she's just like I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to do this. I want to stay. Why do we have to leave? And",

Why do we have to leave? And she's like very whiny. And um at the end she feels more in control of um kind of the unknown that she's going into and I find that a really compelling story a lot. I like it too. It's more cerebral. Right. I think Princess Monoke is there's no disrespect to that. It's a very very beautifully perfectly done film. Um, but this is a little bit more of a thinker and I think it uses the medium a little bit in more new and crazy weird ways. Just like those '8s movies back in the day where you'd watch them like I don't quite grasp this because either it's either maybe it's too bananas for me or maybe it's just a little too deep for me where I think this has a lot a lot more depth to it. And again, Monoke has a tremendous amount of depth, but I just feel like this is this is a little bit more um art",

Um, and I just I just vibed with this, man. I just I just like that. It reminds me of lit literally the end of Time Bandits where this poor kid has been put through this whole thing and he his house burns down and you think, \"Okay, well that's the worst that's going to happen to him.\" But then no, his parents have been turned into lobsters and then the movie ends. They never save the parents. This kid is just [\u00a0__\u00a0] And that like that kind of stuff sits with you. You know, like I don't know why I'm I mean, you know, I got to un unpack that.
