Clearly something a game like this, a games as a service we need to follow up on. And so I think the best way we thought to do it was probably you've been through the story so far, so we can talk about that today, but we can also just also talk about where we're at in the video game and what's been going on.

Yeah, I'm so excited for whenever Hawkeye comes through. Whenever like they do story expansions that are the Hawkeye one is called Taking Aim, right? Because I really think that might be Kate Bishop. She might be taking aim and then Oh, do they have different like different things? Yeah, there's two releases there. Yeah, October is I assume there are one. No, no, no.

I imagine the story expansions will have cutscenes akin to what we've gotten with the campaign and story stuff akin to that, but that might I might be placing my expectation too high. Either way, if if I can get more story stuff and get more of that similar kind of enjoyment that I got out of the campaign, then yes, I'm gonna be looking forward to the Kate Bishop and the Clint whatever his name is uh stuff in the Spider-Man stuff coming in the future.

So I've maxed out on the drops and then you know I'm actually 132, but by choice I'm not spending my materials until I kind of get the stuff in the spreadsheet right and and level up the way I want.

I just want to pause full stop cuz I understand everything you're saying but I appreciate I'm like top level where are you at and you're immed like deer drops are 130 but I'm doing this and I got that like but I'm saying I was top level power.

Um, strategically I kind of decided not to play as Captain America or Thor or Hulk, which I really wanted to, but I said, you know what, I like the feel of Black Widow kind of for the reasons that uh Blessing was citing and um it's been a lot of fun and yeah, so of course beat the campaign. Um I've been clearing the map, you know, I played about 3540 hours. I've been trying to do everything. Sure. Iron Khan, where are you? Uh so I finished the campaign.

Cap can't do both for whatever reason. But, okay. So, I wrote down the what level I was and every and the power for every character because it wasn't until I wrote these down that I realized I have no idea what the correlation is. None whatsoever. Sure. So, M Marvel is level 10, 19 power. Hulk is level 10, 16 power. Iron Man is level 11, 29 power. Thor is level 9, 15 power. Cap level 17, 31 power. Black",

I assume it is mostly gear, but also like why do I have like why is gear dropping in such like non-commensurate rates? To what your your level? Yeah, to my level or like cuz I used to play campaign and then I try to play through multiplayer like moving around characters but still like I was still getting the same gear or same level gear that I had before. So I don't really know path two different things. It's confusing and makes no sense until you wrap your head around it. Um level is your skill points is the easiest way to think about it. You get 50 skill points to level up all your skill trees. So each character that that's what you're seeing is each one of those levels is",

So, it's two completely different things and it is and correct me if I'm wrong, Fran, because again what I was what I've been talking to people about when I talk about Oh, so I guess so for me, Marvel's Avenger, sorry. Uh, a week a week later of playing this, I guess a week and a half now playing it, right? Uh, I'm maining Captain America. He's level 50. I've beaten the story. He I had I guess I did that last week.

If let's say, you know, Imran's playing Captain America and that's his character. If we dropped in and he's like, \"Well, I only play Cap.\" I'd be like, \"Okay, cool. I can play somebody else.\" I didn't expect the endgame to be, and Fran, here's where I'll start getting out of my comfort zone and need you to explain or tell me if I'm right or wrong. I didn't expect the endgame to be so Destiny where Destiny has you going for light all the time, right? And I remember this when I talk about Destiny and and enjoying both",

And it is sitting there and doing the same missions over and over again. And like for me in Destiny, when it turned me off was patrolling the moon looking for the uh you know the the ingredients I needed to go change things up. I expected that to be the same case here. I've been playing mainly uh I've been playing with a whole bunch of different friends uh from the industry, but mainly it's me and Goldb every night with then a a cycling cast of characters playing with us.

And you know when he was he was a little bit in front of me explaining stuff about how this all works because again yeah to try to simplify the convoluted nature of all this and what an endgame is right. 130 is as high as the gear goes naturally for drops for what you'd find. However, you can then use your upgrades. You can take the materials you've acquired and use that to then upgrade the equipment 10 levels up to 140. And then one of your artifacts you can upgrade to give you plus up to plus 10 power, thus getting you to 150 as your power level. And I know that's weird and crazy and whatever. It's it makes more sense when you get into it. And when I was having that explained to me, I was very much like not a [\u00a0__\u00a0] chance cuz it it's, you know, like uh Simon Cardi from IGN we've been playing with me in Goldarb and he devoured this game and was so far ahead of us.

But it was that thing of when he was on this grind to 150. It takes so long from 140 to 150 to actually make progress because once it becomes gathering the resources and the materials, you need copious amounts of resources to then spend on these upgrades to get one point. And it's not that the one point immediately goes in, it's then the average of all your gear and it's all the stuff and yada yada yada. But I totally lied to myself and now that I'm there, it's all I want to do. And I won't stop until caps 150. And so I'm just running the same villain sectors every day and running the same missions and taking on the same things. And you know, to open this up, I'm having a blast with it.

Mike Fehee's uh review went up, and I'd like to read you the first three paragraphs because I think it sums up a lot of what's happening. Uh, there are many things I do not like about Marvel's Avengers, one of the best comic book video games I've played. I don't like grinding missions to earn more powerful equipment so I can take on more difficult missions. I don't like my heroes inventory slowly filling with junk until I have to pause the game and spend 30 seconds dismantling useless garbage.

But none of that can top the feeling of Thor's hammer slamming into a robot's metal body, Captain America's shield flying true, Iron Man's rockets hitting home, the Hulk's earthshattering rage, Black Widow's sting, and Miss Marvel's shape-shifting fists and feet. In the heat of battle, even a battle I fought a dozen times, the sheer joy of being one of Earth's mightiest heroes drowns out all the little irritations.

And also worth noting, this is it anniversary of the launch of Destiny 1. Yes, it's been six years since 2014 when uh Destiny launched and a lot of games have been trying to chase that, right? I mean, uh you have games out there like Division. Obviously, Borderlands had set the original pace of like loot drops and stuff, but yeah, Destiny for shooters really took that Diablo, you know, style to heart and started to turn it into these action games that you see.

So you can power your gear up to 140 and when your friends tell you, \"But wait, you can get to 150.\" It's confusing at first, you're like, \"Yeah, but you have this special artifact that is separate from all the other things that you can power up that Destiny just introduced, I think, was last year.\" Uh, and so that's like a recent development that I'm even seeing now in this game. I don't know if it's like a World of Warcraft thing because I know that sure Luke Smith and the team they're are big fans. But the what's interesting is you now this is what you're going to see.

I have a lot of commentary on where the endgame's at and it's certainly it's got a lot of content it's going to need to add, but it's a it's a heck of a start. Imran, I want to turn to you because obviously Blessings talked about being a single player and being or you know a campaign player and it's done. Me and Fran are grinding.

Yeah, I mean I would say if the the good news is it does have scaling um for you know all the characters. So if you come in for the most part there's a lot of missions you can do if whether you're 20 and I'm level 130 it doesn't matter for a lot of the missions but yes there's some that you start getting up to the 110 120 plus that are supposed to be an incentive and I agree it's the elite right the elite stuff I think people yeah and then there's like now mega hive and secret lab sorry go ahead",

The enemies just get harder and their shots are like I got to the point playing multiplayer with other people that I could be shot twice and I would die and that's it.

So much [\u00a0__\u00a0] They track like crazy. And then like the other added difficulty is every enemy just has shields now.

You have to beat down this guy and then dodge and hope for the best and not do any of these things that take long animations because if you're in a long animation, you can still be hit. You can still be knocked down. And it's they did not plan out that bridge between getting to the end of the campaign to wanting to really be a highle character. And that's I think what annoys me the most. Especially because so much of the campaign was spent going, \"Yeah, go into multiplayer. Multiplayer is the real thing.

It's like you playing Street Fighter and you don't have Hideoken until you like unlock it and charge it up or whatever. But like you can imagine that'd be a huge problem if you're switching between characters. So right I I had very quick comments for guidance for people out there to keep it simple. No, the game doesn't explain it. But number one, the best thing to do in the game I'm curious if you agree, Greg, or if anybody else, but villain sector. So that is the boss, you know, uh that you actually go to the end of a mission and fight a cool boss and you pick up one a day from these faction vendors. Just",

Just number one, that's all you want to do because it's the funnest thing to do by like a long shot, I think. I mean, number one, if you didn't know what to do, definitely hit up your shield and anthill vendor guys to get not only the villain sectors, but then the daily objectives, because that's the thing that's grinding out XP and stuff. I now realize I have done one of these and I did it with AI and the AI like it was against Abomination who had like a field around him that does damage. The AI just like stood around him and then died. I was like great. It's so AI is you know what's interesting too is the AI is based on your characters which is so it's your fault Iron.

And yeah, the game doesn't quite guide you, but that is the most rewarding thing to do in my opinion. It also rewards you some of the best stuff. But I just like go to the end of the mission and fight something. And that's the biggest thing this game's missing. You know, a game like Destiny, which actually they're removing some of this now to clean it up, had like whatever 25 strikes as they're called. This is the closest thing to it.

You get two villain sectors a day hopefully. go do those and judge it first on that. And honestly, imagine if the game had 10 of those. Um, I think it'd be cool, but I also just Oh, 100%. Sorry.

The two villains are Abomination and Taskmaster and then two giant robot things that you can fight, right? So, it's like they're both in the first hour. Yeah. And so like yeah, it's it's fun and it's cool or whatever, but it's also like lame that I've now fought Abomination seven times or whatever it is like that that's the downside to it.

If you're playing as well, blessing and Iran, also do look in your objectives, your um left tab mo, your leftmost tab, and actually just follow those main missions.

You're in the squishy middle game where you just level up your blues and greens, the purples, and all the stats like overall are kind of throwaway. They suck.

So, now I'm just grinding waiting for that to happen. And my point here is like I don't know what the endgame looks like. I was talking to Greg about getting into this fourplayer. I think it's effectively a raid, the secret lab. Uh we know that it'll have a strategic takedown. You have to work together for a big boss.

And I want to get into the whole glitch and uh readiness of the game conversation, but to me, I'm not even in endgame. I don't know too many people that have gotten exotic drops. And no, nobody is in the end game in my opinion. You can't even play the raid yet. The secret lab until you do that and determine how fun that is. Because that is the reason that we might be able to turn around Blessing and Immran Greg and say, \"Dude, you got to play with us.\" And they're like, \"Let's do it.\" And I'm like, \"What level are you?\" And we might find out.

It's it's more the thing of I'm have to be I wonder how many things are going to be gated like that where I don't expect there to be a ton. I think the game knows what it's doing in terms of approachability and keeping people in because it is the same thing of like last night, you know, me gold farm is a little bit ahead of me. So, I think he's 142 or 143 to my 141, which doesn't sound like a lot, but that is hours of work grinding out resources to then get those little points up there.

Uh Destiny has something like that called a dungeon and it's a mini raid effectively and then they literally describe it as the all you know the elements of a raid but for a smaller team easier to get in and out of. So maybe that is what the secret lab is. Um but regardless, yeah, I expect exactly what Greg said. In fact, you pretty much nailed it. I guarantee it might have whatever. You open it up.

I feel like it it lit up on the gas a bit. It started off so strong like when you first meet Camala and her dad and you get into Aday and you do all that stuff. remember during the beta, I was not blown away by the Aday scene. I thought it was fine, especially as it as it worked as a tutorial. I didn't think it was good. Um, playing it in context uh to what's going on in the proper game.

You want to be able to go to different places and do different things and see how stuff but you want balanced characters and you want to feel like in other words I don't want to get a character and find out a different character is way better now and you should honestly just",

That that's where I get into like yeah it would bother me. I'd be like, but what if you felt that charact but what if you felt that and it was like how Destiny does it where it's like all right cool a year from now they've dropped over 15 characters or whatever they drop somebody else new and it's like we've obviously heard you and I don't even think it'll take this long but we've heard you we're also giving away a token that you can use to get your character to 50 level 150 and then start building from there kind of no that's fine that's just leveling them up I mean balancing them out you know like meaning even now I'm trying to figure out who is the best endgame character and that naturally happens but in other words How do you balance out 25 characters? To be fair, maybe",

To be fair, maybe they'll be fine with it. It is it is a little different, you know, like see, I think you don't have to worry about balancing as much if you're not doing PvP like Bus was talking about if it's PvE and it's when I granted I know there was some PvP in it, but Marvel Heroes, right, was a game from Gazillion that was Diablo with Marvel Heroes and I [\u00a0__\u00a0] loved it and it was just clicking and getting [\u00a0__\u00a0] and putting on new armor and being more powerful, but it was that thing of they just kept dropping heroes on you and there was so many hero. Same with Ultimate Alliance to an extent, right? I'm sure that like well yeah Mis Marvel right in Ultimate Alliance 3 launch was like super OP for the challenger rooms it's how I leveled everybody up like if it's just that kind of stuff. Yeah, you make a",

Yeah, you make a good point without PvP it eases things up that if whatever we find out like dude you really should just level up Thor because it's insane and I want to play as Thor, but uh you know it's not the end of the world. I guess we'll see how that pans out. Yeah, cuz like it's at the end of the day you can just spend the time and level them up. I got one question here about PvP and scrolls. believe it or not, but I'm going to save it here for the post show. Uh, before we sign off, gentlemen, do you have anything to say else to say that we haven't covered in this year Marvel update, spoiler cast, whatever you want to call it. I like fine. Aggressively fine. Okay. Yeah. I like when Modoc uh choked Abomination with his claw thing. Yeah. I thought that was really cool. I like his speech there, too. Oh,",

That's a pretty good synopsis. Yeah, I think I I love the performances in here, you know? I mean, regardless of how many plot holes there are and we're going like, \"Wait, what's going on?\" Like, I thought Modoc did a great job. I thought the the Avengers did a great job. Like, I really enjoyed it from a character, you know, standpoint like that. And in general, obviously, I can't stop playing the [\u00a0__\u00a0] game. So, there's something there for sure.
