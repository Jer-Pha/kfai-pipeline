X yeah mr. X I thought was super terrifying I thought he was the most terrifying thing in that game and so if nemesis is supposed to operate like a super mr.

X with weapons mm-hmm I'm into it was like was he wandering in that trailer or was where that was all like preset fights interesting a lot of that looks preset yeah because a lot of that didn't look like the more open areas where you actually wanted to rather look very like you're in the hallways and stuff I do wonder does he follow you around in this game are they doing mr. X like and if he does like does he burst through walls is he like sniping at you with a rocket launcher from somewhere is he just generally being a dick to you in a way mr. X could knock because he didn't have weapons yeah yeah interesting wanted to being a dick with me or something go explore mr.
