            "text": "i played four hours of the new saints row at an event they threw out in vegas so i'm here to answer the question all of you had on your minds is it good simply put yes if you're a fan of saints row and have enjoyed the games in the past this is the saints row you know and love the goofy writing and the over-the-top action sequences are here it feels juvenile at times but at the same time this is a more grounded saints row no super powered presidents and alien invasions this is more akin to saints row 3 in a new setting with brand new characters a new setting is great the city and environments look pretty great i wish i could say the same thing for character models and animation though nothing looks ugly but this game is definitely straddling double a and aaa in some of its budget to make up for it though in fun gameplay your arsenal of abilities is expanded and enemies are a bit better balanced this time around making shooting feel great driving is made more fun with a new side swiping",
