            "text": "young souls is a stylish story-driven beat-em-up with thoughtful combat witty dialogue and engaging rpg elements swap between siblings mid-combat to get an edge on your opponent head out to shops to buy helpful items or to upgrade that new weapon you just earned if you're the type of gamer that backs way at the mere mention of the word souls in gaming fear not this is not a souls-like game sure it's got a parry mechanic but not only does it have four difficulty settings it's got plenty of other accessibility options to help tailor your experience the game released last year on stadia but we know that doesn't really count this year was made available on playstation pc switch and xbox if you're like me and you've been wanting more of an evolution to this classic genre look no further",
