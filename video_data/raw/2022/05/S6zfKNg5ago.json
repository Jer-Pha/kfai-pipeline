            "text": "I have seen Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and I can't wait to see it again for better or worse this is a Sam Ry ass movie pushing the MCU way further into campy horror than anyone would have ever thought would be allowed the antagonist feels more like a Michael Myers or a Jason Vorhees than a supervillain and it really really works I'm shocked at how creatively they push the PG-13 limit with many elements of this film The surprisingly restrained plot skillfully keeps the focus on strange and Wanda and while there's plenty of fan service all of it has context and purpose besides just making an audience emote but I'm telling you right now this movie is going to make audiences emote in ways no Marvel film has ever even flirted with Danny Elfman score is fantastic and is almost Looney Tunes esque in how it weaves and interacts with the onscreen action one music H in particular is just for our full spoiler-free thoughts you can check out the kind of funny screencast right now",
