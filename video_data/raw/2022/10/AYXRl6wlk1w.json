            "text": "It's kind of funny, isn't it? To think that it all started in such a small place, and to think that we've come this far from there. The infinite possibilities are there, with the support of four friends and thousands of people. We've managed to get by, especially over the past few years. But there 's nothing like the magic of the chemical reaction that's created when everyone gathers in the same place. Even if it was just a small room big enough to fit this table in. But what if it wasn't? What if it was a room big enough to fit all of their dreams? Sometimes you have to go back to the past to live in the future. Welcome.
