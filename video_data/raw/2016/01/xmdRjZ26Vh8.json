Here's his here's a fuller quote when asked if PS VR is Rift's biggest competitor. Quote, That might be true. I think that there's not many people who already own a PS4 who don't own a gaming PC who are going to go out and make that roughly fifteen hundred dollar all an investment in the rift. And when he says that, by the way, the all in investment includes the PC, which they're not obviously something. It really is a separate market.

In addition, he noted that he knew Sony was working on VR, VR even before Oculus Rift's 2012 Kickstarter campaign as Sony sent engineers to check out the rift at an early point. So Sony, to their credit, I mean, not that you like pull PS VR out of your asshole, but it's similar to PlayStation Move.

And he said three fifty ish or something. And I think that he misspoke and, you know, that caused a lot of drama and obviously. And obviously Oculus knew that that was gonna be a problem because they didn't even announce the fucking price until they put their preorders up. So they knew that there's gonna be PR problems with that. The second thing.

And that might make them really nervous because because that seems reasonable to me, I really believe in my heart that the one solid truth about VR is this without onboard processing.

And I'm sorry, you know, Oculus isn't twice as good as PSVR. It might be a little bit better, but I'm not sure that that's going to be even a demonstrable sort of thing until you get great high end games that come out later.

I'll tell you, speaking of problems, I'm playing volume on Vita and the trophies don't pop. That's weird. I was telling you the only issue I had with volume on Vita is that it's one of those games that makes you quit out of volume to look at the trophies. I've seen that with other games and that's weird.

I think the biggest triumph of twenty sixteen is going to be the PlayStation four, which is a cop out answer, but I think it's going to continue to sell incredibly well.

There's no way last guardian lives up to its expectations. No, there's no way. That's that's why I said we don't know the state of the game, what the game was and when they rebuilt it basically. But if I was Shuhei at that point, two thousand team equal collection, it was the harbinger of when the game was supposed to come out. I mean, that's obvious.

You know, that's the third time I talk about pulling something out of someone's ass in this show, which is a weird thing. It's a weird thing to keep saying something I'm going to say, though. OK. And my inclination at that point was like, if the game if they could play the game front to back, which you assume that the game was done in some respect, I'm not saying done ready for go, but maybe an alpha. And they were like, it's not very good. I would have been like, just fucking finish the game. And like at some point, I would like just finish the game. We'll take our sixes.

But I do think we're talking about back then that PlayStation is like, yeah, fuck it. Like, we'll take it on the chin. We'll lose all this money. This game sucks. You know what I mean?

But I mean, Sony's got, but you think of it the other way. Sony's looking at their numbers. They're looking at the PlayStation sales and they're saying, well, we thought we couldn't move the order and we did, and we thought we couldn't move on chart and we did, and we didn't see losses about it.

I remember that there's also a sequel like didn't pan out. All right, yeah, no, didn't remember that game. When Vikings attack. How can I forget when Vikings attack?

Yeah, well, yeah, but they really were going all in. Oh, sure. Yeah. By the way, I don't think it was in the news, but I don't think they've announced anything about it.

Here's the thing. What's the last time they really something that wasn't fantastic. It could be garbage and you're going to love it. So whatever you call me a house mark fan boy, I am. Mckayle and Tommaso, my dudes. Yeah, I know. Oh yeah. I was in their 20th anniversary video. I know. So there that's how much you trust this opinion. And I have the best mmo of all time.

I'll tell you right now, I'm getting kind of tired of this segment just being things that have been seen. If it stops using rocket league, too, because a lot of those names can be whatever they want on PC in this. If in the next two weeks we don't get an influx of my name sucks because of X, Y and Z, I'm going to eliminate the segment. Damn. OK, just letting you know unilateral decision. Exactly.

Now there are several interesting points about this first, Blumpkins are hilarious. Second, the fact that he has an underscore and a one at the end of his name suggests that there is at least one other lover of Blumpkins on PSN. Third, I do not think that he would change his PSN name even if Shuhei Yoshida would let him based on his intense use of the term pussies in chat.
