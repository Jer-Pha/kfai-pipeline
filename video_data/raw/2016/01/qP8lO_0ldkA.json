He hosted Reading Rainbow. You crushed it. Thanks. So, this is how this works, guys. As always, I'm not that informed, so I'm not sure about the rules of this, but I watched I watched a video and I'm like, I think I get the gist of this. So, it's essentially the game of telephone that you would play when you were a young, but instead of of, you know, the whispering to people and everyone messing it up cuz they're [\u00a0__\u00a0] right? Instead, y'all three are going to listen to some loud music. Gotcha. The the music of choice here is Blunt Blowing by Little Wayne. Mhm. From the carnivore. Sure. And um you're going to play it loud. So, you can't hear anything except this music",

You guys are going to be like looking away to do your own thing. I'm going to look at Nick and you're going to say and I'm going to say the sentence to him, but I'm still listening to Blum Blow. Yes. And then you're going to repeat the sentence back to me. Okay. All right. And you're going to say yes or no or you No. I'm just going to count.

Wait, we're working backwards where Colin then says it back to me. A different word, different sentence. Do we ever get to figure out how how badly we screwed up the first word?
