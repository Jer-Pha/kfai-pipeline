Yeah, I I think that I'm going to when we start talking about it in a spoiler fashion, I'm going to skew and sound negative, but no, it's a I agree with you. It's a good maybe great game. Beautiful. I I the puzzles I thought were really good.

And I in a positive light in the sense that Limbo had a couple uh for those that don't know, this is the Play Dead. Same people that made Limbo made this very similar games um both in kind of tone look even look and gameplay and feel. This is a much faster uh game. And I I appreciate that the puzzles are not as frustrating as Limbo. Not that Limbo was that hard. No, but I was thinking the same thing where I was waiting for the moment like I remember limbo where I was talking about this on Kong live where you're running down one roof and there's some of like letters like spelling out a hotel name or whatever and like one's broken and I remember that puzzle for some reason",

Yes. And those are those are great. Um and Limbo is amazing at it. I think this game is even better in that it never pushes you too hard. And it's designed to be a short experience. It's designed to keep you moving. And I like that they didn't make things too challenging or to take too long or have too many steps. Like each room is pretty, you know, do this, then do this, then do this, then do this, then you're done. It's not like these 15 step crazy things.

And I didn't think to anytime you if you get to a place where like what do you do? Think of what you've done before.

But take the, you know, the rules or the equations you've learned before and apply them here. Yeah. Um I I definitely think that the the puzzle design was great. I thought the gameplay was really solid and like I to say that it's good is actually really under selling this game. I think that it is a great game. Um somewhere even close to fantastic game. Um I wouldn't give it a 10. I know a lot of people and see this is my problem and this is not spoilery or whatever and maybe it'll help you actually is my problem with it is that I got hyped for it based on the fact 10 out of 10 game of the year.

I I thought Limbo was a great game, especially from a studio we'd never heard of that was like, you know, at the independent booth that one year at GDC. So to sit down with this and go, it was like, oh man, ary cool and wow, it's beautiful and I do like this and what is like playing in the beginning, I'm like, what is going on? And I start you start making up in your head. It's like, oh, maybe I'm doing this, maybe I'm that, and maybe I'm okay, okay, maybe I'm running from these kind of people.

Like cuz it was just, we'll get into spoilers about it, but like for me, and this and this is going to speak to who I am, and it won't be the way you think it is, but stick with me, right? The fact that somebody would say this is game of the year, I scoff and I say there's no way this is a better game than Uncharted 4. And I know the haters want to say, \"Oh, well, of course Uncharted 4 is a PlayStation exclusive. He's a PlayStation fanboy.\" That's the argument. My argument here is that uh uh inside great gameplay, beautiful, uh good puzzles. I feel like it fails at storytelling, and I love Uncharted story, and that's what I go into a game for. Gameplay alone isn't enough. Colin's always # gameplay is king, right? But I won't touch a Mega Man game with a 10-ft pole. I respect what it is and why it's great, but",

And so like when we get into spoilers, we'll go into the thing and I went and there's a secret ending and I went and watched all that and I watched like a 9minute YouTube video from some guy explaining out all these theories and I was just like made me work too hard for it and I don't think anyone's nailed it and I don't think it's that interesting. Interesting. So that for me that and that's just that's why it's what I think it'll come down to for a lot of people. It's I agree. It's a It's a It probably is a great game.

The entire game you're seeing people in line and even the sections you have to actually get in line and do the the things and you're all you're doing is trying to avoid doing that.

What's the debate is if they did something wrong, if they did something right, where they all feel, how we feel about them. Is that the big debate? I guess so. I mean, just for for those that don't know, bring everybody up to speed, Timmy. Yeah. I'm I'm going to read IGN's article. Who wrote it?",

CSGO Lotto, like many Counter-Strike betting sites, lets players wager weapon skins they have won in the game's loot crates. Counter-Strike skins can be valued at thousands of dollars, making this a potentially very lucrative or costly practice. One of Martin's videos shows him winning approximately $13,000 worth of skins. H3H3's video includes clips that show both Martin and Castle using the site. One clip of Martin shows him discussing CSGO Lotto saying, quote, \"We found this new site. I ended up following them on Twitter and stuff and they hit me up and they're talking to me about potentially like a skin sponsorship.\" The video goes on to show another YouTuber, Scarce Scarce, reporting that uh Martin has previously claimed that he originally used CSGO Lotto in the video as a way to decide whether to invest in the company.

I mean, the gut reaction, right, is that it's a shitty thing. Like this is the you know, I always go back to with us where we left, we founded this business, and we never thought to like what are what's our policy on anything? And then it was on that first colony rag live, right? We announced it, you know, at 9:00 a.m. and then we were live at 11:00. And one of the questions for Colin and I that day was like, \"What's your ethics policy?\" And we were like, we we didn't look at each other. We're just like, \"Let's just tell you, you know what I mean? When something sponsored, you'll know. When Square Enix sends us somewhere, you'll know.\" Like, \"We have nothing to hide. We",

Like why why not just say that you own it that hey we're we're starting this and we're doing this and this is how it works. I mean I think that's what they did is even a step like further than even rationally allowed in any way because if they just didn't say that they were sponsored and didn't say that they owned it, that's one thing.

You know on game over Gregory this week we talk about uh police brutality and all this different stuff and like how talking about it helps but is that enough anymore and it's so so crazy and stressful right now as we still write the rules and all these different things about YouTube. I feel like this is a good example of like okay cool and now they're a huge huge channel right lot tons and tons of subs. You see that now as that starts to spread out. You see our message spread out.

Sean Finnegan here here we are talking about it. I know it's shocking. Um, but it it's crazy to me that seeing that on IGN, seeing multiple reports and updates on an IGN because it's just so outside of their that's a Kotaku thing for sure.

And they recently got sued for copyright stuff. Do do you guys know what I'm talking about here? No. The they got really hit with a big a big case and all the YouTubers kind of like rallied against it whether or not they like H3H3 Productions. Like, no, no, no. You can't you can't just [\u00a0__\u00a0] say it's copyright and just because you don't like what he's doing.

Well, I mean, it's a story that needs to be told though, right? I think I feel like as again as these rules are written, as YouTubers rise in popularity, like even the fact that now if you're going to put an ad on, if you're going to something sponsored on Twitter and you put it out, you have to put hashtag ad, like these are the steps showing you what's happening because it does reflect poorly on IGN and when we were there, right, of like we publish a review and if we like it or hate it, it doesn't matter if",

That's not how it work.\" But then you get to YouTube, you get to us where it's the complete opposite where you and I are talking on the phone all the time or you all the time are talking about brand deals and this that and the other and occasionally I do something where I'm planning like our Comic-Con trip and so companies are chipping in to send us there if we're hosting their panels and doing all this different stuff and like so that immediately has to become that when okay cool like you know Square Enix is sending us",

Thank you very much Tim. You're welcome. We covered Ubisoft's conference right here. We're very critical of it. All these different things. Then we went to the Ubisoft booth saw a bunch of games did a bunch of reacts but two of them were sponsored by Ubisoft. So they begin with us saying this is brought to you by Ubisoft.

They understand that we'll tell them those deals and that the deal wouldn't influence it one way or the other. I think the other thing too that a lot of the people out there might not know is that at least as far as I'm concerned, most of the people we deal with, I'd say 99% of the the companies we've dealt with, clients we've dealt with, uh whether it's game developers or otherwise, um they're on our side too",

And every year they'd come out with surprises and like lineups that were like legendary for the time. Like when coming out in time on Metroid Prime it's like get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of here.

Um, showing that was the beginning of the end of Nintendo's conferences being a joke, like being super bad. And that was, I'd say, right when Microsoft and Sony were still having shitty conferences, but they at least weren't that bad. You know, it wasn't like the joke of the show. Uh, and then it wasn't until a couple years later, like 2012, that Sony and Microsoft got good, specifically Microsoft, and they kept going. But then Sony's like, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] we got to step our game up.\" And now Sony's just top of the game with all that stuff.
