For topic Vader number three, unsurprisingly, I want to talk about Nintendo. Nintendo movie plans. Oh god, things are things are happening. Things are a brew over in Nintendo land. Over at IGN, Alex Osborne writes, \"Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima confirmed the company has plans to produce feature films and is exploring a production system in which we can do as much as we can ourselves.\" Kimishima did not give a specific time frame as to when the company plans to release its first movie, only saying, quote, \"The first title won't",

He also noted that Nintendo isn't interested in producing live-action movies with Kimishima citing the 1993 Super Mario Brothers film as the main reason why the company's leaning towards anime type content when Nintendo should produce as much by itself as possible in instead. With regard to which Nintendo franchise may be adapted, he refused to specify. This isn't the first time Nintendo's expressed interest in the movie business. Last year, Miiamoto said the company's open to movie adaptations based on its stable beloved characters. In fact, legendary game designer released a batch of Pikmin short films in 2014, the same year during all those Sony leaks. Uh, a hack revealed that Spider-Man producer Avi Arod was in negotiations",

Um, and then last year there was those Netflix rumors about the Zelda series that not panning out. What do you think? Good luck. I don't know. It's it's are they my concern is are they all going to be like direct to DVD movies? Are they going to be real movies that come to a theater or are they going to be Netflix projects which would be cool to there's a bunch of cool ways to do it but there's so many different ways for it to go wrong.

Like they talk about, you know, anime style, right? Like Legend of Zelda anime would be awesome if you if done right. But then just a CG movie of Legend of Zelda in the theaters would be [\u00a0__\u00a0] rad too and it would set the world on fire if you gave it the real promotional push and the right writers and the right director. And you know, it's it's similar what we're talking about with Disney and like how they're partnering with the best people for the best IPs. If Nintendo was like, \"All right, cool.

I think that what they're talking about is not necessarily doing the movie stuff, but it's more about the writing and the the characters and the story and all of that stuff. Like recently, they did the in the launch for Star Fox Zero, one of the few good things about that game was the anime that came with it. It was [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome.

They had it planned out and I imagine that this is what they're talking about. Like they're not talking about, hey, we make video games now. We're making movies. I think it's more like, you know, they would be producing the project, commissioning out other people that have the the skills and resources to do it. I know the anime the Star Fox one was made by like real anime houses that work like Bleach Naruto and all that stuff. Um, and I I really loved that. I thought it was amazing.

And uh this the anime is like really one of those things where I'm like, man, I never thought that I' I'd see this type of thing. And I think that now we're finally at a place where media is is so making videos isn't a big deal. You know, we're almost at a point that making movies isn't a big deal. Like, people can just do it. Like, we could make a movie right now if we wanted to with a camera would be good. Oh, it would be good. But whatever. You know, a couple years ago, we couldn't do that. Colin does Dallas.

Whatever. The distribution it it gets weird. So, when you say the real movie or direct to DVD, direct to DVD at this point is even more of an insult than it used to be. Yeah, it is. And that's what I I just don't want Aladdin 4 or Jafar Needs Glasses. I want like a real goddamn movie. Okay, first off, do not talk [\u00a0__\u00a0] about Return of the Jafar or King of Thieves. Both [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome movies. There's no Aladdin 4. If there was, I'm sure it would be horrible, but two and three were dope as [\u00a0__\u00a0] Um, but I think that when Nintendo, it's like, yeah, if they did direct to DVD, that would be an issue.

Um and it seems that it's awesome but it missed the mark of the game of what made the game special. It's like it didn't from I didn't see it but from reading the reviews it seems like it didn't kind of use any of the inventive weapons or kind of really hit on that level of the that's a big part of the game. What is Ratchet? Yeah. What is Ratchet and Clank? and they they missed the the mark on that. Um, I think that it's a little bit easier to to nail that with Mario and stuff because I feel like Mario is a little simpler than Ratchet and Clank in that regard.

There's not a lot of, you know, depth to them when you play these games, right? that it is like, \"Oh, hey, Mario. I'm making you a cake. Come over.\" And then she gets kidnapped and we go through all these worlds, right? But there's potential there. But I worry if Nintendo's there holding on too tight, do we ever get that potential where we're getting into who Mario is and all this stuff? They're like, \"Well, no, we don't need to know that. Just get him out there. Bowser's made this [\u00a0__\u00a0] thing, a floating castle.\" But I think that's where it's at, though.

I think the Mario game it needs to be simple. Well, it needs to be it's a kid movie, you know? It's like that movie I that needs to make a lot of money so that they can then make the the Zeldas or the Metroids or whatever. I honestly I think that the the best foot forward would to be to make the Nintendo movie. Yeah, I totally agree with you. Make the Lego movie of Nintendo kind of crossover that's going to end Nintendo is Sonic. Sonic is there. Call it Smash Bros. But it's Smash Bros. it's all the character like if they just did the plot of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the single player campaign um and made that into a thing.

Just don't ruin the trailer cuz everybody act like that was going to be a big reveal that the good guys were going to get together at the end. I think that I mean I'm a little more bullish about this thing, Greg. I think this is like an obvious win for them and it's shocking that they really I mean I know that they really got burned with the Mario game movie like you know a long time ago and and that they've been like really quite siloed away from kind of the realities of entertainment and they've been very prideful and they've been very insular with their IP.

And what would even be more interesting is if they really got in a bed with Pixar or they really got in a bed with DreamWorks or one of these big studios and was like, \"You guys do it and we'll we'll license it and we'll we'll we'll greenlight it.\" But like a studio that has talent that's going to it's going to be published by Disney or something like that and you have um a whole marketing arm, a whole marketing empire kind of behind it. I think that that movie can't lose. Even if it's bad, I don't think that that like a Mario movie like that can lose. I don't think they'll do that is my thing.

I don't know if it's fast enough. I don't know if it's too late, but I really think that it's ch they're changing. the smartphone games is a really great sign that um while they're not for me and I don't give a flying [\u00a0__\u00a0] about these games like Mitomo, a lot of people do and this is probably the direction they need to go in especially for the native market in Japan.

Yeah, it could could be someone like that. Hopefully not. But but so to me, it's like I would love to see them do something bold like that because I think everyone kind of defaults to like, well, Mario and Pokemon. And I'm like, well, all right, those make sense. You can even do something with Donkey Kong, you do something Kirby. It doesn't matter. Like those are cartoons.

So, it should be a big deal. It must sell millions and millions and millions of copies. And it doesn't sells fine, does well. We're all excited about it. We love Zelda. But I think that could be the one where it could be the you get that in front of people and like the people who had no idea what Lord of the Rings were before Lord of the Rings came out. You could see people going like that trailer looks awesome and he's fighting that oneeyed spider and this is happening and he's [\u00a0__\u00a0] knocking lightning bolts or whatever back at this redheaded dude.

And I think the exciting thing about Metroid, what I really want to see them do with Metroid, and that's why I'm confident Metroid is in an X launch title as well, is that they kind of probably realize that I mean, you want to talk about Zelda not selling great. I mean, a good example is like Skyward Sword was out sold by Uncharted 3, which was to me was like unbelievable considering the install base, considering the residents of of Zelda, considering that we hadn't, you know, people were not too happy with Twilight Princess, but it seemed like Skyward Sword just like didn't really do it.

I think Metroid's the one where they can make a serious good movie and they can really reap benefits from it that will reach back into their catalog and allow people to play those games again and and and realize that those games are great and let them kind of, you know, let Retro or another studio kind of run with the series and tell us and and give us a different look at Nintendo, something that's dark and serious.

And then but so like when that comes out, it's just like that's not doing anything to push it forward. Whereas I think a Zelda movie can go both ways. It can it does expand out. You've seen the one IG put up the fake trailer for the Zelda movie like the way everyone freak the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out. That would still be there. Yeah, but I think and I I totally agree with you.

If you look at it now, I mean it's it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] It's really like it it looks it's what as excited as you were back then, it was more of the idea, right? And back then it was novel and fresh and that was crazy. But now it's like oh god this is really rough. Uh you saying Pokemon I don't even know why. Like I didn't even that didn't come to mind. Like the Pokemon movies it's different because Pokemon is a cartoon you know already and like those movies were I don't look at them as video game movies. They're they're cartoon movies. You know what I mean? Sure. That was just my example of the really the only time since Captain N where they which was like what I grew up with where they were like let's just [\u00a0__\u00a0] do it you know like like everything like cuz you know you were younger maybe not even born but like there was a Nintendo at one time",

And um Pokemon to me like from like 98.99 till like the early 2000s. That was an example to me. I I remember I had my Team Rocket action figures just on my computer monitor and I was like this is I would never be able to even get my hands on something like this unless I went to Japan unless I I went to like like specialty shops or got my Funko Pop whatever like whatever it is.

Like there's there's like it's surprising to me that there's so much Diddy Kong action figures and Samus and Link. Yeah, I know, right? But I mean it's it's pretty it's way more sucks. Can we just say it? Way more expensive than I thought. Like there's Star Fox and stuff like Oh, that's pretty cool. Yeah, I didn't know that.

They're done in that respect. like they're not going to be this powerhouse of 50 million, 70 million, 80 million, 100 million selling consoles. It's not going to happen anymore. So, you need to you need to figure out ways to like leverage those things.

Like why didn't they like become this ubiquitous thing? like they just let it go and I don't and it's just kind of it's kind of crazy how this company really like the like the QC score kind of aspect of this company has changed so much I think in a in a way Mario and and they just kind of like threw it away and uh they the thing is that they have this IP and they're always going to have it and so they should leverage it in as many ways as possible and I think",

And um I think that um allowing them to do secondary and tertiary moves like making a Metroid movie and taking risks. Um because I'll tell you right now with all these people that are talking about how much money they have, they can't take too many risks. They if they start dumping money into these projects and they fail, they're going to have no money. So I don't know. It'll be interesting to see how it all pans out for them. I'm rooting for them.

I I wish that Pixar would be involved. They're not going anywhere and Disney's not going to be involved. They have too much [\u00a0__\u00a0] going on. They have to make their own movies. DreamWorks, absolutely. I think this is something that would be right up their their alley. There's a whole bunch of other smaller um Jack Black is Mario. I mean, absolutely, though. I mean, that's I can totally see that type of [\u00a0__\u00a0] happening. And again, like it's not like I'm looking forward to the Mario movie. Like that is going to be the kids thing.

Um Pok\u00e9mon, even if they did a Pokemon movie that wasn't related to the the cartoon, I think that could obviously kill. I think that is the easiest win for them besides just Nintendo straight up. Mario's going to perform super well. I think Zelda is the next choice after that. I love the idea of a Nintendo cinematic universe that uh I actually think would work with DC's planning but in a way that DC's I don't think is kind of working out where if they started with the everyone's here and then kind of splinter out but splinter out in a way that they're not splintering out to then reeee up again.

Like, we can see these things that should clash somehow not clash because they're Nintendo. That's something unique to Nintendo and Disney. I can't think of many more other people like that. So I I'm excited by this, but it's the same type of thing where I'm like I remember when we heard about Crazy Taxi movies, that never happened.

So it's like unless they are super high budget and even then then we're getting Transformers, you know?
