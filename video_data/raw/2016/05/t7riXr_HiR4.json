Topic four, as always, brought to you by the kind of funny forums. to kind of funny.com/gamescast topic just like my dude Fallon Zion did. Hello to the host with the most and the two best dudes in video games. I recently picked up Dark Souls II after putting 5 hours into the game. I'm simply not into it. I find this odd because I thoroughly enjoyed Bloodborne, but Dark Souls is just not doing it for me. Some would say to give the game some time and to get let it get its hooks into you, but I wonder how long that amount of time should be. My question is, how much time should you give a game before walking away? I think five hours is even too long. Yeah, it's as much as you put into it, how much you want to put into it. Is it not working for you? It's not working for you. Yeah, it's not a huge surprise. What I heard for about Dark Souls 3I was that it is a",

What I heard for about Dark Souls 3I was that it is a little faster and a little more arcade. It might have taken a page from Bloodborne, but um and I like Bloodborne way more than I like Demon Souls or Dark Souls. I didn't play Dark Souls 2 and I didn't play three as I just said. So, but I think that you if like it's your time, man. Time's precious. You don't have nothing to prove to anyone. 5 hours is a lot of time. Like if the game's not connected with you, sell it back or return it and [\u00a0__\u00a0] play something else. There's no shame in that. Dark Soul, I've said it before and I hate to say it again, but Dark Souls fans are so [\u00a0__\u00a0] pretentious.

And I think he's probably one of those people. So I don't think there's any shame in that at games are diverse enough that you can't just say I like games and that's the end of it and you like every game that everybody likes. That's not how it works. You like different genres, you like different gameplay styles, you have to worry about it. Yeah. And it's interesting too cuz Dark Souls 3 and I feel like the dark the the Souls franchise has only gotten like broader and broader where so many people love it so much and uh I mean I just I haven't even really given it a all but I just I can tell it's not for me.

It's more case by case, game by game. Um, obviously I think RPGs take a bit longer to get into. Like story based things, you got to give it the time to get hooked on the story. You need that first act. I think at least whatever that means, whether it's an hour or five hours or 10 hours, like you got to get past that point. Um, but if it's really not hooking you, hey, no shame in that at all. Lionheart says, \"Hey guys, recently Sony revealed that the PS4 has sold 40 million units, and as usual, Microsoft is so hush- hush about their sales numbers of Xbox. I'm curious what your thoughts are on why that is. I know people who have bought both consoles, but can't find a reason to play their Xbox",

I know people who have bought both consoles, but can't find a reason to play their Xbox and are unable to sell it. Do you think PlayStation has better quality exclusive games than Xbox? And is that the reason why the PS4 is so far ahead? Or is there another reason? It seems to me that games like Uncharted, God, Last of Us, and Ratchet and Clank are way more popular than games like Gears and Halo. Although I must admit that quantum break does look really good. Keep up the good work. A lot of stuff happen in that question. There is. There is. Why do you hide the numbers? Cuz you're losing. And since you don't have to share them, why would you share them? Because then the story just becomes how far behind PlayStation you are. Mhm. Um is it the exclusives? Is that what does it? No, that is not at all.

Just like the PlayStation 3's failure is the Xbox One failure of we got off on the wrong foot. We came out and said all the wrong stuff and we really alienated everybody. And meanwhile, the competition, in this case, PlayStation 4, came out and said, \"We [\u00a0__\u00a0] up last time. We're all about games. It'll be easy to get games on this thing. Let's play games.\" And Microsoft said, \"TV TV, Xbox, Xbox, cable, sports, this, that, but it was like nope. Nobody wanted that. Oh, you can't you have to be online all the time and this that.

I think that I mean we've we've gone over this kind of ad nauseium, but it's it it really shocking how much it doesn't have anything to do with first party games because if it did, Microsoft would be winning cuz uh I think that their output until recently has been better.

It is about the zeitgeist of like rolling the the ball down the hill or the rock down the hill and just watching it accumulate um you know debris as it goes down and like I think that that's what happens. Sony just really lapped Xbox from the very beginning and they've never caught up and the number so Microsoft's numbers are probably between 20 and 25 million which are very respectable numbers but not when you're facing something that's selling 40 million in counting.

So, it's not so much as usual. Microsoft's not releasing their numbers. Just this time they're not. Well, as I think he means I I could be wrong, but I think as usual, meaning this generation like they have not announced numbers, I think in like over two years. Um, so that's that that is extraordinary. There's no reason to, but I think that there they they have to figure out a way to spin it that's respectful to them. I would announce the numbers and be like, look, like we're still trending around Xbox 360, not ahead of Xbox 360. 25 million units is",

That's more than the original Xbox sold. That's more than, you know, that we're creeping on N64. Like, you're talking in terms of how human beings speak to each other when when it's just going to be the Twitter headline. Xbox 50% behind PlayStation 4. You know what I mean? That's why they don't do it. That's that's the optic of it. And I think that, you know, the unfortunate thing for Microsoft is that the United States is their most successful market and they're doing fine here, but um Sony mitigated a lot of struggles in the United States with like a lot of success in emerging markets and a lot of success in Western Europe and in Eastern Europe, a lot of success in Japan obviously.

They were never as soft as they felt because we were really in the place where Sony was getting its ass kicked. But if you were in England or you were in Germany or you were in Japan, the PS3 era was a little bit different and a lot of people didn't play Xbox 360, Xbox 360 crash and burn in Japan, for instance. So Sony's able to spread the ball a little bit and they they did that last generation to keep the it was they were never getting beat by that much. Um and they're pretty much in par about 80 million each now.

Keegan Andrew says, \"Hey gentlemen and Tim.\" Ah, I got you. Yeah. Regarding my Wii U, I have a Wii U and I don't remember the last time I played it. I loved it when I first got it, playing all the hot games like Mario Kart, Captain Toad, and so on. My question is, should I wait to sell it or get rid of it closer to the NX launch? Nope. I know GameStop likes to give extra credit when you trade in a console from old gen or should I get rid of it now? I'm sure I could sell it on Craigslist for more money. Don't sell your hardware.

Having said that, do not sell your Wii U on Craigslist. You're not going to make any money off of that. You'll maybe make like 100 maybe 150. It's not even worth it at that point. Well, you're talking about the GameStop trade in. Absolutely. If you're going to get rid of the console, do that. They give weird ass things where it's just totally worth it.

Bonus trading credit. There's all these like bonuses that if you play it right and you do it the right time, right week, yeah, you can really get a nice deal on upgrading a console and like get half off the console and that that's that's going to be way more more worth it than getting $100 now. I think um but also I do think you should keep the console because don't sell hardware. Don't sell hardware even though I mean there isn't anything coming out for it.

Yeah, I think that I just don't want to underst understate the complete destructive nature of this model on gaming.

It's good for you. It's good for everybody. Release date May 24th, 2016. You can get that on PC or Steam if you are so inclined. Do you think that Roaring Orcs is a play on words like the restaurant Roaring Forks? Probably not. No, you don't think the guy wrote it and he's like, \"Oh, [\u00a0__\u00a0] I ate at Roaring Forks today and then I made a Roaring Orcs tour in my PR press release.\" Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us again on this first and last ever episode 70, the Kind of Funny Games cast. We'll see you next week. Hope to see you at Kind of Funny Live. Till next time, I love you.",
