It's good to be here with you today. It's good to be here with you today as well. Um, what did you play this weekend? What have you embibed in? Uh, not much. You You played a bunch of stuff. Uh, you didn't get deep into stuff, but you played stuff. Yeah. You turned on Shadow the Beast for 30 minutes 30 seconds. Uh, no. I I uh I beat Shadow Complex 100% of that on PS4. How was it? How did it hold up? How everything? Yeah. The story is a little ridiculous, but yes, sure. But that's video games, but I mean like Well, no, not necessarily. There's a lot of ridiculous stories in video games. Sure, but not always. Yeah, I would think the majority though. Sure. But this is uh this game has potential to have a cool story, but that's not why you're playing it. Sure. So, very well designed. Is the story not good or is it just crazy and loony?",

Uh and then I played Doom for a few hours and I I really like it. Yeah. Um you going to get back to it? Yeah. No, definitely. I'll definitely get back to it. Um, and then uh I played Home Front, but very briefly, like an hour. Is Home Front out or do we have that super early? Homer's out this week. Okay. Okay. So, by the time this post exactly, um, doesn't run that well. Yeah. I didn't notice I didn't notice any technical hitches in it when I was playing, but I mean, I played really only through the tutorial, so I wasn't really like in the open world or anything, right?

I mean that's the diff that's what's so [\u00a0__\u00a0] stupid about this is that so we we talked about Red Dawn the remake which was supposed to be about China.

Now it's Metacritic's more like a six or a six and a half maybe maybe around there maybe even a seven but um probably lower than in the sixes. Uh but I always felt like this game wasn't going to be very good because Sony just hit it for so long. Yeah, it just came out of nowhere. It was announced before PS4 even came out and uh then just disappeared for almost three years. probably like two years and then they like kind of brought it out of hibernation like it still exists and here's what it looks like and stuff.

Um, this is was predictable and Lego I think is the salvation of this simply because the Lego has more utility than just the on like the iname. This is what it comes down to, Greg. This isn't a cheap way to play games. And if this is really targeted at children, and it is, then this isn't a sustainable way to play games. Why do I have to buy a $60 game, or maybe more than that to buy the portal and all this kind of stuff, and then I have to buy toys to activate things that are in the game? It doesn't make any sense. when you have these robust experiences that are $60 out of the gate. Like, it's just it's all these extra steps.

So, the capital investment in making these games is high. 300 people lost their jobs at that studio. So, there's a lot of people working on this game. And then there's it's not just the game and making the game. It's making the toys and QAing all that kind of stuff and molding it and finding retail partners and shipping more things. And you have to buy more things to sell more things. And there was one of these stories saying like that they ate like a million Hulk figures because they made too many of them. They anticipated that being super popular and didn't pay. So there's all these ways to [\u00a0__\u00a0] up, right? And that was the thing is that the game from what they were saying was selling well.

Whatever. never doing this again. Yeah. And you just don't hear that about $60 games in a static sort of way. So, I think that the market's kind of catch catching up with this thing.

Talk Speaking of That Last of Us, Benny Blackout wrote in and said, \"Hey, Colin and Greg.\" Hello. With Naughty Dog's tendency to announce their next title relatively soon after their last release, parenthesis, The Last of Us announced a month after Uncharted's release and Uncharted 4 announced within a year of The Last of Us being released and it most likely being a Last of Us sequel that's in the works. I was wondering what you guys thought the game would be called. In my opinion, The Last of Us 2 sounds clunky and redundant. And I can't help think that something like The Rest of Us would work better. And if indeed the series makes it to a trilogy, called Call the finale, The End",
