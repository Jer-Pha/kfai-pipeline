Here is our kind of funny reacts for Death Stranded, the new Cojima game. Oh my god. He came out like a majestic. It was one of those where I got scared. We did the E3 predictions episode of PS I Love You XOXO, which we do these predictions annually, as you know. And I made the prediction that Kajjima would come out and he would show at least concept art, maybe a teaser trailer. And then this morning, the news was like, \"Oh, Kajjima doesn't even have an engine yet.\" And I was like, \"God, no. That's bad.

I was like okay cool and then you see this baby and you're like okay what that's very much very much Kjima. Okay it is that's the PS3 baby. But then this here I was like this body type looks like snake and I was like is he going to do some and then I was like no it's Norman Raidus it's happening and I was like Garo is gonna burst through a wall in a second. I'm like oh my god I'm loving this man. I'm loving the vibes from this whole thing. And I personally I love this type of stuff. Like what do you think is it going to be? I don't know.

There's a lot of weird [\u00a0__\u00a0] going on. Very very Cojima. Yeah, of course. Lot of love there though. But happened to Hideo Kojima at some point and I'd love for him to tell me about it or a therapist somewhere along the line. But I mean, man, this is just interesting looking. You know, I'm sure we're going to get a whole bunch of 15minute long CG trailers and [\u00a0__\u00a0] over the next couple years, but man, no, it was it was, you know, we talked about on PS I love you tonight.

What an unexpected thing. I mean, I called it, but what an unexpected thing of like I called it thinking it wouldn't happen or whatever. But then again here, these five pillars, what's going on?
