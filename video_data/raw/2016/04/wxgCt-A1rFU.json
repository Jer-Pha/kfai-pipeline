I like that it's another Heather Gray shirt but it's a Batman shirt this time. If you open up my closet I have one shirt left with stripes on it and the rest of them are Heather Gray. Fifty shades of Heather Gray. It is. It's weird. There's a lot of different shades of Heather Gray and I have all of them. Over there in another amazing shirt the Pure Wind Tim Gettys. This is what is this one called? That is neon blue. No there was a weird name for it. It was good. It was a good laugh for a while but whatever. I liked this shirt a lot. I liked how Tim looked in that shirt until Kevin Koala. Lean in here and show them everybody. Show them what's up Kev. I hate Kevin so much.

Kevin's 100% wearing this shirt. I'm sure and I walk in and he's just so excited. I'm like I hate everybody so much. Well we had that dialogue back and forth when I had ordered two of these. One for me and you had asked for one and Kevin said he had asked for one and I was like alright well I remember asking for one and saying does anyone want one? One person said yes I want one. Kevin gave me the little pouty eyes and he was like. In a similar cool shirt Colin Moriarty, Pride of Long Island. Go Islanders. That's a Playstation shirt.

Um, but yeah. And then I, you know, 10 years later, um, after not working and auditioning, I zombie came along and then my character, they made a gamer and then all of it just sort of came together.

I was reminded of that when I went and tried to play home front, the revolution this week and they were running on PCs and lo and behold, the PC we selected didn't work. So Kevin and I didn't get any footage and get to play the game. They just brought a fucking PlayStation or I bet you would have worth, but you know, I digress after a couple of gaming, the firmware updates aren't that fucking horrible. You know, they're good.

Do you really credit gaming with being like a, getting you on this path to where you are? You say it starts with super Nintendo. Yeah, I'd say so. I mean, for me, I can't even watch TV or film really. You're on TV. I know it's tough. I don't really watch. I find it, it's too hard for me to engage with. It doesn't keep my attention. I need far more kind of stimulation from, from, from my art. And so for years gaming is the only thing I could do where I'm not falling asleep. You know what I mean?

I think the performances you get, the voice acting there is always stellar. And, and, um, I kind of always thought I zombie would work really well as a telltale game.

That's what happens when you're watching a show that's not about anything, which is why I stopped watching walking dead three or four years ago. But I mean that's for the record.

So it conflicts with, again, so that's why like when we talk about consuming, like your profession and what you enjoy, they can be disjointed because as a viewer, I don't really want to see 22 episodes, 10 seasons of a show. As a, as an actor, I definitely want that. You know what I mean? I mean, it depends on the show. Obviously I vastly had to go back and forth.

And I don't, and I don't, there's probably a lot of actors that don't even watch their own movies. I don't blame them because it's like, it's the way I feel about games. It's like, we do this every day. And so I don't want to live this in this world all the time. Like at all, like I am not even remotely interested in living in the gaming world all day. So it's, it's, I think it's totally healthy for an actor to not",

One of my favorite jobs ever was I was, I think I was 17. I worked at the UK version of GameStop and it was like, you know, you could take games home. What we did was talk about games and sell them and play them. Last thing I wanted to do when I went home was play games. It kind of killed that for me. And that's why I didn't take that job at that strip club as a barman. When anything becomes work, you just lose interest. It's important to diversify. It's hard too.

I mean, there's this weird, like everyone has this weird way of looking at it that, and I don't really understand the ins and outs of it, but once you get to a certain point, it actually makes more financial sense to invest in another season just to keep the syndication going.

And then with the Force Awakens, we've moved away from that style, obviously, because it's much, much later.

There's some, there's some curmudgeon out there that's like, why is this motherfucker always here? But it's like, I'm telling you there's fucking crazy people. There's crazy people out there.

It's the same bag that's used all there. Do you think it's possible that the property manager does think that car is Colonel's car and that he is thus then finding other black bags around the property and assuming this is still those fucking people, I'm going to put it on Colonel's car.

What you do is wait for it to happen again and then smash your own fucking car up, smash your windscreen and leave the dog shit there, vandalize your car, then report to the police, including the dog shit and make it a federal matter. And then the, I fucking like you to smash your car. It would be vandalism for one and two. You can't do that now again.

I got my stuff out of the wrong car and noticed that the correct car was pulling in behind me and then started putting my things into the correct car. And my friend says, what the hell are you doing in that guy's car? I said, nevermind. I'll tell you later. Before we left. I told my friend, I just need to get my license back from the cop parentheses. Mind you, he was watching the entire exchange from the inside. So I go inside until the cop and my friend is here.

It's not like you can just scratch that out. And he's like, but I very seldom show up to court just to let you know. And I'm like, okay, enter or shit. He didn't show up. So I got out of the ticket.

Well, cause I, you know, I think now that I'm thinking about it, I think I had already gotten a ticket and this was the second one.

Cause there is that quid pro quo of you are using your celebrity and we're going to obviously promote the fact, or",

But most people who are at doors for things would recognize people like that's their job, right? Their job is to get people of a certain like level of esteem or, and, or looks inside of a club so that when people get there, they create that sort of like fear of missing out, right? Like, Oh my God, we just saw the entire cast of iZombie walk in there. That's awesome. We have to be in there now. People's texting, tweeting, whatever. Now this club's hot.

Like we, we can touch New York. We can get around the US. Yeah. Like it's just like, we really should probably go to Western Europe. Yeah. We have a significant, just looking at our Patreon numbers and looking at our data, we have a lot of people in Europe and, and like thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of people, like just in London alone, not normally again. And the surrounding areas, nonetheless, if they want to come over from France and",

The service is going to be interesting for you guys. There's no way. There's no way. Where's Nando's? What do they do? It's like McDonald's, but fancy. Okay. So you order at the counter. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Now the cheeky Nando's music video has a waitress that comes over and asks, have you been to Nando's before? To which he responds is, are you, are you buff? Something like that. Are you buff? Are you mad? No, no, no. Buff. Oh my God. But you have someone, you have someone who shows you to your seat. Okay. It's the funny, it's the weirdest thing. So like you walk into Nando's and they go, how many is at your table? With two, three, whatever. They'll take you to your table.",

It's all paid for. Then someone will come over and ask if everything's all right. They don't do anything. They'll just go, you go, yeah. And then they leave. And that's Nando's. Like there's no service. But then again, tipping's weird because they're still doing a job, but you're already paying before the service. That's like Sizzler here. So it sounds like Sizzler. I don't like that shit. And then Carl's Jr. is somewhere weird in the middle. Don't talk shit about Carl's Jr. Well Carl's Jr. is McDonald's. Except they bring the food to you.

I've tipped at McDonald's. Really? What'd they do with it? Where they just like, uh, sir. I fucking love McDonald's. I'm so happy when I get there. I'm always like, if I get everything I want and quick, I'm like, yeah, here's an extra. Have you been to, have you seen the new McDonald's? What they're doing now? We walked into the one over in Stone's town and you walk in and it's just screens. Oh yeah. They had like, this is fucking weird. And I'm like, I was like, at first I'm like, this is a weird, this is what the $15 minimum wage is going to get you by the way. And all these places.

It looks like you just feel like it's like you're facing a wall and you look over and there's a bunch of like touch screens that you can go order off of. And then if you keep walking on the other side of the wall, there's like four registers and it's the standard service. Jack in the box has been doing that for years. Yeah. And it's the cool thing about it is that it allows you to customize in a way that you didn't even know was fucking possible before. Like I'm never going to be the asshole standing at the counter being like, Hey, I'm not Nick. Can I take this thing off? Can I add three of these things? Can I do whatever?
