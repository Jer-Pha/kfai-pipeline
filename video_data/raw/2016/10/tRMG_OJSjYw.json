How long realistically do you think you could stand in front of Greg buck naked before that thing started going down? It's tough.

We went over to our friends Goose's house and Goose is the real president of Team Fat. He was he was the first person to introduce me to Team Fat when we would do uh dodgeball and break into skins versus shirts. Uh shirts team skinny shirtless team fat.

We want to look up to you doing now. Yeah. Oh, okay. There you go. Dead inside. What? What? Not good for Did we cover all the mini topics? Cloning was the other topic. Oh. Oh, yeah. They stem cells and cloning should be totally happening. I mean it is happening. I know, but I mean like we shouldn't be all weird about it. There's a lot of make some hearts lot of restrictions on it though. There are I mean a lot they was I was reading a thing not too long ago that Europe is 10 to 15 years ahead of us in in terms of stem cell research and in terms of core cloning because of our very Byzantine rules in the United States about it.

And as I've said before, pro-life is actually growing. Um, in the internet age, all the other social issues have gone liberal except for pro-life. Mostly because uh you can Google for two seconds and find a bunch of abortion pictures and that really changes people's minds about what what's going on there. Um, and I was pro-life for a long time, but I eventually changed because I was like, it's just not it's not practical with liberty. Exactly.
