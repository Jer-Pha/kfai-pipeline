Kevin, for the last time, please stop trying to combine the dead frog with a Lego Technic set. His name is Daryl. Whatever. All right, kids. Listen. Just put your frogs away. I didn't want to have to do this, but according to the school district, at least 15 minutes of every school year has to be devoted to sex education. Normally, the chemistry teacher, Mr. Smith, handles it, but lucky for him, I have a gambling addiction and I owe him some money. So, we made a compromise and well, here we are. Not that it'll make much difference because I honestly believe none of you listen to a word I say. Wait, is that the TV cart? Are we watching a movie? I hope it's the Spanish version of I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry. The penis enters the vagina slowly as both bodies prepare for orgasm.

An act that will most likely take less than 30 seconds for most meals, thus solidifying deeprooted feelings of inadequacy when talking to the opposite sex. Wow. Wa! Pause. He hold on. Someone really should screen these videos ahead of time. It's like my ex-wife wrote that. Ah, right. I totally forgot. Class, we have a new student. She's a transfer from the East Coast. Give her a good old-fashioned IG North High welcome. Bonjour everyone. My name is Jenvf. I am from Montreal. She has the voice of an angel. I love you. Let's find you a place to sit. Kevin, get up. Get up, Kevin. Kevin, please get up. Get up, Kevin. For the love of God, Kevin, get up. Stop knocking up, Kevin. Kevin, fine. Come on, Daryl. They'll never understand us. We'll make them pay. Uh, Mr. Sera, she can sit here. [Music] I'll take that one. Well, kids, now that you know how disappointing the actual",

Well, kids, now that you know how disappointing the actual act of sex will be for most of you, let's segue over to some of the dangers. You suck. Oh my, Mr. Glad left you. I figured you'd say that. So, I've brought in a special guest here to tell you about the many perils of STDs. Please welcome Bernie the clown. A clown? What is this? Russia, a clown. This is the best day of my life. Hello, children. My name is Bernie the Clown, aka Bernie, aka the clown. As part of my rehabilitation program mandated by the great state of California, I'm here to tell you about STDs. In other words, you're a walking example of what not to do in life. That is incredibly insulting, but also accurate. If we were alone in the hallway, I would shank you in the spleen. Well, looks like you got a handle on this. I'm going to go Irish up a mug in the teacher's lounge. All",

So, I could really use someone to show me around after class. Everything is kind of intimidating, you know. Do you think he's going to make balloon animals? I've always wanted a wiener dog. Is he messing with me? Nobody knows for sure. And then there was the time I robbed a convenience store because I needed money for an HPV vaccine. Got that little gem in Thailand. Now I know why they call it a pingpong show. Am I right? You know what? Are you like 12? Mr. Bernie the Clown, can you do magic tricks? Kid, what do I look like? The Pope. Sweetheart Candy the Monster is back. I love candy. Oh, really? Yeah. Ah, I like candy, too. I like candy and secrets. Hey, you know, I've got some candy",
