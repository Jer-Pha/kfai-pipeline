What are you working on over there? Uh, I'm uh someone gave me a topic suggestion and I want to make sure I can shout that kid out on the Oh, so you're over on kind of funny.com forum. Yeah, we did the AMAs last Friday, not the American Music Awards. We did a ask me anything on uh on our forums and it went really well. I'm glad. Yeah. How long did you guys end up staying? Because I was there for like way longer than I probably should have. People asked me some really good questions. That was like hour and a half. Yeah, I answer all my questions on answer them all. Um anyway, someone uh Well, don't spoil it if it's your topic. I was just wondering I was just wondering what you're up to. Explain to the audience why you're on your computer over there.

I know not really old school, but things from our childhood coming back and if we really need it. And this was the question I was asking myself when I was watching Fuller House because I only made it through two episodes where I'm like, this is just [\u00a0__\u00a0] terrible. So, it's just the show. It's more the like that's what I was saying when we were talking about this with at dinner or whatever. I watched three episodes. I watched the first two and I was like, \"This is bad.\" I had in the background. I was playing Vita. And then I jumped to the Hunter Pence episode. I was like, \"All right, cool. I've done my due diligence or whatever and I've seen Hunter, our boy, so I can move on.\" And I was like, \"This is this is bad, but Full House was always bad.\" Yeah. But of",

But of course, the I mean, that's that doesn't matter because the context is different. We were kids when we saw these and so we have um different memories and different ideas of what Full House really was. And uh also it was kind of a kid show back then, right? Like it wasn't supposed to be a Netflix exclusive kind of rated R program. Not that this one is, but that's not what Netflix has to be. Well, you know what I mean? Like it's it was supposed to be programming for like family programming evening around 7:00, you know, TGI Friday, all that [\u00a0__\u00a0] So bringing it back now, it's just a totally different era.

Um the uh you know we're going to get Twin Peaks back and that was like really tortured and stuff like that and Bay Watch is coming back and all this like so I'm wondering like first of all if you guys saw and what you thought of it because I I the first uh I was reading a review before I even watched the the first episode and they were saying that like the first episode is uh kind of the season finale we never got as people know like Full House was canceled so like we never got the finale the the like a real proper series finale. The last show, the last episode I think was when Michelle got like thrown off her horse and like had like amnesia and [\u00a0__\u00a0] like that. You guys remember that episode?

This is a nice way for them to like kind of bring it all uh full circle and like just see what all the characters doing. It's interesting. I mean the Brady Bunch did this and stuff. Lucy did this. It's not like it's not that unusual. Brady Bunch did it multiple times. um made things they like did like made for TV like reunion special over the years and the amazing 90s movie and that's the feel well that's different that was a parody I'm saying that was amazing both of those movies are great u but the but they really did come back like and do like Full House episode one Fuller House episode one is all it should have been you know what I mean if they would have just",

They're awful actors. We'll make their characters totally stupid. Return of the Twins makes it sound way more epic than I'm assuming it was. Well, yeah. Like the you know Jesse's kids. Um what do they call it? Alex and Nikki and Alex. Like we're little kids, you know? Like Oh, I thought you were the Olson twins. I was [\u00a0__\u00a0] I thought they weren't in this.

I think they all break the fourth wall for it. Do you think uh I was going to say Haley Joel Osman that he's not one of them? What does he have to say about this? I just, you know, I just watched the Entourage movie and he's in it. He's awesome in it. So, he's Does he play himself? Uh, no. He plays uh one like basically the lead antagonist. Okay.

Let's Let's not go to a dark place now. We're like, Entourage again. I saw that they were making movie. I'm like, they don't need to make a Entourage movie. They don't need to do this. This is pure fan service. And that's what Fuller House is, right? Like there's a lot of fans out there that just wanted to see them get back together. What I don't I'm not sure there was. I think it's one of those things. There's a lot of people that kind of liked it and were like, \"Oh, this is a cool idea for a trailer that I never need to see the full show for.\" And then here's the show.

Exactly. These shows that are so so typically a sign of the times, right? Um where it's it's just you got to kind of come at it from a different angle. And that's why like when you talked about the Brady Bunch movie, that was a perfect example of how you take a series that people have that's good has good brand recognition in the market and kind of turn it on its side and go we're gonna we're gonna have some fun with this. Same way with 21 Jump Street, right? where it was just making fun of the concept that these [\u00a0__\u00a0] kids, these guys, these adult males do not look anything like children and if they went to high school, they would just stick out like a sore thumb.

But again, that's taking it and kind of still turning it on its side of like saying like we're going to pull the curtains back. We're going to show you behind the scenes of this whole thing being made. See, I think like Girl Meets World is not for us. I think it's for kids nowadays. But I think they did a good job of doing the same thing, but for the right audience, you know, the audience wasn't us whereas Full House just continued. You know that maybe it's not people are really liking it. Like kids like it probably. I don't know. The thing about Yeah. That the Netflix whole thing like I don't",

That the Netflix whole thing like I don't think kids are like on that watching Full House like please like let me watch Full House Disney Channel. It's telling them don't take me. Yeah. It's it it begs the question of like can something can a situational comedy like that produced by Netflix really have that market penetration, right? Cuz that's not typically like what people go to Netflix for. But I mean I think I mean I think uh Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt did, right? Like that did well that that won Emmys and whatever. Handler shows doing well I guess. Um, so I guess Ziz, his show, Masters of N, that was I loved that show. But but I understand you're saying it's not being talked about on the level of I was going to say Seinfeld, but that was a different time and place. I guess Big Bang Theory now, right? Yeah.

But like all those shows you just named are shows that use the medium for what it for all of its virtues, right? Like Aziza's show can go a little runchier.

He makes everyone is makes a cameo in Entourage in the movie. And there's a great his seat is again another reminder of like, wow, he could not be far. His well, I guess it's him playing a character. It's not really him, but he goes there. He's talking to these two young girls. They're like, he's like, \"Wait a minute.\" And they've been like flirting like, \"You were on that show. Like, you were so cute. We always thought you were sexy.\" He's like, \"Wait a minute. Didn't you guys go to school with my daughter?\" And they're like, \"Yeah.\" And he walks over to Vince.

Ridiculous. Now, where do you think she's going dressed in dressed like that? I don't know that doesn't she work at a dog? No. I saw one episode and it was in I don't know which one it is.
