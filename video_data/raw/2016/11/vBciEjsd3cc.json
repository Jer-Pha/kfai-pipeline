Welcome to the Game Over Gregi Show. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the producer slash seducer, Nick Scarpino. Nick, where do we get these shirts? Probably filthy casual. It's one of those where Nick and I worry often at events about both coming downstairs in the producer slash seducer shirt, but we never think about coming to the office. Both of us rock and filthy casual shirts. Yeah. And we look good and they're different. To be fair it's a different shirt. Agreed. A cut of shirt. Agreed. Same graphic. Same design. Same graphic.

So you own the entire thing? Yes. How many people work there? About 10, 10 or 11. Cause I'm familiar with running cafe. I was going to say you ran a coffee shop. Only me and Alfredo. So with this, no, we did not own it. Did you make latte art? Fuck no. So I don't know if I ever properly made a latte, but how does this happen? Because I've seen a lot of people do it.

I don't know why more people don't do it. It's like such a draw, but like, I guess everyone has a boss and it takes a bit longer to do. And coffee's maybe not as hot. When Nick's there at Starbucks, like begging these people, like, please, please just draw my coffee. What would you ask them to draw Nick? Oh my God. Just a huge dick pic.

So if you wanted coffee, you were sort of forced to have whatever they had. And in Morocco and London specifically, it was really, really good. And they give you like really, really like, like non homogenized milk, things like that. So it's just a different taste, but you can't get, you're not going to get an iced coffee. You're not, you shouldn't like a Trenta iced coffee when you're in Marrakesh. Like it's just not going to happen. Were they really little cups?

Should the, should the three of us just go away? So you can bond on this. Um, so I was thinking about what my topic would be and I was listening through old podcasts and I came along the ones where Greg was just rambling for about 20 minutes or so. And I was thinking, what are my favorite childhood stories? So my favorite childhood story is a story from primary school or grade school. So essentially as an Asian kid, I went to an all white high school, noticing maybe two Asian kids in the entire school. So, um, no one had understood what hello pandas would, you know, guys know what hello pandas are. Exactly. Like cookie. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. With",

So I just wanted to eat and eat and eat. What the fuck? I know that. Um, you already girls, what happened? Okay. Literally no exercise, no change in habits whatsoever. Um, I hate people like this guy sucks. So essentially we had a canteen, which you guys know what a canteen is. Yeah. Star Wars. You go up there precisely. So it's essentially where you go to buy like fried foods and whatnot. And as an Asian kid, you didn't really get pocket money and stuff. Chores were just chores. So you don't get beat.

Just through parents, like packing lunch. So I was like, Oh, can I have two boxes today? I'm really hungry. So then I would trade them for like, I would sell them off for like a dollar a piece, 50 cents a piece. Cause all these kids had no idea what they were. So like hot commodity. Um, how many pain is there in a box? Roughly roughly 20. Wait, you'd sell them a dollar a piece or a package dollar a piece. Wow. A piece of margin. Very good margin considering they were free. Um, and then after a while I kind of got bored of all the canteen foods. So then I started trading them for favors. I wasn't a very bright kid.

Because I don't understand the breakdowns anymore grade school into junior high, but I was there, you know, K through eight before I went to a private school or high school from whatever nine through twelve. I want to say I did the newspaper in fourth grade and then fifth grade. And then I think they closed it. They were like, we're not going to do it for this year in the sixth grade.

It's like little, it's, I don't know. They're gas station food you would get. They're fantastic. They're little like little corn pieces of corn that are like fried and like hard and there's like seasoning on them. Are they pieces of corn? I don't remember. I don't know.

She definitely bought it smart and final or Costco. She had Costco for that. She got, she had the variety pack, that big pack. I remember that. But that my favorite thing about Mrs. Chindo totally unrelated to the story is she was trying to, she was a music teacher. So she tried to teach us the difference between like eighth notes or quarter notes or half notes or whatever. And so she would do it by different types of car.

But my greatest hustle story, the two that I've definitely told the show before, but the abbreviated versions are my PlayStation portable story where there was a trade in deal at EB and GameStop where you could trade in any at that point, current gen console games. And if you traded in three of them, you get a PlayStation portable game. So the system hadn't come out yet. So I did the math. I'm like, all right, if I were to get every launch title plus enough launch titles to trade the lunch titles in to get a PlayStation portable, how many fucking games would I need? Figured it out. It was like a hundred. Looked at the list of games you're allowed to do because obviously you can't be traded in no Madden",

Outlaw Golf, Christmas edition, nine more holes on the Xbox was the answer. So it was a blockbuster video exclusive. So this hustle involved, I think it was forcing Kevin or Alfredo, one of the two, cause I didn't have a car at the time, to drive me around to all the blockbusters in San Francisco to buy every single copy of this game they had that was 99 cents. Got it. Then we went to ceremony because at ceremony there is four EBS or now GameStops within walking distance. So there's two in the mall. There's one down at the Colma Target and there's one at the other, whatever the fuck mall it is near Home Depot. So we just went, cause obviously these places, they're like, you can't do this much.",

Next thing you know, I had the entire PSP launch lineup and it was fantastic. Fantastic. But my favorite hustle of all time was high school, me and Alfredo before we accomplished anything in our lives at all, decided to do a photo shoot, went to Kinko's, got a bunch of pictures printed of the two of us in very boy band style pictures. And then we set up a desk at my high school, just put a bunch of Sharpies down, just sat there and just started autographing on the next thing you know, we had a line of fucking people.

And I do think it's time to forgive Mel Gibson. Richard, can you enjoy an artist, or art, if you don't enjoy the artist? I think you can. Like Colin said, there are certain things that are somewhat unforgivable. So it's not so much you can't enjoy the art, but will your benefit the artist? And if you think that someone's done something that's so unspeakable that they don't deserve to be rewarded for anything that they do, like murder or rape or whatever, in terms of, oh, I don't want to support this because supporting this will give them millions and millions and millions of dollars.

It's not like, depending on the person, the actual merits of the art get reduced. It doesn't. Art is art. And sometimes the person does it. Sometimes the artist doing it will add value to that piece of art. But the actual value itself isn't really predicated on anything to do with the actual artist. Obviously in today's society, certain artists have a greater value. But in terms of just appreciating it, I don't think it really matters to that extent. See, I have a hard time. I'll admit that I have a hard time divorcing myself from that. If I know that a celebrity is crazy or does crazy shit, that's always playing around in the back of my mind.

Now, granted, I've never done anything to anyone, really, except for having a set of beliefs that I just can't fathom people actually holding onto. But then you have people like, you have someone like Chris Brown, right? Chris Brown has been in and out of the news all the time for doing horrible shit.

Yeah, I think that it comes down to, to answer the original question, I think that yes, you can separate it. But also, I don't think that the art is, I don't think any art is owed that separation. I think that it is a case by case type of situation. When it comes down to it, two people that I think are in a similar field are Kanye and Chris Brown when you're talking about this type of stuff. You can be critical of Kanye West's decisions or whatever, but he didn't beat someone. So it's like when you're looking at it from that perspective.

But I think that even then, no matter what, I can never listen to his work, which admittedly, I think has gotten worse over time. I can't separate it completely because I know the story. And I think that's kind of where it's at with a lot of contemporary artists is that their influencer aspect is part of the whole story. So it's like you can't separate it at all, whether it's a band or a movie or this or that. Reading about it, watching trailers, being on Twitter, knowing their presence is kind of part of the art.

But I clearly think that that's forgivable. And I think that that's kind of different. That builds into the art. Exactly. That has to do with that actually amplifies the experience, whether it's going to be positive or negative.

And in that regard, I think he deserves to sort of be where he's at, because he is polarizing, but he's, and he's doing what I think all art, whether it's good or bad should do, which is it evokes some sort of emotion, whether it's pure hatred or love or some mixture of the both, you do explore those in yourself as you're listening to or like perceiving his work. Yeah. Because Brown's just a dick. Well, that's my thing. Kanye has done and said, especially said many things that I disagree with the point of, it makes me like the music less and I am not interesting super into it.

There's no denying that. But it's like, I think that his talent is completely inescapable from the acts that he's done. And I feel like that is the type of situation where people should act on that. However, there's a lot of people that disagree and like, that's their prerogative entirely. And they can totally do that. What gets harder for me is looking at people that I look up to personally, like thinking of people that make internet videos or music alike or this or that or whatever. Hulk Hogan. Who? Hulk Hogan.

I think that we have to just look at it like, the way I kind of reflect on this is that, first of all, I think that like, forgiveness is a really noble and like righteous thing, right? But I do think that you have to, again, it's a level of degrees, there's no right or wrong answer to it. And maybe the easiest way to kind of come to an answer and a conclusion is to kind of reflect those things on yourself.

And I just am not comfortable going through my life if we'd reach that threshold of acceptability, like I was saying before, where it's like, well, it's a word or it's a minor action or it's something that can be corrected and you have a great life otherwise, or",

Orson Scott Card is one of the great sci-fi writers in America. Super fucking against gay marriage. This ruined a lot of shit for a lot of people. Like, you know, he, you know, wrote a shadow complex book. He wrote like, so he's got a connection to games. He, he obviously wrote Ender's Game, which is like one of the most critically acclaimed sci-fi books of the last 50 years. You know, people hate that motherfucker because of his stance on gay marriage. To me, I'm like, I don't know. You know, like, I don't, I don't, I don't agree with him at all. But yeah, yeah.

But then with like Marvel or DC, it's the same thing where I'm just like, how can you say that DC characters are better than Marvel? You're fucking crazy. Great. You got three. I'll give you three. But besides that, Marvel has all these characters. I'm just like, why do I care so much? It's like, I also, I love DC.",

It was one of my friends. Oh God. They're at a concert and one of the girls were sitting on a lawn chair, one of her friends wearing a romper and she decided it's just kind of scoot scooter, but to the edge of the romper, pull that romper to the side or to the edge of the chair, pull that romper to the side and just start split splashing away. And Gio just looks at her and she just kind of sitting there and just like it's happening and just lets it happen. And it's just like, huh? That seems a bridge too far. Cause you don't shit where you eat. I'm imagining they're on",

Like now it's going to smell like she did a little hole for first or is it just, she's scooting the old scooting boot. So did they move Arthur? No, they just stayed there. And it was one of those things where, so Gia didn't bring it up. Like they made eye contact. They had their moment, but like they were in a bigger group. I mean, I'm sure. Okay. Gia is involved. Yes. They were at school. No drunk. There you go. Yeah, exactly. So I don't know, but I just like this situation. It kind of bothers me just because I'm like, well, so what are we talking about now?

You act like you're fiddling with the trunk. You know, I'm talking of course for a guy here where you have a way to pee.

I'm not proud of it. Sometimes I get it. But like I was walking around my neighborhood the other night. I think it was a Saturday night and this is the Halloween weekend. So a lot of crazy people were out in my neighborhood having fun. But I think I went out at like seven 30 or eight o'clock, like right when it got dark and not like a block away from where I was, there was just a dude like looking at his friend and his friend was just chilling, peeing.

I'm like, you were getting, you went a half a block down and then decided that that was a good spot to pee. But like, I don't know. I'm like, you gotta be a little bit more savvy about it. But I mean, it sounds like both of these examples from the Marina are just the Marina kids being the Marina kids. It's the same thing.

So I was recently in the Marina in a totally different situation, but it was just me, you and your brother. And we just went to dinner and it was not like a party situation. This is going to be a good story. No. So I had parked, Nick lives in the middle of freaking Hillapalooza. Like there's so many Hills and like, we're talking San Francisco.

And I went and got dinner with you. And then by the time I came back, I was like, Oh God, I don't know where my car is. Like I didn't, I should have took a note. I have no idea what cross streets my car is on. So it took me an hour and a half, literally an hour and a half. It is now what? Like almost midnight.

So these are the things that go through my mind. What's it like peeing in Australia? Well, so in the city, there's not really bushes and stuff for you to pee in. So like pretty much people would go to like car parks. Like we have like the multi-story car parks and multiple them in one area. So essentially if you park in a corner, you're screwed. Your car is like going to get pissed on like easy.

You know, but when it rained recently in San Francisco, I love when it rains here because I'm like, all the pee is getting washed away. All the pee and all the poop. Because this is what everyone knows. One of the favorite San Francisco resident games is when you see poop on the ground is, is it human? Oh, it's delightful. So, and oftentimes it is. Yeah.
