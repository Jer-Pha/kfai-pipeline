Take a gander here at myself in the confidence monitor. There it is. Oh man, look at you. Tan as the day is long. I mean, I'm always tan. I got the olive skin. I don't go outside. But I'm very shiny today and I think it's because I've been moving about and kind of taking care of some errands. Because this is all we're doing today is this show. You know, so. Of course. Because we did Extra Life. Exactly, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for your support with Extra Life. What a fucking weekend that was, huh? Of course, the community started streaming as soon as we ended Colin and Greg Live on Friday. And I am with 24 hours of Twitch.tv slash Kind of Funny Games here at the Kind of Funny Studios with the help of Nick, Tim, Kevin, of course, who went above and beyond being here nonstop.

So far, because this is an ongoing thing, you can still donate if you want to if you want to head to Kind of Funny dot com slash Extra Life. So far, we have raised for the Children Miracle Network and they're the ones to take care of all these different hospitals and take care of sick kids all the time, $74,000. More than $74,000 raised by both your kindness of donating to this great community, this great charity, and of course, how generous you all were with your time and the ability to go out and play stuff and give money, spend time with us, watch us on Twitch.

Some chicanery going on. No, it was the decision we made last year at Extra Life that we wanted everybody to go to one thing. We just wanted to make something to make funny. Yeah, but you keep doing the thing where you make fun of me and you're joking about it and then the audience takes it seriously and then suddenly I got a big ego and a baby dick. All right.

How about the antipasto? Cause it's new. I'm a little gabba ghoul. What do you been playing? Pretty much nothing except for Titanfall two. Right. I've been messing a little bit with Tetris ultimate.

I was actually feeling like you could see Aaron was like crestfallen because we've been trying to unlock this forever. And it's really fucking hard. Isn't it? Is it to 30 or level 30? It's level 15, but it's heinous at level 15. No, no, I know. And I was like, are you fucking kidding me? Are you kidding me? Yeah. The trophy is also in that game.

As I said on Twitter, I think whenever I got into a Titan, I was disappointed. I don't like being in the Titan. I think the game feels too good when you're on foot. I understand that's the hallmark of the game. I also will defer to you on Titanfall expertise and the multiplayer because I've never played Titanfall until this game. I feel like there are certain games that I think do first person parkour and first person movement like really well. I think Dying Light is one of them. We mentioned that before.

So I talked about not seeing why this was so amazing early on in then on the games cast later in the week. I did a whole topic where I've beaten in. Here's what I think. And I came I stand by that I just don't think the single player is that amazing that it's doing anything spectacular. Fun game.

I'm even right now playing Call of Duty and granted in Call of Duty there are jetpacks again. You are running on walls. It is taking a lot of things from Titanfall's playbook. But there was a part today where I was going like oh there's a ledge and I got to it and then just slid down the wall. Motherfucker. Reach your hand out super soldier man do it.

So I don't have the breadth of knowledge to sit down and say oh my god this campaign is so much better. But when I was playing it I did not see why people are so fucking crazy for it. You? Same. Because you are Mr. First Person Shooter. Yeah I love shooters. I mean this with all due respect but the hyperbole about this game's campaign is through the fucking roof. It's a good game.

There's some pulse rifles and some good sniper rifles. The enemy AI seems not very good. And I was playing it on the master difficulty. I was going to say that's the same on master difficulty. The game has ridiculous spikes. That is on master difficulty. Specifically in boss fights. The fighting with Viper was ridiculous on master difficulty. Like so obnoxious.

It's strange. I mean that's not the game because I think the game is well above average in terms of shooters. And I think... I don't think it's... I'll say right off the bat I think Battlefield 1 is a much better game than Titanfall.

I wouldn't recommend it based only on the single player campaign because I feel like... If you're playing on normal difficulty that game is probably over in what? Six or seven hours? I mean I couldn't imagine it taking longer than that. It took me ten or twelve on Master at the most. And I have almost all the collectibles. I'm going to go back and farm.

Both Battlefield and this game on their hardest difficulty levels were just not that hard. Compared to veteran Call of Duty. And I'll see. It's the same thing as always. What we were talking about before. You go around the corner, you get shot. There's a guy there. Yeah, you just have to be patient.

I just felt like there was a lot more potential here for the narrative than was realized. And I thought that was disappointing. The one cool thing I think that the game did amongst a lot of cool things that I think the game did was that the game has a sense of scope. The world is big. The maps are huge. And there are long periods where you're not fighting.

It is still the worst selling PlayStation console though. It has only been on the market for three years and will all almost certainly eclipse all but PS two and perhaps PS one sales. PlayStation two sold 155 million units lifetime, making it the best selling console and best selling gaming hardware of all time. While PS one sold 102.5 million units, PlayStation three 83.8 million units and PlayStation portable 82 million units. Sony expects to ship 20 million PS fours by the end of its fiscal year, which will bring PS fours to 60 million units by March, 2017, which is right around where the NES sits lifetime sales at PlayStation slid 11.3% due primarily to foreign exchange rates while",

Now they're still working on it. They're still updating it. They're trying to get it closer to what their vision was. I played a lot of it when it came out ellipsis.

And I don't know where that comes from. I don't know if it's because the knee jerk reaction for me and for you, some of you who cared about PlayStation followed and covered it for so long is, is it the return of the hubris of the PlayStation 3 era or that PS2 to PS3 era? Is that what it is or is it? Yeah. Somebody, we went off of this thing of what this game was supposed to be and threw all this behind it. And by the time we realized it wasn't going to be that way,",

And then to jump through like, yeah, like, you know, Sony San Diego is like, we're going to try all this free to play stuff. We're going to try putting these games out, you know, in the weird access things and see how they go from there. And they had said from the beginning that was an experiment. But the problem is that we're paying attention to those experiments so that when it does close up shop and they finally fucking put out Kill Strain and then Kill Strain goes away pretty much immediately. The people who worked on it go away immediately get laid off. That's when it's like, oh fuck. Well, they learned. But then what does that mean for DrawndoDeath?

There's too many games released because now I don't have the benefit to be able to like, well, yeah, that's all been going wrong.

You know, Q games is a great example with it's like they come, they go to you and they pitch the tomorrow children. That's great, guys. That sounds interesting. Well, maybe we'll see a prototype of that. We want more pixel junk games because people fucking like them, you know? Yeah. And no, no, we don't get that.

The part before that in terms of marketing, I think goes back to the fact of we, you know, used to see PlayStation waste their money on marketing all the time. Do stupid stuff with it. Right. And is this now what it is in, I guess, 2015 when that game comes out that you don't need to worry about marking that game because it is great. We're going to talk about it.

This is a great tie back to what we were saying about second party ecosystems about sending games out to die, about not investing properly in marketing, about not identifying games early enough is that why own a PlayStation 4 if all you're going to play on it is the same games that everyone else is playing. Like there's something special about PlayStation or always has been about the exclusives. I'm not saying those exclusives don't exist. I like Killzone Shadowfall. I think it's actually a great game.

Where it is, you own a PlayStation 4 and it's the best selling console up until the last three months or whatever year after year, month after month here because of the fact that it just has the games you want to play.

So that's what I'm saying is like I need them. I need them to recalibrate a little bit. I think they know that internally. Like what is important to your game or what is important to the player on PlayStation 4? What do they want? Well, the question is, do they understand that?

Obviously screenshots for like the last 30 seconds, like around where it wants to take it. Because, yeah, it's always just you standing there looking at something, loading screens, just nothing. I just don't get it. A grenade explosion. It's like, whatever. Yeah, I would say one out of every 30 is like, OK, that's a cool screenshot. But otherwise, yeah, why the hell are you doing this?

For those of us who already have embraced the digital future, PSN has huge restrictions on how it handles a second console. Currently, you can link your account to a PS4 as a primary console and everyone who signs into that system, such as your family, can play your games. However, on a second console that you sign into, only you can play the games you own, unlike PlayStation 3. So in a household with two PS4s of any type, your primary would have to be the family console and your secondary PS4 would have to be only used by yourself.

Bring that fucking sweet ass to the PlayStation. I love you show everyone Jaffe wouldn't say beyond. Yeah, that was. And then he apologized. I don't know. That was so awesome.
