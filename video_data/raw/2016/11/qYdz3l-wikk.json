I was thinking I was thinking about this and I want to talk about it in a deeper sense than um than what we might than what we might uh be thinking. We, for instance, the four of us and and I don't know if you feel the same way. We're all huge Apple fans, right? You don't use, you're an Android person. Yes. Okay. So, you're more like So, the four of us are are big Apple big Apple users. We like um we cut our videos on Premiere. We uh is not Apple. No, I'm saying we cut our It's Adobe.

But I like wishbone Italian dressing and 10 out of 10 times, 100 out of 100 times, I'll buy wishbone dressing and if it doesn't if it's not there, I just won't eat Italian dressing. Yeah. So, I'm curious like what you guys like what your what your what your not Jesus God almighty what your not so standard kind of um brand loyalties are and um I want to see how deep and weird we can get with this in terms of like well how how how deep down the rabbit hole can we get with like the things that you like where you'll only buy something from a specific brand or you have a loyalty to another brand that's not",

What's the only brand we wear? Filthy casual. God damn it. Uh, no, this is a great topic and it's funny to think about what brands you are loyal to and stuff, right? I mean, for me, and this actually stems a little bit from our conversation in the first topic about like Catholic school and stuff, right? I'm extremely unwaveringly loyal to Converse All-Star, right? The Converse brand or whatever.

And I I would I remember one time putting on another pair of shoes like after the fact of wearing them putting on and like they felt like I was wearing clown shoes cuz Converse are so molded to your feet cuz they're just canvas canvas and rubber. You put these things on, they felt huge. Like oh my god, I could never ever stop. I could never go back that way and do something differently. I'm the same way with Vans. I've been buying vans since I was a kid. There's a there was a brief period I think in the 90s where I dropped out of the van phenomena, but then I came back strong uh in the early 2000s.

And I was like, they'll let you wear checkered shoes. Like that's a thing you can do? Like I didn't know you could do that. That's like But like when you're a kid, you're like, I I just like this like a checkered shoe blows your [\u00a0__\u00a0] mind. Yeah. shoes come home or you go there and your parents pick them and that's what they are, right? That's what it was. My mom used to like, you know, when we were kids, they would go to the cheapest place possible cuz when you're a kid, you're growing. So, like you're growing out of the shoes in 6 months anyway.

Um, but Vans were always the one thing we got to go and because you wear through them so fast cuz you only have one pair. You got to do them every like every like three or four months. You'd be back to the Van store like, \"So, I got a chance on that. I'll get the gray checker this time and then on that one I'll get the lime checker and then I'll get a slip-on also cuz I love slip-ons cuz they remind me of ninja shoes. Um of course naturally. Um so I've been a pretty big like I love Vans. Um I think I'll probably always have a pair of Vans somewhere. And recently I've bought the exact same pair of Vans.

But it's the same thing of like my the origin of that is that going to get my first pair of lace up shoes at Geishi's shoes down in Glennel in Illinois and going in there and seeing a red high top Converse like and I remember I if you now of course Converse are everywhere and they're so they're trendy or whatever you want to call them but like forever in every movie at least one character is wearing Converse high tops. You know what I mean? their gym shoes and so it was always kids wearing them and monster squatter or whatever or Tom Hanks and the man with one red shoe and all these different things like there's so many instances of that was such an iconic thing growing up that I knew I wanted that.

No, they do make they do make stuff that I that I find is is I've had I mean I've had really pricey when you know I've had projects that I've edited on PCs and Mac and like I've had problems with both. So I'm not going to sit here and say like one platform has been historically better for me than the other. I think really with that it just boils down to aesthetics.

I'm not going You can't argue those. You just physically can't. I just specked one out the other day for shits and giggles that was like $4,700 for a laptop. A garbage laptop. Yeah, it's not great.

It's got, you know, Thunderbolts, USBs, everything you buy, the HDMI, a retina display, an amazing touchpad that doesn't have a 18 button touch thing in it. Like it's just a normal touchpad. So it it still works perfectly. Um but those are things that are like that to me is a pleasure to use. I look forward to using that and when I have to work those long hours, that extra little bit of inspiration that I look at this thing and and think how many hours went into designing this and like this thing is like they they've put these things in like mo the MoMA, you know, like the these are in museums because they're they're just heralded as these [\u00a0__\u00a0] amazing pieces of art that are also tools, you know?

That's that's not my way of thinking. That's not my simple, clean design aesthetic.\" They'll be getting closer in the last couple years. I just I can't think of one. I mean, again, granted, I'm not going out I'm not going to the Windows store every day looking at surfaces, looking at these things. Like, I think that's cool.

You Richard, what brands are What are you loyal to? Well, with the brand loyalty thing, it's more of a security thing for me. So, like it's like kind of like a security blanket. So, the only thing I could really think of is there's this like Chinese restaurant that I always go to. I don't even bloody know the name of the place. It's the Chinese restaurant. the Chinese restaurant. And I know objectively it's not the best Chinese food in in the city, but it's what I grew up on.

Also, to go along with the shoe thing, um for a long period of time, I only wore Adidas just because when I was growing up, you had like Nike uh Nike, sorry, Adidas, and then like a couple of skate brands. And Adidas was the only one where you didn't feel kind of bad for not being into a certain sport or activity for wearing. So like if you I did though. I used to wear like their soccer shoes every once in a while. I'm like, I can't play soccer. Really? Oh, with the weird flop down tongue thing. Yeah. Yeah. I used to love those. Oh, the cleats.

Portillos is the brand I'm incredibly loyal to and that's the thing of it's always interesting when I talk about this you know this is home to me. This is you know Portillos Hot Dogs. this is Chicago and then kids will hit me up like they're usually new to the show or me or whatever and be like, \"Well, what about Jean and Judes or what about Wiener Circle or what?\" I'm like, \"No, no, you're missing the point.
