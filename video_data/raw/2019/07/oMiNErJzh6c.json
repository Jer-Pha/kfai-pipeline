Mario's priorities lie IGN also had a wickiup obviously explaining all this for people like myself who were jumping in today I thought I would read the bullet points from that you get one heart every 30 minutes and you can have a maximum of 5 hearts you can receive hearts from a friend but a player can only give you can only give one heart to one friend per day you get one heart for clearing a stage note you do not get hearts for clearing stage that was our it has already been cleared miscellaneous prizes via question mark blocks also",
