PC right but it does matter back to the 90s of gaming 60 frames-per-second so what if you could go back and play breath of the wild at 60 frames per second I mean those little improvements could be huge quality life improves for him for old stuff you know Smash Brothers already runs at 60 and stuff like that but that's what the appeal is for me which is why I'd go in the other direction for us the portability but of course your battery",
