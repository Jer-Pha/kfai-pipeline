    "title": "How to Make Buffalo Blue Burgers - Cooking with Greggy",
    "description": "Greg's back with Second Helpings to show you how to make some bomb ass Buffalo sauce/blue cheese burgers. \n\nBURGERS\n1) Take about a pound/pound and a quarter of 80/20 ground beef and mix it in a bowl with your choice of seasoning. I say you use Joe Beef steak seasoning and worcester sauce. Mix it good.\n2) Get a handful of beef, and pound them from the center out. You want a divot in there.\n3) Put a cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Toss a hunk of butter in there. Toss the Burgers in there.\n4) Cook them until their done through. I dunno. Five minutes a side? Pay attention to them and try not to flip them more than once. \n5) They\u2019re done. \n\nSAUCE\n1) Take a big ol\u2019 hunk of blue cheese and put it in the bowl.\n2) Dump some Frank\u2019s Red Hot in there.\n3) Mix it up.\n4) Taste it. You like it? If not, add more sauce or cheese and mix it up. Like it? You\u2019re done.\n\nToast your buns, put the burger on the bun, and top with the sauce.
