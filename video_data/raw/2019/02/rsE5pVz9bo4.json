However, I see a lot of people criticizing the game for being incomplete (ie: not a lot of endgame content at the moment, bugs, etc.). This leads me to my question. What would you consider a successful launch for a games as a service? - William LaRocque\n00:49:12 - Hey guys, so, yesterday you talked about anthem and how early reviews have said the game was okay, but not spectacular. Fallout 76 was basically in the same boat and was seen as a complete failure when it launched. Why is it that anthem seems to get a pass for a lot of their issues we're seeing in the pre-release while 76 wasn't? - Amplitude\n00:57:10 - Squad Up: Shan Valloric(PS4) - ButterCadillac\n00:58:32 - You\u2018re Wrong\nTomorrow\u2019s host: Greg and Andrea\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunnygames?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunnygames\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller and Tim Gettys talk about the biggest stories in Video Games.\n\nBackground Wall Art by Orioto - https://www.facebook.com/OriotoPosters/",
