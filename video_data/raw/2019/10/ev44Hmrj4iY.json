Did this move the needle for you guys on getting the game or do you feel this would of been a better to have her in the game and people find out when they play the game? - Borzen00\n00:14:12 Best Friend Q. - Do you think, in modern games criticism, that length is something that should even factor into reviews anymore? Or is it perhaps something of a \"when it feels right\" situation? - Chad Betteridge\n00:21:50 - World\u2019s First for the Destiny Raid, Samuel Horti @ PC Gamer\n00:24:15 Best Friend Q. - The raid race in Destiny 2 began Saturday and after a surprisingly short 7 hours it was cleared! It's surprising that such a large expansion dropped a raid that could be cleared so quickly, although black armory was cleared in roughly that amount of time as well. Do you think perhaps the shorter clear time was to entice the massive flow of new players joining up with New Light? - Alex Russ (Zero Syndicate)\n00:32:06 - Former Nintendo lawyer and Kirby namesake John Kirby dies, James Batchelor GIB\n00:33:40 - Pokemon Stream all but confirms Galarian Ponyta, Kevin Knezevic @ GameSpot\n00:44:22 - Out today\n00:45:16 -  HIMS\n00:46:58 -  QUIP\nReader mail   -\n00:48:00 - Iron Man VR got the push to February 2020 which is releasing near a bunch of indie titles such as The Last of Us Part 2, Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Watchdogs Legion. Is this title doomed? Should Sony have waited? - Frankfurtter\n00:50:50 - One Night Stand just released on Nintendo Switch, which is a game I first saw during the Kinda Funny Games Showcase. I was just wondering if anyone at KF have played it and if so, what you thought of it. It seems like a Greg Miller game for sure, and I\u2019d love to hear some spoiler-free impressions before I take the dive. - Mitchell\n00:54:00 - I have two questions regarding Google Stadia. Bruce, what do you think of Google Stadia and the potential of games as a medium moving towards a streaming future? Greg, when is your best guess as to when we will find out the official launch date for Stadia, or at the very least when will the Founders be able to claim their names?  - The Five Star Man\n00:58:12 - Squad Up: Anthony(PS4) - timmy_darco (please shu, let me change my name without potentially screwing up a bunch of stuff)\n00:59:42 - You\u2018re Wrong\nTomorrow\u2019s Hosts:Greg and Bruce Greene\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunnygames?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunnygames\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller and Tim Gettys talk about the biggest stories in Video Games.\n\nBackground Wall Art by Orioto - https://www.facebook.com/OriotoPosters/",
