    "description": "Today, Greg's making Yotam Ottolenghi's Ricotta and Oregano Meatballs from the cookbook \"Simple,\" and you should, too!\n \nINGREDIENTS\n- 1/4 cup olive oil\n- 1 large onion, chopped\n- 2 garlic cloves, minced \n- 1/2 cup oregano leaves, chopped\n- 1 can of chopped tomatoes\n- 1 cup chicken stock\n- salt and black pepper\n- 1-pound 2 ounces of ground 80/20 beef\n- 2 cups breadcrumbs\n- 9 oz ricotta\n- 2 and a fourth cups of grated Parmesan\n- 1 egg\n- 1 cup parsley \n\nDIRECTIONS\n1) Get your tomato sauce going. From scratch or from a can. Your call. If you wanna make the sauce these balls come from, here you go: https://www.cancook.co/ricotta-and-oregano-meatballs/ (Note, you'll need to increase ingredient portions if you wanna make the sauce from scratch.)\n\n2) Make the balls. Put the onion, garlic, and oregano in a large bowl with the beef, breadcrumbs, ricotta, Parmesan, egg, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix it with your hands, and make into 12-14 balls.\n\n3) Put a tablespoon of olive oil into a large frying pan. Once hot, add the balls in batches without overcrowding. Sear for 8 minutes while constantly turning. Transfer to separate plate.\n\n4) Once they're all seared, lower them into your sauce and cover with stock so that the balls are almost covered. Cover and simmer over medium low for 30 minutes. \n\n5) Turn off the heat and serve.\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunny\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller, Tim Gettys, and Nick Scarpino talk about the biggest stories in nerd culture.\n\nMusic by Tonedeff - http://www.QN5.com",
