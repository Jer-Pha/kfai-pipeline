    "title": "How to Make Butternut Squash and Sage Gnocchi - Cooking with Greggy",
    "description": "This week on Cooking with Greggy, Greg's making Butternut Squash, Sage, and Sausage Gnocchi. Greg and Gen made it for Joey one time and she demanded that it be included in Second Helpings. \n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n-1 butternut squash (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds)\n-2 tablespoons olive oil\n-6 links (about 1 1/2 pounds) fresh sweet sausage with fennel, casings removed\n-4 tablespoons butter\n-16 large fresh sage leaves\n-4 cloves garlic, crushed\n-Salt and pepper\n-About 1/4 teaspoon (a couple of pinches) freshly grated nutmeg\n-1 cup white wine\n-1 1/2 to 2 cups chicken stock\n-1 1/2 pounds fresh gnocchi\n-Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, for serving\n\nDIRECTIONS\n1) Preheat the oven to 475\u00b0F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the gnocchi.\n \n2) Preheat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high.\n\n3) Cut the neck off the squash; peel and cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch cubes. Reserve the bulb portion to roast for another meal.\n \n4) Add the olive oil to the skillet, two turns of the pan then add the sausage. Cook, stirring occasionally and breaking it up into bite-size pieces, until browned, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a bowl.\n \n5) Add the butter to the skillet and melt then add the sage; cook until crispy and the butter browns, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the sage to a paper towel.\n \n6) Add the garlic to the skillet; stir until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Add the squash; season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Add the wine and cook, stirring often, until reduced a bit, about 1 minute. Add 1 1/2 to 2 cups stock, depending on how saucy you want the dish to be, and bring to a bubble. Add the reserved sausage then transfer skillet to the oven. Roast until the squash is tender, 12-15 minutes.\n \n7) Salt the boiling water, add the gnocchi and cook until they float to the surface, about 3 minutes. Drain and toss with the squash and sausage sauce; season. Top with the sage leaves. Serve with the grated cheese for passing at the table.\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunny\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller, Tim Gettys, and Nick Scarpino talk about the biggest stories in nerd culture.\n\nMusic by Tonedeff - http://www.QN5.com",
