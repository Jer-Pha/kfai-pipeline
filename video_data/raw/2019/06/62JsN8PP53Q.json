    "description": "For the season finale of Cooking with Greggy, learn how to make this very easy and impressive looking rack of lamb!\n\nFrom the Blue Apron Cookbook\u2026\nINGREDIENTS\n1 rack of lamb (7 or 8 bones, about 1.5 pounds)\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, plus 2 teaspoons for drizzling\nKosher salt and black pepper\n1 clove garlic, finely grated into a paste\n1/4 cup Dijon mustard\n1.5 tablespoons finely chopped fresh tarragon leaves\n1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs\n1 large egg white, beaten\n\n1) Pat the lamb dry with paper towels. Drizzle with the 2 teaspoons olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and let stand 30 minutes.\n2) Preheat oven to 450 degrees.\n3) In a bowl combine with garlic paste, mustard, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, tarragon, breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper.\n4) Using a pastry brush, brush the outer side of the lamb with the egg white. Coat the lamb in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing to adhere.\n5) Transfer the lamb -- breadcrumb side up -- to a wire rack on a sheet pan. Roast for 28 to 30 minutes until the breadcrumbs have browned and the meat registers 140 degrees with a thermometer. Let rest 15 minutes.\n6) Slice and pray.\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunny\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller, Tim Gettys, and Nick Scarpino talk about the biggest stories in nerd culture.\n\nMusic by Tonedeff - http://www.QN5.com",
