Also, Barrett joins the stream to show off 40 minutes of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD. He'll share his thoughts so far and what he thinks of the HD boost and if Mike should finally play a Zelda game cause he's a jabroni who refuses to play great games!\n\nSubscribe And Ring The Notification Bell: \nKinda Funny: http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub_confirmation=1\nKinda Funny Games: http://www.youtube.com/kindafunnygames?sub_confirmation=1\nKinda Funny Plays: http://www.youtube.com/kindafunnyplays?sub_confirmation=1\n\nGet The Shows Ad-Free On Patreon: \nKinda Funny http://www.patreon.com/KindaFunny \nKinda Funny Games http://www.patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames\n\nBuy Some Merch: http://www.kindafunny.com/store \n\nFollow Us On Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids \n\nFollow Us On Instagram: http://instagram.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nWatch Us Live On Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames\n\nListen To Our Podcasts On Your Favorite Podcast Service:\nThe Kinda Funny Podcast: https://bit.ly/3wA9GVo\nIn Review \u2013 Movies Ranked, Reviewed, & Recapped: https://bit.ly/2VAgdT7\nKinda Funny Reactions \u2013 TV & Movie Reviews Podcast: https://bit.ly/3e7yQ75\nKinda Funny Gamescast: https://bit.ly/3wBgRwg\nKinda Funny Games Daily: https://bit.ly/2T3Y3rS\nPS I Love You XOXO \u2013 A PlayStation Podcast: https://bit.ly/3r3rjvB\nKinda Funny Xcast \u2013 An Xbox Podcast: https://bit.ly/36twqvD\n\nFollow The Kinda Funny Team On Twitter:\nGreg Miller: https://twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nTim Gettys: https://twitter.com/TimGettys\nNick Scarpino: https://twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nAndy Cortez: https://twitter.com/TheAndyCortez\nBlessing Adeoye: https://twitter.com/BlessingJr\nMike Howard: https://twitter.com/SnowBikeMike\nKevin Coello: https://twitter.com/KindaFunnyKevin\nJoey Noelle: https://twitter.com/joeynoelle\nBarrett Courtney: https://twitter.com/SadBoyBarrett\nRoger Pokorny: https://twitter.com/rogformer\nGreg Gettys: https://twitter.com/KindaCoolGreg\nGary Whitta: https://twitter.com/garywhitta\nParris Lilly: https://twitter.com/vicious696\nJanet Garcia: https://twitter.com/Gameonysus\n\nIn Review Intro Videos by: https://twitter.com/CameronKen\nIn Review Intro Music by: https://twitter.com/CarterHarrell",
