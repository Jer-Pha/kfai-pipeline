We always talk about voting with our wallet and I truly believe the Nintendo Switch Online is a bad service. Should I sacrifice playing games like mario kart, splatoon etc to make a point to Nintendo that this needs to be better or is it the fact that it's only $20 that i shouldn't be complaining as much. - Anthony\n00:56:56 - On Friday Jared explained that final fantasy 7,9, 10 and more are coming to switch. More surprisingly, and not covered by kfgd on Friday, they're also coming to Xbox. This is amazing because lack of jrpgs has arguably been xboxes Achilles heel this gen.
