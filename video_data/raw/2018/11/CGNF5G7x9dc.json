Game & Watch yeah so I think that was the only reason that it's not final final but anyways that was cool new characters are great Smash Bros and Smash Bros right um playing the modes with the charging the final smash up you know time out there's a new thing now where before you have to get the Smash Ball to get the final smash now there's a new mode that's a bit more",
