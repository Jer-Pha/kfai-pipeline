Welcome to a conversation with Colin. I'm Greg and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes shut up out there. Thank you. Sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. You're allowed. So every Tuesday and Thursday I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, throw it at him, and we talk it out for your amusement. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to us on YouTube, share it with your friends. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is smoking, drugs, and alcohol from bmack182. Smoking, drugs, and alcohol. It's common. There's commas in there. Smoking. So, this is about the Oxford comma, right? Exactly. Yeah. He has three different things here. Not just smoking drugs. Smoking, comma, drugs, alcohol, and alcohol. Okay, first off, I'll start. I wish I was dumber so that I could smoke cuz smoking looks cool. Period.",

It'd be [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome. God, I love smoking, but it kills you.\" Yeah. Now, I choose to kill myself with alcohol and food. It's interesting, actually. Uh the the scientific consensus on smoking killing you. This is just an aside, by the way, is that they're not positive that it kills you. Now, no, no, listen to what I'm saying. I'm listening. I ain't going anywhere. during the global warming debate that's happening like the last couple weeks cuz that we're signing like new treaties and stuff like that.

Okay, which is interesting. And they're basically and they're basically saying that like yeah we're positive but we can never be super positive about anything. So I just thought that was an interesting aside. Obviously, smoking kills people, but they're not 100% positive. Okay. If I did electronic cigarettes, would that kill me, too? I don't know what the deal is with those. That's water vapor, isn't it? Nick says no. Vapor. Just vapor. I might start doing that. Yeah. There are chemicals in it, though. Well, but it will give",

Uh, so, uh, you got a cat hair in your hair. Hold on. I got it. You got Okay, good. Uh, so when I was younger in high school, I wanted to smoke cigarettes because like I agreed it looked cool and it looked fun and I could never really get into it, you know, like I I was like, I want to smoke cigarettes and I just couldn't do it. And then I and in college I started smoking cloves and those were pretty good, but they burn forever. They just never stop burning and then you're wasting like half of them and they're expensive.

And I understand that uh there are social uh repercussions to doing drugs, including crime. You commit crimes when you're feing, when you need money for crack or heroin or whatever, and you do stupid things. But uh I still feel I still take a very libertarian slant with drugs which is that like the act of doing drugs shouldn't be illegal. The the maybe the sale of drugs should be illegal or the cultivation of drugs should be illegal depending on but like we should you know uh it's a victimless crime until the crime is committed to fund their So is it kind of a chicken and the egg thing?

Um I just it's like I know from experience it's just like a future crime kind of thing, right? like we don't know that the crime is committed until the crime is committed. I just I'm not comfortable with having millions of people in the United States in jail, most of which are nonviolent drug offenders. I just think that that is [\u00a0__\u00a0] stupid. It's a waste of money and it's, you know, for the the land of the free, you know, we we have more people in prison per our population than anywhere in the world, including places that you think like China or North Korea would have more people.

And he's been starting a basketball league over there. So, everything's pretty cool uh over there. But I just feel like the the whole war on drugs has been a failure that um you know, the the obvious thing is to not legalize all drugs. Obviously, marijuana should be legal. Um you know uh even thing like anything that's natural. I think even mushrooms should be probably legal. But but uh everything should be decriminalized. You shouldn't criminalize the use of drugs. You should try to help people if you know because you shouldn't be doing certain you know things. I don't think there's any harm in smoking weed. I think that there's harm in doing heroin or doing coke obviously. But but is the person who's doing coke the",

Should we legalize marijuana, which we're kind of doing already? We're on the track there. And then should the government sell it and then get us out of debt? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so the whole this is there's an interesting thing going on in Colorado right now because in Colorado and in Washington, marijuana is now legal and and they well and it's not just for medical purposes, like it's legal. So, uh, they have to figure out a way to sell it. And the whole thing that they're struggling with in Colorado right now is how much they're going to tax it because they want to tax it to such a degree that it will actually be cheaper on the black market.

See, this is the problem that they have to balance is you get it. You you destroy the black market by undercutting the black market and making something legal. But if you make something too expensive, the black market still exists and the prices drop in the black market. So people still have the illegal conduit to use something that is otherwise. But I think I think a big part of it would be the ease, right? If I could walk into a 7-Eleven and buy a thing of weed or whatever, even if it was more expensive than a dude around the corner, I don't know. I'm I'm just some fat white guy. I don't want to go to the dude around the corner of the alley, get stabbed. I just want to buy at a 7-Eleven. Uh some slim gyms. I don't know. I mean, we don't know how that's all going to play out.

I mean, we in 2010, we voted in in California for for uh you know, marijuana legalization. Actually got voted down, which was whichucks. No one expected that was going to happen. Um so yeah, I think that marijuana should be legal. Um for sure. And uh other drugs, like those are problems. People shouldn't be addicted or be doing these drugs. I just wonder what it says about our society that it is criminal to do those drugs as opposed to saying like maybe you need help. Maybe we need to wean you off of these things. Maybe it's just cheaper to put some of these people in programs than to put them in prison, you know. Yeah. I'm not saying the person who's, you know, making the meth shouldn't go to prison.

Alcohol is fine. I think the age of alcohol consumption should probably be lowered. Actually, please silence your phones when watching studio audience. Uh yeah, I my whole thing is like if you're old enough to die in a war, you're old enough to drink. That was always my thing when I was 18 and I told everybody when I turned 21, I'm going to be very vocal about changing. And then I turned 21, I was like, \"Ah, [\u00a0__\u00a0] you kids. It's your problem now.\" I don't know. I I think 18 should and probably will again be the legal age at some point. Yeah. When No, I don't think it ever will. We'll never go back.

That's weird. That like that just doesn't jive at all. You know, the 21-year-old like thing is just arbitrary and that's that's not the way it is in in other countries. So, um you know there's a culture of drinking in places like I'm not saying you're drinking when you're 12 in France, but there's a culture of drinking in China or like when you're a young kid and even in Canada you can drink when you're young.

Like, if you just legalize marijuana, then the whole uh you know, when you're 15 or 16, you're like, \"This is so cool.\" Whatever. But then you realize like anyone can just walk into a store and buy it. Then it becomes less cool to do it. and and you do it, you know, for the right reasons, which is you want to relax or whatever it is you want to do, but not not to do it just because of peer pressure or because it's illegal.
