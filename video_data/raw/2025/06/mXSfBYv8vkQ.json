They were just, you know, it's always fun to have Roger and Mike in the same room as they argue like an old married couple and then just Andy in between it all just causing chaos. Yeah, they do feel they do give married couple vibes and Andy is the child that they both own. Own. Yeah, they like here's the thing, right?
