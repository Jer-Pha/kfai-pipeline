Yeah, those those are like some of my like oh, put them on every goddamn day. Obsessed with them things. Um so interesting that he did this. Music was done by Ken Thorne, which is interesting because composer John Williams was originally slated to score Superman 2, whereby he was given a screening uh with the director and when they left the room, Williams and Lester fell into an argument uh when the other the person returned, Williams told him that he could not get along with this man.

Uh so during Superman 1 uh the Sulkins bring in Richard Lester to be a gobetween that this is as I talked about it last night. Exactly. That's what Yeah, I'm back. I'm backing you up. Uh, but the idea being of course that they they had worked with him on three musketeers and then four musketeers, which of course is the thing we talked about last week that the director's guild had to make a [\u00a0__\u00a0] rule that you have they",

All right, whatever. What's awesome about this is that they bring in Lester to be the go-between because Donner's no longer talking to them and won't let them on set and yada yada yada, right? [\u00a0__\u00a0] batshit crazy. To make it even crazier, the reason they do this with Lester is that Lester had a lawsuit against the Sulkins for money he was owed based on all this different stuff. Then there's some shenanigans that it was like tied up in the Bahamas. So, they couldn't pay him the money even when he won the lawsuit. So, their thing was, \"We'll compensate you if you come in to help us with Superman and be this go-between whatever, whatever.\" And Dick",

So, I think they're fine, but it's a convoluted thing. And I think you the the the anger is really the Sulkins and Spangler here, right? Of like who Donner's mad about, right? So, as we've talked about last week, they're filming these movies back toback, same time period. They're going all at once, right? What I didn't get too far into last week cuz come on now, we had a schedule to keep was that at some point they are like, \"Yo, you're behind on Superman the movie. We need to pause Superman 2 and you need to come over and finish Superman the movie.\" And D's like, \"Okay, no big deal.\" leaving what reports are and this is all you know so nebulous but 70 to 75% of Richard Donner's Superman 2 filmed but not finished",

Do you know this one? Spangler is at a Christmas party and a variety reporter comes up to him and is like, \"Hey, like congrats on Superman the movie. I heard like, you know, it was tense between you and Donner.\" And Spangler's like, \"Yeah, it was, you know what I mean, but he's a talented filmmaker and you know, I'm excited to work with him on Superman part two.\" And Donner's direct quote",

He goes, \"If he's on it, I'm not.\" And that's published, right? So, they're just [\u00a0__\u00a0] fighting in the press about it. If that wasn't enough, Superman the movie comes out. It's a humongous success. Who did we talk about last week, Nick? Who loves money and want to do as little work as possible? Marlin Brando. Marlon Brando sues the Sulkins after Superman return after Superman one, saying, \"Hey, you're you owe me a whole bunch of money.\" He sues Yeah. $50,000 is what he sues him.

No. Margot Kid definitely looks different, especially when you go back and watch the the Donner cut because there are moments where you're like, she looks like she's 23 years old in moments and then when she's in Niagara Falls, she looks like she's aged 10 years. And it's not she doesn't look bad. It's just like even people are changing. Even Chris Reeve looks like he's youthful. He looks like this youthful like kid who's talking to his dad and being like, I'm just in love. I don't know what to do.

Let's let's stick with with our our thoughts real quick before we then get into the plot. We can actually start interusing. Nick, what are your thoughts on Superman 2, the Lester cut, and now that you've seen the Donner cut, how do you think they fair together going back? Growing up, we'll just start with the Lester cut. Growing up, this was always my favorite, right? Because for one reason, one reason only. This is the only Superman movie up to this point that actually had Superman fighting super villains villains. He had somebody to face off against and it was scary. And when you were a kid, you're like, he can't beat these people cuz it's three Superman. And they make a point of",

And they make a point of that. And I think they really hammered that home. And it's scary, right? At some point, Superman, he realized, you see him realize at the end that he's like, \"Fuck, I got to get out of here before they destroy Metropolis.\" But everyone calls him a [\u00a0__\u00a0] coward. And because he has to leave, he has to go outsmart them, which I always thought was really cool. And I love that he has to outsmart them. I love they set up the thing. So, I absolutely love this movie. Watching it back to back with Superman 1, I do agree that Superman 1 is is a better overall Superman experience because it has those hype moments. has the helicopter sequence, right? It has him being Superman and and the and the wonder of saving Air Force One and then taking a cat out of the screen, giving it to and that's just so",

And I think their relationship and their chemistry was so solid in that and you could just tell that movie that movie has something special. It has issues, but it has something special to it. Watching this again, it is lesser in in my eyes. Not by much, but it is lesser because it is missing those heart. Then you watch the Donner cut and all of that heart and more comes back in and it's a it's wild. It's wild how much I liked the Donner cut as opposed to the less. That was your first time seeing it. My very first time seeing it. Um because of that screen test moment because you see Margot Kid and Chris Reev when they're like I mean that makes total sense now cuz I was like why the [\u00a0__\u00a0] do they look two years younger in this in these scenes?

Donner in my limited use of how to be a filmmaker is taking Lester stuff and inserting it just so you keep the beat of where the characters are. Again though, Donner didn't edit this. Well, whoever. Yeah. Yeah. Donner signed off on it. Donner never wanted to have anything to do with this. And correct me if I'm wrong, but the people I think you know more about this part than I do. I think it was like uh Mangoitz and a couple other people were like they they had come to him and said, \"Hey man, we have enough footage to probably put together something for you. Are you cool with it?\" And I think Donner was just like whatever. Like I'm past it at this point and he watched it. He goes, \"Cool. I'll sign off on that.

He had to officially sign off, but I don't know if he was sitting in the edit room actually watching the stuff. So there's things inserted here that I think are still weird pace and weird performances. And so then it I don't want to make it sound like the Donner cuts I think a glowing thing. It's just more that I look at and I go, \"Fuck, why can't you stay out of this guy's way? Let him make the movie.\" That's my thing is like I see exactly what you're saying. My mind is your mind.

Like you can't do that. and she has a line about I don't even know what to call you. And then the great call back to the very beginning ride of like whatever the setup is and she she just goes just say you love me which of course is what he said back to her in the fortress or whatever. And then he's like you know what rewinding time telekinesis fingers. This weirdass this weird ability to multiply myself. Not enough.

Dionist in the chat brings up an honorable mention for sure, which is the Lex baby. West Baby Secret Delight for sure. No, but let me tell you, when I was a kid, I'll put it in there for you. Watching this, if I had Teo, I would have paused on that scene where her leg is up in the uh in the Daily Planet in the White House. Lex Baby is on there. And we also need to remind the chat, no future spoilers. We don't talk about what's coming. Tim hasn't seen them. Don't be shouting things out over there.

Number two. Number two. I would put number two as well. Andy put it at number two as well. I think this is a very very very very easy ranking for me.

That is ridiculous that we are that close to James Gun Superman. returns the week after that how scheduling works. I'm actually excited to watch Superman Returns again. Me too.
