I'm one of your hosts, Blessing Addio Jr. Joining me is Game Informers Wesley LeBlanc. Wesley, how's it going? Hello. Hello. Very excited to be here. I was just talking to you before the show. Uh, last time I was on the show, I was with you, which was awesome, but it was the day after I got laid off the first time at Game Informer. So, it's very cool to be here employed by Game Informer um and in good spirits. Uh stoked to be on the show. Thanks for having me. Yeah, I'd love to have you back in way better spirits than last time.

And like I know for me as somebody who's reading video game news every single day, right? Like I frequent Game Informer often. And then you also have people in the office that order the magazines, right? Like there's so much love for the outlet from our community since coming back to Game Informer. Like what's it been like? What's the vibe been? Well, it's one, it's just like it's still kind of hard to believe. We're we're about to ship our first issue this week um or next week and announce the cover story tomorrow.

And we are trying to push subscriptions. We want people to be able to get the best possible price cuz right now we're running like a a very limited time discount. Um, you can get a full year of issues for 48 bucks. Uh, which is more than our old price, but like not just for any reason. One, we're kind of a startup now. you know, we've been around for 34 years, but we have new owners. We are trying to do our own thing.

Um, we're going to have fewer ads on the website, exclusive features on the website. You get digital archive access to every single Game Informer issue we've ever released, which there's some like really cool stuff. Like we have an EA game that got cancelled right before the issue went live, which is a fascinating piece of history. Our Borderlands one cover is Borderlands before they went the whole cell-shaded route. So, you can see like the original art style. Um, there's a lot of history in there that I think is really cool.

And that's something we really wanted to push with this new era of Game Informer. And we're stoked we were able to make that happen. Oh yeah. Um, so we're we're announcing our cover tomorrow, which I can't say anything on right now, but it is an exciting cover. It's a big game. I think people are going to be really excited.

Uh, for me, my top three favorite games, number one, Final Fantasy 13, obviously the best Final Fantasy 13. Not a controversial take. No. Yeah, it's uh it was the first game I bought with my own money. It has like probably the best score in any video game ever. Like I truly I actually stand by that. for all the problems of 13, that musical score is top-notch. Um, and then I don't know, the other the other two games, it's hard not to be like kind of basic, but like Elden Ring, Breath of the Wild, Persona 5 Royal, some some [\u00a0__\u00a0] with all those answers.

It's like it's the same way that I love to rep Donkey Kong 64 or Jet Force Gemini. But like if you ask me what I think are the actual best games ever, it's I'm saying Breath of the Wild. I'm saying Mario 64. I'm saying GTA San Andreas, you know, the the regular picks that you that you would hear. Um before we before we get into the show proper, we were talking uh I I know you mentioned uh you were covering the Donkey Kong Bonanza Nintendo Direct this morning. Uh I want your quick thoughts like what did you think of the Direct? Is did this one get you more hyped for the game?

On the other hand, if someone is going to make a 3D platformer Donkey Kong game, I don't think you could give me a better answer than the Super Mario Odyssey team. So I was like little apprehensive, but excited nonetheless. After today's direct, I'm all in. Like, I am This game looks This looks so good. There was one point where he rolls and then jumps and then like does another jump after that and I was like, \"Oh, that's Super Mario Odyssey tech. I'm I'm in.

I know Tim Getty's he compares it to more of like a Wario land and like 3D as far as like how bulky it is he is and like how much he's moving through [\u00a0__\u00a0] I want to see more of those movement options and how that stuff develops over time cuz when I got to play it at the Switch 2 event in New York, right, like I didn't have it for long enough to where I could really like wrap my brain around, all right, how is Donkey Kong supposed to move? But when I think back to playing DK64, like even though that didn't control like a Mario, there was still those movement options that made that game feel like fun to play, right? The",

Yeah, it was a the when they first revealed the game, it was kind of like a weird showing. I don't I don't know. A lot of people, including myself, didn't really vibe with the art style and then they didn't show much. They were just like, \"You can break stuff.\" And it's like, \"Okay, that's not that exciting.\" I think if they were able to show a little bit more of what they showed in this direct, people would have been more excited, but like this direct really really sold it for me.

Um, and I'm most excited because of his thoughts on the game. He was kind of in the same boat as me where loved one and two, three was just not it. I don't for me it was like the humor of one and two maybe stayed with three and it didn't grow up with me and I just wasn't there for that anymore.

Like, the gameplay was still pretty good. It's It's Borderlands. It's a really solid uh looter shooter. It was just like, not to say what everyone else has said about it, but like the toilet humor, the like it's just too much of it. Too much stuff. Yeah.

And this is like when 3D printers were like first starting to become a bit more accessible, at least for certain groups of people, especially if you worked at the engineering school in U of I.

Yeah, I I think when they first I think the original reveal for Borderlands 4 did it a disservice cuz it was more of a cinematic reveal, but I think it gave people the impression that they were taking a larger step as far as changing the art style. And like I look at this and I'm like, it still looks like Borderlands, but also I don't really have much of an issue with it. Like it does. I I I I I think it's a battle that like is is is going to be tough for the studio cuz like the the Borderland style is so distinct and so established. I almost don't know how you do much more with it unless you completely revamp it, which I for me I think would turn it into a different thing.

I kind of was hoping, we had joked like internally at Game Informer when this got announced like what if cuz they needed a revamp. What if they just went back and finally did the art style that I mentioned earlier that was on our cover like the canceled Borderlands art style. If they did something like that, I kind of want to see that happen one day. But to your point, uh the art style is more than most games like really critical to Borderlands. Yeah, I don't I think it's because just when it came out that cell shading was so new and like unique to Borderlands that now it's kind of inseparable from the series.

Uh I do kind of hope to see them do some kind of revamp one day though. Yeah, I think for me as far as presentation wise, one of the things that stuck out to me during the last uh State of Play that they did uh was they were talking about this being um like a different planet. Like you're not on Pandora. You're in a different location. And I think for me the the biggest critique I'll give is that as I'm watching the gameplay, I would I would not have been able to tell you that this is a different location.

Um I think that's a good thing. Yeah. There's like other games where you are only not only but on alien planets often it differentiates itself really well like Destiny for example and other looter shooter even like the Halo games like I can look at screenshots and be like oh this is Halo 3 this is Halo 2 this is Halo 1 just by looking at the planet and how different it is and to your point with Borderlands that's kind of something that's tougher but I don't I don't know",

Otherwise, why go to a new planet if it's basically just Pandora? Yeah. The other thing I want to shout out from Paul Tacy's write up is later on in the ride up he mentions that like it it seems like there's two areas that have been significantly addressed. One of the areas being the riding that we're talking about, but then uh the other one seemingly to be the dramatic increase in mobility. And he says ranging from grappling hooks uh to gliding uh to make the combat feel more fast-paced and modern.

They showed you gliding from one point to to the next. And for me that's a huge thing like I want the game to feel more natural to play. You know I that goes back to the thing I said earlier as far as games change but Borderlands tends to stay the same. I think looking at what are the what are modern FPS games doing right? What are the best feeling FPS games right now? For me, I think of like 2019 when we got Apex Legends of how good that game feels in terms of movement, in terms of mantling, glide, uh, sliding, all these different things.

Like I'm also a big fan of the parries. Like put a parry in this game. Put like some dodge. Like I want to be fast and actionoriented. Yeah. But I'm also curious if like cuz there's got to be a step too far. I'm uh I'm thinking of like Halo Infinite right now. They did the Halo 3 like throwback playlist and the entire community is like this is amazing. There's no sprinting. There's no like mantling.

I just watched um No One Will Save You, that uh Alien movie with Caitlyn De and it's just her trying to not be killed by aliens. Like this doesn't have to be something as grand as the scope of Death Stranding. It's just in that world. So like give me like a haunted house with some BTS and someone who does not want to become a void and I'm there.

Like I I I I think if you're at a place of at PlayStation where you're you're not looking at Nintendo as being like as direct of a competitor as maybe they were once once upon a time, I could see the conversation being like, \"Yo, we just want to we want to make sure that this game by the studio that like we're partnered with does as well as it humanly can, does like as good as possible so that we're doing them justice",

And now that Switch 2 is out, like it's a known quantity. Sony can I I I would imagine pretty confidently be like, \"Okay, they're not directly competing with us.\" Like Switch 2 is continuing in its lane, which is a great lane for it, but like it's not trying to be this powerful piece of hardware that the PlayStation 5 is. So, like, it doesn't need to sweat it as much. So, why not bring a game like Stellerblade over? Yeah. And I'm also seeing a lot of people in chat mentioning that, yeah, Sony doesn't own Stellar Blade. Shift Up owns it. Sony only publishes Stellar Blade, which makes a lot of sense.
