Marathon is an extraction shooter coming from the of course famous and well-known development team of Bungie. I think a lot of people know Bungie from the early Halo days and most importantly probably their MMO experience with Destiny. So they're looking at a really acclaimed developer name going okay what's that new next thing as Destiny 2 continues to be what Destiny 2 is while also starting to slowly end and maybe ramp up for something different later on. But this is their next big game and a lot of people were excited.

And they chose an extraction shooter, which is a small kind of um interesting genre within the first person shooter genre. So, for me, I came out of it actually really enjoying Marathon on day one. Similar to what Andy said, it was more up my alley with more clashing and team engagements that felt similar to a battle royale style of intensity and gameplay cycles, but it was lacking in the extraction shooter momentto- moment gameplay, which is what we saw when they took a big right jab, I think, from Mark Raiders, right?

You could tell the audience feedback to Bungie, of course, the stolen assets and the reused uh arts as Andy and I covered in Games Daily.

And I know that's a crazy thing to say, but like you are getting out of the way of art creators at the end of October, which is clearly already eaten your lunch. And I am not trying to position myself and hey let's drop on February and have a month to two months of excitement and then just dive bomb die because of Grand Theft Auto.

All right, we're going to go to Games Radar Plus where Conser wrote, \"Morale at Bungie reportedly at an all-time low as the iconic FPS dev investigates stolen assets in Marathon. Quote, the vibes have never been worse.\" end quote. Morale at Bungie, the iconic first-person studio behind Destiny and the original Halo games, is reportedly at an all-time low with some employees unsure about whether their upcoming marathon reboot can meet its September release date. Obviously dated now. In case uh the scandal hasn't reached you yet, earlier this week, futuristic indie artist Fern Anti-real Hook accused the studio of using her 2017 art portfolio as inspiration, parenthesis, to put it mildly, for marathon without permission or payment. She also posted side-by-side",

She also posted side-by-side screenshots of her own artwork next to Marathon's alpha test with very similar iconography, patterns, fonts, and sometimes even words appearing in both. Bungie later admitted that a former artist at the studio had mistakenly quote included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in game end quote and said it was currently investigating a concern regarding unauthorized used of artists details unauthorized use of artist decals. A new Forbes report citing comments from former and current Bungie staff now gives some insight into what's happening inside the studio. Morale is said to be in a freefall, quote unquote, and the vibes have never been worse.

Game direct director Joe Ziggler even said the studio was quote still scrubbing out our assets uh to make sure all were being respectful to the situation. Uh which obviously sounds like a pretty hefty undertaking. For now, Bungie's legal team and parent company Sony are purportedly also investigating the situation. Though the fact the studio neglected to show gameplay footage in this week's live stream, of course, State of Play discussing the alpha maybe says enough. No, the state of the the live stream they were talking about was the they they had like their own and so that day was a very like oh man we got the elephant in the room is whole all of our [\u00a0__\u00a0] was stolen and every comment in the Twitch chat was art",

Guitar Hero Arrow super chated just like you can on youtube.com/kindfunny games and says, \"Keeping extraction focus is only delaying the same outcome.\" IMO needs a groundup refresh with the verse multiplayer suite and ideally a nostalgic solo campaign.

What is the way to change the fact that this is now the third time that we've had a headline on one of our shows that implies Bungie's [\u00a0__\u00a0] up and that we don't know if they can fix it.

PlayStation had Hell Divers last year. They had this mega win uh on this side of gaming to an extent. They also had Concord, which we understand was maybe the biggest failure in video game history. Like that is going to be something that we talk about forever and to this day is unbelievable to me. I can't believe they actually pulled that game as quickly as they did. So, to look here, it's like, how do you solve this? Because we all sat and we looked at uh Suicide Squad and we looked at Concord and going into it, we're all like, I don't know. I don't know.

Mike was backing this up too, like there's something here and I believe that. I totally do. I think that yes, like kind of restart this game, there is potential for marathon, a Bungie marathon that is not just on PlayStation 5, but it's also on PC and also on Xbox and it is crossplay that can succeed for sure.

The future of Marathon over the last month or so feels rather unsteady, but in a new SIE presentation, Sony is reinforcing that it's an important game in its lineup and projecting confidence. Sony's Herman Holse took some time during his overview of PlayStation's offerings to single Marathon out as quote an innovative and bold take on the extraction shooter genre. End quote.

End quote. For starters, we're back to Paul of course. At least the presentation reinforces a window of marathon fiscal year 2025 in a time that most players believe it will be delayed out of its current September 23 25 release date. Fiscal year 25 ends March 2026. So it would not be something huge like a year delay. Even 6 months is pushing it. So if there is one, it would not be all that long. And you would wonder uh what might be able to be changed or fixed in that time. This leads to the next aspect of this. This supposed quote strong engagement end quote.

So yes, there was quote unquote engagement. Either Sony is completely divorced from the online conversation surrounding Marathon or they see where things are headed and feel forced to project strength regardless. Saying nothing about Marathon or waffling on it here would do nothing to help them or the game. So of course, yes, you say you believe in the game, even if you're dancing around what's actually happening by bragging about engagement.

Destiny, no one's acknowledging that was great. A lot of people, a lot of people come after me and Paul Tassy says it well. It's like Destiny 2 has had its time in the sun and is slowly ramping down.

Like you could make a a horror gore movie a bit funnier, but it's still a horror gore movie that like if that's not your jazz, you're not going to be into that. Um, and I don't think that there's any tweaks you can do here. This isn't a this isn't a multiplayer game with",

For me, it's like the what you have here is the Destiny and Bungie fan base that are going to be sort of the main people that are going to be excited about the next Destiny Bungie or or Bungie pro uh project. And so much about Destiny is player agency. It's that's my guardian. That I I that that's my dude. I customize him the way I want.

Greg Miller, I've never played an extraction shooter. his first 20 experiences should never see another player because if he does, he's going to get run over to the point where it's like, well, he didn't extract any items. He didn't learn about the game mechanics. He has no idea what's happening. Boom. The PVE PVP genre is like you're making that bubble and you're taking it even smaller. And I think for an audience like Sony in particular, Bungie with what they've built off of Destiny, they're not looking for a diehard PVP experience right now.

Like that's so many people. And surely when we look at um I know you can't just like compare apples to oranges, but when we look at um um um Obsidian ah yes or or you know some",

You know that that is possible. You don't need 850 people working on some and clearly some of those people were being moved to the Marathon project or you know these people are kind of like floating between two different divisions or whatever but it it's just so wild to me that there are not only that many employees at Bungie that continue to you know seemingly get laid off but to think of the possibility of holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] we could have had a smaller team hundred or 200 people working on a single player thing that does not need to doesn't need to be the forever game.

See, I'm I'm in an interesting phase of like I'm not mad at the vision and the idea, right? Like coming from the Xbox side of things, you see live service games that are doing well, right? But there's a certain kind of style to that live service game. And there's also years of like, you remember Sea of Thieves at launch? Guess what? We're like seven years into Sea of Thieves.

Okay, what can we do over here?\" And I think they just missed the mark of what their audience wanted. And it speaks with Hell Divers. Hell Divers is a PVE experience. There is no Timmy and Tommy's hunting you down. Hell Divers, I've believed since the beginning would not have been as big as it is if it was PvP or had a PvP element, right?

We also have to remember that some of these titles take years to really find an audience and stay relevant. And it's not cash cow day one, right? You see it these releases today. It doesn't last. And but but to that point too, and I I love that you're bringing this up because like we should remember that seven years ago or whatever it was when Rare announced Sea of Thieves, we were like this isn't what we want from Rare, you know, like even that was a thing of this same conversation applied back then.

I am giving you $12 to $20 a month. There's no reason why some of these titles aren't doing that, right? And PlayStation, it seems to be adverse to some of this. I don't get the vibe of PlayStation like a game pass of like, hey, here's my here's a great one for you. Um, Ninja Theory made a game called Bleeding Edge, which just died right away. That was a Team Arena game, and Ninja Theory made that, and guess what they did? put it on Game Pass and it lived a lot longer than Concord and this game over here with Marathon.

You can explain to me if it's not a full purchase, but like having Bungie in the lineup and saying like, \"Hey, let's make more Destiny. That's the golden goose. You do that.\" But everything else, look at what your market wants. Hell divers was a success because it was a PvE. Make that. But in Sony Worlds, we don't need",

You need to be engrossed in this ecosystem. Like I I it's crazy you listing off that massive amount of games that are all trying to do the same thing, which is retain a player for as long as possible.
