I'm joined today by blessing at YoYay Jr. Good day, Tim. Andy Cortez. Hello. And making his return to the kind of funny stage. It's Snowike Mike wearing a glittery sweater. I like this a lot. I'm a Galaxy Defender. He's a Galaxy Defender. Galaxy Defender. Tim, I'm back. Hello everyone. I've missed you. Turn around and show the back of it. So, I want to give it to Tim. I got it. Tim, we're good. I like that a lot. Mike, how you been? You've been gone the the last two weeks essentially. You were out in Florida going to every theme park imaginable. Uh yeah, every theme park imaginable. Had an incredible experience. Tim, cannot wait to tell you all the stories. I was ripping and I was rocking. Uh came back, got the crud. You know what I mean?

But I'm back now after a week of being sick. And I missed you guys. I missed the Switch 2 launch. Very uptight about that. I missed out on the big or Switch 2 sleepover event. Uptight about that. And I missed out on Jeff Keley showcase with all of you, right? which I saw a lot of games that really spoke to me. Tim, I had a lot of fun. Give me the the the the real quick snow bike mic rundown of the PlayStation State of Play and the Xbox or and the um summer gamefest showcase. What are the highlights?

Now, Game of Thrones has a track record of a lot of mobile looking video games, but I'm in for that one, Tim. Also, that Chrono Medieval bad title, but awesome idea. Yeah. Of like, hey, is this Total War or is this going to be like a weird mountain blade or a chivalry type video game? I'm in for that. And so, a lot of games I took from Jeff Keely's, wrote them down. I'm into uh there's that Capture the Flag game. Yeah, we don't put enough love on capture the flag games anymore. Okay, I don't know if you guys know. We kind of put that to the side.

Not since Halo Halo Infinite. Not since Halo was on. Yeah, it was definitely Halo Infinite for sure. Halo Infinite for sure. Oh my god, those that like week was glorious. The best time. One week of Halo Infinite. Underrated video game. I'll still say it. Hell yeah. Oh, fantastic. Everyone, we're reacting to the Xbox showcase. In 24 minutes, it will start. Uh I don't know how long it's going to be. I imagine it'll be around 2 hours or so. About 2 hours. Say that maybe.

I feel like there's not been as many rumor rumors and like rumblings of what's going to be here aside from maybe a Persona 4 remake situation and honestly if I get that then I'm happy and so I'm excited to possibly see that. Aside from that I'm also excited to see what Xbox has for the future right for a publisher that has so many studios and like you know publishers that are under the big publisher. I feel like we're going into this expecting any and everything and so I'm excited. Yeah. Mike, what are you interested in here? Uh Tim, I'm interested in a lot of things. I think there's a lot of knowns. There's not many unknowns. Bless. I know they have a lot of studios, but it feels like we've gotten a tease of a lot of what the studios are",

And it is the back half of the year. What are we solidifying the back half of the year to say, \"Hey, Xbox had another great year because I just had a really good one. We've had a strong first half. Let's see if they can keep that momentum, complete a full two years, and let's keep that going. And so, you have Outer Worlds 2 dated or slated for the second half, right? You know, there's a Call of Duty somewhere in the mix. You'll probably get some game updates, but like, is there one more game that I'm missing out of my head that should be planted right there?

There's just there there are so many dominoes that we know are about to fall and the the bomb is going to play and the the titles that I'm really really excited about are the ones that I'm hoping to see make a return and I talked about it on our games cast prediction where I really hope that we get to see some sort of return of Ever Wild and what that new sort of you know what the new I guess mentality is with what the game is going to be and again I would have assumed the game is dead but in in that February interview, Phil Spencer saying it's looking really great and I'm super stoked with what they're working on. I don't think he mentions it if it doesn't if he isn't really excited about. I think that's one that if you know you're",

I think that's one that if you know you're going to kill it, you don't say it all and you just pretend it's already dead sort of deal. So, I'm excited for that. Um, what about Contraband? What about um Gears of War Eday? Like those are things that I want to see gameplay of. I want to see Eay, especially uh especially as a as a latecomer to to the Gears of War franchise. Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm hyped for this one. I feel like uh of the the known showcases this year. I guess even the the unknown at the time of the PlayStation State of Play, like this is the one that I think I'm most excited for because it has the most potential and the the most room for it's I don't think it's going to bring every single one of the things we want to see here, but it's going to bring at least a couple just because there are so many teams at play here and",

I want to see uh how much support that ends up getting here. If the time for the third party kind of uh devkit roll out second phase of switch stuff is going to start now, which I'd be hopeful for. Uh but beyond that, I am interested, Mike, to talk to you about the rest of this year here because yeah, it's been an amazing first half of the year in terms of u its releases. We're we're continuing that out. Again, Xbox now means so many different things. We still have um Tony Hawk in just a couple weeks, right? We know Gears of War Eday coming later in in the year. Outer uh Worlds 2 at some point. Like that already seems like there are games like what what is",

That is your big temple title for the end of the year, right? Tony Hawk is in there. We know a Call of Duty will probably be in here. There's no way it's getting off cycle. But out of the games that was shown at the Xbox developer director or whatever we call those, those are that's still the one game missing out. Ninja 4. Oh my god, that's incredibly exciting. We'll look for hopefully some DLC updates, maybe some Starfield DLC, maybe Indiana Jones DLC. For sure Indiana Jones and so those will kind of round out your year, but is there one big title that will come out and surprise? I don't know. I'm kind of putting my expectations, Andy, more at the medium range. I think Aaron Greenberg has",

Like we've seen a lot from Xbox these past two summers. I think you kind of know the road map here. It's more what is that one surprise this year that would make it big for me. I I I might have misspoke a second ago. I I forgot, but I meant to say the Gears of War remake, not Gears of War Eday. Do you guys think Gears of War Eday is here? And if it is, do you think it's this year? No. No, I don't think it comes out this year, but I think we see I would love to see a little snippet of gameplay, but there's also part of me that wonders, you know, I predicted that we will not see Fable here because it's going to be the big post Xbox conference thing next",

I don't know. I don't think it comes out this I don't think Eay comes out this year, but I would love to see a gameplay snippet. My thing is I'm with you. I think it's Fable next year. I don't think that Gears of War Eday needs a direct like that. You know, I feel like that is a in the showcase, we can do get all the information across. I feel like you start to get a little long in the tooth if you're breaking down the modes too much and getting too into the nitty-gritty of a Gears of War game. But Call of Duty got one, didn't they? Yeah, they did. But that was the only big title of the year last year. Yeah. Yeah. For that back half. I Yeah, that is interesting. I",

And I feel like the it being the first like Xbox presented uh Call of Duty, I think that that kind of like changes that a little bit. Um and also we didn't have a dedicated Call of Duty event last year in the way that we had previously, right? Um but yeah, Fable I think really needs that let's take the time, let's introduce the team, let's get into the the nitty-gritty. Do you guys both think or do you guys think that Eay and Fable are both second half of next year? Because I think that's a big factor as well is like the placement of this of these things. Fable, I believe, was originally coming out this year. correct me if I'm wrong, and then got delayed next year. Um, so like I could see that maybe being a you know, April May release. So you got to",

So you will not be putting those in that stratosphere. Correct. Bless. So yeah, I don't think you do that unless it's very early in that January February slot to try to get it going before that May takeover. So yeah, I don't think you put the two big dogs out there to try to battle GTA 6 anytime. Fable feels like a post GTA 6 and Gears feels like a pre GTA 6 to me. I could I could see Gears being March. When did Doom come out this year? Was that March or April? That was May. Oh, that was Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] Yeah. I mean, the thing about Way longer.

Like you don't want to just totally kill any interest in in people playing that game 3 weeks into the release. I think because of how long we've known about Fable and also kind of just where the chess pieces lay, I would expect Fable to come out before Gears of War Eday. So, I'm more likely on us seeing Gears of War Eday as the post uh summer showcase direct sort of situation. That said, I think no matter what, like I'll still expect a trailer here, right? Like something small, something quick, maybe a quick glimpse at gameplay and then you let next year be your big breakdown of everything that's new for Eay. Um I think that could be exciting.

Here's something story related, maybe something small, then next year we give you the blowout. So I I don't expect much Gears E day, but I do expect it here. Yes. Mike, in your heart, what's it telling you about Halo? Uh Halo's on a long road, Tim. I do not think that we will have something Halo of substance here. Um I don't even think you'll get anything Halo Infinite, right? And I thought last year we talked about it of like, man, we got to see something for Halo Infinite. Let's do this. Splitgate got a battle royale before Halo did. That one really hurts me deep down inside. And so, yeah, I don't think we see anything Halo Infinite related. Halo next from Halo Studios.

We've talked about that with Paris on former XCast episodes of like what do you do for that? How do you make that big? I think you look at Halo, of course, Gears is getting that kind of remastered treatment now coming to different platforms. We've already gotten it on Xbox, but Halo, Gears, you also look at uh Fallout with Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 3 and go, \"Hey, how do we make these anniversaries, these TV shows having a premiere, something big? We know the fans want that.\" And so, yeah, how do you land that for a Halo? I don't know.

Um, only if it's like, hey, we're releasing Master Chief Collection for the Switch and PlayStation 5. I don't think we see anything Halo Studios related. We saw it already very early on. Hey, we're working on Unreal. We're going to see what we can do. We're building out this foundry of different items that people can come in, look at, replicate, and use inside of our next building blocks of the game, but I don't think I mean, we'd be looking at that essentially, right? We wouldn't even be looking at the game in my mind. So, I I think we're far off from Halo proper here at Xbox. And they don't need that this year. They have a lot of other things going on.

I just had my hand hand up against the wall. I'm just like, why don't we have a Halo Hell Diver still? And that just seems like, you know, Hell Diver is not on Xbox and not something you can get right now. That experience is being missed. [Music] Can we possibly see anything like that that isn't I know Halo Studios I think is probably like what Tim was mentioning working on a Halo 1 remake of some sort in Unreal Engine 5. We're using all this. Will we see anything like that? Do we see Halo try to go after a certain genre? Is that something that could be implemented into Infinite's multiplayer?

That was their twin stick shooter reminiscent of old uh hell divers. But yes, Andy, there should be more people playing in the Halo sandboxes we talked about before. That's how we got Halo Wars and we loved that RTS strategy game. That was a ton of fun. We saw Gears make Gears Tactics and that was really great. I do think we should get an ODST type smaller campaign type own gameplay. I don't know if they have anyone around them that you can point out and say make that right because I would go to IDsaw. I would go to ID. I would go to the people who make I mean Wolfenstein and um Doom. You'd go to those guys and say, \"Hey, you're that first up on the first person shooter game.

Certain affinity would be another team I would have called and said, \"Hey, make this.\" And we know that didn't quite work out as we switched over to Unreal 5. So, Andy, yes, we should get more in Halo. No, we're not getting that right now. What about Perfect Dark? God, I hope we kind of need to, right? And the thing is we need to and I don't know that we will like it. We get the game announced, it's forever for it to to come back and then last year we get the like gameplay demo. They showed a snippet. Yeah. So, if they were to not have it this year, I think that that'd be a very interesting move. But is it time to show it though?

The only positive for Perfect Dark for me out of this outcome is Perfect Dark is that fall game is that far oh my god they're making 2025 that would be exciting cuz yeah we've already seen Perfect Dark. We kind of we've seen the gameplay of it. The only thing you can do now is show more gameplay and of course say hey 2026 we know that and I think most people out there know with us of like that's probably where this is going to land. But the only positive for me coming out of a perfect dark more reveal is hey somehow we've landed in 2025 we're going to make your fall a little bit better. The only thing that leads me to believe they might actually show it here is Xbox has been I think really good at in the last in this era",

The team has done incredible work bringing The Outer Worlds 2 to life and we can't wait for you to play it.

The events of Grounded 2 take place two years after the first game. The same four teenagers are returning. So there's Max, Hoops, Willow, and Pete.

Ground is a survival game that I would encourage a lot of people to go check out if you're tempted to jump into the genre because they do a good job of morphing a story that will keep you going from point A to point B while still giving you the hey you could sit here all day in one spot and build the ultimate castle if you wanted to.

I think Game Pass also helps that of not having a $40 price tag on a survival game we might not ever play again, right? That game pass goes all these toxic chemicals underground.

We didn't just want it to look better. We also knew we wanted to add a new layer of strategy. The changes that we've made aren't limited to tuning animations or adjusting attack or defense numbers or making characters or insects move faster or slower. But we did all that, too. But there's also an entire sort of rock paper scissors strategy involving light attacks, heavy attacks, and blocking. We've also added dashing as a new way to both get out of danger quickly or jump in for a quick attack. And almost all the insects in the game will have these abilities now, too.

We're leaning into clear play styles for tanky warriors, low defense, high damage rogues, effect wielding mages, and ranged hunters. In the first Grounded, we have mutations, and there were weapons and armors that favor different play styles. In Grounded 2, not only will there be passive mutations, but there will also be active mutations. And a lot of those mutations support these archetypes. My favorite way to play pretty much any game is chasing after those game-breaking builds. And that's why I'm so excited for what we're doing with archetypes in Grounded 2. I'm all in on the rogue.

It's high risk, high reward, and absolute chaos in all the best way. I'm looking forward to seeing what wild combos the community comes up with and what they inevitably break once they get their hands on the archetype system. It's going to be awesome watching it evolve with player feedback and watching us try to keep up with all of your gamebreaking builds. One of the great things about Grounded is the variety of players it attracts. From builders to crafters and everything in between.

It was really, really important for us to deliver on all of that for the bigger space and experience because that was the only way we could truly support the feature the community has been asking for since the very first grounded release.

Just like how we wanted to expand on player play styles throughout the game, we're going to make sure that every buggy that we add has its own personality.
