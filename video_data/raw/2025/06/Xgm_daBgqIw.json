            "text": "[Music] What is up everybody and welcome to a very special kind of funny games cast. It's finally happened. I had the pleasure of sitting down with one of the most talented vocalists and musicians working today, Caroline Pichek. My fiance introduced me to her music in 2019 with Caroline's first solo album, Pang. And since then, I don't think one week has passed without me listening to a Caroline song. Her music means the world to me, and it was so exciting to get the chance to sit down with her and chat. Caroline is joining me on the games cast because her and producer Danielle Harl have created the title song for Death Stranding 2 entitled On the Beach. But more importantly to the context of this podcast and show and kind of funny as a whole, this all happened because I gave Hideo Kojima a copy of her latest album, Desire Want to Turn into You. And it kicked off a chain of events that I still cannot fully believe. No, that's not a joke. I gave Cojima her album, he listened to it, and",

I gave Cojima her album, he listened to it, and then he fasttracked the creation of a song with her to become the title track of Death Stranding 2. Wild. So Caroline and I break down the insanity of that, what it's like working with Hideo, making music as a nonvideo gamer in a video game. And of course, I got to ask her about her next album. It's a conversation that even if you're not a fan of hers yet, I think you're going to really enjoy it. Thank you to our sponsor, Shady Race, our Patreon producers, Carl Jacobs, Omega Buster, and Delaney Twining. But without further ado, here's my first ever conversation with the great Caroline Pachch.

And while we were there, we had the amazing opportunity of actually going to Cojima Productions. Uh, so that was incredible. Uh, so the in there and the reason that that actually happened was Cojima uh is friends with Greg uh the founder of this company and he was able to get Cojima to record the intro to our studio the spare bedroom uh when we launched it in October.

So, our idea was to kind of put them on, right? To to to find our favorite things, our favorite movies, our favorite books, what have you. And we each chose all 11 of us at the company chose one piece of media, right? So, uh Blessing chose the Challengers, uh DVD, so he was very excited. Kajjima was very excited about that.

That is uh the dream job that I have right here where I get to talk about video games all day and uh moved across the country and then Desire came out and we saw you live at Terminal 5 and we saw you live in uh San Francisco. So it was it's an album and your music just means a lot to us. So uh I absolutely as soon as I had this opportunity I was like, \"Yep, get in Desire and I know that I know he's going to love it.\" But like I would talk to people and I would be like, \"Okay, like pie in the sky.

So that was that's your album right at the top. We made sure we we we stacked the deck the deck in your favor. We made sure to put your album at the top. uh because Lanza was putting it together and he looks at your album but he kind of goes through everything, right? And he's like not really like, you know, his eyes aren't peeking at anything other than kind of the uh the Challengers DVD, but then at the ending of Yeah, he gets excited right there.

He would love this album. And he looks at it as you're seeing right now. He kind of shakes his head and kind of puts it aside, right? Just moves on. And I'm like okay that's it. That's the end of it. I I shot my shot. We'll see what happens. And then I swear to God, Caroline, the next [\u00a0__\u00a0] day, the next day, he posts on his Instagram uh a picture of him listening to Sunset.

I mean, it was very aesthetically formative, but um but I love watching like playthroughs of games and also just watching essentially watching my boyfriend play them because I I'm really interested in sort of the conceptual arc of video games and obviously Kojima is the the guy when it comes to that. He's the guy when it comes to really like sixth wall breaking level storytelling. So, I've been following him on Twitter for years despite not having ever actually played through any of his games myself. So, it was a huge deal to me when he posted Sunset.

Um, but as we as we know, actually, that's not really where his taste lies. But, um, but yeah, that blew my mind when he posted Sunset. And then from there, as you said, it snowballed. It was like every day he was posting Sunset for a while. And then he started listening to other songs and the other album and then I was like I got to shoot my shot here and DM didn't get a response back and then my management sort of went to went the professional. I mean fair enough he's got a lot to do. He's a busy man but um then my people talked to his people and then suddenly I was on on Zoom with him and his whole team very officially and they pitched this to me. So okay so that's the question that I have right there. I've seen a lot of the images of him with people on Zoom, right? And",

And the pitch was actually a different one and I it's not as interest I don't I I don't I can't talk about it but the pitch evolved into what this became. Was it for Death Stranding that original pitch? Yes. Okay. It was Yeah. Um, and yeah, the pitch evolved. There were a couple songs in contention, some of which already existed. And then this is the piece of music that ended up in now being called On the Beach was actually one of the first songs I ever made with producer and and composer Danielle Harl.

We were snowed in and we pulled almost an allnighter working out of his friend's apartment and made this really scary piece of music. And I love it, but it was just too industrial and fraught, I guess, for for paying, which is the album we were making at the time. So, I I knew I said this, let's save this for something really special cuz I love this music. It's too intense. It's too scary actually for um for the storytelling on this album.

And he heard it and immediately was like, let's do it. and he sends me the 60-page synopsis of Death Stranding 2 and asks me to read it and asks me, \"We would like you to incorporate as many strands of this as you can um but in a way that people won't be able to read immediately, but people who have played the game will understand.\" And I said, \"Sensei, you've come to the right person.\" and he has a co-writing credit on that song because of all his ideas that have now ended up woven through the lyrics.

Um, and the Japanese have their own version of that tale where when you die, you know, instead of seeing a white light or going to the river sticks, you go to something called the river Sanzu.

There was all just amazing things I got presented with and I just felt like a kid in a candy shop and said yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And then weirdly they all sort of came out much much later in really tight succession. So this era wasn't actually planned but it's quite fun to have it all just be like a yeah sort of pi\u00f1ata of different of different things that I've made over the last year all coming out at the same time. Yeah. You never know where Caroline's going to be.

Uh being a perpetual novice, uh you know, always trying to find the ways to be a student, uh always trying to learn. What about working with Cojima, working in uh games has brought up that feeling of being a perpetual novice? That's such a cool connection. So, have you seen that that scene in the Death Stranding trailer when all the sort of shrouded bodies approach the plgate? Yeah. I feel like that when I'm entering the video game space where I feel like I know absolutely nothing.

And then two, another side question, but connected to this, uh do you have an album, a song, a music video that you would recommend to them of like, hey, this is this is me encapsulated. I know that that's a big thing to ask, but do you do you have one or two things? Um, I love all this. First of all, what's up, guys? If any of you are new to me, I'm Caroline Pichek.

But, um, but yeah, it's been really really cool preparing this song to come out, knowing that it's going to be for people who have no idea about anything I've made before. and and um and it's really exciting cuz the song really feels like its own world and maybe that means that these new listeners will like my music, the rest of my music and maybe it means they won't. And both of those things are okay to me actually. But um so when you ask for a recommendation for people, you mean of my own music or Okay. Yeah. of your own music. Yeah.

I looked at Leans and my fiance and I said, \"How the [\u00a0__\u00a0] does she not lose her voice every single night?\" Like I like what is that like? Do you have an extreme ritual for that or is it like what what does that look like for you? You know what's really counterintuitive about uh maybe it's maybe it's my voice, maybe it's everyone's voices, but actually the high stuff isn't what kills my voice. It's talking.

And from that came the idea of this um yeah the music video and and like you said humor is sort of woven throughout. And I guess I don't know how else to describe it. I just think humor is a great way of dealing with chaos. Um, and dealing with things that don't match. And both of those are things that Cojima is always, you know, approaching as well kind of conceptually is like in a world where things are chaotic and disjointed and disaled.

I was just so aruck by these worlds and and the fact is when you get presented with uh uh visuals like that.

And that to me, not just as a teenager, but through my whole life, has been so important to me. Um, is so like seductive and so interesting and rich. Um, you know, how pop culture is a way for people to meet each other and find each other and and have really profound things in common. So, for me, the the visuals are like a shorthand of expressing all these things. Um, and it and it changes not just how I want other people to hear the music, but it changes how I imagine it even as I'm making it.

[Music] and I had so many things stored up that I wanted to do and forced them all into one video and and I'm not sure they all should have gone together um but we made them fit. But at the time um partially because of the pandemic I was living out of a of a storage facility.

And every time I would go in there, I just think this place looks so awesome, even as much as it was like my own personal hell.

And and I was thinking about how all these these things like the color red and the the flag of the bull and the color red are all kind of synced up with that idea of like vitality and coming out of the pandemic that felt like what we all needed. We all needed like really bodied physical energy. Yeah. And then the third big piece of the puzzle here was sort of connecting the two in the myth of Thesus and the Minotaur, which is a Greek a Greek myth about this maze underground and the Thesius goes in and slays this bull bull man um who's been taking all the maidens hostage and and I",

And like I like I said, there's too many ideas here. And it was post pandemic and I was so excited to shoot. But more than anything, I was excited to take this and make it physical because we'd all become so virtual during the pandemic. And that was actually a big part of the aesthetics of my first album, Pang, was taking these mythological storybook, you know, almost Hans Christian Anderson uh feelings and and compressing them into a really tight digital system of of images and and um ephemera.

We built the box in a we built the box maze, which was insanely expensive. Um thank you Facebook for paying for that. Oh, and um and and the choreography was insane because I had to rehearse without the boxes. We had to tape off the floor of this dance studio and I had to learn to navigate it backwards. Anyway, I could go on and on and forever about that video, but this is just a little glimpse into how these separate ideas meet each other in these little strange bridges and then and then the song kind of is all part of it.

But, um, no, I like to allow myself the freedom of like, how do I connect this song to the rest of the record using visuals? So, the rest of record has to be done.

Um so you have very much like melded this both of your projects together into this one big world. Uh, I want to talk about that like what is that? Why why is it so important to connect both of these things? Because I think some artists tend to do the opposite, right? Where it's like this is one era, this is another era. Clean break and we're not going to look backwards. Like why is it so important to look backwards? Cuz I think it's fascinated. I'm the same person.

And also just another side note, like if Cojima ever wants to scan you and put you in the game, like are you down for that? Like like would you I um you know when it comes to video game music I realize that I'm sort of standing at the precipice of a giant cliff which is AI where you know what does video game music want? It wants infinitely generative audio and we're getting to processor speeds now where that's it's going to be possible in 5 minutes.

Um, you know, even when I was working with Kojima on the scene where my song goes, we had to think about that because if uh if players are moving really fast through my scene, they're not going to hear the whole song. And um that's just how it has to be programmed. But I think we're right on the edge of these things being a lot more elastic and and generative and um so I kind of just want to sit back and watch where things go.
