Everybody mark your calendars. It's only 28 days to Tim's birthday. Blessing Eddie Ooey Jr. Good day, Tim and Andy Cortez. Good day, Tim. Good day to you all as well. Good week to you all. We are kicking off. Are we sitting in the wrong spot? We are. We wanted to see if we can figure it out. I sat down. So funny. Yeah. I was like, that's um weird. I'm over here. And then Andy sat down. He said, \"Greg's usually next to me.\" And then I was like, \"Well, it's Barrett's fault.\" And then Barrett tried to pass the buck to me. I'm like, \"You're in charge.\" You are in charge. It's your laptop. Just letting you know you're the director. If you're not directing people, what are you doing in there? You want me to move your laptop? I mean, if you want me to go over there, it's whatever. I don't know. You throw bless off his game. Look",
