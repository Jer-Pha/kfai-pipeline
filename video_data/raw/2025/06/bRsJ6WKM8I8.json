I it's it's so funny cuz I when I saw the trailer they did before they they were even calling it Riftbound. I saw it and I was like I I I need to know more about this. It looked like Magic the Gathering but like with some flare to it. And the thing me and Mike have been trying to figure out is how we make more card game content.

I'm not going to go into super detail, but like when I when they sat us all down, it was me and a bunch of media people and then also a bunch of Riot people as well in a room. They did a slideshow. They talked to us all about their plans for like release the they're doing like a staggered thing where it comes out in China first and then later on it comes out in English speaking territories.

There's no solo magic play, right? Oh. Oh, no. Like single player? No, no, no, no. I think when they say multiplayer, they mean like four more than two essentially. Yeah. Um, but yeah, got to do that. um saw some like recognizable people from like the board game community and got to like play with them which is cool. I met um this person named Voxy who's been on Tallarian Community College. You wouldn't know about that too. I don't know about that you know all about it.

But it's very unique in the sense that like it's more movement based and so you have battlefields in the middle and like you can move your cards to the battlefield. I mean, dude, they were really excited. I I got excited from how excited they were talking about this game because they're like, \"Yeah, we got different formats and like this ain't official yet, but we want to do a 5v5 format that's essentially like League of Legends where you have like two 2v2s happening and then a 1v one in the middle, which I think is a jungle thing.

But Mike, to to boil it all down, I'm super duper excited for Riftbound after playing it. And also for me as somebody who's trying to get into like 2x KO and also like somebody I liked Arcane as well and now I'm finding more avenues into League of Legends which without actually having to play League of Legends which is great for me. Um so yeah, I'm very excited about Riftbound and yeah, they gave us the opportunity to reveal uh two cards. And this ain't a sponsorship. This is just a this is a thing they do with creators in the TC TCG space. They're like big Mike coming in. Big Mike coming in. They're like, \"Hey, we got cards to reveal.

And so I want you here because we're about to reveal two new Riftbound cards and you're the League of Legends guy. What an honor. What What an awesome honor you get to be blessed. This is sick. Yeah. Barrett, if you can bring them up. So this first one, Mike, can you tell us about Sona? Oh, Sona. Uh, actually, this is my support character. Uh, it's funny enough, you showed me uh in or you showed me some of the heroes and there's Leona and then there's Sona. Uh, I rock Sona a lot. I think it's a great intro beginner character to bot lane if you want to be a support character. Sona is known for her heals, her abilities to buff up the team whenever needed and then also a big-time stun ability on the opposite team. And so that's what I would be looking for",

Let's see. While I'm at the battlefield ready for friendly runes at the ready at the end of your turn. So essentially like you're untapping mana to put it into like our our terms, right? Once you get into a battlefield, like I mentioned earlier, it's like more location based. So you put your cards on the battlefield to face off against the other players cards. And if you're dominating the battlefield, that's how you score points in the game. And so that's pretty cool. Um, now Barrett, if you can bring us the next card, Shen. Are you familiar with Shen?

It's really cool, Bless, when you showed me these cards and you named off some of the heroes that we went through or the champions in League of Legends style. Uh it made me smile because there's a lot of old school ones. Remember, there's 150 plus. So, you know, Tim, we're pretty deep into the lore of League of Legends and the whole world of Rune Terra. Uh and so, yeah, it is awesome to see a lot of older collections get mentioned in here because that's where I'm at of like that 2013 to 18 era is my heavy League of Legends world.

The CEO went on to reference how Sony's console business has evolved into a multiaceted platform with a significant portion of its 124 million monthly active users still playing on PlayStation 4. Quote, \"We now have a large ecosystem of highly engaged players across both the PS5 and the PS4 generations. So naturally, therefore, there's a huge interest in our next generation console strategy.\" He said, quote, \"While while we cannot share further details at this stage, the future of the platform is top of mind. We are committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with our content and services.\" End quote. Azar again emphasized the point that Sony's players are now engaged across multiple platforms including PS4, PS5, and PC, and noted that the vast majority of his revenue now comes from subscriptions in microtransactions, which should provide protection during any future platform migration.

I think for these types of games, early access seems to be more and more standardized.
