You know, I've been on the record for many years on podcast, if you'll get me there, talking about of how much damage this movie did to generations of fans to make Superman the most boring [\u00a0__\u00a0] on earth. You know what I mean? He's he's too powerful. He can rewind time. What are we talking? You know what I mean? Like there the thing again, we're talking about it from a film making perspective at 78 and how amazing the effects are and what they did there and how great it is. But also, I love miniature work. You watch those original Star Wars, there's something about that that looks so much better than we're watching whatever shitty alien it is with the [\u00a0__\u00a0] horrible rotoscope 3. You know what I mean? Like, I like this. I'd rather it look dated this way than that way. Um, but I think one of the big things from that moment in time that's so interesting and always",

Why do you like him?\" And I have to be like, listen, like your impression is based on what he was in the golden age of superheroes, right? Like it starts June 1938, right? Why does it start June 1938, Tim? Good question. You don't know? No, it starts June 1938, even though it's not the actual issue they're opening because of course that's the dated date of Action Comics number one. Okay. Action Comics number one actually, of course, came out April 1938. Uh but it was dated uh 38 on the actual comic itself.

As me a modern Superman fan, right, the only the Superman I really knew, right, when I'm not a kid watching this movie, but the kid collecting comic books and reading, right, is post Crisis Crisis on Infinite Earths. It was a giant DC comics event that came together and took the infinite earths of DC comics and condensed them to one and gave us a Superman that is probably far more the Superman you know from Smallville or Lois Lois and Clark or even the Lois and Superman and Lois the the one they just did with Tyler Hawklin. I can't get the name off my head. You know what I'm saying though? Um a modern Superman that isn't the most powerful person in the world that is is a person that's more Clark Kent, right?

I as a person who has watched this and read so much and done all this different stuff, right? I look at this movie and I'm always in a way so depressed by it of the fact that Superman is Superman and comes back to Metropolis and has to act like Steve Urkel. Like it's really what a shitty existence for this guy. And I I know that I'm taking a comic book movie even though it's an elevated way too seriously as I enter into this. But it's like I am always like I just I feel so bad for him having to fake who he is.

And again, it would never take away from the amazing performance of Christopher Ree here of being able to be Clark Kent and be that in in a moment change into Superman and you watch and you go, \"Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] that is two different things.\" Like that's incredible. But in terms of my take on this movie and my feelings about this movie, obviously I adore it. Obviously I grew up on it. It's an interesting one of like obviously we owned it but the memory for me is always going to the gas station at the corner which was Super America where they had a movie section in the back when you could rent stuff from",

So, one Superman, next one, two, three, you know, every weekend out it. And I I this is a fun one. You remember Benjamin Cooper? It was a place downtown San San Francisco uh oyster cocktail spot. It's out of business now. It didn't survive COVID. Rest in peace. But there was this really bizarre moment for me where it was like in a hotel or attached to a hotel. So, you had to go through the hotel lobby to get to the bathroom. And I was coming back from the bathroom a few cocktails in one of the times I was there. And I just stopped because I got hit with the wood paneling they used smelled like the wood paneling in that Super America that I hadn't smelled in three, four decades",

Like I'll never forget waking up uh at my mom's house when he passed away. You know what I mean? I I was up visiting my mom. I was at Missou at the time and I was going to drive back that morning and waking up to the news that he had passed and I was like, \"Oh my god.\" And it would have been I'm within a few years there I had seen him speak live after he had been injured.

Obviously the movie again is way quicker to it. Superman. It pulls a whole bunch of documentary footage that I remember from back in the day. Then being here, he talks to his whole family. It's incredible. But I remember his journey being so inspiring. And you know, my mom was an administrative assistant for a long time.

Oh, dude. This thing had a whole bunch of [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] before it ever got to Donner. Donner took it over. They kind of knew each other. And then when Spielberg was producing Goonies, he was supposed to direct Goonies also, but he's like, \"I can't do it for I think it was a scheduling conflict. We brought Donner in to do it and Donner was like, \"Yeah, it was great.\" Yeah, this is one of those rare movies where I feel like the the movie itself and we're going to get to opinions and all that is so interesting and what they did especially for the time period blah blah.

He's like no. He's like I got the Superman rights. He's like all right I'll give you a million dollars to do it. He's like, \"Okay, I'm in or whatever.\" And they sent him this telephone book script that made no it was all it was, \"Do you know any of this? Is this in your notes? Sorry.\" They sent him this script, right? And it's again, it's so easy for us now with the success of the MCU with Superman and a million other things and even the failures, right?

Like they are making it a Superman movie to be like the Adam West Batman TV show cuz that's all people really knew from like modern superheroes of the time. And so it's like all this bizarre [\u00a0__\u00a0] The one that always gets called out, and I know I'm going to lose you on this, but I'll have you. Telly Savales.

And so he's going and he looking at bald people in Metropolis. And so he lands and like grabs a guy by the shoulder and it turns around and it's Telly Savage. I was wondering what that was all about. And he says his touchstone line of back at you baby or whatever the [\u00a0__\u00a0] his line was. Look, here's looking at you, baby. Or whatever. Exactly. And so like Matt Murdoch, it's this great story of Richard Donner gets it and looks at it.

He puts on the Christopher Reeve screen test suit that obviously it wasn't Reeve yet, but it was this.

It's a massive [\u00a0__\u00a0] deal because by by union rules, if someone else had shot the majority of the film, they get director credit.
