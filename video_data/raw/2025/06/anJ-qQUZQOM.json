That was a a fun little weekend delight. Little little surprise, little delight. Surprise and delight. Yeah, I feel like we've already taken it too far, but I don't think there's any end in sight. Oh, no. I think we're about to be using this [\u00a0__\u00a0] like every day this year. I don't know where the the phrase surprise and delight first originated. There's no way they invented it.

Today's Xbox game showcase, of course, is from yesterday. opened with an in-depth trailer featuring The Outer Worlds 2. Obsidian's big sequel is looking quite strong in the new video, which features several new tools and twists we haven't seen yet. We were also treated to a release date. The Outer Worlds 2 releases on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 29th. Over the course of the trailer, we see the colony of Arcadia is undergoing an invasion, and it appears that the story will jump ahead from the beginning of that war to a point nearly 3 years in. voiceover from villainous CEO Auntie Cleo leans hard into the dark satirical elements that the first game established around the nature of capitalism.

After the showcase, The Autoorlds 2 saw an update to its Steam page that confirmed that the game is set to release at a $79.99 price point. Tim, so I have a question that I can't find the answer to. Mhm. I seem to remember Outer Worlds one being a relative budget title. Was it not $40 or $50? I don't remember that. I feel like it was $60, but kind of funny.com/you wrong.

And look, sequels can be that much bigger and require that much more. And like that's has happened before and like it's not necessarily a bad thing. Obviously, this $80 conversation we're having with games right now is frustrating at the least and not fun because it feels like we're going to be stuck in this conversation ad nauseium about every single title that comes out and having to debate why this and not this and all of that. Xbox has said in the last couple months that it's pushing its games up to 80. So, this isn't a surprise. It's just I think unfortunate that this title is the first one that they're that they're doing that with. Yeah.

We'll do a review later in the week, but like definitively it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] That game is $80. Like, I am loving it. I'm enjoying the hell out of it. I'm putting many hours into it. I think I'm 20 hours in at this point, and I'm going to put many more, like double that, I think, in the next couple weeks. Uh but $80 for what we're given doesn't feel right to me. And so looking at uh this, it's like this does look bigger and more substantial than even Outer Worlds one. But $80 just is it's not great no matter what way you shake it.

On one hand, um, video games over the years, over the decades, have be have gotten a lot more technically complex. They've gotten a lot bigger. They've gotten a lot deeper. And the prices have stayed the same through the decades. And so, when you look at a video game today versus what we got in 2008, naturally, I do think prices of video games probably should increase. Now, that is also the part of me that wants that money to go to the labor that's being put into making these video games and the people that are actually doing that.

And even when we are talking about tiny teams, there's the reality of the freelancers and just like kind of third party uh services that need to be hired and paid for and all of that adds up to a lot of money.

And I think that frustration has been pointed a lot to the video games and to the video game companies. I think part of that is warranted and is valid. But I also think it's the fact that people aren't making as much money overall as they should be, right? The economy overall is in a very bad place. And so we're focused in on video games because that is our job. We're here to talk about video games, but overall, I feel like a lot of luxury items are just going through this as far as, oh man, I want to enjoy life.

Movie prices, book prices, like any media at all is going up. Subscription prices for things. And yeah, there are ways to offshoot this like things like Game Pass where yeah, you compare buying $80 for Outer Worlds 2 or you subscribe to Game Pass, you don't own it, but you get access to play Outer Worlds 2 and every other game that Xbox is putting out, which at this point when they own half the [\u00a0__\u00a0] world, it's going to be a lot of games, but that is still something that even that the price is going up and up and up, and there's no end in sight to that.

And how you're seeing a lot of money, a lot of shareholder money being pulled away as things start to level out and video games aren't like ballooning ballooning ballooning as far as how much money is coming in, right?

This Out of Worlds 2 going to $80 in price makes Xbox Game Pass a more valuable proposition. And that is kind of like the double-edged sword of it of like how Xbox has to [\u00a0__\u00a0] balance, and how we have to look at it, right? But like, and it's going to sell great on PS5 at $80. Do you think so? Yeah. I wonder. See, that's the thing that I think about is what does every all these video games going up in price do for the sales of video games? Because I think for me when I think about I'm and we're all here in a very blessed place as far as getting codes and like I don't have to think as much about like buying every single video game, right?
