            "text": "Any opening statements about the state of handheld gaming in 2025? Paris Lily, I think Microsoft with Windows has an opportunity to really dominate that market for everything that you were just talking about. Windows is the dominant operating system. Windows allows you to have anti-che so you can play games like Fortnite and Call of Duty. Windows allows you to have multiple storefronts, whether it be Xbox, Steam, GOG, Epic, Ubisoft on on down the line. Obviously, what we got to see uh last week is them trying to iterate and and have a a true Windows handheld experience that's easy to use. Press the power button, you're into your games, you're able to play them, have the multiple stores. We talked about the emulation piece of this. Obviously, Windows is very friendly with that as well. They're not there yet. I want be crystal clear on that. There is still work that they need to do to get there. I think right now clearly Nintendo with the Switch 2 kind of dominates the handheld market.",

I think right now clearly Nintendo with the Switch 2 kind of dominates the handheld market. We're seeing the sales numbers out there. I say behind them what Valve has done with Steam OS. But Linux, you know, has its limitations, which is why I think Windows does have an opportunity if they can kind of shore up some of those sore points that they have right now. But I'm excited for the future of handheld gaming because I do think there is a market there. I think every everything that you listed out about it, the fact that I can play my AAA PC games on the go when I'm traveling, I can cloud stream them at high quality as I'm sitting on my couch, you know, through through my my internal network. Things like that excite me for the future of where handheld gaming is going. Um, we're almost there, I think, but there's still work to be done. Mike, I actually don't know about you and",

Mike, I actually don't know about you and handheld gaming at all. Like, what are your thoughts on it in general and let alone 2025? Yeah, I'm more the person on the fence about handheld gaming here, probably on this panel. Uh, I feel like I am surviving an onslaught of everybody having a handheld gaming device now or announcing a new one that I should go purchase. I am just overwhelmed on the Tik Tok shop of all these different emulators that are trying to get sold for 70 to 100 plus dollars. And so for me, handheld gaming has kind of come really fast on these past couple of years where before it was clear, this is the Game Boy. I like the Game Boy. This is my Nintendo 3DS. I get that, right? I think the Nintendo Switch really nailed the handheld for me after, of course, the PSP and VA, which I loved and enjoyed. But the Switch",

But the Switch nailed what a handheld to me in this new generation should be, right? It is a atome console and then it can be picked up and on the- go for that versatility and that portability. And so for me now, I look at my Switch, it's like, okay, well, they nailed that. Like that is where I go to. But I am someone who plays in a lot of different ecosystems and I kind of want my games to come with me and I've always had a dream of X Y and Z, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, Steam all coming with me somewhere, right? And so now I'm a little overwhelmed by how much options there are and the worry that if I invest X amount of dollars into something, I'm going to be left behind or I'm going to miss out on something or it's going to become e-waste.

My favorite word, Tim Gettys, in 3 to 5 years where no, that's not viable anymore. We've moved past that, right? As an Xbox fan, we've come hard off of the Xbox Series S. And I know for me and Paris will tell you, not many games were really held back by that. But there was way too many news stories of the Xbox Series S is holding it all back. They can't make games for this. Oh, this game's not releasing there. And so I worry about handhelds being the same way of like if I invest this now this game won't run on it or this game runs so poorly on it it's not worth it. And so I'm a little more on the fence about that. I think portability as well is a fun conversation we'll have here uh throughout.

Uh, you know, I think we're very lucky and me in particular since I'm a little bit older than most people and not older than Paris. Come on, no one's that old. Uh, but the idea that, you know, I've talked at length about the fact that all the nerds like me grew up and kind of took over the world in some very bad ways, but in some great ways, right, in the way of like all these superhero movies we get and all this cool [\u00a0__\u00a0] and how popular video games are and da da da.

But especially when I came to IGN in 2007 and you'd sit there and review all these different versions of games and really find usually and I'm talking about like you know crossplatform tie when they're trying to do like a tie-in or a thing or a wrestling game or a sports game find the handheld version to be so less than you know what I mean not be able to I'm not talking about exclusives or something like Elite Beat agents or Lumines or whatever right but like you're getting into these games that were designed for the",

Handheld gaming as we knew it in 2007 could never exist like it does now. And rather than it go away, it really opened up to, hey, gamers want to be able to play their games everywhere. You know, I I joke around obviously all the time about the VA and the PSP and you know, they I just Blue I BSed Blue Sky uh Tim uh that you know, VA crawled so that all of these handhelds could run.

I mean, we are living in such a great time in terms of portable gaming devices, handheld gaming devices on the PC and console side. Like, I feel like because of how handheld devices are, they're they're kind of a area in tech that cares about the tech of it, I think, more than most because it has to have the hardware to be able to run the games, but also a screen to be able to display them, but also a controller to be able to to have the inputs, right? So the combination and ingenuity required for these devices I think requires them to really like push things forward and come up with like new standards that everyone can then learn from each other.

And it reminds me a lot of thinking about just controllers and like all right there wasn't a D-pad until there was. There wasn't an analog stick until there was. And then there becomes these kind of like standards that are set of we need shoulder buttons. We need this many face buttons. And you know if a controller came out for a new system and it had 20 face buttons, guess what? They're not going to be used because games need to be made for every single device. So they have to be homogenized to a certain level. So, I think we're at a great sparities. And I think we're in a great place that no matter what your needs are, you'll at least get a good enough version if you're willing to spend the money.

And uh, I really do think that we're at the point with handheld gaming that we were with the I'll say iPhone 10 when it for finally went full screen, right? And it's just like ever since then, it's like cool, the phone tech's being upgraded, but at the end of the day, the iPhone X is all you need, you know? And sure, an iPhone X in 2025 is maybe unacceptable, but like in terms of what it needs to do, it has all those functions.

Uh, my point being, I feel like we're already at that point. the we're at the the convergence points the smartphones hit a decade ago now because we're freaking crazy old. Um, but I think handh held devices on the small side are perfection and on the higherend side I think with the help of cloud streaming are essentially at perfection. But without that we're just a couple years away from being in in a perfection place. Having said that, the moment we get there, the hardware for consoles and PC is going to be higher anyway.

Um, I I just prefer through the hardware and obviously the user interface that Steam OS has. And I have enough of the games I like to play on my Steam library that it makes it pretty accessible for me. After that would be the Switch. I mean, clearly from the Nintendo games that I would be able to play on that. I do have um, and I never get these names right, but I have the the Rogue Ally, the original one.

Do you have any uh Steam Deck and the Switch? Of course, I go to where my collection of game catalog is, where I've spent the most money, where I want to be able to play those games anywhere.

Um, but the other ones I want to give a shout out to for sure because of course the Nintendo Switch 2, that's the best single device if you just want to keep things easy and you're a Nintendo fan. It's a no-brainer. Um, you know, things are going to work and the things that are going to work are your Nintendo games, both modern and go back to NSO. Great ways to play at this point a very sizable library of the vast majority of Nintendo's history you'd ever want to actually play.

But on the handheld side, like the old school emulator side that I care a lot about. To me, the creme to la creme, it's the Retroid Pocket 5. This thing shaped like a Vita, but bigger buttons. Uh, beautiful OLED screen, like one of the nicest screens I've ever seen. Um, and this thing can go all the way up to like PS2 and all that easy. PS3 and that sometimes hit or miss or whatever, but if you dial things in, you can get it going. But in addition to all that, it streams great. Like this could be a PlayStation Portal replacement.

Uh the PlayStation Portal it does just work uh once you set it up. I mean, and it's very specific in your house, it just works. You can take it farther if you want to, but on the the other side, the more time you spend tinkering and dialing in on all the specific like internet data stuff, it's a much better experience, but you have to do that stuff.
