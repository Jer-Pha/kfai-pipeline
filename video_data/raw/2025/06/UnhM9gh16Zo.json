I'm joined by Blessing Adoya Jr. Good day, Tim. Greg Miller. Hello, Tim. And Andy Cortez. Y'all got to give up on High Five, man. It's just not happening, dude. This is not happening. We just watched Jeff Keyy's Summer GameFest 2025. Uh co-hosted by Lucy James. Very, very cool to see. She crushed it. We love you, Lucy. Um but we are now going to review what we just saw, break it all down, and let you know our highs and lows, games we're excited for, new game announcements that we are now maybe putting on our fantasy critic. Why would you say those words? Why would you say those words? We were all thinking it. Yeah, but like maybe not everybody. Maybe not everybody. Maybe not everybody was thinking it. So [\u00a0__\u00a0] man. But now I'm so [\u00a0__\u00a0] out, Andy, that it's like whatever. Like I just there's no Now I can only play to [\u00a0__\u00a0] someone else over. Ah, but you",

No, I was going to say usually it feels like it's always me. Andy Cortez, what did you think of this showcase? I will break the cycle. I thought that this showcase was cool because I got to spend time watching my friends. Oh, yeah. Watch video games with my friends and I I totally agree with every initial point that Jeff makes in that intro speech of it's important to have eyes on the things.

Um, who [\u00a0__\u00a0] media, coach media. That being said, that being said, this is still a summer gamefest showcase and I would say that I was a bit more disappointed. I I still think that, you know, with how he has been tweeting the past couple days, I didn't expect anything to kind of blow me away. There were still some awesome surprises, but I'm not the Resident Evil 9 guy or the Resident Evil fan. So, like that that doesn't do a whole lot for me, but I recognize what that does for the video game community, and that's awesome. Liza P Shadow Drop, awesome as hell.

I think, you know, we know what Summer Gamefest is going to be, right? As a presentation, it's going to be two hours and Jeff has to fill those two hours uh however he can. I think he did an interesting job of setting the stage, you know what I mean? To come out and be like, \"Hey, here's the bestselling games on Steam. So many of them are small teams, da da da.\" It wasn't until we were deep. I was like, \"Oh, you did that and now you're calling out this is a 38 person team. This is a because that's what this year is.\" I think we could have gone harder. You know, I always talk about writing a review, right, is just persuasive writing.",

You know, I always talk about writing a review, right, is just persuasive writing. Writing a script for a show like this is as well. I think we could have had a thesis statement a little earlier of like, hey, this year it is all about the smaller teams and the smaller announcements and this that and the other. Not doing that, but still being Jeff Keelley and still being Summer GameFest and still being Hideokima and Mads M like you we expect a certain level of a few pops throughout this and I felt like this was a year where Summer GameFest as a presentation really didn't have those pops. On top of that, and I'm, you know, I'd like to imagine you all know how much I love independent video game developers, smaller game devs. It's not that the problem I had here was I felt so many games look alike. This is for me personally going to be one of those years of the trailer pops up or",

I felt like I made a joke early on about oh man Bloodborne ruined action RP and here and that was a joke for the record but it was like oh man there are so many other games that I feel fall into that it's this horror thing that isn't this thing and da da da and so you get into a lose-lose situation for Jeff of you can't take a summer gamefest off you should highlight smaller games and smaller team teams and if this is what's coming to you it's what's coming to you in a and we are talking about a very competitive uh landscape for showcases where you have things like 61 Indie doing theirs, right?

Like clearly there are big players out there, smaller players out there that are doing things. But I think what you're seeing when you look at a wholesome games or a 61 indie, they get to massage their message better and really have a vision for this is what you're getting. And so for here, for the vision, I don't think to be as strong at the front of we're doing independ we're doing small teams. We're nail here. I want to introduce you to the next Cliffs of Scar. throw industry in the next not having that and just kind of this felt like one that didn't have a a a through line to it.

Again, it I mean it's just what I think of watching it or whatever. I think there's sh there's shining stuff in here of like oh I'm excited for that game. But I think the majority of the games for me are going to be the oh what was that one again or what okay oh the g which Game of Thrones is that oh the RTS if they didn't end with Resident Evil 9 it would have been I think a disaster. Yeah. Like to to have that little tease and even to see how bummed out Tim and Blessing were in that moment of like why would you just say we'll have something new coming up to announce?

Yeah, I can agree more with what Greg just said, right? I think Oh, yeah. Pleasure. Yeah. Um, I think my thing with it, and I'm a five out of 10 as well, is to Greg's point, when I think of my time with the showcase, right? It's hard for me to be salty with a showcase like this because And I don't think any of us are, right? But like I think to kind of balance out where I'm at, where I'm about to be, right? And for me, it is the thing of I look at games like Felt That Boss Boxing. I look at games like Lego Voyagers. I look at Liza P Overture. There's a large I look at Acts of Blood. There's a large amount of games here where I'm like, man, I'm so [\u00a0__\u00a0]",

Man, I'm coming out of this showcase being with a handful of games that I cannot [\u00a0__\u00a0] wait for. And I think with that, I'm high on it as far as like, oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm really excited about the future of this. I think to balance that out though, I the big problem here is the construction of the show. And funny enough, um, 61 Indie came to mind for me as well, which is a show that most of the people watching this have not seen. It's a indie showcase, and I watched it a few weeks ago when it went up. And that show had way better construction. And to your point, Greg, like they teed the games up very well of, oh, now let's take a look at these comedy games. Now, let's take a look at, you know, this category of games, right? And they were",

Now, let's take a look at, you know, this category of games, right? And they were able to make those montages make sense and make those trailer showcases very exciting and interesting. I look back at the Annaperna showcases that we've gotten before that do such a great job of teeing up devs and creating stories, creating through lines that keep us engaged and interested. Uh the big problem here and why I would give this showcase a five out of 10 is when I think about the goal of Summer GameFest and what you're here to do. You're here to put people on, right? You're here to put people on to games that they might not have heard of. You're of course here to showcase like the big new exciting games or whatever, right? But when we're talking about years that might be down years, guess what? You want people to be hyped as [\u00a0__\u00a0] for Acts of Blood and all the games, Lego",

You want people to be hyped as [\u00a0__\u00a0] for Acts of Blood and all the games, Lego Voyagers and Felt That Boxing, these games that I'm naming. And when you have that coupled with so much just so much bloat, so much downtime, so much of the of a showcase where I'm kind of like bored, wanting to pick up my phone, not really caring about what's on screen. To Greg's point, having a bunch of Souls games that for a lot of people do mold together, even for me, and I'm sure for Andy too, right? Like I see Code Vein. I see I mean Lfield Overture is hyped as [\u00a0__\u00a0] right? I see quite a few of these Souls things and I'm like, yeah, like when you have these spread out through the show like this, they kind of meld together in a certain way. That's not doing the games that stand out of service because then it's like I'm I'm just not excited throughout the whole thing, right? Like you",

Like you want to do these games of service and I wonder does this need to be two hours? Could this have been a hour long show? We get into the argument of paying the bills and the commercials and all that stuff, but you got to balance it because you got to maintain the show as something that has prestige and something that people want to pay attention to and want to tune in for and are excited for. And so, um, I came out of this with a lot of games I'm excited for, but I think this year needed some work as far as the pacing and construction. I think something goes with the prestige as well, like you, we've seen with Keeley and with the names that he's been able to get in the past, and you also can't force big developers to say, \"Show me your big game.\" and or show me something. Even though you're not",

Even though you're not ready, I don't care. So, I totally get that part of it. But when I like the collection of games we saw here is as stoked as I'd be if I watched the future game showcase, which was like a couple weeks ago, and I saw about seven to 10 games. I'm like, \"Oh, those all look really cool. Let me write those down.\" I this kind of felt like that level which is, you know, that sounds like I'm kind of, you know, talking [\u00a0__\u00a0] about it, but I I think you can still have those selection of games along with the larger big titles. And if you don't, it's going to feel like another one of these showcases that is the future game showcase or a wish list. A wish list showcase. Yeah. Hey, here are some cool stuff to see and add to your list and do it. I think it's the idea that, and I tell me if I'm out of",

When we think about SGF, we're thinking about maybe they have Halfife 3, maybe of this. When we think about Jeff, we think maybe they have Halfife 3, maybe they have something for Naughty Dog. I've never been more proud of you guys talking about the storytelling of these showcases. You know what I mean? Like, yes, we need to care about that stuff. And this show needed to care a little bit more about that stuff. This was uh a hard watch, I would say. And I think there's a lot of reasons for that. I I'm in line with all of you. Uh I'm between the five and the six and I think I'm actually going to settle on the 5.5 cuz we do that here. And the reason for that,",

I'm looking at a lot of these smaller titles and how many of them I'm like I'm legitimately interested. Not just that looks cool, but the Felt That Boxing, Out of Words, Acts of Blood, the Scott Pilgrim EX, like there's a fair amount of games here. Into the Unwell, be blighted. Uh, blighted. Yeah. Like there's so many of those games. They're not just like the oh, that looks kind of neat. It's like the these could be the next big indie games that we're talking about. So, I don't want to overlook that fact where it's like I do think that they delivered on the let's show up for the small teams and showcase these games.

They have to happen and I totally understand that. I think they can be and should be presented better. Um and on top of that it's the cool the AAA games are here but when they're showcases every single day legitimately like James Bond is probably going to come up multiple more times this weekend. That kind of sucks. You know, we even back in the day, we would not like when Call of Duty showed up multiple times throughout the weekend. And I feel like the big James Bond game stuff feels like a paid ad when you have a guy come up on stage that we're just like, get this guy off the stage. Like, that's not fun.

Maybe don't take that long though if you don't really have anything to say. for Death Stranding, which I think in a showcase celebrating games and all that, but no music performance, you know, no like even kind of like fun thing like that to kind of celebrate in a different way that I think could have really broke up the pacing in a necessary way. And I'm not talking about paid advertisement music or like what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] why you doing this, but Expedition 33 music that would have got a lot of people hyped in a way and would have pissed other people off.

I think the shift of power of expecting Resident Evil to be a PlayStation but now Resident Evil 9 the next core Resident Evil game announced it a key summer show. I think that's a good sign for the key summer shows but um I hated how they announced it. Like I legitimately like that to say I'm offended is way too extreme. But like that sucked. That was not fun. That was not cute. That was just like I was already not into the show and it made me kind of hate the show. And like that's it's not like a fun you got me type thing.

When I when we look at games like and I don't want to compare Anusha to Mecca Break and and um Splitgate 2, right? But there are the brand of games where it's once they start showing up too much, they then turn into the noise of a Call of Duty presentation that makes me go, \"All right, cool. This is now this is now just noise to me.\" Even though there is hype for Anamusha. Mhm. Yeah.

Uh, that's a wrap on Greg Miller. Wrap on Greg Miller. Everybody, I I encourage I know your Princess Dye is leaving, but I encourage you to keep watching this. All right. You just never know what he's going to say. He's Prince Charles. You're Camila. You're one of the boys. Okay. Have fun, Greg. Tell people I say hi. Bye, Greg. Um, yeah. Then we got to the Resident Evil uh village on sale section where they got um the actress of Lady. Yes. she came out and said that the Resident Evil games are on sale, which is like cool, whatever.

Um but Mads Mickelson is the target in a limited time event in Hitman. Um, Lazla Lashifra, which is awesome. One of my favorite of the the James Bond villains. So, Casino Royale and having Mads come back. That's awesome. Very cool stuff. Um, but it also I don't know, something about this just sits with me a little weird. Oh, why? Just the way they announced it all and stuff. That's it. Yeah, it wasn't as exciting as it could have been. I think the big thing is that there's just not hype for Mind's Eye.

But obviously this is a very far cry from Keo Reeves coming out during Cyberpunk, right? Like this felt kind of I think forced is probably the word for it.

I think it really just makes everything feel like how Hitman has just continuously been coming out. James Bond should feel different. It shouldn't feel like we're just continuing that trend even though everyone loves Hitman. Yeah. you know, it's like it feels like they're still navigating being a publisher and being a multi-game dev now and what that means and how they how they connect their things together because yeah, like it muddies the message and like I would lump in Mind's eye to that conversation of absolutely oh yeah, like Minds Eye really muddies",
