Of course. Of course. I There's been a lot of chatter from y'all chatterheads about, \"Hey, where is he? What's going on?\" Then we saw the redesign on the site. All right. They want to be redesigning to put him on the site. Going to be in this [\u00a0__\u00a0] game. All right. Then, do you get Cranky? Yes, you you definitely get Cranky.

There's always still time. There's a lot of time, but I did think that that would have been like a you have a month away from this. Like do a couple cool things on your Nintendo Switch, too. Listen, the world doesn't look as favorably upon Donkey Kong 64. So I I think the Nintendo state of mind is let's not ruin people's appetite before we get to Bonanza. All right, that that's fair.

But as somebody that really cares about like the challenge and all that other stuff, collectibles, um I was a little concerned watching this.

I think one of the big things with a platformer from this team is the game feel. And with Mario, it is all about the movement. It's all about throwing Cappy, diving off of Caffy, Cappy, like bouncing up and like how good it it feels to control the character. In this game, it you don't have that. Like it is I think there's a different focus as far as the way they want you to play this game. Like as I'm watching the the the gameplay right now, right, it is very much more tinkery as far as like what you're doing with the environment, what you're doing as far as like destruction, what you're doing as far as like the the the collectathon aspects and like kind of like digging into the world, like literally digging into the world.

But my question for that, because I watched this and as somebody who loved Mario Odyssey and really pushed hard that year for it to be game of the year, as much as I love Breath of the Wild, I look at this and see so much Odyssey in it, but also don't get turned off by the idea that it's not going to be as precise. Even when we you're talking about the dodge jump or whatever you were air dash when it popped up, like I feel like he's going to h have a movement.

Like we had that, right? And like we're digging through and all this stuff. Yeah. I mean, we see a lot of this in the the presentation we saw, but even in what we played.

So, it it kind of reminds me of Breath of the Wild in the sense of like you start the game off and you have all your abilities already and it's like you have your tools. It's just a matter of using them. This game, I mean, we didn't get all of the things they showed, but it did feel like, oh yeah, we could pull the thing out of the ground, surf on it, throw it at something else, stick it on something like there was a lot of stuff at our disposal immediately.

Obviously the Nintendo's giving Donkey Kong a huge push with his movie appearances and the theme park and all that stuff, but like the redesign and everything like let's give another franchise of Nintendo a chance to like be that top tier one of the big five. Yeah, he sounds like a WWE getting the push right now. real talk like getting getting that push and Pauline as well like I think is cool seeing her start to appear in the sports games and cart and now getting this new iteration and like kind of like fleshing it out and also it being a little girl I think is kind of cool like for this to be a kind of boy feeling game of like this big monkey breaking [\u00a0__\u00a0] but it's like oh like it's about a girl that's a singer yeah it's getting a lot of like uh Frozen vibes as well I just feel like this is like a",
