But before I do, we got to bring up a big crime that's been committed this last generation of video games.\n Make fun of Barrett.\n And that's Nintendo Switch and Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, Greg. Being trapped on that system. That's [\u00a0__\u00a0] up that we can't play that everywhere. I\n agree. I better play that again.\n That game rocks. But that this game will scratch my itch, though. So, good enough. Okay, I'll take it.\n What about Andy? Let's talk about Elen Ring Night Rain. Of course, it is an from software experience made exclusively for me, the only jabron who loves multiplayer games mixed with battle royale, closing circles, and uh sprinkle in a little from software magic. This is a game that I love to death. It will probably go down as one of my top favorites in the uh the company's franchise list here.\n Yeah. I mean, you're you were saying this is probably going to be your number one of the year.",

Uh being able to share it with my friends. Most importantly, having it being very fast and not have it, hey, let's slow down. Let's read these stats. Let me guess. If I put 50 into health, how much more will my health bar go up? It's just simply, hey, drop your runes off here at this sight of grace. Let's level up. Let's move on to the next awesome piece of action. And so it's this blend of highpaced action, extreme difficulty with from software game design, and then on top of that, of course, my favorite is the map exploration. I am always wowed and impressed by all the cool scenes that we see, all the different bosses that they mix in to the different locations and having what, Andy, 10 bosses. How many do they have? Eight to 10.\n Uh they have eight unique bosses.",

It was a weird review period because this I think this game is very much a your mileage may vary. Whenever anybody asks, should I play this? I have no friends to play with. I would say no, probably because it's the same thing as signing on to play signing on alone to play squads in Fortnite. When two teammates immediat immediately run opposite directions, you're like, \"Oh, [\u00a0__\u00a0] This is why am I even here right now?\" And that can happen quite a bit in the Elder Ring Night Reign experience based on just reading a whole lot of tweets. I know the first couple days in there they were having a lot of matchmaking issues and it took a while for the game to kind of get its rating up above mostly negative or mixed on on Steam because a lot of people were having issues with networking and just with what the game was and then they",

So whenever you do go down, you can just kind of come back during a boss fight. And uh I I mean I I my opinion of this game has only gone up. I think the game really really surprised me with how much deeper it was. I thought it was it really just felt like wow this is a like one of the best mods you could download on the internet and you know they it's cool what they've done here they just want to this was just one of the teams on from software saying I really want to make a kind of rogike fast-paced multiplayer experience and you know we look at this as hopefully their testing grounds for their future in multiplayer and making things easier to squat up with friends but I would say that my op yeah yeah my opinion this only went up cuz I think when the game came out I was like yeah I think it's around an eight out of 10.

I' I'd go up to like a nine. I I think that um the explorable areas with how the world does change with these shifting lands and how much adventure we found where once you beat a boss then the next time you drop into the world there will be a massive part of the map that is different and changed and exploring that was so much fun. um trying to find the balance of we're running out of time, but I really really want to explore this. Having those sort of mini metagame excursions where you go, I mean, Mike, it felt like every round we were going, \"Oh, we got to go take on that rooftop boss cuz it was so challenging. I think we could take it on now.\" You got Loretta, the run killer. Like, there's just so many awesome moments in this game that are fun as hell.

Like I I know some people can look at RNG as something that can just kind of get in the way, but whenever random number generator, that's what it means. So I hate saying RNG and some people just don't even know what that means. Um but the the RNG of sometimes having a run and then suddenly the build is working out and you go, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] this is going to be a special one.\" It it just gets really exciting. And then us beating the bosses and having people from Chad join us. It was a good time. I had a I had a lot of fun with it. Yeah. Mike, what are you prepared to give it a kind of funny score?",

This is, like I said, a game that is strictly for me. And I think there are others that probably found a lot of fun with their friends doing this, but as someone who's always wanted to share the Dark Souls experience with others and then having that turned up to 10 where there is a giant map, there is a closing circle and it is, hey, we can't stand around at the sight of grace and discuss what move sets we should get. we just need to go go and have that all mixed in so well where yeah there is a little bit of thought process right Andy of like what are my passives on all these weapons that I grab what is that next thing that I should be looking for whether it be a buff uh to maybe help some of my moves or is it something that will affect the boss in a different way different like poisons holy damage what should we be kind of gearing",

But I love the just fast-paced nature of this. I think the bosses are really tuned well for a threeplayer situation. Each boss felt like they were coming after every single person on the screen no matter what. There wasn't much free time. The only time I ever felt like I was uh free to just kind of be quiet and easy was when I had a weapon that said, \"Hey, the boss will rarely look at you.\" Right? And so I think they did a great job tuning these these eight bosses to, hey, three players are on the screen and they really know how to attack you. I think in other soft games, they're not",

I think in other soft games, they're not really tuned to have two or three other people on the screen with you. It is usually a one v one fight. And so to see them say, \"Hey, this is the core of the game. Let's build these bosses out like that.\" Every single one was so much fun to see from, of course, the beginning when the wolf turns into three wolves and all of you are getting attacked one by one. I think that's really cool to the final boss where he can just, you know, close the gap and create space so quickly on you that you're never really safe no matter how far away you are. I think each of the character classes are really built out in a fun way for you to try and be something different than you normally would be. I'm usually a sorcerer and even the sorcerer in this class is different than how I would play, right? Because",

And so each one from the super tank berserker guy to of course the guardian eagle who is kind of the the big shield man uh all have their own unique stuff. And I think that's what will get me coming back. Tim is there's things that I want now in the future now that I've beaten it that I want to see.
