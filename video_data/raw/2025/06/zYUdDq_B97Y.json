Why would they adapt that as a Superman movie into a live action thing? I don't know, but they did. And Richard Prior's there.

Now it's time for Ragu Bagu. Ragu Bagu\n What's up everybody? Welcome to podcast within a podcast Rad guys talk bad guys where we of course rank all the bad guys of the Superman in review series. Currently the list looks like this. Number one is Zod Ursa Nan and Lex from Superman 2. Number two is Lex Luthor Otis and Miss Tesm from Superman. Where do we want to put Vera Laura Ross Webster? I Superman doesn't agree with me but I'm putting Richard Prior in there. Warman bad Superman Superman in there, too.\n Here's my thing. I I don't like him.

Not not by leagues, not by like, oh man, but I mean I mean their plans and whatever, but I mean like I Luther Otis and Tesmacher from one I like their interplay together more than what I got here. I think again Richard Prior being like Gus Gorman as a character makes me angry with the film\n of like you he is a bad Superman take him to jail too. Like you know what I mean? Okay, here's my\n Why are we turning over a new leaf for this guy who also isn't taking You just got him a job, an honest job with honest people at a coal factory.\n Yeah, he's not going to stay.

My counter argument for that is at least the the Webster character, which is just a knockoff of of Lex Luthther. They're all competent, capable people whose planes actually kind of work and they make a supercomput that almost kills Superman. And also,\n I would take Gene Hackman over all of them any day.\n I would take Ned Batty over all. Yeah, me too. I love\n comedic bits and all that. All right, so there you go then. We're putting him at third. Gus, Vera, Laura, Ross, Bad Superman go in at three on Superman 3. And even though we've been rough on this film, Tim, we do need to do Secret Delights.
