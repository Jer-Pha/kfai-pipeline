Oh, it's not this blah blah blah. like you're I understand that and I understand when we're looking at the UI and holding it and like the this all feels very reminiscent of the Switch one, but the speed at which it moves, which you could just say the Switch should have always moved at, but whatever.

I will say the game card stuff is already kind of confusing with like Switch one and Switch 2 versions cuz I didn't realize I bought the Switch one version of Delta Rune last night. But it was nice that uh you get the Switch 2 version for free if you bought Delta Rune Switch One version. So I was able to just download that.

Like hopping into the GameCube stuff, you know, popping open Soulcalibur, too, and being like, damn, this is here. Like, this is really nice to have.

I think our job dictates what we play in a lot of ways because you're reviewing stuff. since Nintendo does no bit. I'm not doing a bit only give us one review code.

I'm actually on the complete other end of you about that conversation. I think that on initial first blush when Bless and I played in New York, I was like, \"Oh, this feels just like Mario Kart 8 and I'm so happy about that.\" Playing it a lot more now. I'm like, \"Oh, there's a lot of differences.\" And I think it's on the more high-end level. I think that the charge jump stuff and the rails and the the amount of paths because of how open world the maps are. I feel like right now we're at a level where it is we're playing with the basic people that are we all don't know what we're doing and so it's frantic chaos. The moment that people can split up and be on the different level paths because of the advanced tech. I think that's where or tech moves. I think that's where uh this is going to get a lot more competitive and a",

And I I think it's going to be more like and that's that's where I've been interested playing the free roam stuff is for as kind of not forts of horizon as it is. It does function as a good tutorial to teach you that stuff that us just playing Mario Kart the way we've always played Mario Kart isn't going to do you know so we're all like how do you jump? How do you whatever. Playing the free roam stuff you kind of are forced to using the P blocks. I was going to say that stuff. Well, I I haven't had a chance to play Mario Kart by myself. Watching Bless do the challenge, right?

So, we were talking about with the different paths and stuff like you know, I think one of the things that always entertained me when I would watch videos of people playing Mario Kart 8, we're seeing the shortcuts and I'm like, \"Oh, I would have never thought about that.\" I think this game giving you a mode where you can literally just drive around and just discover probably is on purpose so that like yeah for the ways that these tracks are are um designed like they want you to to know the exact route you're going to take or the exact rail you're going to take and how you're going to get on get onto it. Yeah, I think this game's going to be less about the shortcuts and more about the Sonic the Hedgehog style of level",

Yeah, I think this game's going to be less about the shortcuts and more about the Sonic the Hedgehog style of level design where there's like high, medium, low. Um, and just depending on how high how fast you can keep your momentum and like find the right path. It's it's more about knowing paths as opposed to and be able to maintain the path as opposed to like finding shortcuts to like cut the seconds off. That'll be there too though. Saying all of that, I don't know that that's necessarily a great thing. I do love that it's different because we've had 10 years of Mario Kart 8 and Deluxe and we just did our review. I gave it a 10. I think that that game over time has only gotten better and more perfect of the type of Mario Kart that it is.

So much to do in Knockout Tour, which is fantastic. Um, but I feel like the open world nature of the entire game is so cool. And I think that the open world is very well designed and so interesting.

Yes. Yeah. Here it's it's kind of what I was talking about not liking about the uh Mario Kart Tour levels being translated over to uh Mario Kart 8 where some of the signage could get a little confusing and because you're not doing the traditional laplap lap and it's variations on the laps because this whole game is that it almost just feels harder to define bits and like have them in your mind of like okay I know this I know this and cool it's a different game like maybe that's the point of it.

Oh, this is sick as hell. This is reminds you of just being in that world. But now it's kind of more environmentally themed along with some of those throwbacks. No, cuz I think we'll get that eventually. And I feel like I loved Mario Kart 8 before it had DLC, so it didn't have any crossovers. It was just Mario. But I think the difference also is Mario Kart 8 had such a defined theme and look and how sleek it was and the uh ways that the tracks would all be like inverted and all this insanity.

More dynamic, but still part of the same hole. You know, it didn't feel like wacky and out there, but like it felt like it made sense, but it was its own thing as at the same time. But yeah, with this one so far, I I do think that the leaning into the Mario stuff I don't think is the problem. It's more this is a very Mario Kart as a franchise game, and I think that has some pros and cons.
