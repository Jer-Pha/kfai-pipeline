Shout out to Sad Boy Bear, my main man running the ones and twos. Today we are back for your kind of funny games afternoon stream for June 17, 2025. It's actually a double stream today, Andy Cortez. It's a double stream. Double stream because we kick off today's part of the stream, part one, with a fun Nvidia sponsored FBC Fire Break gameplay stream showcasing all the latest and greatest tech with Nvidia. And then after that, we'll jump back to Naughty Dog Week with Barrett and Blessing out of the OA here for a very fun tag team stream. So, you're streaming all day long here exclusively on Twitch and on YouTube. So, keep eyes on that. Keep having some fun. Like I said, bear in the Naughty Dog stream alongside Blessing after this.

Uh, but importantly, you also want to have DLSS on. Uh, and right now I love the way Remedy does it because they show you the actual math because your mon my monitor is a 1440p monitor and with DLSS when I drop it to balanced it runs at 835p. Okay.

We are showing off ray tracing with DLSS4, full ray tracing uh through the power of Nvidia. DLSS4 lets you run the craziest visual quality at the best frame rate, at the best resolutions without making you sacrifice either one of those three in the visual triangle.

It runs incredibly smooth. Uh, and you're seeing it on display here with us running everything on ultra uh, and getting like over 150 frames the whole time. It's crazy.
