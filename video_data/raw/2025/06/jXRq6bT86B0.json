Oh my god.\n [\u00a0__\u00a0] that guy.\n You're going to say he died.\n No, even worse.\n You know what? Fair.\n Even worse, I caught him cuz he was selling my Zapdos on the schoolyard.\n Oh, that happens to all of us.\n And I'm like, I knew that was my Zapdos.\n That happened to everybody pretending it wasn't. I knew it was mine. I knew where the crease was. I'm still I'm still best friends with my friend Carlos even though it you know when we were trading Pokemon cards in the dark while they were showing a movie. I think they're showing Twister on TV but we were all but we were all they're making you watch Twister.",

Like, I'm just in love with it. I'm going to keep playing it as the year goes. Um, but I think reviewwise, this is one of those interesting ones of having to balance how much fun, how much enjoyment I'm having out of a thing versus like the launch quality and like potential I see in a thing and what it can do better and what I think it will do better over time. So, I'm going to land at an eight. For a while there, I was going to give it a 7.5, but I had a session last night where I'm just like, dude, I am having way too much fun with this game to be able to give it anything less than an eight. Um, starting with the good of it, it's giving you what you want out of Slow Clap. It has a really, really good art style.

Like it hits like a really really good place as far as being so visually appealing. And I just love looking at this game. I love looking at the characters. I love the character creator even though it's like it's not that advanced. It's kind of bare bones, but like just the art style of it. I just love looking at the characters. It is such a visually appealing game. Um, but then when we talk about the gameplay of it, I described this game a while ago as um, you know, like Rocket League, we we we we call um, soccer with cars.

And I I mean that in the best way possible of I think they hit the perfect middle ground between what you want out of a soccer game, but then what you want out of an arcade game and especially a game that is 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5, because those are the only modes that are available uh, in the game. It does the same beautiful thing that Rocket League does, which is it takes soccer and gives you, I would say, a more genuine soccer experience than you would even get from a FIFA, right? Like a FIFA in terms of gameplay, I would almost look at as like almost kind of like an RTS where you are zoomed out. You are, you know, passing, passing, passing, trying to line up your plays and do and do all",

Like you are picking a direction and just like passing in that direction and praying that it gets to the person that you're passing to. That is how soccer works. Like when I'm on the field and I'm playing with Mike or I'm playing with the folks on our soccer team, I am like I might not see where somebody's making a run, but sometimes I'm like I pray somebody's making a run right now cuz I'm I'm passing this either way. I'm passing this either way. And like this game rematch captures that feeling so well of having to pay attent attention to your position,",

And like this game rematch captures that feeling so well of having to pay attent attention to your position, your teammates's position. Um, and like the freedom that is involved with playing the actual sport. This game captures that uh so well. And I think the tools that they give you as far as like, you know, the square for that directional pass, the R2 to do your hard kick and then like, you know, R1 is the modifier and all these things, right? Like it really brings the the necessary bare bones mechanics you need to make this game really fun. There's no fat in this game. In fact, that's almost to a detriment where there's no like uh stats. There's no, oh, if I make a bigger character, they'll be more heavy. There's no RPG elements. Like, there's none of that.",

And it is way more just about your chemistry with your team and how you guys enter each match. Like, that's the thing that matters the most, right? And I love this game for that. I'm going to continue to love this game for that. I think as far as where the game I think falters, it comes down to the I think a lot of network stuff, you know, when we played the beta months ago, we noticed that there was a lot of lagging, a lot of like weird rubber banding, a lot of like the ball, you would think that you made a pass that was successful and then like the game would skip and then you would see the ball on the other side of the field and it's like, \"Oh, how the [\u00a0__\u00a0] did that happen?\"\n One out of every four matches you were in Asia servers or European servers.",

I'm like, oh, something skipped here. That stuff still uh uh is here and like I think it'll get fixed over time. I hope it gets fixed over time, but that stuff still happens enough. And then also, I think this game has or could have such a bright future ahead of it. I'm going to predict that it does because there's three million players on this thing and has a mill over a million sales. So, I think it's going to be supported.",

There's all that stuff. there's the Tik Tok virality of the game where I've been seeing clips of this game non-stop on my on my algorithms. Um, but it's hard not to compare this game to Rocket League. And I think one of the things that Rocket League did from the get-go was the content. Um, you had like single player stuff that you can do in Rocket League. Granted, it's not like there's a story or anything, but like you could play with bots in Rocket League and do like a mini season and stuff like that. So, if you didn't have people to play with, you could at least like have something to do. This game doesn't have that. This game really is 3v3, 4v4, 5v5, and then you have the 5v5 ranked mode. Um, and even with that, right, like I wish it was 3v3 ranked. That's the way I prefer to play, right?",

Cuz I know\n when the beta when the multiple betas were out, we kind of experimented with all of the three, four or five modes, but I feel like we always kind of fell back on 4v4.

We know all these things, right? I wish they had a rank mode for that. They don't have a rank mode for that at the moment. They also don't have crossplay, but that's that's another conversation. Um 5v5, you have a bigger stage and it feels I think 5v5 feels the most like you're playing wreck league soccer where you're relying so much on your other team or on your other teammates to be where they need to be and deliver and pass and do all that stuff.

And that's kind of like I think the coolest thing about Rematch and a game that I would be playing if we weren't in Arachus, you know, [\u00a0__\u00a0] trying to fight the Shy Halude. I think Rematch is a game that I would be playing if it weren't for Dune Awakening or Liza P. Um because I had a lot of fun with it. But the thing that I love the most about it is the amount of spontaneity, the amount of of because you are one person and the game is so physics- based and it is not automated really in any way. it like it is so hard in this game",

There's none of that. It's just kind of can you be accurate with your shots. And there's no real there aren't a lot of ways to cheat the system, I would say. And I'm sure as we see more and more I've already seen Tik Tok clips of at the end of a match all four players standing in front of the goal. Like I've already seen some silly [\u00a0__\u00a0] like that, which I could totally see",

It all feels very very like imprecise and that what that's what leads to sort of the magic of it where you there's no real way to exploit a whole lot of things in the game. And it's been fun seeing in real time people learning different mechanics and learning different tricks and learning different like I literally this morning I I get a message from who I've been playing with and he's like, \"Oh, dude, check out this Tik Tok that'll teach you how to do like these special passes and stuff.\" And I'm like, \"What the fuck?\" Like I",

And so like if you're watching the video version, you have you see like the background and like there's a city and all that stuff, but that's all I guess in lore projector or like video wall essentially, right? Like you can and you can kick the the ball off of that wall, which like you want to talk about meta or like the ways that people are building as they're playing, right? Like you have the thing now where you'll have two people running toward the goal and then the first person will essentially kick the ball off of the backboard like on like over the goal to like trick the goalkeeper and then it'll bounce to their teammate and then they'll kick it in.

We're hoping to build this game into the future or whatever. And I totally feel that.

It's offense, defense, and goalie. And whenever somebody scores, it rotates positions. And it just rotates where you start off.

He doesn't need to be in our neighborhood anymore. move to the Beverly Hills of Iraq or whatever. This guy's got like materials I've never seen before. He's got this like cool uh uh that shield wall that I haven't even gotten yet. We need it.",
