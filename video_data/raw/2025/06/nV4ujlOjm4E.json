            "text": "because we got a fun new story coming out for story number two. Nintendo Switch 2's insane first week in detail coming from Matt Piscatella at Cirana. Paris, I got a couple of big bullet points. We're going to go one by one down this lineup right now. Nintendo Switch 2 set a new all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware in the US with over 1.1 million units sold during the week. ending June 7th, 2025, excluding sales from the My Nintendo store. The record was previously held by PlayStation 4. Little clap right there. Congratulations, Paris. The hype, the big sales for us to be expected. I think so. I think Switch 2, regardless of the price increases, was highly anticipated. So, it was not a shock at all that it set records and Nintendo clearly did a great job of making sure that anybody that wanted to get a Switch 2 was able to get a Switch, too, you know, within the first week. So, you know, kudos to them. Look, as as bad as I talked about Donkey Kong a second",

Look, as as bad as I talked about Donkey Kong a second ago, I mean, I love my Switch, too. Um, I I I think it's great. Um, been having fun with Mario Kart. Been tinkering around in Cyberpunk 2077. Jumped into Breath of the Wild playing that as well. It's a great It's a great piece of hardware and Nintendo's Nintendo. They're always going to make great games. So, of course, the hype was was going to be there and like I said, regardless of it being 450 and really 500 with the Mario Kart bundle at launch, people showed up and they went out and bought it. Yeah, they showed up, Paris. And it felt like there was more or a better easily available option to purchase it. I know it was always Mayhem night one, but it did feel like more people bought it than more people saying, \"Ah, I didn't get it. It's sold out. this was whack. I didn't get a hold of it.",

I didn't get a hold of it. And it also felt like my GameStop when we went to it, right, had 102 units available that you could pre-order the following day that weren't just online options. And so, yeah, it felt kind of like the right storm here, Paris, on availability. I think, of course, Switch One heading into Switch 2 had that perfect storm of people know what the console is. They know what the, you know, the idea and the vision is from Nintendo and how this dual handheld/home console was going to be. And yeah, it just feels right for me. And I'm excited to see over its lifespan. Paris, we talk about the Switch One selling so well. I assume I predict that the Switch 2 is going to do the exact same, if not better, because it feels like they're really on the path of nailing what they want to do with this console.",

Yeah, completely agree. Let's go to part two on this one. 79% of US Nintendo Switch 2 buyers also purchased Mario Kart World either physically or as a part of the Mario Kart World Switch 2 hardware bundle pass. I mean, duh. You know what I mean? It was one of the it was the only first party launch, you know, release out of it that wasn't Tears of the Kingdom with an upgrade. It feels right. The game was really good. Mike, you still had uh welcome tour. Okay. like we need to find out what the attach rate is for welcome tour. Put some I I gave him $10. I gave him $10. Put some respect on it, Mike.

Like you said, it was the flagship game for for launch. It is Mario Kart. We know historically Mario Kart has always been one of the the best sellers for Nintendo with a high attach rate to their hardware. So, of course, and making it, bundling it in, I'm I'm like I would be very curious to know what the split was between the bundle and the people that went and just bought it standalone because I would imagine God it probably is what 60 40 maybe even 7030 people just bought the bundle. I mean, why wouldn't you? And again, it was readily available. It was not hard to be able to get. You could walk into a store day one and go grab that bundle.

And also, I have a hard time imagining everybody didn't do that. 79% is very high. I'm surprised that's not 85 to 90 because it feels like it was the game, the only game to buy, but it also was backed up by a number of other goods selling games. And that's our final piece coming from Matt Piscatella. The top three best-selling Switch 2 physical video games sold in the week were Mario Kart World, Cyberpunk 2077, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.

So, you know, in in my day job, I had been traveling like for the couple weeks coming up to Summer GameFest and the launch of the Switch 2. So, I was in Louisville, Kentucky when the Switch 2 came out. I had already pre-ordered the bundle, so that was coming to the house, but I knew I wanted the physical copy of Cyberpunk 2077. So, I went to two different Walmarts and then ultimately a Target to find that physical copy. and it was literally the last one left when when I went in the store because everybody was was buying that physical copy of Cyberpunk. So, I I'm not surprised to see the sales numbers for that.

I mean, and it's it's cyberpunk, man. I mean, it it looks pretty darn good, and it plays pretty darn well on the Switch, too. I was pleasantly surprised. I mean, you play in that quality, not the quality mode, but you play in that performance mode at 40 frames frames per second. Plays great. 720p handheld, obviously, you can do up to 1080p if if you dock it as well. But yeah, really good. Really good. So, kudos to CDPR, man. I'm pretty sure there's some wizards and sorcerers over there.

So, it'll be interesting to see if I buy Cyberpunk 2077 physically, put it in there just for the fun of it to say that it's always in there cuz I love booting up my Switch One and having that copy in there just laughing at it, thinking how cool. But yeah, I mean, incredible sales. On the flip side, I'm always a digital guy, Paris, and seeing Cyberpunk being right there, front and forward on the front page was impressive to see.

If it had a free roam, then it would have been a number one, but I guess it doesn't have that, huh? He loves Cyberpunk. And yeah, Paris, I mean, Mario Kart World, as to be expected. Cyberpunk, a big win right there. I was apprehensive, Paris. I really didn't believe that you were going to show me a Nintendo Switch piece of hardware that could live up to it. And that was also on me. You know, I think we're kind of spoiled here in the studio of watching Nick and Andy do the big Nvidia sponsored streams on the 5090 with full path tracing.

And I will say after watching it run, playing it, it it is impressive, Paris, that this piece of machine can run some third party games that you know during its lifespan I can get I can be a little more confident in my purchases moving forward. Oh, 100%. What it told me was expect every third party public everything's going on here. Look, Xbox is going to put everything on their on on that Switch, too. Every third party publisher is going to get their games on a Switch, too, because why not? if it can run it. We're clearly seeing the amount of of consoles that are already being sold.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, uh, number three on the physical selling list. Paris, did you jump into the upgraded versions of those at all? What did you think? Yeah, so I did Breath of the Wild. Um, that was the one I wanted to to check out uh to play and it's I mean to play it at at 60 frames and it just loads quicker. Everything is just it's just better. I mean obviously the HDR all that visually looks better as well. So the upgrade is good and I did the I did the Nintendo Switch online expansion pass so I got the upgrade for free doing it that way. I didn't have to pay the 10 bucks to do it and looks great. Um so I'm going to play through that for a while. then I'll jump over to Tears of the Kingdom and check that out as well.",
