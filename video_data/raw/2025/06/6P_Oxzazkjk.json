No longer are we in a world where Activision shows up at a couple different places, Bethesda gets its own showcase, and Xbox does its thing. Now, it's all part of one giant experience. Um, featuring a direct after. This is our third year we've now seen this uh this time featuring on uh Obsidian Games is Outer Worlds 2 and the surprise of Grounded 2. Um, overall Xbox Games Showcase.

It was a really nice afternoon being spent with all of you. So, always remember that. I really love seeing games and hanging out with you. But for me on the Xbox Game Showcase, I was going to say this, Tim. Um you know what, the opening was really weak and I think the first party promotion was also on the weaker side. I think first party was lacking this year when we come to promotions, trailers, get hype moments. And so I just didn't feel like the oh snap, Xbox has got the games. We know they have the games, but this summer showcase didn't show we got games, right? And so I'm a little lacking on that one. Also, a lot of the games that were shown aren't my style. I actually come out of this enjoying Jeff Keelley Summer GameFest that had more games that spoke to me than this one. Unfortunately, I thought the",

Unfortunately, I thought the third party support was pretty strong with Persona and Final Fantasy. There was a day back in the day with XCast that Barrett never thought Persona would be on an Xbox. Now we get Persona 4, which is great to see him happy about that. And Xbox fans can be very excited about Final Fantasy coming to their consoles with 16 today and then of course this fall uh we will get Final Fantasy 7 which is like hey finally that's a big help and we knew Phil was bringing that team over to help us out and get over there. Um man oh man Tim I thought we would see more EA or Ubisoft here. We did not see those two big parties present on this. So I thought the overall third party support was kind of mid this year. wasn't blowing uh me away on this one. I also thought that we had a very weak Call of Duty",

That was a crazy way to end this showcase of like, hey, 25 years of Xbox, we got Fable, we got Gears of War, and we got one more that's been with us ride or die. And you're like, okay, Phil, what are we talking about? And then we just got a Call of Duty reveal that was not exciting. Right? When I think Call of Duty, I want guns. I want action. I want COD. And that was not it. Uh, I do want to give major shoutouts to, of course, uh, Obsidian who was putting out three games this year. That should be applauded. And also Clockwork Revolution from In Exile that absolutely showed up with a mega kind of breakdown show up that I thought for sure we'd be showcasing this game for this year with the release date. Kind of tough that it's like, hey, we'll be there when we'll be there. And so this",

Kind of tough that it's like, hey, we'll be there when we'll be there. And so this year for me is falling in the mediocre to okay range, a five to six area for putting it on the kind of funny scale. Uh, like I said, first party, I think Xbox has got ahead of it, saying, \"Hey, we want you to love us again. We got the games.\" And for the past two years, we've seen those games, but they're not ready yet, or we know they're coming. And so, we kind of got to this moment of like, man, how much can we show? We're not there yet. And so, we can show only so much. And so, you got DLCs that will hold you over. When I look over, I I don't want to talk too long, but you look at the end of 2025. I don't think this will go down as like a strong end. It will be a good end because when you really look at it, we have a whole lot of games to play. You're backed up, but I don't I think it's",

So, for me, right down the middle, mediocre to okay, wasn't blowing away. I think next year will be better. Let down on it. Uh before we get to everyone else's thoughts, I do want to say that the homies over at Activision have sent us a ton of codes for the Tony Hawks Pros Skater 3 and 4 Foundry demo that's now available on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC uh for people that pre-order the game as well as select Game Pass subscribers. But if you just want it for free, if you're not one of those people, um Roger is going to be dropping the codes in the chat uh throughout this episode of Gamescast.

Um so these codes they need to be used. tonyhawk.com tonyhawktheame.com/preorder. Go there look at them in the chat. Bless. Yeah. Where you at with this one? Um I will say that I was surprised and delighted um during a lot of this showcase. I would personally give it an eight out of 10. I thought it was a solid great. Um, I go through announcements that were here. Games like Super Meat Boy 3D was a surprise that delighted me. Right. You get to Clock Clockwork Revolution and I'm with Mike as far as, oh, I thought you you would have ended this trailer with a date because this is a longass trailer where you're showing us a lot of the inner workings of the gameplay. And I think my main critique with this trailer is that it",

And I think my main critique with this trailer is that it was a load blown way too early. Like, if this was the trailer you wanted to show, you should have waited until the last last moment. We got to follow up next year with this. It's like you already showed way too much. Like this is the trailer you show when the game is out this fall. Like this is the trailer you show but right before the game is out. And so I think we might have seen too much of it, but I'm not going to complain too much because every moment of this game that we saw was pretty fantastic. Um Ailion from Don't Nod was a surprise, right? Like I know there are plenty of people that love don't nod that are Don't nod fans. But don't nod now means more things to more people as far as you know their history with games like Life is Strange but then like now recently being doing things",

Mudang Two Hearts is another one that uh looks really cool, right? Giving us kind of that like third person action shooter slash undead slash, you know, stealth sci-fi thing. Like it looks like it's taking a lot of inspiration for a lot of different places. But even as we were watching it, one of the things I mentioned is like it felt it feels like we're not getting a lot of games that look like this anymore as as far as like the third person campaign um like action shooter game, right? Like if you're not Capcom, like you know, I feel like we're not getting as many of these. And so this",

It has some Splinter Cell kind of energy to it, but then yeah, a lot of weird supernatural stuff going on. And this looked really cool. And then you get games like At Fate's End and Persona 4 Revival and Invincible Versus and Keeper. Like this showcase had a lot of announcements that really spoke to me, right? For I think for a lot of this is going to be determined down to what is your taste in video games? What are the kind of games that you're looking forward to? And a lot of the games that showed up here are games that I look forward to. I think at the same time for me though I have questions of where was Fable, where was Perfect Dark, where was Eday, where, you know, what's going on with Forza? Are we gonna see a new Forza Horizon type thing, right? It what's going on with",

You know, I I think if I'm coming into this with the mentality of somebody who's a first party Xbox fan, then I totally understand the disappointment as far as what are the big dogs doing? But I think overall though, I had a good time. And I think the only times where I felt any sort of bored was when they were doing what feels at this point like housekeeping. I think we have to have a discussion around the Fallout 76s and the Elder Elder Scrolls Onlines and those the Sea of Thieves the games that you know are mainstates because they're at every single Xbox showcase and I understand that. But those are the parts where now I'm like every time I'm like all right cool like Sea of Thieves is back. We know we're going to get an update. Like I understand why you talk about it but",

Like I understand why you talk about it but I get bored. Like that's just the reality. you bring that up cuz I think they've finally found a a better rhythm for them. They're shorter, they're in, they're out. I think back in the day we used to clump them all together and we would really sit there blessed. So, I think you know their main stays. They're going to be there. And if you're a fan of that, you're excited, right? Because these games are getting content. They're staying in the mix. And I think they've done a better job of like, let's space them out. Let's get in. Let's get out. Sure, fishing stayed at 12. Fishing did not get in, but like Sea of Thieves that came in. It showed you smugglers, got you out and made a way out of its way. ESO, you probably don't even remember what ESO showed you because that's how fast it was, right?",

And also the there's a there's a argument back and forth of which had the worst ending between this and SGF in my opinion. Right. SGF at least we got Resident Evil 9 which is exciting, but the the buildup to that was terrible. This year the Yeah. to Mike's point of, oh, we got something, you know, that's been with us since the for for the history of Xbox and you have a really really cool cinematic opening and it ends up being a Call of Duty. I understand Call of Duty biggest game of the year every year. The it is a fantastic cinematic, but it is a big letdown when I am looking at this trailer. I'm like, \"Oh, what is it? Is it a New Prey? Is it Perfect Dark? Is it a weird fable thing? Like, what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is",

I think this was them showing you, hey, you should be interested in the in in our campaign. Like I think this was their attempt at saying, \"Hey, that thing you've been drinking, by the way, sugar-free, caloriefree, would you believe that?\" And you go, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] I I didn't know it was so delicious. I think the trailer looked awesome. It it looks great.

Clockworker Evolution looked fantastic like you had mentioned uh at Fate's End was it? Um and the that the Mudang game of course looked really really fantastic but there was also just a lot of you know Planet Alana 2 was such an awesome little announcement to happen.

But just real quick like one thing that I think is important to note and I think it's just weird because they had the the inerson on or sorry not in person the on on site on camera uh bits with the the you know with with Sarah and Matt and and Phil. All of those I feel like they didn't really do a great job of making it clear of what exactly they were talking about. It kind of just feels like buzzwords buzzwords. But the quote here that Phil said was in 2026 Xbox will have a new fable, the next Fortza, Gears of War Eday, and the return of a classic that's been with us from the beginning.

Sarah Bond talking about Silkong a whole bunch and then us being like, wait, did you know, did she mean later this year that the game is also coming that year? I think the the ROG Ally Series X or whatever they're calling it got me really pumped up as somebody who is, you know, three plus years into owning a Steam Deck and I still love the damn thing, but I would love more power at this point. And when early on when we're hearing about this Xbox handheld, I go, \"No, that sounds like an absolute no for me cuz I don't want to just use the Xbox launcher.\" The fact that this is going to be this Windows mobile thing, including every launcher that you could want and it doesn't just look like a Windows desktop, you know?

I mean I don't Epic is missing. I feel like that is something that could easily be done with with this sort of launch. I I either way I'm like, \"Oh, this really really turned around my hype levels for what this handheld is because I'm always caught in between that weird area of like my Steam Deck has all of my my Steam games.\" And yes, I can easily put a Ubisoft loader like I tried doing with Prince Persia Lost Crown before they eventually went to Steam or I could get the Epic Store on there going through the desktop mode or whatever.

It's just it's annoying, right? This seems like this could be the solution. And immediately turned around how hyped I was and I think it looks awesome and the UI looks really sick. I imagine the other launchers are going to work just through Windows, right? So like Epic should work. Yeah. Well, and that's kind of what I'm assuming is like I'm sure there will be a solution there. Maybe it's just Epic didn't agree to the marketing or the mentioning or whatever.

I really thought that if we ever did it would be a game pass deal and it's not these. It's not Game Pass. It is coming to Xbox. You have to buy it. Um and Xbox 16 or sorry, Final Fantasy 16 Complete Edition coming out today. That's awesome. I want to see that game find as much success as it possibly can.

Um, and I am very excited that they did talk a little bit about the Xbox OS and that they're taking that stuff seriously because I think that that is very very important for um the strategy of Xbox to be successful. And I think that it's proving to be successful. This was a very, very, very good show of just showing that they have a ton of games, a ton of great partners when it comes to Persona and Final Fantasy.

Like, this isn't Xbox. This is Obsidian. And then also, of course, Doom and Sent Midnight and stuff we've gotten, right?

No State of Decay. Yeah, that was surprising. That's That's a really good point. Crazy. It was odd that it was shown last year after what we knew about the studio and what was going on inside of the wall. So, it was like, okay, that's interesting.

Yeah, I can't imagine uh Matthew Griffin, who was the the lead PR of that as well as the lead PR of um the other very Hollow Knight looking game with the Crow Mask. Well, Crow sworn. Um I got to imagine the DMs are blowing the [\u00a0__\u00a0] up right now. We'll see. Mhm. Uh RDJ says, \"No Starfield DLC or PS5 launch date. pretty surprising, right? But I like it's weird because I think I I was bringing up that, you know, are we going to get PlayStation being named here like, you know, or are we just going to see logos? And that was one of the discussions and we did get Gears of War remastered saying like it's going to be playable everywhere to everybody on whatever you know and if PlayStation's really the only place that Starfield is not at, I wouldn't I'm not surprised that you aren't on an",

It's also going to be on PlayStation.\" I'm not super shocked by that. I am surprised by a DLC sort of announcement and I think that we'll get whatever Starfield DLC or or Starfield on PlayStation news in a press release or in a tweet or in a whatever some sort of announcement maybe Gamescom the DLC. Uh and then we got uh Cody Brandon saying no Starfield DLC in Elder Scrolls 6. I think the show is crazy. Also, Obsidian going hard to clean the slate almost guarantees they're making Fallout, right? I feel like Fallout's common. Um, but yeah, Elder Scrolls 6, like no one should have expected to see that here. Yeah. No, Starfield. Yes. I I I'm surprised it wasn't here. No. Replaced.

They were playing it. Oh, well, I'm bad. My bad for giving up hope. I'm a bad replace team. I mean, well, I have Well, you know what? I'm thinking of the other game. What was the game that was announced in like 201? That's what I'm thinking of. No, Replace is the one that looked like the last night. I was like, oh, cool. We're getting a different dev working on this on a a game of that style. Uh, and then I played it and I was like, h, combat's kind of whatever.

Lucky if we ever get another just Crash Bandicoot game that isn't uh what was it a uh it's about time moa. Oh, Crash. We'll definitely get Crash Rumble. So, well good time. We were number one. Yeah. Top team NA. And then we played a team that knew what they were doing. Turned it off. Started the next game. Uh, Alec Taylor says, \"So, is this Xbox Play Anywhere just cloud gaming or do you natively play Xbox games on it?\" And this is what I was talking about of how confusing all this branding is.

So, Xbox Play Anywhere just means that you could buy the Xbox game via Xbox and you can play it on your PC or your Xbox or get rid of that device. You got to get rid of that. It should just be your Xbox. You can't play it on PlayStation. Like, that's PlayStation does not is not part of Xbox play anywhere cuz that's not how that works. Is Nintendo part of Xbox until they put their games? No. until they have that feel. When did play anywhere start? I feel like was that one Xbox was a cloud thing. No, no, you're right. It's PC. Exactly. And the cloud's a separate thing. And then then the the RO the Xbox ROG the Xbox ally uh can natively play Xbox games. It can also remote play via the cloud. Yes, they got to get rid of it because of like cuz this is the reason why you're able to play Xbox stuff on this one is because Xbox partnered but also it's just a PC thing to download the games.

But that's been true for all Xbox games, right? Since they've introduced Play Anywhere, which is why they keep pushing that. Yeah, I think it was it was a marketing push that made sense when it was new back in 2013. I don't think we need to keep pushing it now. I agree. I like it. No, I think Yeah, you're going to push this forever. They're welcoming you to the ecosystem.

Like that's where I 100% agree with Tim where you have Xbox play anywhere like in between all these trailers and I'm like I know like I already know that I can play the stuff anywhere. I feel like you just have to I think I feel like people at this point understand that when you buy something on Xbox that means you're buying it on PC as well. I don't know. I think they're going to be I think they're going to say this for the next five plus years. They'll probably say this forever. Bless like they're getting a new fan base. They're trying to garner a new fan base to come in to a losing platform that was Xbox proper with the consoles and say, \"Hey, we're here.
