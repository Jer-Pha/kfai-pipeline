And as a kid, I was like, \"Oh, I want a character that has no weaknesses.\" Yeah. And so, I always picked Mario. Um, but before I played Mario Tennis, I had Mario Kart and Bowser was my first main in Mario Kart cuz he was heavy.

Can I Dude, can I tell you I got two things? Firstly, I might have to go back on a critique that we had yesterday on the Games Cast about this game where one of our one of the things we talked about were kind of the lack of distinction between u a lot of the a lot a lot of the tracks like it doesn't feel like there's as many standout like oh this is like one of a kind kind of track. As I went through each of the Grand Prix I found more and more tracks where I was like oh no this is memorable. Oh no this is like you know there's this got the sauce. This track has the sauce. Right. So, I think maybe the more I the more we play this game, the more we're going to start to hit that like memorable status. So, that's first and foremost.

And just like started clicking on the tracks individually and seeing that like if you click on a track, you have like six different routes you can take to all the tracks that are surrounding you. Like it's kind of crazy when you see how they actually lay it out. It's really cool. I I was starting to notice that earlier when we were doing I was doing Grand Prix with just uh I assume a bunch of best friends who jump uh jumped into my room and I was noticing like when we're selecting each track for the Grand Prix, we're always selecting the next match is always uh going uh going to a place that the last course just went to.

Not so much the a factor for me anymore. I feel like really. Yeah, it's a little bit more even keel. Yeah. And yeah, that's what we were talking about yesterday on like kind of our impressions after like the first day, right? Um, it feels like a lot of the design philosophy around this to me at least is a bit more leaning towards that kind of chaotic party uh vibe of Mario Kart just with like the amount of uh players this time around the items that they've brought back from like other Mario Karts uh past and stuff uh seems to be a bit more of that chaotic uh I need a vibe. Yeah, it's like let's make it more fun than competitive. Yeah, maybe it's true. There will",

There will definitely still be that competitive kind of vibe to it, like uh people figuring out like the the wall driving and grinding and like the kind of strategies with all of that stuff, but I think overall um at least early impressions still cuz I've only had two days with this at this point. Yeah. Is that your plan for the weekend? I I think so. Too fast. But it was also just like seeing Blessing like start up Wind Waker. I'm like, [\u00a0__\u00a0] do I want to replay Wind Waker and starting up Breath of the Wild? And seeing Breath of the Wild in like 4K 60 is like a [\u00a0__\u00a0] all this is all really cool right now. I wasn't like super stoked cuz I don't have anything that I'm like dying to play, but then I was like, what? But what if I did? Yeah. What if I did start my new Animal Crossing island? Um, then",

Yeah, [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah. It's so good. Treasure Tracker is so good. Um, someone this game or someone said Juna says, \"I feel like being a great driver almost doesn't matter.\" Yeah. And I and I think that was kind of my point that I don't know if I uh said well yesterday, but like the more traditional like being good at cart driving from what we've known for Mario Kart 8, um it's just different this time around. And so I think like the kind of what is considered to be a great driver in this game, learning all the other new strategies, I think is going to be the the big point here.

There's just like a lot more options which again to me feels a bit more because we have more options feels uh a bit more of that party vibe. Yeah. Well fun. Oh yeah. Keep hitting that question block. It's going to get you more coins. Oh, perfect. Yeah, sometimes I'm just like I don't have the brain power to think about all the things I need to think about in general, but also in my game. Who's your main? Uh, I'm Or do you not? So, for Mario Kart 8, my main for 150 was um Link. I liked Link's speed. Um, and then 200, he was a little too fast for me for 200, so I went with Shy Guy cuz he had like more of a kind of balance uh speed and acceleration and all that stuff. Mhm.

So, maybe one day they add like other like more grand Nintendo IP into this later on. DLC maybe. But um yeah, so right now I'm just sticking with Jai Guy cuz that's my little that's my little buddy. That's my little dude. Um yeah, I haven't unlocked nearly enough to really get into the the minutia of what I like in terms of feel.
