Of course, I'm your host, Tim Gettys. I'm joined today by Andy Cortez. Hello, Joey Noel. I have served. I will be of service. Yes. And Nick Scarpino, the Baba Yaga. God, that's what they call me here. I love it. Every time Baba Yaga is said, I'm just like, and even when it's like not in John Wick, when I just hear it out, I'm like, \"Oh, wait. How often do you hear that word out? You know what's surprising about like Babaga? I never heard it in my life till John and now it's like I would say once every three months. Yeah, there's that too.

Um, it's something you got to do before you watch this movie is remember you're watching a John Wick movie because, you know, midway into John Wick one is when you start to fully understand the tone and what they're going for. And when you're watching this movie, I just obviously I love these movies so much, but I kind of forgot what movie I was watching. And so when I you just have to understand humans will never act like humans in this. This is a fantasy movie. These are characters that would never ever exist in real life and",

I I forgot to say spoiler thought right now until we make it very clear we're going into spoilers. Spoiler spoilerree. So in the first several minutes of this movie, I'm like, \"Ah, this is just not this is weird. I'm not really vibing with this.\" And then it kind of kept on going and I was like, \"Oh man, I think I I think this is where the love of John Wick ends.\" And then it just it just bullet train full speed ahead. And it it's a great freaking time. Awesome movie. Love the action. Love the set pieces. It has I I think some set pieces that are better than ones from the OG John Wicks. Like I I love this movie.

Not just the fifth one, a spin-off. A spin-off fifth uh entry into a franchise. Of all movies that I love, I think this movie kicks a lot of ass. A little bit too loud in the Dolby though. Like, why are the punches louder than the bullets? The shots. The shotgun shells. The shotgun shells moved my feet. Whoa. Great time though. Had a blast. I highly recommend this. I want to go watch it again because Blessing was like, \"Oh, I got to go see it.\" He was like, \"I need just like dudes to go see it with though.\" I was like, \"I'm down to see I want to go see this again.

She doesn't really I don't I think a lot of the movies that I've seen her in, I don't think she's been great. So, I was a little bit hesitant going into this movie. That being said, Andy's point about nobody in these movies are ever going to talk like a normal human being means that is she fit in perfectly in my opinion. But the really more important thing is is like at the end of the day, you're going to see a John Wick spin-off movie. You don't really care if the acting is good. You're there for the action. And she like kicks ass. She's really fun to watch. I feel like they did What are you doing? Oh. Um, I feel like they did a good job of giving her her own style. I think the thing that I had to",

Uh, and obviously you see that play out in the movies and stuff like that and it's like he's can he be stopped? He is unstoppable. And that's not who Anodis' character is. And I feel like that was the thing that I had to remind myself of like she's not this like menacing figure with this lore and like uh larger than life kind of thing. Um so that tonally is like a little bit different and I feel like that's kind of where I was in my head a little bit. Um and I because the other thing that I really preached about John Wick too is uh all like how accurate all of his like tactical gun movements and all that stuff is.

So, I think it's like a really good uh tangent, I guess, for the John Wick franchise. A lot of there's a lot more interaction of characters than I expected. And I had a I had a good time. I think I'm going to end up seeing this with my dad for Father's Day. I think that's the the rewatch move. The barometer for me is a here's a great question from OMJ OMGX in the YouTube chat who asks, \"Here's a question, Andy.

And you use the word spin-off, which obviously this is a spin-off, but I I that was going to be my biggest worry going in of being like, okay, are we going so far? We're spinning this off. We have to make it our own. We have to severize from all the things that made the John Wick universe outrageously stupid and fun. And no, this feels like I mean, these movies are video games, right? They're just really, really, really, really dialed in shooters. And this feels like really, really, really good DLC that they made that you could make an entire game from.

I think I think last two mainly because like I feel like enough of him in one like I was really I'll always remember like Alfie Allen, you know what I mean? Yeah. So yeah, he was always that character in that time period. Yeah. Who who what should we put? Uh the chancellor and cultists. I think that's what his name was, right? The Chancellor. Yeah. And the flamethrower guy. The Chancellor. Mini boss. Flamethrower. Mini boss. Oh, yeah. I'll put that, too. You have to look up on the wiki how to take him down. All right. Now, it's time to rank the movies. Currently, at number one, we have John Wick four. At number two, John Wick one. Three, John Wick 3. And four, John Wick 2. Who wants to start? Such an interesting ranking. Is it? For some reason, I thought that I that John Wick 3 was at the bottom and I was the only one fighting for it, but happy to see. I was wrong about that. Where do we want to put the ballerina? I would",

Where do we want to put the ballerina? I would put this at number five. I would too, which sucks, but it's not an indictment on the movie. No, this movie kicks so much ass. It is the fifth best in five movies that kick so much ass. Yeah, I feel like it looks like it's bad at five, but like the the point spread between these movies is not that big between one and five. Honestly, I am aligned with y'all. I do think that this is the least good of them. Um, but there's so much going for it and I think a ballerina 2 could be lit. I don't know that we'll ever be four in my heart. Four to me, right? Every scene in that movie is perfect. That's that's it's kind of the gold standard. And I think what I am so stoked about is I wasn't really really sure that these movies could be as plug and playable. You know, I know that the with the show that",

You know, I know that the with the show that was coming out, it's like can you do that really without Keanu in there? And this movie proved that if you have the right cast and like the the same sort of mentality with how to make these movies and the touchstones of a guy named the eye with a bunch of telescopes and he's a character and you have all these random factions with their cool gimmicks. It's like the it can't be plug-and-playable with the right quality. This movie has the right quality. It rules. It kicks ass. See it in theaters. Yeah, I back all this up and again just to just to back up Joy's point, we're talking like all these movies are like nine out of 10. This one might be like an 8.95 out of 10. It's not that far off of enjoyability from everything else. It's similar with how I rank them. I try to go about it like with this",

I try to go about it like with this pseudo mathematic fashion where it's like, you know, I think about my my favorite Mission Impossible movies or Fast and Furious movies and it's like, well, those two set pieces were amazing, but this one might be the like I do think that the grenade sequence in this and a lot of the flamethrower stuff you would pull for like an ultimate or and I would say are even are better than some of the set pieces from the John Wick movies, period. Like I think that like the John Wick movies are still, you know, maybe they have the best set pieces, but their lesser ones are not as good as the ones in this, you know. Totally. Movie rocks. Movie rocks. So this is number five. Dick, you didn't say Oh, yeah. You you agree. I would say number five. Yeah. Great. Uh so number five, the ballerina. Uh like I",

I'll finally finally after over 10 years of uh making content with Nick and Greg uh see the origin of Superman. Superman. Not yet. Well, at some point you'll see it in the second one. Yeah. So, we'll see how that happens. Uh but until next time, remember everybody, we're going to be back live uh leading into uh PlayStation State of Play and then we're going to react to it and then we're going to break it down in a Games Cast. Then we're gonna go offline, but we'll be back later in the night uh when me and Greg go to the Nintendo store and then after that play Switch 2 all night long. Till next time, love you. Goodbye.",
