Patch 1.1.2 2 for Mario Kart World hit Nintendo Switch 2 consoles recently and with it came a few minor adjustments to tracks like Boo Cinema and Dino Dino Jungle. However, many players have taken to Reddit and other internet sounding boards to voice their displeasure with the match as it seems to have made some unwelcoming changes to online play.

You know what I mean? They're definitely not. Multiple users have revealed that patch 1.1.2 makes it more difficult to have the standard threelap race when playing online with friends. Matchmaking, it seems, prefers uh what have been dubbed quote intermission races or races where drivers must instead ride through the open map from one track to another and then run a single lap on the new track. However, before each race, players were allowed to choose a track. Uh, and it was discovered that the quote random option would always choose a track for a standard threelap race until this patch changed it. Now, while the random option still sometimes offers a threelap race, intermission races have become more prevalent since the patch was pushed out. Mike, are you familiar with this whole thing?",

As part of efforts to make the endgame more enjoyable, the PVE area near the shield uh wall has been expanded to cover row AD and half of E within the deep desert. Compare that to PvP and PvE are balanced uh now uh where only row A is PVE and that's essentially switching half of the deep desert from PVP to PVE. I don't I don't",

And at the start of it, they made the first think uh battleships, right? The first row here on that was all PVE, meaning, hey, here's a safe spot for you to venture into the deep desert, kind of get your feet wet, understand what's going on here. And then the rest of the grid was PvP, where it's like, hey, when you get in here, it's all on, right? We're going to battle for the best resources. We're going to we're going to bang into each other, and you can come back in here and have the PVE experience. Now, they want to expand that PVE zone because there's two things with this story, right? That's a PvP server. That's a PvE server. Maybe if players want that PvE experience, you should be on a PvE server. Also, that's up to the devs of like, hey, make it more\n really dialed in on this one, right? On those two categories.",
