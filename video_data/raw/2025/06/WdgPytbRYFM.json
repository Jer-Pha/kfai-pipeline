It was that idea of like when I was playing Death Stranding 2, I was like, \"Yeah, it's more Death Stranding.\" So to see all the reviews when people were like, \"Oh, but they improved this or they got rid of this friction point of that.\" I was like, \"Oh, I don't. This is the rose tinted glasses of what I remember Death Stranding one to be for you Tim and for anybody who didn't catch it yesterday.

And I would contribute a little thing here or there. Week three, which was when I put in the bulk of my review time, they had turned off servers. So, it was just me. So, it's like, do you want to build this road? Nothing is in it. I'm like, well, no, because I don't even think I'm going to get back to this in the review period. Da da da. So, again, I'm very excited to do more of the side stuff and flush it out more. Again, that's where the 85 comes in.

And of course, the clips I'm sending around and the references I'm making. Like again, this probably sounds too hoy toy, but I think games in general are art. Clearly Kajjim was trying to make something bigger than a game and I think he achieves that with Death Stranding 2 and that's why I think it's an 85 even though I don't think the boss fights have it like they used to.
