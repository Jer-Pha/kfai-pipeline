How are you? I'm doing very well because I was scared that a friend of mine was lost forever and we may have found him. We may be able to save him. James Burke, in 2006, I made a little me, a Nintendo me of this face, Greg. All right. I mean, I've seen it. You shared the when you were looking for him. It didn't look that much like you.

It's like a golden brown, you know. Golden brown, though. Brown's where we want to emphasize here.

And again, like I So can I get a I know you're doing the fun synopsis here. I need the more in the weed synopsis cuz for me my Greggy me is still my icon and all that jazz, but when I went into some switch to submen, it did say create a me and it had nobody there.

I'm very sad about that. So I went on a spiritual journey first to find myself. Then after that, I went on a internet journey to find my me. And lo and behold, I found him on the old Nintendo Network site. It's not the Nintendo account site. It's the Nintendo Network ID site. All right. Okay. And I found it.
