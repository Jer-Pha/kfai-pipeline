I sent it to assets and I was like, if you are a a sicko who likes root beer, show yourself. Cuz we were driving up the coast of California. If you drink root beer regularly, show yourself, you sicko. Driving up the coast of California, past an A&W, which I didn't know these things existed anymore, let alone one tucked away here in California. There's one singular one. I think I'm saying I'm already making my point. Here's root beer [\u00a0__\u00a0] But it could also be bad. Mug exists. We all understand that.

And I, you know, I'm being a bit over the top as I tend to be, Nick. It's why I was trending gamer. But it's that idea of like it's just mindboggling to me that root beer exists out there and is making a killing enough that there's multiple brands of it because I just don't ever hear anyone sit down and order a root beer.

I'm like, \"Oh my god, I don't know.\" Anyways, though, Ghostbusters Afterlife. Oh, let me let me epilog it. Sorry. So, yeah, last weekend I was like I trying to find these Superman toys. We I I don't want to I didn't want to order off Amazon. I wanted to walk Ben down the aisle because, you know, we get there and it's usually like you can get a car, you can get a thing, and instead be like, \"Look at all Superman [\u00a0__\u00a0] We can get it",

Uh, and so like it wasn't there and I was like so bummed about it. And I got in the car and I'm like I need to tell somebody this and I know how stupid it is. Like I know and I'm like it's a heart head thing. I'm just like I it doesn't matter. I don't care. But I was like I am legit. When they weren't there I was legitimately crestf fallen that they weren't there about the Reddit and the Instagram and blah blah blah. And so like uh it was just so heartbreaking to have that and I was like one of my comparisons was do you remember right when we had Ben? Obviously, you all remember cuz you went, but Ghostbusters afterlife had just happened and going down that Target aisle and having all the Ghostbuster mint on card and like Jen has",

When Ghostbusters [\u00a0__\u00a0] Frozen Empire came around. They just [\u00a0__\u00a0] put out the goddamn There's Gaka. Look at him. They just put out the [\u00a0__\u00a0] family again and they didn't even carry those in stores. I had to order all I got those from the people. Kevin says, \"What kid wouldn't want to play with the entire Spagler family?\" No, no, it's I said that on purpose because it is such a joke. So funny. It is like you break these people out. You're like, who are all these nameless white people? They just all mixed together. You know what I mean? I could not have named a single one of them for the life of God.

That is a great outlet you should be following on Instagram, on wherever you can get your Ghostbusters news. I was looking at all the tadam stuff that came out this weekend and they were talking about Stranger Things and I was like it's crazy that this show started before I lived in San Francisco and I've lived here for like eight years now. Damn, that's true. Oh, that's I still living in Orange County when I tried to watch Cameron says he is he was at the dumb thing. Yeah, nice. He's in the trailer. I have not watched the trailer yet. Chris Anka in my brain I don't watch trailers until Tim tells me I can watch trailers cuz we have to react to them. Very true. And then I forgot Tim's not a",

But what Jen was like, I'm in the mood for something spooky. And she was like, what if we rewatch 28 Days Later? And I was like, you never have to ask, but so I don't burn you out. Let me make sure it's not an interview. And then when I looked through the interview schedule and it wasn't on interview, I got so offended. We have a new [\u00a0__\u00a0] What the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Tim? You know what I mean? Anyways, we watched you guys would want to go to Huh? What's that? I said, \"Is that a screener you?\" Oh, yeah.

I was like under no circumstance. And I was all stupid. I'm like cuz I'm an idiot. And Jen's like I'm like, \"Oh, I guess I could go get the D.\" She's like, \"We're upstairs. There's no DVD player.\" And and I was like, \"You're right. Plus, it would be shitty quality of the in like the the movie was still garbage like whenever 2000 shot as a independent movie or whatever. It's like crap. Yeah, they shot that. I want to see they shot that on like a digital video camera of some sort that was like proumer. It's [\u00a0__\u00a0] great. And obviously it's just Killian Murphy is just so goddamn good in it.
