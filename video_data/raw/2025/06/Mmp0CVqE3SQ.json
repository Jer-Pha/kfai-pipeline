Of course, I'm your host Tim Gettis. I am joined on this beautiful Tuesday by Blessing Adi Jr.\n Good day, Tim.\n Good day to you. How you been?\n I've been pretty good. Been playing different games. Of course, our Death Rating 2 review was yesterday that people can check out now.\n But I I I I've been spending a lot of time in this first half of June playing that, going all in, just playing Destiny 2. Uh and I beat it about a week ago. And since then, it's all been it's been rematch, which I've been loving. And we'll talk about I believe the rematch review is\n doing almost a million others.\n Yeah. Yeah. Me and Yeah, I mean me and almost 2.5 million others.\n Oh wow. Wow.",

We'll talk about that later.

I don't want to spoil too much cuz I do want to go back and watch and see what everyone gave it. But what did you give it cuz I know I was talking to you the last couple weeks and you were kind of in flux just a little bit.\n Yeah, I gave it a 9.5.\n Okay. 9.5.

There's things here and there that I that I wish they could have done better, but overall I'm still like blown away by it. It's one that I I say this all in the review, right? But if you're a Death Star rating fan, it's a mustplay. And if you're a Cojima person, I think it's one that you definitely should check out. I think even if you didn't like Death Rating one, it's not like this game is a different type of video game than Death Rating One. It's still that type of game, but I do think they do a lot to kind of bring the barriers down and smooth out the the friction that's in Death Running One. And so it's definitely one worth checking out.\n Yeah. Uh I I was off yesterday cuz I I just had some uh things I had to to handle with G.

Microsoft will conduct another round of major layoffs in its Xbox division next week as part of a companywide reorganization. Managers within Xbox are expecting substantial cuts across the entire group, according to people familiar with the plans, who asked not to be identified, discussing non-public information. The company declined to comment. This will be the fourth big layoff at Xbox in the past 18 months following three major cuts last year and the closure of several subsidiaries. Xbox, which produces video game hardware and software, has been under pressure from Microsoft executives to boost profit margins since p purchasing Activision Blizzard for 69 billion in a deal that closed in 2023.

I do think that we are getting closer and closer to that point because we've talked about this ad nauseium, but like Xbox is finally at a place where it has its different systems in place, making money, and they have a steady cadence of releases coming out to back up the Game Pass subscriptions, which subscriptions is the future they keep talking about.
