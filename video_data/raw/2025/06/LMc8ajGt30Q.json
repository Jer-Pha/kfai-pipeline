As of writing, the only confirmation is that the game is quote in development. The brief reveal trailer was paired alongside the Silent Hill 1 intro theme, further confirming that this is the original game in the Legendary Horror series being remade. Uh, Roger. Oh, yeah. Right.

Um, which I assume this is the most logical game. Again, I'm not a Silent Hill person, but to your point of, you know, you prefer like the going in order. For me, this strikes me as very similar to what Metal Gear is doing with Metal Gear Solid Delta. How that game, Metal Gear Solid 3 is of course the third Metal Gear Solid game. It's the first one we talk about chronologically because it's a prequel. Um, but that said, I think Metal Gear Solid 3 is a fan favorite.

Um, but you know, when I look at Silent Hill versus a Metal Gear Solid, right, I think the things that these remakes have in common is that they're looking at PS2 classics first and now like I think for Silent Hill, you that looking it up, right, that game came out in 1999 for the PlayStation one, which automatically You are born.

Quote, \"We really appreciate all the longtime fans of Metal Gear Online, who have always wanted to see it make a a comeback, but the landscape of multiplayer games has changed a lot since MGO,\" said Sahara. It took a lot of careful consideration to think about what the new online mode should look like based on the iconic stealth and survival elements of the Metal Gear series. We're taking camouflage and hide-and-seek to the next level, he added. We challenged ourselves to make something unique that's more than just another shout out.

A lack of reviews ahead of its launch, coupled with higher-ups leaving the studio with days uh to go until release had people worried Minds Eye might have issues. Now, it's finally here, and it has taken a single day for some of its players to start asking for refunds. While most players issued uh most players issued refunds haven't shared the platform on which they've been playing Mind's Eye, it's the ones who are claiming they're getting their money back on PlayStation and sharing the evidence to prove it that will be the most concerning for the game's devs. PlayStation has a very strict refund policy that's usually pretty difficult to take advantage of.

Even though PlayStation's support page makes it clear that you are not eligible for a refund if you've downloaded and played a game, anyone who requested requested a refund for Cyberpunk during its Rocky launch period was issued one. What's worrying for Mind's eye is that shortly after PlayStation issued Cyberpunk refunds, it removed CD the CDPR game from its store for 6 months. Jesus, an unprecedented move that against all odds, Cyberpunk has managed to back bounce back from. Minds Eye hasn't been delisted yet, but evidence that refunds are being issued is starting to appear. Master of Mughals 1995 shared evidence of their refund on the Mindsey subreddit. The player highlights the promises of 60 FPS and Minds Eye being pro-enhanced and not being fulfilled.

In their example, the PlayStation employee notes that it doesn't usually issue refunds for a game once it has been downloaded.
