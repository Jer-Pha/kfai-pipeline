God or Satan's with me today, y'all. Um, a lot of people have been asking what the plan uh for this in review is going to be. And I'm going to be honest with you guys, we are trying our best to week to week figure it all out because my goal is to have this group of people on each episode and sometimes with scheduling that can get a little difficult. So, the plan is starting this week, every single week",

Let's have another conversation. But like when there's a dead spot in a few weeks and months, years when something toss it in there. Let me go. Let me go, Andy. Let me go. The official line now after I talked to you and confirmed the right I agree. It's the right call. No. So, you're thinking, see, real quick, you're thinking I'm saying we should not watch Superman 2. We should watch Don cut. I'm saying I want in the future there's going to be a gap in a week. You know what's going to happen? Fast and Furious going to get delayed again. Tom Cruz is finally going to die doing one of these stunts. You're going to need to fill a week. And I'm just saying that's when we do",

I'm down for I don't like to do that cuz that's future spoilers for when I make you watch that one, too. That's not going to happen. I I will not be a part of that. What we're doing is Superman 1, Superman 2, Superman 3, Superman 4, The Quest for Peace. Yeah, please. Thank you. You have to give it a religious name. Then we are going to do the new Superman movie and then returns will be after that just because that's how weeks and schedules are working out here. Um, what about steeles spiral agent?

All right, cuz he didn't know he was from Project Cadmas, right? And so, the idea is that it gets revealed in this whole thing there that he was a clone of they used some of Superman's DNA and some of this guy who worked at Cadmus' DNA. Then they retcon it years later, make it half Superman's DNA, half Lex Luthther DNA. [\u00a0__\u00a0] insane. But number four, in fact, was Steel. John Henry's John Henry Irons there, right? He just [\u00a0__\u00a0] was he Superman saved his life on a construction site one time, but it turned out he was like this super he's a super genius. He was working construction because of whatever.

And I I need all of you to know, not only did I not know that Shaquille O'Neal's steel is related to DC or Superman at all, I also my entire life thought that steel and shaft were the same thing. So definitely different. And that's why I was like like what? Like I was thinking Shaft Shaft's not related to Superman. No, everybody. Um but yeah, we will not be doing Steel in review. Maybe one day when we have an open week in Tom Cruz's dad, Greg, but no. So, I hope I'm clear here.

The Omen. That's right. Oh, in 1976. Then then what else did you make that you love? Well, you made the Weapon. There it is. Great.

This thing had a whole bunch of [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] before it ever got to Donner. Donner took it over. They kind of knew each other.

So it's this huge deal. It's a massive [\u00a0__\u00a0] deal because by by union rules if someone else had shot the majority of the film they get director credit.

But Donner talked about the fact that was filmed in Calgary and not only was it filmed in Calgary, it was filmed in well they chose Calgary cuz like where does it never rain? We need to be able to shoot on this day. They then had to go and plant all that rye. Wow. Months before so that it would be there when they needed to film it. Like I Christopher Nolan shoot interstellar. Exactly. Like insane [\u00a0__\u00a0] But anyways, like one of the things he said was talking about that part of the trilogy being a Norman Rockwell painting. And I think that's why there's so many amazing huge zoom outs where you just see like how flat and loseresque Kansas is but beautiful and like all this sky and them talking and it was Calgary so it's not that.

But he cuts himself off and to not put that on Clark and to still like there's so much said without saying it and like the love between them and like yeah you were you were put here for a reason and it's not to score touchdowns.
