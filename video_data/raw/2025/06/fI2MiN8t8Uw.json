PlayStation published. PlayStation loves fighting games right now. I love it. That's why they got the fighting stick. They bought EVO. So, I don't know if you've heard of Project [Music] Defiance.

What a fun unique style. Like that's so great. In the chat, Hi Qual says, \"Lame short documentary. Just go read the PlayStation blog. You don't deserve to enjoy anything. Just go away.\" The inspiration for working on this project really came from a place of pure fandom and wanting to say why isn't PlayStation in this space. So PlayStation approached us with this vision to bring Marvel back to the forefront of the tag fighting genre. Lucky idea and that got us really excited because we had worked with them before on successful stuff like the Marvel Spider-Man franchise with Insomniac. When it came to approaching Marvel, you have to kind of first float the idea and let them know, hey, you know, we're thinking about approaching a company like Arc System Works to make a fighting game.

It's always refreshing to work with a team that will take on the challenge of tackling Marvel, putting their own spin on it, and they're just uppercutting that challenge into the stratosphere. And that's what you get with this team. I mean, they couldn't make something boring if they tried. Dude, this changes even like now that I think about EVO like after this is going to be the tricky thing is that most combining including myself sacred communities between artists to work stuff and then the partner that's crazy enough to take on the task because you either do something like this big and bold and don't do you know like that that's so mess I have a grasp on their art",

You come in with your kind of own expectations of here's what I would expect to see from Arc System Works when they take on a Marvel IP. And what came up was something that went beyond that. Damn, I know Capcom's pissed. Capcom finally sound finally saw the ex like get married on Instagram. They're like, \"Damn, it really is over after they released all the remasters for Marvel Capcom games, all the collections. I remember personally the first time I saw Iron Man was really when I felt we had something special. [Music] Iron Man is supposed to be the sleek fighter jet.

Also, this is a great collaboration. Also, when Arc looks at these Marvel characters, it's not somebody else doing the also the gameplay mechanics rivals thing. Yeah. Like this is going to have such a different like this is a game that lasts an entire generation. You've seen tag fighters that have 2v2, 3v3. We felt like we just had to go 4v4.

So you could either duke it out as just the leader and three assists or you can tag in your assist to swap the leader and change the match up. I don't think a lot of people thought this day would would be here would come. You know, this has just been an awesome journey and I'm excited that we get to be able to share it with all the fans out there. I'll tell you right now, a lot of fighting games, they never get to experience this level of production and it's just a dream to even be working with these two great partners.

Y'all know that a few months ago, my life changed forever when I brought a pair of XRE1 AR glasses on a long flight to New York. I legit could not believe how easy it is to use and high quality my experience was playing games, watching movies, TV shows on the plane without just too much extra stuff around me, or especially not a giant goofy headset around my head. No joke, this is my favorite new tech product in years, and it has earned a permanent spot in my travel bag.

It's a 4v4 tag battle fighting game coming to PS5 and PC in 2026 from Japan to the world. Wow, what a pitch perfect game announcement. I loved how they did this. What a genuine surprise. Game looks freaking fantastic. Has such a to take Marvel these days and have a unique take on it. I think is very difficult.

I imagine this game is going to have that similar thing of trying to trying to appeal to the hardcore uh uh players that are coming off of being in the Marvel C versus Capcom community or the Arc System Works games communities, right?

Like I'm so fascinated by what other decisions are you going to have as far as like is there going to be a story mode situation? Cuz that would be such a slam dunk. There has to be, right? I would hope so, right? Like I think there have been so many strides in story modes and fighting games in the last generation and a half that it would be such a slame dunk to have that. But did Guilty Gear have uh do they do story mode stuff there? Yes, in the more old school traditional way. Little tiny things. I feel like Fighters was kind of the same way, right?

Um but I think here you would be more incentivized to appeal to a western audience as far as what you do do with a story. Like I hope they look at either Tekken and Mortal Kombat and go, \"All right, even if it's short, even if it's a two to three hour thing, like let's have some cutscenes with dialogue and like give you a unique story in the Marvel universe cuz not many people get the chance to do this.\" So, I hope we see that. And also, I'm just very excited to see what this roster is going to be because 4v4 is insane.
