            "text": "For me on the Xbox Game Show Showcase, the opening was really weak and I think the first party promotion was also on the weaker side. Also, a lot of the games that were shown aren't my style. I thought the third party support was pretty strong with Persona in Final Fantasy. I also thought that we had a very weak Call of Duty reveal. That was a crazy way to end this showcase. This year for me is falling in the mediocre to okay range.",
