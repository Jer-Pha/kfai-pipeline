I can't wait for later, but I am excited to talk about games with you this morning. Now, why can't you wait for later? Oh my god. Are we going to talk about Death Stranding like the rest of the world's talking about? Definitely going to talk about Death Stranding, too. So, of course, that's that's the reason we have you in town.

So, I can't wait to talk about what I think about this one, the new I'm really excited to talk to you about it cuz I it's funny one came out. It was 2019, right? It was like November. I was coming off of playing Pokemon Sword. Um, and I like I remember putting in probably around 20 hours into it and I just fell off cuz my brain just didn't click. And then the Steam deck came out and I believe it is the director's cut that's available on Steam. Yeah. And the director's cut, I think, just fixed any issue that I had with Death Stranding because like that is when I fell in love with it and like that's where my excitement for Death Stranding 2 when that got announced just",

So, like it speaks to some people and I love that more people now get to experience the first one even though the second one's out and then people are going to be like, \"Let me see what the first one's about.\" They got a lot of ways to do it now.

Per Kevin Lopez of Game Sandwich, the Xbox Quest S3 or sorry, 3S uh will be announced on Tuesday, June 24th. The device will reportedly cost $3.99, $399, and include an Xbox themed black and green headset with matching accessories such as an Xbox wireless controller and an Elite Strap. It'll also include 3 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Like the original MetaQuest 3S, it'll have the same 128 GB of storage. Despite the recent reliability of uh the source of the information, it should still be taken with a grain of salt until officially announced or independently verified.

What does that do for you? Uh, I'm going to be honest, not much, but I I will say this cuz like I'm a mainly PlayStation gal, so like I have my VR 2, and I was uh I was hesitant to see what other I'm a let me take a step back. I only play Beat Saber. That's the only thing I go to VR title. Understandable. That's it. So, like, and I was a little bit bummed to hear that Beat Saber was getting like no more updates for PlayStation, which sucks because we've bought all this these these tracks and things and we're not going to be able to get the new stuff. So, now what I do with my library that I have here. Um, but for me, like it doesn't do much. If anything, like I think it's a positive thing cuz like it just gives more",

If anything, like I think it's a positive thing cuz like it just gives more gives more access to Xbox titles in new ways and it sort of it's not surprising since the ally the rag ally is something that's already getting the Xbox treatment already. Yeah, I think for me it's a I come out with a similar similar takeaway, right? As far as like this being another step into what the new Xbox is like all the walls coming down, Xbox being like, yo, our ecosystem is one that we want people to come through and partner with and like in the way that ROG, the ROG Xbox ally is going to be a way for you to have the Xbox experience on the go.

I find it fascinating because I don't I don't expect any VR software output from Xbox first party. So like really like what they're doing here is just another they're I think they're viewing it as just another screen, right, of hey like Xbox Game Pass like you can play you you know you can play your flat screen games in VR as well as your VR games this massive display right so like it makes that that does make sense and that's in a way like now that you say it like does excite me to like know maybe that would be a selling point for me like instead of having to play on my tiny monitor like let me put on on this massive 100 inch screen in this virtual space and play this game this way.

Like is this in the cards in the same way that PlayStation has done the VR stuff? And I remember the interviews Xbox being like, \"No, we don't really see like, you know, that as a future for us in terms of like the viability of us leaning all the way into that market.\" This is one of those cases of being able to have your cake and eat it too where, hey, we don't have to dedicate a big portion of our hardware support and a big portion of what would be expected as software support and like having to develop games for this thing and doing all this stuff to VR.

Sell it with months of Game Pass and also um bundle in an Xbox controller. Call it a day.\" It's smart. Like it's super smart. It's something that I think even on the PlayStation side. I wouldn't be surprised the bet with PSVR 2 and I think somewhere along the way they probably knew that the bet wasn't going to pan out in the way that they wanted it to, right? Like I feel like the lack of first party support for VR 2 past like that first month even, right? Like already says volumes in terms of how early PlayStation was like, \"Fuck, this is not the investment that we wanted to make here.\" But hey, we're already here. So put out the VR2 hardware, let it be a thing. It'll connect to PC later on. like we'll figure this all out kind of thing.",

I this feels like a way more feasible and a way more I think tenable way of doing this for everybody involved where I think even on the meta side, right? Like you're looking for more reasons for people to want to pick up a Quest. You're looking for more reasons for people to be interested in the hardware. I think being able to again slap an Xbox logo on it and like have this Xbox collaboration thing happen with it makes sense for opening this up to another audience to maybe have interest in this device. I agree. So this isn't this isn't a thing that you think you're going to ever pick up? It depends. I don't know.

So, story number two, Microsoft adds Steam games to its Xbox PC app on Windows. This is from Tom Warren at The Verge. And the reason why I bring it up is because this could solve all my issues. Yep.
