Following in the footsteps of the 2023 Starfield Direct and the 2024 Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Direct, this year we will again have a double feature with the Xbox Game Showcase immediately followed by the Outer Worlds 2 Direct. It all begins with the annual Xbox Game Showcase bringing you a look at upcoming titles from across our first party studios. In addition to incredible new titles from our thirdparty partners across the globe, this year the show will be digital only.

That's true. Are they really getting out of this? And I think I've seen community members already stepping up and doing a community. I think also possibly we see a similar thing that Sony's done in the past and and other outlets where it's, you know, the green screen presentation thing, but then, you know, introducing the next game would be here's a dev with not a whole lot to say, but it's",

Sure. So then let's do it. Let's get into our predictions. Each one of us will bring five predictions to the desk right now. Andy, one thing I do want to call out is that once you put this set up and you get the green a flowing on kind of funny, you can't keep Paris Lily away. True. As much as you want to, as much as you try to, it's bad. He infiltrates. So, I do have Paris's six predictions. Six predictions from Paris. I love that. I love that. Um, and then Mike is sick, so he sadly can't be here. Yes, you can't keep him away. Just let him go to Disney land and lick everything and lick everything.

And then you take over under. Here's my thing. I think logo wise, yes. But like my one thing for you to make this like spicier, will we hear the words PlayStation even once? Cuz I think that's where I'm a little bit more trepidacious. Okay. Well, that that's where I want to like lean back a bit. That's where I want to like, okay, I'm cowering.

Thank you. Why? Uh, I think I'm trying to I'm very much uh cribbing the homework from Starfield. Remember when they did the Starfield Direct? Obviously, they then put the date on it there, which was September 5th, 6th, 7th, somewhere in there or whatever. So, I'm picking the Tuesday that I think lines up with that to get that out.

Where would I put that?\" See, this is fun cuz I do have a theming for my predictions, at least for a portion of them, because I've now started remixing some of these because I want to get more exciting. But the theming overall for my Xbox predictions is that 2026 is a banger year for Xbox. And so to start off, we're going to start off with Out of Worlds 2 since Greg mentioned it.

Well, see, I'm trying to spice up my predictions. I understand. I hear you. What what exactly do you think we get delighted by in this in Outer Worlds 2? Oh, I like that question. Um, have you looked at the IGN coverage? No. Okay. Sadly. So, no. That's good cuz I I think IGN's coverage you go, \"Oh, like I perked up listening to Michael Haim talk about it because I'm already somebody who's I'm all the way into Outer Worlds",

Yeah, permutations like conversation stuff or like you know knowing the engineering stuff or whatever. So like I think maybe more permutations as far as that stuff. I'm sure that's already been covered and so people people in chat are probably going to be like oh they've already announced that. But I'll say that I'm going to say they show us some kind of dialogue sequence and like show us how things can go differently.

He went there and saw a bunch of stuff but didn't get to play it. For me, I think the the surprise and delight of it is going to be how good combat is. I think combat's going to look good. I think guns are going to be more crunchy. I think melee is going to be more physical. Even me listening to the stuff, I didn't watch a lot of it cuz I wanted to have that reaction to the direct. It already looks miles better. Obviously, that just comes with time and that comes with engine upgrades.

Like there's like they turn shadows off. Like there's a lot of moments like that in the game.

Not that that's a problem, but we got Oblivion. We're getting Gears of War. That's the thing is I say it even though like the reason why I say out this fall is because it's been rumored for so long and it feels like they've been working on it forever. It at the same time doesn't make sense cuz like would you drop it at the same time as you're dropping Outer Worlds 2?

I think it's like in the same way that Oblivion is. Exactly. Exactly. It's Unreal 5 running on the Fallout 3 thing so it all looks beautiful and yada yada yada. Mhm. But I think what's different here is you are trying to hype the people who love the Fallout TV show. When the Fallout TV show hit, everybody was caught off guard and everybody went to play Fallout and there was no new Fallout. So that meant Fallout 4 spiked through the roof and New Vegas was suddenly super popular again. Even 76 got this huge breath of life, right?

But that's not the spirit of this. I'm sticking to it. I'm wasting one of my spots on something that bless Lock [\u00a0__\u00a0] in. Rare replay. with Donkey Kong 64 coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, baby. I don't think it's time.

Uh, I see weiner says, \"Will snowike Mike be around tomorrow night?\" Hopefully, we're going to check in with him and see how he's feeling. He's in the Iron Lung right now, you know, trying to get back on his feet because what's tomorrow night, Tim? Switch to launch party, baby. Hanging out right here, Twitch and YouTube. Kind of funny games. Kevin, Kevin, you can throw up the blue sky putting assets. We can officially confirm we are streaming from the Nintendo store. So, tomorrow at 7:45 Pacific time, uh, we will go live, probably Roger, hopefully Mike, in the studio, then kick to Tim and myself and Kevin behind the camera over at the Nintendo store as we build up to that 9:00 launch from there. So, we're very, very excited for that. Pretty cool. Like, I I doubt anyone else is going to do this just because we're so",

You just told the story recently, Greg, but 10 years ago, we were like the first people to ask um who even was making Rock Band at that time or Guitar Hero Live Activision. Um we're like, can we do a let's play and just post that as our preview? And they're like, that's weird, but sure, why not? And it's our to this day most popular kind of funny games video. Uh this feels like the same thing of us being like, can we live stream from the thing? Which doesn't sound like that novel of an idea, but I don't think anyone else is going to do it. And we got approval. So, Greg and I live streaming from the Nintendo store in San Francisco for shenanigans. Lots of high jinks and shenanigans you want to see as we build up to buying.

Uh, if I hope Mike doesn't isn't here sick. Yeah, I will be masked up most likely if Mike ends up showing up. But if you get sick, can I go in your place? Of course. Okay, cool. With nothing stopping me. CJ Splitz on says, \"Will games be reintroduced with PS5 and Switch 2 logos?\" That's what I'm most interested to see is like how they handle all that stuff. I don't think it's going to be a big pomp and circumstance, but that's and we also have Keyy's show that I do think can handle some of the heavy lifting of just hey, these games are also coming to different platforms.

I will say Paris Lily on u one of these social media apps uh said there's too many uh did say that this showcase was going to be another 9.5. I love that when he said it last year he was right. I hope so. And also that at this point if Xbox has a bad showcase that is entirely on them and they [\u00a0__\u00a0] up. They have so much. They just have so much like they have too much.

Again, like I'm in a weird spot right now as I'm more Xbox than ever thanks to Play Anywhere and the the ROG talking to the Xbox Series X and trading my saves back and forth and doing all that.

My number one and two game of the year so far, South of Midnight and Expedition 33, both from the showcase last year, right? I mean, I get South Midnight's been in a couple as well, but like Yeah. Wait, South of Midnight's your game of the year. Oh, sorry. My number two you Expedition 33 and South of Midnight. Yeah, he said it opposite and I was like, I'm not crazy, right? Okay, fine.

Starwolf says, \"All I want is Halo Master Chief Collection in Gears of War on Switch 2. I don't care what they add to Game Pass or Xbox consoles. Just port every 360 game to Switch 2.\" Yeah, it might be a little too early for the Switch 2 stuff, but maybe not. Yeah, that was my I put, you know, I tacked that on there for Starfield. That's why I really pushed it out to Winter because if it's not if it's just P if it's just the DLC/update and a PS5 version, that could happen imminently, right?
