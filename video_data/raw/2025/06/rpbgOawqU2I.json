Now it's all part of one giant experience. Um featuring a direct after. This is our third year we've now seen this uh this time featuring on uh Obsidian Games's Outer Worlds 2 and the surprise of Grounded 2. Um overall Xbox Game Showcase, what are your top level thoughts? Snow bike mic. Oo, Tim, coming to me first, of course. Uh, top level thoughts, Tim. You know what? It was a really nice afternoon being spent with all of you. So, always remember that. I really love seeing games and hanging out with you. But for me on the Xbox Game summer showcase, I was going to say this, Tim. Um, you know what? The opening was really weak and I think the first party promotion was also on the weaker side. I think first party was lacking this year when we come to promotions, trailers, get hype moments. And so I just didn't feel like the oh",

And so I just didn't feel like the oh snap, Xbox has got the games. We know they have the games, but this summer showcase didn't show we got games, right? And so I'm a little lacking on that one. Also, a lot of the games that were shown aren't my style. I actually come out of this enjoying Jeff Keelley Summer GameFest that had more games that spoke to me than this one. Unfortunately, I thought the third party support was pretty strong with Persona in Final Fantasy. Uh there was a day back in the day with XCA that Barrett never thought Persona would be on an Xbox. Now we get Persona 4, which is great to see him happy about that. And Xbox fans can be very excited about Final Fantasy coming to their consoles with 16 today. And then of course this fall, uh we will get Final Fantasy 7, which is like, hey, finally that's a big help.",

Um man, oh man, Tim, I thought we would see more EA or Ubisoft here. We did not see those two big parties present on this. So, I thought the overall third party support was kind of mid this year. Wasn't blowing uh me away on this one. I also thought that we had a very weak Call of Duty reveal. That was a crazy way to end this showcase of like, hey, 25 years of Xbox, we got Fable, we got Gears of War, and we got one more that's been with us ride or die. And you're like, okay, Phil, what are we talking about? And then we just got a Call of Duty reveal. That was not exciting. Right. When I think Call of Duty, I want guns. I want action. I want COD.

And also Clockwork Revolution from In Exile that absolutely showed up with a mega kind of breakdown show up that I thought for sure we'd be showcasing this game for this year with the release date. Kind of tough that it's like, hey, we'll be there when we'll be there. And so this year for me is falling in the mediocre to okay range, a five to six area for putting it on the kind of funny scale. Uh like I said, first party I think Xbox has got ahead of it saying, \"Hey, we want you to love us again. We got the games.\" And for the past two years, we've seen those games, but they're not ready yet or we know they're coming. And so we kind of got to this moment of like, man, how much can we show?

We're not there yet. And so we can show only so much. And so you got DLCs that will hold you over. When I look over, I I don't want to talk too long, but you look at the end of 2025, I don't think this will go down as like a strong end. It will be a good end because when you really look at it, we have a whole lot of games to play. You're backed up, but I don't I think it's missing one piece to be like that was a really good another year to end this off, but we have so much games. We know there's more games coming. So for me, right down the middle, mediocre to okay. Wasn't blowing away. I think next year will be better. let down on it.

Right. you get to clock C clockwork revolution and I'm with Mike as far as oh I thought you you would have ended this trailer with a date because this is a longass trailer where you're showing us a lot of the inner workings of the gameplay and I think my main critique with this trailer is that it was a load blown way too early like if this was the trailer you wanted to show you should have waited until the last last moment we got to follow up next year with this like you already showed way too much this is the trailer you show when the game is out this fall like this is the trailer you show but right before the game is out and so I We might have seen too much of it, but I'm not going to complain too much because every moment of this",

Um, Ailion from Don't Nod was a surprise, right? Like I know there are plenty of people that love Don't Nod, that are Don't Nod fans, but don't Nod now means more things to more people as far as, you know, their history with games like Life is Strange, but then like now recently being doing things like Banishers and then also Justant. Uh, I'm somebody who's always, you know, on the lookout for what this studio is doing next. And this game looks really different and really cool and I like the direction of it. Mudang Two Hearts is another one that uh looks really cool, right? Giving us kind of that like third person action shooter slash undead slash, you know, stealth sci-fi thing.

And so this looks cool. It has some Splinter Cell kind of energy to it, but then yeah, a lot of weird supernatural stuff going on. And this looked really cool. And then you get games like At Fate's End and Persona 4 Revival and Invincible Versus and Keeper. Like this showcase had a lot of announcements that really spoke to me, right?

Are we going to see a new Forza Horizon type thing, right? It what's going on with anything Halo? You know, I I think if I'm coming into this with the mentality of somebody who's a firstparty Xbox fan, then I totally understand the disappointment as far as what are the big dogs doing?

Like I understand why you talk about it but I get bored. Like that's the reality. bring that up cuz I think they've finally found a a better rhythm for them. They're shorter, they're in, they're out.

Fishing did not get in like Sea of Thieves that came in. It showed you smugglers, got you out and made a way out of its way. ESO, you probably don't even remember what ESO showed you because that's how fast it was, right? And so I think they've at least done better at how they show that is right. Yeah. And also the there's a there's a argument back and forth of which had the worst ending between this and SGF in my opinion. Right. SGF at least we got Resident Evil 9 which is exciting, but the the buildup to that was terrible. This year the Yeah.

I understand Call of Duty biggest game of the year every year. The it is a fantastic cinematic, but it is a big letdown when I am looking at this trailer. I'm like, \"Oh, what is it? Is it a new Prey? Is it Perfect Dark? Is it a weird fable thing? Like, what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is this?\" And it turns out to be a Call of Duty Black Ops thing. I love Call of Duty Black Ops, but I don't think this is the way to show this. I think this was them showing you, hey, you should be interested in the in in our campaign. Like I think this was their attempt at saying, \"Hey, that thing you've been drinking, by the way, sugar-free, caloriefree, would you believe that?\" And you go, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] I I didn't know.

But the quote here that Phil said was in 2026 Xbox will have a new fable, the next Fortza, Gears of War Eday, and the return of a classic that's been with us from the beginning.

I really thought that if we ever did it would be a Game Pass deal and it's not these. It's not Game Pass. It is coming to Xbox. You have to buy it. Um and Xbox 16 or sorry, Final Fantasy 16 Complete Edition coming out today. That's awesome. I want to see that game find as much success as it possibly can. Um the Tony Hawk stuff obviously I'm going to pop off for the secret characters and the the three new levels look awesome. Um Ninja Giden getting a date. It looks great. It's like there is a lot of stuff here that is cool, but to",

Um, and I am very excited that they did talk a little bit about the Xbox OS and that they're taking that stuff seriously because I think that that is very very important for um the strategy of Xbox to be successful. And I think that it's proving to be successful. This was a very very very good show of just showing that they have a ton of games, a ton of great partners when it comes to Persona and Final Fantasy. Um, ending on Black Ops. Again, I think it's the placement more than anything that's the problem there. That is interesting.

So, if they can focus more on that stuff and actually like tell people, hey, we we're taking this stuff seriously and so should you, I think that's cool. But not as a show closer for an Xbox showcase when we have so many cool games to talk about. Um, I do think they're definitely teeing up for an amazing 2026 after an amazing 2025. I'm not taking away from where they're at here. Um, but yeah, them hyping everything up for next year. I think it's going to be a banger showcase next year. It's really interesting to me. Uh, I know we're all giving our quick thoughts and we're trying to keep it short, but you guys not really mentioning many first party titles, right?

Like feels like we missed on that front for an Xbox showcase. Yeah. Well, it depends on them not, you know, if the games aren't ready. I think EDAY I'm more and more thinking that Eay will be a game that they shut off that initial teaser and we won't see that for a couple years. Like I'm getting I'm closer and closer to that sort of line of thinking in a similar vein to where you get a little tease of Wolverine and Wolverine's been gone for a long time.

I think my thing is I I came into this not really having the big expectation for all right, what are the the surprises that we don't know about? I feel like there's I feel like there's a good majority of Xbox studios that are working on games that we already like know what they are. And then the ones that we don't know of, they just released games. Like I don't I don't know what could have been here aside from an Ever Wild or like if Rare decided to scrap Ever Wild and they were doing something new that could have shown up as an Xbox first party thing that I would have wanted to know about.

And then as far as the things that we do know, I am like where are those things? But at the same time, going back to the predictions that we did last week for Xbox, my big the theme of my predictions was that Xbox was going to have a banger 2026, I'm coming out of this showcase being like, \"Yeah, Xbox is going to have a banger 2026, right?\" Like, when I'm thinking about 2025 for Xbox, I'm like, \"Man, this this is Obsidian. Like, this is Obsidian's year.\" Like, this isn't Xbox. This is Obsidian. And then also, of course, Doom and Southern Midnight and stuff we've gotten, right? But like, you know, I feel like we are I feel like right now Xbox is loading up. I don't want to compare it to the Dominoes cuz I'm tired of the dominoes. the dominoes on the table.

But yeah, 2026 feels like I guess a landmark for where we're at with the dominoes falling. Yeah. I mean, I got to bring up one thing that I don't think we've said so far on this show. No State of Decay. Yeah, that was surprising. That's a really crazy. It was odd that it was shown last year after what we knew about the studio and what was going on inside of the wall. So, it was like, okay, that's interesting. I mean, you could go down the list, Tim. Where's Contraband? We talked about that partnership with Avalanche. State of the decay is one of those. Of course, you look at uh I mean, Perfect Dark. Why do we keep showing Perfect Dark? Why did we show gameplay last year if we're not going to be getting into it?

And it feels like like Blessing's saying, we've shown you these, we're loading them up for a big 2026, 2027. Are we holding things back for a Gamescom or a Game Awards? And then of course we know they kick off the year with ID at Xbox the IND whatever the the developer direct. There's like they already have a lot of announcement moments here and it feels like now we're kind of spreading them out and maybe that's where we see some more. I think we'll see Fable at the Game Awards. I think we'll see something big for Fable at the Game Awards. I mean Crow in chat says where is OD? That's another one. It's interesting that he doesn't bring that up at all. He has been on stage. He has talked now and it's like, \"Oh, we're talking about this.

I'm telling you, it's Death Stranding 2 marketing and and the Fizzen announcement. That's a separate thing that's announcing a many years down the line ending a state of play. Like, we'll get OD. I think OD is going to be a very small project that there's just going to drop. I imagine that maybe I'm wrong about this, but I see that as like a 10-hour thing at max. Wow. But but yeah, I agree with post death training too. I think that's when you start to actually talk about it more. Uh, a couple super chats that I wanted to get to here. The House has spoken says, \"Could have been a nine out of 10 show, but ending with Call of Duty is total whiff for me. Eight out of 10.\" Uh, Bobby Joe says, \"Where's Fable?\" I feel like we didn't expect Fable to be here. The vibe of this office",

Uh, Matt Sanders says, \"I'm so sad we didn't get to see Silk Song. I just want the constant demand to end. Um, yeah, it's we saw we saw Yeah, we we did. It's just like it's that weird thing coming out the same day as the Xbox Ally X, right? Okay. What was that phrasing? Yeah, let's talk about this playable day one when the Xbox when it releases on the Xbox all is how I took this later this year. Cuz I took it I took it as it was gonna be a launch.
