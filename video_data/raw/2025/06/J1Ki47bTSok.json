All building up to uh my new video essay dropping this Friday titled I Replayed Every Naughty Dog Game. We've already got Crash Bandicoot on Monday with Tim. Yesterday we had Blessing try out Jack and Dexter the precursor legacy. He's never played it. I know, right? He didn't know Daxter was a human. He didn't know Daxter was a human that turned into an oddsole. I did tell him about the the fun Easter egg at the beginning of Uncharted one where the wet suits that they're wearing as oddsoles. That's really cute. Uh, and I I knew that about him or I I assumed that about him that he hadn't played it and I knew I was like he would love this game. He would him and I being the 3D platformer collector like I knew he would really gravitate toward uh towards it and so yeah, that was a fun time blessing checking uh that out",

I'm excited for this big old video essay we're getting. This is a lot of fun and I'm excited to play Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception as as the headline says, the best Uncharted. I'm excited about that. We're going to get into that. We're going to get into all those conversations there of Uncharted 2 versus Uncharted 3 and the original Uncharted trilogy and all that.

Uh and I think that would be uh fun for them to check that that out. And the mission I have for you or the uh the thing that I need you all to dude chat is to hold them accountable cuz I see in my mind's eye 5 minutes into this stream tomorrow where I'm off and I I can't supervise that.

And so, you know, there's always been a a kind of uh a back and forth of like which is actually the better Uncharted game. And from my The answer is Golden Abyss. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Uh, from what my understanding though, right, Greg, is that your argument isn't that Uncharted 3 is leaps and bounds better than Uncharted 2. Your argument is that they both should have been a 10 out of 10. Roer should have just done it. Well, I don't know what he was thinking with Uncharted 2 in this 95 business. You know what I mean? It's a great game. It's another masterpiece that's held up to this level. And again, I think there's also the argument that if Uncharted 3 had been Uncharted 2",

They're also my my downside of Uncharted 2 and my disappointment in Uncharted 2 was that it was just so Uncharted one again. I just didn't like Nate and Elena are apart now they're back together. The whole thing happens. There's a supernatural twist and this is what we're doing. And then guess what? We all end with Nate and Elena back together. I was like, \"Yeah, this kind of feels by the numbers.\" So, Uncharted 3 being that buddy cop comedy a little bit more with Sully and stuff.

And uh for me personally, not hit as hard. I feel like the creepiness of the Uncharted one stuff like hits way more. Well, I mean, and think about too, like if you had the chance to when I was reviewing Uncharted, I did not expect it to go supernaturally. It was never something they talked about. They never teased that. They never like really I mean you can make the argument that like well they copied Indiana Jones in a lot of India but like it wasn't they never showed their card.

And the reason I want you to start this one up is I've heard the story time and time again of oh you you do the preview of Uncharted 1 and you see Nate's pants are all like wet and like the the technical prowess of uh you know Naughty Dog doing their very first uh PS3 game, right? But I don't feel like I've heard you talk about your first experience with Uncharted 2 cuz yes, there is like like you said, if like Uncharted 2 and 3 had flipped, the jump from Uncharted 1 to either of those games would have been big and all this stuff.

So like take me back. Where were you in 2009, what was your biggest like what were your memories of starting up Uncharted 2 uh for the first time? Uh yeah, 2009. Uh I'm working at IGN, of course, and I didn't review Uncharted 2. Uh the story goes, of course, is that I wouldn't have reviewed Uncharted 1. Uh Uncharted 1, I was still very green at IGN, and this was the biggest review I had been put on. Uh and it was strictly because Roer had to go on paternity leave. Roer went and had the misfortune of having a child. Uh, and so when Uncharted 2 came around, he was very much like, listen, you know, you shouldn't have gotten Uncharted one, so I'll take an Uncharted 2. And I was like, I got it. I understand. I respect that. And so, you know, this",

And so, you know, this is in a different time. I Roer was already hard at work on his review. I forgot how many burned discs we got cuz that's how it was. But I remember eventually stealing away and bringing a test unit home and starting it there. And yeah, from that onset, the train sequence we're about to begin to your point, like whoa, like this is so much bigger than what Uncharted was. They are doing something so different here from what Uncharted one was. Like obviously it's the same DNA, but it is more budget, more understanding of what the PlayStation 3 was. I think that's another reason Uncharted 2 stands out, I think, to so many people the best is because it's their favorite. And so for a lot of people, it was their first.

Whereas Uncharted 2, we' already had the price drop, I believe, in the PlayStation 3 at this point. Yeah. They're starting to grow their audience with there was an install base for people that were like, \"Oh, I want to jump into this and go with that.\" Yeah. So, yeah, that was it. So, I got to go home and I play it. But again, it was that thing of I remember coming in being like, \"It's awesome, but I feel let down.\" You know what I mean? I felt like I was actually I It's interesting.

You know that. It wasn't what Nate was meant to do. He's meant to fly. Yeah, he's meant to fly. All right, shut this up, Greg. Let's go. Because it it really hit me this time cuz I I've been also uh vocal on other pieces of content. Not to spoil too much of uh what I'll talk about on Friday.

We stopped by the one of downtown San Francisco and found fans and media ready and waiting for to see snippets of Nathan's latest adventure. There were speeches, many Chicago hot dogs, copies of Uncharted 2 for everyone in attendance in a multiplayer tournament. Don't believe us? Check out these photos.
