It just says why why do you put it's been claimed in there? Rumorly rumored. No Naughty Dog has been No, I guess it's been claimed was needed. The Zelda movie has a release date and a Hogwarts Legacy expansion has been cancelled. We'll have all this and more because this is Kind of funny games [Music] daily. What's up everybody? Welcome to Kind of Funny Games Daily for Friday, March 28th, 2025. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside comedian, writer, and the man who made Greg Miller what he is, Mike Ducker. Hello, Mike. Hello. Hello. I I I don't think the last part's true, but Hello. Up at Noon changed the game for me. All right.

We pitched it to Harper Collins and um they bought it. So what it basically is was um I've been reading a lot of books about movies and music where people write about how they influence their lives like Patton Oswalt Silver Screen Fiend, you know, uh a lot of like I don't know even like Chuck Clustermanman stuff that we all used to like and people just don't really do that about games or at least there's no like book where it's just sort of like about a very on the ground how it influenced my life in a funny way book.

And so, I wrote this book, which is a series of comedy essays about events in my life where I've humiliated myself in some form with video games. Um, the story is about like crushes that failed, bad cosplay, uh, a time at Nintendo when I got shot during a paintball gunfight. Um, it's just it's kind it's supposed to be a very, very fun, light book about video games and how much we all love them. I love that. Uh, of course you sent me a copy of it. I got to read about it. I was selfish and jumped right to the IGN chapter. I wanted to know what you thought. Uh, it's an it's it's a lovely book, Mike. You should be very proud of yourself. I hope you are.

I think uh the fact that it it I sent one person at Nintendo a PDF and then I think everyone at Nintendo got that PDF and the fact that they've been very nice about it is very nice. Uh if you want a non-PDF version, maybe a hard coverver, maybe Mike narrated the audio book on Audible, you can go to kindof.com/drucker. That'll take you to the Amazon page. You can pick up Good Game, No Rematch, A Life Made in Video Games. I do have bad news, though. Uh, when you sent me the PDF, I sent it over to Nick Scarpino on Slack and I said, \"Hey, Nick Ducker wrote an autobiography. There's a chapter on IGN/upaton. It's very sweet.

And hell, my favorite part of Animal Crossing was building that museum. Like I that that was what I was obsessed with when we were all having the pandemic was making my museum look good.

Number one, Naughty Dog has been working on an unannounced game for three years. It's claimed. This is Grant Taylor Hill at Insider Gaming.

However, a recent claim from an insider might point to Naughty Dog working on something else in secret. Per recent report, it seems Naughty Dog has a game in the works that has been taking shape for more than three years, and it's being led by Shaun Es, uh, who formerly directed Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. Uh, the claim that Naughty Dog is working on an unannounced game uh that has been in development for three years comes from Daniel RPK.

What are they thinking in this economy? Good lord. Not a good time. Not a good time. Don't make games, people. Are you surprised that if this rumor is true, it's not Last of Us Part 3, though? I guess maybe that's the thing we've all talked about, right, of well, Neil comes out of the gate years ago and is like, well, me and Hie have an idea, but it's more. And then he's like, well, it's just an outline. And then l don't hold your breath for it, but we have Intergalactic. We I would think many people would think you'd switch back to Last of Us there.

But I think that's better than something like, you know, um one of my favorite games is uh that vampire game uh Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines. And that RPG came out before Halflife 2. That game was a Source engine game before Halfife 2 came out. Yeah, that's how old it is. And the sequel has been announced again and again over the years. And it's been announced, then it's been cancelled, then it's been moved to a new team, then it's been delayed. And to me, that's no different than being like, there might be a Last of Us 3.

What's interesting to dive in is say, okay, well, it's Shawn. And of course, Shawn I've known for a long time through Naughty Dog. Saw him at the Last of Us premiere on Monday real quick just to hey, hello. Met his wife for the first time. But Shawn had been at Naughty Dog, then he had gone over to Chris Dynamics, then he' come back to Naughty Dog, right? And so clearly he's been I'm on his LinkedIn.

And then of course directing, writing, Last of Us seasons one and two being such a big part of that. you really wonder, okay, cool. Underneath him, obviously there's Kurt and there's a bunch of other people who have been doing games over there and stuff, but how much of that is trickling down to other people working on other games and doing other things.

And I think, you know, Ducker, to look at PlayStation's lineup, you the main pe thing people throw at is where are all the exclusives? I'd love for them to come quicker. Yeah. I mean, you know, and maybe it is something like an Uncharted and they just don't want to announce it to avoid, you know, cancelling and rebooting it and of course or getting brigaded by because Nathan Drake's too old or something. Well, I mean, that's the always the push and pull of like how you how you do this, right? where if you were to announce that whatever Sean's working on is an Uncharted, it's not Nathan Drake, it is whatever similar, you know, Lost Legacy.",

Yeah, that's all well and good, but that gets in the way of Intergalactic, right? And so, I really think back to Uncharted 3 that had, of course, the Last of Us Easter egg in the bar with the newspaper and then when they dropped the Ant videos uh teasing that they were going to announce something, we were all like, \"Oh, man, it can't be Naughty Dog.

What do you see in terms of okay we want to be able to create something but we've made something so successful where it is something like the Last of Us. It is something like Uncharted. Audiences want that but you have a team that maybe doesn't want to touch that. How as a creative what does that look like? I mean that could look like a couple things.

You know, going back to Miiamoto's whole thing of the game being inspired by exploring like caves and gardens near his house as a kid. I think that that quality is what I want to feel like. I want to feel like I'm discovering something new. Like with the Super Mario Brothers movie, that felt like I was playing Super Mario Brothers. They were doing back flips. They were jumping off blocks. And I felt like a little kid again watching it. And I kind of want something that evokes that feeling, but the feeling that Zelda gives. That makes sense.

I think Ocarina of the Time is both probably the easiest to convert into um a movie, a Zelda movie in terms of like capturing the spirit of it, capturing the progression of it, you know. Um I also, you know, I could see something that's more Breath of the Wildy. I just see that as a maybe a little too vast. Mhm. Like Ocarina of Time's a little bit smaller. The beats are a little bit quicker. It's also I know that this will be a live action film, but it's a little more broad and cartoony and I think that might play well. That's the other thing is I kind of hope that we still get like weirdo characters and it'll be a fine line to balance. And they sort of mentioned",

Um but yeah, I think I think Ocarina of the Time Ocarine of Time if they did adapt one, it would be the best. What I don't want them to do is my pet peeve with any sort of video game movie or adaptation in general, which is like when they have to add lore on top of the lore. Like it's okay if there's like a new event in the story that creates new lore, but when they're like, \"Now we're going to have an ancient curse. Uh we're going to have another ancient thing. We're going to have another thing over here. And there's a reason that the Master Sword does this.\" Like like they did with the Mortal Kombat movies where they added",

I'm I'm you know I you and I are from a different time. So I'm still cautiously optimistic about this. Like video game movies are great now. Not everyone, but most of them, right? Where it's like Ben, my son is obsessed now with the Sonic movies and I watch these. I'm like, \"Damn, that's a good movie. This is funny. This is great.\" He loves Mario, which I loved. I I enjoyed in the theaters, but he like loves just watching. I find something new to find every enjoy every time. I look at this and I'm like, this is one that matters to me.

The Zelda means something to me from back in the day. So, it's like I want it to be great. I really hope it will be. And again, this is a weird swerve, but stick with me. The way Nintendo is taking control of their own Destiny with the app, with the Mario movie, and having Miiamoto so involved, I have no reason not to believe they don't understand what they're doing here and they're going to get it. Do you agree? I absolutely agree. Now, that that might not mean it comes out perfect because Nintendo has released games where we were like, \"Ah, you missed the target a little bit.\" Yeah. But I, you know, like you said, they're not licensing it to another company with like slight oversight. Like, they're co-producing every one of their movies.

Interesting. Could just be it's going to be like Mario though where they celebrate all eras of Zelda. Yeah. And you know, the Zelda series itself has no real s solid canonical timeline because they just keep fussing with it. So I think like this movie could be its own story and as long as it contains a lot of the elements, it could still work really well. It's always that thing where like a new cookbook comes out and somehow that influences the Zelda timeline, like okay, I don't what why why is this thing being updated right now? Okay.

That's all I want to do. Ducker, I'm obsessed. But I'm obsessed from a distance, which is the worst kind of obsession.

Yeah, that all makes sense to me. That's That's I'm I'm I want to play Monster Hunter Wild, but I'm I'm holding off for now just because I have so many other things and I don't want to do something that I do every year, which is I buy a big AAA game and then buy another AAA game and then buy a third AAA game and beat the last one and never play the first two.
