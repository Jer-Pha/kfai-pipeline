I'm your host Tim Gettys and I am joined today by a very excited snow bike. Mike, Tim, I've been holding it back. I told you today, don't look at me. Don't look at me. Big things happened last night that I wanted to tell you about and you said, \"Mike, how about I just give you a podcast and you can tell me all about it.\" Every day for the last week or so, you've come into this office and uh no matter how busy I've been, stressed I've been, you bring a smile to my face because you are taking part on your first journey into Final Fantasy 10. One of the most beautiful love stories in video games. an amazing narrative about the intersection between religion and technology and what time can do to that and the relationships between people and how powerful love can be through time and you feeling it for the first time sacrifice I got a sacrifice dam dude it's too real and so the energy and",

It means a lot to many, many, many people out there. I would say that it is one of the jump on points of the franchise. It being the first PlayStation 2 uh entry, um the first one with voice acting, uh I think that it the timing of it coming out, there's a lot of people like me that played Pokemon, fell in love, and were like, \"What is this turnbased stuff? What is this RPG?\" Okay. And then Final Fantasy 10 kind of being that like, \"All right, cool. Let's play a little Let's do some big boy stuff, you know. And now, Mike, you're a big boy now.

This isn't a review. This is two best friends gathered around the water cooler telling stories, kind of recapping the plot, and just getting lost in the sauce that is Final Fantasy 10. I'll talk about the things that I like and I don't like, but like I just wanted to come to Tim and tell him about my journey so far. I am 24 hours in I from what I can tell you're about halfway through. It's been a long time since I played through the entirety of this game.

I thought I stopped the wedding once and you were like, \"Oh, did this happen?\" That didn't happen. Then I finally stopped the real wedding. We're going to talk about this wedding dress. Tim, that wedding dress that should be everywhere. Everybody wearing that wedding dress. That's how beautiful. You're looking good. Here's the thing, everyone.

That's sick. I love I remember I got it on uh I think it was Christmas when I first got it if I remember correctly. Um or maybe there if I didn't get it on Christmas. I uh had it and uh when I first started playing it, I loved it, but it was a little much for me. Like there was a lot. It was a little slow. I was like a little 10-year-old, you know what I mean?

Tim, we're going to jump all over the place and I'm going to get us to the beginning, but I just want to talk about what I saw last night. All right, cuz that's hot in my mind.

Yeah, it's not who you would expect either. Nouatsu, uh, who would the guy that you would expect if you if you knew Mike, uh, the the iconic Final Fantasy composer, only did a handful of songs for 10, uh, including Tuzan and Sutani, which are like the two big main ones. But, um, otherwise, uh, I always forget uh, his name. It starts with an M, but uh, I I'll have to look that up. But yeah, no, he pops pops off. And uh that scene, the wedding scene, I must have watched that 10,000 times when I was when I was a kid.

He played blitz ball in front of me once and that's the only reason why I knew what blitz ball was but I had never seen any cut scenes and I'll tell you what these cutscenes are baller these cutscenes [\u00a0__\u00a0] every time the game goes into out of gameplay in the cut scene you get up in your chair and then sometimes they'll tease you they'll go back to gameplay but then right back in the cut scene you're like what are you doing it's so good bro uh Mashi Hamau and Junior Nakano are the the two composers and yeah they pop off love the battle theme in this game So, we're battling through Tim.

I I want your thoughts on the battle system because again I was saying Final Fantasy 10 I think is a very good My first Final Fantasy for people that first RPGs was Pok\u00e9mon because it is turn-based and unlike the majority of Final Fantasies, it's not active turnbased. It is if you don't touch the controller, nothing happens, right? Yeah, you have the little like the turn chart in the upper right and you need to care about using things like haste or slow and all that way more than I ever have in a different in a Final Fantasy. I was slapping that dragon on top of the airship with slow and it felt so good to you see them slow down slow down then they move they lose the turn. Tim, I really like the battles.

The turn styles. What do you call that? Turn rotation. Team rotation. The call battle system or something like that. But just so you know, Mike, when I say active, like the the actual name of the battle system in like Final Fantasy 7 stuff is active time battle, which is you have that little bar that goes down and then you can attack. So it's like, you know what I'm talking about? No, I never looked at that. That's [\u00a0__\u00a0] crazy. Yeah. Well, you mainly the old funnel pass the original.

On the boat between Kilica and Luca, there's a ball on the boat. You learn the jet shot in a very crazy way. Yeah, weird little mini game thing. Crazy mini game. You also learn about uh Chapu a little bit and Lulu.

Okay. First half, of course. Why is Tetus not allowed? Or Tetus not Tetus is allowed in the game, but he doesn't use the jet shot until you equipped it in the second half. So I never get to use the jet shot. [\u00a0__\u00a0] They teased me. Yeah. They know I wanted it, right? Yeah. And so then that's like an exped or expedition game to just get you loosened up, get you ready. But at the same time, something going on, Tim, you hear it.

His father was drinking a lot at the time, wasn't the best dad to Tetus. Also might not have known how to have been a dad. He was struggling. He was having a lot of tough times, right?
