You know, the people ask for it, the people receive it. They want my redemption. I think we were we were talking and we both kind of came to the agreement that I wasn't wrong on anything and that the audience was wrong. I I don't know if I'd say we both. We both came to that and I I'm here to tell you guys I forgive you. We're going to move on and this is going to be a great day. You know what? Well said. I feel you. I don't know if I agree with everything, but I feel you. Of course, also joining us, we have Stella Chung for the first time representing Andy's Team Purple. Yeah, team baby girl.

I don't think it's a terrible answer, though, because like the recent Resident Evil 3 was, I think, a bit of a let down compared to Resident Evil 2 remake. Yeah.

Seventh place technically. Going back, uh we had one secret answer that I mentioned before. It was for our fourth round where I asked you to name two video game brothers. Uh the secret answer in our sixth place answer for that would have been Brock and Cindy from God of War. Some of my favorite brothers in video games. I think uh Cyny's performance in God of War Ragnarok is probably one of the greatest video game performances of all time. And it doesn't and it doesn't get enough love and whoop.
