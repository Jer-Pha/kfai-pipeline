We were arguing about the HDR. There will be HDR. The H the HDR was like a like mainly like a kind of a goof just cuz they, you know, Nintendo rarely gives a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about anything modern. But the OLED thing, you know, you sound like it's more of a if it happens, that's amazing for me, but I, you know, I'm not so sure. More than that, though. That is, that's obvious.

Just do more of what the Switch already did. I think they're in a unique position right now to put out the two SKs act more like everyone else is acting in this tech gaming space of putting out multiple versions of the things.

I'm not I'm no longer surprised when a game doesn't have HDR built into the menus because it feels like it's more and more of a of a common thing now.

I really I truly believe there there's no chance that there's they don't have HDR. Interesting. So, the Switch at launch only launched with one skew for 300. The Wii U launched with two SKs for 300 and 350, respectively. Do you know what the difference between those SKs were for the Wii U? It was storage space and the color. The Wii U was white or the nicer one was black. Black and the Switch or Switch One had the two SKs that were just gray and the color the gray or the color JoyCons.

If it's two SKs, I think you figure out a way to have one of those SKs be 350 by either getting storage down or figuring out something. But I feel like an OLED Switch or an OLED Switch 2, we're talking $500 like six. I feel like that's way too much. No, not I mean that's the thing. The OLED not that much more expensive.

So yeah, 100%. How many games would take advantage of that? True advantage of it. Exactly. Roger was uh claiming laziness. So just like a you just want to be on the couch and then you hit C and then you cast to the thing. But yeah, but that's just personal. I I think I think that the latency and all that stuff like that those problems are solved for the type of we're not playing Valerant. You know what I mean?
