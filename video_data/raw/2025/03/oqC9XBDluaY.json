This is Wesley Yinpool at IGN.com and the super chat question begins. Are you more excited for GTA 6 or Ghost of Yotay? Tell me why. Uh, back to Wesley. Uh, we haven't heard much about Ghost of Yotay in recent months, but after fans spotted a morsel of new story information published to the game's website, they're having fun speculating about how Sucker Punch's hotly anticipated PlayStation 5 exclusive will actually play. The official website includes the following story snippet. 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, a new warrior, Atsu, arises from the ashes of her homestead. Filled with fury and determination, Atsu will hunt down those responsible for the death of her family and exact her revenge. Every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives,",

But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the ghost will be up to you.\" End quote. We already knew Ghost of Yote is setting uh is and the time period and that Atsu will be on a revenge mission of some kind. But what we didn't know was that she's hunting down those responsible for the death of her family after her homestead is destroyed. Fans speculating that Ghost of Yotay will have bounty hunting mechanic in which Atsu takes on jobs to earn money needed for other things in the game. There's the potential here then for an actual in-game economy where Sushima didn't really have any sort of money mechanic. If true, this taps into Sucker Punch's stated goal of giving players more control over Atsu's story.

Uh, with that in mind, perhaps Ghost of Yote will release this summer. Blessing, Adoay Jr. Greg Miller, are you more excited for GTA 6 or Ghost of Yote? Who do you think would win in a battle between a hydrogen bomb and a coughing baby? GTA 6. But also like I don't know, it's a tough thing where I'm excited for all these games, right?

We got Metal Gear Solid Delta coming out in August. We got Hell's Us coming out later in the year, right? We got Borderlands 4. Like there's so many game excited for Borderlands 4.

Yeah, exactly right. And I think right now is one of those times where I can kind of look around a little bit and be like, \"All right, what do I want to play?\" And I think right now for a AAA game that is going to be about people putting time into it and it being that game that is, all right, I got I got nothing else to play. Let me put on some Borderlands 4 and just shoot [\u00a0__\u00a0] right?

I think it coming out in the fall, I'm a little bit like, all right, like it's it's crowded. It's Borderlands and Borderlands has the the IP power and the name recognition and all all that stuff. But if it comes out alongside whatever Nintendo and whatever like Ghost of Yote and whatever like these big companies have going on, they're not going to release it alongside GTA 6. This is an interesting even keeping Borderlands in the conversation. For me, I'm saying right away like for me to get hype about Borderlands 4, I'm going to need a Vault Hunter I really like.

That was great. What I'm saying though and where I'm going with this conversation is I think I'm more excited for Ghost of Yotay than I am GTA 6. Not because I don't love GTA, not because I'm not excited for GTA 6, just because they're giving me something. I understand what the game of Yot is going to be. Obviously, I love Erica Isishi.

But until I'm really seeing what that game is and what my moment to moment gameplay is going to be, it's like, okay, well, I've done GTA a lot. This episode's brought to you by Lost Skies.

I think right now in the marketing cycle for both these games, Ghost of Yote, I think just feels more tangible and feasible and we're getting bits about it, right, that I think is important.

And I think both those games are great examples. I think Ghost of Tsushima already, even with within its repetition, was already still fun. I liked the things that I was doing. So, if it is the thing of all right, we're taking what worked with Ghost of Sushima and just building in more excitement from the moment to moment, finding the next I was going to say tower.

It's the big most important thing in my life, but I'm also going to go sink this tower and I'm also going to go find this guy's cat and I'm also like there's that juxosition for it, right?
