Uh, however, despite this heady success, Lyen is moving on from Balders's Gate and has confirmed two games are currently in the works, both of which will be based on his own IPs and described as the studio's best work ever. So, where does that leave the future of Balders's Gate? Well, there are plenty of others who are very interested in Balders's Gate. SVP of digital games at HasRO Dan Aub has said, quote, \"We're kind of working out what our plans are for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that, IU told IGN during this week's GDC event in San Francisco.

We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about it. Okay. Yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. Aub explained with the publication adding that exec uh the adding the exec said he eventually wants a Baldersgate 4, but it'll take some time. As for other Hasbro Dungeons and Dragons games, I said he is quote never one to shy down from a challenge. After all, there are several other D and D based games in the works.

Man, we can name these studios, but like I don't know. I don't know if any of them are going to make a Boulders Gate that's as good as Boulders Skate 3. Yeah. So then it's like, do you redefine what it is a little bit? Cuz then if you do want to go CD Project Red, which I don't think is the right choice honestly, but if you do want to go with them, it's going to be a different type of game. Balders's Gate 3, if you're going to make an actual proper Balders Gate 4, you got to wait like 15 years.

Let's make Balders Grade 4. You're just not going to get to that point for a very long time. You're going to have to wait. I think you either wait or you have to take it in like a dynamically different direction that is going to make people either not love it as much or might really resonate with people. My booking for this and this is going to piss people off Super Giant.
