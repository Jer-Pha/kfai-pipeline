Hi, how are you? Good. I'm feeling great. This is an exciting one. This is exciting. We've been meaning to do this one for a while. So, I'm very excited about this. Ever since we hired Roger, he said, \"Get me Remedy. I want to talk to Remedy. I want to have a whole bunch of different conversations with Remedy.\" And I said, \"I can do that.\" And it only took me 5 years. Here we are with creative directors Sam and Male. Hello, Remedy. Hello. Hello. How are you? Very good. I have plenty of coffee. Yeah, I'm I'm good. I'm good. The first question I saw go through in the live chat, Sam, was how do you take your coffee? Black.

Uh it uh a lot of work goes into it, but it's it it it comes from the people and and it it it it comes from us sharing certain kind of things that we get excited about and and and want to do and and I feel that we've been lucky in the sense that that we have found other people who also share this kind of a feeling.

How does that work at the studio? Like are you both equally you know hands-on on all the projects? Is it divvying up of things? Are are you learning how to do that right now? Like how does that work? We we are learning. I mean with with Mixu we have worked together since 2001. Yeah. So so forever. A while. Yeah. Yeah.

So, so let alone then kind of somehow overseeing and and being a consultant to every project and and and all of this now with with Anna pictures looking into linear media as well. There is just so much work that that this way the likelihood of us surviving the work is is better odds. Yeah. Better odds. But also like how do you stop yourself both of you from not putting everything or putting everything into these games and these projects but not you know having it take from you too much right because I can imagine you you've talked Sam a lot about how Allen Way 2 was it's your baby it's something you wanted",

Uh is there a line? Is there a way that you guys are able to lean on each other, lean on the team? How do you how do you guys Oh, sure. And and we divided it up very consciously. Uh after the first control, the idea was that I'll focus now on Alan Wake 2 and and Mix will focus on on what's next for control. Yeah. Uh which is Sorry, man. FPC. Oh, yeah. That's right. That's right. I guess one thing I want to add to that is that Yeah. Yeah, it's not self-evident that like maintaining that sense of identity uh",

So our kind of shared love towards certain kind of a uh expressions in pop culture and so on has been like a core foundation to many of the things that we're doing. And I think along the journey um I think we kind of start to put more like you start to see like Finnish culture as well like when you kind of say control for instance and so on. So I think we kind of Yes. pouring more of that stuff into it as well, which has been great. Uh, but one thing that I think is cool about also uh going from one project at a time into a multi- project studio is that um I think it also allows the different franchise that we have to be like what they need to be and on wake 2 can be purely a survival horror like go all the way you know uh and amplify a little bit of dancing.

So, so I I think it's good and and us two kind of overseeing we have our own inclinations obviously, but there's that kind of a shared love towards like this kind of a heart of what remedy is that I think propagates into everything that we do. Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. That's actually something I was going to ask, right? Is that now that we're going deeper and deeper into the RCU, right?

It is not a single player video game. is a three player co-op uh pick up and play experience. Uh is that something that we're looking towards in the future for more of these things or is this just a little test here? How important is it to have these smaller experiences here? Um one starting point that we had for Firebreak was that um we wanted to find a human perspective into this world as well. Like Chessie for instance is is a person of power and Alan Wake obviously has powers as well and so on. So it's interesting to see like people who actually don't have any supernatural powers at all.

Uh and but I never played Alan Wake before, right? And my fiance never played any remedy game, right? So, uh, we booted up Alan Lake 2, and you guys assured me that I can play Alen Lake 2 without playing Alan Lake 1. I know it probably hurts your soul a little bit, but, you know, I wanted to try I wanted to try it out. Uh, and my fiance is the biggest remedy head now.

So so it's really really important that each of them are approachable on their own but then if you like it and and and get interested then you can go and and catch up with the history.

I feel like it's very easy to be like oh we're going to make just a bunch of sequels and you have to read them all beforehand in order to get into it. you are also doing it in video games, right? Crazy in and of itself. Like that's that's nuts and it's exciting. Uh but now you are creating on-ramps for people into these things and you're also making side games that are potentially or not potentially they are adding on to the lore, right?

You don't need to dig into everything, read every single kind of a note that you find and so on. It's fine.

I I do think it's important that people see that side, but then but I feel like when we talk about it, of course, we want to talk about well because that's what we're excited about and and making sure that people get that there are these different layers of experience that you can have within these games. Yeah. You want to go to the chat? Yeah, let's go. We got a bunch of people super chatting of course on youtube.comkindfunname where you could ask your questions of Sam McKelen Remedy in general.

I'm going to start with CJ Splitzon who writes in and says, \"Does working with multiple publishers affect how you design each game?\" Again, kind of funny games daily hat on. We talk about the industry at large all the time, right? how hard it is to be an independent video game developer. I think people look past you guys a lot, right? Because you're making games like Allen Wake 2 that are have all the appearances of AAA. You're a smaller team, so maybe you define it as double A. But in the grand scheme of things, you're an independent developer trying to make this work, right? And you guys have always been very vocal and very honest about, hey, we're doing this project.

Um, for sure. uh every relationship is different. Sure. Uh and and publishers role is hugely important. Uh getting a game done. We I I feel that we we have learned a lot along the way. I I I feel we've been very lucky with the recent games like 505 games with Control, Epic Publishing, with with Alan Wake 2. Both of them showed a ton of trust towards us and and and allowed us to kind of like take our vision and and create the game and and support it us where where where needed.

Yeah. at the at the end of the day, I I think we built up a lot of confidence also into the things that we believe in, right? So, and and I think if there's something that really invested in and believe that this is the right way to go, um I I think we always do everything we can to really kind of get it into the game. Uh and honestly, I I don't think it has happened that often that there's been any kind of a kind of a collisions on on that front.

Uh your use of meta commentary and themes is unmatched in the gaming space. How do you all balance gameplay, artistic expression, story, etc. In which element do you find draws your focus the most? Just a little question. No big there there is it it it goes to experience like having done multiple games, tried out things, seen the things that don't work, seen the things that do work. Sure.

I've always been like I started out as a writer and and I I I very firmly think of myself as a storyteller more than designer of of the game side. Sure. And and and that's why in these projects I always want to partner up with the game director. Kyle Rowley, the game director of Alan Wake 2 is he comes from the design perspective. I come from storytelling perspective and then together we kind of like figure it out and and and form the experience. So there are different roles as well like if if somebody is focusing more on something then we'll just find a partner to kind of support the other areas.

Um it is extremely difficult sometimes to kind of find balance in that um so that the experience has become too passive and um and kind of finding the interactivity in it. Uh but we have a lot of like when when you think about like let's say the Astro Maze sequencing control it's like combining music and action and gameplay and movement and kind of telling a story at the same time through the lyrics you know of the song and so on and and those are things that I personally",

It's always teamwork like finding really really talented people that you can rely on and who bring their own expertise into the mix when you're building up to something like the Ashtray maze in control. Like is it exciting? Is it terrifying? Is it all of because it's like you know what that could be. You know what it needs to be but I assume at some point making that you're like this is really tough and what if it doesn't hit? Is that in the around there male?

Then there's the team itself. There's a VFX department looking at how all the kind of visuals work with the when the environment like shifts around you. Uh so there's so so many kind of different things that have to come together and all you can do is in the beginning try to kind of portray a vision of what you want to achieve and then let the pieces kind of land and put them together in a kind of a cohesive way and you never quite know exactly how it's going to go down.",

And uh regards to control too. Yeah. Talk in in detail about right now. Yeah. Well, I I guess the only thing I want to say is like I mean in the same way as an is in many ways Sam's baby, control is mine. And I feel like control can be also so much more than than what you saw in the first game. And uh and I'm super excited about the sequel. It's going to be wild and bonkers, but that's all I can say. Hello Jannina Gavanchar. How are you? You're live on Twitch and YouTube. Greg. Greggy, what are you doing right now? I'm talking to Sam Male. Like you could you could turn on I'm aware.

We couldn't make it happen the way that we wanted to.\" And it's it's when you look at this video, right? First of all, what were you thinking in that moment? What was the what was the feelings?

Uh and and and that was one like it it was a huge disappointment back then like like I mean we built the how it went was we were just kids when we made Max Bane and there was not a single thought given to the idea of a potential sequel while we were working on Max Bane only afterwards it was like oh we we we're going to make a sequel I wish I hadn't killed all the characters in the story.

Uh so so that was you know okay I thought I knew how this is going to go this is not at all how it's going to go and and always things work out have worked out through the years for us we've been lucky as well and and and the conversations with Microsoft from Alan Wake 2 spinned into something new which was quantum break that I'm also very proud of.

He was going through it. He needed to hug. If only you could show him the video of you dancing at the Game Award. Yes. And and and that's that's one other learning on on this journey uh through 30 years is that I'm so happy we didn't create that Alan Wake 2 or the next one or the next one, but but rather this one because huge part of what Alan Wake 2 now is would not have been possible before like all the learnings that were poured into like all the learnings from control as well.

So, I have a few super chats I want to throw at you from YouTube.com/kindfunnygames.

Yeah. Well, Lynch is and always has been a huge inspiration for me. Yeah. uh like like and and new weird uh that that control very much was tapping into as a as a as an inspiration of a genre in in literature certainly has a lot of elements that is kind of like the fluidity of uh identity and and and and so so it is at the core of it. I absolutely love metal layer stuff. noticed. Uh, some might say too much, but there you go. Um, yeah, I I it's interesting. I I I think it's an interesting aspect in the storytelling. And once again, maybe looking at it from a totally different perspective is uh absolutely loving the really talented actors. uh we've we've grown a relationship with and and been working for a long time and and like I always want to bring in these trusted partners back.

Yeah. So, as an as a concrete example, Ilavi and and Matthew Poreda combined being Alan Wake. Uh but I I' I've been thinking about this idea that I want both of them an opportunity to shine purely on their own and and and let me figure out a perfect role and and that in partly because of the story but partly because of this opportunity led to Dr. Darling and and and now the latest incarnation of of Thomas Sain in in Alan Wake 2.

Um, well, we did a collaboration with Kohima. Uh, yeah, love him. Uh, would love to do something again. Uh I mean it's it's an interesting question. I like there there are more collabs uh in Alan Wake 2 than ever before like like all the like beyond poets of the fall as old gods of Ascard but but broadening that to like 20 plus talented musicians coming in with different custommade songs. uh and and that I felt was a huge success and and worked so well and it was such a pleasure all through the way uh working with with",
