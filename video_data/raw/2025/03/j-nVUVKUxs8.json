Aliens versus Predator 2. That's not what they called this movie. That's not How do you feel about the curting and like just overall spacing of this? Look at that two. Ah, it's so annoying. That's a Destiny 2. Like that's that's a Destiny 2 font. Oh my lord. Uh we've been on a amazing journey here uh with the Alien and Predator movies the last couple weeks.

The goal is for us to just continue through to the end for this franchise. Uh, originally we were going to like jump off and take some gaps and whatever, but it seems like things have worked out that, uh, we will just continue on the next couple weeks, uh, which is very exciting. So, how many I don't how many movies are there in this? I I'm just We're This is a rarity.

Lights are expensive, but they didn't buy any for this one. You're just recording a dark room. Not a whole lot of rendering. I want to actually read a little bit from the directors uh saying like on on paper, Alien versus Predator Reco sounds like a fun, interesting movie. You know, take these guys, put them on Earth. It's going to be a good time. Um but there's a a reason that people didn't like this movie so much. It was dark. They couldn't see what the hell was going on.

If people haven't seen this movie, it's very very very very dark. That might be one of the the first things you hear when people bring up this movie. It's like it was dark, right? Um so apparently this was a choice. Um they're like, \"Hey, we have a small budget, so we need to work with that budget and we can't let people see that they're just guys in suits fighting because they're just guys in suits fighting.\" And so it was a choice by them. They're like, um, one of the first things in our pitch, we said, \"The movie's got to take place and power's got to get knocked out and it's got to be raining the whole night. uh seeing an alien broad daylight or just plain view is going to look stupid no matter what you do. The reason it worked in all the other movies is you were in a dark spaceship. You add flashing blinking lights, steam jets, you had all these great elements to",

You add flashing blinking lights, steam jets, you had all these great elements to cover them up, basically. And if you don't do that, they're going to look like guys in suits. On one hand, this logic makes a lot of sense. Uh but while the movie was always intended to look dark, the Strauss brothers ended up teetering too far in the wrong direction, leaving a muddled mess in their wake. Audiences weren't the only ones frustrated by that approach. Even some of the crew members were annoyed with not being able to see enough on set. As seen in the behind the scenes clip from the movie that circulated in 2016, the cinematographer Daniel Pearl was seen getting frustrated trying to shoot a scene because he couldn't get it bright enough. Uh, one of the trickier things too was when you got things like all the geeky fans who know everything about the movie, they go, \"Oh, I know",

I know that's the pre alien.\" The biggest issue we had with the design is because we're going so dark with the movie and there's a lot of rain and atmosphere and everything. Is a normal person watching the movie going to be able to tell the difference? I'm gonna stop reading there. The answer is no. Yeah. I just want to start off real quick. I was so hyped last week when we end with the Pred Alien and I'm like, are we gonna get this [\u00a0__\u00a0] Pred Alien? And when this movie starts off with that, I was I I was like I literally was like audly, holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] they're doing it. I did not think we were doing this for sure. Yeah.

He runs with a dumb alien that he just pushes out of the way. Dude, this the editing of this movie was atrocious. There was some scenes where you had like 20 camera cuts in a 4se secondond span. It was real real bad [\u00a0__\u00a0] It was very very hard to understand what is going on at any given moment. I mean, that's like indie film book 101, right? It's like everything's shot. I think I read another piece of trivia that DP was like, you know, Alien versus Predator was shot very wide. Um, it was shot, you know, you you can see the the the aliens and the predators fighting on on a wider scale and we just didn't have the budget for that. So, they shot everything handheld.

They shot it close up and they obviously try to make it dark. But, I do want to point out that there's a difference between making an image look dark and making it look too contrasty. And so, that's what I actually responded to where you can't see any details anywhere in the shadows. And so, like that's what to me drew me out of the out of the movie cuz you can shoot a movie dark. You can have a movie where it's like, you know, the skin tones are, you know, 15 or whatever, but there's a way to light for that so that you can still have some tension, but see what the heck's going on. But there's like literally a sequence where he and the brother Dallas and the and the kid from who I think is Cam Giggit from Never Back Down, but it's not him.

It just really really takes you out of the movie, dude. the scenes that weren't in darkness where the movie starts off with uh like I I audibly told myself like this is one of the ugliest movies I've ever seen where it's all crushed. I think when the first guy, you know, gets off the room was like, \"What did you say?\" When he walks over to the to the police car, whatever, he's like, \"Get in the car, whatever.\" Like it I was like, \"It looks green screen, but I but it's not.

This feels like if you just take a video game and turn it into a movie. And I don't mean that in a positive way. Like there's so many connections to plot beats from Resident Evil, including them nuking the freaking town at the end, which is an insane call for them to make. Um, but I don't hate this movie.

This is like definitely a lot more violent and this is definitely got to be rated R. But that's kind of really all I got from it. This movie's cast in the worst way possible reminded me so much of a Saw movie later on. Like when Saw 3D mainly. Mhm.

They'd be on the outskirts of the town if they wanted everyone to go there cuz like that puts you in the middle. That would that that would have worked, I think, a lot better. Killer setup. Like that's a great plot there. Cool plot. We've seen it multiple times. We saw it in the mist where they're like, \"Do we leave the store? Do we not leave the store? We don't know. It's it's all for nothing.\" Yeah. Yeah. Uh, it's a Sophie's choice basically, right? So, they they fundamentally fumbled the football with that one. Uh, second, if you're doing",

And it totally dis I'm like, to Greg's point, how the [\u00a0__\u00a0] do the aliens get from point A to point B? We're supposed to think there's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ton of them now to the point where we have to nuke.

Yeah, he's all over the place. So, so I think that, you know, when you've got a town like um that's happening in like Halloween, right? The threat Hatenfield. Hatenfield, right?

So, I think they could have they could have done something a little bit more there. Maybe saving a little budget by shooting it someplace smaller. But overall, I I do the thing I like about it is the main alien who Chris Anka actually uh sent me a text and he was saying, \"Hey, the the the crew called it the wolf and they based it off of Harvey Kitel's character from Pulp Fiction, which I don't think you've seen yet, Tim, but he's a cleaner basically comes in as a clean.\" I'm like, \"That's a fun concept.\" Um, could we have given him more creative",

Also an awesome favorite moment where Yeah, exactly. But like Jen looked up for refresh like why is he dissolving things and I paused it and I'm like well there's two schools of thoughts and I did not remember at all this conversation that it's been confirmed AP is not part of the universe. Was it designed when they were making them that it wasn't it was it own? Well, I mean it just doesn't add up at all. It does totally. As I explained to her, I'm like, number one, we need to believe that when in 500 years or whatever it is for Ripley, aliens have never been here. So, there can be no evidence of that.

I wanted it to be the military lady and then but then you have her kid too who's just kind of there not really scared the whole time. I don't know. It's kind of a mess. Mommy, are the monsters gone?
