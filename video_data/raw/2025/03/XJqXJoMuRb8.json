The first review comes from Game Informer, who gave this game an 8.3 out of 10 and says, \"If your interest lies solely with the single player experience, and let's be frank, this is why we counted down the days until this game's release. I walked away from it pleased, but also unfulfilled. This game eventually becomes the sequel I hope for, but spends too much time getting there.\" Greg Miller, Uncharted 3. That is incorrect. If Andy or Tim don't have a guess, I'll move on to the second blur. Tim's thinking about it. He's thinking about it. He's thinking, you're solid, too. Nope. Andy's not buzzing in.

Let's move on to round number two. This first one comes from The Verge, uh, who didn't give this game a score, but did say, \"Despite being a largely linear game, this game gives you a surprising amount of freedom for how you want to approach things.

It is Andy Cortez for team purple with 100 points. And our winner this week, he is Mr. Stars in the bank. It is one Greg Miller with team blue with 120 points. I think on this win, Jen might give me the triple digit tonight. You know what I mean? I don't I'll bend over and she'll hit my prostate with",

Baby, your breath smells good. I've been eating ass all day. Greg, you win the star trophy. Thank you. I'm excited for that. Do I get a tip of the hat for the prostate? No, he's not. He's not. You're going to get a tip of something apparently, but not a bad not a bad. Of course, that then brings us to our star standings to catch up on our overall score for the season. Coming into this episode, Greg with team blue had two stars. He just earned his third star for the season. Team purple. Team purple sitting give me three of Tims right now. I'm going put an asterisk next to my six and Tim's three. That's what's happening. April 2nd. Uh, team purple sitting at one star. Shout out. Thank you, Raj.",

Come on, dude. Um, if Greg steals Tim's star with s in apostroph in um in a parenthesis cuz apparently I got to figure [\u00a0__\u00a0] out. Um, that's still could mean big changes for the season, but you have to tune in, continue to tune in throughout the season to see how that develops. Uh, contestants, thank you so much for joining me here on Game Showdown. Remember, Greg has called a shot. Apparently, he is redeeming this in the bank. He's cashing it in next week, the Nintendo Switch 2 direct. So, you're going to want to tune in for that. Of course, this has been Game Showdown, your nerdy trivia. Funny bless cuz I get to embarrass Tim",

She'll be here for the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event. Probably a whole bunch of new viewers, too. And I get to see what a charlatan this man is. [Music] Uh, fun update for you. Uh, I believe we don't have an episode next week or the week after if I'm thinking about this correctly. Uh, so, uh, be aware of that. Of course, tune into the Nintendo Direct apparently for game showdowns shenanigans. I mean, after we after I win the stars, we can just stop the show if you want. No more Game Showdown. I win.
