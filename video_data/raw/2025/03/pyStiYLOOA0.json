His production quality is is awesome. Off the charts. Uh so you did an awesome interview and you said something which uh you know I wanted to bring back here is uh you said when you're talking about uh remedy and what you always want to do, you said uh you're always trying to do something that has never been done before. Is that a lot of pressure? Because basically you are trying to top yourself at this point, right? Like talking about the control sequence, talking about the Allen Way 2 sequence, talking about the games that you continue to make. Is it just now? Are you just looking within yourselves now or like how do we top the last game? I is there any other way to do this is my question. True. But like if if if that's not the ambition then then what is? Yeah. Uh so for sure uh I I think that games in some ways just fit this idea",

It's just evolving constantly anyway. Uh so so I I think that the whole point is well let's figure out on the side of the game and storytelling and all where can we take this? It's always like like I I feel personally that that we've been like like tracing it back. It's it's a very logical true line uh through these experiences. Uh but at the same time we are always kind of questioning the individual parts and and does is this working? Maybe it isn't. Let's leave this behind. Let's bring in something new. Mhm.

Like you need to, you know, drive a lot of things and and be an inspiration and you know, work a lot different people and so on. And I think you kind of draw strength from something unique that you're doing, something that you're super excited about. And uh I I think it's just crucial to have something like that. And unfortunately, it seems to go like once you've done a thing, you're not necessarily super excited doing it again, right? Like you want to find something new. And that's that's like what fuels you really at the end of the day to be able to kind of push through all of the stuff that you need to do. But there's never a moment where you look back and you're like, man, we [\u00a0__\u00a0] killed that. You know what I mean?

It it it's it's a strange kind of schizophrenic feeling of you are kind of never satisfied at the end of the project because you are only seeing everything that was left behind along the way or like oh I wish that detail would be right. Then the realization that you have to go through every time again is that majority of it nobody playing it will notice in in in any way. But you are very kind of like close to it too close when you guys were here for Alenway 2. That was that was the feeling I felt from you guys of like oh how does this feel? We're like this is great.

I'm getting there. Enough time has passed now. Not to be annoyed by those details. 20 years or so. So, uh, uh, talking about Alen 2, uh, it clearly your biggest development undertaking.

Uh so so that was you know okay I thought I knew how this is going to go this is not at all how it's going to go and and always things work out have worked out through the years for us we've been lucky as well and and and the conversations with Microsoft from Alan Wake 2 spinned into something new which was quantum break that I'm also very proud of. Yeah. Uh but it felt like well now is time to you know face the fans and camera and explain like we really wanted this it's not happening and and and and sorry.
