I'm not on that games. So, I want to shout out two games. I saw Day Day of the Devs. Uh, this first game is Far Away, uh, which is an Annaperna published joint. This might be your [\u00a0__\u00a0] The idea behind it is that you play as just a ship and it's it's just like a 2D game. You're going as a ship. You There's no left or right.

So, it's this very simple game where you're going around and you're trying to connect constellations. Spaceship. Spaceship. I was thinking you just said ship. So, I was thinking pirates. I thought we were in the ocean. So, when you started saying the stars, I was like, \"Huh, this is interesting.\" But no, now I see I see the vision. Yeah. So, you're going around and you're using it to kind of like use the momentum to go through and go around and uh create constellations. So that was a really nice time. That was a really nice time. That's I think that's that's going to be your joint. It's like it feels like a you know an afternoon. You play the game, you have enough time with it and you're kind of done with it.

Is it like a is it a weird Are you playing as a weird guy? As a weird guy. Sort of. You're shooting weird guys. So it is Do you know the director Harmony Krin? No. You you've spring breakers. The director of Spring Breakers. Yes. So, uh, weird director making weird movies. Now he's making weird games. Uh, and his first game is called, uh, Tamashika. Uh, and just if you could show up. Yeah. People that are watching this, if you are sensitive to flashing lights, turn off right now because it's insane. I kept seeing this game. Yes.

Uh and the whole idea behind it is that it is almost semi- rhythm based, right? So it's like to the beats, you're shooting these guys, they come at you and you can counter them with a knife. Uh and then one one or two hits, I believe, you're dead. Uh the interesting wrinkle to this is that every day the level is redesigned. So there is a leaderboard and then after that day it resets and it's a new level. Uh so you're constantly going in and trying to get the the new high score.

Uh so yeah, Harmony Karin's company is uh publishing this and their company's name Edge Lord which I hate. But uh Oh, the person who founded the company Edge Lord also made Spring Breakers. Yeah, it's crazy. Makes sense. Yeah, makes sense. So yeah, shout shout out to those two games. I love that. Thank you so much for sharing that with us.

Uh continued, you can see a Game Informer magazine in the back there and a Metroid, which makes it more exciting, right?

It feels like yeah it's been maybe almost a year kind of chat let us know when when did game informer first go down. Yeah I I don't think they see any value in this. I I think they they are after this happened, they moved on and then potentially people at uh that were that left that were previously at Game Informer came together, went to GameStop and said, \"You're not doing anything with this. You guys need money. Is there any way that we can figure out a solution here? Is there any way that we can get that IP back? Can we license it out?\" Whatever that looks like. And then Game GameStop is like, \"Yeah, whatever. Here you go.\" People are saying August uh 2024 is when it went down, which is more recent than I would have thought.
