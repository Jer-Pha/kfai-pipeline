We just need another pandemic to happen for you to get a cheap guitar. This time I'm going to buy one that's like a fulls size guitar. Not the mistake I made was buying the keyboard was too small. It didn't fit in my hand. You would have been a master pianist now if uh you didn't get the small piano. Right. I I want you to refer to me as the master. Okay. Everybody. Hey, what's up?

I played a little bit at launch and I'm now coming back because of the show, but that's a different story. Uh, my huge super fan. Uh, my argument was that this is me doing what I love the most about our job and talking to developers about their video game. But beyond the normal of that, beyond it is the idea that this is the deepest dive ever. This is a 10-year journey across four episodes. It's Matt talk and Rich talking, you know, in great detail without shying away from the problems that happened, the mistakes that were made.

That's a fascinating story whether you care or not about the O scrolls online. It's not about the minutiae of what's happening with the story. It's about how they made a game. I thought episode one was so great about like them working on a game and then guess what? Skyrim happens and they're like, \"We have to change the entire game now because of that.\" And then here we are of how you change it.

Let's get into The Last of Us season 2, episode two, Through the Valley, directed by Mark Milad, who is uh known for directing some of the more emotionally heavy Game of Thrones episodes um and 16 episodes of Succession. He was uh very key to that show um and and most of its if not all of its big episodes and big moments. So, really cool seeing him pop up in the end of this in the little uh behind the scenes things. I'm like, I've seen every single one of these succession ones and anytime he talks about like you're a smart guy, you get some [\u00a0__\u00a0] Um, but yeah, through the valley.

I mean, this for anyone who is a fan of the game, this is the episode, right? This is like the the big moment. And I was watching it with my wife yesterday and she was like, \"I'm getting a little tired.\" I'm like, \"You need to finish this episode before you read anything about it.\" And granted, it came out Sunday, but I'm like, \"I don't want someone to spo randomly inadvertently say something about this because this is in this is the main crux of what this whole series is going to forward is going to be about, right?

And so I was very much looking forward to to seeing her sort of experience that and it was I think very very well done. I think the the town fight really added a lot to it. I think it added a lot to like the suspense of what was going on. I think Tommy, the actor that plays him, is doing a great job. It's great seeing by the way Luna, right? Is that what his name is? Yeah, he's uh he's he's rad. Great seeing uh uh the actor from True Blood coming back to play the sort of mayor of the town. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maria. Yeah. Yeah. But of course, we know her better as Don't Tell Me, don't tell me. Oh god, I saw Tara. She was when season one when she popped up. Yeah. I was like, \"Oh my god, that's Tara from True Blood.\" Yeah.

And obviously this is a lot of setup for for where we we we end this. What's interesting is watching somebody who who didn't know it was coming and and watching D just kind of sit with that being like, \"Wow, this is this is a lot darker than I thought it's going to be.\" And I I'm conflicted. The show is great. They do it very It's very very faithful, but I do remember playing the game and being like, I don't know how much more of this experience that I want because it's really really really violent and really really really dark.

So that's what I'm excited for for week three. Yeah, Greg. Fantastic. Um, you know, they made some subtle changes here, some differences with the parties. Uh, obviously everything going on at Jackson. Like I love this episode, uh, Stem to Stern. I think as that confrontation with Joel and obviously his inevitable death here. I stick with I love this. I liked the games more. There's something about it with me in the game.

Like I and I'm not that doesn't take away from this at all, but like when you're sitting there and like you know I'm so I' I'm the [\u00a0__\u00a0] who quotes the show right before it happens. So when things weren't happening the way that I was like, \"Okay, cool. You're keeping me guessing.\" And I like, and I again think this works so well for the Abby and the WLF group we're making here, you it all works fine, but I miss that. But to get Abby with the you don't get to rush this, right? And get to see the I think this show with them being real people is portraying better that horror of her group watching her do this, right? just whail on him and try to in the like stop end this now, right?

So, it's interesting to still see it hit for different reasons, right? Like something like when Bella Ramsey is on the ground as Ellie screaming, you know, get up Joel, get like that's so just from the game, but like Ellie in the game I felt was more crying, more broken by it, right? where she's still in this. But when Bella Ramsay as Ellie crawls to him and puts her face on his face, that I'm tearing up right now because that is such a Ben thing to do for me right now. Or or mom, too. I do it too. I know you do cuz I love you, baby. Betty. Anyways, but like to have that touchstone there and be like, \"Wow.\" And you know, like I",

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like it was really incredibly powerful. You know, I immediately took to Blue Sky afterwards to uh compliment Caitlyn de like her Abby and the monologue she gets and I was I kept waiting for the Joel from the game moment of like quit with your your monologue or whatever. Just get this over with. You know, you eventually got to just get on with it. And it's like not the same. She doesn't have a monologue in the game. Yeah. Exactly. It's not the same.

I I would say and I want to get to Tim's overall thoughts on it too though. I would I would it's interesting because we don't spend a lot of time with Abby before this moment. And correct me if I'm wrong, but in the game the game kicks off with you like there's moments where you play as her as she's training in the other camp leading up to that, isn't it? No, that's after. That's after. Okay. In the game, Abby just shows up and basically kills Joel and you're like, \"Why the fuck?\" And then right here is where it cuts to her. No. Damn. When do you get to Abby? Well, you play as Abby a little bit,",

It's just not the zombie horde thing, but it's like you are you do play as her for a very brief moment. I'm I'm misremembering that cuz I remember there being like training and you're back at the Firefly. That's later. Yeah. Okay. Um I I loved this episode so much and I I I love that there even is discourse of like which is better and like what are the differences and all that. I I feel like that's the power of this. Like this is such an important moment and like Nick was saying is the crux of this season and in a lot of ways the overall last of a story and Ellie's entire journey. It's like yes, it is Joel's death that is one of the biggest moments like one of the most important moments in the uh not just",

It's like yes, it is Joel's death that is one of the biggest moments like one of the most important moments in the uh not just these stories but like we look at the game of thrones or we look at succession like there are the the core moments in these stories that change everything and there's no going back from right and uh in this there is no going back from from Joel dying and what that means to Ellie and the characters around her. I personally, as a huge fan of the games and as somebody that loves Last of Us 2, uh, and the story of Last of Us 2, I am so impressed by how they've adapted it, but also kept me on my toes and kept me interested. And when they make a change, more often than not, I'm I like it. Even if I don't think it's better, I just like the direction that it's going. Like, having Dena with them instead of Tommy is different. And I immediately initially didn't like it where I was like, \"Oh man,",

But I think that having Tommy not at the the actual death, having him back defending Jackson makes Jackson so much more important. And I feel like it raises the stakes of how important Joel and Tommy are to this amount of people. I feel like in the games you get the vibe. Okay, cool. There's a little set settlement here. It's like they are on the path to fixing the problem of of humanity. Like they they have a thing going like they're the the apocalypse happened and they are they're the beginning of a new future that like you could see new generations living in in Jackson.

And the way the frozen clicker turns and like you're like, \"Oh, it's a live.\" Oh, no, it's not. It's actually and it's just like whirlpool of all the infected coming up and from that moment that it just like all of a sudden the tension for the rest of the episode's going. I know what's going to happen. But like getting all this other Jackson stuff, like the way that the zombies were running into the walls, like it was freaking terrifying and actually scary and um the way that it felt. So I love the adapting the feel of a video game into these shows because again, it's an adaptation of a game even for a bunch of new stuff that we never got.",

I love the barrels going down and them shooting them to make him explode. I'm like the siege war and that's that's so cool. But it has the prestige video production of an HBO show. And I think that having Tommy the moment of Tommy and Maria at the end like hugging after so much death and destruction happened in Jackson. Like to me all that stuff I think it is going even further to when I mean I assume Tommy goes out to avenge Joel. It gives us even more of what he's leaving behind. And like he is their sole defender. When other when the other fire guys backed out when they saw the evil coming towards them, he stood there with the",

There was someone someone in the live chat as we're recording this was asking if if the the scale of the assault on the town took away from the moment with Joel. And I don't I would actually argue the opposite. I think because the stakes were so high there. There was a part of me that was like if I hadn't watched this, I'd be like, \"Oh, for sure Ellie's going to come in and save him in this.\" Right?

Yeah, I I'm with Greg that I think that the game overall did that moment just a little bit better. But again, this being different, I I I almost don't even want to compare it. Just I don't think it was better enough or different enough that it really matters. I think that they nailed what they were going for. I was so emotionally stressed out watching this and watching it with Gia who did not know was one of the most like gut-wrenching things I've experienced with her.

And again, I think it's I think it's it's such a good bit of storytelling where you look at this and you guys are bringing in the the Game of Thrones analog and I think it's so well done because Game of Thrones the thing it did great was it took a group of people that were bad and then slowly but surely over the course of good storytelling and good acting, it made you care about them.

And we keep seeing her, she did the MMA training and then she's like doing the punching bag stuff and the next time on. I'm like, I like that. Sure, Caitlyn's not the physical force that we know from the games with Abby, but I I like that that is kind of being flipped on its head a little bit between um the two groups.

Um, so I like that, but this week it's all about Jesse. Like I like that the getting him in other situations. We're getting so much more of him.

Cuz I feel like or as as fierce I mean to being anti-A because I feel like they did such a better job at this point in the show versus this point in the game of really being like yo he blew her dad's brains out on the floor and the nurses said you didn't even know look at him. And it's like I'm I'm watching this knowing everything obviously but being like I think they're doing a better job of like even if I don't like that they killed Joel, even if I don't like Abby for killing Joel, I think you'd be there earlier be like I get it though.

And so now she's apart. She doesn't have Joel. She doesn't have that moment of, you know, you can feel it where she's there's so many unsaid things between them and now they can never be said.

And then he comes up and he gets to the glass and he's still looking at the fire burning. It was like, damn. You can feel Pedro caring so much about Tommy over there and caring about Jackson in the same way. Tommy sending off, you know, these messages and being pissed off about where the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Joel is or whatever. You had that there. And then to have him now lose Joel and know how much that means, but then have Jackson be like, they did a great job.

I think you're all the narrative pieces and bones are right there. Yeah. I would uh I would say that having Abby have real reasons for why she did things, like real humanistic reasons for why she did things, makes the stakes that much higher for if someone's going to go hunt her down.

Why don't they just like let it go? And I'm like, that's not what it's about, right? Is that what it's about?

I think that works as a reveal just as well as the game does. It's just different. And uh again seeing G's face when they have the flashback and it's shoots the doctor. She's like that was my dad. G was like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] And I'm like cool great the real happened. it still hit and I think now going forward in the story it's going to allow us to see two horribly hateful people at least two more with Tommy added and all that stuff but Ellie and Abby this constant cycle of revenge happening I think it just works very well in the story",
