It makes this movie so much more watchable like in a in a real genuine way because the human element of it is so reminiscent of specifically Nacho Libre less of Napoleon Dynamite. There's like a lot of references to Napoleon Dynamite throughout the movie but the Nacho Libre of it is so apparent for a few things. The first thing is there are a ton of human characters, right? And Jared has refuses to have an ounce of genuine sincerity in the entire film and it's for the better. That is the reason why this movie is so good in my opinion because he doesn't he does the generic like uh you know, oh, we have to have an emotional beat where this character like finds themsself or whatever, but it's",
