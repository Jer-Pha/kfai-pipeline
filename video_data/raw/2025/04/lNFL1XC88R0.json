I'm your host, Nick Scarpino, alongside uh my weapons arbiter for today, Mr. Andy Cortez. Hello, everybody. Very excited for this. I need to come up with a a theme for you for when we do these amazing sponsored streams uh by anybody there. And I don't know. I don't like the weapons arbiter because you're not you're not talking more about guns. You're talking about the tech. Well, right now we're having a visual triangle tribunal. Are you our tribunal like leader? Yeah, I think I believe so. Okay. I believe so. I was going to call you like Oracle or something. I mean, come on. That's a cool word. Oracle is pretty Oracle is a cool word. Welcome in everybody. We are sponsored today by Nvidia. Nvidia gave us a big list of games to choose from to stream.

Everyone was so into Phantom Liberty.\" And I was like, and I and I I trusted my friends. I was like, \"What should I do?\" And all of my friends were like, \"Nick, you don't have the attention span to replay through this entire game.\" But then one of my friends, and I'm not going to call Chris out. I'm not going to call him by name, but one of my friends who shall not be named, but Chris was like, \"Dude, start it over. It's a great experience and it's optimized now, so you'll really enjoy the game.\" And I was like, \"Oh, I like optimized. I like new. I like things that are old, but like are cooler now than new.\" So, I started over and I got maybe a few hours in and then Yeah, I lost focus on it. Yeah, unfortunately. So, what I did this",

Yeah, unfortunately. So, what I did this morning, I downloaded a mod for you, Nick. I went to Nexus Mods and I downloaded an endgame save that puts you right before the final boss, but what that does is it gets you pretty highleveled, gives you a whole buttload of gear, weapons, and skills that we can upgrade, and we could start the DLC right the heck now. That's awesome. I'm very excited about that and I think I will probably play through the rest of this DLC on my own if we don't get through most of it today. Um I don't actually know how long the DLC is. It's not very long. It's like maybe 10 hours maybe. Okay, so we're not going to get to it the whole thing today. No, definitely not. Definitely not.

I don't know what happened to OBS. Sorry, everyone. Technical issues. OBS said that we wanted to record. Maybe there's like a hotkey here that started recording or something.

And there's no better place to do that than in Cyberpunk. Of course. Yeah. Let let me Yeah. Let me go into the hotkeys to see what's up. Uh if we accidentally hit a hotkey for recording, which I don't believe we did, but something happened with OBS. I mean, yeah, it's not even set to anything.

We are playing Cyberpunk 2077 at the highest qu visual quality possible. Full path tracing, not just ray tracing. We're not doing selective reflections or selective sha. It is full path tracing where every ray of light bounces off of surfaces. Bounces off of two surfaces, maybe even three. But there's a lot of surface bouncing is what I'm trying to get to. Everything is being lit accurately. Everything looks absolutely incredible. Every object on every table casting a shadow, right? Like there's there everything is reflecting. Nothing looks like it's out of place. The game looks freaking stunning, you know? Um, we are playing with",

Um, we are playing with DLSS4 and all of that is kind of impossible to do when if you want high frame rate. If you want this game to look incredible, it's really tough to do so and get it above 40 frames per second, you know what I mean? But with DLSS, it drops the resolution here from 1440p down to around like I believe like 720p and then it uses AI to upsample it back up to look just as crisp and amazing. And we're also using frame generation. Frame generation with twice frame generation. So we're getting 135 140 frames with full path tracing. Kind of nuts. Like that just makes no sense to be able to get this many frames. It's looking smooth. It's feeling smooth. Um I think we're freaking ready to rock, Nick. I'm excited about this.

I never really went back to my house in my play. I don't think I ever went back to my house either. I think for the most part, I was just like I was rich as hell. Yeah, but I had a cruddy little house. Yeah, you don't need that cuz you got to live frugal. But uh luckily with this uh save that I downloaded, we're pretty kitted out.

[Music] Um, game looks crisp, game looks smooth, and it's more importantly, it's got ray reconstruction. Ray reconstruction is something we don't talk enough about because it gets a little bit more into the nitty-gritty of visuals, but when ray tracing first sort of debuted on Cyberpunk, the earlier versions of Nvidia Nvidia DLSS made the reflections look kind of noisy a whole bunch and ray reconstruction makes things just look a lot cleaner.

Ready to find out? Hell yeah. We're going to find out. I got some points, by the way. We'll walk up. We'll end the stream right after this little encounter. Sounds good. Once again, we are sponsored by Nvidia today. Showing off the incredible Cyber Bunk 2077 with full path tracing DLSS4. Everything looks amazing. Are they supposed to drive this thing? No. [Music] That's over. Before we go, apologies for the precautions. I only ever risk so much. Sometimes it's just safer to shove the barrel of a Moran between the Trudin's ribs, even if he is on your side. It's nothing personal. No hard feelings, I hope. Odd introduction, but nice meeting you too, Reed. Not a phrase I often",

Not a phrase I often hear in this trade. You're not in Bis V. Albiz. The hell are you watching? Mike, get quit getting distracted. Diplo. I was about to say the hardest, but I'm not going to lie. I called FIA data for info about you. Interesting profile. Freelance MC. You were born an NC Heywood to make things more interesting. FIA agent. You received your commission last night. One thing eludes me. What drove you to get entangled in this mess? Song Brit hired me. Know her? Show me something up. We used to work together. I thought I heard the last about her, but yeah, it girl's a magnet for trouble. Right. It's time we paid our friend in distress a visit. Let's go down. Address, please. Abandoned building on Crest Street, 8th floor. You left her alone in Dogtown. Myers can take care of herself. Not a damsel in",

She is the president. Hold up. I need to take this. His eyes just go blue. Like, look at the road, doc. [Music] Last I heard, you're order manager. Ask Bob. He owes me a favor anyway. Yeah, well, tough nuts. Get after managing val. I work the door at a club selection. I know bouncing, huh? That your Lilo gig? A bouncer? It pays the bills and nets me a little disposable. Sleeper agent. Need a little Easter egg. Government pay before you access the DLC. You can go to that club and see him as the bouncer there. Oh wow. And like they put it in after the fact to make it, you know, he's just still there chilling. [\u00a0__\u00a0] right there. Am I right? Yeah, sure. I guess",

It's high time we help her out. Skip the ride. Music's kind of vibing here. I like it, dude. We weren't too far away anyway, but it's still fun. All right, James. Let's go.
