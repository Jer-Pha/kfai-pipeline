How does your tummy feel? Uh, my tummy feels great, but you know what? Conversation out there. You were sending KMA messages to Roger, the worst responder ever. He's done this multiple times where he just sends you one-word responses and you're like, I just need to know if you're at work tomorrow because if I call Greg Miller because I'm having some problems at 9:30 in the morning, who's going to step up?

That's I wrote I wrote, \"Hey, Slappy, this is important. Are you working tomorrow?\" and he wrote back triple question marks and all I needed was a yes or no. I do believe the reporting I heard give me the reporting was that you texted Roger last night work tomorrow. You work tomorrow. I think I don't think there was a U in there. Well, maybe someone I think it was work tomorrow. There was a lot of things happening. You know what I mean?

This is more than just upscaling graphics and bumping up to frame rate. Why not call it a remake?\" Snowike Mike.

You would have to talk with game devs. We would have to all come together and say this is it. We're planting the flag on what these two words mean and how they should be seen. What's interesting I think is uh you know when they the presentation they the we talked about it from Wesley in pools report and they call it a gameplay video which of course is true and you're watching it right now. There was a long basically SGF style presentation what you'd expect where it is the devs talking about this and them talking to Bethesda game studios talking to Virtuos about like what this means to them and what they've done and yada yada yada and one of the comments there explaining it was that it's still the Elder",

Yeah. So, I think that's where we get into it. We've argue this all the time, but I think it is the fact that they didn't touch, and I know we just listed a bunch of things, but they didn't, it sounds like they didn't touch the core engine of what the game is. And so, that would then disqualify it from being a remake, at least in their eyes. I'm we're all with you. I have the the the chart. I see it. Like, I I understand. You understand what I'm saying, right? Because it's not like they completely started from scratch, built it from the ground up. I think if you go from the ground up, that's a remake, obviously.

Yeah, I'm looking at this and I'm like, I can't wait to die. They added sprinting into this. That's a big deal. I mean, there's pieces of this that go far beyond just the coat of paint, right? And so, yeah, no matter how you want to slice it, it's an exciting thing, right? Bringing this back from 20 years ago, your mind starts to wonder of like, could we get something more in the Bethesda universe? Another big remake that we all want, right?

The Elder Scrolls Oblivion Remaster Deluxe Edition includes all the above and adds bonus quests, unique weapon sets, unique armor sets, unique unique horse armor sets, digital art book, and official soundtrack. There's more to go. Go get that if you want. Uh I liked uh if you remember, Starfield had the digital art book, and I really found that fascinating. We would use that before the pre-streams of just putting it up and it would cycle through all the artwork up on the screen cuz we're kind of moving past the days of getting the physical stuff. We're kind of in this 50/50. We're moving past that. But I like that the soundtrack, Greg, the soundtrack on this game bangs, my man.

Can we move this to like before the weekend when everybody's going to be playing it? They got to hide the Easter egg. You got to make the ham. Yeah. The the other question is just because I I forgot when this came out. Like why not save this for the 20th, you know? Like you're about to hit the 20th anniversary next year unless they have a busy next year. I mean, my my knee-jerk would be I think that well, I think they just want to make money.

It's not like it's going anywhere. They're not taking it off the service. So, I can play Oblivion all week and then Expedition 33 next week or vice versa. Or you play both. I think gamers play a lot of games. We shouldn't worry about one game taking over their life. I don't know if gamers play a lot of games. I think people who watch the show play a lot of games. I think gamers play multiple games a day. I I don't think what gamers out there play one game only for weeks on end. We're painting with a very broad brush, you know what I mean?

Um I my take on this is it cuts both ways where I think you can look at it as overshadowing Claire obscure expedition 33 if that delivers the experience we all think it's going to deliver. Uh but in the same breath, I do think they're very different. But like I'm part of that breath where it's like I'm not a turn-based guy. I like the demo I did of Expedition 33. I'm excited to see if that'll hook me and keep me going. But now Oblivion goes to the top of the pile because I know I love that kind of game. I know how many people love this game. I'm hoping it connects. I'm hoping I I lock in. But it could also be that I jump in and even though old game is new, old game is new but still has old systems and I'm like, \"Ah, this I Why don't I just",

Why don't I just play go I I had been tinkering a long time ago going back to Starfield or um Skyrim. Then of course we're doing the ESO show which we want to stream when we're done with the four episodes. I've gone in and made a character. I've tinkered. I enjoy what I'm playing there. Why don't I go do that? There's a lot that could go wrong on this and and send you off of that. Right. The other side to it on the positive side is I think that Expedition 33 is a game that again, knock on wood delivers. We all liked what we previewed. It delivers that in a review sense. And again, the people who listen to shows like this and consume games like we consume them, either jump right on it or know to do it or whatever. The other",

The other hope would be, as Xbox is always trying to do with this Game Pass thing, is they want a big game to bring you in to get it right now. And then before you cancel your subscription, you look around and you go, \"Oh, this Expedition game came out and I saw that it got great reviews. Oh, South of Midnight's on here. I remember a lot of people liking that. Oh, I never did a vowed.\" like they want a library surrounding this. I think that when you come in for the big thing like Oblivion bringing you back, I know it won't be a astronomical number, but Oblivion getting remastered, dropping today, getting headlines is going to catch the eye of people who have lapsed in games who haven't played since Oblivion or haven't done whatever or have a soft spot for that game and it will make them go, \"Oh, but I can",

Maybe there's never enough time in anybody's day to play all the games you want to play. But in the long run, I don't I don't know if the Oblivion conversation is going to be so long tail that it just runs ruckshot over expedition 33. My hope would be that game delivers. So you have this big jump today. When Barrett, when is Expedition 33 out? It's imminent. Is it 26th? 25th? I want to say is it Friday? It's this week, I think. It's Friday, I think. Right.

Are they going to play another 100 hours of it? Or is it going to be you jump back in, you get that comfort food, it looks so good. I'm back at it.

And this is fascinating because the examples it gives as remakes is The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening, Crash Insane trilogy, and then Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. All of which I would say are fundamentally different than what this game is, right? But the site is saying that it's a remake.

Uh, Pretty Dude Super Chats and says, \"Exbox/icrosoft is having quite the year currently.

They were quiet at the first half and then really punched it with a lot of games in the second half and we wanted it to be spread out and share the love and they're hitting that right now.

Um, just go with the story. Get lost in it. And if you show up to a part of the DLC where maybe it's a little too much for you, back out and go the opposite direction.
