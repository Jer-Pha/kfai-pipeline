Well, not entirely exuberant. This comes from Easy Allies, which recently interviewed Shuhei Yosha about, among other things, his reaction to the Switch 2 reveal. Here's his response in full when asked about it. Quote, \"To me, it was a bit of a mixed message from Nintendo. In a sense, I think Nintendo is losing their identity in my opinion.

Is there anything immediately pops to mind for you? This might be a question in chat as well. I mean, it's hard to I would And you said no Call of Duty, no GTA. Yeah. No games for for sales numbers, I guess. Oh, maybe a Nintendo Switch, too. So, I don't know what that's going to look like. People are saying night reign. I don't believe that.
