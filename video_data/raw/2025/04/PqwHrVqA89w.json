But interesting that we didn't drop this Thursday or Friday last week when everybody had a longer holiday. We waited until Tuesday and it's been the worst kept secret because we've known about it for a while now. But it is out of like, well, the secret's out. Can we move this to like before the weekend when everybody's going to be playing it? They got to hide the Easter egg. You got to make the ham. Yeah. The the other question is just because I I forgot when this came out, like why not save this for the 20th, you know, like you're about to hit the 20th anniversary next year, unless they have a busy next year. I mean, my my kneejerk would be I think that Well, I think they just want to make money.

And they're filming that now, right? So that's probably next year. I would think of, hey, let's get that out and see if we can ride the success of that. Yeah. No, there will be a lot of discussion. You could already see it when we talked about it yesterday. Me and Jerica, a lot of people were a little upset about over, you know, too many games now kind of stepping on the toes of Claire Obscura. Uh, Expedition Mitchell Super says, \"Any worry of this overshadowing Expedition 33, or is both being on Game Pass mean it'll have a chance to shine?\" I personally think they're two very separate games.

There will be some overlap, but I don't think me personally, I think gamers just win of going, I have a bunch of games. They're on Game Pass. It's not like it's going anywhere. They're not taking it off the service. So, I can play Oblivion all week and then Expedition 33 next week or vice versa. Or you play both. I think gamers play a lot of games. We shouldn't worry about one game taking over their life. I don't know if gamers play a lot of games. I think people who watch the show play a lot of games. I think gamers play multiple games a day.

In terms of who we're talking about. Matt Piscatella wants to break through the wall right now and tell you a whole bunch of stats about it. Um I my take on this is it cuts both ways where I think you can look at it as overshadowing Claire uh obscure expedition 33 if that delivers the experience we all think it's going to deliver. Uh but in the same breath I do think they're very different but like I'm part of that breath where it's like I'm not a turn-based guy. I like the demo I did of Expedition 33. I'm excited to see if that'll hook me and keep me going. But now Oblivion goes to the top of the pile cuz I know I love that kind of game. And I know how many people love this game. I'm hoping it connects. I'm hoping I I lock in. But it could also be that I jump in and even though old game is new, old game is new",

Why don't I just play go I I had been tinkering a long time ago going back to Star Field or um Sky Rim. Then of course we're doing the ESO show which we want to stream when we're done with the four episodes. I've gone in and made a character. I've tinkered. I enjoy what I'm playing. Why don't I go do that? There's a lot that could go wrong on this and and send you off of that. Right. The other side to it on the positive side is I think that Expedition 33 is a game that again, knock on wood delivers. We all liked what we previewed. It delivers that in a review sense.

And again, the people who listen to shows like this and consume games like we consume them either jump right on it or know to do it or whatever. The other hope would be, as Xbox is always trying to do with this Game Pass thing, is they want a big game to bring you in to get it right now. And then before you cancel your subscription, you look around and you go, \"Oh, this Expedition game came out and I saw that it got great reviews. Oh, South of Midnight's on here. I remember a lot of people liking that. Oh, I never did a vowed.\" Like they want a library surrounding this. I think that when you come in for the big thing like Oblivion bringing you back, I know it won't be a astronomical number, but Oblivion getting remastered, dropping today, getting headlines is going to catch the eye of people who have lapsed in games who haven't played since Oblivion or haven't done whatever or",

There's never enough time in anybody's day to play all the games you want to play. But in the long run, I don't I don't know if the Oblivion conversation is going to be so long tail that it just runs ruckshot over expedition 33. My hope would be that game delivers. So you have this big jump today. When Barrett, when is Expedition 33 out? It's imminent. Is it 26th? 25th? I want to say is it Friday? It's this week, I think. It's Friday, I think. Right.

I I get where you're coming from.

Granted, he's making the game, but I really do see that could easily be a lot of people are going to jump back into Game Pass to try it to play it, but I don't know, are they going to have are they going to roll credits on it? Are they going to play another 100 hours of it? Or is it going to be you jump back in, you get that comfort food, it looks so good. I'm back in it.

In Imperial, you play as a mercenary sent to a distant planet to discover the mysteries of an ancient civilization. Powers unknown lie within the monolith, but those are no mere ruins as an expedition has already ventured inside with only a few survivors. Why was it built? What powers reside within? Who is at the center of the monolith? All these secrets and more will be uncovered if you are brave enough to take on Imperial.

Well, again, hopefully Expedition 33 is great and just cancels out whatever the It'll be fantastic for me. It'll be great. Uh let's get some other people in here.

And I think they're showing it right now that they can keep that going throughout the year, all 12 months to justify you paying for that, which is great. You say justify you paying for it. Let's talk more about your dollars and cents.

Chad is saying it is on Game Pass PC uh vanilla. So, there you go. Uh but back to it. $49.99, $59.99 for deluxe. How you feeling about this price?

Uh Mike, as my Oblivion expert, since you're here, Marco super chats in and says, \"As someone who will be playing Oblivion for the first time, is there a specific time that you would recommend to jump into the DLC?\" Yeah, it's been a long time for me, uh Marggo, so I don't know the perfect answer for you, but my answer will always be whenever I play these games.
