It it was one of the weirdest trips where went to New York on a Tuesday, came back on a Thursday and across time for New York in the middle of the week. It throws you off in a way where it's just like all your timing is like just whacked. So like I didn't know what day it was. I still don't. I mean I guess it's a Monday. That's a nice little reset point. But yeah, getting into the weekend, every day I woke up thinking I was going to work, you know. Yeah, that's crazy. Uh of course joining us as well is it's Christmas in April. Miss Joey Noel, how you doing? I'm doing well. That's a weird one, too, because you guys had so many early mornings that like your buddy had no idea what time zone you were in. No. And like it and lack of sleep. It got crazier and crazier because like the day one, our flight in San Francisco was at 6:00 a.m. to",

So, obviously having to wake up hours before that to get to the airport and do that whole thing. So, that was crazy. But then the next day, we had to be at the Nintendo event at 7:00 a.m. New York time, which for us was 4:00 a.m., which meant we had to wake up even earlier to get there. And like doing the math on that, that's where I started falling apart. Especially because I was so excited like a kid waiting for Christmas that I woke up every hour. Yeah. So I was like this weekend I made up for it though. This weekend Oh man. Just slept the entire weekend.

All that God, you're such a Don't talk to me, Nick. Uh, the Nintendo stuff obviously great. That aside, obviously New York, one of the coolest places on planet Earth.

I was so sad when they left Stones down, too. It's crazy, right? And again, that's some of that is retail theft. Some of that is um and my understanding is that there's just less foot traffic in that area cuz fewer people are there. And then some of it retail is just like dying, right?

Um, which was like the incredible like this is where all the rich boutiquey [\u00a0__\u00a0] is and they had that like food center and stuff. But even then that was a problem because pre- pandemic it's like that it wasn't sustainable because like the rich people weren't trying to go there. The rich people were going to going up north or even like further south to go to these malls. Well, you also have was never doing well to begin with. You have the divide of market too, right? which is like when you go over market actually all those stores are still doing okay. You've got but they're high-end.

It's just the mega mall concept is just became unsustainable. And then once Nordstrom bailed out of their their lease, I think Bloomingdales was ne the theater was first, right? Theater was like we're done. We can't do this any and then I think Bloomingdales is gone now. And so movie theater left, but basically what that's that so that was what the Nordstrom looked like. Uh if you go back to that one picture, Kev, just one back to your left. That's that's a lot of retail space. That's a lot of foot traffic.
