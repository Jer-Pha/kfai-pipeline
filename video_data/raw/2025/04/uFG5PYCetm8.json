Um, but then that weekend afterwards, you know, if we were like, \"Let's celebrate. Let's go to the theaters and watch something.\" And we watched this movie. Uh, which I knew nothing about. And he knew nothing about. I've never seen an alien movie before. He did, but I didn't know that.

June 8th, 2012 is when this was first released. Directed by Ridley Scott. Uh the music was done by Mark Stryenfeld and uh it has a running time of 124 minutes, just a little bit over two hours, a budget of 130, and a box office of 403 million.

He just loves that [\u00a0__\u00a0] Um, and so I've se I I was quite aware of this movie for quite some time and I I don't think it's a particularly good movie, but I I really like this movie and I think a lot of it has to despite all the times I'm just like, \"Oh man, this movie is so close to being like great.\" Like this movie is so close to being an awesome movie, but they all like the writers just always chose the wrong decisions in certain key pivotal moments",

Why are they always choosing the wrong dumbest thing to do? Why are you running that way from the thing falling on you? It's a wheel. It only goes one way.

I'm going to I'm going to jump in next cuz I feel like in in a lot of ways I'm aligned with you. I think that I might even be slightly higher than you because I would argue that this is a good movie. It's just not a great movie, but I do not think that it is bad. I think that they have a bunch of misses.

Near the end of the movie, I'm like, Wong has said four things. Yeah, they know they didn't know he's gonna be Wong back then. Yeah. So, that that stuff um that all of that is there. But there's something about this movie compared to all the other ones we watched where I really appreciate it trying to do something and say something in the world that we now have established. Like the this is the most philosophical of the movies.

Um, and in this, like I don't fully understand everything, but I do think that they had a vision and they stuck to it. And that's when I think sci-fi is at its best. And I don't think sci-fi is always going to work. You take the swings and sometime it's going to be the most amazing thing ever and sometimes it gets a little messy because when you have all these characters asking like where did we come from and who are we?

And I think that the I'm right there with your dad. Like I can't not like a movie that looks this good when it looks this good. Otherwise, it's very dark and blue and like a couple choices I just don't love. But the amount of Vista shots are like Death Stranding was so inspired by this. Like it's utterly stunning.

Yeah. with those keys that the starfield uh intergalactic like I I don't know what to call that but it's space fairing.

Getting like that type of lore backstory stuff. It can feel very solo the movie type. But I liked this stuff cuz I feel like it it was additive. But the moment he picks up the little flute and then he plays the score and it is this uplifting thing to like activate it all. There's a culture there and I'm like this is I do it for the culture.

Um, this movie is a, you know, it was Ridley's attempt at broadening and reimagining sort of the origins of the Alien like franchise basically.

But I every the more I watch this movie, the less I like it. Um uh simply because it just does not in any way, shape or form come together for me. I think the the characterizations are zany. Like Chariss Theon is an amazing actor. I [\u00a0__\u00a0] love her in in in Fury Road. I hate her in this movie. I hate her in this movie.

That's what I didn't like about I just hated how cartoudishly evil she is. Like I don't feel like she doesn't feel like a real human being. Just all like being a dick.

Yeah. And I hate it. So, all the characterizations for me are off. I don't like the Hol character. I don't particularly care for the Shaw character. I either I think that she's obviously our protagonist in this, but the other guy, her her, you know, counterpart, her partner in this hallway, not Bane.

Um, and ultimately, Tim, I think you hit the nail on the head for me. I had a note here. I was like, \"This movie does for the Alien franchise what Solo did for Star Wars, which is nothing. It does not really set up anything of any interest to me. And it serves only to define things that kind of destroy the original imagination of of what I had when I when I walked out of well actually when I walked out of my living room from watching Alien One the first time, right?

I guess you're right. I guess you're right. I just I just always felt like this the the ship in in my brain needs to be in orders of magnitude like tenfold when you see it outside from what's inside for me to make sense of that. Like I I like the concept that the Nestromo was this like big ship but attached to this massive mining vessel that just seems so big in scale that it's like you know uh it's overwhelming to you. And this just I was like I don't know if he's I don't know if he'd have that much space to to ride a bicycle around",

All right. He says Numei Pace is Swedish. Then you know what? Stop doing a French accent. So, the I I love the art direction in this movie. I don't love that everything is way more like futuristic looking than anything we've seen.

It's like my favorite part of this Reddit thread is like the quote from Ridley Scott about him being Jesus. The guy is like, \"I am not pulling this out of my ars Reddit.\" This is a quote from Ridley Scott. Like, they were going to put it in the film, but he said it was too on the nose.
