I think you might be a a Honey Nut Cheerio guy. That's my final. That's my That's my final guess right there. First off, Fruity Pebbles way off. Wow. I would never [\u00a0__\u00a0] with a Fruity Pebble. I wouldn't I wouldn't be caught in the same room as a Fruity Pebble.

I'm not necessarily a chocolatey dude, but uh the thing about pebbles, you got to eat them way faster and they get soggy really really quickly. So, it's like I love cocoa pebbles, but only under the correct circumstances. Um, Honey Nut Cheerios I really love. I eat them without milk.

But also, you have the same issue though cuz like they when you put enough milk in there, they just get too soggy. Like they don't have enough structure. I think because the Fruity Pebbles lack real estate and you know um like size that they they have when the Fruity Pebble and the Cocoa Pebble lacks the size it becomes soggy faster. Fastier is what I said. Yeah, I mean I really lost my Wilson fist. Yeah, that was rough. Yeah, but here's the thing. Roger, you know. Oh, he's back. It's a penguin. We're so back.

And immediately I'm like, \"Look at this company's this studio's identity.\" And then uh people in chat told me actually last year they laid off 80% of their workforce. That is and that they finished I think the last year of development on this game they had I don't know something like 15 people working there. So something very very small. Uh those numbers are all kind of arbitrary cuz there a bunch of different articles had different numbers up. It was 70 people laid off, 60 people laid off, 80 people laid off.

I thought it was runner until just now, so I was like, \"Oh, Runner, something different.\" Yeah. Yeah. Their first game, uh, Ruiner. Ruiner. Very cool vibes. Very red and cyber punk. And that looks awesome, though. That game looks sick. Metal Eden demo is out available. It's available everywhere. You ever released it? Play it on Steam. I think it's May 7th. And immediately people in chat were like, \"Oh, cool.

Apparently, it's not super great. Uh, ran great on PC. Um, if you have a really good uh machine, is it a contender? I don't know yet. I don't think it's fun enough. Yeah. Well, is there any is there any difference? Is there any hook here? The the hook of it is you are first person shooting and smaller enemies, you can yank their core out. And everybody knows I love yanking cores. All right, it's recor all over again. Um except here the the yanking of the core not as satisfying as I would as I would have hoped. You know, there's a cool thing about recor where you are kind of shooting the enemies and then you have to it takes a while. There's like a push and a pull to take, you know, to yank that core out.

So, it kind it'll make your melee stronger and it'll heal you or you could toss it at enemies and it delivers. You can level this up as well. You can the explosion will kind of have like a little AoE explosion effect if a lot of enemies are around. Um they will all get affected, but then when they die, they will also drop ammo. And so you kind of in that push and pull mechanic of uh I need a health, but I also maybe need ammo, whatever the hell. It's it's it's kind of a cool thing.

They're making them on sale again. I thought they were going to take them off, Roger. So people will still have an opportunity to come to our gaming universe, be a part of these characters in these worlds and see value, if you will, in whatever rung of the platform they'd come in.

This is an executive making a statement about his company saying, \"Yeah, some people may not be able to afford it. Some people will always not be able to afford the thing you're putting out.\" Yeah.

So it didn't even make sense to buy the last one if you're going to buy the next one. This one full backwards compatibility. If you buy everything on Switch one, you're going to be able to bring it over to Switch 2. So again, not a bad answer here for what he's saying, but I understand how it is. You know, it's sensitive topic right now. Everyone's everyone's mad about the price. Could have worded it better probably.

It's it's it's another one of those situations where the parent company says we're going to have you work on this and then maybe, you know, I also wouldn't doubt that whatever this project they're working on isn't just it wasn't working out. things, you know, it it could have just been up top leadership going games as a service is just not where we need to be. Look at the look at the industry. Look at the way things are moving. That is such a money pit to continue to pour funds into when a game comes out and then 7 months in you hear, \"Oh, player count is only this.
