But, in other words, like I, believe it or not, I'm not looking to fill my vault up with all these minmax items. Um, I honestly am getting a bit exhausted by that across so many games. And so, we'll see how they handle that, but I certainly have my feedback on that's what I'm looking for in this reveal is like they probably won't show you how loot and all that's being dealt with, but I get stressed out of having to clear these vaults all the time.

Yeah. Michael, what kind of Borderlands player are you? Yeah, I think uh Borderlands is the beloved and special franchise to me, right? Growing up, Borderlands 1 and 2 is that co-op experience you share with your friends together online. It was uh something really, really cool. Borderlands 3 I had a ton of fun with.

Borderlands is for a little bit younger audience, but they have the jokes that will still make me smile. I will say one of the things that I am excited for for this Borderlands 4 is the fact that it seems like the writing team this time around seems a bit like uh lots of people lots of people that I'm familiar with.

Like I forget the joke they referenced. What's the toilet guy mean? Yeah. He was like, \"I'm not letting Skippy toilet touch this game.\" For me, that gave me some faith. Where are you? Um, yeah. I was going to bring up that same point with that Bless brought up is like there a lot of the writing team feels brand new this time around and is like, \"Hey, we know how you all felt about Borderlands 3.

I love just shooting, clicking heads. It's a fun video game with awesome progression, and I want cool boss fights. Like I it's always a nice time that especially with all of these other multiplayer games that are seemingly leaning away from story and co-op and NPCs and everything. You know, it feels like every shooter nowadays is going for this extraction thing or team based thing.

There's surely got to be a good commercial reason to shift the day.\" And to be clear, again, they moved it because of other games release dates. That's the whole point.

But in Borderlands 3, they drop too often. This not only devalued legendaries, it made everything feel less valuable. In our new system, not only do all guns feel great, but now legendaries will truly be special events.

These vault hunters seemed way more interesting and way uh more fun to to use this time around. I like the abilities that I was seeing. I liked the grapple hook uh you know, only to certain spots, but still that's Is that a bummer for you? Did you want that to be grappling? Of course. Of course. But I don't know how feasible that could be. You know, I could totally see why they would want to",

It did feel more like a Destiny or a Far Cry with the tone of it all. And I thought, man, that just doesn't feel like Borderlands.

The quality of life when it comes to playing with friends, everybody being able to choose their own difficulty, fast traveling to players, right? Everybody gets their own loot, full crossplay.

Yeah, as usual, I would have a ton to say, so feel free to reel me in, but I think probably best to respond to like what Mike just said. I I did notice from production level, yeah, like it seems like they were very excited to be like, \"Look, we want to show you the new world. we want to show you these new abilities. It's a lot to take in. We've got a new UX and like they're so focused on that. Um it really didn't show the tone of Borderlands. That being said, I'm not doubting that it's there.

It was like a production thing almost real. It almost felt like they were working with a third party not good at game shows, a third party or like you know how this goes in production. It could have just been something with putting it together, getting it done. And anyway, so they showed a lot of new stuff and yeah, for me uh I could go a lot on the visuals. I will say I've always been hoping for a bigger upgrade, but this was the first time I did get to see the gameplay and I'm like, well, it does look like really crisp, nicely tuned shaded.

And so I think coming in and saying grounded doing that is setting it differently. Yeah, I if I may I do would just a thousand% agree. They showed gameplay. They actually tried to explain the game to you and the too often things get trapped in marketing and like so I think it's fair to ding them on like your marketing tone wasn't what I expected but dude so happy that you were focused on gameplay.

Like you're going here and then random fights are going to pop up, but then oh look at there's this thing, the silo where you go in and there's a vault key fragment that could if you get enough of them, you unify to get a vault and get your own vault. And it's like that is very interesting to me in terms of what momentto- moment gameplay is going to be. Excites the hell out of me. They've always talked I mean Borderlands has always been ahead of the curve I feel in terms of co-op and drop in drop out.

And I think I do I don't disagree that I think the movement is maybe about 10 to 15% a little too slow.

You even though we might have a larger open space you are still going and going step by step with your friends and being like oh I'm actually on this mission. Yeah hop in.

The classic Dave Clayman sketch, right? Or like a bajillion guns, whatever. But it was the gameplay and the guns in this and the replay-ability and running it. I don't remember Borderlands 1 being and then there was this boss. There was like the worm creature you fought to grind, but it's like you weren't there. Borderlands 2 was the one that came out and was like, \"Here's all that awesome gameplay and compelling villain that's awesome and here's this humor we're doing.\" And it really was all these different things that came together that we were like, \"Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0]",

And so I don't know. I No, I don't think Yeah, the twins at all lived up to Handsome Jack's legacy. But again, once that jig is up, can anybody cuz then you especially when you start iterating and trying to do like Borderlands 1 to Borderlands 2, you expect that direct sequel to be like, \"Okay, cool. We're taking what we learned and Pandora and everything else to stay on Pandora for as long as we have and do so much and have it all be so Pandora influenced.\" I would have loved to got here.

Yeah, it's I mean, it's really tough, though. I I think maybe we're still talking about what they're improving on, like what are they doing with it.

I think the visuals, it's the biggest thing. If they just looked different and had the same like gameplay stuff they're talking about, um, maybe some of the tone, I don't think we'd have this reaction. So, I just don't think that because it looks like more of the same. It's kind of hard to to get around that because you're like, \"Oh, I was expecting it to look different.\" But I just I just want metal materials to look like metal materials.

Each cardoggram affects which enemies, boss fights, and loot will appear when you enter the monolith, so no two excursions will be the same. Find even more cardiggrams to explore by looting defeated enemies, or buy them from other players online at the trading post.

I usually you want to say it's crossplay, cross progression. Yeah. Cross platform, whatever. Yeah. There's somebody earlier in chat that said um that called out that Marvel Rivals doesn't even have cross progression.

The augment system, but those were like what you can build your skill tree and then slot in augments, but then they also have the ordinance stuff on top of it. And like it's a lot on top of modding. So you have your action skills, three class defining abilities. Then you have augments that get plugged in and change those skills. And so this is where they were showing. So we're switching our class defining ability to the animal who's a trouble. And then when you activate this, then you're changing how trouble works. And they show of course changing the elemental effect of your gun, changing the elemental damage that trouble's doing, which is pretty dope. And that's what I was trying to point out. I think right it's on the fly. You don't even have to reset your skill tree. No, it didn't look like that. It's basically like I",

Toxic gem or whatever and then boom. So I think all of that combined we got to see in action. But it's Yeah, it's exciting for all the build potential for sure. Yeah. But again, that's where I gloss over. I'm dedicated. I just build out the skill tree, Andy. I know my things and I go off and I fight. I'm not worried about my build. It would be it would be a really nice accessibility thing to at the start of the game be like this is my end goal just auto just do it auto automatically. Yeah.

I mean, this is definitely going to be a a play for me, of course, with the Borderlands just love that I've always had. Um I'm looking forward to it and I'm hoping for some good laughs, Brandy. Yeah, of course I'm looking forward to it. It's just you get I like all games, I have to go hands-on with them, see them in person to really judge them. But I am excited.

Yeah, I'll I'll be doing Steam and and probably PlayStation so that I can get my trophies, but I can also play in bed on the deck natively and all that jazz.
