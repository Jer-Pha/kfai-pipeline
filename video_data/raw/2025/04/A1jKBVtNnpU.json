Do you need to get it? Uh, well, it needs to finish. Okay. Once this game kicks on, then we'll turn it on. Okay. But, uh, Nick, you and I, this week is a special week. It's just you and I in here. Kevin's going to set us up and then he's going to go cuz it's going to get a little weird and funky in here. Mike, you said to me, you said we need to get into Tarov. And I said, absolutely. Mhm. And then I said, \"What's Tarov?\" And you said, \"Oh, Nick, Taroff is it.\" Mike, explain to people, the uninitiated, what this experience is going to be for. Yeah.

We are going to jump into the fascinating, punishing, and possibly fun world of Escape from Tarov. We've been riding a high of extraction shooters. I've been trying to find games that Nick would vibe with and be interested in. And he is interested in Escape from Taroff. And I said, \"Nick, what if we go from noob to pros for one full week? We only try Escape from Taroff.\" And he said, \"Mike, I'll ride with you.\" And so I had Kevin come with me and we proceeded to make a bunch of new scenes that two of them don't work, but we have this just chatting and doubleshot. But we will work those in. But I said, Nick, yes, let's just give the audience what would it what it",

Give us room to grow. Give us room to learn.\" And so you and I, Nick, throughout this week, Tuesday through Friday, are going to play Escape from Tarov. I have given them my credit card information.

Yeah, two players per team. Definitely not five players. Five players. Definitely not the kind of game where we definitely are going to clash with teams of five versus two, but we're going to have some fun, Mike. We're going to have some fun, Nick.
