Get out of here. suffer through all this Switch 2 stuff forever just constantly saying, \"What's happening at Cinema?\" There's nothing more sweat. There's nothing more boring than a sequel or remake of a stupid thing. You know what I mean? Shut up. Thank you for ending your Pokemon stream early for me. It is, like I said, Thursday, April 3rd. This is the kind of funny screencast uh is a show we talk about movies and things on.

Oh, Kell. Kell. It's going to be Alan Tudyk. Too many jokes, too many bad jokes. We're going to play some of those. But they're entertaining and that and some of them will hit. Yeah. All that stuff is uh it's silly and it's whimsical and it's fun and it's very comic booky. And the fact they have this like this crazy Kryptonian beautifully designed sort of like past future look of like a a sun gun that will heal him is great. Well, I mean, yeah, sorry.

It'll be here before you know it, of course. But yeah, I'm right there with you of like what a delightful treat. And then even yeah watching it like I think even for me as a Superman fan and a James Gun fan setting the tone so well of what you're getting right like I love that the you know one of my jokes was from the original trailer it was a man putting crypto into this yada yada yada a superpowered dogs never worked for me because what you know it's hard to believe that dog's going to listen and so for Crypto to run up and just be",

It's cut very much like yeah that's a serious take yeah like this dog is going to be his sidekick and maybe like the the you know Watson to Holmes where he might be actually a little bit more confident than homes in in some areas.

Maybe we get a beat in the third act where the dog saves something saves the day when Lex Luthther tries to raid the Fortress of Solitude for the Kryptonian tech or something like that. But for the most part, it's going to be a story about Superman and Lois Lane. And I think that's and the city of Metropolis. So, I I'm hoping that's what we get with this because I don't as much as I love the dog, if it ain't Rocket Raccoon, I don't need it in the movie the entire time. Man, I can't I want to watch it again. I want to talk about everything and why, you know, it's a top level why I love it again for a tone setter.

Most of the people see comic book movies haven't. Would you like to pull from those? But I mean, like, you know, one of the things uh James has been so upfront about like is pulling from Allstar Superman and All-Star Superman is a tale of science fiction. It is like ray guns and weird stuff and you know cosmic juice you're drinking to give lowest powers and it's very golden agy while being there. So to have that level of comedy sure that's great but then to run into the fortress and have it be here's this psychotic weap like not weapon but sun gun like you called it that we're going to spin the fortress to bring it in the robots are there like that's awesome.

Um, we I've I've never seen The Forest of Solitude be hidden before. It's always been just out in the middle of nowhere. And you know, in the 80s it was like no one could possibly understand where the Arctic is. We we didn't understand how satellites work back then. Now we've got tech moguls who launch satellites into the [\u00a0__\u00a0] sky every single day and there's not a single, you know, sector or inch of the of There's a way up in the Arctic right now.

I liked the tone of Man of Steel. I liked that it was a departure from what we had seen prior and I think that was very, very smart. It just didn't necessarily work.
