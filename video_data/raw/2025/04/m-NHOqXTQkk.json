Let's see what you got, Jordan.\" Crushing it. Clear obscure expedition 33 has shipped 1 million units according to developer Sandfall Interactive. And that doesn't include players who've played the game on Game Pass. The developer has announced that the game, the studio's debut title, has shipped 1 million copies, noting that this number includes physical copies. Who put that? Who tried it? Who tried it? You tried it, you son of a [\u00a0__\u00a0] I thought it was cute. Tried physical copies uh shipped to the store rather than 1 million copies sold directly to customers.

As an elite mercenary, you'll join the expedition tasked with unearthing the secrets of the monolith and face off against the deadly automatons within. In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith, accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams. Each cardoggram affects which enemies, boss fights, and loot will appear when you enter the monolith. So, no two excursions will be the same. Find even more cardiggrams to explore by looting defeated enemies or buy them from other players online at the trading post.
