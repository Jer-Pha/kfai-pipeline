We're going to be doing the final Thunderbolts trailer and the latest Fantastic 4 First Steps trailer. Very, very excited. We have not seen either of these trailers. We're going to see them for the very first time along with you. This is about to be a lot of fun. I'm Tim Gettys. I'm joined by Greg Miller. Hello. and Nick Scarpino. Hello. How you doing today, Nick? I am doing well. I was going to sing It feels like the first time, but I don't think I got that range right now in my voice. I'm excited. It feels like the very first time. Okay. Yeah. Gotcha. Got to know what you were doing there. But, uh, yeah, excited about this. Uh, couple couple interesting things uh that I just noticed. Not that this matters too much because of how the MCU's kind of uh been, but uh Thunderbolts the final film of phase five. Fantastic. The first film of phase six. Wow. And what's what's interesting",

But would you believe that there's only four Marvel Studios movies on the docket like after Thunderbolts including Fantastic 4 and Spider-Man Brand New Day. So our lineup Yeah. in movie wise. Yeah. If things stay the same, which again I'll believe it when I see it with the stuff. But we have Thunderbolts. Yeah. Followed by Fantastic 4 First Steps. Avengers Doomsday May 2026. Spider-Man Brand New Day July 2026. Avengers Secret Wars May 2027. So that's awesome. If if that happens and if they pull off a story where it's like they're actually setting things up and there's a narrative going through that could be all time [\u00a0__\u00a0] That's pretty cool.

You include Thunderbolt in that as being well good back. You know what I mean? Like I have no hype for Thunderbolts. So that's the thing. I mean again we're about to watch the trailer so we'll see if that changes for you, Greg. But uh 6 to midnight. There we go. It being the end of phase five and like Fantastic 4 being fa like phase six right now looks incredibly exciting on paper, right? Yeah. Thunderbolts being the end of phase five, obviously a lot less exciting, but there's a couple caveats there. Now the thing with Thunderbolts is I don't expect any of us to be excited for Thunderbolts. When we see the lineup, it's like",

I mean, it's got a great cast. Don't get me wrong. I'm not I, you know, I like Florence Pew. I like David Harour. I love Sebastian Stain. Like, I I like who's even the John Walker guy and Julie Louie Drifus. Like, they've got the things in there. That's White Russell, bro. That's Kurt Russell's kid.

And so I don't know. Actually, I want to show Greg that trailer. We should show Greg that trailer. Oh man. Well, because I know Greg's not really he doesn't really check the internet ever, so he probably hasn't seen that trailer at all. Yeah, I don't I don't think he has. Uh Thunderbolts.

This is not going to be the vibe of Thunderbolts. I hope it is there. I mean, it'd be freaking amazing. It'd be freaking amazing if they went for like what New Mutants went for where it's like, \"Oh, we're gonna make a cool edgy horror movie.\" That didn't work out so well.
