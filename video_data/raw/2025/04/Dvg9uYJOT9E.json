We just spent the entire day for the very first time playing the Nintendo Switch, too. Yeah, we did. And how are you feeling right now? Oh, I'm feeling so good. It's been such a great day, right? We got to we got to play a lot of games that we're going to talk about over the course of many different episodes of Games Cast, right? little small mini episodes. Um, but I'm just feeling overall good. It's a new It's a new era. Tim, there was an energy today that uh it's very rare to get and it was very exciting to see other people getting our hands on new hardware that uh is new but familiar, you know, and I think there there's a lot of pros there, some cons. I will say we'll get into all of that. Like you're saying, we're going to do a bunch of different uh little games cast of some of the games that we've played. Uh this episode's going",

Uh and that's also going to include the camera that we got to play with a little bit. And um what am I missing anything there? I mean the handheld mode and then just Yeah, just the Switch itself, how the screen looks and all that stuff. Yeah. Yeah, we actually we got to play a whole bunch of games. So um we'll have a lot of experience with the hardware with the hands on. Um, so I kind of just want to start off with top level impressions of holding the Switch 2 for the first time.

Like it's all the things. It's all the little tiny improvements that you want out of a Switch 2 iteration that very much feels like an iteration, not necessarily an innovation. And so that's kind of my take on it. I'm with you of like, man, an OLED would have been such a slam dunk for this thing and I think really could have made it made it pop. It still looks good, right? It still feels good and I'm expecting that in the future. But Tim, what do you think? I mean, there's a lot to to break down here in a in a very nerdy way.

Having said that, as the biggest OLED stickler in the world, I was very worried about this LCD screen. It's great. Yeah, I was saying going into this like if it's not going to be OLED, I want a PlayStation Portal equivalent screen. And in my experience so far, we're getting that. The HDR is really good. Really, really good. I got to play a lot of Mario Kart World and they're taking advantage of it. Really showing it off. Um the colors look great. The black levels are awesome. Like again, it's not OLED. And there's every time I turn my Switch OLED on, it hits me with this level of like, oh, this looks good. I wasn't getting that. Yeah. But very, very impressed.

It'll be it'll be a special treat for you in a few years. Yeah. But but even then, like, it's I of course I'm going to want that and and and need it. And maybe more experience will tell me otherwise, but so far I'm like, this is fine. This is it's more than fine. This is great. It's good. Yeah. Honestly. Yeah. Like I I think for me the thing that popped was playing Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, the Nintendo Switch 2 edition, right? Where you can see the upgrade.

I think that's where things get really more interesting. I want to jump in there. You saying it feels like a more premium switch. I don't know that I agree really because here's the problem. The screen itself, right, the OLED felt like such a premium to me here. It's like I like I everything I just said feels I'll put on the same level because it is bigger. The HDR is very very nice. 120 frames per second. Uh all of that stuff I think adds up to pros and cons, but I'll give it kind of equal in screen quality.

And I'm not just talking about the button size. Like when I clicked the trigger, the shoulder, it feels exactly like the Switch One. And that's not a compliment. Yeah. No, I I feel that. I guess that for me that was what I was expecting coming into this thing, right? Even as we're seeing the mouse functionality, I was like, \"All right, well, I guess you're going to want to feel keep the clicky nature of it because that's what you're going for here.\" But I totally agree as far as Yeah, the JoyCons feel the same.

Like feel they feel way way better, I would say. Uh face buttons slightly bigger. Like not that noticeable. Um, I will say that outside of the um, handheld mode when we're just playing with the Joy-Cons separated, uh, the the few experiences that I had doing that, I was very impressed with just the JoyCons themselves. The size of them when you're just with a single Joy-Con, it feels way better to me. Maybe it's just the size of my hand, I don't know. I liked it a lot better than the Joy-Con one. Anytime you're playing with a single one, that always felt very chintzy, very little kid, like it didn't feel right. the bigger um S and SR and SL buttons on the top of the Joy-Con also go a",

And unfortunately, I think I'm still going to be looking for third party options. Oh wow. HD Rumble 2 though, real great. Yeah, I think that's what we're talking about, right? Like the details there. Um one of the games we played was Drain Drive. Yes, Dragon. So, um I think the big thing to focus on here, let's move on to mouse mode. Yeah, brand new feature we got here, right?

I really liked how precise it feels as you're using it. We got to play Metroid Prime 4 as well, which we'll talk about another video. But that's another one where the mouse feels very precise. But playing drag and drive, right, you have that and it feels right as you're pushing yourself. If you push with one Joy-Con, you moved one way. If you push with the other Joy-Con, you move the other way, right? It's like you're moving one wheel at a time. Uh but yeah, the motion of doing it for me felt fun. I really enjoyed that.

What's another feature?\" But it really does make a difference in in experiences like this where it is, oh wow, you really are conveying the feeling of pushing a wheel forward. I am a big believer in HD Rumble. I am a big believer in the Dual Sense uh and the haptics that it has and the way that it uses its vibrations and rumbles in enhancing the overall experience. And over the years, it's been cool to see kind of innovations in that space. This Joycon 2 feels substantially better than the Joy-Con 1 in terms of the rumble.

Metroid Prime 4 is uh very seamless where it's it works the way you'd think where your left hand is now your analog and then now your right hand you're aiming with the cursor or with the mouse and we're playing in 120 frames per second and god that felt good and it was a very PC-ike experience like moving the mouse around it it was awesome. Uh there was a boss fight we did in in Metroid Prime and I I kind of tried to default to using the um or I tried to use the mouse mode majority for that and over time I found myself defaulting to using the mouse mode for boss fight which is kind of cool.

You just turn the Joy-Con and is there back and forth between using the analog and then using the mouse. Yeah. As I was doing as I was playing Metro Prime 4, I looked at the person I was demoing with and I was like, \"All right, like if I wanted to play just Joy-Cons, is there like a setting I go to?\" And he was like, \"No, just lift it up and start playing.\" And I did. I was like, \"Wow, that's a really cool transition.\" Really cool. Having said that, totally broke my brain. Broke my brain as well. And I I could not get used to switching back and forth.

Well, not the problem, but I guess the thing that you are going to have to adjust to is that you are still using buttons on the Joy-Con, at least for Metroid Prime 4 as you're playing it in mouse mode. And so, you are pressing certain buttons to jump, you're pressing certain buttons to lock on, do whatever while you're in mouse mode. So, you almost think about it as if you're on PC playing a mouse and keyboard, like if you have side buttons on your mouse essentially. And I'm not used to playing that way. And so, like that took some getting used to. And then I was like, let me try Joy-Con. And then it has like a does it have like a slightly different control scheme when you're just holding it up cuz it felt like it. I think it's just tricking us. That's the thing.

Like, I'm kind of all over the place with the mouse stuff because it's very accurate. It works really well. It worked great in Metroid Prime and I think it worked very well in a gimmicky way in uh Dragon Drive and like, hey, gameplay surrounding that. That's awesome. But it sucked using it as a mouse. Give me a mouse. I want a mouse. This feels like you're using something that's not supposed to be a mouse as a mouse. It is a Joy-Con turned sideways. Grab a Joy-Con from the Nintendo Switch One, put it on its side, and try to just move it around and like what you're clicking with. They're not a left click, right click.

I agree in the sense that it doesn't feel as good as an actual mouse, right? like using the Joy-Con makes me want to just plug in an actual mouse to my like dock and just play that way. I will say it reminds me a little bit of how it felt when I first picked up a Switch One and I started playing with the Joy-Cons and I was like, \"Oh, I don't know if this feels as good as a a Dual Shock, right, or Xbox controller.\" And then my mind gets used to it and then it just becomes second nature of like, \"Okay, no, the JoyCons feel fine.\" I could see myself getting to that point with the Joy-Cons as a mouse where I'm like, \"All right, no, but it feels fine.\" Like, now that I'm used to",

It does feel like it's not made to do this even though like they were able to make it so that it could do this. You know what I mean? Exactly. And I I do expect we might get like a specific mouse uh accessory and and if this is successful and they commit to this bit uh which I kind of feel like they're going to like this it feels well implemented.

Well, first off, I watched other people play it from a distance, and I was very impressed by just seeing how that game looks on screen. Like, it looks like Cyberpunk 2077, and that is a game that has just a lot of things going on visually when you want to talk about design and like, you know, it's in an open world, but like there's so much going on stylistically in that game. Getting my hands on it, I think the biggest compliment I can uh give it coming out of that demo is that it is perfectly recommendable. Like that is a I would play Cyberpunk 2077 this way, right?

It looks like it would I imagine on a Steam Deck, but you're not paying for a Steam Deck and a high-end PC to be able to, you know, get that full experience, right? Like you have the portable experience and the on-screen experience through the Switch 2 and it looks good enough, right? I think the one the the dings I would give it would be that uh the frame rate isn't there, right? Like it is running at pro just eyeing it, not knowing for sure. I would say like 30",

Um but when I'm standing still and I'm just looking around, I'm like, \"Oh, stuff looks this game looks great.\" And that's the thing is I I feel like we saw so many games with different variations of focusing on frame rate or focusing on resolution. And I was overall very impressed with most of them. Some I was just like, \"Oh, I I want to see this in the other mode. I want to see this like like in a in a different way than they were showing it.\" Um, but I do think that uh specifically Metroid Prime in 120 FPS with in 1080 I was like pretty blown away by and I we didn't get to see the 4K version.

I think Yeah, Yakuza Zero Director's Cut. Uh it did not uh look good. Uh the the uh person that was there was talking up like, \"Man, this might be the best way to play this game. It looks gorgeous.\" And it looks worse than the Steam Deck version of it.

Like if you're showing off like the the power of the Switch like this shouldn't be here necessarily. And I think Metroid Prime 4 is an example of like if you make a game for the Switch 2, that shit's gonna shine because that game looked fantastic on the Switch 2.

Yeah, but then you're like, you know, you're up as opposed to like, you know, trying to take Yakuza Zero and like, you know, form fit into this.

And I'm saying that from a like hardware perspective, right? Like um it just seems like it really works. There's more hardware stuff I want to get to. Um, like the Pro Controller.

I think it was an unfortunate environment because the lighting was just all over the There was a giant red light shining down on us that was definitely messing with the the camera like reading us and also Roger was filming us play and like it was kind of catching him all over the place. It was kind of chaotic, but I was kind of into it for what it was. I was into the concept cuz we did this the Mario Party Jamberee uh mode with Bowser, right?

It's like, I have no idea in actually getting this camera. But like, uh, I was very impressed with how wide the angle was and how good it was at capturing people, finding faces, and, you know, grabbing us. Um, but yeah, it was not opportune uh situation.

Um, having that extra USB slot on the top, never would have expected it would be for a camera that Nintendo is selling, but yeah. Yeah. I mean, we should probably talk price, right? 450. Not shocked by that price. Higher than I expected, but still in the realm of where I thought we we might end up. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, same. Honestly, I kept going back and forth between is it going to come out at $400? Is it going to come out at $500? I think 450 kind of hits where I did expect and based on the features we got, right?

So, when I go through and we got way better storage than we did in the previous one, we got games, we got Cyber Punk running pretty well on this thing, right? Like overall as a hardware package, I'm not mad at the price considering where we're at right now with handhelds. Getting my hands on it, seeing the screen, seeing all that. Like, I look at this and I'm like, that price seems reasonable like that. I I understand where the money's going and all of that. Um, the software side of things, that's a different conversation.

When I say pre when I said premium at the top of this, I think that was specifically the thing that really stuck out the most in terms of that feel, right? Like it felt sturdy.

That broke my brain. Like, there was a point where I was like, \"Oh, how do I get, you know, hop out to game selection or whatever?\" And they're like, \"Oh, press the L.\" I looked I was like, \"That's that's not right.
