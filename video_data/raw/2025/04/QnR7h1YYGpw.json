Of course, I am your host Tim Gettys. I'm joined today by a rare appearance on the desk by Barrett Courtney. Hold me back, Tim. Hold me back, Tim. Cuz all I want to do is turn this games cast around and turn it into a screencast cuz I want to talk about Andor so goddamn mad. We have to wait till tomorrow. We have to wait for tomorrow for Andor. Here's the deal, everybody. Andor is dropping three episodes a week uh for the next four weeks. And uh that's a lot of pages of notes, Tim. I'm excited. I'm very excited. But we're not going to be reacting uh we're not going to be doing the screencast the day after.

So to get both the Oni Musha 2 thing and even more of The Elder Scrolls Online this week is very special. I I watched that episode uh yesterday, and it's a great episode. They really go so super in depth about the highs and a lot of the lows uh and kind of a second introduction to Elder Scrolls Online with the console release. So really good stuff.

This is a game that uh we first saw last year. Game Awards, I think. So, Summer GameFest, perhaps. Summer Game Fest. I want to say it was Summer GameFest and uh we looked at it, we're like, \"Wow, that looks like incredibly ambitious.\" Uh we heard Ben Star's voice in it.

Um seeing all of the different inspirations they're pulling from, can they live up to all of that? It was the Xbox showcase during uh Summer Gamefest last year. That makes sense. Uh so yeah, that that was not that long ago. Less than a year ago, we first heard about this game. Now we have played this game. The three of you have beat this game. Correct. Correct. I have not.

I love it so much that even 10 hours in, I was like, \"Fuck this. I need to pre-order a physical copy of it.\" I want to support this team. This game is fantastic. So, uh, that is my my my very quick thoughts on it. Uh, cuz I have not beat the game yet, but I This is one of those ones that I'm like, this is for me.

I'll start. Barrett wants to start cuz I I feel like I was one of the more vocal doubters of this game. Uh especially learning how small this team was after the developer direct. Like I I I think we knew how small they were before that. But you weren't the biggest doubter though. I'll talk about it. I'll talk about it. Maybe I was justified. You know what I mean? Let's talk about it. Uh and yes, especially seeing like all of the different games that they're pulling from uh feel it wears a lot of its inspirations on its sleeve.

And it's like how is this all going to come together? And you know, I will gladly eat crow on my doubt. Uh uh what it's um fire what's the dev's team uh dev team Sandfall Interactive. This team should be incredibly proud of this first title that they've made together. This is a nine out of 10 amazing game. Um it really goes for a lot of bold swings that I think make it stand out in a lot of ways in terms of storytelling and world.

In terms of timing on making your attack stronger or uh parrying and dodging to uh completely kind of uh negate damage from enemies. A lot of that is uh very intense, but it comes together in a very satisfying way. Um I think so there are some things that I have a little gripes with that like really hold it back from being like a masterpiece uh to me, but I think for a first game from this team um for a game to come out less than a year after Metaphor Refantasio for it to stand out in so many ways with it being similar weirdly in in some ways as well.

Uh because how many times have we heard the story, right, of a small team of XAA devs that come together and they're like they're shooting above their weight class, right? They're like, \"Hey, we have all these inspirations. here's a trailer for our game. It looks amazing. It's like, okay, preview of the game feels good, but like how is the actual full game going to feel?

Uh it is uh not only a story that resonated with me. Uh I have some not gripes, but just the where we ended with the story I don't think hit as much as the journey to the ending, if that makes sense. Interesting. Uh but the gameplay blew me away. I mean, I'm with Andy, right? I'm not necessarily a turnbased person. Turn-based combat is kind of a turnoff. Uh, mostly, I mean, that was kind of a a miracle that Metaphor pushed past it with the story and everything to get me to a place where I love that game so much and made it a 10 out of 10 for me. But the way that they mix the turnbased elements of it with the parrying system, it's almost like a rhythm game.

Uh I by the ending of it, I was able to okay, well, this character does this thing. Okay, well now I'm going to play differently and adjust everything about my perks and the way that I uh uh go through a story battle and change my team up. Like I was so deep in the Duffy that I even with Metaphor, I was not like that. I was like just rolling the same characters and I was just praying to God that it would work out.

And even then, there's so much that's unique to Clare Obscure. I'm dead serious when I say please do not look up on anything story-wise before playing, which I would hammer home as well. Like the story is goes in places that I was not expecting. And like in the first 8 hours, I was like this is like a good solid thing. I'm kind of like confused on the tone of the game a little bit. I think the onboarding into the world is a little weird, but once you get to kind of like one of the first major beats, it's just all gas, no breaks from there on out.

But I really think that in almost every single one of those ways, it rises above to be its own thing. And there's something about like Andy brought up the art direction and of course the stylish uh battle system and all the UI is just super cool to look at and all of that.

In terms of also Final Fantasy, I think like one small thing is uh world navigation was one thing that kind of held me back of like this game reminded me a lot of the Final Fantasy remake games in terms of like hey here let's uh you know oh you want to get up that cliff let's have you like kind of slowly jump from like little like grab hold to little grab hold.

Uh, and that is it's funny because like I I find that charming. I don't find that bad. Like it's it's funny that like kind of even making the the jumping from climbing on mountains even simpler than an Uncharted or something like that, try to not make it look like this beautiful cinematic thing, instead making it kind of feel more classic JRPG, I feel really adds to the the novelty of this.

The only negative just here, right? because there's so much positives here. I just I just want to get it all out. The only other negative that I want to want to say is I do think this game does need some type of restart the boss fight because this game is so not just the boss fight, just fights in general. Just fights in general. Yeah, just because this game is so based on parrying like you have to learn how to precisely parry every enemy and every enemy is unique, right?

I have to restart it, go to the start from the checkpoint and walk all the way to the person and then restart and then have to deal with all their animations.\" Like, we need to get back skip through cut scenes over and over again. Stuff like that. Yeah, I think with this this is like one of the main reasons of like why I to me even though I nine out of 10 I think this is an amazing game.

I think some circumstances might change a little bit in terms of like RNG stuff and I felt myself so many times instinctually doing that in this game because yeah it it the flow of this game is very interesting and again unique uh because it feels so it feels very souls like it feels very uh action uh from soft like where a lot of your time grinding is more so learning and recognizing these new enemies that you're being introduced to in a new area.

It's literally just you're going to start up a conversation with your friends at camp and then you're going to go through just like a a conversation, not really picking a dialogue, but you can choose who you're hanging out with, who you're not hanging out with in that sense, but you're not really changing the story, I would say. Yeah, you you're picking dialogue, but I they are leading to the same place, I would say.

I was like, \"What the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is this new move?\" and having those things upgrade and get better was like, \"Oh, cool.\" At first, I definitely felt like, \"All right, well, this is definitely not as in-depth as I assume that they would want.\" Like, if they had a bunch of world, they presented in a very weird way where all of them are kind of available to do their next level all at the same time.

Because there were so many moments where we're at camp and I'm like, man, we just had a crazy story moment. Like I just got to see that through. Like I don't want to hard stop the story.

Um, getting to the rest of the super chats here, uh, before we close things out, think about if you guys have anything you want to get to. Um, we got Demon Hacker saying, \"Are the dominoes finally falling, Tim?\" Bro, they've been falling. And I feel like, again, we've said this before, Xbox bought the entire game store.

So, I feel like at the end of the day, like giving Xbox the credit of getting this game to people and their strategy and presenting the game and co-arketing, burying it with Oblivion. Horrible. That's horrible. But all of that, like, yes, the dominoes are are absolutely falling. Um, and I really quick, um, it it it only feels weird just because, you know, they were part of the developer direct in January and if they were part of a normal showcase more recently that was 30 different games and stuff like that, I I could get it.

You know, y'all who are watching this are probably going to eventually play both. Uh, but I'm I think more about the conversations for, you know, my friends who are kind of in between normies and us, right, who are texting me all about Oblivion yesterday. I don't know like unless I tell them specifically, I don't know if they're going to naturally find out about Expedition because of this thing. So it it's that it feels so emblematic uh emblement emblematic emblematic of the uh industry for an indie studio to come out with such a unique fun new thing uh this week only",

And so that's the that's the frustrating thing. Play Expedition 33. I mean, that's the takeaway. Again, a $50 game or on Game Pass. Like, how the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is this game $50? How? Yeah, like that. I'm I How did 30 people make this [\u00a0__\u00a0] Why didn't they have 33 employees? Like, come on, guys. Come on. Um, but I I do hope that, you know, throughout the rest of the year that this that hype will kind of circle back around because I I mean, even now it reminds me a lot of metaphor last year where you see that big ass graphic on social media with all the nines and tens all over the place and I I think word of mouth",

Yeah. 100. I think people will boot up Oblivion and be like, \"Oh, it is an old game.\" Like, it does feel old like an old game. Not that's not hating on it, but you know, Exhibition is a is a brand new video game. And and I know that like, you know, people like, \"Ah, they're different enough and all this stuff.\" And even Mike said yesterday, the game's good, people flock to the game. I hope that for this game, you know, there are also situations like Titanfall 2. So, like I just again, it's too early to really say, but also Doom comes out next month, too.
