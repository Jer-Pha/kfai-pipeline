Just real quick, I want to say uh we have deep dive conversations that you can listen to right now about Metroid Prime 4 Beyond, Mario Kart World, all of the Nintendo Gamecube games we got to play, which includes Mario, Super Mario Strikers, uh Zelda Wind Waker, um Soulcalibur 2, Soulcalibur 2, and F-ZeroGX, and um our impressions of the hardware overall, like getting to to hold it, play it in mouse mode, uh the Pro Controller, everything, the the screen quality, all of that stuff.

Tim, talk to me about the planning and the hurdles to the normal content that were placed in front of us and how you guys overcame. Yeah, to try to say this uh briefly because like there's there's many elements to it. Um, we went to the me, Roger, and Bless went to New York to get hands-on with the Nintendo Switch 2. That meant we, uh, had to watch the Nintendo Direct in at the event venue because we got to play immediately after, uh, the Direct ended. So, uh, we were not able to do our traditional direct reactions. Um, and even though we tried, I I pitched them, what if we just did it at the hotel? Uh, and then came later.

And then I literally begged them to allow us to do that and they said sorry no. Uh but I I want it clear. I literally begged them. I said please in all caps let us do this. It's more than that. Uh and but I mean in a professional email, you know what I mean? Like I actually did that. And uh they did not let us do that. So, and on top of that, they weren't they they were this is the most secretive event that I've ever been a part of uh when it comes to video games.

So, very secretive. You you keep saying you're in the room. Was it a a hotel ballroom? What was it? An actual theater. Where did you watch the direct?

Yeah, you get and and the third biggest one uh was when they announced that welcome tour was a paid uh that was People laugh awkward. People laughed in the in this in the area. It was great.

Maybe this might have just been a me thing was Donkey Kong Bonanza, just out of the pure unbelief, the disbelief that there was another 3D Donkey Kong game that was being announced and released.

Uh, and I I think the best example for y'all to understand, cuz I feel like the majority of our audience was there for the Switch One generation, um, the Switch One Direct had Mario Kart, had Mario Odyssey, all that.

So, we start off and you play is Mario Kart World.

There was like a a selection process of what like Grand Prix or course you want to do.

Like I feel like at any moment we could have played any game we wanted uh towards the end of the day which was very nice and that meant I got to go back and play a insane amount of Mario Kart which was awesome and I I played the Metroid demo again. Uh it was awesome. It was it was very very cool that we got that much experience with it. Yeah. But now tell me about it. You walk into a room you have permission to play Donkey Kong. Yeah.

Uh, so I do that and like play through the demo again. Check out the games cast where we talked deeper about it. But I was delighted by by the time I finished my gameplay with this, right? It is the idea of you are uh you are playing as Donkey Kong. Donkey Kong is a hulk of a beast, right?

Uh, but then you we got to a section that has like more concrete surfaces and tougher surfaces. And like as at one point during my demo, there's like an enemy that's flying in the air. And if you press a certain button as Donkey Kong, you can pick up a rock out of the ground and throw it at an enemy. And I press the button and he doesn't do it. And then the enemy kills me. And I looked at my the person that was demoing with me and I was like, \"What was the button to pick it up? Am I am I doing something wrong?\" Uh, and he was like, \"Oh yeah, it's this.\" He's And then he he realizes he's like, \"Oh, you were standing on a more tough surface, so you have to",

And so to explode that, I had to find an explosive piece uh an explosive surface to then pull and then throw at him. Uh and so like the destruction stuff and like the surface stuff is like a very heavy element of the game. Uh which I think is really cool.

Um uh with with Luigi's Mansion going all the way with the the sucking and blowing. It is what it is. It does. Um and this is very much with the the different levels of the the how solid the surfaces are and how you can interact with all of them. But there's also an element of Tears of the Kingdom and uh Breath of the Wild. Not just in terms of like you can climb everything and all of that, but also in terms of how destructible everything is and how the physics play with each other.

And it's kind of like this cool mixing like physics with the the different elements. And you know, Nintendo's been playing with that stuff a lot, mainly in the Zelda games. But I I think that uh what we're getting from Bonanza here is kind of a nice melding of a lot of what Nintendo has learned from across their different games and using it to kind of be a celebration of Donkey Kong throughout the ages of the different generations we've seen of Donkey Kong. both his look being more styled after the original, but then also in the direct we saw more Donkey Kong Country 2D inspired levels, but then also this and the O banana and Donkey Kong 64 elements, but",

I see it in those ways of that we're taking a character that we know that people know and love and finding a very specific lane for them to exist in and not even finding inventing a lane for them to exist in that hopefully can be innovative and fun enough to where we can make a Bonanza 2 or we can like you know continue on with with this trajectory for DK to like have",

It feels very kind of house Nintendo at this point where this music doesn't seem to have its own identity. It seems like if you kind of mix the Mario Kart stuff with Mario Odyssey with Donkey Kong like music, but it's all just very like this is what it sounds like and what it sounds like is very high quality. So, it's not a complaint but it's not unique and it's not David Wise and it's not Grant Kirkop and we know that and that to me I'm like we don't know who it is but that's not Donkey Kong. But then this is my thing, right?

That said, right, this is a Nintendo 3D Donkey Kong. This is not a rare 3D Donkey Kong, right? So, like I honestly, even though even though I love Grant Kerob's music and I love David Weise's music, those are some of the best soundtracks of all time, I think it works. And I'm actually happy that you don't have them coming back for this game because I think that sets expectations to a different place of what this thing is trying to be.
