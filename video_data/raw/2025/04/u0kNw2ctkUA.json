We'll have all this and more because this is kind of funny games daily. [Music] What's up and welcome to kind of funny games daily for Friday, April 4th, 2025. Of course, I'm your host Tim Gettys and I'm joined by Blessing Adoay Jr. Good day, Tim. Good day to you, too. It's good to be back at the desk in San Francisco. Oh my goodness. Good week, I should say. What a week. Oh my god. Bad week in some ways, but good mostly, I would say. Yeah, it's it's rough. Obviously, there's a lot of bad. We're going to talk about a lot of that. Uh, but a lot of good and I will just say like a lot of good in terms of friendship, in terms of companionship and fun. Me, you, and Raj in New York had a great time.

And I want to address something at the top of the show real quick. I don't want to go too deep or too long. Uh, but just a couple things because now officially we can embargos are up. We can say whatever we want to say about this stuff. Obviously, I wanted to be here for the live reaction to uh the Nintendo Direct 2. I tried my best to make that happen. When I found out the times were overlapping, I was very upset. Upset to the point that I was like, \"Hey, can we not be there in the inerson thing and can we just record our reactions in a hotel?\" And they were like, \"No, you have to be there.\" And then I was like, \"Okay, but can I record my",

It is very important to me.\" And they said, \"Sorry.\" So, I just want to let you all know I fought the fight. I care more than you do, but I really, really, really appreciate that so many of you care. I am sorry that you were let down in any way. Um, but we did the what we think is the right call.

Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5th, 2025 is unchanged. The delay marks one of the most significant immediate responses from a major company regarding their concerns about President Trump's tariffs and their impact on business and consumer spending.

Their prices are going to balloon.\" Yeah. But the fact is that people will always need smartphones, right? And like maybe you aren't getting the high-end smartphone, maybe you're getting the mid-end smartphone, but I think on the software side, if you're a game developer, you might have to start making that your target because a lot of people are going to own those.

It lived up to all of the hype over the last couple years. So, here's season here's hoping for season two, baby. Moving on to story number three. Bungie's Marathon finally emerges from the shadows to tease something. This comes from Wesley and Ianpool at IGN. Remember Marathon? It's Destiny developer Bungie's next game, and it looks like we're finally about to see more about it. Marathon is a PvP focused extraction shooter set on the mysterious planet of Tao Seti 4. Uh players inhabit the bodies of runners, cybernetic mercenaries who have been designed to survive the planet's harsh environments, exploring the lost colony that once inhabited the planet's surface. It's been quite a while since we've heard of Marathon. In October,",

In October, Bungie released a lengthy development update video that shed light on Marathon's mechanics, but stressed how early in development the game was. Player character models were at that point still coming together, while enemy models were still in early state. Now though, half a year later, it looks like Bungie's finally ready to reveal what they've been working on. A tweet from the official Marathon account revealed a typically cry cryptic image and accompanying garbled signal noise. As fans have noticed, there is some as I don't know how to say this. ASCI asi, you know, I've read it a million times. You know what the hell it is. Um, all right. A footage from the debut marathon trailer. Given this is Bungie.

And fans are already working to find out what it all means. Either way, it very much looks like it's finally happening for Marathon after what's been a troubled development. Everybody in chat is saying asky asky. I would have never never thought that. Asky. You know, you're right though. I believe you. Everybody. I believe. Um it was nice to see like Marathon take over not just the Marathon page, but then like uh I believe the PlayStation uh p like the official PlayStation uh accounts also changed their banners and like uh the PlayStation blog as well.

And so like I'm very fascinated to see whatever this is it once we get a trailer or a drop or whatever like is it going to move people? Is it going to turn people?

You know, like even as going as far as saying it's a good game. It's a fun game. And then it came out into a world that wasn't it just looking for that. Wasn't looking for it.

And so I think next week is going to be that moment for Marathon potentially if GR is right where we're going to get that first look. I think the way they present this game is going to be incredibly important because we all look back at Concord and what they should have done. We said it a million times. We've now talked to people uh behind the scenes on this. Like they should have done something more similar to what Apex Legends did of let people play the game and let that lead the conversation.

If you want to hear our thoughts on it, stay tuned to the Games Cast. Uh, Donkey Kong Bonanza is 10 gigs. Uh, GameCube Nintendo Classics are 3.5 gigs. Super Mario Party Jamberee is 7.7. On the Switch One, it was 5.3. Uh, but that makes sense because there's a lot of new content that we got to see. Dude, you you know that there was a whole bunch of other Mario Party stuff that we could have played and we didn't. Really? I was watching a bunch of like IGN videos. I'm like, \"Oh, man. Yeah, we could have played a bunch of mouse mode stuff.\" That's so [\u00a0__\u00a0] funny. We missed out. Um, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is 5.7 on the Switch 2. Wa. It's 5.8 on the Switch one.

I've been seeing it everywhere. This [\u00a0__\u00a0] is going to be big. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know what Enzoy is? I don't. Oh my god.

Um, Nin Nin says, \"Can someone help get the ad version of grading the Nintendo Switch to Direct Games Cast on Spotify? Appreciate all the Switch 2 coverage this week.\" Um, I'll have to look into that. Um, Phil Silva says, \"Bless, how does it feel to know you started the Stars in the Bank Madness?\" FYI, my shirt is ordered. Tim, I don't know if I should thank you. We're still selling the shirts. It's past April 2nd. The date doesn't [\u00a0__\u00a0] matter. The date was really like the beginning. Everything before that date was just preamble, y'all. The tour has begun.

Everyone has known they'd be coming, and despite that, they announced the price. They could have said, \"We will not be announcing the price at this moment,\" but they did not. It is very interesting that they did that. My theory on it is that 450 is the price that they wanted it to be. So getting it out there now, it's like then if if things get horrible and it has to be $800, Nintendo will be able to be like, \"We wanted it to be this, but now it has to be this.\" You know what I mean? Yeah. Cuz 450 is an entirely reasonable price for the system. And in my opinion, anybody that is uh it doesn't seem like people are upset about it doesn't seem like rational people are upset about the price of the console. The price of the games is [\u00a0__\u00a0] obnoxious and like that is a problem. An $80 Mario Kart. What the [\u00a0__\u00a0] are",

You know what I mean? Yeah. Uh, New Matteo says, \"For love that's all that all that is holy, call your senators.\" Um, Golden Spider says, \"So, I really doubt Nintendo will be raising the price.\" Responding to what he already said. We'll see. Um, Diddley says, \"Vietnam told Trump they want to do 0% tariff with the United States of America.\" Uh, new Matteo says when he sells pardons for 2 million a pop, it's one thing, but going after Switch 2 is too far.

Game Pass isn't a way to make money. Like it's not going to help the industry. It's only going to hurt themselves. Yeah. I know a girl that looks exactly like this. I That's amazing.
