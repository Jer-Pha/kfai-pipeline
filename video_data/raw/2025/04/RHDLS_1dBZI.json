Prototype builds for several canceled games, including a Nintendo Switch Ridgeraer title, Lego Civilization, and an unannounced game from Retro Studios have allegedly appeared online. Footage of the canceled Ridge Ridger Racer game, which is allegedly from a build from 2017, is currently circulating on social media. The game was reportedly developed by Bandai Namco Studios Singapore and was intended for the Nintendo Switch. The game was never announced and has presumably been long since cancelled. Further development footage of a game prototype developed by Retro Studios titled Harmony has also appeared online. The footage shows a third person perspective of a fairy character that can transform into different characters to solve puzzles. The build is claimed to be from 2017. However, the game itself was never announced by",

However, the game itself was never announced by Retro. The unannounced game had previously been referenced by Reese Kiwi Talks Riley, a content creator who has interviewed several former Retro Studios employees. Earlier this year, Riley mentioned on Reset Era that he'd been told the project was a huge disaster and that the game was canceled after years of going nowhere. It is believed that this footage has been obtained via a Nintendo Switch development kit that was sold online. Dev kits are provided to developers by platform holders and are often heavily modified versions of retail consoles that can run in development builds. These kits can often retain information and playable builds for games long after they are cancelled and thus it is against the terms of service with platform holders uh that provided the dev kit to sell to sell them",

A menu screen for Lego Civilization which as it sounds appears to be a Lego take on the classic strategy game was also found on the dev kit. Those with access to these files claim they have attempted to run the Lego Civilization title, but have reported that it will instantly crash when attempting to play it. Uh, dev builds of both Splatoon 2, ARMS, and Rhyme are also said to have been found on the dev kit. Gary, a lot here, but to whittle it down, games have leaked, right?

While the system won't have consolewide achievements, uh, two Nintendo Switch 2 edition games will have their own achievement list, though they will be relegated to a mobile app. Zelda Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild will both get Switch to Editions, as well as a new app, Zelda Notes, which will be part of the Nintendo app. Gary, a Nintendo achievement system not appearing on Switch 2.

Uh, I'm glad to see Nintendo as usual saying like we don't feel the need to jump onto the same bandwagon as everyone else, right? Xbox introduced this this concept, right? Sony then copied it with trophies. Steam copied it with their achievements. And many many games now have their own inbuilt achievement systems, right? Um it's funny. It's interesting. I thought a lot about this because I actually sat a couple of years ago game developers conference. I sat not sorry at at DICE. Um uh I sat on a round table of other game developers and people that are into this kind of [\u00a0__\u00a0] talking about achievements. Are they good? Are they bad? Are they a net? Are they a net",

I have played games where I really wanted to get the achievements because they were they were they were structured and designed in an interesting way. But a lot of achievements are not welld designigned. They just and they just amount to kind of busy work. It's like I don't anytime you're going like I don't really want to be doing this but I want the trophy or I want the achievement. You failed, right? It should add to the fun, not just like become another [\u00a0__\u00a0] grind, right? And so there are good ways to implement achievements and bad ways to implement achievements.

This is this is where I stand is that not every game needs achievements. I think some games could use them in the way that we're talking about when they're designed around it. A game like Spider-Man for example. Spider-Man is so good about its achievements. the back. So that's one of the only two games I've ever platinum and then you're finding all the backpacks. Yeah, I actually enjoyed doing that cuz it was well designed. There were a couple that drive me crazy. Oh, sorry. Three games I've I've done. And I'll tell you this, even as much as I liked doing the achievements, there was at least one in each one where I'm like, [\u00a0__\u00a0] this achievement.

Well, and that's my thing with Nintendo is that I think Nintendo games, quite a few of them, I think could benefit from a like I think a Mario game is probably like good. You're going down a rabbit hole now. No. I think a Mario games typically I think are good contenders for it. But at the same time, Nintendo is so much about play and so much about like your own experience with it, but you don't need achievements to come through and be like, \"Okay, now I have this additional thing to chase.\" Here's the thing.

My sense is that Nintendo, which again I have a lovehate relationship with Nintendo, they give away, they give with one hand and take away with the other. And I love them one minute, I'm pulling my hair out the next. One thing that I do think Nintendo cares about and is very good at is preserving the integrity of like the core gameplay experience, right? That's why the games are so [\u00a0__\u00a0] good, right?

They've got to be built into the like for example Corox right in the Zelda games that is something like collect every Cororox you can see get an achievement for that Nintendo doesn't do that they they reward you in a better way right you collect those Cororox seeds and you can trade them in to get an extra heart so it's actually something that rewards you in a tangible way in the core gameplay experience not just here's 10 extra points that don't mean anything here's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] NFT virtual trophy gives a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about that and I",

Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom, and Breath of the Wild are getting them through the Nintendo app. Uh, and I think that's cool because I can see that that's kind of sideloaded into the experience, right? That's not actually in the game. It's a bit siloed and also but I but also that's that's a decision that they made. For some reason, they looked at Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom specifically and went, \"Oh, we can add some kind of achievement achievement thing here.\" My one, it's not even a problem, but I guess my one thing to elevate it would be the thing that I do like about PlayStation and Xbox achievement systems is that there's more",

I can see on like whatever feed that I'm looking at that, oh, my friend just earned this achievement, right? My friend just earned this trophy. I would love that for Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom here. You know what the answer uh Nintendo has for that bless? What's that? Game chat. You just uh you know hit up to a chat with your friend and then they can stream to you. Well, this is this is the reason why I say it is like Nintendo is pushing social features really hard with Nintendo Switch 2. They introduce Game Chat. They have a [\u00a0__\u00a0] camera that you can buy and that I'm sure people aren't going to use infarious ways. Listen, I used to play Uno on the Xbox 360.",

I The amount of people that are going to pull their wiener out playing before you get into Uno, there's gonna be a different kind of jamberee going on, Gary. But here's the thing, right? is that Nintendo was pushing the the social features really hard. And I don't think that stuff is going to be as I guess elevated by the audience as it could be without something like an achieve like a passive achievement system. I think you need passive like social features. You need a feed. You need something to where I am looking at my friends list and going, \"Oh, I have a reason to add you even though I'm not going to play this game with you.

If you're going fully on with social features, I think you need a social feed as well. And I think that includes achievements for certain games. Not all games, but for certain games. I heard some of what you just said. Yeah. But not all of it. Because in truth, a big part of my mental band of it for the last 30 seconds was thinking how is because again I I I played Uno on the Xbox 360 with the vision camera and and there's a Oh, dude.

It's pointing at you.\" And Bowser's like, \"All right, move as much as you can.\" Like, the more movement and noise you're making, the higher the meter goes. Right.
