And I was like, \"Okay.\" And I open it up and it's weird because when I order an Amazon thing, it says the Millers. That's the account I use or whatever. I open it up and inside is a football and a pump. You know what I mean? A very nice football. And I there's no no gift, no note, no whatever. And so I was like, \"Oh, well, I know my mom sent something the other day. Maybe she was sending multiple things or whatever.\" So I bust it out. I'm like, \"Ben, you got a football.\" And I inflated and he's all excited. Then, \"Okay, don't throw it in the house.\" You know what I mean? We can take it outside. We can do stuff with it. He's so excited. Thank you. Thank you. I'm like, \"No problem.\" I come home the next day. It's March 14th. And another Amazon package out front to Greg Miller. That's weird.

Is there another football on the football?\" I was going to go a week straight, but you came in that day and talked to me about it, and I was like, \"All right, this is fine. It's getting expensive.\" They were like 10 bucks, but after a certain point, like, how many times we got to do this? Yeah. Yeah. How many footballs are we? Yeah.
