Uh, I'm not personally excited for Borderlands, but got to give them kudos for keeping their formula and not making it yet another Extraction shooter out of it. I love it. I mean, we might have a mode. You never know. Borderland Extraction is not coming anywhere near Borderlands. That would kill the whole franchise. Uh Joey, clip it out. Get ready. Clip it out. Get ready. Joey Radzone says, \"Ideas for Switch 2 fall game releases. Splatoon Splatoon 4. What you see is what you're going to get.\" Metroid Prime 4 is the big fall release.

So maybe they do another direct two weeks, four weeks after the Switch launch. Yeah. And then it's like, hey, here's the rest of our year with the big thing being Metroid Prime 4 October, November. I think your fall games are going to be Kirby, Pokemon, Metroid Prime 4, the games that we already know of. I don't think there's going to be any bigger games announced for the rest of this year. Yeah, that's what I meant. Kirby riders. Yeah. Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. Um, Vulk Dasher says, \"Sony and Take 2 are very close.\" So, no, so non-surprise if Marathon is involved in GTA 6 marketing.

Like Champagne, Illinois would get so cold that it wouldn't even be snowing. It would just be a cold day. It Yeah. I mean, they'll call it a snow day, but it's like, hey, temperatures are so low. You should not be outside that if kids go outside, they will die. That sucks. Yeah. And so there's other things to worry about when it's that cold.
