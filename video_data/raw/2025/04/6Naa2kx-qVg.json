Of course, I'm your host Tim Gettys and I'm joined today by the master of the grid, Snow Bike. Mike, Tim, I'm the I'm the grid master, Tim. You're done with the grid forever. How does that feel? It hurts a little bit, you know, like when you master the grid and you start teleporting people to different sides to then add on to their abilities, right? Like, let me tell you what, Tim. Okay, you put that double cast on my girl Lulu. Or, oh snap, you bring Yuna over there to get the double cast, too. Watch out. But the double cast only works for dark spells. So, that was pretty messed up cuz my girl, she'd be healing a lot until Oh, yeah. until until we got you got to use zombie all the time for that Z Jack Z stuff, right? Oh my gosh. Zombie. Holy, right. Is that the final one that we needed? Holy. Holy dominant, Tim. And so I mastered the grid. I was exploring the grid. I got lost on the",

There was moments where I was like, I'm adding up numbers and I'm like, okay, Lulu needs six more levels to get double cast, which then would put her here, but then I need her up here. Okay, Yuna needs to come over to here, but she's behind and I need her desperately to get holy before I go to there. And then I'm adding it all up and I'm like, I need 20 levels, but I'm at the end of the game. I'm not going to grind, right? Because like I'm dominating. And so I'm having this back and forth and I'm like, oh snap, I'm going to grind. Then I played 5 hours of side content, so I did grind. Tim, I'm all over the place.

I was so frustrated dying, dying, dying, having to watch that cut scene. It was, you know, great music, all that, but frustrating after a certain point. And I was like, you know what? I'm going to go back out, get as many of the legendary weapons as I can, grind as much as I possibly can. And I remember for hours grinding on top of of sin. Uh, and what's so funny, Mike, is I remember I was playing, this is back in the [\u00a0__\u00a0] day on a CRT TV, all right? Like there was no widescreen in sight at this point. And uh I'm playing like 3 ft away from my TV cuz the PS2 cord wasn't that long.

No. The funny thing is, by the way, um only bought it because my friends were there uh by and they're all buying. They're big Lululemon guys. They were buying stuff and I saw them. Oh, I like the color. I like the the kind of cut of it cuz if you notice, it like has these like little arm lines on it. I don't know. Like the vibes of it. I was like, \"Fuck it. I'll get it.\" And they were all like, \"Dude, it's cheaper here because it's Canada.

So, I'm happy that the whole crew is back. Greg's back after his fantastic little trip to Chicago. Great meet and greet as well. And uh Tim, you know, we're going to talk about Final Fantasy 10. Yes, we are.

I took a chance on Final Fantasy 10 because it was on sale for $9. Then I kick on Steam this week. They're having a sale to go to go hand in hand with the anime, of course.

And, uh, I kicked it on last night and wow, Devil May Cry 3 is a banger. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. And a lot of people are going to be like, \"Oh, why'd you start with three, Mike? You got to start.\" And like the thing is, you got to know Mike. Three is the one that is, I think, the earliest that's the most playable today. Yeah. One, I love the setting the most. I think that the the story of it is very interesting and intriguing, but the sheer fun of Dante and three, it being a prequel, I'm usually a release sort of guy through and through, but for Snowike Mike, starting with three is absolutely the right call.

Halfife 2 disappointed me. We'll talk about that another time. Yeah. Maybe it was the time away. Uh it was the non-stop. It was You know what it really was, Tim? It was the non-stop action. Halflife 2 has an incredible opening. It goes from zero to 100 real quick. They add in some really cool stuff with the the grav gun. They add vehicles. Raven Home is awesome. Don't get me wrong. I love that little horror scene of it all. But after that, it's just like non-stop cranked up to 11.

The topic of the shows, Tim, let's pick up where we left off because here I was talking about how much I loved this game. I talked about some of the things I didn't love. You know, not being able to skip cut scenes is tough. You know, some outrageous camera angles on certain characters. Some outrageous camera angles that I'll never forget now. You know what I mean?

Dude, Lulu's little uh her like what is the rest motion where she's just kind of like, we don't need all of that. We finish every single fight with Lulu and she's just giving you a little bit of a bump on that. You're like, all right. But like really what it came down to is I fell in love with this game. And through and through as I talk about it, I am still in love with this game. I finished the game. It it hit me emotionally. I didn't think it would. It it changed something inside of me, Tim. And that makes me so happy to hear. Uh because, you know, I I I love the things I love wholeheartedly with with every ounce of my being. And uh uh people often are like, \"Oh, Tim Tim's so",

You know what I'm saying? And Mike, I feel like me and you relate on that. And I knew that this end was going to wreck you. And uh it did. And being able to see that was so special to me. Like I I I highly recommend all of you watch the VODs of Mike's Journey cuz like seeing him experience this stuff has been amazing. But the last hour of this game, watching you you play through it, realizing all the big reveals and what you you're being asked to do. Yeah. you know, and having to deal with it all.

Of course, we stopped the wedding last time on the last episode we talked about and you said, \"No, no, Seymour. I'm not doing that.\" And took a jump, a leap of faith. And I thought to myself, there's no way we can climb much higher than that. I know the sacrifice now. I know that she's going to have to give up herself for that final AON. Tim, I'm so wrong because it was a lot more game left and there was a lot more twists and turns that I wasn't ready for. So, let's pick up where I left you because we were in Bevel and we did stop a wedding and then after that we went down to go check on Yuna because she made the giant jump which leads us into the Bevel Temple which is the moving walkway of hell.

Tim, that is nut to get on the moving walkway, watch the green arrows go right, left, center, forward, and you're panicking trying to get them. Then you're going down a level, up a level, you fall off a level, then they bring you back up to the beginning. You are so lost. in this YouTube video and watch them difficult.

And of course, we got the reveal of Yuna speaking with the little ghost child. As I talked about before, I said, \"Who's this little ghost child? Why is he following me around? What's his deal?\" And we found out that he speaks and he was telling you the details of what these Aons really are, right? And I thought, \"Oh, snap. I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know that they were giving themselves up to become these incredible AOS.\" And that's where we get the goat.

And then of course Seymour comes right afterwards and he's like, \"You're going to jail, homie. I'm taking over.\" And Tim, that's when you get the mega reveal. We go to trial. Okay. We have a master Ronzo. We have Master Micah. We have Seymour. And we learn about Spir the Spiral. Okay, Tim. And what a reveal of I already have been to the Far Plains.

How do I need to make sure that I'm on this turn chart more than you are? How do I need to make sure that we do X, Y, and Z before you even get a turn? Because trust me, there's a man who I'm gonna meet later on in this playth through. And it's all about getting your turns in beforehand cuz he's going to dominate you. Daddy, I'm sorry.

So, how you start, of course, is she wants to teach you how to ride a Chocoo. Be your first time really kind of riding a Chocoo since the beginning of the game. You've kind of gone away from the choke. Well, technically all the Chocoos almost went extinct when Sin wiped out the entire Chocoo population. So, I did forget about that, just so you know. And so, it's your first time riding a Choke Bowl in quite some time. She says, \"Hey, I'll let you ride my Chocoo, but you have to complete the trainings.\" And so, the first one is like, \"Run forward, dodge these balls, and you're kind of running back and forth in this like grid-like area.\" Then the ending is like, \"You have to race me, and it's going to be pure luck because the",

So sometimes she'll beat you to the first six balloons, which means you're now down like 20 seconds to her and then the balloons will then go into this insane open field where seagulls will come three to six at a time. And they are almost impossible to dodge. It is an insane idea to try to dodge with the D-pad. The Chocoo will rip you whichever way it wants. And then the of course of course the course it's PS2 so there's a bunch of invisible walls and the course isn't quite laid out right where you're like I should be able to get this balloon but the Chocoo says no that's an invisible wall and goes the wrong way.

And I battled this lady. It took me about 20 tri 20 tries and I finally did it. So again, this has been it's been 20 years since I played through this game. Oh man, look at this. Dude, the seagulls though, like you mentioned, I forgot about those guys. But where where are the Eagles are going to come right now? Get ready. Here they come. And so you drop this. Yeah, dude.

So, uh I I forgot a lot of this. So, remind me about where I'm wrong here. In the game, your squad's max HP and max damage is 9,999, right? But then when you get the get the ultimate weapon and that unlocks it, then you can do n What was it? 9999,000. up. Take it out. Unlimit unlimited. You can limit break it. Is right, Tim.

I got Tetus and I got Yuna, which Yuna will be massive for me with Holi, right? Hol 9,000 damage is a big shift there. If I didn't have that, I probably might I would have had a lot more trouble with this video game. And so I worked my ass off to get both of them. And of course in the commlands, it's this beautiful giant piece of earth that is just empty and barren. And so once you unlock the chocobo, you can ride around. And so underneath there's a little hidden spot. Up above there's a hidden spot. And then there's a cave where you go and see a man who turns this video game into Pokemon.

Oh my god, what a you have to buy weapons from him that aren't your weapons that have the special stats on them. This one just has the capture stat that you of course want. And so now you have to plan out who's on the team, who has the weapons, who's putting the final hit on them.

The ultimate one-two punch, and then you blow up on the top side. That move saved me so many times. It was so cool, Tim. So you have Andy Ma. Yeah. So there's Andy M. Then there's um the Magga sisters, the three bugs, the splash sisters as I call them. Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and of course the distant cousin, Boogie Cousins. Those three girls are going to be coming in a lot cuz they saved me through this playthrough when they go to praise the triangle on their ultimate move and we just put whatever monster in the middle",

It's like keep doing what you're doing. help your friends attack or do whatever you want to do. And so like it's very cool. The big ladybug will heal but can do damage. You have the lady in the middle which will summon the fire talons as the praying mantis. She'll put a reflect on her teammates or the wasp one which will lightning bolt onto them or they'll shoot the little, you know, little butt uh pellets which is super fun.

And like they have a moment where they talk to each other, she apologizes, and she's like, it's time to move on. And I was like, oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] this is awesome. Yeah.

The the the bug sisters, I don't think they have like an insane story, but like this one was cool of like I get that and I'm like, \"Oh my god, are you telling me all these secret aons will have like incredible stories about that?\" Cuz like getting more Lulu lore is crazy. Chapoo and her her trying to move on like what's next for me, right? And then of course, yeah, finding out that she's been on one before. She had a high summoner and they failed.

I wonder what Mike did. There was a moment in my game where I needed him to get me past somebody and I I gave him $126,000. I said, \"Do it.\" And he bust open that sword and it's on. Because if not, you get the dog that does a little uppercut. You get him to throw out the little knives or you get the blade and it's like the blade is so sick.

So Tim, get ready for an epic moment cuz we arrive at the, you know, the summit, but it's not the top of Mount Gagazette. And we are met by the Ronzos. And we finally get the moment. We get the backstory for Kamari because we know that there was two Ronzos way back at Kilica Islands who were checking on our Ronzo. They were teasing him. They were uppercutting him. And he held his ground. He knew better. And sure as [\u00a0__\u00a0] we arrived at Mount Gagazette, home of the Ronzos, and they said, \"Halt, we're gonna have a conversation.\" And Yuna told the high priest there, she's like, \"We have to do this.\"",

I'm going to complete the ultimate sacrifice and we're going to do this.\" And they go back and forth and he says, \"Fine, let him through.\" And that is where Kamari faces his two bullies. And we learn what happened to Kamari because those two bullies broke his horn back in the day and kicked him off the mountaintop. And that's where he meets Aurin. He also meets Lord Brasa.

Save all these story reveals and it's like, \"Oh man, you're making even the guy I don't care about hit hard.\" The best story about Kamari is right, Tim. And so you learn so much about him. He goes on the two-on-one fight against these two. And the coolest part about Kamari is he has that absorb power. So you're always doing the Lancelot absorb power to try to learn new moves. These two Ronzos are teaching you new moves, but they're bullying you because one will run through you, but it's a one-on-one fight. Nobody else is involved in this. He's got to stand up for himself.

They're done. Extinct. I have wiped them out and we're going to fight one more time cuz I cannot let you get to the final summon. I want to be Sin. And you're like, Seymour, you don't got to be sin.

Because to you, Zanukkin is this like technologically advanced land. Like this is where the game started, the Blitz Ball Arena, like all this stuff. And then you see the ruins. The ruins, Tim. And we find out that Xanarchind is just a dream. All of these people have been putting forth the faith to create this dream world. And that's when it's you start doing this. Oh my god, what?
