Thanks for having me on uh Kind of Funny Games Daily. Nice to uh join you and talk some game news. Yeah, I'm I'm doing pretty good today, Mike, because CJ Splicit in chat says, \"Who has Bionic Bay on Fantasy Critic from KF?\" And I'm happy to report that I have Bionic Bay in my Fantasy Critic. If you didn't think Blessing didn't have that, one step ahead of you. Now, what is Bionic Babe? Bionic Bay. B A Y. That's why you were asking me about boobies before this.

Uh, a scientist uses a unique teleportation instrument to escape an ancient biochemical world filled with imaginative technology, deadly traps, and hidden secrets. That's a terrible description for this one. Yeah, I have no idea what that is. It's a 2D puzzle platformer. Think like uh um Limbo. Think like inside, but the art style is pixel art, but still maintains that same atmosphere that you that you expect from a puzzle platformer like a Limbo. Okay.

This looks different.\" Like I I've dropped a link in assets if you want to uh bring up the Steam page and like play some footage cuz like this is one where if you're a fan of the games that I mentioned, you should keep your eye on this. One of the main gimmicks that I've encountered early on, which might just be the main gimmick of the game, is that you can like tap objects within the world and um change positions with that object.

Oh, it's really cool. And look at the art style. Like this is what I'm talking about right here. This is a blessing ass video game right here. Blessing. This is a blessing ass video game if I've ever heard. The thing that sucks is that I'm playing another blessing ass video game, Blueprints, and it's taking up all my time. Is that game so good? It's unbelievable. I like every time. We haven't really caught up on it. Have you beat it? No. Have you beat it? Yeah. Like that's the catch. I'm not even real credit.

And I loved chopping wood, but I liked their use of magic that they got going on here. I like the small tweaks and elevation to combat. Uh, of course, you know me, I love building a good little farmstead home and getting lost in it. Uh, I'm going to siege a castle tomorrow or tonight. Um, there's a dragon that I'm definitely going to take out of the skies here. Me and Maddock did um one of the dungeons and I really liked the little 3D platforming puzzles they got going on here.

Uh Mike, what is your hype level for Mario Kart World? This direct happening tomorrow. Yeah, bless. I'm kind of a mixed bag of emotions cuz I did feel like I saw plenty and learned plenty from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct that we just got last week, right? Or the week before. So, I feel like I'm I I'm all good on this, but I definitely understand, right? This is the call to action. This is the reminder of like, hey, get your pre-orders in. Get excited to purchase a new Mario Kart. And so, when I think of it that way, I'm probably at like a good seven out of 10. Can people get their pre-orders in? Well, I you know the question will be after this Barrett. Is this a time when Nintendo now has something at the end to say, \"Hey, prepare for",

Because this is another big call to action, right? All eyes on Nintendo. Come tune in. We're all going to still have the same question. When are pre-orders? Do they answer it here? Is that the right time or place? I I don't know. But this is a moment where they could very much say, \"Hey, you know, pre-orders have been up in the air. We're gonna do it in, you know, 72 hours or a week from now. Be ready. Yeah. Uh, this is one that I'm super excited for. I think everybody in the Nintendo world is super excited for this one, right?

Um but yeah, we definitely put them together. I liked the lobby system. I appreciated that it was easy to get friends into the lobby, but if you remember, and from what I remember, and I'm sure Bear can correct me, it was always just like a game of chance on how the races went. If you remember, we'd all kind of pick what race you wanted, and then it would randomize it, right? And so, I always wanted a little more control of, well, hey, if I have all my friends here, let me pick the Grand Prix.

What do you want out of a battle mode? Uh, you know what? I I've really liked battle mode. I guess more maps. I I want it to be something that more people want to play. I guess when I think of Mario Kart 8 and the online stuff, there was no battle mode. It felt like only races.

But like we don't really do those often, nor are you buying a new console all the time to have these special editions. So the wrap was a brilliant move and so on PlayStation as well with these face plates of like, hey, you can change up your style. We can put these on. And the wrap is super easy of like you just quick wrap that up. You just velcro in the back and it's on and it looks cool as can be. I I really dig those. And this Doomslayer one, can we talk? Can we rewind to the Elite controller? Holy cow, man. Let's rewind that. People are also saying they did a a Cod Blobs wrap as well. I I have the Cod Blobs wrap is right. They did do that one. Is this the Elite? Um the red one. I think the Elite. Yeah, this is the Elite. This is giving Gears of War back in the day when they did the Gears of War uh controllers. And I love that.

Uh they detail even more in this April update on the Xbox Wire. But Mike, from the top level of what I just talked what I just mentioned to you there, how do you feel about it? Uh exciting stuff.

At one point, I thought I was going to be that, but I've really not done that.

Now here we are buying stuff. Very interesting of like where we are today. I like that. Yeah, I think I lean towards the Greg side of like how much I use my phone or even my computer at my desk to like redeem codes or buy things or scroll through things, right?

Let's I think that's the big jump as far as like what we want out of where Xbox is going to talk about, right?

This latest expansion for Destiny 2 is expected to be what was given the code name Apollo. Per the road map Bungie released back in September, Apollo was scheduled to release sometime in summer 2025. Apollo is planned to be a paid expansion with new stories, locations, missions, and more. However, it won't be the only update coming to the game. Bungie is also planning another full expansion called Behemoth for winter 2025, which will also have the major the two major updates leading into spring of next year.
