Are you surprised about the lack of Switch 2 pre-order info uh in this Nintendo Direct, the followup to the Switch 2's big blowout? Nintendo has shared more information on Mario Kart World's various features and modes. Let me just uh take a second to say something, Greg, because I don't think I've had the time on any show to say this. What a great name for this Mario Kart game. What a great name that somehow we didn't guess. When we were sitting there, none of us thought Mario Kart World. We're idiots. And the moment they revealed it, it's like, yeah, yeah. Very cool.

In a new Nintendo Direct focus solely on the game, Nintendo revealed some of the game's new courses, including the retro themed Mario Brothers Circuit, the urban Crown City, the canalbased Salty Salty Speedway, the Snowy Star View Peak, and a new haunted course, Boo Cinema, that looked awesome. New items set to feature in the game include the coin shell, which fires ahead, leaving coins behind, the ice flower, which freezes enemies, the hammer, which flies in an arc and wedges into the ground for a while, causing chaos for the other drivers, and kamic, which transforms opponents just like in Yoshi's Island. I thought the hammer was super cool. It is. It is. And had you already seen this? You saw it in your Yeah, I got to play with all these uh items.

So which is is it going to do more than like the mini speed boost? Do you think it's still it's still doing that? But it just seems like that stuff matters a bit more. I think maybe just with the 24 characters just having more. It's like the little specifically Knockout Tour like we've been saying that every lap quote unquote feels like the final lap. It feels like, oh man, this we we got to get it because you get knocked out otherwise, right? And this is the one where you lost IGN. Um, yeah, it is embarrassing. Um, but I think that the little coin boosts are going to matter more because of that, where it's like every second of the race means more.

And there seems to be more items and stuff based around coins like like this, uh, coin block being an example of that or coin shell. So, and there's more way more coin blocks actually that like you can hit in the level. So, I don't know like they I thought they were going to break a little more down into that in this direct and they didn't, but for my limited experience, I think coins are going to matter a bit more. I know we kind of talked about this, but we were talking more about um okay, we want what some people wanted out of this direct was why this game's worth $80. Deep dives into that.

So, it's like I I feel like it's just going to get to a point where hold out as long as you can because I don't think there's any need to get ahead of it. To your point, it's going to sell out no matter what. The the video game psychos like us and you listening or watching this show are in or out.

No, I think it's I think all of us in this industry should focus on our communities and the player base that we're building. I get inspired by what a lot of different creators do and other platform holders, but I believe in the plans that we have. Cool. Not surprising. What was surprising is no Xbox games at all in that Switch 2 direct. Yeah, right. I thought for sure we would have seen something out there. Yeah.

Okay. I apprec I appreciate the honesty. I If if Kingdom Hearts is your only Final Fantasy, I'd play Seven Remake. I think that's the right move. Okay. Yeah.
