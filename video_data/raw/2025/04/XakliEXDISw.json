I'm I was hoping you would just talk about what you thought so I could look for the press release. Still completely shocking. I didn't recognize the art style and just kind of the way their characters are rendered. And there was also a stunning lack of ah. So that's why I was like, this isn't a From Software game. We need somebody to say ah and then laugh at the end of their statement. But I'm still completely blown away. I thought it was going to be a Castlevania sort of remake. Weird sort of a a cool holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] what an awesome joining of worlds. But yeah, a brand new IP, a brand new video game, not a sequel, just a new thing for exclusively on the Switch 2.

And I really appreciate that from software amazing, incredible single player with a actually pretty decent online pedigree is going and really trying to innovate in that space. First with Night Rain and now with this. And what it sounds like is that you have kind of an interesting world or arena that you're playing with other players. Maybe almost a battle royale situation filled with the classical from software level design enemies bosses question mark and that has to be right. Oh yeah, we definitely saw a gigantic wolf looking.

I love that like right now we are seeing them throw some things at the wall and say, \"Hey, how do we at least try?\" And so I love that Night Rain is that, \"Hey, PVE, we got squad of three.

I love the idea of maybe me creeping up behind someone, maybe looking across the battlefield at one or two other people and seeing how we're going to engage with each other. You talk about it, cat. Like Miyazaki and his team at From Software have really made an incredible combat system that is fun and difficult to master and it's so engaging moment to moment that I would love to be able to battle others.

But then on the flip side of it, the reason why I was a lot cooler with Night Rain is because I'm like, well, Miyazaki is not working on this. Miyazaki we know is cooking the next big thing.
