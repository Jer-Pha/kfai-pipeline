Bless, how you doing? I'm doing real good. I'm doing real real good. Having a good day and I feel it keeps getting better. Like I I've loved we've now sitting here talking about all the games we're playing, whether it's Metroid Prime 4, Beyond, Mario Kart, uh World, uh the Gamecube games we got to do, just the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware in general. And I think talking to you about it is like making me even more excited than I I was earlier. It's like it's it's a fun debrief on like what was such an eventful day, well, such a good day, right, of getting to experience a new Nintendo console, but now we get to like break it all down and kind of like do our own therapy of oh yeah, let's talk about what we just experienced.

And uh in addition to that, whether it is or is not, um it's fine because uh the uh this seems like to be the placement of a 3D Mario, right?

The announcement was hilarious to me because I never thought we'd get another 3D Donkey Kong after Donkey Kong 64. It's It's wild because DK64, it's not a terrible video game. All right, let's start. No, no laughing back there, Roger. No laughing back there. No confidence. DK 64. Okay, here's the thing. I'll say with confidence. DK DK64 is not a terrible video game. He's right. It is not.

But that's that could be a whole No, but real do like what do you what it's better than Conquer? You think so? As far as gameplay and control, Conquer Conquer is fun as like oh it has a fun multiplayer mode and it's funny, but like the gameplay of Conquer isn't all that. Let's be real, guys. Yeah, it's not. Yeah, DK64 gameplay is better than Conquer gameplay. Okay, but how's the gameplay of Donkey Kong Bonanza? I like it a lot. Yeah.

There's a little thing there. There's a big, you know, bundle of bananas here. All right, cool.

I'm just like trying to make tunnels or whatever, right? There's so much uh uh destructible environment stuff in this game and the game revolves around uh the design of that and and it gets interesting and it gets a little bit complex in in that where you have different surfaces that act different ways.

Um, later on in the demo, I'm on a different surface that's more of a tougher surface, and I died because I was like trying to beat an enemy by picking up a piece of the ground and throwing it at them. And I looked at at the person that was demoing the game with me, and I was like, \"Hey, like is why isn't the thing working for me to pick it up?\" And he's like, \"Oh, you might be on a tougher surface.\" And I was like, \"Oh, it's like that.\" And like it kind of moves goes on as far as you have certain enemies that might be uh have a concrete shield and so you need to pick up a an explosive surface to throw at them. like they kind of go deep with the different geometries and like I don't know.

He has he has what? He's wearing pants. Oh, he's wearing pants, right? And open like collecting a golden banana and it being like oh banana. Like it has given me all the that I want. Those were like voice things. It wasn't just blessing that. Yeah. No, it's like it's literally Yeah. In the game it says it like that. Um which is a DK64 reference. But Tim, what did you think? I I I'm very all over the place with this one. Um obviously 3D platformers, huge fan. Nintendo platformers, huge fan. Donkey Kong, huge fan. Donkey Kong 64, not a huge fan.

What fun are they going to have with it?\" Seeing some like 2D inspired locations like that look more like Tropical Freeze and stuff. I was hyped for that. Like all that stuff seems great. And then when I got my hands on the controller, my first impression was, \"Oh, wow. This is a brilliant controller design. Uh you have jump on the the A, which on Nintendo is like the circle, you know, I mean, the right button, but then the um let's just call the face buttons by the direction.

And I thought that was really awesome. Um, having the different shoulder buttons do the different type of Donkey Kong moves you'd be familiar with. Like it all just makes sense. Being able to climb walls, uh, being able to just do all the Donkey Kong stuff. It feels right. This feels like they translated Donkey Kong, the rolling, you know, all of that into 3D in a great way. Um, and there was so much stuff that I really, really loved. I loved the um amount of secrets there seemed to be, how open the area was, and how it's one of those if you want to get there, you can find a way there. Yeah, I was surprised.

And then the demo kind of stopped there. They wouldn't let us sub layers are there. Like it felt vast and big and felt like there was going to be a lot there. Now my thing is I didn't love my time with this game and I'm very surprised by that. This seems like a very up my alley thing. The reason is the destruction stuff wasn't fun to me.

Um, like I think of Mario Odyssey and I think about how he moved and how Cappy allowed you to jump on him and you roll and jump and all that stuff. Mario and Donkey I get there different, but I don't like it's like, oh, the big monkey punches things. It kind of had that vibe to it. Um, and I I I hope that I'm wrong. This is early and like a lot can change.

I'm so hopeful. Or is it going to fall flat, right?

And doing all these things, right? This game feels like it is about digging for the solution. Yeah, pun intended. Yeah, Roger liked that. Yeah, I I didn't hate it. I didn't even dislike it. That's what I'm saying. I just Tim Getty's didn't love a brand new Nintendo 3D platformer the first time he played it. That to me, I think is just where I'm at with it. Uh and again, that can change.

M the thing that I'm the way that I framed it in my brain as far as what this game is to me, right, is like you talk about it being kind of like the Mario 3D platformer of the year. For me, I came out of it being like, \"Oh, this is like the Kirby in the Forgotten Land of the Year, right? In the sense of, hey, uh uh Donkey Kong hasn't had his own like 3D platformer in a long time.\" And this is they are taking this character that we know from Nintendo that is like on the forefront and defining it in a new way that if it hits like I don't think it's going to be Mario Odyssey levels necessarily, but I could see it being Kirby Forgotten Land levels. Yeah, absolutely. And and again, not a bad thing at all. And to run with that even more, I think that",

And to run with that even more, I think that a app comparison that I kept thinking about as I was playing it is uh 2D Mario versus 2D Wario where on paper you look at a very similar games, but the gameplay is so different because of what the gameplay focuses on. Whereas Mario is way more obstacle and speed and movement. Wario is a bit more slow, methodical, breaking things and puzzles, you know, and this kind of seems like that in a in a 3D sense of 3D Mario versus what this could be. Um, and yeah, I again I'm very excited for it. I think that the the July release date is very interesting to me of like I think that also fits of like maybe this isn't the big uh Nintendo EAD Mario Odyssey team game.

Am I crazy there? I feel what you're saying because if you replace this, it's a it's a it's a weird thing, right? We're going to get into ants, but like if you replace this with a Mario Odyssey 2, for example, I would look at this and be like, you're releasing Mario Kart and Mario Odyssey back toback like in like a month apart from each other. That's weird, right? Like now granted, this isn't a Mario thing, right? This is Donkey Kong, different character, different like I think you can make the argument of, oh no, we are looking at this as a completely separate franchise from a Mario Kart because we're Nintendo and we only have so many characters that we work",

I kind of look at Mario Kart as that and Metroid Prime 4 as that in a different way. But this almost feels like if there's a trinity, like this is the third one. If this is the big three, Roger, and we're talking about Kendrick, Drake, JCole, Donkey Kong is Don Kong is the JCole. No. Well, I guess Drake's number three now, right?

If it's not, I think I have very different expectations for this game. agree with you in terms of the presentation fidelity not saying switch to look out look at how technically impressive this is.

If you take that all the way, if you guys went so hard on this concept of Donkey Kong and destructibility in the levels, there's got to be some great ideas here in terms of what we're going to do with the game design. Yeah. And to be clear, for the 10th time, I don't want to come off as I'm hating here. I just want to be honest about my first thoughts on this thing. And a lot of that was backed up um not just looking at it visually and all that stuff because there was a lot",

So, I'm like, \"Okay, well, this is the technical aspects of it that are being added for the Switch 2 aren't that fun. I don't know if that really was worth it, whatever.\" And a big problem that I had with it is how often you're digging and the camera seems to be in a place where you're now kind of seeing through different surfaces and stuff. And I'm like, I don't like how the screen looks right now. Like, it's just like I don't really like the angles I'm looking at. And that seems to be the gameplay of it.

Let's see if it's got the stuff. One of the Switch 2's first big things. And again, yeah, I I'm very hopeful for it uh, turning out to be a fantastic adventure that I end up loving.

To be clear, not a bad looking game. Yeah. It's just kind of a let down for next generation Nintendo. Uh but when his fur gets wet, dude, when his fur gets wet, that's a wet fur. God, man. I'm just like, it's just one of those things like I remember seeing Star Fox's fur on the Gamecube when it got wet and how impressive that was. and seeing this, I was like, I'm not impressed.

Like there's like a lot of mechanics. You can pick up rocks and then like use them to speed through the level like Yeah, you can surf on the rocks. Dude, it gets it gets pretty. We only play this for 20 minutes. So, I was like, \"This seems like the fact that we're like learning about this as we're going up multiple playthroughs. Like, we each did different things.\" Like, this seems really deep. It strikes me as a different kind of 3D platformer. It's like a tinkerer's 3D platformer.

Yeah, we haven't heard. I mean, Nintendo's going hard with the Kong. Like you're absolutely right. And I I that makes me really really happy.

Again, as a OG Donkey Kong Country sicko, I I'm very sad to hear David Wise is not part of this at all. We're not going to get that classic Donkey Kong music. Doesn't seem like Grant Kirk Hope is either. Yeah. And the music when I said the Nintendo house style, like this sounds very similar to the Mario Kart and Mario Odyssey type stuff. Is that a complaint? No. Like, we're talking about some of the highest uh production value music in video games. So, I'm not mad at that stuff. It's different.

This is explorationbased as opposed to like obstacle necessarily. And I think that that's a very smart call for differentiating it from a Mario or something like that. But on top of that, climbing, there's no stamina meter. You can climb as long as you want and reminds me of DK64.
