Good morning, Bless. Good morning, Andy. How's it going? I'm doing great. I like sitting here. Yeah, we got a a different setup for Games Daily today. A more nostalgic vibe, I may say. Work from home, work from lab. Work from lab. Of course, we're recording from the lab because right now the main studio is going through some maintenance. I believe we're getting an electric uh vehicle charger installed outside. I'm stoked. Yeah. Oh, you have an electric car? Yeah, I do. Oh, that's so exciting. We just got one like literally just a couple months ago. You know what would be [\u00a0__\u00a0] up? I didn't I didn't notice until like a week ago.

No, you guys got to like There's no better time to buy. It's like got to pull the trigger. Buy the dip. Uh, but yes, there's maintenance happening in the main studio. So, we're recording, I think, all of our shows today, uh, from the lab. Uh, Andy, yeah, I had to come here and say that last night I went into a blueprints hole. I, uh, was weird to say it like that.

I am pulling from Jay Peters and Ash Parish at The Verge. Nintendo has announced a new date for when Switch 2 pre-orders will kick off in the US. April 24th. As a part of the announcement, Nintendo said that the price of the Switch 2 will remain at $450 despite fears that the Trump administration's new tariff policy would lead to increased pricing for the console. However, Nintendo also said that the Switch 2 accessories would be more expensive. The Switch 2 Joy-Con, Pro Controller, and Switch 2 camera have all",

Pre-orders were originally set to begin on April 9th, but Nintendo delayed that following the Trump administration's announcement of new tariffs. On April 8th, Nintendo also announced that it would be delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in Canada, quote, in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the US. End quote. With this news, Canada will be will be able to pre-order the Switch 2 on April 24th as well. Nintendo's new pre-order date follows President Trump announcing on April 9th that he had authorized a 90-day pause on tariffs outside of China.

Check this out. 3D view of the Pro Controller. Look at that. Oh, that's cool. I like that. Cool. Pretty neat. That's pretty neat. Nintendo today. It's coming up. Yeah. And Soulcalibur 2 gameplay. Check that out. Yeah. There's a lot of good. Um, I think this is fantastic news. I I am I am elated about it not going up, but then the accessory prices are like, oh, hm. They were already kind of expens expensive to begin with. Yeah, JoyCons have always notoriously been more expensive than I always assume.

So, Nintendo's in this weird place of all right, we have this thing that we want to release that we want to do well, but we're kind of at the mercy of how this thing goes with the tariffs. And I think I predicted that the price would stay the same as far as like it coming out at launch. But I think as soon as these tariffs go up like or if these tariffs come back and are re reenacted, depending on what that looks like, I think these prices will go up. On the Nintendo website, Nintendo.com, um, one of the things they mentioned with the press release talking about them maintaining the price.

We want to maintain that 450. As soon as those tariffs come in, that price is raising. And I think for them, like you even maybe want to launch with the 450. That way when the prices do raise, you can easily be like, \"Not our fault. Not not us. That's the that's the US government. Sorry. What do you expect from us?\" Yeah, I I totally agree with that. I think that is a a somewhat convenient way to absolve themselves of just, you know, wanting to to make more money at that point.

And you hope that I I think for them it's like, \"All right, we'll ride the wave in the way that everybody else is going to have to ride the wave at the same time.\" Like at the same time where switch two prices go up, you expect that other platforms, other goods, other like you know uh technological things, right, are going to go up in price at the same time, right?

So to see those go up a bit more, that is I think a I think it's kind of a band-aid solution right now for them. Yeah. Not that they're hurting in any way.
