Speaking of of Snowike, Mike, uh, real quick, I want to say a lot of people have been asking um if we're going to do a follow-up to his Final Fantasy 10 first half review now that he's beaten the game. The answer is, of course, we are. So, next week, we me and him will be doing another one-on-one talking all about Final Fantasy 10.

Everyone strap in amid continued frustration and confusion from fans about how much the Nintendo Switch 2 and its games are going to cost them, especially in the United States where that seems to be perpetually in flux. We just learned about yet another charge that may not have been obvious to everyone at first. Zelda Breath of the Wild Switch 2 edition does not come with the expansion pass, meaning you'll have to pay an additional $20 to to play the new DLC. Sorry, not new, to play the DLC on the new system if you don't already own it. Uh, that might sound like a no-brainer, but let me explain.

Since the announcement of Switch 2's games and their pricing last week, there's been no end to the confusion about how it's all going to work. Uh what we currently know is that if you already own this uh Breath of the Wild on Switch, you can play that game on your Switch 2, including the DLC if you've already purchased it, no problem. However, there's also a Nintendo Switch 2 enhanced edition of Breath of the Wild. I want to [\u00a0__\u00a0] shoot myself. Uh it comes with improved visuals and performance achievements, as well as support for the new Zelda Note service in the Nintendo Switch online app. If you already own Breath of the Wild, you won't get these features automatically, but you can purchase an upgrade pack for $10 to get access to all of that.

So, that leaves folks who don't own the game yet at all, but might want to purchase it on the Switch 2, they could purchase the Switch 2 enhanced edition of Breath of the Wild for $70, $10 more than the game initially retailed at. So, basically the price of the original game and the pack, but it won't include the DLC pack. So, you won't have access to that. If you want access to that, it's another $20 on top of that. So, $90 for the full Breath of the Wild 2 Nintendo Switch 2 experience. I said something's wrong there. You [\u00a0__\u00a0] get it.

I don't I don't even have a rant about this. It's more so questions about what our expectations are around upgrades, around weird Nintendo decisions, and around what we want out of this, right? Cuz like I think when I when I look at a an enhanced edition of a game, typically I'll say a lot of the time, if not most of the time, when you're getting that either I don't even want to say complete edition because they've they've never framed this as a complete edition. They're saying this is the next gen edition of this thing. Most of the time for AAA companies that does come with a DLC. It almost is packaged like a complete edition or a game of the year edition which comes with DLC or something like that, right? This isn't that.

Xbox tried too many strategies at once which I think then created the situation where it's like all right well now your only choice is to be everywhere to sell these games cuz the games are not selling on Xbox alone.

Developer Hangar 13 and publisher 2K called The Old Country the start of a new crime saga for the acclaimed mafia franchise.

Wow. On the performance side, but to explain that the game will benefit from numerous technical features like frictionless loading, selective installation, and SSD optimization on PS5 and Pro. The game targets a stable 60 frames per second on PS5 consoles. And if you find yourself stumped by any of the puzzles, you can consult the community game help hub. Really? Why? Why?
