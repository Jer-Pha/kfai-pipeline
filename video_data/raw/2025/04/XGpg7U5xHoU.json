Uh the the standout matches just off the top of my head are honestly the number one match for me is the Naomi and Jade match. I'm very excited about that match. I love that leadup.

The only way they don't win is if Big E comes out and screws them out of it. And this gets Big E to be their, you know, counterpoint that they're going to chase out.
