It's the end of the work week, end of the school week, and oh boy, do we got a special one for you. You know, Thursday night there was a lot of back and forth. Kevin Kella got addicted to blueprints. He came up to me said, \"What if we play play Blueprints tomorrow?\" I said, \"Me and Andy are playing Steel Hunters.\" And he said, \"Well, what if we don't do that?\" And I said, \"No, no, we're going to play Steel Hunters.\" He said, \"Well, what if we just get Andy to play Blueprints?\" And I said, \"He won't like that, but we'll try.\" And Andy later that night said, \"Absolutely not.\" I said, \"You guys can do that.\" He said, \"Absolutely not. I'm playing that on my own on my Steam Deck. And so Andy said, \"No, that's for me, you know.\" Have you started it yet? Yeah, I started it last night, but maybe maybe the gummy I took",

Oh my god, I'm forgetting what happened 10 seconds prior. So Andy said no to that. So then we came into work. Kevin's cranked up on blueprints. Blessing looks at me and goes, \"Mike, you thought it said 300 p.m., but I got us codes to play rematch from the people who made Sefue. Let's go play soccer.\" And I said, \"Blessing, get the boys together. We're hitting the pitch.\" How did you get codes, by the way, Bless that, you know? I'm just like that. And so, here we are. We're going to play rematch for the first ever time all together to have some fun. You'll be seeing my screen, Annie Screen, and Blessing Screen.
