One of which was to not only tell a story with a young Steve Rogers who will still uh who's still trying to find his feet as opposed to a more seasoned guy that we've seen in a lot of the films. Also, let us introduce a new Black Panther of 1943. It led us to tap into all things that I love. All of the wonderful tropes of World War II era adventure films, classic man on a mission movies, and all that. There's a lot of intrigue in our story, a lot of twists and turns, fascinating characters, and interesting locations.
