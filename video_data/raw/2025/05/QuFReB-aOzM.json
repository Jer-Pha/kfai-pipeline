We have all this and more because this is kind of funny games [Music] daily. Yo, what's up? Welcome to Kind of Funny Games Daily for Friday, May 23rd, 2025. I'm one of your hosts, Blessing Addio Jr. Joining me is WWE legend Rag Miller. Hello, Bless. Welcome back to the office. Thanks for having me. I'm happy to have you. You and I are rarely in the office at the same time anymore, so it's nice to see you. I was I was hanging out with friends. Are we doing Interlock Fingers? I was hanging out with friends in LA um yesterday. name and Rihanna and Danny. Um and I was telling them cuz I saw them I saw Danny last week as I saw both actually last week as well. Sure.

And we were talking about it and we're like is this a sign of like maybe people are getting out of Summer GameFest to do their own events throughout the month of May? Cuz it feels like it feels like Mayday. It doesn't feel like playday. You know what I mean? That was good. I like that. I like that. I think honestly that's a great interpretation of reading the tea leaves and seeing something that used to be what we call judges week. Do you remember ever hearing about this? Judges week used to be something that Jeff set up uh before E3. And the idea was, hey, at E3 all the major publications are going to be too busy to see smaller games. So, let's do an event in May for one week. Everybody would go down there and go to all these different hotel lobbies and",

You'd get hands-on with it. That way at E3 you could focus on the coverage, the news, the whatever and not do it. So it's interesting yeah to see that happening now but in an unorganized fashion. So it is similar to what we you had to do this week where we got hit up about an event on Wednesday, right? And then I was like, and sure, bless will go. And then two days later, a different event hits up for an event on Thursday. And I was like, well, blessing's already there, so if you'll pay for hotel room, that'll work.

We haven't. This is a reveal of that information. Everybody, hey, how are you? uh you know years past we have sent all of us down to SGF to cover and that's not 100% true but last year we sent all of us the year before that we said all of us and this year I mean like the Switch 2 launches on Thursday of that week you've seen the articles and headlines already that Nintendo is not sending them out ahead of time.

Here's Sega trying to get the newest Sonic out to you, and that's a big deal cuz it's one of them.

And then I come back and I'll tell you about what I played in LA and what I thought was cool. And to be fair, I do have like a little bit of the feeling of FOMO just in the sense of leading into um Summer GameFest. I've had so many people hit me up, like friends hit me. They're like, \"Yo, are you gonna be in town for Playdays?\" And I'm like, \"No, like we're not sending everybody this year.\" And they're like, \"What? Why?

So, we get to the end of the episode and you ask questions like no. And that's it everybody. And then after that, Games Cast is going to be a long ESO stream celebrating the end of our four-part limited series. Very excited about that. Yeah. You know, I I had played a b I had played ESO at launch a little bit uh on PC and then thought I'd come back for console and then life got too complicated and I've touched it on console a few times since then, but when they did this, I stayed away from playing it because I wanted to be the noob.

We have five stories today. Bakers do. Starting with story number one, Sony's next PlayStation State of Play will reportedly be coming in June. I got a super chat question for you. This is from Chriscolian at VGC at Video Games Chronicle. By the way, my super chat question is, \"What big announcement do you expect from a State of Play coming this summer?\" Uh, the article reads, \"The next PlayStation presentation is coming in June and is likely to be a state of play instead of a showcase, it is claimed. Giant bomb journalist Jeff Grub stated uh during today's episode of Game Mess uh that other reliable insiders were saying uh they hadn't heard anything about a May",

            "text": "of a showcase, it is claimed. Giant bomb journalist Jeff Grub stated uh during today's episode of Game Mess uh that other reliable insiders were saying uh they hadn't heard anything about a May event from Sony coming this year.\" Well, I haven't either, Grub said. And that's because something's happening in June. It's a June thing. Now, is that going to be a big showcase? I don't think so. Uh, Grub said back in February that according to his sources, Sony hadn't yet decided whether to hold its annual PlayStation 5 showcase this summer or a smaller scale state of play. In today's claims, he says the company has likely opted for the latter. Quote, I said a couple months ago that I heard that they were discussing going back and forth about a showcase or a state of play. Sounds like they probably settled on a state of play. He said, quote, I'm not 100% about that aspect of it. It's probably a state of play, though, but I have heard June. They're being very guarded, he said. Just getting",

They're being very guarded, he said. Just getting the details that there's something happening in June was kind of difficult to come by. So, it does make me feel like they are hiding some stuff, although that is pure speculation. Rumor and speculation from Jeff Grub, of course. Greg, does this do anything for you? I mean, yeah, state of plays are exciting. I want to do this, but it's also like it makes perfect sense to do one, right? It is the E3 time frame. It is SGF time. It is whatever. I'm sure PlayStation has something to say. It's more the is it going to be just a third party showcase of other stuff that we've seen or whatever with another look at Yote, you know what I mean? Or is it going to be a big deal? And here is something fresh and exciting. Can I give my hot take? I'd love a hot take. I don't think it matters if it's a state of",

The way this news hits me is of course we're getting something like I think the fact that it's June, it's like all right, cool. We're not usually getting the end of May thing that we that we get from PlayStation every year, but PlayStation's not missed the beat for a summer thing, right? It's either a state of play or a PlayStation showcase, but they've always been able to hit that May to June uh time frame. I think more often than not, like the state of plays have been fairly impressive, even compared to some of the PlayStation showcases. Of course, PlayStation showcases usually mean you're getting more firstparty announcements. And so, we have that level of anticipation.

And then also like but a state of play means you're not getting a Naughty Dog game. you're not getting a Sure. But that could still happen at a summer gamefest, right? Like we've seen stuff pop up uh there. And then also like I look at the I believe it was the last showcase. Was it was it the showcase where we got Concord and Marathon and Fair Games and it was [\u00a0__\u00a0] trash. I don't want to say trash. It was not good. It was the the wrong tone to set and it has blown up in their face repeatedly.

And so the God of War Greek game coming out later this year or maybe early next year. Yeah, I could see that. But I don't view that as like I don't expect that to be a big like God of War Ragnar Ragnarok style thing. I I assume that that's going to be a smaller scale project.

Last of Us for me as somebody who likes the show and loves the game, I feel like is less of a necessary adaptation versus something like Fallout because Fallout does do a great job of going, \"All right, what do people want out of the world from Fallout? What do you get when you play the game of Fallout?\" And they give us an original story. They give us like these original vaults. They give us essentially like new quests to go on with this crew of characters and it feels so true to Fallout.
