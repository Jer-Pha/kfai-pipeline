We'll have all this and more because this is kind of funny games daily. [Music] What's up and welcome to kind of funny games daily for Thursday May 29th 2025. We are running out of the days of May. Greg, that means next week is upon us. Switch to SGFO. Tonight I'm watching Karate Kid Legends. We're going to do uh in review tomorrow. Very excited about that. After that, we're doing a double feature. I'm watching Final Destination Bloodlines again. Okay, that that I can get down with. It's so good. These Final Destination movies, they just know how to get people. These are theater movies, experiences, if you will.

Anna de Armis about to kick ass once again. Remember last time we saw her kicking ass, she was Paloma in James Vaughn. God, she was good in that. Was she recently dating Ben Affleck or was that an old thing? At some point she was. Yeah, but how recent was that? Is that a post J? I don't. It might still be happening. Are they still dating chat? Let us know. I'm not I'm not up to date on my demise lore, but I'm excited for Ballerina the week after that though. Greg, I appreciate you like all these movies so much.

And then I whispered and I'm going to get Mario. That is so terrifying to tell a three-year-old. He didn't hear the whisper part, probably. Oh, okay. Yeah, we were watching Justice League, the animated series today. Decided to start that for him, which is usually fine, but then his, you know, stick in the mud mom was there.

Those top men will all rush back here with their Switch twos and we will stream us unboxing them, setting them up, playing Mario Kart World, having a great time. So that's the thing.

Roger and Mike go home and sleep. Then the rest of us after games daily stream the Nintendo Switch 2 all day long including while we play Mario Kart World.

As sad as it is, I think when we talk about this, we often talk about, oh, there's all these layoffs. Oh my gosh, all these devs are out of work. Blah blah blah. And we do that thing where, oh my god, 300 people got laid off. Oh, the studio closed. Bl. And you don't get those personal touches, those personal storylines. And obviously, social media is so fractured these days and so deep and distant in a lot of different ways. If you're not following these people or game developers who are retweeting it, you'd never see these stories.

And then to find out that the EA game also would have had us not playing as Tchala, you assume for most of it. I assume if there's multiple player characters at the end, maybe somewhere in the middle, you have to go save your son, right? and redraw the co the Black Panther mantle.

For those asking, \"I have not been asked to repraise my role as Chia in the Persona 4 remake,\" Fitzgerald wrote on Blue Sky. \"Rip, I'm blessed to have recorded as many Persona 4 games as I did playing her.\" \"Neither Sega nor Atlas has adowed a remake of Persona 4, but reports have persisted for some time that what's happen.

The ruling said Trump may still be able to implement import taxes of 15% for 150 days on certain countries where the US is in a major trade deficit. However, the US government may have to refund companies that paid the tariffs. George Mason University professor El Ilia Sabin, who worked on a related tariff case, told Politico, \"Anybody that had that has had to pay tariffs so far, will be able to get them refunded.\" The US justice system is appealing the decision, and it's possible the case could be heard by the US Supreme Court if it goes far enough.

I mean, obviously that PlayStation might be making a handheld PlayStation. But yeah, I think that clearly there's a growing desire and need. And guess what all the companies want to do? They want to sell you stuff. They want to sell you things. And so even if it's a niche device like the Portal has been, the Portal out kicked the cover. It was more successful than they thought it was going to be, right? and they continue to support it and just make it more viable for for more people and it continues to sell very well. I I think my thing is we'll never see a dedicated handheld from the big three. No, no, no, no. Yeah, I agree with that. But yeah, like a a hybrid kind of cross thing. I think absolutely. But I also feel like the portal could just kind of turn into that. Like I can see them riding the portal and iterating on the portal into being more of a",

Yeah. Oh, interesting. Okay. But I think you're gonna get a PlayStation handheld cuz I just think that what what are we talking about? Like what is it going to play? I think that at the end of the day, PlayStation games, probably PlayStation 5, but I imagine that that'll be still using cloud stuff to some extent and then there'll be some games that are playable via the hardware and all that stuff. Like I don't think we're ever going to get something that this plays all your PS5 games. Like I don't think we're going to get that until 10 years from now and then we will but that'll be on something else that's also doing cloud stuff in addition to interesting. I disagree. I think I",

I disagree. I think I think the handheld day they launch will play PlayStation 5 games period. Yeah. When? Probably right before PlayStation 6, maybe a year before that. Maybe right alongside it again. What are they going to do with their generations and consoles and how they going to talk about it? Yeah. But I think it's a ways out. I think Xbox seems like they're ahead of them and how openly they're talking about it, but they're openly talking about it. So, who knows? Um, man, Caesar Splitz on says, \"Greg, do you feel bad about ghost caught by Ghostbusters trapped in that phantom realm machine?\" Well, first off, it's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] containment unit. I'd really like you to use the right terminology. Uh, you know, it's something I thought at large about. Uh, and it's probably maybe I should just do the Greg way about",

Uh, and it's probably maybe I should just do the Greg way about it tomorrow because I feel like it's we're trying to get out of here. Stella's waiting in the waiting room to talk about Outer World. So, it's not The short answer is no. Most of the ghosts you see the Ghostbusters catching are evil or not cognizant creatures like slime. From my perspective, the Ghostbusters are the ones that are evil. That was Star Wars. See what he did there? You figure to look back at the pantheon of ghosts, the Ghostbusters have busted throughout the movies. It's either some kind of god, right, or a mindless beast from another dimension when we're talking about some of the things that have been pulled in. Uh, so to look at somebody like the really only humanoid ghosts we see that the Ghostbusters have then caught entrapped in a permanent structure would be the Scaleri",

So if you're asking me Greg, do you sympathize with serial killers? No. And I ask you to look in the mirror and ask yourself, do you do that? And also learn what a contamin is called. I got to get through the rest of the super chats because it's very important. Danesta says, \"GeFeforce now is available native on Steam Deck as of today.\" That is that should have been in at least we news. Big stuff. It's awesome. It's running great. Everybody wins. Hell yeah. Then uh there's two more that we have to get to. Nightlife says, \"Will you take your socks off when fighting Mario?\" No, I won't have time. Okay. And then he's got to come in.

Give us two Pokemon codes or you'll never see Yoshi again. Push him away. I'm not going to fight him right away. It was me. I have to a threat. Well, I mean, we I gotta get two Pokemon codes so we can both review it. So, that's what So, I can't immediately. You know what sucks? We used to get two Pokemon codes because we'd get blue and red, but now, oh, it's just it Why isn't there a Z and an A? Ah, I see you're saying it's bad. I need to reread Nightlife's first super chat and then we're going to read one new super chat to end the show. I don't even want commentary. I just need everybody to deal with the rivalry that's about to go down. We're starting a war on this show right now.
