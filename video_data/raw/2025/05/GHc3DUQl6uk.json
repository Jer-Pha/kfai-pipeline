I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the taste maker, Roger Piccorn. Hi, Greggy. How you doing? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing good. I feel like I'm a normal person again, finally. You know what I mean? after the 60 hours of freaking it all weekend with Mike playing Death Stranding. 54 hours in that game and I just started from the beginning of that stream to the end which is insane.

I will not be walking. We'll just finish it up. Uh, and then we'll be able to talk about on a Games Cast, which Oh, you do a little Games Cast for you. I just that's all I want to play. Like I booted it up last night. I booted up last night on my Steam Deck. I was like, I just want to just grind and make zip lines and all that stuff, but I'm right at the ending.

Number one, Sony considers PS5 price hikes to cover Trump's tariffs. This is Dominic Preston over at The Verge. Sony just announced its financial forecast for the next year, and it's expected to be impacted by tariffs to the tune of $680 million US. To compensate, the company says it's considering options, including moving manufacturing to the US and increasing prices for consumers. Speaking to investors during the company's earnings",

Speaking to investors during the company's earnings call, Sony CFO Lynn Tao confirmed that the company is considering quote passing on and quote the price to tariff of tariffs to consumers in order to mitigate the impact on the bottom line. Tao didn't mention the PS5 by name, though, and it's possible that Sony could try to protect pricing on its console, though increases elsewhere in the electronics business. or through increases elsewhere in the electronics business. Sony has already increased the price of the PlayStation 5 this year, but only in the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Roger. Hi. I mean, there's more story here, and I'll do it.

He admitted that the console quote can be produced locally and that it would be quote an efficient strategy that has been considered going forward. Over the 12 months ending March, Sony shipped 18.5 million PlayStation 5 consoles, down slightly from 20.8 8 million the year before, bringing its lifetimes shipments to 77.7 million shipped.

I apologize for select other uh electronics. Microsoft has already raised the price of its Xbox console up by $100, though Nintendo has so far elected to keep Switch 2 pricing the same ahead of its launch next month.

So any some super chats in here to plow through. Jay plays casual. What do you think the increase will be? 50 to 150 across the board for a PS5 lineup. I think again I'm a big idiot and don't understand economics. I'd imagine it would mirror what Xbox has done where PlayStation 5 regular gets this percentage of an upgrade in this PlayStation 5 Pro gets this much if it is all based on chips and imports and this that and the other. I think there'd be some reason to do it there. Uh oh, Silk Gamer says, \"Do you think this extends the console generations?\"",

And this again where I just go crossey because there's so many goddamn things going all over the place, but you see it going for Xbox. Yeah. So, the S the two S models seem to have gone up by $80. It's wild. Uh the X models seem to have gone up by a full hundred. Um and then the two terabyte X went up to 130 bucks. This [\u00a0__\u00a0] still blows my mind. Like I would have bet money that Xbox would have tried to figure out a way to keep the Series S specifically at a lower price. which again I think speaks to what this actually is.

This isn't a oh, we can raise the prices and take advantage. They know they're going to lose consumers. They know they're locking people out of especially Xbox when when they're at a place right now where they are very much in third place and people are not buying these consoles. And maybe that was one they built to be, you know what I mean? But hold on. The Portland Kevin also everything's an Xbox now. So true. Yep. It's true. Uh, the Portland Cabin doubles down on the question I asked, but we didn't answer. Got away from uh, what do the higher priced consoles do to the timeline for the next generation?

Uh, the tech experts at Digital Foundry have revealed the final tech specs for Nintendo Switch 2 and with it claimed that game chat feature has a significant impact on system resources to the point where developers are said to be concerned. During last month's Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed the Switch 2's game chat functionality triggered by a press of the C button on the new Joy-Con. Players can watch each other enjoying the game or different titles and with the help of a camera even see each other. It's made all the easier by a built-in",

It's made all the easier by a built-in microphone that is shown to be relatively reliable regardless of the player's gaming environment. The C buttons chat menu aims to be an all-in-one multiplayer feature that could result in Nintendo's most successful online push in decades. Digital Foundry said Nintendo provides developers with a game chat testing tool that simulates API latency and L3 cache misses that the realworld game chat incurs on the system. Okay, are we keeping up? We all in still. We're going in deeper, everybody. All right. L3 was the L3 button. Yeah, me too.

Interesting. If game chat resources are within the system allocation, it shouldn't make any difference. However, given Nintendo provides game chat emulation tools, the suggestion is there is a hit of some description the developers need to test for. As Digital Foundry put it, quote, \"We'll be interested to see how Game Chat may or may not impact game performance as this does seem to be an area of developer concern.\" End quote. We won't know for sure until Switch 2 comes out on June 5th. Meanwhile, Digital Foundry revealed the Switch 2's final tech specs.

As part of those cuts, Microsoft closed Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arcane Austin. In total, Microsoft let go uh 2550 staff from its gaming business since acquiring Activision Blizzard for $69 billion in 2023.
