I was like, you know, let's do something different. Of course, it's not different to be Taylor Swift, but you see uh the aptitude I chose there in your lower left was tossball team mascot, so she's inspiring more little stuff like that.

Uh, you see, my strength is still average, but I think Out of Worlds is pretty easy, so it hasn't been a big deal for me. You can jump into my skills, though. See, I've built it out. I've maxed out my one-handed melee, so I'm just beating the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of things when I get out there. Uh, I was drawn to dialogue. Uh, so I push those up high. Same thing with snalth.

Dr. Leora Blossom was an extraordinary scientist and a friend. We have a murderer on the loose, inspector. As if the death of Hion Helen wasn't enough of a blow to our facility. [Music] Her commitment to her NDA was admirable. I'll make sure to accelerate the payout of her death benefits to her next of kin. Interesting. The Rizzo's family is a small family inspector. Most of us recognize one another. Still, any information is good information. It troubles me to believe Leora could have been murdered by one of our own. If there's anything else you'd like to share, you have my attention. insisted. That's interesting.

This incident at the orchards must be connected to Helen's murder somehow. I don't know how, but I feel it in my marrow. You should inspector. This case is under your jurisdiction, not mine. I leave it in your hands. When you're ready, I suggest a word with the hotel coroner. She should have finished her autopsy by now. Let's check in with Dr. Goodn Night. Hey, Cap. Looks like they finally sent someone to clean up Helen's mess. At least I hope that's what he's here for. Oh, sweet chimbering love. Where'd you come from? Sorry. Let me just get back in character.

I am acting on behalf of Mr. Hallirdie. The wholemeister the hacked meister. I don't have a lot of time, but Mr. Birdie sent me to retrieve a message.

That means that of course on Thursday the Nintendo Switch 2 will come out and we'll be streaming that, reacting to that, being crazy about that. Friday will be the Summer GameFest stream, which we will live react to, do a pre-show, a post show, a live reaction to. Saturday of that week, I'll go down to Xbox or no, I'll go down to SGF and play a bunch of Xbox, PlayStation, PC, Switch games, maybe Switch two games. I hadn't thought about that.
