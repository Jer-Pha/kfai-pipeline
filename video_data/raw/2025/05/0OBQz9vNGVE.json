The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.

Uh Bloomberg's Jason Shrier on Blue Sky said, \"Nobody I've talked to at Rockstar has believed fall 2025 was a real window for a very long time now. Too much work, not enough time, and what appears to be a real desire for management to avoid brutal crunch. GTA 6 slipping to 2026 has seemed inevitable for months, if not longer.\" \"Uh, wait, crunch, you say, Jason?\" Someone on Blue Sky said they don't believe Rockstar is trying to avoid crunch. Jason responded. Skepticism is always healthy, but I've been keeping tabs on this for years since my big 2018 story about Red Dead 2's crunch. They certainly haven't eliminated all over time, but everyone I've talked to at Rockstar says it's night and day from previous projects. If",

They certainly haven't eliminated all over time, but everyone I've talked to at Rockstar says it's night and day from previous projects. If that changes, I'll report on it. Uh, Circon's Matt Piscatella on Blue Sky says GTA 6 getting pushed does not mean there that all of a sudden there'll be a whole bunch of dollars available for other games in 2025. It just means that a bunch of the dollars that would have been spent on gaming this year have disappeared. Uh we'll get to more details about stock and stuff like that, but Jeff, I want to hear your thoughts on this. Are you surprised? Uh no, no. I mean, there's multiple factors, right, where it's um I think the the simplest one, the aams razor here is you look at the history and Rockstar delays games. They delay games multiple times. And I I just feel like this is mostly that. Um even, you know, taking into consideration the desire to avoid crunch, which is something I' I've heard",

They're going to have to like sprint a little bit to get this thing out. Um, but there are other factors, too. Like, this is, you know, the game they're going to release. And when I say that, I mean like for the next 10 to 15 years, this is the game. You know, they might have a Red Dead 3 at some point, but the thing that's going to print money for them is going to be whatever Grand Theft Auto Online 2 looks like. and they can make a lot more money if that has a smooth like start, a smooth launch.

They acquired uh UGC companies, uh, userenerated content companies to help them basically build a platform so people can build stuff inside of Grand Theft Auto. They're making Roblox here. Roblox is a game that's 20 years old. That game came out in 2006. Roblox for adults. Yeah. 20 2006 for Roblox. Wow. I did not know that. I would have sworn that Roblox was like a 2015 thing. I know, right? But it's been around for forever. And uh, you know, that was from a time when that was a weird thing. Uh, now it's pretty normal. you know, Grand Theft Auto Online 1 and Grand Theft Auto 5 been running for more than 10 years now.

Obviously, they'll be able to push it like bring it back like it is too big to fail at a certain point, but they don't want to fail. They want to get it right because that is more money in their pockets right away and they don't have to spend years sort of fixing something when they could have just got it right in the first place. So, I think I think that's a big motivating factor here. Uh, beyond the what I believe is a pretty honest desire to avoid crunch. Uh, Joshua Mills super chat saying, \"I say 50/50 chance it gets delayed again to fall 2026.\" Would that surprise you? No. No. I I I don't think any sort of delay with this game would really surprise me uh at any point. It is just so massive and and um you know, it's",

So it's it's going to just take a lot of effort here and I you know it is at this point uh a year uh from now and really they were planning to maybe release it this fall. So, I guess we can call it a six-month delay. But, of course, internally, the people actually doing the work never believed it was coming out this year. But, okay, an extra 6 months, let's just call it that for the sake of the conversation. What can they really do? It's",

We've heard many times stories of games coming together in the last 6 months to a year and really finding the fun at that point. And I'm sure they've got a good idea of what this game should be, but I bet they're like, if we just had that extra time, we really could make this what it needs to be to set us up for the next 10 to 15 years. Totally. Now, May 26, we got to talk about that release date. That is I mean, that must be the furthest out release date announcement for a video game we've ever had.

They're they're trying to make it clear like listen, we understand you weren't expecting a delay. So when we give you the delay, let's give you the information that you do want. Here's an exact date so you can plan on us, you know, to the stockholders making that revenue in this window. and and yeah, that's you know them definitely throwing a bone while they are giving the bad news.

But um I do wonder though I wonder so that being like them calling the actual date like and obviously that could change and it being pushed to fall next year would not surprise anybody. them calling that date out. I I wonder if that is them trying to play nice with the industry to an extent because we have had so many conversations of the fear that everyone's had about where they're where to place their games and like I I don't know like why would they care but at the same time like they need the industry to be healthy to have people playing games and buying games to even be interested in playing and buying GTA 6 no matter how big",

And there's likely a co-arketing deal probably with PlayStation, maybe with Microsoft, but I would bet it was with it's with PlayStation. And when when those conversations happen, there's probably someone, you know, up high who talks to the people that go in those meetings, say, \"Hey, if you could, could you get us a goddamn date for when this thing's coming out just to help us out over here?\" And when we started getting some dates in the last couple of weeks with like those take two games, picking a date, and then go see.

Earlier today, Rockstar announced a significant delay to GTA 6, which is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time. And that's not hyperbole. That's just so wild. Uh, it was due out fall 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S, but will now release on May 26, 2026. That's a shift from Take 2's 2026 financial year to its 2027 financial year. Early trading in Take 2 stock saw a almost 8% fall in value at the time of this article's publication. In a statement issued on the corporate website, Take 2 reiterated its expectation that the company will achieve sequential increases in and record levels of uh net bookings revenue in fiscal year 2026 and 7.",

I don't like this era of Sack Boy eraser.

Uh this comes from Alan Solo from the giant bomb community. Thank you so much. Yeah. Uh Kuma Bomb says, \"Sack boy walked so that Astrobots could run.\" Yeah, I think that's right. Astros kind of usurped his position. Yeah. Um and then we had a couple I wanted to get to. Oh, CJ Splitzon says, \"Grub, please give us Sony fans some hope. Showcase State of Play. What about a surprise game announcement this year? Do you know anything? You got any stuff to talk about?

I mean, like I I did talk about a few weeks ago that that what I had heard was they were debating internally between a state of play versus a showcase, you know, and I know this audience understands the distinction there. Um, and they had not decided a few weeks ago and I have not heard anything. I've also not asked. Um, you know, now that I've got a little bit more time, maybe maybe I'll do exactly that. we are getting pretty close where I bet they have made a decision there and you know I I don't have full like transparency into that process or what that looks like. That's just kind of how it was phrased to me. Um but that to me that what that says is they have stuff to talk about. Do they have the time and bandwidth for their teams to build an asset for a showcase?

Can you, you know, take hours out of your day to it's very time consuming. So, uh, I bet that is the hangup there. Uh, but I think the good news is they probably will have stuff to talk about one way or another at some point. Yeah. I mean, it's interesting to look at. I think PlayStation's in a in a weird spot right now because we've waited so long for answers of like what's happening, what's coming out, and now we're in a a weird place where we know Death Stranding 2 and the date is imminent and then now we know Ghost and the date is something that we're building towards.

I I wouldn't necessarily expect a PlayStation showcase in a couple weeks that's going to blow our minds because I just don't think that timing wise like we're set up for that. Like if if we didn't know that Ghost was in October, I'd be like maybe they got a big fall game, but we know the big fall game. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure there there's discussions about like what the benefits would be of putting on a big mind-blowing showcase if they could at this point. And you're right. I bet there's some conversation of like, do we need that in this moment? we have games to sell people that will get people to buy PS5.

Uh and I mean, yeah, I guess just talking about Summer Gamefest season, like it's it's going to be a weird one because I don't expect we're going to get much from Nintendo because we just got their big uh blowout. I mean, not only that, like, you know, we're going to go to Summer GameFest, right? I should be there. I'm planning to be there. And do you expect like a lot of developers from outside of the country to want to travel to the United States? I bet a lot of them like be like, I might not even want to do that. Well, might be the perfect time to travel cuz they'll have the Switch too. You know what I mean? On the plane, play Mario Kart. There you go. That that makes it real good. Yeah. Yeah. No, real talk.

Um, that's right. So, it's like that. I think it's going to be interesting. I I feel like we're probably going to get the most multiconole news from Xbox. Like I think we're going to get a lot of games announced at the Xbox showcase that are coming to Switch 2 and PS5 and of course Xbox and PC. I I wouldn't be surprised if we do get a Nintendo Direct.

I know a lot of people are like 3D Mario. I not I'm not there. Uh but um I do think they probably have like one more thing for this holiday and then they could set up the early part of 2026. I I wouldn't be surprised if that's exactly how it goes down. Yeah. I mean I I at this point would be be just because I am so fascinated by Donkey Kong's July release date. That feels like such a bizarre choice for them where it's obviously launch window, but having Mario Kart at launch and then a month later putting out this game that we still don't know what team's working on it, but like all signs point to the Odyssey team, right?

And uh it being not $80 and coming out just a month after the the console. Something about that to me feels off. And Nintendo's weird. They've done things differently always. But uh then looking past that, it's like we have Metroid Prime 4. Like I would assume that's going to be their big push fall game. Uh because we still don't have a date for them. Feels like it, right? Yeah, it feels like it. Yeah. I just don't know what space we have for a a big Nintendo game later in the year cuz like we also have all the third parties and all like we have a Call of Duty, right? That's going to be the Switch. There's the Zelda um Warriors game again. There's a new one of those. Uh so yeah, they they do have games that they have to find a slot",

Yeah, they James in the chat says Pokemon Zah. Yeah, like that's Pokemon. Yes, that's probably actually the November game for sure. I think that Zelda game's 2026. I could be wrong. Is it 2020? I think so. I think so. But and yeah, uh Kirby the um with the starcrossed world or whatever like that that still doesn't have a date either. I I think we pretty much know.

Uh and then yeah, Air Riders, which I don't know if that's going to be this year either. Uh, I can't like I I feel like that one was supposed to be this year. Yeah. Did it. Barrett's saying he thinks it was slated for this year. All right. Oh, it is list 25. Interesting. All right. All right, then. Yeah, that's going to be a small little fun thing, though.
