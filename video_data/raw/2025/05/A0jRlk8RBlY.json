Here we are in the 70s. A young boy so brilliant he dazzled all those he came into contact with. We're doing what I tell you. He was a born entertainer as he discovered the power of video games. It's the Royal Rumble on Genesis. Oh, thank you. He found a way to harness that same power for good, changing the lives of millions with his infectious passion and drive. That boy had become a man. That man had become an icon. And that icon would one day interview some guy called Greg Miller at PAX East for some reason. It was a sideways move for sure, but the icon in question, Ben Star, that's who we were talking about, really enjoyed doing charity work. And Greg Miller seemed like he really needed the exposure.

Cool things certainly cooler than this in his real job. Acting and moving millions. Like in the modern masterpiece Clare obscure expedition 33, not like Smelly Greg, who by the looks of things was really quite poor. Obviously, we don't completely know his financial situation, but it was, you know, just sort of a hunch. You can see it in his sad eyes. So, please welcome to the stage one of the most dynamic entertainers in the video game industry, Ben Star, and the guy he's been asked to babysit for an hour, Greg Miller. [Music] Hello. How are you?

I remember distinctly after I graduated Missou with the journalism degree and EGM, OneUp, IGN, nobody would touch me with a 10-ft pole.

He's like, \"Mailer, congratulations on the job.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, thanks so much.\" And his second his first question, I guess, was how does this get you closer to writing about video games? Yeah.

We would go do these panels, Damon and I, and do these meet and greets where we're like 10 people show up and then suddenly we're in trouble with the bar because 100 people did and we didn't book anything.

You also said you also said in that review, I remember you said a masterpiece doesn't mean it's perfect. And I think that's which was a struggle for a long time at IGN and still is obviously in the space when you How do you how do you juggle that like um review scores? What do you think of them? I think they're great. I think they serve a purpose. I think people take them far too seriously. Yeah. I think that is like to this day still such a problem of we live in a golden age and I know I'm saying this while many of the pillars fall down around us of video game criticism, right?

But it's like you can go and find it and like, well, I found this person who was over on TikTok who plays the kind of games I like. So their opinion about this thing that I normally wouldn't play means more than the blanket IGN. It's a seven, it's a 10, it's a whatever. And so I think, you know, review scores need to be looked through that lens, but people just want to fight all the time. And there's so many more big things for us to fight about than this. But they do. They do. Like, um, this isn't a nine. This is a seven. What does a seven even mean? Yeah. But like I think that you know what kind of funny you really juggled around review scores.

Well, I didn't say it doesn't mean anything. All right. That's not what I said. I think review scores in any shape or form facilitate discussions. Yeah. When we were adamant about not doing review scores when we started kind of funny, it was very much the hangover of IGN. It was we're sick of fighting. We're sick of people in the comments coming in and saying that it isn't a nine, it isn't this, blah blah blah. And so we thought by removing them, we would remove that level of commenter. Yeah.

We're all trying to figure out how we feel about review scores in games. But let's go to a big point in your career. Okay. The one that's I mentioned in the video 2015. I got it. Get it up.

And you said, \"Yes, but I it doesn't it isn't as conceited as it sounds.\" Uh, it was the idea that, as I already have talked about, I'll toss it back to y'all. It's because of you. If you remember and as u uh uh you're about to hear Sean Leaden call out that this was voted on by the fans and this was a public vote. So when we were drive I mean remember this is 2015.

So, it was literally we could see the percentages and I was always way ahead because nobody was paying attention. And then day of I was like I think I landed and I checked my phone and it was on maybe the kind of funny message board or I don't think we had a Reddit yet. Maybe we did. somewhere there was a Jeff just did a live stream and that somebody asked if Greg's still winning and he said he believes he is and so I was completely prepared for it not to happen but I thought that we had the numbers as long as nobody woke up to it and the epilogue to that is that years later at a VidCon I",

And so when we launch January 5th, 2015 and it is a runaway success and it it blows past all of our expectations and we're invited to go on GameSpot the next day, which doesn't sound crazy today, but back then and IGN person on GameSpot uh and you know I I was looking through I was deleting you know we're getting ready to take off but you can't do any of the fun stuff yet.

And, you know, she's, uh, what, 19, 20 now? She's living in Chicago. She's going to university. And I brought her on specifically to talk about what was it like to grow up in front of a camera in this company called Rooster Teeth and have this relationship and da da da. and she gave a lot of feedback and a lot of interesting stories and stuff to it, but it lines up with what Jen and I have been doing of like it's going to be his choice what he wants.

I want him to have agency of what he's doing. So when he walks, he's watching right now. Yeah, he might still be watching. Might be on his way to preschool. Uh but it's that idea of like he has that agency to be a part of it. I don't ever want Ben to be a prop. I don't want Ben to be, \"All right, go come on.

I'm sure the same way my father daydreamed about me coming out and changing the oil on his car, I daydream about when the the video game he cares about comes out and he we take him off school and he comes in and streams with us or plays with us or the first time we go to a preview event together and he actually has something to say about it. like I do, but I'm never going to force that on him. That'll be an idea I want him to know is available to him, but not a pressure.

There was no script. There was no whatever. You would just talk and they would edit together. I forget which Uncharted it was. Maybe it was even just a preview. But at the end, I was like, maybe it wasn't even Uncharted, but it was something to the effect at the end. I was like, uh, if you want to know more about Desolate Wastelands or uh, paramilitary zones or what, something horrible like that, Google Detroit. And for everything about video games, go to IGN.com.
