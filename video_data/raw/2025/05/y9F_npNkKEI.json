I am joined today by you know him from game ranks and before you buy and the friends per second podcast and just being one of my favorite people on the internet. It's Jake Baldino. Hello boys.

I've met Jake a million times. I know Jake very, very well. Uh, but I met you for the first time in Los Angeles. And immediately I'm like, I [\u00a0__\u00a0] love this guy. This is my guy.

St. It's literally been the week of Tim. That's exactly it. I love it. I'm so excited. I'm very excited to have this group of gentlemen here to talk about uh one of my favorite things in life, Tony Hawks Pros Skater. Uh the three of us, as well as a handful of other people, got to go down to Los Angeles and play Tony Hawks Pros Skater 3 and 4 remake um by Iron Galaxy. We got to play for a couple hours and then in addition to that, we just had a kind of wild week. They they they get gave us tickets to THPS Fest, uh which was essentially a insane concert of a bunch of the the bands and artists featured in the Tony Hawk games.

Today, we're brought to you by Shady Rays, R of Frames, and Rocket Money, but we'll tell you all about that later. We got to get into the topic of the show. Tots, before we get into Tony Hawk, though, there's something else I want to bring up. This is not sponsored. We have in the past been sponsored by XReal AR Glasses.

I'm using the competitor one, the Ver glasses. Essentially, either way, they are glasses. They look like I guess you call them like Ray-B bands, like wayfairers, right? Pretty standard sunglass model. But it has a screen in it. And that screen technically acts as a display. So, an external display to anything you plug it into USBC into your phone, your laptop, your Switch, or most importantly, uh, a Roger Ally or a Steam Deck, which really, really changes the game, man. Right? Like, I feel like now all of a sudden I can like on a train, on a plane, anywhere, I can get gaming really good cuz I mean like handheld portable gaming, we all do it. It's great. But after a while, you get fatigued. And I know this sounds like an ad, but I swear to God, it's not. It's literally just old man complaining. You get fatigued. And now, like",

But if you have these things on your face, you can have it plugged into your Steam Deck and you just look straight ahead and you have a giant TV screen. So, I've been able to just like completely go balls deep on flights into games. And that's it's probably not the right phrase. Sorry. But hey, it's right though, man. No, real talk though. This is uh one of those things where for years we've had XR real used many of the different iterations as they've kind of uh uh advanced and you know infamously the Kevin stories of him being addicted to these things.

Uh so for me it's like I wanted to wait till it had less of a a gimmick need and more of an actual use case need for me personally. And um I've been going on a lot of trips recently, whether it was to New York for the Switch 2 event or Wrestlemania or down to LA for this Tony Hawk thing. And a lot of those times I was trying to play games for review. So I was trying to play Expedition 33. I forget what the other ones were, but I was like, I'm on the Steam Deck. I want to give these things a shot cuz why not? I'm going to be on a like 8 hour flight or whatever it was to New York on the way back. So let's see what this is all about.

I thought, \"Oh, I'm going to have to connect it to like a a power brick or like something to then connect. There's just going to be too many cables and dongles and stuff.\" I also thought that it was going to just not look that good or whatever. And here I am now blown. I am a convert full on for these things. Like I just want to show you guys how easy this is. It is one USBC cable, not even proprietary. It's just a USBC cable that goes onto these glasses and it plugs in to whatever device you want. It could be your phone, it could be your Steam Deck, like anything that has USBC and you plug it in and it powers from the device.

Like there's an OLED screen in there. And like do these look like perfectly Ray-B band glasses? No. But they're pretty damn close. He's so cool. To the point to the point that for me, I like that they don't clearly look just like real glasses. Cuz when I'm sitting on the plane, I don't want to be like a weirdo that's sitting there like uh you know, like first off, I don't want the big ass headset, right? Cuz then you're too weird. But this at least there's a cable coming down. They know something's going on. Also, I can see you right now while there's a big screen in front of me. Here's the thing.

I am blown away by how amazing they are. Um and they they're just they it's here, guys. Like the time is now. These things are awesome. We've arrived. It's at a good point. They figured it out. Like I feel like now the fun stuff happens where it's like over time the form factor will only get better. The price will start to go down cuz I think the price is still a little high. I just think like if you're someone that sits around a lot or you travel a lot or or anything, it's good cuz it's like you fit it in a sunglass case, throw it in your bag and then you're good.

So much better than having a giant $3,000 computer strapped to your face made out of glass. You can just wear cool sunglasses that make you look cool and then you can Yeah, that's looking at them in person. It's baffling how sleek and I I am so damn impressed with these things. Yeah. The reason I'm bringing up now is cuz me and Jake were having breakfast and we're just talking about it and we're talking about traveling a lot and I was like, \"Dude, I have a device that's going to change your life.\" And he was just like, \"Are they like AR glasses?\" I'm like, \"What the hell?

We're talking about Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3+ 4. Uh, we all got to play so much of it. I want top level thoughts. Actually, first off, what's your history with the Tony Hawk franchise, Ste? Uh, I started with Tony Hawk's Underground 2, actually, so probably the ziest entry in the franchise. Um, claps for that. Thank you. Uh, and and then went actually went back and, uh, have played all of them uh, and up to one and two remake and now three and four remake and I love them.

It's the most small world how did this happen [\u00a0__\u00a0] I've ever experienced. What? It's insane. It's like it's all also the fact that you're wearing a Metal Gear shirt and for once I'm not. Yeah. It's like crazy. We're just like time warping. This is weird. This is so funny. So, okay. You started with Tony Hawk 1 on the N64. That beautiful cartridge. Yeah. And I uh then I loved it.

The GBA, the isometric stuff, those were great. It was pretty, you know. Yeah, to be fair, it was kind of cool. But yeah, I I've been there from the beginning and uh I've I've really enjoyed all of them because it's like the one game I'm capable at. I wouldn't say I'm like prolevel at, but it's the one game where like I feel like I can sit down and like maybe beat my friends, you know, and that that's that's been something.

Um, it's just it's such an important franchise to me for so many reasons. Like right up there with Metal Gear and Max Payne, but this is just a random sports game dropped in there. Yeah, I mean, I'm I'm right there with you. I don't need to go too long. The people listening know my history with this, but I also started with Tony 1 on the N64, became absolutely addicted after that and would 100% each and every entry after. right there with Jake where I played far too long uh past the quality of the original Never Soft titles kind of dipping but still find a lot of love even if you know uh",

It really wasn't great, but it wasn't the worst thing ever. And then Five really was the worst thing of all time. So, when One and Two came out, it it kind of blew my mind.

And so to continue that with three and four, I have been incredibly excited to play through this stuff. So now I want to get into initial impressions of what we got to play. Jake, let's start with you. Yeah. Yeah. I think top level uh really really enjoyed it. It plays exactly like I expected it to. Uh then the levels are recreated well like in one and two but actually feel like a little bit more uh like a lot more particle effects, a lot more like just crazy [\u00a0__\u00a0] going on.

Uh the only thing is I still kind of have questions about the career mode. The lack of career mode is something that I think is a point of contention. If you look at comments, right, everybody's talking about it, and I do find myself going back and forth, having played original four so much. There are a lot of duds within that career mode, and what they've done here is kind of tried to just match four to feel like three as a cohesive package. I get it from a philosophy standpoint sometimes. Some people think it's them cutting corners. I don't know if it is, but I do think I miss some of the objectives from career mode more than the career mode structure itself. Some of the object objectives and like the the rapid pace weird stuff I I am going to miss. There is some of that like flavor-wise, right? like some of the objectives or the goals",

This is called these are called Tony Hawk 3 and four remastered technically is what they call them. It's just 3 plus 4. 3+ 4. Yeah. So, I still look at it as like a a representation or a preservation or of the originals. And I do feel like for the sake of it being complete, I think I would have ultimately liked more career stuff.

I do personally love the the twominut timer uh and how the goals are more streamlined to fit that two-minute timer. And you can now uh set the timer up to 60 minutes, which I think is a good compromise for people to be able to take, you know, the levels at their own pace, see what's happening, uh complete the goals as they will, um but not have the career motives, uh specifically, which I understand is a point of contention again, like NPC dialogue is so iconic, like all of that stuff.

So it was cool cool to actually meet him and he was a super cool guy and like getting his takes on everything was also like very fun. But yeah, he he's legit good. Yeah. knows what he's doing. Credit to his uh his coverage, too. Uh it's it's very in-depth. Like he gets very granular. So, if you're so into Tony Hawk where you you you care about the extremely minute details, he's done a lot of good coverage that's",

His interviews were great, too. So, yeah, if you want more, highly recommend his stuff. Absolutely. Very very very cool. Andy THPS, check that out. Um, Stake Stakes Animation says, \"Do we know more about the secret Spongebob area?\" Oh. Um, yes and no. We didn't we didn't get to play the Skater Island level in um the the preview we did, but we did see that it's there. Like there there was a image that clearly was Skater Island. The Spongebob secret area isn't going to be a secret area like that. Like what we saw in that Switch trailer, that's going to be it. Like if you remember in the original Tony Hawk 3, you could jump off the pirate ship and you kind of go into this like area, but it kind of just resets you back.",

Like it's like just a quick little Easter egg, but now the Easter egg Spongebob instead of like whatever the hell it was before, like a shark or whatever. Yeah. Davy Jones lock or whatever. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Um we're about to wrap up here. Is there any final things you guys want to say about our experience? No, I just had a great time. I was really not I was expecting something baseline good, but it came away with it much more excited than I expected to be, I think. Um, and yeah, I'm excited to play when it comes out in July. Yeah, Jake. Yeah, I think I'm excited to see, you know, if there are more career goals, like stuff like that kind of addressed, but otherwise, like it it I love going into a game preview where I'm like, \"Oh, okay. This is exactly what I was expecting. This is good.\" uh",

Uh and then it's just launch Iron Galaxy. The Iron Galaxy has had a couple of little fumbles in the past, so I hope that doesn't happen with this, but so far, uh, all sign all signs are pointing to it being a pretty good representation of the original game, despite a couple little complaints here and there. So, honestly, it's going to be the same thing. I'm a sucker. I'm going to buy it on my PlayStation, and then I'm going to be like, \"Oh, I want it on Steam Deck.\" And I'm going to buy it there, and then",

I'm a sucker. It's just how it it goes. But it's my testament to like me loving these games and the fact that it feels like three and four and I'm already predicting that I'm going to have it on all my devices. That's a win.
