It's having a nice little entrance to the the summer blockbusters, you know what I mean? The gym's getting ready for the essentially backtoback weeks. I feel like they might have already started uh of just big ass sequels to franchises. So, yeah. interview is about to be popping off everybody and that Jib's just gonna be very happy about it.

This is officially The Karate Kid Legends in review, but due to timing and scheduling and how the years worked, we never actually reviewed The Karate Kid 2010 with Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan. We never thought because originally we're going the Miyagi verse is what we were reviewing. We never could have comprehended in our silly little minds Andy that it all was the Miyagi verse until Legends and now like well we got to go back. But we're just going to halfass it. This one was like we're running out of time. So it's optional homework for people to watch Karate Kid 2010. Who here watched it? Raised your hand. [\u00a0__\u00a0] no. Everyone except Andy Cortez.

I need a picture of both of us as Lurch and I was I don't know why it really just feels like the biggest like bargain bin discount thing of like let's get two of those costumes. I don't even remember loving Adam's family a whole lot as a kid either, but like we were both lurch and we both had our faces painted like zombies. I don't know if we've seen a picture of this dude.

Uh the budget of this one was $45 million. Um and then going to Karate Kid 2010, it was just called The Karate Kid. It had a run time of two hours and 20 minutes. It was egregious. Why was No Karate Kid movie ever should be around two hours? Wait, Legends was an hour and a half. Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] Okay.

Um let's start with Karate Kid 2010. Uh Joey, overall thoughts? Honestly, not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It definitely felt like 2 hours and 20 minutes, but I wasn't necessarily mad about it. I liked it overall. The thing that I will that will stick with me about this movie is the insane music that they use in this. Can we talk about it? Well, I don't really care if we can. I'm going to. Okay.

It does like Crazy Rich Asians. The Gorilla's cover. There's the gorillas uh remix that it's just dirty hairy, but it's the Hong Kong version. Like that's kind of cool. Then we have Say What You Need to Say by John Mayer, which is a wild tone. Baby, I'm Back by Baby Bash and Acon, Low by Flow Rider, Poker Face by Lady Gaga, and then it ends with Never Say Never by Justin Bieber, and then Tim blew my mind letting me know that Jaden has a verse on it, which I didn't remember, and that it was made for this movie.

Kind of knocked it out of the park whenever his dad put in a movie. Yeah, he would have. Uh, and it didn't it at the same time did feel as long as it was and didn't. I think Jackie Chan did like a fairly good job. I also don't have like a ton of experience with him, so it's kind of my first one. I do think it's weird that it's not really about karate. Yeah. Well, I mean, that's something we should talk about, right? That's like the weirdest part of the movie, but other than that, I was expecting like real bad and this was surprisingly competent.

I remember watching it the first time thinking, you know, it's pretty it's a fairly competent movie and it's a it's a good remake for all intents and purposes of The Karate Kid. Um, the choreography is way better, the fighting is way better. Jackie Chan is really fun to watch always cuz he's Jackie Chan and I think he has great chemistry with Jaden Smith who I think is good in this movie, but after two hours of it, you walk away going, \"Ah, there just was something lacking in that.\" that movies of similar ilk, like the fish out of water story of",

Um, those movies just have a magic to them that this one just didn't have in there. And I don't know quite why that is. I think Jackie Chan does a great job, especially in these really emotional moments where he's, you know, where when things happen and he's talking about stuff. It's so we have all those beats that are supposed to be there. Uh, and I think Jaden Smith, I think they could have literally built a franchise out of this. I just think it's lacking that one thing that made you want to come back to this world. Um, so not necessarily a waste of a film, but a missed opportunity.

Like I thought that there was no way this was good and everything I've ever heard about it kind of been that vibe. It wasn't that at all. This is a movie. Like there's uh a couple times on interview I'm surprised by how much of like a movie the things we watch are cuz sometimes it's just like it just feels like content.

Um, and I I feel like it's a story that is timeless and no matter how many times you tell it, it's going to kind of hit if you just do all the things you need to do. And I think this did all the things. It took way too long to do them. But I think at the end of the day, I forgive that because Jackie Chan's [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome. And I didn't expect the Jackie Chan factor to affect this film. I thought he was just going to be okay cool. He's more of the the sefue Yoda type of just telling him things. Wax on, wax off.

And it's that Jackie Chan kind of prop comedy fighting. Unbelievably good. That's why you watch John Wick movies. Abs. Absolutely. It's there's something special about that. And yo, shout out to Jaden Smith. I did not ever think that this kid had this stuff. He 12-year-old Jaden Smith. Good. Kind of great, man. Love it. Uh the bad guy made me laugh so bad. Like the the little the the the bullies in this movie. Maybe the the the greatest worst squad of bullies I've ever seen.

I think that might be one of the one of the things that draws me out of it though and I don't know what it is but they just they just read all of them so young that when they do violence I'm like ah there's something wrong here and the choreography is almost too good. One of the things I like so much about going back and watching the Karate Kid is that he doesn't learn karate and that he masters it. He just learns enough to score points on Johnny and win because it's not about learning karate. It's about overcoming your fear and like doing the thing to prove to someone you to prove that you're good at something. It's about winning the tournament basically and by by proxy of winning the tournament. You're, you know, you're overcoming this wow you're overcoming this fear basically",

I had fun sitting next to Andy laughing at these moments that just kind of came out of left field across the board. Um, to speak positively about it, I liked the two leads. I thought they had great chemistry together. I think um I'm going to say that his name here because I brought it up. Uh, Ben Wang is phenomenal. At at one point, and this is a bit of a spoiler, but there is a nod to uh him running around New York and discovering that and sort of doing heroic things.

But you see Johnny, you see him with the Kors banquet and you're like the everything he said, the way they shot it, I'm like, this feels like they're like, \"All right, we're going to make a sequel and it's going to be Copraker Kai.\" And that got me hyped as hell.

I'm like this is awesome. Like what a great flip of all of this. And I feel like that was totally not something I expect from watching the trailers from this. In fact, I feel like the trailer trailers are fairly misleading for what this movie is. Like you could take Daniel Laruso out of it entirely. It'd probably be a better movie. Some would argue that they should have taken Daniel Russo out of this entirely. And that's that's a that's a that's a big issue I have with it is that, you know, off the rip they're like, we're, you know, we're moving from from Beijing to the to America.

Jackie Ch just take a quick flight out across the country when they have 10 days to train for this thing and go recruit John Daniel Russo, who's then going to come a day late. So you figure he's got three days to train him on. None of this makes any sense. From Beijing to New York, then New York to California, then California back to New That's that's awful. That's awful.

This movie was a bit more grounded than that. And in fact, the things that I liked about the movie were the grounded moments. I like when he walks into the pizza joint. I like when they call him stuffed crust. I like that. Really, at the end of the day, there's a really good movie here about a kid from Beijing who moves to New York and has culture shock and then gets basically shown around by the, you know, a native Italian, I guess. I assume, uh, cuz they run a pizza joint. Maybe I'm being, maybe I'm reading too much in that, but like I love that story. I love the story of because now I'm thinking I'm like, he's Joshua Jackson.

Maybe it was an Irish guy. I don't know. All long story short is I like that component of this. And when you have those moments where it really is kind of feeling like an indie film of a kid running around and on the scooter and she's showing him around and all this stuff, that's great. And then you have the melodramatic moments that I think are just in stark contrast.

You're skipping the Karate Kid 2 flashbacks, the explanation of the Miyagi and my families. So, a long time ago in a galaxy far far away, they made a movie called The Karate Kid in 2010, right?

They're doing kung fu, which is a traditional martial art of China.\" He says it a little more shitty like a 12-year-old would, but it gets the point across. That's the one piece of exposition anyone in the in the theater needed to be like, I guess I'll just excuse the fact that karate has nothing to do with this movie at all.

Um, as you probably have noted in the last hour and a half. Uh, but I hope it does well because I the five seconds that they were sharing the screen again, it I want that forever. I just want these guy I want Zapka to have a career forever. I just want them all these two guys to just do more of of of Karate Kid and continue iterate it. So, if this is the Fast and Furious 4 that gets us to five and six, I would be okay with that. I can't believe Jaden Smith wasn't in this movie at all.

So, it is all canon. But I can't believe he wasn't here. I know he's not acting anymore, but like a cameo or something. Well, you imagine Dre is still in Beijing, right? still training with Jackie Chan probably for sure I thought there was gonna be a moment where he's like hey man have a good like you know you'll love New York or whatever that's where I'm from or actually I think they were from Detroit but still you're right yeah but maybe well they got to go here's what we got to do we got to we got to start a campaign for Will Smith to get involved in the next one so we can cast Jaden and",

Tim, take it away. So, here we are. Uh, we have four movies currently that we have bad guys for. We need to slide in Karate Kid 2010 and Karate Kid Legends. At number one, we have Terry Silver, Crease, and Mike Barnes from Karate Kid 3. We have Johnny Lawrence and Crease from Karate Kid 1. We have Chosen and Seaitto in Karate Kid 2. And then we have Dugan and Ned from the next Karate Kid. Walter Gogggins.

I think in terms of sheer martial arts quality, I'd put this guy pretty high, but uh it it's it was just a little too bare bones. Uh, and I don't think that we'd actually truly stand by it if we had to watch them back to back, Andy, of like if we watched Next Karate Kid last week, I think we would have been like, they're below this. But, but I'm with you because the this is a vibes thing. How iconic them coming down in the gym was, I'll never forget. This guy would be I mean, this squad would be a lot higher if the dad and the kid were even more assholeish, but they were just like they just kind of barely hit the threshold.

It's definitely above these the mob of these young kids that were like very good at fighting and the their teacher being [\u00a0__\u00a0] pure evil and then the moment that that the kid gets beat, all of the kids turn on the their seue. I thought that was awesome. But I mean I I would put them at uh number three uh underneath Swank above Chosen and Silto from I wouldn't put him above Chosen and Saito. All right. Well, there's all that back there's all that backstory with Silto and and and and Mr. Miyagi. I mean, there is at least back whatever. Yeah, whatever. Um All right. So, there we go. Karate Kid 2010.

Karate Kid 2 not that good. Yes, but neither was this. This was just sort of derivative. It was It's It's got all the makings of a good movie, but I would much rather watch The Karate Kid 2 right now than that movie ever again. It's him and it's him in Japan.

Although they found a good fun dimension of having him actually train with Harry Silver. Um again if I had watched Karate Kid 2 last week and then this maybe I would feel differently but I have such a soft spot in in my heart for Karate Kid part two specifically for the soundtrack that I can't put anything above it. Like a night in shining armor. I'm with Nick, but from a long time ago from I just I love Karate Kid, Joey. I I'm on your side. Okay. I don't think I would put it above two. I put it below two.

I do love that movie, but I I'm an adult enough to understand it's probably not has not held up well. So, now it's time to rank Karate Kid Legends. Uh we put Karate Kid 2010 at fourth place, uh with only the next Karate Kid behind it. Andy, where would you put Legends? Legends for me would be above the next Karate Kid and I can't really base it against the 2010 one because but it would be fourth. It would it would be below the OG three for sure. I put it above two.
