I'm doing really well. Uh, this one's going to be a treat. You and I and Nvidia have teamed up with Kind of Funny, and we've gotten to showcase a lot of awesome games using DLSS4 and the awesome technology behind the 50 series um, GPUs. And what's exciting now is we get to go to Cyberpunk, a game that you really love. I do. I'm so ready for it. And I haven't really experienced. So, I I get a double win for me.

Of course, don't forget frames win games. And we also want to have on Nvidia Reflex, probably located down at the bottom to get you the very best. We have DLSS frame generation on here. Uh we got a multiplier of two. We can probably kick that up to four if you want. Have some fun with that. Okay. Uh RA tracing is full on right now and our crowd density is on high. Filter view is 90.

In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith, accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams.
