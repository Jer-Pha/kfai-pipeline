You get the best of all these world worlds because of Nvidia. And we're sponsored today by Nvidia. It's my favorite thing when Nvidia is like, \"Hey, do you all want to play that sick ass game with all of our sick ass tech?\" And we said, we said, \"Sick ass.\" Yeah, that sounds great. That sounds great to us. Uh, and this is a game that Nick's been looking forward to. So, what a perfect joining of all the worlds, just like the joining of the tripod, the visual triangle, visuals, frame rate, resolution. I never do it in the right order. Um, I'm super pumped to be here, Nick, because you get to see something that you don't get to see when you go home. You get to see the power of the Nvidia 5090, the RTX 5090.

I wasn't blessing and Roger like I wasn't too blown away by the visual quality like I don't know it looked good but you know don't get me wrong it just it was nothing special and then I showed him the game on PC and he was like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh I didn't I didn't know it was like that.

It's so smooth. I tried it out a bunch earlier. It feels so freaking incredible. Uh, and uh, the big one, Nick, is multiframe generation. Yes. And that's what I'm excited about to see today. Multiframe generation is huge. Uh so I'd love to show you how to turn all this on because we're going to be playing Doom: The Dark Ages, okay, with full rate tracing at the full power that we got along with um along with frame generation.

We'll leave it on quality mode since we have a 1440p monitor. Usually, if you have a 4K monitor, you might want to go down to performance mode to get more frames. Uh, but we're on a 1440p, so quality is usually pretty good for us. Or balance is a good option for y'all as well. Got it. And what I want you to do is turn on DLSS frame generation. And let's do two. You can go up to four, which is insane. If you go up to four, hit four time. Okay. And then uh uh hit the R button to apply.
