We've told you all how important it is to developers to wishlist games that you're interested in. So, if this sounds cool to you, make sure you wishlist it. Imperial is a complex, featurerich action RPG where you'll be sent to a planet in a far-off corner of the galaxy to explore an imposing monolith. As an elite mercenary, you'll join the expedition tasked with unearthing the secrets of the monolith and face off against the deadly automatons within. In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith, accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams. Each cardgram affects which enemies, boss fights, and loot will appear when you",

Each cardgram affects which enemies, boss fights, and loot will appear when you enter the monolith, so no two excursions will be the same. Find even more cardoggrams to explore by looting defeated enemies or buy them from other players online at the trading post. Imperial features three weapon archetypes. The fast-paced acrobatic glaive, the defense focused mason shield, or the devastating cannon with a range of customizable skills and abilities that can make short work of the awaiting automatons. Your weapons and abilities can be changed before any excursion into a cardoggram. So, if a loadout isn't working for you, you can mix things up to create the perfect play style.

Yeah, I think with where they're at now, like with the new the Game Pass conversation, I think was what was relevant when we were talking TVs and the and Xbox wasn't like as third party now as it is in terms of software. Now that that's the case, I don't think we see Game Pass on Switch.

Um and Barrett, you can you're you're up to this up on this too, right? Like do we know how many chapters total he's going for here? Um I I'm confused now too cuz I thought it was seven. Um because the way the story is uh framed in each of these chapters, it's one day uh throughout an entire week. Um but then I've been hearing other reports that there's only four chapters, but I don't I don't think that's the case. I think there's supposed to be a total of seven. Yeah, everybody in chat is",

Yeah, everybody in chat is saying saying seven as well. So like this will get us over the halfway point. Thank god uh of Delta and each of these chapters are like four to five hours each. Best thing is each of these chapter like when you talk about Undertale the the original game Undertale was probably like a five to eight hour game and so like you're essentially getting sequels to Undertale here. Uh and chapter chapters one and two felt like full experiences and so like you're getting two more chapters which are going to be hopefully two more full experiences of what's going on um in this story. So for me and I'm and for Bear and for the Delta Rune audience like this is going to be a big deal.

That's one that I want to boot up and just run around for a good 10 minutes just like you know experience it hopefully in better uh um better resolution or just better uh visuals. Uh, but outside of that, right, like, you know, maybe I'll pick up Socalibur 2. Maybe I check out Welcome Tour because like some of the some of the things we saw in the previews looked kind of interesting as far as like what those mini gamess are, but that's not going to be like a big time waster for me.

Um, where's what about the the like dragon dragon drive? Is that not launch? No. When is that coming out? I don't think they put a date on it and I think it was 2025, but like I don't think we know much more than that. Is a month till Donkey Kong. Is that right? July is Donkey Kong. Yeah. And Kirby, I think was August. So maybe September for Dragon Drive. I thought for sure that was a launch title. Uh, yeah.

Um Fast Fusion, I don't remember what that is. Is that part of That's the fast RMX game. Oh, you're right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Hitman: World of Assassination Signature Edition. Oh, you know what? I might boot that up for a little bit. I don't expect it to be like that much new content, so I don't know how much I'm going to play it. Uh, cuz I think I just rather play on PS5, but I'll boot that up just to check it out.

I think I once blessing brought up the issue of time, I was like, \"Oh, fuck.\" Actually, that's a great point because this will be, you know, still a week or two after Night Rain comes out or whenever that like there's just so many other large titles around three weeks before Death Stranding 2.

There's like other things that I kind of want to check out like Dune Awakening and like other games in that realm. Uh FPC Firebreak is in June as well. Like June is just a big month for video games. It'd be one thing if I owned a lot of these games already. This isn't, you know, this isn't similar to getting the PS5 Pro and going, \"Oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] let me boot up all those other games I already owned on PS5.

That's why for me it's like most of them are the Nintendo games, right, that are getting some type of free things. So, I'm excited to pop around there. But, yeah, for me it's Mario Kart World, um the enhanced editions of Breath and Tears and then Welcome Tour. But, uh the Gamecube stuff is like what I'm next in line most excited for, specifically F-Zero GX. Like, I've never beat the single player in it cuz it was incredibly difficult and I've been waiting for somehow Nintendo to re-release it.

That bothers me and I wish it was the, uh, Wii port, but I'm excited that the original is here as well. I just feel like this isn't how I want to replay Wind Waker. Uh, question for Greg. In terms of GameCube games, uh, obviously they'll get to eventually uh, Double Dash. Is that is that one you go back to and prioritize over Mario Kart World whenever it comes? Um, no. I mean, I'll stick with World. I imagine it'll be a better game. For me, you know, as somebody with limited Nintendo nostalgia, all the virtual console stuff is always, oh, I'm going to pop in here, check it out. No, that's cool. And then I bounce out.

What was it? Toad stool tour here, right? Yeah, it was to stool tour. Yeah, I'm definitely going to go do the exact same thing I'm talking about of try it out for a little bit and then bounce off. But yeah, my launch will be dominated by world. I imagine when I'm out of that, it'll be playing uh probably Zelda. Whether it's Tears or it is Links Awakening is to be decided. And then yeah, I'll be back to that back to that Mario Kart. Uh Bert on the chat says, \"I wonder if the Pokemon games are cool.
