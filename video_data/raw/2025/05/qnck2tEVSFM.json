I want to get your thoughts on this, but you put a note here. Yeah. Uh I want to make this required viewing. Uh yesterday Alana Pierce put up a video on her YouTube channel um called the video game industry is screwed. Uh and I watched this yesterday and it was a very very good watch.

And she's taken all the information that she's learned, put it into a 20-minute video, and kind of just talked about her findings. And I think the timing of this video is really good going into the news that we have today because I think it provides a lot of context into what's been going on in the last couple years with all the layoffs, everything's going everything going on, but then also with prices going up and you know, us feeling in this place of man, the video games industry seems [\u00a0__\u00a0] And she makes a lot of points.

It's like the fact that it's a maturing industry, right? It's the fact of in from like this is from Alana, right? From like 2010ish to about 2021, there was meteoric growth in the numbers of how much money video games were bringing in. And then around the time of like 2022, you saw those numbers dip in a way that saw a lot of shareholders pull out, right? From 2010 to 2021, everybody was investing in video games. Oh man, there's so much money here. And I mean, you say esports, right? It was everything, right? Fortnite, like video games in general, honestly, like there was such a rise in terms of how many people were were jumping in to invest or at least how much money was coming in on the investment side because there was a lot of",

That's why you see things like risk. That's why you see see things like, you know, uh, uh, uh, games that aren't necessarily the live service things, the things that are that have to to be money makers getting funded because you had the space to try things out and maybe fail and try another thing out, right? And like figure out how to turn that into a success. after you see that dip and shareholders and everybody start to pull out and put their money into other things like AI or whatever else is, you know, like whatever else is seeing that upward trajectory, that's where you're seeing these companies tighten up their pockets and go, \"Oh, we we don't have space for risk.

Yeah, I I do think again I was saying that like trying to find the the bright spots here and you saying that you know we can talk all we want about the live service games is not really going to affect things and like that is true like they need to just fail and then the companies need to not make money and over and over again eventually they'll uh shift things but I do think that it is very important for us to really really really give props to the the games that are succeeding this year like when we see how well expedition 33 is doing and it's like that's awesome you know blueprints um it's doing so I think we're live again.

We're like, I don't think this is going to work. It could.

There's no other way to look at it and it's like you know people are going to get priced out of games. Like that is just a fact. It's not a uh a fear tactic of people saying that. It's like there are going to be people that cannot buy Mario Kart because it's $80 instead of 70 because 70 was already too much for them. And there's people that couldn't buy it at 70 cuz they 60 was their top and people that 50 was their top.
