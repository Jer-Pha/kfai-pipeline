Resolution, how sharp does it look? With the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, with Nvidia DLSS 4, it's all possible. You get all worlds combined. You don't got to sacrifice one of them. If you want your game to run in 4K, you don't got to put your game on low settings. If you want your game to be getting 900 frames per second, you don't got to freaking, you know, run your game in 480p. You don't got to sacrifice. With Nvidia DLSS4, everything is possible. And today, we're showing off Nvidia DLSS4 with more Doom: The Dark Ages. We're returning to our playthrough from yesterday. Nick is pumped. The game rocks. There was so many cool moments. The game looks amazing. And um Nick, go ahead and uh you got the menu up right now. Yesterday we were able to run everything flawlessly in ultraviolence mode. Yes, we were, Andy.

And it's very, very excited to be back in the Doom world. Where are we at right now? Do we Okay. Yeah, we're good to go. We got quality. We have frame generation on a two because we only have a 2K monitor. Uh so we don't want to waste those frames cuz we can't utilize them. Well, we're only Yeah, the monitor gets 165 hertz, which was the frame rate, you know, jacks you up to like 200 frames per second anyway. when we had four times on when you go to DLSS frame generation, DLSS deep learning super sampling uses AI to not only recreate the image of your game to make it run better. It's really hard to make games run really smoothly at 4K with running with the most insane visual uh settings possible. So DLSS will drop down the resolution of the game down to 900p or 1080p or 1200p and then uses AI to recreate that image to make",

And then with DLSS frame generation uses Nvidia's AI, their deep learning super sampling to put frames in between frames where there weren't uh frames to begin with. So instead of getting 90 frames per second, now we're looking at 150, 160, 170 frames per second. And the game is just so gorgeous. It's running incredibly well. So scroll scroll down, Nick. Uh we're in the settings menu right now for Doom: The Dark Ages. And check it out. We're running at freaking Ultra Nightmare with uh the highest texture pool size.

And it's like, well, Mike, you're trying to play basketball with different sized basketballs every time because your DPI is always different. Things are never the same. Wait, but I got Nick to do the 360 test and look at that. And now he felt so comfortable. Here's why it keeps happening though. I think it's wrong.

Delete all the other DPI settings in your m in your, you know, settings cuz I know what happens. Uh Kevin, this little DPI button on the mouse. I know that's getting clicked accidentally and suddenly it's set to 40,000 and your mouse is moving crazy fast and you think that that's the only option you have. No. Delete them all. 800 DPI.

I used 1200 with my mouse, then turned down the in-game sensitivity. And Sean, that's great. because you kind of know what you're doing. For me, it's just like I'm just trying to give them a baseline. 800 DPI and then make sure your character does a 360. You don't think from one there, huh? You don't think Sean's a little crazy?

Thank you Nvidia for sponsoring this stream, allowing us to show off the power of DLSS on our incredible RTX 5090. Once again, we're playing with frame generation on. DLSS is also giving us uh the ability to play the game at 1440p cuz it's using AI to recreate the image to get it looking just as sharp and just as awesome as the native 1440p. We're getting 200 frames per second. We're getting uh again, we're playing on ultra nightmare visual mode, which is just buck wild. That's pretty nuts. The game looks awesome. It runs fantastic. It's kind of a match made in heaven. Nvidia and IDTech is just fantastic. So, thank you everybody for supporting the stream, supporting us here. We hope you all have a lovely weekend. Thank you once again, Nvidia for sponsoring this. Take care of yourself. Take care of each other. And we will see you back on Monday. Goodbye, gamers. [Music]",
