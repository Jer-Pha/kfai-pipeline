We are ranking, reviewing, and recapping every single Marvel movie, which means this is our 64th movie being ranked in all of the Marvel universe. 64 five until it's nice. Hey, I can't wait. I wonder what that's going to be. You know, it might end up being Secret Wars with the way things are going, but who knows? Of course, I'm Tim Gettys. I'm joined by Andy Cortez. Hello. A returning Greg Miller. Hi, everybody. It's me, Greg. He's been gone all day. We got two days away from everything happening here. I can't do that. Can't do that. I'm going to need a Coke.

He was like, \"Oh, Andy must have been here.\" But then I realized Andy and I agreed to split popcorn and I was in fact holding that popcorn. Who could have done it, I wonder?

I'm just like yeah I think that the majority of these MCU movies are things that I really really like and this is one that I really really like. So yeah, 24 for me. Andy Cortez has it at 24 as well under Ant-Man one. There we go. I just, you know, I I I just couldn't put it above old Paul Rudd doing his thing, you know, his damn thing. Uh, Nikki, baby. Mhm. Has it at number 18? 18. I put it high. 18 underneath the Avengers one makes sense as well. And then Greg Miller has it higher than any of us at number 14 on it. Thought about it for a second the whole time as me and Nick are [\u00a0__\u00a0] you know chucklefest over here. I didn't hear a whole lot of laughs from Greg and I was like I wonder if he's like not enjoying this. When that little girl got killed I I walked out before I went to the restaurant. I was like, \"Am I wrong in thinking it was weird that how loud Greg",

I was like, \"Am I wrong in thinking it was weird that how loud Greg laughed there?\" And Roger was like, \"Which part?\" I was like, I was like, \"No, Joey, when the girl gets like zapped, everybody.\" And Joy's like, \"Oh, I gasp.\" And Ro, oh, I guess, too. And I was like, \"No, but then you laughed at Greg after he started laughing.\" He's like, \"Oh, yeah, that was really weird.\" Yeah. Greg got it at number 14 underneath Guardians of the Galaxy 1. So, yeah, very solid stuff. Highly recommend going to watch this. I think that it is um pretty important to the MCU. I don't think pivotal, but I do think that it uh we all kind of expected for Fantastic 4 to be like the All right, y'all. Here's the jump on point to Secret Wars, and I actually think it's this one. Agreed. So, yeah, it's such a neat, which is why I'm interested in where it ranked in the final final MCU.",

I think it's the easiest recommendation. Go watch this theaters. Yes, totally agree. Thunderbolts is at number 18. Okay. Number 18 underneath Guardians. Can you go super wide so people can see numbers 1 through 12 and underneath Deadpool one. Okay. Or over Deadpool one but under Guardians 3. Yeah, I'm happy with it. It's exactly where I put it. You're right. You're right. What a list of movies. What a list of movies. We are so back so great. Fantastic 4. I'm calling R. Can I see the whole list again, please? Fantastic. Sounds so good. Oh, interesting. He's looking at the list. I think Fantastic 4 is going to crack top 10. I say it steals Guardian 2 spot. I love that. I want to believe I want",

And again, hearing that IMAX uh little promo thing that they had, I was like, \"Oh, this movie is going to slap.\" Uh, so there we go. That is the MCU in review so far. Next week, we're returning to Alien in review with Alien Covenant. Uh, exciting times for everybody involved. Until next time, have a marvelous day. [Music]",
