For now, let's start with the topic of the show. It's an Outerworld re-review. It's We're getting close, Greg. Well, we think we're getting close. I guess you know it's still listed as 2025. Still no date on the Outer Worlds 2. So the way it goes Andy is that we saw Jeff Keley Summer Game Fest on the horizon. Then Xbox horns in and says, \"You know what? Sunday we're going to do the Xbox presentation at SGF. Then we're going to do the Outer Worlds 2 presentation afterwards.\" And that got me percolating of like, you know what?

And obviously, we could play it in the run-up to the actual release of the game, but that's not going to help us when we're watching on Sunday going, \"What's that? What's this? I don't remember that. What's Spacer's Choice? That doesn't make any sense to me.\" And so, I started percolating on that. And then, of course, my DICE co-host, Stella Chung, hit me up and said, \"Hey, are you do you have a person for The Outer Worlds, too?\" And I'm like, \"Hey, a lot of us are that person, but you can come be that person with us.\" So, I said, \"We're going to do re-review.\" Stella said she'd get get in there for the re-review, too. and we're jumping in today to talk about it.

I loved it. I got a bunch of hours into it. I didn't finish the DLC, the like murder mystery one, but okay. Um, I I might go back and replay it now because replaying it I was like, \"Oh my god, yeah, that's right. [\u00a0__\u00a0] love this game.\" Yeah. So, uh, Greg bringing this up was kind of perfect for me because leading up to Avowed coming out, I think we were already reviewing Avowed. We just couldn't say anything.

And I think about combat is or about as a video game. I think it's like far and away a much better video game in terms of mechanics and movement. But you're talking about a game from October 2019 versus game of 2025. Right. Right. Especially when we're talking about just game developers having a more modern sense of how games should feel and and move. And it's I think also back in the day when I first played Outer Worlds, I wasn't keyboard mousing yet. Yeah. this time around playing it again, it's like, oh, I I still any keyboard mouse shooter, it always has the benefit of like that's a plus point in the positive column of like I get to click and shoot things and it feels good.

Every day I get home, all my eyes go on and go to sleep. Um, but uh yeah, I would play Outer Worlds at night and then hop into whatever I was uh reviewing afterwards. But it's going to be interesting to look back on this, Greg, cuz I listen to per your request. It was a very good request by Greg Miller, who said, \"Andy, go ahead and listen to our first review of The Outer Worlds from when me, Van Mirabella, and Imran Khan were on the Kind of funny games cast.\" There it is.

Funny thing about this episode of the Games Cast because obviously there we've done this a gajillion, right? This is episode 200 and whatever. Uh, my dog Nick, where you at? Look at this episode.

I think he played more. Right. Yeah. Exactly. It's hilarious to me of like, you know, I was like started this episode and it turned out to be like one of the most infamous ones as you see over Tim's right shoulder or the left side of Tim's screen. You see everything falling off in the background there and that's the one that was in like the when we got the new studio video. We made fun of that or whatever.

Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah. So, obviously a nice little time travel. We'll talk about that review here in a second. But, uh, you know, you also helped me out, Greg, by having some other people's reviews from back when Outer Worlds first launched. And we'll kind of read them right now.

As you uh explore a space colony, the character you decide to become will determine how the playerdriven story unfolds. In the colony's corporate equation, you are the unplanned variable. Also had two DLCs called Peril on Gorgon and Murder on Eridanos. Every time you read Gorgon, did you think of the Gorgonites? Of course I did. Of course. Come on, Link. Let's go. Rolling around. Small soldiers, everybody. Gorgonites. I think I think Stella's maybe too. Oh, you're thinking Zelda. No. Yeah, the Gorgon, right? Gorgonites, man. Come on, dude. Soldiers.

The team of Obsidian excels at encouraging creative experimentation within its responsive and absurd setting, ensuring ensuring that every visit to Houseion is a is full of delightful surprises. Surpris and delight surprising. IGN's Dan Stapleton with an 8.5 says, \"With the Outer Worlds, Obsidian has found its own path in the space between the space between Wicked.\" You're always there for God.

Uh and considering that new RPGs from either one of those influential developers are still away, the game couldn't have come at a better time. It's not explorable as one big open world, but it still packs in a larger portion of flexible quests and conflicts within its series of smaller ones and conflicts within its series of smaller ones. And the combat, character, and companion systems have enough new spins on existing ideas to make it feel like an homage with its own personality rather than a copy.

But nevertheless, The Outer Worlds absolutely delivers on its premise as an immersive full-bodied RPG that successfully picks up the baton where Bethesda has been dropping it of late.

I was just, you know, just moving around. No problem. And it was funny today to load up my PlayStation 4 save through the PlayStation 5. Like this. I put down the portal. I did some work.

Cat Bailey calls it out in the part that I'm not on of the review of like, well, they were saying that we are smaller. This is a spiritual successor in New Vegas. It isn't New Vegas, but still the way it was marketed and shown, I do think it led you to believe it was going to be as fully fledged as a Fallout with a million different things happening.

She's going to be able to charm people. And then, yeah, for the stats, put it all into melee. And then really went into the stealth perks because I love hacking. I love lockpicking. I love doing all this. And so, I feel that my expectations being lower for this version of it had me enjoy it more. Right. Cuz again, I was like, I don't remember what I didn't like about it.

Like, as a one-handed melee person, right, I'd done guns in my last playthrough. If you want to throw up uh the OG stats, uh Barrett, uh you go in here and you see like I spread it out a bit more. I was still very stealth uh with Jenna Evil. Uh but I didn't do melee. I was putting into handguns and stuff, but I wanted to do something different here. So, I'm just using melee and I'm running in and I am just bashing people over the head over and over again. I'm slowing down time. I'm I'm, you know, holding it for a hard shot, hitting them, taking them out.

It seems like everything I complained about in the the initial review and am going to complain about here they've said for Outer Worlds 2, Outer Worlds 2, we are addressing, which is great because at its core, The Outer Worlds is a great RPG. I think that's the big takeaway from it. I think uh going through this time and being like, you know what, I remember being pretty evenly spread on my stats. This time around, I'm going to commit to things. And I committed to that one-handed melee. And I committed to, you know, my dialogue skills of being able to persuade, lie, intimidate a bit.

Like I jumped back into my PlayStation 4 save today and went to go uh unlock the door to turn on the turret to shoot the enemy and I was like, \"Oh, I didn't get my lockpick up in this version.\" Like for Xbox, I was able to turn on the turret to shoot the guy. So I went in there and just bashed him like three or four times and he was dead and then moved on and did my thing. And I was also like, \"Oh, that's interesting.\" On my initial playthrough, uh, in spoilers for the Outerorlds, I feel like you should be I'm just going to name names.

So, it's interesting that there's those permutations to get you there. And again, one of the things I think is interesting about the marketing that you'll hear at a much larger scale at SGF, but the IGN coverage has been, hey, like on top of making the gunplay tighter and doing this, they want choice to matter even more in this game and have it influence the entire experience rather than just specific quest lines, which is something I would cheer for because so much the reason Outer Worlds is beloved and should be beloved is the writing and it is the situational comedy they're giving you.

When we talk about the story, I think a lot of it is I think maybe the story could be more uh more compelling if you weren't constantly breaking up your experience with other side quests.
