Welcome back to another episode of the Kind of Funny Screencast, your home for all of the TV and streaming show convos you could want and or need here at Kind of Funny. The Star Wars crew is back today to talk about Andor season 2, episode 7 through 9. And to do just that, we are finally joined by our rebel spy who has returned from his recent mission at Star Wars Celebration in Japan. It is one Anthony Carboni. Hello. It is wonderful to be back. It is wonderful to be back with these penultimate episodes of the show where ba baby I don't know. I'm starting to think that Andor is a good Star War. Yeah. You think so? I don't know if I don't know if y'all I don't know what y'all think, but I'm st I don't want to you know it might be a little too early to say that honestly. Only three episodes left. I don't know.

Oh man, it was absolutely wonderful. uh maybe one of the best events we've ever had at Star Wars Celebration in in my 10 years of doing it. And uh it was lovely to be in Japan for a little bit of time afterwards. It was lovely to uh to walk amongst the forests on the philosophers's path and really just really just think about Gorman, you know, look at the beautiful temples and be in the woods and in the forest and surrounded by all this nature and be like, \"What about Gorman?\" Yeah. What's going to happen on Gorman? Yeah. Um, no, it was it was wonderful. It was wonderful. I missed uh I missed being here with y'all and I'm excited to catch up. We miss you as well. Um,",

And don't fret, even though Tim Gettys went on a sbatical after his embarrassing loss and kind of funny game showdown to recover from that.

Give me less than a minute what your feelings have been on the season so far and then tell me about your thoughts on the episodes that have come out this week. First of all, I want to give a shout out to the true heroes of the rebellion, the top two, the greatest to ever do it. Number one is uh is obviously Clay Marquy. Clay Marky, who I think is the real the real power behind the Axis spy network. She just crushes in these three episodes just as everybody is falling apart watching her just get more and more focused.

Gorman Bell, let I want to say one of the things that's been really lovely to me about about this show. This is my thesis statement for these three, and we'll get into we'll get into the real stuff, but what I love is having Gorman based on the French resistance in World War II has really allowed them to do a lot of very interesting things. and the malicious compliance that we see from everybody at all levels. You know, I can't I'm not going to be somebody who shoots a sniper rifle out a window, but I can be the guy who doesn't leave a paper trail for the sniper. I'm not the person who can",

Really cool to see. Uh and also just my final statement is uh I'm glad Sirill K figured out what a douchebag he was before he died. I wanted him to die knowing what a douchebag he was. Rest in peace. There was a moment of growth for for Cirill. Who are you, dude? Who are you? Who the [\u00a0__\u00a0] are you? Uh, we'll get into I don't even know you, bro. Uh, Sage, what about yourself?

How did you feel about uh these three episodes? Oh my god. I mean, it's something that like uh Anthony, you haven't been here, but that's the exact same thing that I've been saying is like it's all of these like small pieces of the Rebellion. Like, we've seen what Jedi can do for the Rebellion. We've seen what the best pilots in the galaxy can do for the Rebellion, but this is all about what everyday people do in both directions. It's about the actual compliance of everyday people that allow the empire to take hold. And it's about the people who are not heroes that did their part. The people who were nobody special that didn't have access to anything special uh that were integral pieces of why the empire collapses.

Imperial is a complex, featurerich action RPG where you'll be sent to a planet in a far-off corner of the galaxy to explore an imposing monolith. As an elite mercenary, you'll join the expedition tasked with unearthing the secrets of the monolith and face off against the deadly automatons within. In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith. Accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams. Each cardoggram affects which enemies, boss fights, and loot will appear when you enter the monolith, so no two excursions will be the same.

She knows that this is what it's been working up to, but it's completely counter to everything she's been doing to help and to protect herself and her family and the rebellion for the last, you know, 5 years.

I will still continue to protect her. When Luan says like he has protected you in ways you will never know. Um it's heartbreaking. Yeah. You you hear in the wedding episode when he speaks to Luan.

I love that everyone in Yavin was like, \"Hey, put on goggles and blasters and back up and we've got this thing restrained, but still like maybe maybe have more guns. Maybe have all the guns.\" Yeah.
