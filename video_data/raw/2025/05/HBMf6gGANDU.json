There's stuff that we have to decide what what people get to fill in in the empty space in their minds and what we get to show. And we only have a certain amount of time to do it. It's very rare that a show structured like this uh dicks the landing so well. This show stuck the landing. Absolutely. Absolutely. I was so happy. Sage, uh, I couldn't agree more. I think it was, uh, I think that this was obviously very hyped in my head, which would have been very difficult to live up to, and it did.

Um, I think that, you know, every week on this we were making these predictions and guessing what could happen next, but so much can change in a year that they can make so many unexpected choices. And, uh, I think they really, really killed it by every character being important. And I think that felt so satisfying in the end in that Cassian story isn't done. We have a whole movie after this that is the wrap-up of Cassian's story. and they were really really particular to make sure that everyone else was wrapped up that we don't get another movie about that we don't have a continuation of.

I do want to give a shout out to our force healing soothsayer Barrett Courtourtney who said this show will end with the first shot of Andor in Rogue One.

I was like let's go. Darren, what did you think of uh of the finale?

And uh I can talk a little bit more about that later, but I I think this is this is one of the all-time greats. Um, you know, I was saying last week a lot of this season felt like it was building up to uh the Gorman massacre from last week and I was kind of left to question of like what else do we have left to do for this last week?

And getting the one of the first big beats uh at the first episode uh of this week of drops of Dedra coming to Luan's uh shop and it it it brought me back. Stick with me here. It brought me back to season five of Breaking Bad where so much a good chunk of Breaking Bad is Gus Fring. And then once the Gus Fring arc saga kind of ends, you're like, well, what else is there left to tell?

Uh I think uh Alyssa Merante or maybe someone else I remember uh seeing post this on Blue Sky a few weeks ago of like Andor is almost too good for Star Wars uh in some ways and it it there may whether you agree with that or not but like the weight of that and like I I think where that is coming from uh I I definitely understand and there",

Uh the I can't talk enough about the set design, the costume design, all of that throughout this series. The amount of it, everything had to mean more. It's every shot. It's every time we go back to a character. Sawrera, man, we've seen him across a lot of different shows and games and properties and it kind of can feel like ah is this working? Whatever. It works now. Like yes, like episodes from two weeks ago or whatever. Like it all makes it all it all works.

Uh it's deception. Save the rebellion, save the trees. Uh such classic moments here. Um but no, this show just like I I we we for years now uh talked about Clone Wars and and Rebels and all of that stuff and then so many amazing moments and and all of that. I still haven't seen all of Clone Wars. I now have seen all of Rebels and it does make sense of the things that didn't make sense before.

But with Andor, they did something so different, which is caring so much about how it fits into the lore and not stepping on uh what matters in the history and like to the true fans. Like I'm sure there's some things they changed this and that, whatever, but overall they really tried to be lore accurate. Yeah. On top of that, they made an incredibly perfect show. Like I I give this a 10 out of 10. And it's like normally we're like nothing's perfect. I think Andor might be perfect. Yeah, it I I'm right there with you.

It's it's now it's now a thing. I I personally think that this series is is great and it and it might be limited by the fact that it's for Star Wars fans. Do you know what I mean?

He was the most cautious and the most worried about what was going to go down. And it was such a great reminder because they needed to remind us in the beginning of this to to get the drama that we needed. We needed to be reminded that Luan is not a great guy. Yes.

I it it's not necessarily, but if I had to peg it to something that I already knew, the first thing that popped into my head was Mim Bam. The the the reason why I was thinking Clone Wars or something like a bit more early on is because I I I forget like how long it's been like uh Solo is like uh what 10 BBY or something like that.

Uh yeah, I I didn't mind it, especially because, you know, the big thing was a lack of Lutheran and Clea from last week. So, to me, it felt like kind of a bit of a a nice balance to get more of a focus on them because they're so integral to all of this. And then uh the other thing is like I I've been thinking about this a lot in terms of like it feels like Andor's character arc ended in season one like that that was his arc and then season two is a bit more about how he wants to choose to fight against the Empire and it's a lot of this back",

Uh, and I do think, you know, when people when we're talking about the sister and we're talking about the sister as a loose end, um, you know, it's it's interesting. Tony Gilroy has been asked about this and he said the idea was there was somebody Cassian couldn't save and that motivated him. That was one of those motivators in the background that made him no, but if I can save somebody, I should cuz I couldn't save my sister, right? And that that that's an initial motivation to him, a semi-selfish motivation to get him into the rebellion. So then, can I say this, and I say this as Andor is like my favorite show of all time. So I want to preface with that. I still think it's a perfect show. But is that two women's that two women that were brought up and their stories that were only created to be motivators for Cassian, right? Because we have the sister and",

We never are going to revisit that. Then we have Bix doing the same thing. We I'll I'll take one, but two's too many. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm happy we get back to the sister.

It's it it brings back the like Luan died for this information. Like all of these threads that lead to this moment of Andor getting engulfed. Like that moment works for me now.

Not just him holding it, but just that dude who is already dead shot. That's one of my notes. That's one of my notes is supervisor cre whatever he is. The guy who takes over uh Dedra's desk not just being used. It's the same thing as the seral death. They made the death of these horrible people so cathartic. Yeah. When you see K2 just like moving this wiggly little dead rat around getting shot, you're like, you deserve that. That's what you get. You worked for that.

She was in the world between worlds. actually 2 years of character growth and now it makes sense because I Jyn Erso is the worst at the beginning of Rogue One. The first thing I want is her at the beginning crawls out of the Starlac pit. Hear me out. She also had a secret apprentice the whole time. Um I am so happy that Dedra wasn't the the the meat shield.

We've watched the entire thing happen and what that did to so many people's lives. That's some good stuff. And she's probably going to have to build the Death Star, too. Which you have to be making those little sprockets. She's going to be pushing the sprocket lever.

He he is fully recognizing that the uh need for imperial control Imperial need for control is desperate because it is so unnatural and he is recognizing that in a moment where he is about to feel the full force of Imperial control and the and the reason he kills himself it be is because he knows what it's like to be on the other side.
