For the last almost 10 years, we've had a kind of funny best friend in the chats in the comments of our videos with the Subway Surfers name and it's like, how is this possible? How is it possible? The biggest mobile game of all time. How are why are they here right now? Uh it is because our homie Christian is a best friend and uh he is also in charge of a lot of the marketing over at Subway Surfers. And so we're finally officially partnering and working together for this celebrating uh the 13th birthday of Subway Surfers, which is absolutely wild. Very long time coming for this here, the 200th world tour that we've went on. Of course, I am Tim Gettys. I'm joined today by Greg Miller. I started my subway surfing career today. Nick Scarpino.

I remember uh I don't know if we can speak about competitors, but I remember a Temple Run back in the day. That was a big deal. And then Subway Surfers immediately took over as the bigger one, as the better one. Uh, and I stand by it. It is the goated endless runner runner. Uh, it is the game that I played so much of uh, back in the day in middle school, high school, college, and now adulthood. I stand by it as an adult doing it professionally.

If you have Subway servers, please do that. Of course, it helps support us. It helps prove to subway servers this was all worth doing.

Everybody's in LA. Everyone's in LA. Um, and it was a five or six episode run of every night back to back to back. Um, they would have a John Malanyled live show that was actually live on Netflix, like really live.

It just it's so satisfying and it results in not every episode being the funniest thing ever.
