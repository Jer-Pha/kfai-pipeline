I liked it. Here's my thing. I saw uh Wario uh 64 tweet this. Yeah, Kevin, there's a link there if you want to throw it out. I thought it was bizarre because it was a link to the Nintendo Japan website with the same screenshots that we've already been seeing for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's updates for Switch 2, which by the way, a funny thing about these is these screenshots aren't even in 4K. They're like, there's nowhere on the internet that I have found at least that these screenshots are actually showing what the advancements are. So, it's like, okay, cool. So, I was like, oh, we're actually going to get some more detailed information.

So, be sure to update and experience the world of Pokemon on the Nintendo Switch 2 before anyone else. Now, there's one word here that sends me and it is comfortably like the fact that they are admitting to the experience of playing.

Neither Sega nor Atlas has adowed a remake of Persona 4, but reports have persisted for some time that I'm so sorry that what is currently in development.
