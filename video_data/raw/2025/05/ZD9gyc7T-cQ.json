Joel's decision to save Ellie, or rather to murder a load of doctors who were planning to use Ellie's immunity to create a cure that could have saved humanity, has always been shrouded in a level of ambiguity. Within the original game as well as The Last of Us's HBO TV adaptation, it was never explicitly confirmed whether a cure could actually have been possible, and if so, whether it actually would have worked. Because of this, Joel's actions can be seen through the lens of him saving someone he knows will die as part of the procedure, someone he knows, I'm sorry, someone he now thinks of as his daughter after his actual daughter died for just the chance of a cure.

Uh, quote, \"Could the Fireflies make a cure?\" Duckman said, speaking as part of the Sacred Symbols podcast. Our intent was yes, they could. Now, is our science a little shaky that now that now people are now questioning it? Sure, our science is a little shaky and people are now questioning it. I can't I can't say anything. I can say our intent was that they would have made a cure. That makes the most interesting philosophical question for what Joel does. End quote.

That's so interesting because I think that if I were in Joel's position, I probably would have done what he did.

This is a great example of it. Right. As you read the book, right? I mean, here you go. The kids in room 2B could tell something was very wrong. Even though it was their very first day of school, they had a sense something was missing. Where's the teacher? Someone whispered. As you can see, Mr. S has been written on the the chalkboard.

Its clever enga it's its clever engaging move sets and solid TMNT story made up for its slim enemy variety and disappointing lack of bells and whistles. Even though that new coat of paint doesn't always suit the sewer dwelling teens, it still stands as a fun quick tactics game reminiscent of arcade classics that continue to define TMNT. Uh Steve Watts over at GameSpot agreed gave it a seven as well. Imagine sitting on the floor in front of your TV watching the pilot episode for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the 1990s.
