I think it's not really my play style, but I do enjoy watching other people play. So, when you guys were doing that, I was watching. Um, it's one of those things like I can enjoy it through the enjoyment of others more than for myself. Okay. Uh, but I do have an important question. How bad did that room smell after the weekend? You know what? Still, I have a big rule in the stream room and you've seen it before. I make everybody clean all the time and uh, you know, I didn't sweat too much.

Wait, what did I miss? It was so much Stella. I blocked him cuz I was jealous. He was taking Blessing out to lunch and not me. So I blocked him. Then we became best friends. To be fair, that's because you don't respond to texts actually wanting to meet up. So I think that's kind of him. Even Stella knows that. Dude, Stella knows. Stella knows. Bro, do you know the amount of times every time I meet up with Mike, he's like, \"Oh man, how you been? We should hang out.

Story number two, Stella. GTA 6 delay could mean 700,000 fewer Xbox and PlayStation console sales this year. Coming from Christopher Dring at Game Business, a leading industry data firm has reduced its 2025 sales estimates for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X by 700,000 units following the delay of Grand Theft Auto 6. Ampier analysis has also lowered its forecast for PlayStation and Xbox game sales down by 21 million units. Overall, AIR believes the console market will miss out on $2.7 billion in revenue this year due to GTA 6 delay. Of course, much of this will simply move to 2026",

But I feel like at this point, we're reaching a point in hardware where it's kind of harder to find the next step that's not going to be absurdly expensive.

What I am excited for, Stella, you and I are playing some Grand Theft Auto 6, and I cannot wait for next May. I'm very excited. Uh, it was t it was it was hard to hear the delay because I wanted it so badly, but May, we got 12 months from now. We'll be back right to it. It'll be very, very exciting stuff. Do you think we see anything around Summer Game Fest or that past trailer is all we get for the summer season with Grand Theft Auto? Honestly, I'm totally fine if they don't. Um, I feel like that trailer at the announcement of the delay was probably great for them to have. I would say maybe something more towards like Game",

But also, if they don't release anything else, I'm so okay with that because at this point, I think a lot of people just want to see the game when it's ready, right? So, getting that trailer a year away, people were like, \"Oh, it looks great.\" But also, damn, we could have had that this year. It makes people feel a little bit more upset about the fact that it's not coming out soon. So, um I feel like if it come if there's more reveal stuff that comes out in December or even January, I feel like that's a little bit better than if they decided to do that in the summer. Yeah.

Death Stranding 2's scores are Death Stranding 2's scoring well with test reviewers, but Kajjima isn't satisfied. This coming from Darren Bonth at GameSpot. Death Stranding was a polariz polarizing game when it first released, but for the upcoming sequel, previews and early reviews for the game have largely been positive. in a recent interview with game director Hideoko Khajima explained how he was happy to see test audiences react more favorably to Deathstrating 2 on the beach but he also explained how this had left him feeling",

I'm not interested in appealing to a mass market or selling millions of copies. That's not what I'm aiming for.\" End quote. Kajjima did acknowledge the paradox of this approach as while he may not be aiming to appeal to a broader gaming market, Death Stranding 2 still needs to sell a sizable number of units if he wants to keep the lights on at Kajjima Productions and pay his developers uh and pay his staff.

We are a month away from playing Death Stranding 2 and seeing what Kjima and his team have created for this follow-up sequel. You know, if Kajjima just leaned in full Tarantino and just did more feet, I think he would get that lower score that he wants. You know what I mean? Like, I'm just saying. It depends on who's reviewing it, Cello. Like, more feet could get him higher. Yeah, you're right. If Blessing's reviewing it, he'll definitely give it a higher score. Well, he'll give it a 10 toes out of 10 toes. You know what I mean? Now, Blessing didn't like the hand little piggies. The hand hand creatures freak him out. Yeah. The hand creatures freaked out.

I never gave it a bunch of time. Uh, I probably played a couple hours of then put it down.

Okay, Stella, they're bringing everybody back. Let's talk about that. Of course, work from home era. Uh people have found success with this hybrid workspace. people have found success being able to hire incredible talent all around the globe. I thought we celebrated that in the games industry these past couple of years of the idea of you can get talent now from everywhere and not ask them to move from across the globe or not be able to get those talented people because they won't be able to move.

They just want to save money and they just want to have an excuse to let people go. I The fact that they said they were slowly phasing out remote jobs is kind of crazy to me that they were just so open about it, but I guess it is EA, so who knows?
