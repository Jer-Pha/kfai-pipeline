Obviously, since that was a shadow drop, we didn't have a chance to review it. We didn't get early codes. Nobody knew about it. We got it when everybody else was able to get their hands on it.

The original expansion packs Knights of the Nine and Shivering Isles are part of Oblivion Remastered. I definitely have the least amount of history with this franchise cuz I was always the boware RPG player. You looked at this, you're like, \"Get out of here, Bethesda.\" and I only had time, you know, time and money and I couldn't be going all over the place. But, uh, you know, Mike, you have a a pretty big history with Oblivion. Uh, what is your past with Oblivion at like the OG one from 2004?

Uh me and my brother actually had Marowind and uh didn't understand anything that was going on in that game cuz when you're so young and like that game little to no guidance on that one really just let you go off the rails on that one. That was pretty special back in the day. But Oblivion to me was the perfect time, right? I must have been that 12 to 14 age range there. And so it was like peak gaming. This was it. I bought my first strategy guide for Oblivion and I was reading up on all the DRI princes. I was shutting down all of the Oblivion gates. It was everything to me.

You know, we're so pampered now with this remaster. If you go back to the old school Oblivion, which is on backwards compatibility, which I did on one of my streams, the compass is this small, Andy, you can barely tell which way to go and like you have no idea. So on Marowind, there was no real like, hey, this is a clear defined where you need to go. So we'd get lost all the time trying to figure out what are the quest objectives, where should we be going.

So the idea of like this true RPG of skill points, stats, what is your character, all these different races. So yeah, it was cool enough to want to play more. Oblivion gets announced or comes out, do you get hyped for it immediately because of Morowind or like what drew you into it being this Xbox game? Oh, early 360 Xbox games. Anything that was big on the 360 back then? Peter Jackson's King Kong. Never forget. You know what I mean? Cameo. Oh, yeah. Okay. Don't forget. You know what I mean? Uh, so yeah, it was just one of the early Xbox 360 launch window titles, right, that I can vividly remember being excited about and thinking, \"Oh, wow.

Do I have to play one through three? I was definitely that dude. And this is King Kong by the way. Oh hell yeah. Never forget.

Now, how much of that was you hitting the button to level up your lock? Can we talk about that? That was so good. That was all of what 15 minutes yesterday while I did work. Explain what happened from your perspective. There's just this sound coming from Greg's desk, right? It's just a a tapping sound.

But then over on one side, he's playing Oblivion and he's at the lockpick screen and he's just halfass lockpicking this thing. And I'm going, \"What is he doing in my mind there? What's this tapping going on?\" And it's a thing where Mike walked by me and I had noticed this already and I I kind of looked at him and Mike walked by me and me and Mike looked at each other and we both looked we gave each other look like, \"What's Greg doing?\" And we look at Greg, what are you doing? I was upgrading my lockpicking, but the tapping was going for a while.

Like, literally your stats will be built out so much differently and you'll have these really robust characters. I love when games have those systems. Me, too. Cool. And but it's like the way",

And but it's like the way they do it is interesting. We'll talk about it because it's so classic Bethesda. But like the idea here is that the more you do it, the more you get it. And so when you level up one of you you do these things to level up your lockpicking or your blade or whatever and then that gives you when you level that up a level up for your overall character to go in and change your stats which again is going to change blah blah blah. So lockpicking in this game is bad. I don't like lockpicking in this game. Yeah. And it's like CL and it's and this is, you know, if I especially from an the sidelines now participating like this is one of those things that like clearly Bethesda was like what are we doing with this remaster and they're like we're remastering the game.

We're gonna go we're just gonna this is what people are gonna expect out of Oblivion. We're not remaking it. Right. And so as Barrett has pulled up here what the lockpicking miniame is, you know, you take your little lockpicker, you push the clip up and they fall down and then but when they hang for a second, that's when you got to lock them in. The worst. But it's like you burn through lockpicks so [\u00a0__\u00a0] fast. And it's like it was my it was the first boss of the game that I encountered.

My final one.\" Like, and I think the thing I bothers me the most about it, Greg, is these little pins vary in speed. So, tell me about that. So, again, this goes back to, you see up there, it talks about your security level is 16 on this one, right? And then over there it said average for the lock or whatever. When you increase your security level, the locks become easier. They stick more. You do the whole thing, right? Is it a timing thing? Does your window get larger? like you push them up there and they hang way longer. You lock it in. So anyways, I you know I what I to start this my thoughts of playing Oblivion for the first time.

You know, cuz I at one point I thought when the thing was coming out, I was like, \"Oh, is this another tell for when I should do it?\" Like one of my lock pickups. It wasn't. But I went to look at another one and I ran into a Reddit thread and it was just like, \"By the way, they haven't patched this other thing where if you lock in one pin, if you then tap A on it over and over again, it just counts as success, success.\" So that's what I was doing is I I sat there for 10 minutes doing email tapping a and that just took me to 99 on my every lock every lock is easy easy for me to get into.",

That's that old school stuff that Greg was talking about where you can sneak behind somebody and your stealth continues to increase. So you'll see people constantly walking behind people there to level up. Yeah, I saw it in the chat. Yeah, we have a super chat from Demon Hacker. Did Greg rubber band his sticks to level up sneaking? Right. I haven't done that yet, but I will. And it's the thing of like for me that is the story of Skyrim cuz I I Skyrim has very similar systems, right? Obviously a sequel to this uh a bit more modern because it was a bit later in the you know the timeline but I remember Skyrim being my first Elder Scrolls and it was that idea.

So, like again, like I feel like both of these stories are such great windows into what Oblivion is and what kind of game it is and what kind of RPG it is.

And it's like, cool, I've leveled up. Well, I can't apply any of these stats until I go sleep. That [\u00a0__\u00a0] sucks. Like, what is, you know, we're so everything we play nowadays has been streamlined and to be frictionless, which is always such a great word. And so, it's funny to come back to this game and have all these different things of friction. And it's a thing of like, cool, I have a healing spell for minor wounds.

I was telling Jen about this last night at a very romantic anniversary, very romantic anniversary date where I just talked about Oblivion. I had to talk about Oblivion. Where again, it's it's I'm doing things to warm him up, you know? I'm doing things in this game that I haven't done in forever. And one of those is cheesing where it's just like, \"Cool, go clear out this nest of vampires. Got that. Get there. Get my ass handed to me by the vampire. Just get my ass handed to it.\" And it's that idea of like, \"Okay, well, I'm going to eat [\u00a0__\u00a0] and kill every one of these vampire.\" Like, I'm challenging myself to do it when clearly the game doesn't want me to do it cuz I'm underleveled",

So, it's like I start all I go in there and I'll tease one of them out and they come out and we're fighting on a hillside. So, you know, they kill me and I load the save and I they kill me and I load the save and then it's like, okay, well, I run them down the hill and then I run back up the hill, but you can't run up a hill. So, I'm doing the trudgy walk. So, then I turn around and I'm shooting arrows at this poor vampire who's slowly trudging up behind me.

In Imperial, you'll explore four vastly different quadrants of the monolith, accessible only by using mysterious artifacts known as cardoggrams. Each cardoggram affects which enemies, boss fights, and loot will appear when you enter the monolith. So, no two excursions will be the same. Find even more cardoggrams to explore by looting defeated enemies or buy them from other players online at the trading post. You'll need to make sure you have the right gear to take on the harder Cardiggrams. Build your mercenary, choose your gear, master your abilities, and take down everything in your path in Imperial. Face off against enormous",

I think Grand Theft Autos and old school Bethesda games are always like my just go-to. These are my favorite games from my childhood. And I'm so happy that it got the remaster, right? Like we talked about it. We haven't really talked how beautiful this game. This game is unbelievable when you turn it on and like for me, right, I go back to my old save on my old on the original file of the game. It's like you look at that and then you look at it's like, man, how blessed am I to have one of my favorites",

Especially damn because I always saw these games even at the time as ugly. Like I was never a fan of the art direction or art style and um and a lot of that just kind of like compounded when even you know Fallout New Vegas and then Skyrim and I was like god they just I don't want to exist in any of this. Yeah. And so to have Virtuos, I think do kind a a pretty killer job making remaking all these assets from the ground up, making uh using Unreal Engine 5's just like super goated lighting system. It It runs It also runs really great when it doesn't crash. I was impressed by that. I'm surprised you guys haven't.

Um, but I was very impressed with how amazing the game was looking running at 4K, super high, you know, really good frame rate and it looking as amazing as it did and it was only using like 50% of my GPU. So, I was pretty impressed by how lightweight it was. Um, because the game is massive. I mean, it's 100 plus gigs, right, Mike? Like, it's it's 11 to download. Yeah, I believe it's very big. You want those high 4K res textures, you know, it's going to be a big ass download. It's just one of those, it's so beautiful and it's just fun to walk from point to point, explore the map.

And I I like, man, I wish that we could have gotten not even just a trilogy remake, that's like pie in the sky. I wish we could have gotten like a Mass Effect one remake in this style with full art assets and everything and have virtuoso pop off. And you know, it does bum me out and I I hope that maybe we can revisit those RPGs sometime soon with a better coat of paint. Uh we do have a couple of last second Hail Mary. My apparel is always broken. Huh? My apparel is always broken. Really? When I get into fights with people immediately breaking it. Another mod you can download legitimately.

I love having uh someone come and follow you as like a short-term companion and then growing attached to them and then they die in front of you and that feeling of like damn I didn't want you to die. Wanted to make it all the way with you. Last second uh super chat from Vulk Dasher with a $10 super chat. Thank you.

Nothing cooler than seeing the first Oblivion gate in this remaster and how gorgeous that is with the color and the darkness in the background in front of that castle. It's like, oh my god, this is crazy. I really enjoyed it on the stream when I ran into the first Oblivion gate.
