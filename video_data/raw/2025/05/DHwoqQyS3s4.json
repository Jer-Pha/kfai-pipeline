Welcome back to another fun-filled day of streaming here on twitch.tv/confunnames or over on the YouTubes if you're watching there. My name is Nick and I'm joined by Andy Cortez, the Nitro Rifle. You're about to experience a game of the year. That's what I've been told. Uh, now of course we had an incredible, incredible, incredible marathon stream last weekend. Shout out to Mike and Roger to all of you who watched and supported those shenanigans. Uh, but today we wanted to take it down a little, have a chill moment. And, uh, we were pitching around ideas for games that I have not experienced yet. And Tim brought up. He's like, \"Why don't you play Expedition 33?\" Uh, because I think you might actually like the story. Maybe not the combat, but the story. So, I'm happy to sit with you and uh, and play through this. Where are you at with this game? Beat it twice. Really? Yeah. Twice. twice and have continued to play it since then. Wow.",
