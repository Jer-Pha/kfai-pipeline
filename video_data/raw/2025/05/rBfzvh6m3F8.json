Normally games daily is at 10. Games cast is at 11 Pacific time, but we're switching that around. Why blessing out a Yo-Yo Junior? cuz I got to scadaddle. I'm going to LA on a flight. I'm hopping on a flight to go to LA to attend Riot. I'm going to Riot. Um I'm going to see their new card game. Okay. Riftbound. Card Game Poppy. Blessing out of your age. That's what they're calling me nowadays. Uh Riftbound is essentially like their version of Magic the Gathering and they're doing like a big event for it. And so uh I'm peace now around noon to actually go to that. Cool, cool, cool. So that's why we're doing games daily after this though. Everybody, I see the chat getting all riled up.

This is a $40 title on the Steam description is as follows. Elden Ring Night Reigns. A standalone adventure within the Elden Ring universe crafted to offer players a new gaming experience by reimagining the game's core design. Uh we got some current critic things going on. Currently at 78 on Metacritic. Wesley Leblanc, the homie at Game Informer, gave it an eight, uh, saying, \"Night reign is at its best when I'm at my best, which means From Software's take on the rogue light genre needs to meet me halfway, leaving its frustrating misgivings at the round table hold.

When the matchmaking works, when the map randomness gives you gives my trio a fighting chance, and when the storm doesn't punishingly throw an unfair wrench into the expedition, I'm excited to rise to the challenge. The reward for my efforts is the mastery, knowledge, and adrenaline I spent dozens of hours building in Elden Ring condensed into a single run. And every success is as visceral and glorious as the last. And then Mitchell Saltzman, the homie at IGN, gave it a seven, saying, \"When Elden Ring Night Reign is played exactly as it was designed to be played, it's one of the finest examples of a three-player co-op game around. The eight character classes are each fun to use and feature a surprising amount of depth despite their limited move sets. The new Night Lord boss battles are among the",

But a lack of crossplay, duo matchmaking, and built-in communication tools makes it hard to create the conditions needed to have this kind of experience unless you're bringing two real life friends on every run. And if you want to just play by yourself, I can't recommend it because of the poor solo mode balancing. All of this amounts to an ambitious spin-off that's exhilarating when you're able to create the proper conditions and one that quickly flips to incredibly frustrating when you're not.

That was actually a review for Four Swords. Let's get into your thoughts on this. Andy Cortez, you are the biggest Elden Ring fan that I know. What do you think about Elden Ring Night Re? A lot of what Mitchell Sawsman said there. I kind of I echo for sure. I think that it's a really fun game. I' If I were to give it a score right now, which I shouldn't because I haven't beat all the bosses, I'd give it uh I'd give it like an eight. I think it's a great time. recommend the hell out of it.

It's, you know, whenever people ask me, would you recommend Valerant to somebody who doesn't really have like a squad to play with? It's like, no, that's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] nightmare. Why would I wish that evil upon you? And I think for a solo player hoping to hop in, you are kind of I think your mileage may vary because as reviewers that were playing with other reviewers and other streamers and other people that know what they're doing and largely quickly get the formula of what to do. a lot easier for people like me to hop in solo to match up with other people, right, with randos cuz you hop in and right off the rip, somebody's showing that they're going to be the shot caller and they're going to be bringing up the map and they're going to be pinging the places you need to go.

Um, and that and that's all great and fun, but that's probably not going to happen a whole lot. I think that it may be really really rough for people hopping in with the general public for looking for two randos because what suddenly one It's like when you drop in Fortnite uh alone and one squadmate goes somewhere else. You're like, \"Ah, [\u00a0__\u00a0] Where are they going, dude? Why aren't they following the squad? Ah, they died over there. Oh, they left the game.

They lack of the lack of crossplay really really bad. Really awful. And I I hope that they can maybe find a way to implement that. I doubt that that happens. Um, I'm praying that the the mod gods out there get some solo offline mods going because when you're with your squad and you die, you always have the hope that somebody can res you. When you're playing solo, you die, your run is over. And it's it it's really shitty and it sucks cuz in Elder Ring, when you die, it's like, \"All right, let me go give that boss another chance. I wish I had three chances to come back as a solo player or something like that.\" or and maybe it's a different sort of a vibe whenever you're in a boss fight. I don't know.

I didn't [\u00a0__\u00a0] notice a difference when I played solo versus in trio.

What did you think of Elden Ring Night Rain? Um, so I played 23 hours. Uh, I'm going to give it a 7.5 uh out of 10.

The boss fights for each of the runs are some of the some of my favorite from soft bosses I think I've encountered, right? And they're all tuned toward um multiplayer. like it feels more tuned toward all right, you got threeperson parties as opposed to being like, you know, like one-on-one like you're typically playing or one and a companion, which feels like you're bowling the bosses sometimes in Elder Ring. Here there it feels like there's a bit more strategy as far as all right, this boss is going to split into three and so now it is 3v3 and like each of us have to manage like one part of this boss or like all right, it is uh we need two people that are doing long",

And I think that stuff is [\u00a0__\u00a0] awesome. I think the bosses the boss designs were really cool even though I think that I wish the final boss arenas were more are more varied, right?

And I don't say Fortnite as in it's the same genre cuz it's not, right? This is it's a weirdass game, right? It is Elder Ring, but it is a rogike and it is a three-player co-op game. So when Andy says this game is hard, think about those three things because Elder Ring already by itself is a [\u00a0__\u00a0] hard game. You add in a rogike element to it to where you know Andy's talking about and I'm talking about like we're not we've not beaten all the bosses yet. Think about the fact that these runs are 45 minutes long and you get to a boss and like these are Elder Ring",

And my health is a sliver. I can either try and dodge, like use my last stamina to dodge and then try to get a heal or I panic and I heal immediately. And what did I do? I panicked and I healed immediately. Got hit down and guess what? Like that run is just done. It's not like Elden Ring where it's like, \"All right, cool. I died. I'm just going to go back again and try that boss over and over again.\" And like this [\u00a0__\u00a0] is actually like really really tough when you think about the fact that yeah, you have to rely on two",

You had to rely on other people. It's rogue light. It's Elder Ring. So this [\u00a0__\u00a0] is tough. Um but when I think about the the the ways in which I don't love this game as much, it is the ways that they try to adapt this into multiplayer. It is the fact that there's no crossplay. And I think it's even more deeming to when you think about sort of the ven diagram that this game hits because in a weird way when I think about who this game is for I think it's a really specific audience. Like I think this game is for me and Andy and not really anybody else that's not me or Andy. Like you have to like one you have to be a fan of Elder Ring. Like you have to love Elder Ring.

And that is like that's me to some extent, right? Like I like that experience and I like the moment to moment here. But at the same time, there are things like the wall jump where because this game is way more fast-paced and way more about like getting around the map pretty quickly and going from place to place. Uh they've added in a wall jump where it's exactly how it sounds, right? If you jump against the wall, you can kind of like climb up. It is very janky and it doesn't work the way that you",

Um, that said, right, like there there are so many things that I still still do love. I love the character classes. I think the the there's a class here um called Oh, it's not Iron Eye. Iron Eye. Well, Ironize the long range. I'm thinking of the exeutor. The executor because we can talk about this, right? Yeah.

I am not a range person. I want katanas all day.

All right, let's maybe do let's do two iron eye actually. Like let's do two range and then one melee because like that see like having range on like a flying enemy is going to be ideal, right?

But like I for me there wasn't a go-to because I do think that different bosses are going to require different strategies. The Discord seemed pretty unanimous on Iron Eye being the goated of them all. Who's the archer? Yeah, the Discord seemed like you're [\u00a0__\u00a0] up if you don't have at least an Iron Eye on your squad.

She has a very weird way of doing magic. She isn't just like her abilities are if blessing burns an enemy and if blessing is burning an enemy and they're kind of caught on fire, she can absorb the fire into like this trinity thing on the bottom of her screen.

And then the magic, if somebody just uses normal magic, if she if Mike uses normal magic on the enemy, he can then absorb that magic and then you kind of let that blast go and it's like this floating orb of depending on the elements you're using. You see the the different colors in this orb and it kind of like rotates around the charact the enemies and it hurts them a lot. It's a weird kind of mechanic and it's definitely not straightforward that as your usual just Mike spamming the pebble ability which is just like a kind of like spell uh thing.

CJ Splitz on says, \"Uh, would this be more user friendly if it was designed more like Monster Hunter with a big hub world and character customization?\" I mean, I haven't you played more Monster Hunter than I have. Um, I mean that you're asking for a different game, I guess, at that point.

If you're playing solo, I think there will be a lot of different ways to kind of change the the way the game is played. This would be a different game also, but I was thinking about this as I was like I was just watching videos of Night Rain before this. And as I was watching one of the boss fights, I was like, man, I would just love for this to be a boss rush game.

I I also kind of wish that it it was more of the traditional rogike Hades structure as opposed to the free exploration kind of battle royale R. I prefer the rog light RNG as opposed to the battle royale RNG where with the battle royale RNG when the world summons in different elemental camps that you can go take down will pop up and it's like ah [\u00a0__\u00a0] we didn't get any fire camps this time around. that sucks.

But no, Elder Ring is Elden Ring. Like I still have a a no summons run that from last year that I plan on getting back to sometime. Um yeah, I I definitely think that um like I saw somebody in chat asked, \"Will this be a success if will you consider it a success if people stop playing a month from now?\" Yeah, because there's eight bosses and when you beat the eight bosses, I don't blame anybody for moving on. like this isn't a they've not sold it or pitched it as like an ongoing live thing.
