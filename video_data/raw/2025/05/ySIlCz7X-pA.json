Who doesn't have energy for this?\" We go around the table and we're like, \"Mike, Mike, do you want to be on this?\" Mike's like, \"Whatever you guys need is totally fine.\" And you guys were like, \"Let's just rock it, the three of us.

We also have an office pool going on. I don't know if you heard, but today we kicked off the shows with a fun office pool on who can guess when Snowike Mike will throw in the towel and officially give up walking. Interesting.

This is what I'll factor in is that the cut scenes, this is a Cojima game. You got some long cut scenes. Long cut scenes. That's true. But he will walk during the cut scenes if the character walks.

Yep. So my question to you is, has Greg Miller gone too far with the Tim Farewell Tour? Let's have a conversation. Let's go behind the scenes. Let's go the scenes. Let's feel this out.

Like he went like this and looked around. It is so Pavlovian now that anything that's out of the ordinary here is terrifying to him. Like legitimately probably causing him to not be able to sleep at night, which I think is hilarious. But I wonder from your guys's perspective as more I would say well put together human beings. Do you think Greg's taking it too far? It's infected me as well because today uh we were doing a thing where uh we were reading out Bless was reading out a bunch of the details of Grand Theft Auto 6's characters, right?

It turned red almost like in review and I got scared. One of the chances that he can't stop. One of the changes that he's pressing a button and it's just not working. It doesn't stop immediately. There's like a transition period. But the whole set turned red and I got so scared because in the chat was Greg. Clearly, he was there cuz he was saying AUV PPP and I got so scared. I was like, is this a Greg bit? Is he calling in? Is this continuing the whole thing? So, it's it's seeped into not just him. I think it's just all of us a little bit.

And I worry that we're all doing that now. I we're all just letting Greg run a muck just so that he doesn't turn his sights on Blessing or Roger or me or he's turned his sights on me before. Has he? Yeah. When he threw the buzzer and he threw a tantrum. Oh, that's true. Him and I have have been have been not not, you know, seeing eye to eye for a few years now, so he can turn on me anytime.

M and I I I think for me this has been the game showdown season where I've realized that uh this office is just the Greg Miller circus where we just let him do whatever he wants and he just goes crazy with it and every day is you know some new clownery that's going on in the Greg Miller circus and that's the thing that I worry about a bit more is like we the war of escalation the the war of escalation uh the amount of ground that we've given him the amount of how much of this how much of Greg uh like is I guess how much of it is him feeling like he needs to",
