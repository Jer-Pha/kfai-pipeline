Um and the fact that he now loves 10 as much as I love 10. Yeah. Makes me very very happy. So maybe it'll be less of a bloody war and more of like a nice little truce. So I think they need to give you a training stream because when we did the foundations box and me and Blessing learned to play, that was so helpful. Yeah. Like cuz it just step by step. Here you go. How do you go? And that's when I fell in love with it and bought, you know, got the arena. I mean, I love that you actually play. Like that's incredibly cool and random as hell. Like very cool. Yeah.

Um, I think the coolest thing that they are introducing is difficulty modes. The standard mode will be I believe like difficulty two. There will be an easier difficulty below it and then they will go even more extreme if you want more of a challenge of the world. Well, for the challenge runners honestly cuz like I think the game's plenty hard as it is. But for the challenge runners, I think there's been such an awesome uh the true sickos out there. There's been a really awesome economy with like a lot of great speedr runners who play through a lot of bosses. Uh this is one of the um first bosses that you will encounter in the zoo.

And it was actually the same boss room of another boss that we fought earlier on the other side of the room of the like in group one. And I started off in group one where it's like you you just do the boss rushes. You play up to three bosses with five difficulty levels. You start, you know, it starts off at three and then you can, you know, maybe you want to see all the bosses, drop it to difficulty two, maybe down to one or whatever. I I didn't do that cuz I just I I lost track of time and then by the time you lost the sauce as I was beating. How long did you have with it? Uh 1 hour on each side.

That weapon kicks so much ass. The pin wheel weapon. It charges by running. So it gets stronger as you kind of start to sprint. On the top left corner, you see like a little Roman number three right now. If you run a bit more, it sort of like speeds up and becomes a number four and gets stronger. It It rocked. The weapon choices are great. I wish we had more time with the exploration section of it cuz I think the thing one of the things that really sets Liza P apart from a lot of other Souls likes uh is not only that it it's real good but it uh the weapon experimentation because so much of Liza P is well I love the handle on this weapon and I love the stats but the blade isn't really what I'm looking for. let me",

That's cool. And I love that about it. We weren't there just wasn't enough time to sort of like look into the systems there cuz there's a lot of new weapons, a lot of cool looking things. Uh the pin wheel weapon like I mentioned earlier, I I did end up using a weapon that it's called a Laureni bolt blade and it's like a little stabbing kind of a like a long range little poker uh thing, but as I was running uh with the weapon, the creator, the lead director of the game walked behind me and was like, \"When you're running, hold right trigger.\" And so I'm running and I hold right trigger and get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of my",

It also sold more in units in April than the original Oblivion managed in its first 15 months and brought in more money than the original Oblivion did in its first 14 months. While that's admittedly not a huge shock given the massively larger install base Oblivion sold into now compared to 2006, it's still an incredible feat. The remainder of April's top 20 presents some fascinating twists on the usual suspects we see on the charts. In second place for the month was Fortza Horizon 5, up from number 42 last month due to its PlayStation 5 launch.

Microsoft has announced Retro Classics with Game Pass, a collaboration with Antream Arcade to bring a collection of over 50 classic Activision games from the 80s and 90s to Game Pass members. The list includes the likes of Commando, Grand Prix, Kaboom, Mech Warrior 2, 31st Century Combat, and Pitfall. Some of the games go back 45 years.

I do really wonder if Xbox were to allow people to like buy games on Steam on their platforms, like at what point are Xbox really just like getting cut too much uh in in terms of like being able to themselves just own all the profit or is that all just baked into what they're doing similar to how we run our business where the kind of funny membership is on Patreon, YouTube, uh Spotify or Apple?

Nintendo then officially announced the Switch 2 title Donkey Kong Bonanza at in April along with the official reveal of Donkey Kong's new design which appears to be a cross between the version seen in the Super Mario Brothers movie and that scene in pre-Don Kong Country artwork.

We worked together with the team that made 3D Mario. With that technology that was available at that time, we were able to make Donkey Kong more expressive. And going back to that, going back to the design that Rare came up with, we re-evaluated what can we do with the design to make it more expressive.

No. I was hoping that was a reference you would understand. Mother's Day from last year, a podcast. I I I don't know. Okay, but that does remind me of something I want to read.
