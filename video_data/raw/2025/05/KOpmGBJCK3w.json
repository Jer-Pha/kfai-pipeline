Nick is like in the way of is getting Mike Wazowski right now. 87 hours. I think we let it run a little bit sometimes. So, like, let's not take that number for real. We also fast forward to the computer. Maybe that accounts it. Did we get a screen grab enough? Did anyone get a screen grab? Yeah, we'll get it off. We can always run it back, too. We can run it back. It's on YouTube. We're available. Maybe you don't have the power. All [Music] right. That's great. That's great. That's great. That's great. That's a beautiful run right there. That's supposed to be blessing right there, by the way. That's all good. I don't know why Elm is the spice back there. Of course, congratulations to Nick, the whole team here. Kind of funny. Thank you to Andy for going so hard on all the cool animations and artwork in there. To Barrett running our final stream and Kevin",

And thank you guys for hanging in here with me and throughout the week. Yeah. A little longer than we thought it was going to, but uh it was fun. And uh hey, enjoy your Memorial Day weekend. Oh, by the way, if you want one of these bad boys, I think we're going to probably pull them off the site by Friday because we're done with this now.",
