Why is this so bad? Why is there zero flavor?\" Crazy. We So that was bad. So that Denny's I would say Red Robin is better than Denny's because I would have I ate the entire burger and I like the fries and the pizza was like not It was awful, but it was also had pepperoni that was pretty good.

The idea of elevating the corn dog in such a way where all of a sudden there is uh French fries, mashed up French fries surrounding the outside of this corn dog. Uh we've taken the corn dog and just dipped it in a bunch of Cheeto flakes flakes. Then for some reason we decided to make a a half and half where it's we cut the dog in half and then on the top half of the corn dog it's just cheese because we wanted to do fried cheese sticks but who wants just a cheese stick so let's do half and half and it's like no it should be the dog surrounded by cheese that's a true half and half and they said no it's half cheese half dog and that",
