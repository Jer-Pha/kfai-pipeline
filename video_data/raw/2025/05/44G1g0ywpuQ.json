I wasn't going to, but I put it on while I was cleaning and I loved it and I was enthralled and this that and the other.\" Like just fun to talk to developers about their game. So, thank you for supporting this. Yeah, that's uh special to hear, Greg. And it's been a special couple of weeks to celebrate this, to get it out there to the public, and most importantly talk with that team because uh I'm someone who has really loved this game since the beginning and to hear all the stories behind the scenes alongside you uh asking some incredible questions.

I'm not going to dive in because I want to have that noob perspective, someone who's who's going to be asking questions and not know everything. Mike, you can be the expert, but when it's all said and done, I want to stream this game. I love that. Said, let's go. And here we are streaming today. Yeah. So, you're How are we doing this?

So, it doesn't matter which uh alliance you chose, where you're at, we can meet up. But I think they've done a really good job at now onboarding new players with a fresh tutorial. And so, I think the best move is let's start fresh, Greg. Let's make brand new characters. Jump in. I I'm making a new one right alongside you, Greg, is right. I love that. I love that.

So I just said no more. I I need to listen cuz the cool part about what I enjoy here is this game has fully voiced missions and like I don't want to call them cut scenes cuz they're just like the moments you go talk to NPCs and I really loved that about this game Kevin because for me on World of Warcraft that was a game that I wanted to sell my soul to but it's so much reading as you know Kevin too much reading and so I never got that feeling like I do with Elder Scrolls where you could just sit down be hold the",

We're not sitting around enjoying anything. Just get after it. And so, yeah, these are some of my moments, right? Lola respect nothing.
