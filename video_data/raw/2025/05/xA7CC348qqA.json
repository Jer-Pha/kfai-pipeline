Even though parts of it I would just do differently, but like when I go through this, I can't get mad at it. I think Rockstar, it's almost it's the same way that I think we talk about the MCU a lot of the times where it's like your games are in tiers. You have the tier one Rockstar games, which are those top three that we have listed there, right? Um, oh, I would also put San Andreas in that, but whatever. Uh, you got the tier two, you got the tier three, and we kind of all know where those games land um in that ecosystem. And I think this list gets a",

I forgot about the other thing about the other stuff. Yeah. Yeah. The whole first half table tennis just get absolutely doors blown off. Well, after this I'm going to go home and play some table tennis. I guess try out table tennis if you get a chance to jump into it. What's the There has never been a better time to hop into Rockstar's table tennis. I mean, is there cuz I don't know how how to play that. I have an Xbox 360 on my desk.

They should have put They honestly should have put the trilogy a lot lower for that remaster that they did with the trilogy where everything just looked awful. They should have ranked the trilogy, the GTA trilogy. Terrible rain effect. Oh, they didn't develop that one. Remember, Bless? Oh, you're right. That was that was Grove Street Games. remember that?

Well, he asked if it was going to be on PC, so I take a look. Yeah. Is there a PC version of Rockstar Table Tennis? There's like a little Steam Deck option you can get into. Here we I see a couple of super chats. Dolphin Corn says, \"RDR2 number one, please guys, is the GOAT of Rockstar.\" And then Mellow Fellow says, \"Do we ever get a Bully sequel? And if so, is there any chance it's a GTA game? Takes place in college, maybe. GTA 7 and Bully are the same game.\" No. Dude, I really for a second I remember living in that time and GTA is getting so much backlash from Congress people about the violence and the strippers and prostitute.

Yeah. Everybody thought like you're going to make a game about a bully after we've seen all the other crazy like you're about to make this one of the most controversial games ever. And like that's I remember before it came out I us thinking like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] this game's going to get insane. I remember going to GameStop with my sister.

This looks like it's going to be like kind of messed up or whatever.\" And I look at her, I'm like, \"I got GTA at home. I've been playing San Andreas for the last two years.\" And then they flipped it on you. It's all about fighting back against bullying. Bless. Exactly. Exactly.
