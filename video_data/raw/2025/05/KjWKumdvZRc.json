Like what what what what's the level of Mike giving you a high five or a low five? I love giving a good crisp high five. It's my passion in life. You want to hurt me. I know you do. One of my top five passions giving a nice crisp high five. You see it through and you just Yeah, but do the low five. Do a low five, but do it how you did it to me. Bear gets it. You likes the pain. You got to get a nice crispy high five to start your day sometimes. And of course, that's what Mike and Roger are going to give you during today's kind of funny games cast because today we're talking about our Death Stranding experience.

That's why we're bringing the hype in 2025. Exactly. I thought I was above Death Stranding when I saw Die Hard, man. And I saw Mama and I saw these dumb names. I'm like, \"Oh, why would I play that stinker?\" And I play it and I'm like, \"Oh my gosh, my whole life has changed before my eyes.\" I said, \"I'm too dumb to understand this game.\" And then we played it and I said, \"I love this game.\" Yeah, I'm the right amount of dumb.

I really wanted to grab the controller, but I didn't want you to take away my shine because I know all the jabronies out there watching and listening know if I took a step off of that treadmill and let you walk, they would have said, \"Oh, well, Mike didn't actually walk step for step with",

So, in the beginning of this year, uh for kind of funny day, we had a bunch of promises and kind of laid out the next year of kind of funny uh with a few uh big events, right? We talked about Game Showdown.

So I wanted to really put my time in and and actually play Death Stranding. And I wanted to do it in some type of marathon stream because I know if I start I'm probably going to stop halfway through and then never actually finish it. So I wanted that accountability. So, I wanted to sit down with you or I guess stand up with you and uh have you walk and I play. And I thought that was that was create something something special and something unique.

We'll probably do a tier list of all the food that we ordered and ate during this entire eat. Be big. You got to eat. You got you got to carb load. People say you carb load before the marathon. We carb load during the marathon. We were taking, you know, you have the they have the water stations where like the kids hand you like the Gatorade or whatever. People were handing us [\u00a0__\u00a0] Red Robins fries. It was incredible. We needed to be our biggest supporters.

Uh well, you know, how how much of the the intro was ordering more food? Yeah. Okay. Well, that's again, you have to carload, right? You got to car even though Mike wasn't walking during the last one. We got to car. We need to figure out what these corn dogs were all about. Yeah. Again, we will do a ranking by the ending of this. So, which is the best uh dinners that we had, but I was I was very excited about this cuz I wanted to play this game and it looked interesting. Um, and Mike, I don't know what your impressions of this game are or like what you came into it with, like what you played a little bit of Death Stranding on stream a while ago.

And so I I put it down and I watched Miles Luna, who I got the idea from to do the walk-athon marathon stream. And I when you said, \"Oh, I want to be prepared for Death Stranding 2.\" I thought, man, this is the perfect win-win scenario, right? Me and Roger both get to play the game together and we can do a walk-athon marathon stream. So, like, let's make great content out of this. And so, I pushed you hard of let's do this in one weekend. And you said, Mike, like, why don't we just try one little 10-hour stream, see if it's a hit or not, and we'll go from there.

There's no better time for people to get caught up to get you and I prepared and kind of build the excitement for it. And also, you know, that's kind of my role here is to try to find fun and engaging ways to create content on the live stream side of things that our audience can have fun with, the team can have fun with. And it just seemed like a perfect blend of you and I together all weekend long, minimal resources, right? Greg, Tim, uh we we only called Barrett about seven times, you know, so we only a couple of times. He called you for help, but then we didn't want to bother you. It was too late.

He was actively looking at his his phone and then decided to say no. And so for me, it was exciting, right? This is exactly what I wanted to do as something on the content side of things for kind of funny. I thought it was going to be really fun and exciting. And then on the flip side, I get to experience Death Stranding, right? play in quotes there, but like really I get to experience Death Stranding with you, one of my best friends, and also prepare for Death Stranding, too.

How much will I walk? How little will I walk? How long is a Kajjima cutscene in a walking simulator game? We learned they're pretty long. But then we also learned that Roger doesn't follow the simplest path. Okay, because here's the problem, Chad. Roger's talking a lot. He's chirping a lot about like, \"Oh, Mike, you didn't play the game.\" Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it's like, if I played that game, I would be cutting paths that people have never seen before, Roger. I would be following the most efficient path from point A to point B.

I forget who said it in chat, but it was such a a clicking moment for me of why I was digging this game so much. And if I'm at the point now where of course we have the sequel, so I I shouldn't probably go back and replay some of it, but I really want to because uh the chatter said uh this game is uh going to uh picking up your groceries from the car and bringing it all into the house in one trip simulator.

I think a lot of people get caught up in the first one at the beginning of the game and I found this the most fascinating. like they give you three paths and you kind of go oh okay like I see the vision but then after that they just like good luck figure it out you can go any way you want and then and then they build on that of like now you can build all these things I found that so fascinating and cool that it's just the ultimate sandbox of go whatever you want to do try to climb this Rogers got too many boxes on the back of his head and he's in a cave and he's",

Because you are seeing it through the eyes of BB. You are in the the tube and you're going okay well I guess this is the baby. like what's going on and to see it more build out and die hardman and then the story with the president like oh man this is crazy I love it but I also think that that is a little bit of my criticism towards the ending of the game I think that's one of my criticisms of the game kind of like start to snowball a little bit right I still love this game I think I would say if I were to give it a score on the kind of funny scale I would say it's like a a nine out of 10 for sure like it's an amazing video game but that last kick of the",

So I got most of it, right? But we just kept on showing the same thing sort of. And like there was a moment where they explained I guess the BB of it all, right? They show it.

I don't want you to hold back anymore because I know you're doing so well at keeping it all hidden and kind of shadowed off, but like let's talk Take the jacket off, Roger.
