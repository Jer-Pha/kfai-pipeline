So I made charts of like how often how many games that they released per year. And lo and behold, the number of games released has reduced significantly since they stopped having both handhelds and home consoles.

At the moment, it seems there are three prototype devices in development for Microsoft's Gen 10 effort with the handheld being parked for now. Indeed, Microsoft still Microsoft still wants to build its own Xbox handheld in the future. Uh but Microsoft has decided to prioritize its teams to improve Windows 11 gaming performance especially especially for devices like the ASUS partner device project Kennedon.

Project Kennon is the code name for Microsoft's partner Xbox handheld with ASUS. Uh we understand that Kenon is still targeting a launch later this year. The hardware side is essentially finished. Tentative tentatively we believe this device to be among the first using the AMD Z2 Extreme, but we are still working on solid confirmation for that.

It is always unclear uh if Microsoft's handheld was designed to be a native Windows 11 PC gaming style handheld or a more native Xbox console style experience, but we potentially now have an answer. It seems that it was indeed meant to be a device that could run full Xbox games, but Microsoft has decided to prioritize its teams on the partner opportunity around devices like Kenon, at least for now.

It is another Xbox story. Uh speaking of Microsoft, video game workers reach historic tentative contract agreement with Microsoft. I'm getting this from the CWA Union site. In a first for the video game industry, over 300 quality assurance workers working at Microsoft subsidiary Zenamax Media, represented by Communications Workers of America, locals 2100, 21108, and 6215, announced that they have reached a tentative contract agreement with the company. Zenamax Workers United-CWA and Microsoft have been negotiating for a first contract for nearly 2 years.

So the reason that this is such a key step in all this is that people have probably seen a lot of headlines and recall you reading out you know news for years now about game studios unionizing. Famously, there were barely any unions in gaming even just a couple years ago, particularly in the United States. And there had been some unionized efforts in France, in Sweden, in some countries where unionization is just more common and widespread amongst the population. And one of the consequences of the kind of 2020 workplace reckonings that were happening a lot of studios was particularly a lot with Activision and Blizzard was a rising up of workers to",

And one of the consequences of the kind of 2020 workplace reckonings that were happening a lot of studios was particularly a lot with Activision and Blizzard was a rising up of workers to say we need to be stronger together. A union is the answer to that to push back against management to protect each other in various ways. And you first started seeing uh developers form these unions in 20 late 2020 or or maybe it was 2021. And so it's been a long time coming. The ZenMax union was not officially the QA union wasn't they didn't vote on on a union until I think January of 2023. So as you read it's then been over two years of negotiations. On April 1st of this year they voted to authorize a strike. So what happens is you have a group of workers, they vote to have a union and then just a select number of people are sitting down at the table with the company in this case Microsoft and Zenamax to try to hammer out a contract and if they don't like didn't like the way the",

The the rest of the the the union group was agreeing on that by voting for that. And so the threat of a strike was now there in, you know, for Microsoft and Zenamax to reckon with since April 1st. And is that what finally got them to this point? Pos possibly. And that's one power of a union is the the threat of pulling your labor. But of course, the other important value of a union is what guarantees it can secure workers. And you just read through a bunch of those that include the the crediting guarantee agreements over the usage of AI. It sounded like there was something in there about pay um not the full details and that's obviously a key thing and those are you know those",

We've seen some unions crop up with other studios and publishers, but largely it's happening within the Microsoft family of studios and hopefully this will lead to uh better situation for for workers who certainly get the short end of the stick a lot of the times. 100%.

I think when when people get a sense of what's in the contract and what the union secured they will either be impressed or they will say oh that doesn't seem you know worth it right and so you you have some of the vague contours there. I mean a union is not a panacea and it doesn't stop companies from you know making decisions to shut the entire operation down because they can't you know you if all the workers are unionized as we see this happen in many industries including media",

So I think we'll we'll see but certainly over the last couple of years all you had was people voting to form a union and you weren't seeing any of the benefits or drawbacks to contracts manifest at all.

And initially, several US senators, including Elizabeth Warren, were against the deal because they were hearing from unions that this was going to be bad for labor. And the way that Microsoft was able to get the unions on board and the senators off their back was to make a pledge, this neutrality pack that was referenced in what you read, where Microsoft said, \"We will not stand in the way. We will not push back against any of our worker groups trying to unionize. I mean, they're allowed to try to unionize, but companies are able to go through a lot of processes that slow the process down.\" They said, \"We won't do any of that.\" They they honored that.

And in exchange, the CWA said, \"We approve of this mega merger,\" which which was itself unusual because usually labor unions and workers are not in favor of large corporations getting larger their $69 billion acquisition. So make what you will the deal. But one of the seemingly positive outcomes of that is that Microsoft, which for 48 years or whatever before that had never had a union and in fact they tried to break up unions um that were forming has now had unions and it's the gaming developers of all the constituencies and workers at Microsoft who were the ones who were able to sort of get the camel's nose under the tent as it were and begin to spread unionization I guess through the through the company.

After patch 1.02, solo players will be able to revive themselves once, I'm sorry, once per night boss battle, and gain more runes, a form of in-game currency while playing. This has been uh a ongoing conversation here at Kind of Funny.

By contrast, Shadow of the Tree comes out, reviewers are are are crushed by its difficulty, and very quickly you have From saying, \"Okay, we'll make it easier.\" And now you have a game that is ostensibly a co-op game. It's how it's been promoted. It's how it's been designed.

And from Software's Souls games and Elden Ring, the flask is a mainstay of your kit, a refillable potion holder that acts as your main source of healing in combat. Usually, the flask is one of several consumables, and you'd cycle through them and use them mid combat. In Elden Ring Night Reign, the fl the flask is a static element.

Unfortunately, it is not playable on Quest VR because Fallout 4 isn't on that platform. But as noted by Video Gamer, Quest owners who have gaming PCs can use their Quest headsets to play Fallout London VR on Windows. And that's it. That was it for the Wii News. But I was happy to have that. I Fallout London is still getting more stuff. It's pretty cool. It's good. I got two puffs of smoke. Two puffs of smoke cuz we like that one so much. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you. Double the Xbox handheld. Don't It's still a sore subject for me. Don't bring it up, please. Uh, I'm going to jump into the super chats before we get out of here. See what's going on. If there's anything more handheld talk, we did all that. Michael James says, \"Stephen, can we get an opinion on the classic moonwalker game?",

Michael James says, \"Stephen, can we get an opinion on the classic moonwalker game? Where's emu or night dive to figure that out?\" Well, again, the unnecessary adaptation of a great work of art from one medium to the other. Fair enough. Fair enough. I mean, it's already out there. You could go get Moonwalker and just play it and have your thing, you know, allegedly. Well, I'm saying just like the Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. Fair enough. Uh Kab says, \"Big Brain, there is no P uh Persona 4 remake. It's a remaster.\" But again, I mean, yeah, still a weird roll out. Oh, it's a little weird. Yeah, that would be that would be weird if it's a semantics technicality like that. Yeah, gotcha. And the final one I'm going to read here before I go to your wrong comes from Motor World Hype.

Uh I know next or no, yeah, post week, not next week, the week after SGF, I have him booked at least on one reaction thing. So you'll hear from Paris. He'll come in with some I have Paris's hairline. Does that count? No. No. You're you're trouncing Paris in hair. You got way more hair. I got a little bit. There's a little bit of embarrassing that guy. How bald he is.
