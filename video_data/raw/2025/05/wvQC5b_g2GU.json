I'm joined with the biggest Superman fan I know, Greg Miller. Hi, Tim. How are you? I'm very good, but I'm sure not as good as you. Well, I'm not great. It's 12:17 as we record this. I have had to dodge everything, every question. I can't open Blue Sky. I can't look at Instagram. I I'll, you know, half-hazardly open it. It's either James Gun or David Korn. I see the DC Studios logo. I rip away. Yeah, you made me wait this long. You have not seen it yet. We can't do this trailer reaction live because last time we did a Superman one, we got in a little bit of trouble. Um, so we had to stop that. Um, so what we're doing now is recording it. We're going to post it and you guys can watch. Um, we're also doing our break or reactions and breakdowns to Iron Hart, Spider-Man Noir, and uh, The Peacemaker, uh, season 2 trailer. That'll be in",

No, but I'm just assume, I mean, even based on last trailer, I'm like, Mr. Metamorpho. I'm like, I don't know what you're talking Mr. Just Mr. Terrific. Mr. Yeah, Mr. Terrific. That's a good guy.

You know that where I stand on all this, this not the DC universe I would have made. This looks very much like a DC universe I would have made, right? Uh I'm not at all if you're new around here and you're listening. This isn't me saying, \"Oh man, James Gun copied me.\" That's not it.

When's the last time we saw Superman get mad but not like get angry. You know what I like especially when it's Lois here playing reporter, playing Lois Lane, playing the questions that he would be asked by the president, by the world at large. You know, I think they're already doing it there. This is this scene right there, the world they're establishing this trailer, and I'm not throwing shade at all by the Snider films, but it's already doing such a better job of what they were trying to do in BBS with Holly Hunter, right?

As him going in stopping this civil war or not civil war, this war between two countries again pulled right from the headlines here of what would Superman do with Russia and UK Ukraine, right, in our own world right now. And then the political ramifications, world ramifications that would have here and have him dealing with it looks like uh from this, right? dealing with what a Superman's place is in a world that is so fraught with countries, boundaries, borders, what how is this all going to work out? And then of course seeing Lex on top of that obviously pulling the strings, you'd assume and yada yada yada like [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah, this looks amazing.

But, um, there's something about the the color grading of Superman so far, everything we've seen about it that I just really appreciate because it sticks to the comic book roots of being colorful. And, you know, we've had now hundreds of superhero comic book movies. We've talked about them in depth. And I do think we get to a point where it all starts to fit into this category or this category or this category. And I don't know that this is breaking any new grounds, but for it to be a Superman movie that has this look of everything's blue and orange tinted that reminds me of like, oh, this is about to be a quality graphic novel. Like there's a style to it. Like I think of like Spider-Man blue, you know, where it's just like, all right, cool.",

I feel like it kind of just gives it a bit of an identity even if it's not like and it's it's very funny that like this is coming out in the same month as Fantastic. styiz similar um I I I feel like I can use very similar words to explain how I feel about that. Um but and I actually I think it's very apt where we have two incredibly iconic to Marvel and DC respectively like uh characters that have not really had their time to shine for one reason or another. Yeah. Well, they've had times to shine but they didn't shine in movies, right? So to to come out and and do this and have such a a great vibe from the jump I think is important.

Um but I as not the biggest Superman fan at all watching this I am like, \"Oh wow, he's acting kind of like a dude.\" And um yeah, like him in the interview, the way he's talking to Lois here, it's like it it seems a little out of character for what I would expect from Superman, but I think it's because Exactly. From what I know of Superman is I'm the only guy who loves Superman and it's because of I think su I think of Superman being this. That's the thing and that's what we've lost throughout the Snider verse. I would go as far back.

She's interviewing Superman but he's responding as Clark in these instances which is so vital to the fact that Clark Kent is Superman. Superman isn't Clark Kent. Clark Kent is a human being and I know he's not but strict with me of like he is just a person. And so the way he's he's going to talk to Lois Lane is so far different than how he's going to present himself in public, how he would talk to a different reporter, how he would talk if he was actually being interviewed and whatever he thinks, right?

You're a human being. You have this emotional spectrum that you're feeling, but you know you can't do that when you go out and represent. Kind of funny when you represent Superman, when you represent whatever's going on. Yeah. I mean, so is there anything you're surprised to see in this trailer?

Remember, of course, the big brew haha there was the framing of Superman for killing a bunch of people in a foreign space, right? And then how that made it work. The fact that we're leaning back into that with him breaking up the war here and I'm going to say it wrong, but Bo Broaria Broia, something like that. Um, is interesting.

Like it's a I think it is something ripped from the headlines in a lot of different ways of what would a Superman do in our world where there are all these conflicts. You know what I mean? It's my joke when I go back to I know no future spoilers for you. Sorry, Tim. But in Superman 4, when Superman walks into the United Nations and announces he's going to rid the world of nuclear weapons and all of the UN cheers him on, no one being like, \"This alien is ripping away our autonomy as a nation state. What are we doing?\" So to see how that falls in here to see again with, you know, I had the early on theory that Lex goes to the fortress, unleashes all the people or all the creatures Superman's either put in the Phantom Zone or",

I still think that's probably what's happening, but it's interesting that it's more based off of this and then so then you get to, you know, him getting hit in the head with the trash when he walks in. Is that him fighting these creatures and Lex saying, \"Hey, look at these creatures he put out.\" Or is it the hammer of Brovaria shows up, beats the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of Superman for a while, [\u00a0__\u00a0] up Metropolis, and then it is him dealing with the fact that people are pissed that this fight's been brought to our door.

Maybe he didn't maybe Superman did actually just go get involved and now Lex is using that as his opportunity to bring in Ultram Man to bring in the engineer to have them upset the balance of power here.

You saw him in the Peacemaker teaser trailer uh that debuted before uh Walking Dead. Yes, Last of Us. There I can only keep so many things straight. Anyways, with him flanked by Hawk Girl and uh Guy Gardner, of course, the rumor forever has been that he's the funding this Justice League, so it's not even the real Justice League.

Again, I think we're just getting a snippet here, but damn, the chemistry between these two, right? Uh, there was a fun one. Uh, pause. I love this little Easter egg I caught in the back there. The framed Lois, but with clouds. I assume at some point Superman had to write a message to Lois or maybe it was just for fun.

Because Lex just told the world he let all these things out of the Phantom Zone that he's been saving. He should have killed these creatures. He should have euthanized him and said he's been holding him in his jail in the Arctic. Or is it because of uh interfering in this war and now having the hammer of Braavaria come to your door?

If you remember when we watched Creature Commandos, then the I I caught up on all the episodes at the time because they were about to drop the teaser for Superman and there was this thing and I thought for a second maybe that was the fact it wasn't. And then so many people had called out to me uh that from the shooting of the movie they had a newspaper article written by Clark Kent about the hammer of Brovaria being pissed off that Superman got involved in this war. He was coming over here and [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] up then in fighting Superman.

This is leading into, of course, uh, him having this confrontation we saw with Green Lantern, Guygardner, and Huck Girl when they walk in and Guy Gardner goes like that and blocks out the windows. Yeah, this one right here. I guess I could have just let it play, but I don't I haven't memorized the new trailer I just watched. Interesting that they say the department or whatever director of defense or whatever his official title is.

That's probably going to be a good thing for the people that the many majority of people that did not watch Creature Commandos hopefully fall in love with watching Superman and then want more of this and it'll all kind of connect Peacemaker as well.

So, because of the U on his chest, which of course makes sense and I get, but it's just such a different interpretation of Ultram Man as we currently know him in comics. Ultramman generally is the Earth three Superman from the evil group of everybody. He's he's the evil Superman flanked by the evil Wonder Woman flank and they all have the little twists on their names, right?

This portal exit is into a dark void-like plane that Superman is later briefly shown flying through amid the debris of multiple buildings. This combined with the hints from Peacemaker season 2's trailer could indicate that Superman is already hinting at multiversal possibilities in DC's future. I come down several different ways on this. Right. First off, I look at this and it kind of looks like boom tube technology. Not exactly.

May 14th. The Iron Heart one we'll put up tomorrow. Uh, just cuz I feel like this was such a substantial conversation, I don't want to step on it. Sure. Great.
