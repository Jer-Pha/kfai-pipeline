This is one of those games that looked unbelievable that felt way too ambitious to possibly be real. 100%. But Greg Miller has not played it. I have. I've played three hours of it. Three hours of a real video game, Hell is Us. Of a real video game called Hell Is Us. I traveled to Montreal to do it right before PAX East and I want to hear all about it. That's what's shocking to me is that this game has been justestating, is it real? What is it? Should we be excited? Should we not blah?

I expected one of you to ask me about it. No one asked me. I think enough time passed. Yeah, it was a weird it was weird timing, which is great. I did ask Danny Pena how he liked it cuz I did see him at the Liza P event and that was uh that that was more like kind of in my mind of like, oh yeah, Greg posted that little story on Instagram. I saw that. Yeah, I'm appreciative that I haven't had a chance to talk to any of you about this because it makes my next words all the more powerful. Oh no.

I think it's going to have, you know, it's faults and this and that, but they're doing something very special from the three hours I played. Maybe it all falls apart. Maybe it doesn't do what we want from there. But I have never previewed a game that I think speaks to so many of us here for entirely different reasons. It it has the Perry Poppy stuff that Andy and Bless love, right? It's got the combat in general that I think you like so much from your action. Exactly. Right. It's got this exploration that I am all about. It has the puzzles to make blessing happy in the Resident Evil way of you find this crest, you know, there's another one for this door.

Um, this game so far based on three hours is very, very, very special and I cannot wait to play the entire thing and get super super deep into it. Now, the biggest hook about this though was when we were sort of seeing more of that developer deep dive and less of the just trailer cuz a trailer always looked sort of, you know, wa this looks really pretty and wow, they're going for all these kind of different things. This looks pretty damn hype. But then when the developers talked about it, they said, \"This game doesn't tell you anything. This game is designed from the ground up to be all about exploration and all about you sort of seeking out your own curiosities.

But how much does this game feel like, oh, they really want you to look at signpostings and things like that? Well, I mean, that is this game and it's why I think it works so well for me jumping into a gameplay style I'm not great at. Uh, we'll get to that though, right? Uh, at the presentation, one of the things uh JBB, who's the guy you always see in these things, Jonathan, uh, talking about was the idea that this game is 50% combat and 50% exploration. like you are me as you've said and they say throughout all the videos which I encourage you to go watch right there are no magic compass there is no quest marker in",

But as I got up here and I found this, and this isn't my footage, this is the B-roll they sent over. You approach over there. Watch Rebecca react. So, let hit play now.

And to before we even get into more of the there's nothing there. I think that is what if they nail this, which I think they're going to. I think they've got a head on their shoulders and they clearly care. What we're building to right now is going to be a 2025 narrative about the incredible power of an of small teams, passionate teams. Rogue Factor is 50 people. They have done everything in quotes inhouse. Obviously they have voice actors like Elias Tuxus of course in there. He's the main character uh that you play here as Remy. I don't think I knew that.

And they gave such a great presentation laying out this, you know, uh, calamity that you're in, this civil war, you're involved in, this fact that it's set in 1993, right?

But you don't have this like giant map to pop up into and look at the map that you just pulled up there that had like the the red arrow. Yeah.

I just came off of Oblivion. We just did Outer Worlds review. Starfield's got new stuff going on. I started up New Vegas on my ROG on the plane ride over. I was doing Oblivion and so was Dan.

Of what I think traditionally would be a side quest, right? They don't really term it or show that or do whatever. But you walk up to this fiddler involved in this civil war.

I need to know why they did this. And so he becomes a excuse me he gets involved in the military. Uh eventually when the civil war breaks out he sees this as his chance to get in, right? So he joins up with the peacekeepers knowing he's going to hop the wall and go in and figure it out. All he knows is that his dad was a blacksmith in this small town, right? So even getting there originally, it's like where is this town? You have to try to figure that out. When you get into this and you find the civil war, right, it is grotesque and",

Just dozens and dozens of bodies. Not in body bags like the Division, nothing like just [\u00a0__\u00a0] bodies. And there's one dude there holding I think it's his wife with his daughter's corpse in front of him sobbing.

And so, you know, you don't set this as the main quest at any point.

In action, you'll see that black uh open section of health and stamina flash white, and that's when you need to hit the healing pulse to take back the health from these people.

Uh this is less about the combat but more just about what you're combating. Sure. Um it watching this game seems a little bit weird. Seems a little bit anacronistic looking at the Okay, cool. You're in this civil war of of having uh the these real serious like death and bodies and babies dying and all this stuff and then you're fighting the the nobodyies from Kingdom Hearts 2. Like it does that does it make sense in context or Yes. So the idea is",

So it's like they you the world doesn't know what's going on in there. What is that? Just a bunch of crabs. What Andy? No, the world doesn't know what's going on there. So they know a civil war broke out, but it's, you know, the peacekeepers I was talking about. if memory serves like they don't the whole big deal here is that you know you uh jump over the wall and run in. The peacekeepers are on the outside. No one knows what's going on inside. So when our boy uh Remy goes in, right, he learns really quickly like, \"Oh, this isn't just a civil war. There's been a calamity. There's these weird monsters going around. There's all these there's a portal over here and I don't know what it does. There's dungeons.",

In this art book, I already saw two different melee weapons. What does progression look like? What does item discovery look like? We didn't get super into progression uh on the weapons. There are I believe I don't want to speak out of turn. Like I do have a good screenshot of it here. I believe when I'm going through your weapons level up as you use them. So the more you're using it, the more Yeah, there's a grade on here. It goes up. You're also finding different things. They're inflicted with different things.

I wasn't finding a ton, but like when I think when they dropped me into the dungeon, which is hours after what I've been playing, I believe I had more to play with. And you've seen it there where there's like a big battle axe, there's a sword, there's a bigger sword, there's a dagger. I'm not sure how much we'll be shaking it up, but again, that wasn't what spoke to me, so I wasn't really running through. Does it feel too ambitious? Hard to say. Uh, I think on paper. Oh, can I just say one more thing before we get out of combat? Keep that one. Put a pin in it. Uh, put a pin in it, too, for the combat. So, again, dog [\u00a0__\u00a0] at it. figuring it out.

No, just like flashing lights and distracting or whatever. Okay. Um aggro. Yeah. Uh, anyways though, I killed the other two dudes, got it down to one dude, and then I sat there just to practice pairing and practice trying to get this thing.

Well, I do, but not like a easy, medium, hard thing. They want you to go in and customize this. They're not trying to make if if you if you are a traditional exploration gamer like me and you're not good at pairing, you can go in and turn stuff down. So, the death system reads like this, right? Upon defeat, any conversation, datam discovered, or puzzles completed will all be preserved regardless of save points used. However, enemies eliminated, weapon progress, and loot gathered from enemies will be reset to the state of the last save part. Right.

Like, it's got to be Bloodborne. Come on, man. I have beaten Bloodborne. But it's that idea of like for real to take it away, like I know like we lean into characters and archetypes here where it's like I'm not drawn to the Souls game more than anything. Not because of the difficulty. I did Bloodborne and I beat Bloodborne. It's more the fact of just like I don't vibe with the world or the story they're trying to tell in their own way enough to then want to sit there and run a boss seven times until I get it or more.

I mean, the way they built it up, I would assume there are, but I could be wrong altogether on that. But to your question then of is it too ambitious, right? I would have told you based on the trailers we watched that it was too ambitious. But I would have said that about Expedition 33 as well. And Expedition 33 proved me wrong and us wrong. And now to be here having played three hours of it like I it doesn't strike me as they nailed the vertical slice of this game. Like we started from scratch, right? and played what it would have been 2 hours, hour and a half to before they jumped us to the dungeon. Maybe more, maybe less.

There's an actor he looks like like a Hollywood actor he reminds me of Samuel Jackson. Aiden Pierce vibes for sure, dude. The hat. Yeah. How are the performances? Awesome.
