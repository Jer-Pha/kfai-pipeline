            "text": "I think that it's a really fun game. If I were to give it a score right now, which I shouldn't cuz I haven't beat all the bosses, I'd give it uh I'd give it like an eight. I think it's a great time. Recommend the hell out of it. If you have a lot of people that you want to play with, don't really recommend it right now. If you are hoping to hop in solo cuz you're kind of rolling the dice on I hope my squad is good or I'm going to play solo offline, which is a nightmare and just it doesn't feel balanced at all. So, I played 23 hours. Uh, I'm going to give it a 7.5. I have beaten four of the bosses out of I believe eight. I think what saves this game is that it is from software and it has so much of the quality of Elder Ring. The boss fights for each of the runs are some of the some of my favorite from soft bosses I think I've encountered, right? And they're all tuned toward multiplayer and it is all about us like going in and doing as much uh damage as possible. And I think that stuff",
