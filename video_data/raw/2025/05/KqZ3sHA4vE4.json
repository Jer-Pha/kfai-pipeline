And we know who it's going to be. Tim. There's an S right there. Plural. Don't put plural agenda. We had the announcement that we wanted to announce. Yes, of course. Go for it. So, you you co-signed this announcement? I I did. Yeah. Okay, sweet. Uh, I'm not sure if Greg's still in the building, but the announcement was I'm excited to announce that stars plural does indeed mean three stars. Three stars. Three. That's more than Greg even was asking or pushing for. Timothy, as I said, you're the biggest Oni Musha fan I know. Mhm.
