That focus has allowed us to deliver a classic organized crime drama in the period authentic mafia rules and traditions of the era. And as you just saw, we've made some exciting gameplay updates. Whether you're using a knife or a gun, using stealth or in a shootout, this is brutal and grounded in all the best ways. It's all going to pull you in from every angle, pushing the franchise forward in a location and time painstakingly created with the utmost authenticity and detail using Unreal Engine 5.

And stay tuned between now and August as we'll have even more to tell and show. Thanks for joining us on this journey. Come in. Our top goal for every Mafia game is to deliver the promise to a player that you're going to play a classic mob movie. Mafia the Old Country is a linear crime drama set against a beautiful Sicilian backdrop. The first step for us was to make sure that we were nailing all of the things that players expect from a Mafia game. the quality of it storytelling, how immersive it is, how authentic it is. Previous mafia games have been set in big American cities. We've taken the action and we've put our story in rural Sicily in the place where the mafia began. You really feel like you're transported into another time. It feels really unique and different, but yet really familiar. Players are really going to enjoy that aspect",

Players are really going to enjoy that aspect of it. Our entry point for making these crime dramas is always the protagonist. We wanted to make sure that our main character Enzo Favara lives up to the standard which we've set in the past and I hope in some ways even exceeds that. All of the men in this room are bound by blood. Enzo grows up in a sulfur mine. He's one of a bunch of children that are sold to the mine owners at this point in history in Sicily. Their life expectancy is short and they're essentially seen as disposable. Enzo turns to crime as a means to make something of himself. The odds are stacked against him. So what does he do? He sees an opportunity for himself to gain some status, to gain some respect. Do you wish to commit to this family? I do. Swearing the oath is the chance for him to finally be accepted. He's found",

I think players are in for an emotional roller coaster. The high stakes of the mafia life present opportunities for us as storytellers to take players and put players through the ringer really in terms of what happens to the character, what happens to them in the game. You again. What makes a really compelling gameplay experience is the mix of the high-intensity combat, cover play, cover shooting set by these beautiful cinematics that make what you do in the combat so much more meaningful because you're fighting for something you really believe in. Authenticity and immersion are key. And so we wanted to take that philosophy from the storytelling and make sure that it was consistent in the gameplay. You",

There's some downbeats, there's some deep storytelling moments, and then there's some like highintensity action. And I think that's what makes Mafia missions and the general experience so interesting is that we're constantly trying to change that roller coaster experience that you're on. Enzo's proving himself with guns and we wanted the combat to feel like there was a scarcity of resources. So, you have to be more tactical in the way that you approach combat. The knife has been an integral part of gameplay. It's a part of Sicilian culture. We wanted our gameplay to be immersive, to have a life or death kind of vibe. So, when",

My flesh must burn like this saint if I do not keep my oath. Bringing 1900 Sicily to life for us, it infuses every aspect of the development. It's about the characters. It's about the music. It's about the story. It's about the setting. It's about the vistas. It's about the vehicles. It's everything. It always starts with research. It always starts with immersing ourselves in the subject matter. So whether that's reading every crime book around the Sicilian mafia, watching all of the movies, even driving the cars, firing the weapons, and then translating that into the game, that's the the development experience. We even sent some folks out to Sicily. We were then able to take all of those",

And those two things are woven together in a way that I think players are going to really enjoy. Bravery is not common in this world. And so the mafia that we see in the Mafia of the Old Country is is much different than the mafia that we see in some of the other mafia games. It's a timehonored tradition steeped in secrecy. And there's this sort of deep honor that we see within the Teresi family and within the characters there. The characters relationships with each other, the way they behave is very much influenced by that setting and that cultural difference.

We've really been able to push the boat out in terms of sort of the real tiny details on everything. You know, one of the big ones for me is Metahuman. You have characters that have really lielike expressions, micro details. You know, many times when I'm watching the game, especially on a big screen in 4K, I start to forget that they're characters rendered in an engine. and they just look like real characters in a movie. I think that's the level of immersion that we want and it allows people, I think, to really suspend their disbelief and go along for the ride.

Well, it's radically different in some ways and in other ways it's very much still in the the same vein as the other games. It has the same DNA. I think when we uh when we set out to make a mafia game and when we think about what a mafia game is, uh we really identify, you know, what the DNA of that experience is.

I think if you played other Mafia games, you'll recognize all of those things as really key uh elements of them. I think, you know, all of those are definitely true in all the games. So, when we look at what's next, we look back to this and we think, you know, how does what we're making now fit in with those and and deliver the kind of mafia experience the players want and that we want to make.

Well, the tone is we, you know, the tone is a little different to the other games, of course, but the setting is different to the other games. So that's the reason why the tone feels a little different. It's more, you know, it's got a kind of adventure vibe to it. Again, you saw in the video there, you know, right riding through the countryside, chasing that cart, for example, from the from the trailer. It's um the tone and the setting of the game has been, you know, tailored around a 1900 Sicilian setting. You know, we're not in a city anymore like the previous like the Mafia Trilogy titles.

You know we're still in the mafia universe but we've gone back a little bit of time to right to the very beginnings but also not just the beginning of that story but the story of organized crime. You know like we all have a good idea I think of like what the American mafia looks like from films and TV shows. probably less of a clear idea about what the Sicilian mafia is or what that meant.

Obviously, when we get on Sticks, it'll be a different feeling. Nobody's getting a mouse and keyboard. When we get on sticks, it'll be a different feeling. Oh, there's a undercurrent of a boo there.

We spent over like two months interviewing on all all the talents having the calls to making sure that we are selecting the the best possible fit for each of the role and I have to say that we are really lucky that we ended up with our first choices for each of the role of the main character. uh you know every game is uh very unique. Every mafia game is very unique and it's in a big part due to the cast and especially to the lead. So casting Enzo was very critical to us. uh we were looking for someone who can embody the specific Enzo journey and uh help us to set a distinct tone of the of the narrative you know and authenticity is also a huge part of our project.

I think she longs to fulfill her potential, and she's frustrated that the male-dominated society into which she was born doesn't allow her to do that. Isabella is a woman born ahead of her time. She is a loving daughter, but she's fiercely independent, so she longs for freedom from the structures of conservative society and from her father, Donzi. Alex, talk to me about Isabella. Well, yes.

So, we went out there, we've got a ton of reference, we really made it as authentic as possible, but to be honest, it's great. There's not that much artistic uh or creative interpretation required because it is such an amazing larger than life beautiful uh environment. So, yeah, it's it's it's a really really great setting for this kind of story. Tomas, what what is the research? Sure. You you guys went there, right? We saw that in some videos.

Eventually we even talk to the local historians to learn what the life was like uh back then. What we love on the Sicily is the contrast between beautiful country of the Sicily and the harsh uh life conditions the people had to face back then. It was even more obvious when the when we went down to the sulfur mines and learn how brutal and dangerous the life was there just to survive. Actually, you were there on the trip.

We we get, you know, to really represent the authenticity of the environment as you say, uh Thomas, about like creating a game experience that's very immersive, that really transports you back to the time period and particularly to that location. It's very important to actually go and see it for yourself. Is the setting working with like the themes you're trying to go with family and all that? Abs. Well, there's plenty of there's there's a whole range of stuff there. So, when we went um when we went to Sicily, we visited sulfur mines. We visited in the Greek ruins. We saw some uh images there.

I was playing it last week and it's um yeah it's a different kind of vibe. [Laughter] Uh, Nick, let's pivot to gameplay. Of course, we're all gamers here, right? We love gameplay. That's was a big deal to see the gameplay trailer today for the first time. What were you guys trying to get across with the gameplay trailer? Mhm. Well, the first thing was was to hopefully make it really clear that if you love Mafia, you're going to love Mafia: The Old Country. Right. This is this is classic this is classic Mafia gameplay. Modernized. It's uh yeah, it's it's it's brought to",

It's uh yeah, it's it's it's brought to 2025, but if you like it, if you like Mafia, you're going to love this. Um, but the other thing as well was to really show the variety of gameplay as well. The fact that, you know, there's there's knife fighting now. The combat's much more grounded and gritty. I hope that came across. You know, there's there's horses as well, which new thing, right? So, um, yeah, and and the jewels that you saw with the knife. So, I think the big thing was this is familiar, but it's better. And it's uh and also I think the other big thing really was just to really give a taste of how this setting gives a new twist on that classic formula. So yeah, I love that transition.

We're talking about, you know, a time before automatic weapons. So, but also we're talking about an environment that's very sparse, that's very rugged. And actually, we al another kind of angle we wanted to take on the design is kind of to channel something which was a bit more from the original Mafia game where combat was a little bit more challenging. It was more tactical. With Mafia 3, we went in a more kind of like bombastic sort of combat direction. and we wanted to sort of pair that back, make combat feel more uh dangerous, kind of like having to survive combat encounters rather than just blasting your way through them. So, all of those things are really kind of like designed around the setting and",

So him kind of like scrabbling around looting for kind of weapons in combat in combat scenarios for example is uh gives you a good idea about what it's like to kind of like survive through these combat encounters rather than um yeah just kind of uh shoot a shoot to win. Yeah. So um in addition I think we also saw um again in the videos but like the knife is quite a significant new addition in terms of uh combat in we wanted to make it so that the knife again it's it's kind of a Sicilian tradition. in Sicilian knife fighting is very evocative of the time period and of Sicilian gangsters generally.

You can choose from different knives in in the game. Each knife has got different attributes and skills associated with it. So, you can kind of like some knives you can throw, some knives give you uh bonuses in uh in in in other aspects of combat. Um, and then we've got this knife jeweling mode as well, which is new to the game and new to Mafia. So, you know, every now and again you come up against a kind of a boss character in missions and you have a kind of a one one-on-one kind of jewel to the death with them as well. So, that's okay. That's awesome. Uh, what's not awesome is that the there's no Tommy guns. And so, I would like to come back to that point, Nick. Thank you",

Um, it's just a much more brutal, grounded experience, I think, than maybe players are used to in a mafia game. But, uh, but again, keep saying the word authenticity, but that's that's what it was like. And I want to piggy back off that again as we continue to move through what we saw in the gameplay trailer.

Um, and it's enjoyable. I think that's the main thing. It's about trying to give more uh enjoyment as you go from A to B and as you explore the world. Just just it's it feels great and it looks great. And you have to crank them when they break down, right? The horses. No, no, no. The cars you need. We we we could have done that.

What goes into making it look like this? All right. Our goal was always to set the benchmark for the cinematic quality with our mafia games. We wanted the player uh to feel like they are stepping into and playing the the classic Mo movie uh in this settings and in this era.

So you know um the technology advanced uh a lot since the first mafia you don't say 23 years with the moving uh as to anal engine 5 it opens uh new possibilities we were not able to uh reach before you know the details we are getting now is incredible. the nites uh allowing us to model everything like the environment, characters, cars, everything that you are losing even the sense and presence of the any triangles, polygons.

Thought it was pretty clear, but let's start with that. It's not open world. I saw a buzz about that today that it was a linear one you guys said. Okay, I'll try and answer that question. So, I think the thing with this game is this, like Alex said, we started this when we came off Mafia the fifth edition. And we really took a lot of inspiration by how well, you know, that landed with people and, you know, the fact it's a focused story that takes you through. There's a world around you, but really we're pulling you through the journey. You know, we want these games are made for you to complete. We want you to see the story, right? So, um, so",

So, when you're going through Sicily, when you're playing the game, you're going along a golden path, you're you're seeing the story unfold uh in front of you, but there are things going on around you in the world. There's there's uh if you stop and and and look around, you know, there's there's people in the fields harvesting crops. There's people going around their day. You can go off the the path if you want and explore elsewhere. So, it's kind of there's this beautiful world around you, but that's not our focus.

We've got new scenarios that are entirely specific to the kind of things that happen in Sicily at the time. Actually the uh we saw some clips there of a kind of a kidnapping mission which was very common in that time. Bandits would go and kidnap people and kind of hold them to ransom. Not something that commonly happens in American crime. Um, but then we've got sort of similar scenarios to other mafia games. In some cases, some intentional remixes and revisiting of some some similar ideas.
