I think that comes down to the preference of like I really like the weird um cyberpunk um sci-fi world of Final Fantasy 7 more than the traditional Game of Thrones style fantasy of Final Fantasy 16 but I could see going either way and like I don't think it's crazy that you're more anticipating Final",
