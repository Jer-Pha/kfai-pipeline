I I put the game in 720p with like the highest or like Ultra performance mode on AMD FSR and like it still ran at around 45 frames per second so there's not a whole lot you can do to get a consistent 6D it kind of hovers around 50 55 45 frames per second um so hopefully a couple of patches will iron out some of those issues I did notice that turning on Ray tracing does impact the frames however you get about a 10 to 15 frames per second drop and from what I'm seeing I think it's just ambient occlusion Ray tracing and shadows I don't think there's a whole lot else happening with it and right now all the console people are like Andy shut your shut your mouth up I'm",
