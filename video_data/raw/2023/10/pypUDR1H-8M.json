I highly doubt that's gonna happen that's pretty amazing that's a good goal the packs or something like that I've seen people open like 500 and not do it okay so okay the the it's not entirely in our favor however since not that big so I think that we can kind of get a dent going okay what's special about it because this set is like so important and there is such a finite number to it all yeah I'm like I'm gonna go above and beyond this binder isn't just a normal binder it's like a super-sized binder yeah",
