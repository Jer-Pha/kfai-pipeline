I'm sure by the time you hear this those numbers might have already updated but we're going to start off with Dan Stapleton and IGN who gave it a 7 out of 10 and says it's never a great sign when someone recommends a game on the grounds that it gets good after more than a dozen hours but that's very much the kind of game Starfield is and I do recommend it there are a lot of forces working against it and the combination of disjointed space travel non-existent Maps aggravating Inventory management and a slow rollout of essential abilities very nearly did it in I was it was the joys of piloting a custom spaceship into and out of all sorts of morally ambiguous situations a rich sci-fi universe that eventually pull it out of a nosedive I'm glad",
