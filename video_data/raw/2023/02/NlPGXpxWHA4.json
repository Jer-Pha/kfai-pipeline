            "text": "wild Arts is a game by Omega forces it is just straight up a monster hunter game it'd be tough to call it a monster hunter-like game because it's just straight up monster hunter you kind of blur your eyes and look at it you're like yeah that's that's seems like Monster Hunter you have a bunch of different weapons you can choose from and customize fight awesome beasts that eventually transform in all their different phases so you're trying to take them out while like getting cool loot from them and then using that loot to upgrade your weapons the thing that sets it apart from a monster hunter game are these sort of magical crates that you have I think these abilities make the game what it is and make it great this is a four out of five great for me so far I'm not done with it but I'm about like 35 hours in I can't stop playing it I really really really like this game I would have given it a higher score if it didn't look ugly sometimes",
