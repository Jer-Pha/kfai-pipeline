I I it's hard for me to imagine that 2019. it's hard for me to imagine that by the time we get to this next E3 it's going to be that right like without having PlayStation Nintendo Xbox I'm probably getting ahead um what is there you're talking about third parties all right so your question Tim I would say some I'd say game awards is the biggest individual gaming",
