Michael you went to New York City I have a way to New York to play this game I am very very jealous of you I need to know everything what'd you think oh man so a little bit of backstory uh so Final Fantasy 16 Final Fantasy 16 is developed by creative business unit 3. if you all know Final Fantasy 14 is one of the greatest games of all time let's look at that Scions of the seven Dawn if there's any group of people that I'm gonna fight alongside if I'm gonna attack and deep no not Dethrone God damn let's say deep throat God hey if you all want to do that too no matter what these people want to do to God they'll be there that's under my best I ain't gonna do that but if you're down you're down you know you know what I'm saying yeah oh God I got the quick",
