I had I had my uh, you know, my group of friends and I was nerdy, and I think I was the same way. I went to private high school, you know, uniforms and all that jazz, ties every day, and it sucked. I stopped bringing a book bag home like mid junior year; I'm just like, 'I'm not gonna do this anymore,' you know what I mean? So I coasted by, but newspaper stuff I did, and that helped out. But like, you know, bunch of jerk-ass kids there, teachers who are way too young to be teaching us \u2013 they were getting caught up in the high school drama and stuff, like being little, they were being pricks, and it was just like, '**** off, I don't even want to deal with you.' Well, you know why that might be is because private schools don't have you don't have to pass certification to teach in a private school; you actually don't even have to have\"",

Yeah, ever since then, no responsibilities, yeah, like no real responsibilities, just do whatever you want. You can fail out, do really well, go party, chill, and read. Like, there are people who take it too far, one way or another. Especially people who do really well in college - that's great. College is where things really matter. High School? I would recommend just studying, getting good grades, taking classes, building bridges, making good friends... don't get hung up on some stuff.

And because lacrosse was big at our school, I don't know if it's bigger to other people; I never heard about it till American Pie, and that's weird. But you realize you were all friends, and everyone was really kind, inviting you to parties, doing all these cool things, and there was like a feeling of camaraderie there with people that I didn't think even liked me, you know? And like I do, I do look back on that, and a lot of it was like, Colin, you're cool; you just kind of keep yourself to yourself. It's like I'm not trying to be loud and obnoxious; I'm not trying to be friends with people who aren't my friends.",
