I'm Greg, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at them, and we talk it out for your amusement if you like that. Like this episode of the show. Subscribe to our channel, share us with your friends. Col are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is how the fridge handle broke from HadMeatPetrello. This is an ongoing thing that everybody out there likes to joke about. It's this stupid thing every time we put up a note here saying \"we know it's broken\" - you could stop telling us in the YouTube comments below. We like the comments, but it's broken; we get it. We don't... uh, I don't really know when it happened. It's an old fridge; it's not that old; it's maybe 20 years old; maybe that's old.",

Well, it's not see you, you think it's too expensive, you're running out here pinching pennies all the time, yeah, you're crazy. Someone's got to do it. I uh well the whole heat story is funny because when we moved in together I was like we don't use the heat, we don't use the Heat, and if I hear any of you talking about it, I'll tell you how cold it is in Boston, and then like two weeks later you were the first person to turn on the heat, it's too cold. Ran out there, it was true, I was a jerk. But you know what? I feel like even thinking about appliances is too adult for me. I'm 29 years old, Greg, I'm ready for a new fridge. Well, we don't have this place, I'm not buying anything but see this is what I always talk about Christine brought this up that it was possible that we could talk to the landlord that if we buy a new fridge take it out of the rent next month yeah we\"",

I liked went and hit him with a little punch in his face. He fell into the fridge, into the crack between the cabinets of the fridge, and the fridge moved over. Yeah, and our other two roommates were like actual men, laughing at us. St...like that. So it's possible that these kinds of things can happen, sure, these kinds of fridge-related incidents. But I think we mean, like, we started a conversation with Colin talking about the house having ants. Yeah, I think we know the kind of damage we're doing to this place on a daily basis.

I didn't want them to fall off the wall if I did. He was a handyman who his specific handyman purpose was picture friend, that's weird. Let's like he was very good at it; he's very good. He did a nice job, like what kind of business is that? Like something he does on the side at night. I mean can you sustain your business hanging up pictures? I'd hope so. How much did he charge you? I don't want to get into that now. It was like an hour, I think it was $5 for an hour. You paid a man with tools and levels and rulers $115. I would have hung up those pictures for you, but we would've done it for $20. I went and bought a laser level and put it on the wall and I had it and I'm stud finding all over the place.\"",
