So, so, The Slim Shady LP right, and Marshall Mathers the original LP are amazing records, especially especially the Marshall ones which I think you know from from \"Kill You\" all the way through to the end are fantastic records like he's a wordsmith, you know, K from Connecticut, like I like everything after that, like The Eminem Show on stuff I could do without but like those first two records man with MM is that yeah the first two records I was all about Eminem and then totally lost him he was just gone a while kind of disappeared for a little bit.

His last album was Recovery; his singles on that \u2013 \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Rihanna and \"Bad Meets Evil\" this other album he did, um, the song with Bruno Mars \u2013 those are the most popular things he's ever done. Like \"My Name Is,\" real some shady nothing compared to those. So he's making more money than he ever has; he's more successful than he's ever been just not as impactful so to speak.
