Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, we talk it out. I throw it out; you have a great time. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to us on YouTube, and make sure you share it with your friends. Friends Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is spoilers: when are they okay? Is it ever okay? Personally, I think spoilers for anything should be off-limits from ChewieJDS. Spoilers for should be off. Get **** Che guess what Darth Vader; he's the guy's father. What happened to Jesus when he carried that cross up to Calvary? I don't want to know. Okay, I mean, he makes the spoilers are some something we all live with, that new testament, that's that New Testament.",

Okay, I mean, he makes spoilers are some something we all live with, that New Testament, that's the New Testament. I'm almost done, I think it's going to have a happy ending. Uh, you know, obviously it's big right now for TV, it's obviously big for movies, big for games every form of media right now because especially with the instantaneousness of Twitter. Right, right? You finish a Breaking Bad episode, you want to tell everybody how great Breaking Bad was, you can't, you don't want to ruin it for people, but some people don't assign to that situation. What are the Colin Moriarty rules for spoilers? The cut-off is like a couple of years, I think, is okay, okay. Um, so then what about us on a podcast, Beyond? We usually give games a few months, yeah, I mean, yeah, a few months is fine, but I mean this is like that's an Enthusiast crowd right, that plays the game, but I think in general, like the the",

But I think in general, like the most famous spoiler in my opinion of the last 20 years was Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense. Right? Sure, I see dead people knowing knowing that about Bruce Willis before going into that film would ruin the movie. Right? So that was like and that was when M was hot. Oh yeah, he was was hot on the street, what a twist. And um, about so like, so that that is like the cut off for me. Like and I think about that specific spoiler sure, like Darth Vader is you know being Luke's father is you know from Empire is a huge a huge spoiler as well. And The Usual Suspects was another one. Yeah yeah, um, and of course, The New Testament. Of course, that's how it goes. Bruce Willis, Vader, The Usual Suspects, The New Testament. Right exactly. Um, people get really bent out of shape about spoilers and I always got bent out of shape.\"",

That's not a spoiler, but I know there's an end credit sequence that's supposed to be really good, but I don't want to know what it is. I don't... you know, what I mean? I'm saving it for myself. The end credit sequence shows Wolverine and Storm. Oh God, here we go! In an earlier scene, before they became X-Men, when Storm was a meteorologist in Memphis. Okay, wow! That's a she did eat a lot of barbecue. Yeah, well, everyone in Memphis eats a lot of bar... that's a good point. That's a good point. Um, but if I never get around to seeing it in theaters and it leaves theaters, then I think we can start to get into this gray area of like... no, I don't.

Okay, that makes a little bit of sense. But and see I think that's out of line. You can't do it immediately. No, that's ****. You shouldn't be tweeting spoilers generally. And like, here's a funny thing for you, Greg. I read a lot of history right? I know you do. And there are times where I'm like, 'What happened at this battle in World War II in the Pacific?' Right? Like I don't know what the casualty rate in this battle was off the top of my head and I want to read more about it. And I start to go to Wikipedia and and I'm like, no, I don't want to spoil it for myself. I'm going to read a book about it and get to the very end.\"",

Was when before The Last of Us came out for like a couple months, they put out their multiplayer, they put out their teaser, the demo, and then the Dem Portillo, then the demo had uh cutscene titles in it and everybody thought they figured it out so then people started going into common threads and announcing what they thought it was. And it was the best because none of the spoilers were real that was the best part like when we started to play the game I'm like all these spoilers are fake, like you totally misunderstood everything that this game was telling you. And see that's the problem with spoilers is that yesterday I got a tweet from a kid and it was \"I have it from a psychic\" in quotes that uh Glenn or Maggie won't be long for The Walking Dead this season. I tweeted like why would you, why I'm going out of my way not to share that kind of stuff, I don't read The Walking Dead.",

Hopefully those are what made you want to play. I agree with you.
