            "text": "\"What's up everybody, it's me Greg Miller. Welcome to the second episode of Game Over Greggy. Yes, we made it to episode two. If you've missed it, this is the new vlog series I do every Wednesday and Friday on YouTube.com/gameovergreggy. I put up a vlog asking no questions, answering one of the questions you asked. It's only episode two; I'll figure this out, I'll get this intro any better. This is as good as the intro is ever going to get - you have to deal with it. Eden writes in and says: 'Have you run into health problems with Dachshunds? Would you recommend getting a Doxie even though they have a tendency to have problems with their backs/knees?' She's using proper pluralization for articles, she's using pronouns and such journals well, Eeden, you're asking a mouthful. So let's begin with what is and forever will be Portillo the Wiener Dog's origin story. All right, so this is Portillo - he's my Wiener dog; he's about this long, he's about this uh I guess wide in the face if you look at him.\"",

He's about this uh I guess wide in the face if you look get him right there. Don't start barking, Portillo. So would I recommend getting a Weiner dog? Of course I'd recommend getting a Weiner dog. Portillo here, he's the best $300 I ever spent and I didn't even spend it. So let's go back to a place called Missouri, the Show-Me State, some call it. I was living in Columbia had a girlfriend at the time we were pretty sure we're going to get married, we did, didn't last, and anyways this girl she decides okay she wants to get a dog but she's like doing that thing where she's like I want to get a dog and I'm like I don't want a dog. I was raised with cats, I'm a cat person, dogs are gross, you got to walk them all the time they poop, you got to pick up their own poop, they don't know how to pee, they're going to pee in the house. She's like you'll potty train the dog it won't",

He wants to be around you; always wants to sit in my lap while I take care of these dumb videos. Hence why he's a big YouTube star because you folks know. But now Eden's question: Have I run into health problems with Portillo? The answer is yes. Uh, number one, Portillo is prone to seizures; he's epileptic. You know what I mean? He's not on medication; it doesn't happen that often, but every so often he gets so excited usually when other people are visiting or when he's gone when we go out of town and we leave him with somebody. He gets so excited he forgets to eat or drink; so all his levels drop. He comes home and he has these grandma seizures that go for like 20 minutes. They're terrifying; he shakes vehemently, then he pees, and then he throws up. It's terrible. But like I can't you can't fault the breed for that; that's just Pell.",

I'm developing quite the file here of content I need to get through and it feels like a long video, I don't know how I'll edit down, so I don't want to go too long. You know Portillo, I kind of feel like Portillo deserves his own video right, so I hope you all have a fantastic weekend.
