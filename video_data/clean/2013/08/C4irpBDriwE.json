Today's topic of conversation is what if the British won the Revolutionary War, submitted by FPSShark. What if the British won the Revolutionary War? Yeah, well I mean so he wants you to put on your alternate history cap here. Of course, everyone knows the British lost the Revolutionary War in roughly 1776. No, they didn't lose in 1776.",

Of course, everyone knows the British lost the Revolutionary War in roughly 1776. No, I'm sorry, the British didn't lose in 1776; when they lost, they signed the Treaty of Paris in '83, but they actually lost in 1781 at Yorktown. Okay, but they signed this treaty in '81, so that doesn't happen. None of that happens. The British win; they should have won. The colonies were underprepared; they could've won. I mean, that's the thing \u2013 they could've won. Why... um, all right, so we're really going to get into the weeds here on this one. That's fine; that's what people tune in for. I don't care what my producers say. Where do I even begin? So, I guess let's stick to it. Just what if the British won? Yeah, but they couldn't have won unless certain things happened, like... so we could say yeah, what if the British won? Then they would've had colonies in the new world. I mean, isn't",

A lot of that stuff went to be manufactured such as lumber. So that all began in earnest in the 1760s, and by the 1770s things really came to a head where like people\u2014that's where taxation with representation came from. But really, the war was going to happen anyway; they were looking for reason to fight. And a lot of this comes from the fact that a lot of the people in the colonies were people who had already escaped European prosecution or persecution\u2014whether it's um in the form of",

Now, the reason that the Revolution began in 1775 was that there was an argument; it was normal colonists getting up in the Redcoats' face - the Redcoats were backing off, but then one person shot, and then they all started firing at each other. The British retreated; they were getting like it's so it's kind of cool to envision it right, like that they're running away like farmers taking shots at them from the woods and stuff like that - like it just got on now you know, and they've been waiting for this for a",

Like it's on now you know, and they've been waiting for this for a long time, like especially in Massachusetts, yeah. Um, so you know, fast forward to 1783, the war is over but we got to that point because the British looked at the Revolution as a Civil War, and a lot of people don't know about it or think about it or know that the English look at the American Revolution as a civil war; we look at it as a political violent revolution. And a lot of people such as Edmund Burke, who is a famous 18th-century English political philosopher and member of Parliament in England, didn't want to fight, and they didn't think that we should be fighting our own countrymen; we should just let them go.

Um, and uh, you know, so things of this nature like it's just it's almost impossible to imagine the British having won. I mean, like, what would have been the point? The British would have wanted and that would have been the end of that, you know, like, but I mean, like, what would it be like? I don't know, I can't picture the country is so we're just another Canada, or like New York still, with skyscrapers and stuff.

Um, then we are ready to fight in columns, and, uh, and, you know, that's what happens in Yorktown; Yorktown, of course, is in the Patriot too. When I think, I'm pretty sure Mel Gibson does something with an American flag pole, and that, and that, I don't know if that ever happened; that's based on fact. Also, there's a mall in Illinois called Yorktown. So thank you, FPS Shark, that was a good conversation; it was kind of a rambling conversation, but well, what you mean is you nailed it; I mean, you answered the question I wanted to know: would New York still have skyscrapers? Probably yes; all right, that's good enough by me. Would they be all like cobblestone?",
