So my question to you is, what was your first encounter with wings that made you love them oh so very much? You're making me think back... When was what was the exper I mean like the thing is it all evolved at the same time. I think the experience right was college. The seed was planted back in high school, of course. I was growing up in the suburbs of Chicago, where I was originally from, and uh me and my friends, you know, you're in high school at least when I was growing up here in the late 90s, early 2000s. All That Jazz... Uh, you didn't go out that much for like, \"Hey, let's go out to dinner tonight\" with your friends right? Spend all day with them at school or whatever projects you're having then you go home, you eat with your parents, and you try to convince them to take you out or something. Eventually my mom took me out to Lone Star Steakhouse where",
