If you like that, like this video, subscribe to my channel, and share it with your friends, please. Uh, today we're reviewing Oreo Mega Stuf Oreos - they're limited edition, apparently, marked with the Cookie Cream Super Bowl ad campaign. I'm sure you all saw that with The Whispers and stuff. I've always preferred the cream part of an Oreo; that's crazy - the cookie is the best part. Cream cookie, cream, and I'll tell you right now: you, Oreo Oration, the fan base is small but it is vocal, it is incredibly vocal, and all the tweets I got about Mega Stuf Oreos - thank you very much. That's the kind I love; there's just like in case of a new Oreo break glass Greg.",

Getting an old Triple Stuf, a three-way there it is, make a stuff. Let's jump right to taste. I mean, it's a she of cream in my mouth right now, it's good though. Mhm, okay, I'm right, sign off on it being very good. Um, the the cream much more pronounced than just a regular Double Stuf Oreo. Um, but as I'm always talking about in this show, you got the cookie textures there, it's all there. So you're getting the normal Oreo cookie snappiness, you're getting the normal Oreo cookie taste, but then the cream just just washes over you. It's there's a lot of cream going on here, it's like the end of Ghostbusters but in my mouth, remember 'cause of marshmallow. Okay, it's good, it's good, I like it. Definitely a different taste for an Oreo, but it is delicious. Let's see how it pairs with milk. One two three, it's sloppy, sloppy and creamy. Yeah, yeah, I can see kicking back with these on a tough day at the office.",

This is a whole new ball game. This is all cream and then just a hint of chocolate, which might not work for some cookies. I, I know I've I've I've knocked some cookies here on the show for similar things, but it works here. The cream is very pronounced, but not super sweet like when we get into some of those flavored creams you know, like we've worked with before. That's when it gets to be a little bit okay. This is this is way too much, but here it's that classic cream and it's creamier than I think the normal Oreo cream you get even in a Double Stuf that's the way the cookie crumbles for Mega Stuf Oreos, but what do you think? Leave a video response below. Just grab your iPhone, film yourself talking about him eat one, do all the do all the steps, do some twisting, do some milk. Let me know if I if I'm wrong or if I'm right on the track uh",
