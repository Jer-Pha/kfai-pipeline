I get the same questions every time we come up on Oreo Oration, though, so I wanted to tackle some of those. Tackle some of this thank you, of course, though I wanted to thank the good people over at Nabisco, uh back in December they sent me a care package including this cookie jar cup, uh plate, a whole bunch of other cookies and a bunch of goodies. I wanted to thank them so much for their support in that one instance because question number one on the Oreo FAQ is submitted by Bill Nolan: \"Are you sponsored by Oreo?\" No, everybody, a lot of a lot of questions about this, I guess understandably so. I do this all in my free time, uh I buy the cookies and I make the video for you then I put it up, uh Oreo does not sponsor me. I'm not an Oreo hater if they want me real quick. Oreo's watching: \"Do you want me to sell out?\" Done? You want me to if you want to pay me to review your Oreos, I'm hands down but no money is exchanged hands here.",

It's there's so many steps I want to make sure I get it all for you. Plus, I like a show that's polished right; I want it to be similar experience with the different cookie being the star of it right? You understand what you're going to get there's a joke in the front about what what you've been doing while Oreo is working on it. There's all this other jazz that's it basically.
