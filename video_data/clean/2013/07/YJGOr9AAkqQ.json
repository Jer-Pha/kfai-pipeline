A whole bunch of internet things you probably see me, but a lot of people know me for being the biggest chicken wing enthusiast. They know uh I lead Team Bone very proudly, but here's the thing: a lot of people think I eat chicken wings in a weird way; they say, \"You know, eat chicken wings and get your hands all dirty.\" I can show you how to eat a chicken wing really quickly - at least these little guys right? The part that you would think are not the chicken wing or are the chicken wing... however you want to do it. Now, that one's actually broken at the top, so we're going to do it. But what you want to do is get a real good grasp right there at the bottom - right now here it is. So I'm trying to show you in slow motion how it would go: you grab down there, you get both pieces of bones in your hand and you go like that - just down to the bones, like a cat in a cartoon eating fish. You know? That's it.",

You know, I no that's it, so good. Sorry now then you got other stuff there where you're pitching, you do the double pull, just got two bones, that's all it is, that's all the chicken wing is. So in regular motion, it would look like this. A lot of people they would probably leave that meat there but not Greg Miller. Greg Miller knows one day chickens are going to be extinct so I better love what I'm up to now. So there you go, it's how Greg Miller eats chicken wings. How do you eat chicken wings? Let me know in the comments below. Leave a video response. Watch all the crap I put on the Internet. Thanks. You gotta get into this is when you don't want to go touch touching your eyeballs, your butthole, you don't want to get sick, you don't want to get your butthole sick with some chicken juice.",
