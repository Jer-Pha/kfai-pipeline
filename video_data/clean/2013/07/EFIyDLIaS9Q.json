Get out of our business.\" What's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at them, and we talk it out for your amusement. Colin doesn't know what I'm about to say. If you like that, like the video, share it with your friends, subscribe to us on YouTube. Colin, are you ready? Today's topic is gun control, submitted by Matt McDonald. I think it ties in well with the NRA from at least Ma. McDonald, talk to me a little bit about this. This has been a hot button issue in the community, even outside of any of this politics stuff. I don't even watch the news that much anymore because it's so depressing and everything else you can't get away from it. A lot of shootings are going on; a lot of...",

Bring me up to speed on how you feel about gun control. Uh, depends - I mean what we're really specifically saying in terms of an assault rifle ban or anything like that, which was very popular and in vogue and obviously enacted uh in the '90s. I'm against that. Um, I think there's such a thing as reasonable gun control. Uh, there are people who would um interpret the Second Amendment to mean any sort of yeah uh to to to mean anything you could have a nuclear bomb if you wanted to.

We have all these other things that start popping up - more shootings, more school shootings, stuff like you know The Dark Knight. Um, where does that all fall into this? Like, you know I mean. Then there's this cry; you're going to have to bring me up to speed. I remember there was one that you kept saying that the lawmakers had a chance to like do this Olive Branch right, real recently - yeah, background checks. Right so um yeah, the background check thing that the Republicans kind of passed on in the Senate and the House never even voted on it; it would have created a system in which a federal system in which people had to get background-checked for mental illness or",

That to me is parental responsibility, right? This comes back to something we always have to talk about when we talk about video games, right - that you just want to blame this source but in reality there's a parent who wasn't watching what was happening. Yeah, exactly. I mean it's it's it's sad. You know, a vast majority of gun deaths are gang-related in this country and they're done by pistols. So if you can have a pistol and you can arm yourself with a pistol which everyone concedes then what is the point of having this gun legislation if it's not going to mitigate the problem of violence?

See that's why everyone sees an opportunity; it's all opportunistic, and frankly, the NRA is opportunistic too. That's what I was about to bring up. Then yeah, the NRA - Matt McDonald you know put them in as a topic. They are do you how do you see the NRA? Are they similar? Do you think that we talk about republicanism right and how you're this kind of Republican but there's all these other Republicans out there making a bad name for it? Is it similar to there, in this sense, that I think the NRA like serves an interesting purpose in the sense that they do protect gun owners' rights from a lot of people who like I said talk about the Second Amendment have no idea what they're talking about.

I will give the NRA credit that they do know why the Second Amendment exists and they're not afraid to talk about it, um, that it's an it's it's not even when James Madison and John Jay all these guys were at the Constitutional Convention, they were thinking about an addition to the Constitution in the form of the Bill of Rights; they were like, \"You know what we need to make sure you can have your flintlock and your musket so you can protect your family from robbers or anything like that, or uh, you can go hunting.\"",

Okay, so let's boil it down to finalize this whole argument because this is one of those ones where I don't think anybody has it right. I don't think there is a solution yet. You know what I mean? Bad guys are always going to get bad guns, right? Like, shouldn't good guys have the opportunity to have guns? I want a gun, poor yeah, I mean that's what the NRA says and it's true - like the only way you stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.

He didn't stop him from doing what he was going to do; those people are going to exist. What we need to stress in this country is a notion of personal responsibility in this case Adam Lanza's mom is responsible, just as responsible as he is for what happened. She's the one who taught him how to shoot, showed them where the guns were, and all those kinds of things; she bought those guns legally. If she had a background check, she still would have gotten them, and all those guns were legal anyway. You know, like you know the gang shootings in Chicago or New York or LA are much more",

So I'm just saying that there's a lot of dishonesty there, and what it really boils down to me is that people don't understand the Second Amendment and why it exists. And I'm not going to sit here and say that we have to have cause for armed rebellion or whatever; it's not about that. It's about saying like, hey man, this is our tradition: we own guns, you have no right to tell us what we do with our guns, get out of our business.
