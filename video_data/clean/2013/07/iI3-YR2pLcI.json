What's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation with Colin. I'm Greg, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at Colin, and we talk about it for your enjoyment. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to the channel, share it with your friends. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is what's wrong with Kickstarter from B_Switz41. That's a great question. You have been vocal about Kickstarter and many things. If you don't know Kickstarter, it's a crowdfunding platform where people put up projects - movies, video games, albums - people Kickstart them to get going. I'm I'm proud of myself.",

Yeah, I'm I'm proud of myself with this particular thing because there are a lot of people that are talking crap about Kickstarter, and your boy Colin was first. There's no doubt about that. So why you and I butt heads on this one time? Why don't you like Kickstarter? I think it takes advantage of people. Okay, why does it take advantage of people? Um, because it circumvents the way products usually get made and supply and demand. Yeah, well, not supply and demand necessarily - with uh, that is a good economic term to use here. No, it's I think it makes sense. But go, the idea behind Kickstarter right is my favorite TV show gets cancelled or this movie I wanted or this comic book I wanted never gets made. The creators go out and they say, \"Hey, nobody wants to fund this thing through the normal routes; we want the fans to do\"",

The creators go out and they say, \"Hey, nobody wants to fund this thing.\" The normal routes are we want the fans to do. Veronica Mars is a good example; they used Kickstarter. Did the Veronica Mars movie get kickstarted? They put up the total there's all these goals: please submit money to get this project made. I think that's a great idea, I think that's awesome. Yes, I personally would love to see a Conner (or Conell) Superboy comic book before New 52, but I won't get that for a long time. So if for some reason somebody could go out there and do that, I would gladly give them money to create it. So the market doesn't want my product; there's not a market for it right, and I can't get anyone to give me Venture Capital to make this product. I can't get anyone to invest at all in this product, so I'm going to go to the hapless people",

They're going to make this movie, it's already paid for ahead of time with people who are just going to see the movie for free or something like that. Yeah, yeah, they get to go and be on it. It depends on what tier backer you are, so like the money is given to them with no risk. There's no one looking over this money now; they give the movie and say that Veronica Mars' movie is really big, so the people who paid for it get to see it. But then, as said the box office, they put it out on Blu-ray or whatever and they make like $20 million in profit - they just keep that money, that's just theirs now. So basically you gave them an investment, like you gave them capital to see the movie in return, and then they just make all of this obscene amounts of money off of you. Yeah, there's no risk to them; it's not capitalist - that is not capitalism. Yeah, the thing we always come back to, and I understand when",
