He said that meant a lot and a lot to him, he wasn't he liked it this app's weird it's definitely working but it said no gaming headphones are the best thing you could have and the problem is I don't have those available so right now this is a different delay and I'm trying to talk a little bit softer CU When I hear my self then it's then it's easier to do so he's I'm kind of loud everybody always tells me tells me you're very loud Greg Miller so if if I can talk softly so I don't don't hear he it see it's much worse what I can't hear when you can't hear your voice that's when is when it really gets weird",

It's much worse when I can't hear my voice that's when it really gets weird and all it is is what I'm saying and playing back my own voice through a Volo has come through and making it very hard because you see it's just playing your own voice, it's just playing your own voice. When you can't focus on your voice and all you're hearing is your voice delayed coming back that's when it gets screwed up. So San Diego Comic-Con was a lot of fun. Thank you everybody supporting me live. Follow me on Twitter, it was great. I had a lot of people come up to me wanting photos and autographs, that was awesome. Thanks so much. But thank you at home for watching, it means a lot to me.",
