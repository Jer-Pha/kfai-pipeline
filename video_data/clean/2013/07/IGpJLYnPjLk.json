Um, and uh, if you got your hands on me, that's a different story because you're literally stronger than me so and you're big. I'd be done actually if you if you got your hands on me, but if I'm like we're UFC fighters, right? You're more of the boxer-brawler, I'm more of the wrestler. Yeah, like I think that if I got a few good swings on you, you wouldn't hit the ground for days, real bad. Yeah, see, and this is like whenever people want to argue about, like Batman versus whoever, there's always these caveats right? Like sure, if Superman fell from the sky and it was just like real life then Batman's dead, but I think at least give me a chance in this one. Oh yeah, you have a 100% chance of winning the fight, oh wow okay, I like those eyes, like maybe not 100%, maybe there's some way that",

I like those eyes, like maybe not 100%, maybe there's some way that I can get out of it, sure, sure, sure, but like you have a strength that would be violent if you got your hands on me because you're much bigger than I am, you'd be able to choke me or you know put me into submission with all this weight I've got. Throw it back at me, but if we were to start on even ground, you would have to rush me, I mean see this, see this is the thing that's going to be tough for you is that the running, yeah, no, yeah, the running, but you would have to come at me and that means that I'm going to have to take a few swings at you now. Whether or not you can kind of like you know not be phased by them, you know do some blocking, like sure, sure, sure, yeah, that's see if I'm blocking like that then yeah I'm good, yeah, like but if I get one or two in then",

If I don't if I grab you and try if if at any yeah I totally get you, I see if we're running what I'm gonna have to do is yeah I've got to somehow get you off guard, throw something at you and try to get you low in the in the torso region and get you down and hide my head around from the back of you right but yeah I understand what you're saying. If if again if you get if I'm running and you connect once in the head like yeah now now there's another there's there's an X Factor a wild card here, Portillo is the wild card it's that why don't if you threw a punch you know then see like now now this",

So um, just being around you're going to fight dirty, yeah probably, yeah me too I would be fighting dirty real bad, crotch. I'd be going for the eyes too. Remember, you know George Costanza, Jason Alexander himself once on The Tonight Show was talking about how he was taking some self-defense course and what he told Jay Leno was that yeah like eyes are like grapes and so you can jam your eyes in go to the side, their eyes would pop and they... I'm like that's that is what I will do in every fight from now on and I haven't had to use it yet but I'm ready. And if it had to be you well godamn it it has to be you well. I think I think the bigger they are, the harder they fall Greg. So all right that was a good topic no I mean no clear answer",
