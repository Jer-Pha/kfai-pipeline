Why do you **** care what somebody else does? Tax them, make money on their marriage license. Let's go. Yeah, that's the thing, it's um, it is totally these people think they're being very principal, they know they're going to lose like that's the thing, like that's what I've read into it and I know that because a lot of those people are are Republicans and I'm a Republican right now, um there are a big sect of especially libertarian leaning and and more moderate Republicans that are for gay marriage or if they're not for gay marriage they're totally for gay unions and stuff like that and",

And and a lot of people think that there's a nuance argument in a lot of conservative circles that people are against gay marriage because they're against the government being involved in marriage at all, and that they shouldn't be dictating who gets married to what, and that shouldn't be a state issue at all. I don't really care that much about it; the way I look at it is, if a gay person wants to marry another gay person, who gives a **** about that? You know, like who cares? Like I don't. I agree with you. How does this affect your life if you think that a gay person is going to go to hell for being gay? Then think that that's your prerogative, but you can't let that; you can't be so scared of the repercussions of your own religious beliefs.",

A lot of Democrats, by the way, were against it. And uh, you know, there's guys like Strom Thurmond who ended up having a long and fruitful career in the Senate; he was in the Senate forever. Yeah, Strom Thurmond filibustered the Civil Rights Act and had the longest filibuster in the history of the United States over one day. Um, and that was over the Civil Rights Act. And he was reelected like six more times after that. You know? So it depends on where you are and who your constituents are if you can get away with this kind of stuff. But when I see someone who I think is otherwise really intelligent, like Rick Santorum \u2013 I think Rick Santorum is a smart dude, right? \u2013 Rick Santorum sounds like a bigot when he talks about gay marriage and gay rights; he sounds like an idiot.

And like this sort of thing makes the Republican Party seem backwards, and that's what really frustrates me about it. I'm a Republican and I believe in gay marriage and I believe in gay rights. I don't think if a gay couple wants to adopt a child, what is the big deal? This child is just going to live in a foster home otherwise. At least he's going to have two dads or two moms that care about him. Like I don't see it as a problem and like the whole sanctity of marriage argument is ridiculous. It's already messed up. That's the thing, I'm 30 and I'm divorced already. Like it's not like oh what are you talking about? You know what I mean? Like it's not like gays are going to show up and really",

I bet you they get married; they get divorced half the time just like straight couples do. It just doesn't make any sense. It's just like every argument is pitted against the gay rights issue. Just sounds stupid and makes them look stupid. And we've got a huge seeing a huge problem with the Republican Party, specifically because um, for like I always argue that the truly conservative view is to support gay marriage. I really feel that the truly conservative view is to say like do what you want; that's the **** conservative view. You know? You live and let live.

Like that doesn't make sense, like that is that is just intellectually dishonest you know and not and not consistent with your other views. And I think consistency in politics is what's really important and sometimes it hurts you know yeah I think sometimes the Republican party as a whole should take into account that the consistency issue is what's going to win for them and I would like someone to come out and say I don't I'm not comfortable religiously with gay marriage uh I don't think that a man should",
