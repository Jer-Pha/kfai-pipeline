Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at them, and we talk it out for your amusement if you like that. Like the video, subscribe to our channel, and share it with your friends. Colin's ready today's topic of conversation is: Has making these YouTube shows made us closer? From @BABBY3009: Are we close because of these shows? Um, we're already really close, but I don't think so. I honestly don't think so. I mean, I think it has... yeah, yeah. I mean, like you know when would I ever find out how ticklish you are and hear that you know... I mean, like there's little things I think most of the time when we're talking we know where",

I think most of the time when we're talking, we know where the conversation's kind of going and how the other feels about something, but then we get to these things like where I don't think we've ever talked about, like religion, like we did in the Ghostbusters episode and stuff like that. We definitely get to have more I understand that yeah, I guess I see it from that like what you know about the person sure yeah um but yeah I always well we were unusually close to begin with so like you know I think that it's brought us into a different era of our friendship whereever now we have like basically a business like and like we buy shirts um and we yeah we we are pursuing something together that I think brings us closer also with our partners Tim Gettys and Nick what up boys um so why' you raise your hand, Nick no one you know no camera can see you excited so like the four of us",

So like the four of us, I think have been brought closer generally because of our endeavor to do this, yeah. Um, and then I think you and I have been um, yeah, brought closer in the sense that we've learned more about each other for sure. Um, what's interesting I think is that you know everybody knows we work at IGN together and for years we're on the PlayStation team together, but since I've moved over to be video and you do the PlayStation, we rarely talk at working. We used to have desks right next to each other; we'd talk all the time back and forth. But I'm never at my desk, you rarely are too \u2013 you're always running around doing something. So we actually don't talk anymore, and we come home, and then we you know I watch Nashville or play games, or you go do whatever the hell you do back there; you don't want to know.",

So I think I think I look forward to these things because we get to hang out and goof around. Yeah, I look forward to conversations with Colin because it's just it's fun, and I'm glad people enjoy the show, and the show is growing, so that's cool. Um, and I'm happy about that because you know we started this - the idea for the show came from you, it was your idea, and you know I had nothing to do with it, I didn't really care about this stuff until you were the one who was like 'I wanted you to do the show with me.' The idea for the show was like I'm crazy right? Like and I say funny things but the show seems to resonate most with people when it's more serious and thoughtful - and that was something I don't think we expected. Now there are examples of that not.\"",

Now there are examples of that not being true - The Star Wars episode is like one of the most popular ones we've done, and that was funnier. Girl Meets World is the most popular show we've done, and that one's funny, but I liked that yeah we've gotten to know each other better, we've gotten to talk about a lot of different kinds of things, but also it's gotten me heart with the people on the internet who follow us and like us, especially they really like you and follow you because they like the more intellectual conversations, they like the more serious stuff, and they get to know a little side of me that I don't think a lot of people know, like because the internet's all about tweets and bursts and information and labels and stuff like that it's like get this dog you talking I'm",

I feel like I don't like being put in a box, and this show lets me, sure, it gives us the pulpit to talk about something outside of games, and it lets me express, like, the views in a more eloquent way sometimes about uh, the way I feel about certain things, and that I'm not what you think, um. And so I like that aspect of the show. Um, I was like, what I find interesting is, you know, you're talking about the fact that our show hits with serious topics, I find it super cool that like, the shows that are like, the most... and I'm not talking about like, The Girl Meets World or like, where we\"",

Just put something in the comments; I don't care. It looks good to YouTube when we do that, and until then, like the video, share it with your friends, subscribe to us here, and until next Tuesday or Thursday have a conversational day.
