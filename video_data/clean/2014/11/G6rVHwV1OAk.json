Go ahead. How much you put in there? Uh, three-quarter ounce of uh coffee liqueur. Gotcha. Of course, the coffee keeps you awake; the Jameson puts you to sleep. It's the perfect mix of cocktails. Three-quarter ounce Irish whiskey. Here comes the star of the show, everybody. What are we using? Mint or mint Oreos? Right on in there. And it wouldn't be a boozy milkshake unless you have a little bit of ice cream in there. Oh, a little ice. What flavor are we going with? We're going to be doing a vanilla ice cream. Oh, Dryer's vanilla, of course! If you're east of the Mississippi, you eaties weird right? Why do they do that? They just take a big scoop of vanilla ice cream in there. Just one big scoop and maybe a little more. That's what I like. Here we can give it a little bit of... give it a splash of milk or if you want to be a fat ass, you can hit with some cream.",

Here we can give it a little bit of milk or if you want to be a fat ass, you can hit with some cream water, scoop of ice, give it a good blend for you. Oh yeah, to help accentuate the mintiness out of that, we're gonna pop a nice little mint sprig. What did you... what you beat the hell out of it for a second though? What was that all about? Oh, you gotta release all the aromatics by just uh giving it a little bit of slap, give it a quick slap. Get ready to have your mind blown. Take a sip. I'm I have a pretty high bar for Oreo stuff, so we'll see if it blows my mind. I love the aromatics and God damn, I don't yeah, I see like the joke is... of course I don't like sweet stuff all that much. Like when I'm drinking, rarely do I want a sweet this of course has the Oreo taste to it but it's a hint of Oreo and tastes a lot of the ice is coming through it's a cold drink I like that um it's not overpowering I could\"",

It's a cold drink; I like that. It's not overpowering. I could see me drinking this at the holiday party with Mom. She's over there under the mistletoe. The boss comes by, \"Get away from my mother!\" God damn, that's good! What's it called? It's called the Irish Polar Bear. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's the Irish Polar Bear. What do you think of it? Let us know in the comments. Then make sure you keep coming back here for future episodes of Follow the Liter with Greg Miller where he'll show you how to make all sorts of cool drinks. And if you want me to come up with a custom-made cocktail specifically for you, go to Patreon.com/KindaFunny. He's gonna name a cocktail after you; that's insane! Until next time, I'm gonna keep drinking this and probably end up taking off my shirt. Happy holidays! Cheers!",
