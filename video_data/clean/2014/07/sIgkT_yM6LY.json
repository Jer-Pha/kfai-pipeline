Looks like we got some kind of whale. Let's read about him. The first thing we have is Loopy's corduroy whale toy. Who's ready to man the ocean waters? This plush and cuddly whale will become fast friends with your pup. Hope they are ready for some squeaky long-lasting swims around the living room. Oh, of course. Every Bark Box has a theme. I should have read that first. This one is Surfs Up Pup. This looks like it's all going to be beach themed. Portillo is now over it. He's figured out that the whale is cool, but there is food to be had. Oh, Portillo, bro. Okay. Yeah. Okay, we'll put him back over there. Let's see what else. Another toy. We got a crab here, it looks like. Let's open him up, Py. This is a nice one. Oh, you got a toy box. Oh, look at that guy. Look how cute he is, oh yeah, the big crabs. Party's got",

Now, we're getting into the food stuff. Patell, of course, can't smell through the bags, so he's into different things. Oh, okay. Okay, let's start here. Right now, this is cool treats. All natural smoothies for dogs. Just freeze and eat. Says gluten-free, dairy-free, no sugar, blah blah blah. Pina colada flavored though. Do you like pina? Party doesn't even know what it is. He knows that it's something that came in his box. This is the Yeah, Mrs. Barksmith's Pina Colada Smoothie. Each tree is made from human grade food. Human grade food ingredients. So, human grade.

It looks pretty delicious. He seems to be into it as always. Of course, Portillo, of course, would probably eat a battery. Uh, it's three benefits in one treat.
