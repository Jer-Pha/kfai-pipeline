So you know people didn't like her right there. There's a lot of stories from Seth that she they were just like, directors would work with her and she would just constantly give them hell. Well, she had a huge show mod and she was like a huge star on that show. And I think I think Rue McClanahan was on that, that's her name right? Like the redhead that I think she was on that show with her. And I think that like she had like a big sitcom that she carried for a long time.
