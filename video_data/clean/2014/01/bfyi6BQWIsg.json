Yeah, I, I, I did something like that very briefly for like two months, uh, 1992 or '93, and I don't really remember it very well. Yeah, uh, I remember I hated it. Yeah, I didn't like the money and like that. I why was I here? Annoying counselors, annoying people, like annoying like 20-year-olds in charge. You're just like, \"Get out of my face.\" Um, but yeah, during summers, I would uh, you know, it was interesting. Like I don't remember my early my earliest summers, but after my parents got divorced, I was like seven, yeah, I separated or whatever. Uh, I used to you know, I moved to New England for a while to be with my mom, yeah, and um, I would spend summers on Long Island so from like late May to like late August, I would be on Long Island with my dad, and uh, so that's how I spent my",

And uh, so that's how I spent my summers. That was actually kind of normal for me because I was like, \"This is awesome. Like, I get to go back home. I still have my friends at home and then I have this new place that I live.\" And I moved back permanently in 1997 to Long Island. But um, so that's how I spent my summers. That's just you know, I'd swim in the pool we had, like an in-ground pool. I'd swim in the pool and be just off the leash, like nobody there watching. No, my dad was there, but I mean like, I lived on a court they called it, and there was like six houses and kind of surrounded by woods. And uh, you know, my best friend Tim and his brother Mike lived two houses down, so I would just hang out with them all the time. We'd play Street Fighter or roller hockey.",

Yeah, yeah, I... Summer represented you know in a very real way just freedom and like, and just you really just did whatever you wanted. It was it was awesome, you know? Like that, the show I often pine for my childhood because I didn't appreciate those things in the time.
