So, Greg, in 1861, the Civil War erupted right out of nowhere, slavery, yeah, everybody's mad about it upon the election of Abraham Lincoln, the second Republican to ever run for presidential office, uh, South Carolina seceded then a bunch of other states seceded before you knew it, you had another country in the South called the Confederacy and these two countries existed side by side for a while and you know for a few months until the South, uh, you know, uh, attacked a, uh, a Union Fort, what is it called?",

But if you extrapolate the numbers based on the population then and the population now, we would lose like 8 to 10 million people in a civil war today in the same way. You know, so um, so there were this whole unpopular thing. So Lincoln is really, you know, it's not only that he's a martyr for the cause because he was, but he's not a **** because of all the great things he did. The South needed to be Shermanized; Sherman was just Sherman, the ****, because he didn't do any other good stuff; he just went down there and what he just torched it; he tortured people.

But what Sherman did to the South's economy set them back generations and caused I think some of the problems that persisted in Reconstruction and afterwards because the South wasn't on economic parity with the North because of Sherman's complete destruction of everything until well after World War II. And maybe that wouldn't have happened, and maybe Reconstruction would have looked different, and the South would have looked at it a little bit differently, um, with a little bit more of a brotherly slant. And that we might not have gone through the Jim Crow era in quite as violent a way if Sherman didn't torch so much of the South in order to instill",

There's a lot of revisionist history specifically about what he did and his March to the Sea. While I think he's a good man and was following orders, but like that whole technique, I think makes it one of the more unsavory parts of American History. Do you think this is still a reason that you think for, like, people walking around with their Confederate flags saying \"The South will rise again\" - is there still that chip on their shoulder? I mean they got set back generations because obviously their economy was destroyed, so like yeah, you would have a chip on your shoulder. You know, for these Northerners.

The problem with that is that they wanted to talk peace in which the Confederacy would still exist and so it seemed like the fight was inevitable and if that's true then Lincoln's course of action from 1861, 1862 well right up to April in 1865 was right but Sherman's what came to my mind for me immediately because you have to be intellectually honest right like we're on the Northern side right like we're Northerners, the winners we",

And you know there is a legitimate thing to be said that the South was fighting not only to protect slavery but protect states' rights and 10th Amendment rights, and that they really believed \u2013 even though slavery was at the core of their cause \u2013 that um they were fighting for independence, their own war of independence, that could be said. I don't agree with it; they needed to be squashed out and put down; they were wrong, but we didn't have to take it to that level, I don't think. And there were real repercussions for that, you know.
