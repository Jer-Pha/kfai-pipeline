Um, I was texting this schmuck over here and he wasn't responding right away. And this is... I wanted to talk about texting and the downside to it because I think we'll all agree that texting is the universal awesome form of communication. It's perfected. Are you with me on that? I am. Perfected, as far as not texting is concerned. But continue. No, no, no. This is this is how we go. Okay, now it's so... Here's here's here's the couple things about texting right there. There are two people in my life who and I just looked at one of them who continue to piss me off with text messages. One is my mother because she cannot she never proofreads anything and when the text comes through, it's incoherent garbage. It is incoherent garbage. And then when I don't respond correctly because I can't understand what the hell it says... And by the way, you can't",
