I actually made my girl watch Don Jon the other day, which was terrible. Uh, didn't you tweet that you've now revoked her privileges? She's no longer allowed to pick anything. Why was it terrible?

They have this show, 'Halt and Catch Fire,' whatever that looks like - it looks awesome, it looks pretty awesome. But um, the problem with Mad Men is they're forced to sort of drag these things out a little bit beyond where they should be. Right, like 'Mad Men' does seven or eight episodes, and then we have to wait an entire year for the second half of that season. But that's AMC's technique; man, they've been doing that with everything they have. Right, but also with Don Draper at this point, I'm like his character arc should have ended; we should have come to a resolution on that by the third season. It's too long.\"",

So like but let's assume they stopped there, that's still 72 episodes, 44 45 minute episodes as opposed to just a 90-minute or 100-minute movie I'm just saying in terms of caliber of storytelling.

I don't like these contained movies where it's just this 90-minute one-off thing, it takes all this time, they build it up forever, it's over before you know it, nothing to look forward to for two hours now.

Like I, I like vinyl, and you know have a lot of buddies that collect vinyl. I don't because I just it takes up so much room, but like you know to me I think it's a good thing because it will bring movie costs and prices down, and then you'll be able to rent things day and day. Because I agree with with Greg in the sense that there are certain movies that come out; Godzilla is actually a good example where I'm like I probably see that I saw that garbage Godzila movie in the theater in 1998, and please with me you know I love that song \"Pleasure\" no, so but you know there were movies where I would actually make you know I just hate go; I I'm like Greg I **** hate the movies you know.",
