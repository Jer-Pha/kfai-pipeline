We can go through this one quickly if you could have a job like we all have kind of our dream jobs, I would say or like we're able to do kind of cool things that don't require massive intellect right and that's just being honest right. Like to produce or you know to write about video games or you know um to ask or do any of these things like you have to be good at those things requires talent but it doesn't require the genius level intellect right. Sure, thank God. If if we had if we had the ability to do anything we wanted to do and and have like a real academic skill like you were really good at science or math or something like that what would you do? Like what would your profession be? Would you be like you know I like for instance when I was younger I always knew I wanted to be an historian but I was always really fascinated with",

That's where my mind goes too. Right like I always think about that if when I should say if when the EMP goes off and it all goes to hell, I have nothing for society but if I were a farmer, a plumber, or a home carpenter would be good. Carpenter is really good. That's really high on my list right now. Like I was always thinking my boss is a Jewish carpenter, Jesus. That was the longest silence I think we've ever had on the show so many so much stuff ran through my brain in like a split second. I was like where's this gonna go?
