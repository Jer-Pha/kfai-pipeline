Then on YouTube, every Monday, we start the rollout of videos, topic by topic. Colin, yeah, what do you got for me today? What is the best sport? Football, American football, UFC? Well, our conversation is gonna be very repetitive. Colin, you guys are gonna say hockey right? Yeah, I think well Jim, why hockey? Give me give me the case for hockey. Hockey in my opinion is the best live sporting event you can go to. I agree with that. WWE's not real, I feel like hockey players are some of the most down-to-earth and most genuine uh sporty uh athletes uh you rarely find one that is kind of um you know obnoxious or you know um they're all very like because most of them are Canadian and they're all very just nice people and they don't kind of flaunt their.",

Yeah, absolutely, the hard huge what also is that? I love that players hand uh shake hands after playoff um rounds, that no other teams do that or no other sorry yeah I mean we'll stay on the topic of hockey since someone else is going to say it. Uh, I agree that hockey is the best sport there, there's other sports that I really love and rev I love football, love it, love it, not soccer - soccer is probably the worst sport but but hockey is why why is soccer the worst sport? I think we can all agree with that.

So Sakura has timekeeping problems and it was to me like it's just totally arbitrary when Ghana scored against the United States and had the lead they would just let the ball go out of bounds and they would walk as slowly as possible to the ball pick it up walk as slow as they can back to the line and then throw it back in. It's like, how is that allowed? Like the sport can just be manipulated. Track of the time when the ball's out of bounds, they add it on after. Yeah, but that's what I was getting to. Then they're just like, yeah, just play another three minutes. It's like, okay, how in the flying **** do you know that there was 3 minutes taken off when clearly there was much more than three minutes because it's like",

It can be manipulated easily. It's not like American football where manipulating it is part of the rules of the game, for instance running the ball, keeping it in bounds, throwing it - all that kind of stuff has to do with how you manage the clock. But in soccer, there is no clock management because it just doesn't stop. It's a hugely frustrating sport, plus there are a lot of floppers and **** like I love watching hockey; it has some divers as well, it's comical in soccer but I digress. I know a lot of people love it; Tim said hockey is the greatest synthesis of skill and physicality, it is a brutally violent sport but there's finesse, you cannot like the beauty of hockey.",

I you know goal tending is is tough, is hard to play, but I always give a lot of credit to you know defensemen able to just you know hit you know a center streaking through the neutral zone and he just hits him with that crisp pass. My girlfriend always makes fun of me because like in in The Mighty Ducks they always talk about soft hands right? But that's really the thing that you learn when you play hockey: having soft hands is that when they have the puck, here's the puck, because you don't you receive the puck, you don't just put your stick down and the puck will just hit your stick and knock off there's all these.",

The best sport is football, I think you're getting that action, you're getting my score, getting okay, yes, the Super Bowl was terrible too.
