My point is that I feel like the reason why Star Wars - wait, for ninjas to come back in vote is that it has you know notable characters. It's not like I don't think anyone can find attachment to zombies as a as a thing. I don't know, I think Star Wars just has that perfect set of themes and characters. Yeah, I hear that the thing is that people have been saying the zombie genre was going to die out for years and for so long vampires it's not going to die, it'll go down, it'll come back, it'll come back up but I don't think zombies are going to be up.

I think in my opinion, I don't, I think it's all opinion-based. We can't look into the future, but like I, I think The Walking Dead doesn't have more than a few years left of being relevant. I mean, in my opinion, I just think it's going to come and go. My thing is, what do you think? Is it being relevant? I think I think it like you're saying the TV show goes away and the games go away, but the comic keeps going. But then that's not relevant. I mean, comics are just war comics aren't relevant. Yes, it is when Star Wars movies ended. No, but see that's that's the difference if if The Walking Dead were to go away suddenly for 20 years, do you think people would still be insane about it? 20 years is the point of Ninja Turtles and Transformers.

But it's still relevant. It's my point is if Walking Dead were just suddenly like okay, we're done, I don't know that anyone would care about it beyond a year later. I think one thing why Star Wars does well is because parents who like to film pass it on to their children. I don't think Walking Dead is something they're going to pass on to really. I you don't think that like the next generation of kids will like zombies, um. I don't know.

That's but I think that's such that's franchise gold, that's what every movie studio or or IP developer dreams of, right? A franchise that no matter how long it's been under the public consciousness uh is still relevant. I think that if when The Walking Dead TV show ends it's going to just disappear. I just don't think I don't think there's anything that's going to that's going to stop that from happening. I don't think they're I don't know if they're going to do movies about it because they will already have done eight you know successful seasons of TV. Well, that's like saying why did they do the Batman movie they already had the Batman TV show that was that was like the 60s though and it wasn't very it was bad it was yeah it was different it wasn't bad that's what I'm saying about this is that",

There are all these different legs to how do the games sell? Like I know everyone loves them, but are they doing well? They do well enough; I mean Telltale seems pretty happy.

Like, they go to the CDC and they're like, \"Oh, there's lore.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, lore is really important if you want to have a story. You can't just tell a story about people forever in this environment.\" Cormac McCarthy did it with The Road - everyone always brings up The Road. The Road is 180 pages long; you know?

And Supernatural Capers will be the beginning of the end. See, I just feel like that's how the zombies start. I just feel like the franchise is going to fall into the same thing, where the TV show is going to end, it's going to get out of the public eye for a while and then something else zombie-related will pop up and that'll be the new jam, like with vampires - right, Twilight was huge and then it's gone. You know again, it was based on literature with an end, yeah, it wasn't based on something that has no end and can be taken in different ways.

The same thing happened with G.I. Joe when G.I. Joe was canceled in '94 and then G.I. Joe Extreme came but then they have like the new like anime style G.I. Joe and G.I.
