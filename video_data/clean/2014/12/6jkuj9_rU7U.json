Yeah, before you begin your topic, I want to let you know while you do this, we'll be thanking our Patreon subscribers here who supported us at the tier to support us and get their name on the screen. Thank you so much; thank you for your support. We appreciate it; we love you guys so much. Um, my, my uh, my topic is I you know briefly want to discuss with you guys Christmas presents specifically maybe the best and or worst presents you ever gotten like memorable presents that you received as a child or maybe as an adult. Sure um and uh you know some of the things that stand out to you so I'll tell you about a few of mine, and then you guys can tell me about some of yours. Um, a couple of them obviously are games; two games I remember specifically getting very well is The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. I remember getting that; we had our Super Nintendo already, and we got A Link to the Past, and I was like, \"I can't believe this.\"",

I remember getting that when we had our Super Nintendo already, and we got A Link to the Past, and I was like, \"I'm playing Zelda again,\" and it's back to more of the original Zelda roots, not Zelda 2. Um, so I remember that being very excited about that. Not quite freaking out with the N64 kid, but very excited about the other game I remember getting is Mega Man 3. And that was a really seminal moment in my life because I was a huge fan of Mega Man 2 to the point where my brother and I would rent it over and over again from a video store in our area. And uh, they eventually offered to sell it to us because they were like, \"Why do we keep renting this? You're the only ones who ever rent it.\"",

The one that stands out for me is Burger King when they had the Simpsons full-size dolls with plastic heads and then those soft bodies, and that was another thing we needed that whole set. And like me and my parents drove around forever to McDonald's. Remember they had the Batman and Robin cups? Yeah, like every kid in the 90s had that cup. Power Ranger movies were the same thing; they had the cups. The Star Wars back in my days was like the thing - the Star Wars glasses and ET glasses. Oh, glasses! Christmas present Lincoln talking glass rocks River Raid on the Atari - that's awesome. Rabbit Hole there. Christmas gifts to stand out for me would be when I got a WWF Royal Rumble on Sega Genesis.
