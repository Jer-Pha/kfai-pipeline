He loves film. One of those he thinks is an exception to the rule. This gets me excited because I've been trying to make a point literally for years, probably four or five years, to get back onto the movie train. Can't do it, though. We try; I try, and I just can't do it. But I feel like you know because I really used to go to movies all the time - like I was really from when I was a child through college, I would go to the movies all the time.

Like remember when we said... you know, you thought that like things like Tower Records or Sam Goody would always be there? Nope. I never remember saying that those people were stupid; I would have thought that right back in the '90s. Going to be anything like that. This is like when theater movies came around - they thought they're going to put theaters out of business, or whatever. Like when TV came around, it's going to put radio out of business.

But I can't help but wonder if the movie studios must embrace what the music industry had to with iTunes - which was, \"this is going to happen\" and we can either get in on it now and make our money, or just shrink and don't accept it. You know? Because I mean, I think that's what's happening even if we could compromise on a level of TV shows, right?
