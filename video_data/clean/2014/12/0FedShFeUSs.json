It just looks like they're hiding your keys. Yeah, it's like they're hiding one sock. Nothing, and then they like... I don't know when they walk and stuff and everything they do with their hands. I don't know, it makes me laugh. They're like small people in raccoon costumes. That's what that's what trips me out about small animals. I think that I do. I think I could take a small animal. Yes, do I think I would? No, I would freak out. It would you die? I don't know, that I die... I just I think I would lose.

Yeah, then it's on you, and you're hitting your own leg, so you're causing yourself damage too. No, that's yeah, that's how I imagine that happening to Greg because I can Envision Greg fighting this raccoon right, just running at Portilla, Greg just first things kicks it, but yeah, he runs up his leg and stuff, and then all of a sudden it's like Shadow the Colossus, like taking down the boss, like bit by bit cutting through your spine with its razor-sharp talons.
