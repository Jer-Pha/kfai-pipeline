I told you, you know it's like playing the game, but it's a cop-out. What that is, yeah, if Lex Luthor's doing all this terrible stuff, just kill him, okay? Thank you. Now, why doesn't President Obama just go kill every dictator in the world, because that's not - that's the exact same thing. President Obama is bound by law; America is a superpower, America could do whatever it wants, it could start a war with the whole planet if it wanted.
