She was so desperate to be on the show as a Lifeline that literally anyone who applied could just put her down and she would accept it, and one time they called her \"Phone a Friend\" - good for her! Final answer, yeah... well, I mean remember you could use the computer, so she had the \"Rosie effect.\" I love it. By the way, 99 - when that show took off in summer '99, yeah, I was obsessed with Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. They loved it then they syndicated and ruined it.

One was counting down to when the guy would lose his virginity and one was counting down to when the guy would die. And they came out hot, and they screwed him up, and they passed him off so that one guy thought he was about to lose his virginity, the other guy thought he was going to live for 99 years. But then it turned out they figured out at the last second - one, the one guy who was about to lose his virginity was actually about to blow up and die or whatever. And so they fixed it; they blew up was he a suicide bomber? No, no, there was like \"blow up\" in Intercourse. I know, like imagine that. Well, no, no, no, no.
