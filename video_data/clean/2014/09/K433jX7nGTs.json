I see who's sitting to the left, I see who's sitting behind, who's the other diagonal? Oh it's this guy that's my competition. We're both doing this and we both looked at each other and I could tell he looked at me. He's like \"that's my competition\" and that is a true story. And we competed and then I don't really know... You started the Chump Busters Club? Yeah it's where you're busting Chumps, busting Chumps left and right, busting Chums makes them feel good.
