Instantly know that, and that is Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Large Marge, yeah. Oh wow, that's so funny because that's what I was thinking of too, man. That scared the **** out of me; it scared the **** to me. That was just like the scariest thing in the world. It's that and Lady in the Water, what the cat, the Siamese twin cats? Is that The One? We know that's though; we are Siamese. That's leading to... I thought that was 101 Dalmatians. I don't know these dumb movies. Oh my God, that traumatized me. I don't know why one Dalmatian has to be a foil for all the dogs. Isn't that cruel? DeVille, yeah, that's right; she probably is the cat somewhere. See the one I was you're... I like how we're jumping to different conclusions.

I don't remember anymore, I can't remember either but at the end of it he's stuck in somebody else's head watching their life through their eyes like he's just in their head for the rest of their life what a nightmare that would be to be conscious for like I mean Colin's head the rest of his life Jesus can't do anything I just got to watch whatever the... this kid is doing, terrible stuff, I do I sleep, do I just sit there for 8 hours in the dark yeah can I ever communicate any what I it's like a Dante's Inferno situation being stuck in Colin's",

One, it's funny Tim and I came to the same conclusion because that is exactly what I thought I was horrified by. She does the weird face, and today to this day it is like I had to look away when I saw that movie for the second, third, fourth time because I was so terrified. It came out of nowhere, and that's what you've got to love about that movie. Yeah, it was... that was like I used to rent that movie when I was a kid from the library, and my sister would be like, \"All right, don't look now,\" and it's like this is what's coming up now. It freaked me out too. Um, but the second observation is just that I wasn't going there with this because there's just... when you say something like this, like what parts of movies stick with you and like you don't forget, and I think about scary things, what I think about is Fire.",

I watched that movie so young, I love my parents, they're good people, they really do mean well, but they had zero concept of like what a child should watch and shouldn't watch. Like you know I saw movies like Predator and Aliens and RoboCop in the movie theater when I was like four or five, I don't even know how the hell I got in there, I just remember seeing it on the screen and Fire in the Sky was one of those things where I rented and I used to have a great relationship with my local video store.

And I get to the horrifying part where he wakes up in the weird latex bubble cocoon and cuts himself out floating. Tim doesn't know what to say. Let's explain what this movie is first. By the way, I saw this in the theater with my brother, and it was horrifying. So, so... I was like six or seven years old when it came out. Fire in the Sky is a movie about these dudes; it's based on a true story, apparently, about guys from Upstate New York who are abducted by aliens while driving on a country road. And it's about what the aliens do to them. So, like, it's an alien abduction movie, but it's not a joke. It's... up. It's totally messed up. It's a messed-up movie.

The Stand was the post-apocalyptic book he wrote about like the virus or whatever, and it's about like different people that survive it or whatever. It's a great book; oh, I should check that out. That's a fantastic book; it's long but it's good. No, it wasn't. Yeah, so The Stand was like a mini-series on TV. Okay, yeah, they did a lot of those, but it was one of those where I started watching it, and I was hooked, and then as it kept going, I was like, \"This is really terrifying.\" Like this is... And I'm sure I'm remembering it through like child's eyes 'cause I'm sure if I watch today, oh, Tim Curry is the clown that's the way I feel about some of the things I've seen.

Like I was like there were certain movies like when I go back and watch them now, like \"Labyrinth\" - the Puppeteer scared me. Was it called Labyrinth? There were those little toys and stuff that scared me because of the animation, like how they looked. It was like kind of clamation but kind of not, and like it was so jerky and like it looked freaking like that's how I imagine toys would move, yeah you know like they only have like three joints, yeah which just really jerky and weird and it was that was scary, that was the worst.

Um, when I first played, I think I was 11, and which was old for being scared by things like that, but its story these two little girls, I don't even remember exactly the details, but it's like two twin girls or something, and they have the camera, and like you take pictures of ghosts, and **** like you only see the ghost with the camera. And I remember playing it, and it was more of a situational thing where in my the house that I was living in at the time, um, the only place I could play games was in this back room that had a lot of sun in it, and so there was a lot of glare on the screen, and it was really hard to see, and it was me and my friend sitting there trying to like make out what the path through was supposed to be going.",
