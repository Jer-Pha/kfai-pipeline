I you've been gone for a while. I haven't hung out with you. I've taken to calling you \"The Scumbag\" Nick Scarp (the scumbag) because I've been gone for we because I went down to LA, no what happened is we put up a video last week about Goat Simulator and this struck a chord with our listeners and fans - they enjoyed the polarizing very polarizing issue on what you would do. Everyone enjoyed the hilarious conversation, I'm told. However, our friend Jenny Osterberg tweeted \"Oh my God, with all that's good and holy, Nick was the one who married us... you know what I mean?\" And at this point, I started telling people the story of how she didn't know you were a scumbag. Oh no, she knew. I'm a lovable scumbag, that's true. No, you're our scumbag. No, they straight up told me like before they",

And then at the very end, rounding it out, the Pure One Tim Gettys let Tim host. I'm a little upset right now. What's wrong? I forgot to put my shoes on, so now I feel naked. And you also forgot to get me a Mexican food. Did I? I'm just everything you know is wrong. But you remember to wear your sweet double jacket. Yes, it's really cold in here. And I like this jacket.

Just want to say something, you know, might be a little controversial before we get into the topics. I've been watching Breaking Bad; I'm in the third season. Uh, not as amazing as everyone makes it out to be. It's a good show, it's a good show, but I'm not like... blown away like everyone talks about it like they talk about The Wire or Sopranos. Or it's not even remotely as good as those. I think it was better than The Wire. Here's the thing: is everything builds on top of each other though? By the you know what I mean, like it's all one thing that like it gets faster and faster and I'm more out of control.
