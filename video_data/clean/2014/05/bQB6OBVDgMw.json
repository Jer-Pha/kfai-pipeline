It was the same oatmeal; it wasn't like you went back and got a different one. You were just having one bite of the oatmeal because you were hosting Daily. No, I saw that too when she was... it took her like no. It's just that I graze on oatmeal isn't something you graze on; that's why you're skinny, right? That is why she's skinny. Yes, that's why. I'm not a doctor; the rest of us see I graze but I graze on everything on the table all at once. Said that like a '50s guy. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a doctor. Over, not a doctor.

But he's also doing something right, he's doing right, no, I mean you got to know if you want to be skinny and fit, you gotta make sacrifices. I guess it's worth bringing up before we go any deeper into my topic of drinking that Colin tweeted right before this and I'm asking all day how to lose your gut, right? And so that's where a lot of this workout stuff comes in. See, this is the problem - so I have a problem, what's the problem? The problem is you think you're fat, if you think you're fat, you're not fat. I'm fat, I am **fat**, you are crazy if you don't think I'm fat, you're not fat, represent.

Harris that Greg provided me for uh and it's not out yet, it comes out really soon, it's called Console Wars: Sega vs. Nintendo - The Battle for the Generation Um is a good it's it's a great book, it's about 500 pages long, the text is kind of big though so you can probably fit it on 300 if they were looking at",

Fortune is a... that's those if I kept those today, those would each be worth like $100, so that's pretty good, pretty good investment. They were like 10 bucks each, um, so you know. But to me, like Genesis was always like the second-rate compared to Super Nintendo, and like I felt like I felt like Super Nintendo was like such a dominant console; it's such an amazing console, and it was really close between them. Super Nintendo ended up beating Genesis ultimately, but um, Genesis outpaced Super Nintendo for a long time.
