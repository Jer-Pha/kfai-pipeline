            "text": "Tim, what's your topic? My topic this week was just talking about Taco Bell. Mhm, T-Bell back on the fast food we've talked about what our favorite fast food places are right, but what are your favorite fast food Burgers specifically? That's a really tough one. So you go to McDonald's; there's the Big Mac, which is the number one so if I can only have one burger from a fast food restaurant for the rest of my life. Are you implying that your favorite burger is from McDonald's? Let him get to it, don't spoil, don't go out and spoil everything. I think that's just plain old-fashioned wrong. Your God, so I am addicted to the Whopper; I don't know why. Oh my God, are you telling me your favorite burger is McDonald's? That's they taste like sawdust; there's nothing in them; they don't taste good at all. The chicken McNuggets on the other hand are the bomb; like the little tiny kids' hamburgers, the bomb not because of the meat itself but because you get the fake cheese, ketchup, SL, uh, uh pickle mustard no it's a pickle.",

No, it's pickle and the mustard onion onions - those are the things that are gross, but they're not the best. That's not what I'm talking about; I'm talking about the number two, the two-cheeseburger meal, that's good. I don't know if it's number two, first of all let's clarify one thing right now. I didn't realize there were these types of people - I don't order off of the numbered menu when I go to McDonald's; I leave money on the table. I know why wouldn't you? He's a dollar man; I'm flush with cash right now, okay. When I go to Taco Bell, they try to scam me on that too; they're like, \"Would you like a number two?\" Is that sounds like a number two? Do you want another two? You want to add a taco? I'm like, no, I don't want another two; I want what I want. Okay, I want you to rob extra money from me for no reason. I just want a nacho.",

Their onion rings are good there when you get an accidental onion ring in your fries, I do every time, and I'm convinced they put the damn thing in there just as a \"hey, thanks for coming\" maybe next time. I used to love my old all-time favorite, probably the burger I've eaten most in my entire life was the Double Western Bacon Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr., the Double 'A' Junior Double Bacon Western Chees... that thing has like 1,500 calories; it's disgusting \u2013 it's made with onion rings in it.

You you are all so wrong, and I will debate you on this, and I'll tell you in a second. But their new burgers - this is the first time McDonald's has gone crazy. McDonald's never announces new food that's the thing with them. That McDonald's right now, all the other all the other chains have like new stuff all the time. McDonald's hasn't done that until like the last two years where they're actually doing different stuff. Um, they now have new Burgers - their first burgers ever to have Big Mac sauce besides the Big Mac. And like they're good.

You can order you can just ask for Mc sauce and I'll just give it to you so you can order double cheeseburgers and just put Big Mac sauce on it. I didn't know that, I thought it was like Thousand Island dressing. My problem with the Big Mac is this: when I was a kid I was like I'm going to try it, I got to try this Big Mac. I was like I guess I could hit that point in my life from my mom was like whatever it's too late let him just do whatever he wants to do so I'm like I want the Big Mac it's two patties three buns right you got the middle bun it's a little except superfluous it does is it is unnecessary",

Yeah, I agree man, because the only drawback of the Whopper is that there's too much sauce on it, so it falls apart all the time every time. This is the problem, which is why you probably want to stick to the single Whopper; maybe the Double Whopper, getting the Triple Whopper is good if you're on team fat, but you might want to get prepared for a messy meal or maybe get a fork and a knife to finish it off. My mom was allergic to bread when I was growing up, and so she used to get the Whopper in a little like Styrofoam box and just eat it right with a fork and a knife. Gets a little more sloppy ironically when you're eating it with a bun; it's built to be a sandwich.
