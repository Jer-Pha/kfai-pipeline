I'm doing well, thanks. You're wearing that Mickey Mouse shirt, you love so much. I do like this Mickey Mouse shirt; you've worn it forever, it's like camouflage - that you got at Target because you can't really tell what's on it. It looks kind of cool, but it's really my right pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. Then the one and only Tim Gettys let him host! Let him host indeed! If you're new to the show, ladies and gentlemen, what it is that each and every week four best friends gather around this table - each bringing a random topic of discussion for your amusement.

Now this is unconstitutional because we don't um we don't believe in in torture right so like if you you know execution is not torture but they can't feel it so it has to be like instantaneous the lethal injection so this guy felt it he didn't die he was like in pain right oh Jesus. So the lethal and I honestly I don't feel that bad he's like a convicted murderer but but still that's against our principles in the Republic you know we don't we don't do that. So anyway this started a whole thing about quite the hollow at least if you read about politics uh with you know first of all the legality of these things but also caused such an issue that the European companies that we get um our chemicals from to do injections won't give them to us anymore because in Europe um they don't do the death penalty.",

Yes to me I don't know what this means and it's sounds like you stand there and a bunch of people shoot you. Yes that's a thing, yeah a very old school thing that you know is considered um something you don't do anymore. And basically what it what it is in more was made famous by the Tombstone Pizza commercials exactly. Exactly what do you want your tombstone? He had a little blindfold on go cheese and pepperoni and eat pizza. I say it was made popular by uh you can't do that on television right yeah no 100% I don't think I hadn't heard of it until then it was always there was a skit on this is a Nickelodeon show in the 80s where um there would be like a guy like about to get executed something then they like\"",

So anyway, the question is introduced by this story on Politico, which you should go read, it's very interesting. Uh, what mode of execution would you prefer if you were on death row and you were going to be executed? Um, not firing squad, cuz I think a firing squad would be terrifying. It would get that really epic moment, give you a cigarette, like what, there's not going to be an oh, I would, I'm going to have a cigarette no matter what if I'm about to die, I'm going to chain smoke, cuz at that point it's like who cares?

I want you to send as many cans of Bush's Baked Beans as you can to the show and Greg will actually, Greg's so passionate about Bush's Baked Beans that he'll actually eat them out of the can on the air.
