If you have topics for the show, make sure to follow me and tweet at me Nick Scarpino. Like I don't even know how to say this - gotu e i g- o t a k What will humans lose or gain in the next stages of our evolution? You think we're going to lose nipples, gain them? We're going to gain more like nipples, like Pella, like when they have those big nipples that just come down their body and they look like buttons on a freaking suit. Yeah, no, I think dudes are LED suits. No, think so. Mhm. Have they even started? Have dudes started being born without nips? How many dudes without nips do you know? Well, see now I'm excited to hear what your genius answer is, Greg. What if people started being borned without doing touche no ears? Oh all those people without ears we're going to lose all right good call good call good call yeah the nips the",

So, you know, a person that might not seem very smart could have the capacity to be smart, like you said, if the condition was better. Nature versus nurture? Sure, nature nurture... I think obviously that we're going to become much, much smarter; we're going to become probably physically weaker and our heads are going to get bigger, and all those kinds of things that old sci-fi writers thought, you know, aliens looked like basically because we're going to basically have lesser and lesser need to do things physically. So over thousands of years, our bodies are going to... Well, robots will have all the parts of our body going to get smaller; no, except for that part stay the same, right? Thank God damn it. Uh, but I think you know, I think that there's something to be said about evolution taking some a species that over thousands years is smart and doesn't need to do anything for itself.",

Right? Well, robots will do that. Think about something intensive like putting a machine together, working on an assembly line - robots will do that. Like, we really are going in that direction. So it makes you wonder over thousands of years or even hundreds of years how our bodies are going to respond to that new condition, and it means that our brain capacity must be bigger, yeah, to deal with these these new technologies. But we don't need muscles on that front. Yeah, I was going to agree with you because look, the amount of information that we have to process on a daily basis now has to be hundreds of times more than it was 100 years ago for the average human being.

So we are forcing our brains in order to succeed in these worlds and for our gene pools to live on and to flourish, we are forcing ourselves to have to think faster and better and evolve in that way. And I think that yeah, we're going to get smarter hopefully taller because that would be lovely for me, and yeah, if we can get robots to take my wife out every once in a while. None of the things you're talking about right now I can't do it now, no. It won't happen 20 years from now, well... Evolution dude, it's not part of the party. 201 evolution is oh you just one over so many Southern states we just got Texas yeah I see it's a new southern strategy.

So I wonder in the coming generations how our size will be if we do get bigger because we have a surplus of food and especially in the United States, like we're very fortunate in the sense that hopefully it doesn't backfire on us one day. We're very fortunate in the sense that we don't have a huge population compared to a lot of places in the world and plenty of room to grow our own food. We're actually pretty self-sustaining in terms of our food stuff, so we're always going to have access to food. So I'd be interested to see like how our kids and grandkids and their kids and so on become bigger or kind of stay the same because there really is a huge difference between going to an old house, especially on the East Coast. I don't know if you guys have been in old houses; I'm sure you have. Like they're they're like doorways are made for smaller people 200 years ago, like you.",

Oh, I know that was out the waters; it's going to be really awkward showers in like 200 years. What happened? It's going to be really awkward showers because they're going to have bigger brains; it's going to be thinking more. We all know we think a lot in the shower; we do, and they're bigger, and the shower head's going to be lower than them, and that's always really weird. I'm sure you know - I know about it.
