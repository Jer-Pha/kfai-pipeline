Each one of us hosts one. I want something else is happening bah bah bah when Nick Scarpino who closed out the day came offstage, I was on Reddit at the time and I clicked onto a video of some girl who it was that I want to say in The New York Times article maybe not but it was an interview with this woman who is on Vine and used to be a kindergarten teacher but then quit me in kindergarten teacher just to twerk on Vine and now makes like six figures or whatever. And knowing Nick Scarpino, way I did, I was like here's a woman you'd like to know. Bebo based on the fact that number one her story's fascinating but number two that she's shaking her booty, she's doing as they say, she was twerking. The twerk she was twerking. She wasn't twerking; she was laying down twerking. She was doing the laying toward",
