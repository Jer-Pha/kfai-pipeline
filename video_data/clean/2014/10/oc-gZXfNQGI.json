You see, you got the green, you got the brown there, you got the caramel, you got the Apple flavoring here. It'll be interesting to see we will do taste tests here on Oreo Oration. Spoiler alert for the next 15 seconds of your life where I'll take bites out of each side to see if they taste different but I'll go right down the middle on this guy, that's weird. One day I hold on it's it's not going to happen sorry it was close where it looked like that finally might be the one that got me not today. One day I'm going to go to Oreo, I'm going to go into Nabisco and I'm going to meet the goddamn Moon wizard they got working there that can make a cookie taste like different things. It tastes like it tastes like a caramel apple, it tastes like you can get the Apple flavoring out of it, it t I don't know how you do it, that tastes like an apple and now granted I've only read about",

I don't think I'd do it okay let's go to the twist test best two to three one two nailed it come on that one was already pre-twisted and we might have to eventually have a conversation, ladies and gentlemen, fans of the Oration: do we need the twist test anymore? I feel like when's the last time we had one that failed? It was like Season 1, that was 2 and a half years ago; they've perfected this technology. This seems like it's going to be too much but for in the interest of some science yeah don't do that that's too much tastes a lot like an apple still okay so taste test they taste like a goddamn Caramel Apple milk test I want to do it uh oh First Look was good I don't even know this own show how many episodes have this been done Nick 94, 94 H um and twist test they were fine at it is making my teeth ache just like if I ate a bunch of caramel apples like I I just did but I think",
