Let's define the terms here. I'm sucking up knowledge, but I'm keeping myself; I'm still me. I just get everything this person knew - yep, and I can look through their memories and stuff. Yeah, you know everything - all the little twisted Dark Secrets, everything they know about sex and life and eating, and what's a sandwich, what's not a sandwich? Okay, now I have to change my answer if it's not just information then I may have to change my answer - that's anything; it's knowledge. Knowledge is more than just you know... well when you said knowledge, yeah, I thought facts, information, but knowledge - one can be knowledgeable about any subject. Knowledge was their treasure, totally. They gave us a crystal skull - let me go Indy. This is what I want - that that movie ruined my mood for months. Why would you do that?",

And so to figure that out, he had to do something that no one had ever done before. And it was because of his immense knowledge that he was able to do that and now explain it. I would venture a guess that someone like that, even 200 years in the future, would be able to take the information and knowledge basis at their hands and be of great use, regardless of what time this guy's an extreme intellect. Right? So no matter what he would go and look by the time he was in high school, he would have figured out and learned everything that he needed to know about calculus, trigonometry, algebra, any any of the any of the maths, mhm, the mathematics, the romance language as they call it.

So yeah, I would want to pick someone with the peak that was really smart, just because they wouldn't have to worry about the semantics of not understanding contemporary science. But you're right, I mean like you know Isaac Newton is considered one of the great geniuses of all time. We were talking about philosophy and all that kind of stuff. I think Thomas Jefferson would be a really interesting dude too, but you know he or Benjamin Franklin - like dudes that were just gentleman scholars, gentleman scientists who did a lot of different things, like were interested in a lot of things.

Yeah, that's why I wanted to be an archaeologist when I was younger. Um, I just loved history and archaeology. Um, I went to Jamestown when I was a kid. There's a really embryonic American archaeology movement now that things are getting old enough. Yeah, and a lot of it has to do with like Native Americans and old settlements and stuff like that. I was like, \"That's cool,\" and I went to Jamestown. I got really inspired by it, but again, I was like, too much science. Because you have to take geology and stuff like that. The geology is fine; that's fun. All this is fun. I love it all. Rocks are boring. I think rocks are boring. I think the most boring part of science for me is geology.",

I loved like Earth Sciences, like, and I loved you know so botany and all those kinds of things. I really enjoy too, even though it's very biological. And I loved chemistry, and chemistry was probably the one I understood the best when I really got into physics. Like I took an astronomy class in college that I thought was astronomy, and ended up being it was but it was astrophysics, like 11 or something like that. It was taught by a dude, U, I think his name was Michael Swain, um, and he works at CERN in Europe in Switzerland, and he would and he would fly to Boston to teach a few classes, and then fly back every week.

Maybe you had a great DP, maybe you had great people around you, but also you had a vision that was way more mature than it ought to be for someone who's 23 years old, you know?

We're talking about Touch of Evil. You ever seen Touch of Evil? It's a film from Orson Welles. No, I don't think so. Here's my question for you - and this is going to sound like a joke, Greg Miller joke, but it's a Greg Miller series joke: Does it offend you as a filmmaker, someone who's super knowledgeable about the craft, that you're referencing Orson Welles, when most people don't number one know these films that you're talking about and number two only know",

Um, but they're not necessarily that popular. Like when it comes down to it, I've come to terms with the fact that Stanley Kubrick's going to have a little paragraph in the history books, whereas Steven Spielberg will probably have a whole chapter. Yeah, but like I don't know anyone who's actually knowledgeable about film who would say that Spielberg is more of an artist or was a better filmmaker than Kubrick, but that's just popularity you know, like yeah either for different audiences. So no, it doesn't really offend me and I'm fine with that. And plus, I like the fact that nobody has to kind of dive into that stuff to really know about it, you know. And I guess nowadays I can't really fault people for not knowing.",
