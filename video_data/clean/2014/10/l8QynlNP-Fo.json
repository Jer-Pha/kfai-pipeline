And obviously they're contemporaries of A Tribe Called Quest, Q-Tip, and Phife Dawg. You know, these are untouchable rap groups that will never be beaten as far as I'm concerned.

There's like very few bands like Young the Giant, like some random bands that are really doing good stuff today, and then there's a lot of rappers that are doing really good stuff. I think a more accessible way to make music you know exactly, and like, the guys that make beats, like Scott Storch, and all these guys, you know, great producers, um, are making awesome beats that rappers then cling on to and make into their own kind of thing. I was I was listening to \"Problems\" a few days ago, which is an exceptional song if you like, and who does that musical song uh I don't know who does that beat; that's that's like a kind of a half remake of an old song it's not quite they borrowed a beat.",
