I want to know how you're feeling about it because you know I think on the barometer of PlayStation VR or VR in general Colin's the most positive. I'm behind him and then you were always the one who was like 'I don't know.' Yeah, and I mean here's my thing: is it a lot of fun? Absolutely, and like with all the games we get to play, it's super cool. I love being able to show my friends for the first time but it's kind of exactly what I thought it would be. Like, I don't know that I necessarily need to own this um, but again I'm very privileged in the fact that like so many of my friends have them I can borrow it whenever I want um, but the experiences are cool.

They remind me of um arcade games that the premium arcade games back in the day where you'd pay a dollar to be able to like it punch with the punch things or like Episode One Racer, you're in the car and all that stuff. L is very much like that - you're just kind of sitting and using Rock. There's a very infamous video I put on Instagram of me wearing a Team Fat shirt on a bean bag, tilting my head, and it's cool. Um, so then, yeah... like we're... I was talking about London Heist is my favorite thing, but I actually The Best for Last, yes, well, yes, because it is the best.

Let's call it the massive effect killer. No, okay. I have no idea what it is; I was just throwing that out there. That uh, let's let's go a little bit into it because the tutorial is a little slow.

I don't know if I was getting sick with every game, but this one seems like it's a mind-bender. Yeah, there's a lot of inception stuff going on. So it's like when you make the jumps mid-jump, you have two jumps. So while you're making your way to one jump, you can look at a different target and then jump over there. Gotcha! This reminds me a lot of the Flood in Halo. See these little dudes; they're jumping around, trying to mess my day up. Trying to start going to let them do that though. I'm jumping around all nimbly-bimby like nimble-Bim. Yeah, it is kind of disorienting but it's fun, you know?
