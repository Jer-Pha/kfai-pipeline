Because does winning the debate mean getting people that weren't going to vote for you to vote for you or does it just mean beating your opponent? If it's beating your opponent, I think Hillary absolutely destroyed Trump. I don't even think there's a question of who won and it's not even so much about her winning as much as it's he lost in terms of debating. Uh questions were asked, she answered them, he didn't; he just went in circles and said a lot of words that didn't really get anywhere, and um I think that in terms of tact she came off as professional, he came off as blubbering and um spiteful, and I think that she was absolutely prepared, seemed like he wasn't prepared at all.",

Yeah, and like talking about how much of a liar she is and this and that, and it's just like, \"I'm sorry,\" but when you look at it like the lying conversation is irrelevant when the person arguing it is literally just saying things that aren't true, and all their argument is is wrong, wrong, wrong over and over.

Like I think that's the most fascinating thing you can say about Donald Trump is that he's gotten this far by deciding not to play the, you know, the modern-day politics game. He's completely done his own thing and in the way that modern politics perhaps like it always has been has been there's been an element of it being just a popularity contest like this one especially is that's how he managed to push his way past every other Republican candidate.

He doesn't seem to have the perspective of what it even means, or if he does, he's intentionally just trying to make himself look like he's powerful enough to just make it work and like it when you contrast that with somebody who's worked within the government for as long as Hillary Clinton has, who's very pragmatic about these types of things.

Well, there's a big educational shift there, I think. That uh, everybody that grew up using Napster and all these other things when it got to that that jump-off point where those things were all but dead because if there's not people uploading things, there's nothing to download. So once it made that shift to The Pirate Bay, which was probably around 2005, I would say is when it like really started to half-life 2 came in four and that was huge - that was like the TorrenTorr exactly.

So they haven't... they haven't found it seems like Apple and iTunes with Amazon and Google Play and all that kind of stuff have the perfect marketplace to kind of nullify any um, like, negativity or whatever about things. Or whatever. I think Spotify is too easy and too cheap, so that's what gets people in, and then Pandora is fighting the good fight, too. I think Pandora is great for discovery. I haven't... I don't use it anymore, but um, it was a great discovery tool; that's how I found a lot of bands, you know. In my more recent years.
