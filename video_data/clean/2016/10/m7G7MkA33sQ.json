Downloaded my save we went back at it because you remember when Po was out here visiting for the Weezer concert we were balls deep as Colin would say in Overcooked and having a great time we were getting really good at it and then he left and I'm not going to play alone I didn't want to cheat on him with somebody else I kept the save in pristine shape went to Chicago downloaded.\"",

Once I get those, which my boy Colin Moriarty has agreed to help me with, once I get those, I get the gold trophy 100% Overcooked trophies. Damn, that's what that's how you do it. I'm excited now. Colin, how confident are you in getting these three stars with me? I'm not confident at all because you \u2013 you've been held down by someone we'll call Aaron; she's been an anchor on you in terms of how hard how high you could fly and Overcooked, cuz the game brings out visceral anger, and I can imagine.

So it's like our ecosystem didn't really exist in the way we know it now until really the PS2 started getting going; they had Japan Studio and all these kinds of things and people making games, but that wasn't really the the the onus on PS1 as it was on N64 so to me N64 was a secondary console that I had sitting alongside my PS1 myself, and when something came along that I wanted to play, I played it on N64 but most",

The SNES was like the leadup to the PlayStation 1, which was just every week, man - there was something coming out. Even if it was so amazing for someone like me who loved those games. Um, Quest 64 I remember in the summer of '97 or '98, something like that. Uh, we were anticipating this game, which ended up being garbage because it was just a role-playing game. We're like, \"Oh, we're going to get a playing game on the console.\" And then um, really what I remember about it is summers at my friend Cory's house, who's still a buddy of mine today, uh, on Long Island. He uh played Mario Kart and Mario Party and all these kinds of things and went in the pool or um, you know uh, we didn't really play wrestling games or anything like that. We weren't really into that but um, and then The Zeldas I think are really the touchstones - Ocarina of Time in '98 and then and then Majora's",
