Um, so as always the final topic is a bunch of your questions, you can go to kindafunny.com/gamescast-topic just like all my boys over here did. Loga Boga says who's been the best video game villain in the 2010s? My choice would be the Wild Hunt from Witcher Three or The Elusive Man in the Mass Effect series. Um, I mean I I mean I jump and we just mentioned it so maybe that's why but David from Last of Us he was a great villain he was a great foil he was creepy as all hell you know what I mean he was he was a different kind of villain too in the way that he wasn't like some bulky boss he was this wiry little creepy dude you know what I mean he had this creepy thing going on and then when he reveals that like he knows who you got he's like oh yeah.",

No, that's a good call. Yeah, I mean I would need to see my trophies to see what I've even played in the last five years that I would...I would consider uh yeah the Last is a good choice. I think a lot of the Uncharted villains are pretty cool, um Lazarevic maybe except for Laar, I like I like Marlo a lot. Got to drink this blue sap. Yeah, I don't know it's a good question. It's Kefka from Final Fantasy VI, yes it is, yes it is. I mean let's think about it like what what have been kind of the the franchises of the the last decade or so like you say 2010 but like let's even give it like the 2000s in there too but I mean franchises I mean that's the problem is so many games have",

I mean, I think I think he's kind of asking about talking about Mass Effect so oh yeah, I guess the Elusive Man's from Mass Effect 2 was in 2009 no, 2010 right and then Mass Effect 3 is 2012 so maybe it was 200, 2009 I don't know whatever.

Let alone how great he had been before, including Origins in underrated game. Mhm, very cool. Let us know in the comments cuz I'm sure you guys are like screaming at the computers right now or how the hell you... The Ghost Woman from Tomb Raider. Um, Anita Bath says hey guys I don't know about you but I really miss the creativity that the old Rare brought to Nintendo and video games in general, their ability to create new IPs reinvent IPs and to get the gameplay just right for the most part is greatly missed by me.

Although they had a few, a couple on Wii U, I think that people liked Toad, to a massive degree, and then a lesser degree some people liked like you know Captain Toad and all these other kinds of games. So I think that they exist there, but I think that you know it reminds me more of the 3DS where a lot of the novel IPs on 3DS are coming from third party. So um I think that the relationship has to kind of go like that. But I I agree with you, I think Nintendo misses Rare, and I think Rare has never been the same since they were acquired by Microsoft.

Parker B says, \"Hey guys, instead of some long crap, just want to say you guys are dope and what you do is awesome.\" I watched some multiplayer footage from the Call of Duty XP event, and honestly, it looks like Black Ops 3 DLC with a new color scheme. Damn, I think Call of Duty should take it back a few notches, like Battlefield one. What do you guys think? What's your opinion on where they're taking things? What would you like to see them do?

Cho Keller says what's up guys, long time, first time. In recent years, there's been an anti-pre-order movement spurred on by a portion of the market and gaming personalities. I see the points to both sides of the controversy. First, I can understand publishers getting sight of their early sales numbers and then putting less effort into developing a quality product. On the other side, pre-ordering - hard pre-ordering, hard-to-get items like the Wii U Game & Wario - can make for a much easier purchasing process for individuals.

The argument against pre-orders is that you're showing them that you don't care about quality and you'll accept whatever they give you, that's the thing right? You're buying this sight unseen, you are giving into this marketing thing, you are doing that and I pre-order games",

You are doing that, and I pre-order games, don't get me wrong. But it's that argument that is: you can't pre-order this game and then get it and then be mad like you had the option. Like when I am questionable about a game \u2013 that game looks interesting but I don't know if I want to buy it or I don't know if I want to play it ahead of time, and I'm not getting an early copy, which does happen; like I won't pre-order, I'll wait for reviews. Right? So you're for you to plop down your money and pre-order it's that you're buying into the marketing \u2013 that we all talk about how stupid it is, and we all talk about how stupid it is that pre-orders are here to get in line for Aloy's new game and Horizon; it's like, what the f?

That got drowned out by the marketing and then everybody was so mad about it. It's like well you had people telling you what they thought but you didn't listen to them, you listened to the trailers, you listened to the bombastic - to be fair on that, just they also weren't totally truthful and honest about the game. I understand so it's on them as well right? But yeah I agree with you, I think that like it it's it's endemic of a of a system of of um media and uh and kind of uh enthusiast press and publishers and developers where it's kind of like you want it to be taken more seriously but pre-orders don't allow you to take things seriously um in a way because you're not like literally",

So I think yeah buying into the marketing, buying into the hype is easy; we all do it. But when people say \"I'm very down and sour on games\" or \"for instance,\" like I don't seem to have fun with a lot of games or I don't enjoy you know XY and Z, it's like well I'm just being real with you. Like you can eat up in all the marketing hype you want; like I I play a lot of games, own personal experience yeah exactly I'm I'm I I don't eat up the marketing hype I I want to see like I'm excited about certain games but you know you still I was actually interested to play No Man Sky and I",

But what's even stopping you? And there could be something I'm sure that there's something maybe in the fine print but even if you want a pre-order a game so you have it and you get that discount for instance and you pay $47 whatever for the game instead of $60, what's stopping you from just keeping it sealed for a few days until you really get a consensus or get some information that you need from people you trust to make sure that's money well spent.

Yeah, the argument against pre-orders: You can't pre-order these games and then complain when they suck, and then complain that somebody stole your money. It's like, well, no. You had thousands of opinions out there and sites and YouTube channels that are not necessarily there to educate you but will and have opinions. You can find it and know that you're like Tim on this game and you're like Greg on that game. So, when you have those resources, you can't act like it was all the wool covered pulled over your eyes and this that and the other when you had the shot, you had the materials out there.
