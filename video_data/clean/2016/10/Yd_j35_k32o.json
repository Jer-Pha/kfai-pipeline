You're not giving enough merit to my Halloween costume idea. Here's what Nick does. I don't like it. Nick goes on vacation for a month and a half or something. Three years. Tim, the Pier 1 Imports guy, Tim Gettys. Hello. Back me up here. The entire time he's gone, he's bored clearly, so he's emailing us inane business things nonstop. I sent the man one question. Were you serious about throwing a Halloween party at Kinda Funny Studios? I need to know. I don't get a response until today, the day he's back. He sent 30 other emails before then.

Yeah, I want you to be. You know why? Because I read a lot of books on my vacation. It'll be my topic. But one of the books I read was Cary Elwes' depiction I guess the events that surrounded him doing The Princess Bride. It was actually a really amazing book.

Over there, the Pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. Go Islanders. And by the way, I need to say that I'm deficient on fiber, apparently. And I'm having some poop problems. So I just want everyone out there to know that. Past four weeks, I've been eating a low-carb diet, very low-carb diet. I had nothing but water to drink for almost four weeks. It's great. With the exception of two old-fashioneds. They have sugar. No Coke, no juice, nothing. That wasn't me",

That wasn't me throwing stones. I want the record to be clear. There's more carbs in the sip of beer you just drank than everything I've had to drink the last four weeks. That's the point I'm trying to make. Now, and I don't miss beer. I really do miss the Coca-Cola, though. But what I've been realizing is that all I eat is salad, like greens, sausages, beef. Six at a time, right? The sausages? Pepper turkey. Yeah, I eat five or six sausages at a time. I'll eat a pound of beef, but with a huge salad. You know those big green, big, big bins? I go through one of those every two days. I'm eating a lot of this stuff. But man, the last few days, my poops. This is the weird thing, because I have colitis, and I have some problems.

You jumped up on the Gears of War livestream last night. Had to run off to go poop. Yeah, I had to go twice. I had to go. Because I'm used to having very catastrophic stomach problems. I have my entire life. They really hurt, particularly colon problems. I guess convenient considering my name is Colin. But the weird thing about this is that the poops are formed, and they come out normally. But incredible pain when I'm pooping. Yes. Too dense? So what I was explaining to Greg was, it's not diarrhea, where if I pooped in Greg's hand, this is the analogy I use. If Greg held out his hand, I took a shit in it. Yeah, which I'd do for you if you needed me to. It wouldn't fall through necessarily. It would plop down and maybe stalactites. It sounds like a melting frozen yogurt.

Which usually is, it's like the coming of Gozer, right? We know that this is the key master. I understand that something's about to happen, and then sure enough, over there. Right. If you kept your hand like this solid, fingers together, the poop could sit in your hand, like a loaf. If you spread his fingers around, maybe it would be a little messy. So what I'm trying to say is that I need to figure out this dietary fiber situation, because I can't eat fruit. So that's out because of the carbs and fruit. There's no carbs and fruit. Yeah, there's a ton of carbs and fruit with the sugar. Carbs are bread, Colin. There's no carbs in a liquid. There's no carb in an orange. There's plenty",

I'm sure someone out there was curious about my poop. Now, are you eating enough fat, like oils and things like that? Oh, I feel like I'm eating too much.

I put that video up, and it went viral back in the day on Myspace and all that stuff.

It ends with him and her driving around on top of a car. That's a magic carpet. And then they get off, and they have a makeout sesh right there. What the fuck is your definition of asking someone out? Because that seems a few steps in. Yeah, it was definitely a few steps in. So the thing was we had done this before, where it's like pretty much back. If you grew up in the late 90s, early 2000s, there's that moment of we're talking, the talking stage, which I'm sure you're familiar with. Before it's like we're official.

So the thing was there would be months of this talking stage where there's a lot of aim going on, a lot of my space or whatever the hell, like conversations. Was there any heavy petting happening in this time? Yeah, there was some fun here and there. But anyways, the thing was there was a history set up where Curran had, we've made another video with him previously and a lot of my other friends just asking girls out and whatever.

So it was shot in a handheld cam with a bunch of car lights as the lighting. We shot it at night out in Sacramento. It's horrible, horrible planning with all of that. Anyways, the video was great.

And I've been on both Pirates of the Caribbean rides, I'll let you know. How'd that first one go? With and without, it didn't go well. That's a very short topic about it, all right?

It was me and Curren and Charlie's best friend, Jess. We sat at an Indian restaurant nearby and we're like, what are we doing? How are we going to make this all happen? And the problem was at Disneyland, if you make a scene. I just wanted to see if you're on the same wavelength as me is like, is the fact that it was an Indian restaurant needed in this story?

So, we were talking about the problem of doing it at Disneyland is it's hard to get equipment in and cameras and all that stuff. Yeah, you were telling me they don't allow that usually. Yeah, they don't allow large cameras, which what the fuck does that mean? They don't allow large tripods. And I'm like, there's just all these rules that I'm like, can I bring mics in? Like, I don't know how I'm gonna do all this stuff. Let alone, we're not based in LA. So, having to get everybody down there and like, who's gonna shoot it? Is Kevin gonna be there?

Because they have all these rules. I love that. That's such an ominous fucking thing, man. You might as well not even get married. Actually, it makes a better story, really. No, that's a fucking omen. That's an omen. You got banned from the happiest place on earth. I just like that. If Tim had gotten banned, he's like going in to do this thing that's so great and he wants to make it so awesome that he knows he's gonna die. It's like Solid Snake at the end of Metal Gear Solid 4.

Do you remember Metal Gear Solid 4? Yeah, that song wasn't in Metal Gear Solid 4. That's what I'm doing now. Yeah, no, because it turns out he stole a bunch of stuff from Russian people. Anyways, so we're going through this whole, all the shenanigans. Being a people who have gotten straight up booted from Disneyland.

So I was like, well we can't do that. Because that would just be the worst thing of all time. And I've seen videos of people getting ejected from the park during proposals. Because they come in and try doing all these flash mobs and these big extravagant things. And it's like, you can't do it because you're causing traffic problems and all this stuff. So I'm like, all right, how can I remedy all of this? So the idea I came up with was to have her watch a video that we pre-edited, put headphones on her. So she kind of gets this full audio visual experience. And it's really intense to her, but it's not intense to the people around. So, Colin",

So we wrote a speech that kind of references both of those things and intertwines their whole eight year story and all that. But we knew what was important to her was having all of her friends and family there. But she never thought that she can get a proposal that has her friends and family and Disneyland. She always thought it was gonna be one or the other. Of course we're like, fuck that, we're making this happen.

And of course she was just like, hell yeah, sign me up. So I knew that they were gonna be going down for the anniversary, so I was like, oh, this weekend, can you give me like just an hour of your time? I'm just gonna go down, we'll shoot some quick stuff, we'll be good. So we go and we go and so I wanna give a shout out to David Blodgett who works over at Disneyland.

We kind of walked around with Shari just shooting a bunch of fake B-roll for a music video that doesn't exist and she was so into it and it was so funny cause she's just there like just like doing this. I wanna see that by the way. Yeah, it's awesome. I was like, please just stand there and look gangsta. Like what's that mean to you? She just goes, give me the one Kev. Pop, pop.

So I hand her my phone, put the headphones on her and that's when shit gets fucking real. So we have this edited video where it's Curran giving this whole speech talking about how he asked her out eight years ago and blah, blah, blah and how much he means to him and all this shit.

But it progressively got more and more intense. When it was just his friends coming out of the castle, she was just like, you could see it hit her heart. But when she turned around and all of her friends there, some of which now have babies and her friends holding a baby and all this shit, she just was dying.

So I was like, I'm going to London for the first time. I got this idea. I'm like, it would be awesome to see this play. It's the original cast. I've already read the book. It's a phenomenal play. It's not a book, excuse me, a play. And I really want to see how they do it. And if somebody is just joining us, you are a huge Harry Potter fan. I'm a huge Harry Potter fan.

To the other poutine place, La Banquise, right? La Banquise. She makes sure, this is the last thing I eat in Montreal with her. We get T-Rex, La T-Rex. It's called T-Rex because it's all the meats. The T-Rex. The T-Rex. Thank you very much for our English speaking audience. It's French fries. We go with the barbecue gravy. Now I thought this sounded gross. It turns out it's a different kind, a little bit more of a spice gravy. It's not barbecue sauce. That was my concern",

Pleasantly excessive. Exactly. And this is what I'm talking about in the way of La Banquiste and then Chez Claudette. They're both doing these crazy ass poutines. I wanna do classics, see where I'm at, get the feel of that. We do this just to see how crazy they get. It's crazy, Tim. It's salty, Tim. It's meat. There's hot dogs in it. It's insane.

But again, look at how cheap those prices are for trios of food. Two Pogos, now this broke up on Twitter, broke out on Twitter, I should say, between our audience, where our audience was talking to each other.

And that's what I'm asking you. Is it because there are bagels that are just bread with garlic on it. Yeah, Noah's in a Einstein. I can't believe these places have made a name for themselves. They're making that abomination. It's just bread. It's not a bagel. What? They'll put some lox and some cream cheese on it. It's another elimination to be perfectly honest with you. We don't have time for that. We don't have time for that right now. Bagels should be their own type of problem. I mean, I can go so far down the rabbit hole with bagels and what they mean to me. But we don't have that kind of time right now. So all I'm saying is I think Canada has some, the Canadians have some great delicacies, Quebec very well known for its food.

All I'm saying, Tim, is put this on your radar for a team fat city. I'm down. I want to try it all. I'm very interested in a lot of Montrealisms as I've come to learn them. Recently, me and Gia hung out with you guys and you showed us videos of the- Oh, the snowman thing. Yogi Bear. Oh, me and Boy, Illinois. You showed us some Illinois kid camps.

There's a woman Yogi that I wasn't even - her name is Cindy. Wasn't even aware that was a thing. Standing there as a bunch of little kids are doing crunches and I'm like, what the fuck is happening?

Devin Hanssen, thank you so much for coming by. Thank you so much. Did you have fun? Did this live up to it? We were gonna ask you at the end how it went. No, definitely. Okay. Absolutely. Like, no, it definitely didn't. Well, you also have to ask, it's contextual. Like, what is it living up to? Like, you could have a very low bar. That's true.

Part of the little string of topics that I had was euthanasia, we went over that. And what made me think about that was, I have a family dog that was not doing well, but I didn't realize how bad it was going. And I've been in San Francisco for the last week. My mom texted me about two days ago saying they had to put her down. It was just time. And I didn't know how bad it was. And it caught me off guard. So I'm a grown man walking down the streets of San Francisco and just start crying in the streets. It was a rough time. So I would like to dedicate this podcast to my dog, Lucy. That's nice. I'm sorry to say. Yeah, don't worry about that. We all understand that pain too",

Guaranteed. I've been letting my hair grow, my beard grow and everything for the past, I don't know how many months. You got a nice Daniel Bryan looking thing going. Oh, is that what it is? Yeah. Someone was asking me about it. I put a picture on Facebook being in San Francisco and I said, it's just my camouflage to fit in. Yes. San Francisco. No, I just seemed like a local. Nailed it.

We just give it to somebody else, he takes over all my accounts. We've secretly been priming my brother the entire time. He is the next Game Over Greg. It's Doctor Who. It's just like James Bond. All right, we ready to go? We're burning, this all would have been gold content. Oh good, put all this at the end then. This was all great stuff. Thank you very much Kev, good job.
