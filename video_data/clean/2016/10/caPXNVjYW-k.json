On each one, number one was very... I don't think by the numbers, but it was okay. This feels like a normal Batman game, this feels like a normal Batman story, and then the end there's like this revelation of like, \"Oh, is that really what it's going to be?\" or is it going to be a cliffhanger where we come back and they undo that immediately? They didn't undo it. Episode two continues to spread it out and get really interesting with the lore, really change it up to some stuff we haven't seen before in a Batman narrative. Then episode three continues on that and again ends in a very, very interesting spot. The twist ending here I didn't see coming... uh... and I'm... it's... it leaves me a lot.

Very cool, yeah. Uh, I got to do a let's play of Sonic Mania that's now also on youtube.com/games and uh my God that game it's everything I could ever want. I was talking to you about this on our uh drive over here but it reminds me a lot of Mega Man 9 and 10 in the way that they're just they seem to be nailing it like don't say that this this no in in in terms of like the what it did is for the franchise this is in Sonic 4 you like this isn't Sonic 4 Episode 2 this is it seems like it's made by people that really really really care about nailing um the aesthetic the feel the the level design",

I was familiar with the Civilization series C4 especially, I know some people's favorites but um that was a game I spent I I I don't think in the last five years I played a game more hour-wise than Civ 5 um I don't think it's even close, so I've played Civ 6 many many many times less uh in terms of you know fewer hours than than Civ 5 but um the game is familiar uh I like uh some of the additions that they've made uh specifically um creating wonders and other kind of things for your cities or if you're your Capital Cities",

Um, you're basically using a builder not only to get resources like one-time resources at a particular block but also to create a farm once you do that with the you know with the builder obviously then the builder then disappears. Um, so you have to continue to create Builders and stuff like that. So the map I'm playing on right now, I'm playing on a randomized obviously map. Uh, small map at normal difficulty. Uh, just to get my the hang of the game. Uh, I'm playing as some African tribe, I don't remember it was a randomized thing you can pick obviously all sorts of Leaders with different benefits and deficits and um, you know so far so good.

You know, um, should I go for animal husbandry or should I go for pottery? You know, you don't have to make these choices. These are the hard choices. One cool thing that I don't think was in Civ 5 is that so, you, you know, people familiar with Civilization learn your science and all sorts of things, and it takes time; it's all turn-based, so like, you can say, \"I want to learn how\" uh, \"I want to learn ship building,\" so it's going to take me 14 turns to learn ship building, which is in the game hundreds of years, and um, you basically are able to take those 14 turns but it will only",

So like the game will like you have this big schematic obviously as games do of like this science leads to three sciences, which leads to these nine sciences and so on for that you start like branching off and it'll tell you like it'll take 14 turns unless you do this or it'll take 10 turns or 30 turns unless you do this thing unless you kill three Barbarian hordes unless you create a trade route with a neighboring city or something like that. So I like that little thing too because then it makes you think a little more strategically about how you're investing in science because for instance I skipped shipbuilding and then actually went out of my way to build a city on the coast so that I",

I was so into the minutia of like create your government and you can only have you can be kind of religious or kind of autocratic, but you can't be both, you know, or like you can't you know like you be warfaring or you can be militaristic or you can do all sorts of things. Like when I started playing and then it's like the science things like how you draw from like masonry to building a spaceship, you know is really cool and I like the idea of like depending on how you research because it's all based on like real themes and real eras so like you can reach the",

And I loved that, so if you're into that sort of thing or you could be really late, you know, you could be you could be in like 1900 fighting on horseback, you know, like depending on how things go. So I like I like that particular thing, so if that kind of thing strikes you then it's a fine place I think to jump in but if not then I don't think you should play Civilization at all. I don't think that necessarily this is any different on a core way than than five was, at least to me. I'm sure the Civilization nerds out there see many more differences than I do, but I don't see that many differences.

The unfortunate thing for Civilization 6 is that there's plenty of other games I want to play right now, so I think it's going to be one of those games similar to Civilization 5 where I you know I don't even remember like I use Steam so seldom that I think I've downloaded Civilization and I think I bought it like three different times cuz I'm like I don't even remember my I don't even know what the **** email address is attached to, I have no idea, I'll just go make a new Steam account and buy the game again.
