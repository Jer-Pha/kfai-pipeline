Later, yeah, I think so. But I like I like you know I really love Dragon Quest.

I was like, \"Oh yeah.\" And then but they're kind of good curative items too, like uh you could use them all once to stack your HP, which you shouldn't do.

The game overall is like baby's first either Minecraft or Drag no no but the combat's not like you know what you're doing in this game is nothing like Dragon Quest I mean that the um you know Dragon Quest is turn-based entirely, you know um a lot of the ODS to like the way this the screen like kind of blacks out and blacks in with the little things around it and so that's how you enter in and out of battles and um it's like Final Fantasy X or something",

Xbox One has outsold PlayStation 4 in the United States, meaning July, August, and September were Xbox One dominant months, bolstered by the launch of Xbox One S. There's some conjecture that folks are waiting for PlayStation 4 Pro, hence PS4 sales issues, but that's highly unlikely for most consumers completely ignorant of its existence with the recent launch of PlayStation 4 Slim as well. Um, so congratulations to Microsoft really turning it around, but that's the first three months consecutive period in the states, the biggest market in the world for video games, where um it was out sold by its competitor, actually out sold by PlayStation. I don't think there's anything to worry about. I think a lot of people are saying like waiting for Pro, I think that that's not true. I think it's Slim is finally attractive, it's an affordable console; they have Gears, things are happening. Why wouldn't you want to get on board? Xbox One S, obviously really, really nice.",
