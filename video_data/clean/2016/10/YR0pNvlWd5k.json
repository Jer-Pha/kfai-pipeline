            "text": "greetings and salutations welcome back to Kinda Funny Games My name is Colin Moriarty this is Tim Gettys uh today we're going to show you the game Until Dawn: Rush of Blood on PlayStation VR it's worth noting that our friends at Sony provided us both our headsets and all of our games so we thank our friends at Sony for that uh now Until Dawn: Rush of Blood is kind of a spin-off or like in the same universe as the really fantastic PlayStation 4 exclusive Until Dawn which came out in the summer of 2015 uh it's basically like a teen horror film we all loved that game very much you were excited about this since you saw it at a preview event Tim and so we gave you uh full reign here to kind of show everyone the game so I'm very excited about I mean this game was what what kind of sold me on PSVR the most I've always been a big fan of like light gun shooters and uh specifically there's a game called Carnival back in the day that me and Kev used to play at Round Table and uh it was pretty much this",

But yeah, I mean I'm of a different mind where I'm like I don't quite understand why this is an Until Dawn game. But I think that generally speaking, I think horror um is a great fit for VR, for virtual reality, and I think that uh similar to what we Greg and I were talking about on our Batman: Arkham Asylum Let's Plays, which deal with Locomotion in a different way - locomotion was dealt with by pressing buttons around, and Batman has no Locomotion. In Job Simulator, um this game is Just on Rails, so that's the way they solve The Locomotion issue. And you can play the game we're playing it with uh move controllers, but you can play it with a DualShock controller. So I wanted to be known that I absolutely love this game, uh it's super fun, what you were talking about The Locomotion stuff like it totally solves it and like",

Oh my God, this is so awesome. So far, my experience with PSVR has been great in the sense that it reminds me of arcades a lot like the kind of gimmicky stuff where you'd have to pay a dollar to play the game instead of 25 cents. I think that's kind of a cool thing. Oh my God, this is so active. It also reminds me of those random like um 3D rides you would go on, like the dinosaur one, like uh I don't know the equ like where we did at this place called Pier 39 which is kind of like a touristy thing in San Francisco - that's the one with all the old arcade machines. No, that was near Ocean Beach, but uh you go and it's like it's like theater experiences and like the seats move and do all the crazy stuff, like it really reminds",

I wouldn't have run oh God here we go um yeah something oh uhoh here you go oh so again these roller coaster type areas are really believable when it's like really does oh just makes my head like hurt oh God all right we're going in the hotel, so as you guys will see at the end of the stage, the game does track you on God damn it, the game does track you on things like accuracy and all that kind of stuff, and you get graded at the end, so there is a lot of replay value with Until Dawn: Rush of Blood oh God no mannequin things oh and the crow Lady this is great **** get away what you doing wow these things take a ton of damage can you stop guys getting shot in the face like Point Blank oh you can leave you can leave you oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no there's a oh there's a gun to the left so the boxes there's vibrant colored boxes you find in",

This game is a lot to handle and I like it. Now it's all quiet, something terrible is going to happen probably or maybe not, I don't know, no, it's coming, I'm scared. The funny thing is if things get too scary and you can just close your eyes and then you're not there anymore. God, imagine waking up to that. Jesus Christ. Uh, there are collectibles in the game as well, these collectible kind of statues you shoot from each stage has a bunch. What's up bro, are you waggling the remote to or thead? Yeah okay cool, I didn't do that. It it's really cool, you guys moving y'all good, y'all homies, you look like a homie, sorry about that. Shoot you in the dick, okay y'all gone.

Yeah, I'm here, but I'm not; it just disappeared. Any time it would be funny if we just all left quietly and the lights off and drew the curtains, and then you woke up alone in the kitchen demo yesterday - still terrifying, I'm telling you. Horror is where it's at, I mean, you know more than anyone horror is where it's at. I think with this particular unit and things like Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, I think there's a lot of natural... The other thing too is like right now I'm playing without headphones on - that's when it's really scary because you can hear the movement; my God, you can hear the moving, my headphones.
