We're doing another Let's Play this time we're playing Ratchet & Clank (2016), the reboot on PlayStation 4, the movie tie-in that's part of a reboot of the game that's based on a movie that's based on a game. Parts of the original game are here and reimagined. Yeah, that's what we're playing. Okay, cool. We've seen this for years at this point. It feels like... yeah, it's been a long time. We're close to April 12th, right? April 12th is correct. That's the thing. I got my cheat sheet. The game is April 12th, the movie is April 29th. It says sounds perfect. They're getting it out there doing it... uh, this of course a preview, you know, test version of the game or whatever. This is where Sony said we had a start, so I played a whole bunch. You couldn't see it, I couldn't show you okay, but it's fun. It starts with Captain Qwark he's telling the story to somebody else and he...\"",

I'm always been more of a Mario 64 guy compared to Jak and Daxter guy, so I'm a little, I don't really like the whole exploration, I like more the linear platforming stuff like that, okay? So then I see this, this um Ratchet coming out, like all right, that might be a little more yeah, and this was made by the Insomniac guys, I like Spyro blah blah blah, right? Then I see this game at Blockbuster and I'm like you know what it was $40 games back then used to cost 50 but for some reason this was 40 just came out right, I'm like you know what I'm going to give it a shot, I just bought it, just bought it there, you know didn't know the reviews didn't know anything bring it home and I'm like oh my God this looks like a toy store back in the day, right now now look at them and",

The main difference being Ratchet always kind of went two steps too far, but that was a good thing - it's a compliment to me saying that. But two steps too far, I'm going to make E3 references that are referencing things that are happening right now; I'm going to make jokes about my... I'm going to make jokes about things that make those games, you know, that the writing is not good anymore. But at that time period with Vita, it was refreshing that The Narrative of the game was making jokes about stuff that God knows there's always that nightmare where there's one guy still alive and where is he?
