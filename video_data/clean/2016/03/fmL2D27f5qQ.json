So my question is, and I've always wondered this about you guys since we kind of got involved: Is the company on its way to being quite profitable and quite successful in the long term because like I I've asked myself in the past like how can you guys charge so little?

It's fascinating to me, that's an amazing question, and uh, yes, so I didn't understand right any of this before, before coming here and talking with our investors and talking with other founders and teams about how to build companies and what investors are looking for in companies. Um, investors don't invest in companies unless they think they're going to be multi-billion dollar companies, so um, the answer to your question is like yes, investors expect our investors expect Patreon to be a multi-billion dollar company, um, that's what they want, that's what we're all fighting for, um, the the weird thing and this is this is God I'll never be able",
