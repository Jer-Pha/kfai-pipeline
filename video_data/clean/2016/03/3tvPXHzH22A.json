Gamescast topic: go there, leave your topics, we'll read them just like I'm about to do right now for Mya Luke. I was wondering if you guys could weigh in on your thoughts on refunds for digital games. There seem to be people wanting refunds for Firewatch because of the length, and even people beating and enjoying the game and still trying to use Steam's refund policy to get their money back. Do you guys think there should be refunds for digital games, and if so, how do you think it should be implemented? No, no, you don't think there should be refunds period. For what I mean, since when have you bought a video game and been like, 'You know what, I'm bringing it back'? I mean, I use that all the time, but that's...I mean, that's just not how things work. I'm saying for like age with I think it should be that if the game's broken, because if a game's broken, you can take it back usually.\"",

Yeah, but the refund policy on Steam is a reflection of the shitty nature of that catalog of games on Steam. That there's no curation, like a lot of games are just totally broken and they do suck because no one is minding the shop over there. So like, which is why we talked about you know, is the idea I think we talked about PS I Love You actually, like is the idea that like, there's too many games on PSN. Like they can probably remove half of those games on PSN and be totally fine. Like, who's minding the shop? There's an objective kind of what games are good or bad. But depending on how you feel about them, there is an objective like does this game even really need to be on our store right now? And Steam doesn't have that kind of stuff, so they do need to get people a way out of buying these shitty garbage games that",

But you know again, like being honest and being like, you know I return games all the time in the PS1 era, like all the time. Because like, you you could I bought Saga Frontier, that game sucked, I brought it back. I bought Street Fighter Alpha 3, or rather Street Fighter Alpha vs. Capcom played that for a few days, brought that back. Bought Tactics Ogre, played that over a week, brought that back.

Like I don't like not like let me see these GTA V reviews and see if this game's good. Like got it, I'm getting that game. You know, like that's always kind of been my attitude about games is like when I purchase a game, I'm not like this game better be good. It's like I've done my homework; I know this is my type of game. So like this game might be good or bad in my spectrum of favorite games, but I'm not going to finish that and be like oh that was a totally bad decision. So like yeah there's a lot of weird games on Steam, but like if you don't know they're weird, I don't know what to tell you. Like if you've never heard of it, warning, warning.

And I was like, \"You probably would have sold just as much\" because GTA people know they're in. Let's go, yeah, that's definitely a good point.

But um, fight for... but there were about 82 million PS3s out there or so in the while now. So there are a lot of people who never played Uncharted.
