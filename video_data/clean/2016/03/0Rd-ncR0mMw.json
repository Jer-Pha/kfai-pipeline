But do you need the fire if it's daytime? Well, I'm going to need some food. Look, I'm super hungry right there, like on the bottom left, I'm starving really. Yeah, so I got to get some food. I can either eat some berries or I can kill some stuff and cook their meat or I can just eat raw meat but it's not that good for you probably not a good idea. And let's see fire, I still need some stones. Gosh man, takes so long to get stones. I like his fancy little flip he does with it, I like that.
