No, let's just throw them out there because I have a feeling it's going to be a lot of overlap and if there is overlap Colin had the idea that we should come up with more than five so we can I have 10 so there's no overlap. Okay, I got a hold person, we'll be fine. Uh, well the first one for me is The Division, I've been waiting for that game for a long time it looks great, a lot of people at work are anxious to play they're involved in the beta um I just I love the atmosphere it's basically like The Last of Us in a giant multiplayer setting so I think for me that that is the most intriguing multiplayer game uh outside of Rocket League that I've seen in a while I just like because there's there's that undertone of of",

But in New York, in this post-apocalyptic world, sure, of course I'm in for that and the third person, you know what I mean.

That's just it, I'll never understand that.

Exactly. What about you, Greg? Opening my list here now since I can't double up on anything, you've already tried more games.

And I don't think that's what Mass Effect was about. And I don't mean that as an insult; I just mean that we need it to be a role-playing game again. And I hope that they do that. So, I'm super interested to see how it's been incubating for a long time. I think the game's going to be very vast, I think it's going to be very grand. Um, super excited about it. Just hope it hits this year, but I just don't know if it's really going to or not. First Mass Effect is still my favorite one; it was the CE, it was a traditional BioWare RPG when it came out.

So I think that's always going to be one of the things that I go into all horror games just knowing like well they're probably going to have some moment in the game where I'm ruined by the fact that whatever direction they went isn't the way that I would go, but uh I love the fact that I can still be caught up in a particular moment and that that moment what that the memory of that moment overshadows.",

And I think that even though games weren't around in the 30s, which is, you know, in the 20s when this is really kind of based or like this art style is based, it does seem congruent with a hard game. I don't think Cuphead can be anything but brutally hard, that's why I like it. I like games that are hard. I like boss fights, you know?

They're carrying over their pretty strong exclusive lineup from winter and fall into now, so as an Xbox one owner... not everyone uh that I in my social circle has Xbox Ones; most most everyone's PS4 player. Um, it's it's just nice, nice to see and nice to have a nice change of pace. No, I'm stoked to turn on; I'm really interested to see how the whole TV show thing plays out, you know what I mean with this like these videos in between gameplay segments of like what it's all... I can't wait. Yeah, I'm interested in the the weird backlash that happened, I guess it's not weird, I mean understandable, but the backlash that happened with Quantum with uh with it being announced as a day and date PC game as well. I'm I'm actually happy to see that because games seem to be stranded and I don't mean this with any disrespect, but it's like a few games have been stranded on Xbox One and that was really a shame for those games um like Titanfall and Tomb.\"",
