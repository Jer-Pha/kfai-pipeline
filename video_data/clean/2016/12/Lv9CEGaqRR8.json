Sorry ukulele has a release I know I know yeah we we did it on con click on the Wikipedia page scroll scroll scroll April 11th April 11th 2017 all right cool cool cool that makes a lot of sense I'm excited about that one too yeah me too it looks really good damn it now I need to reload this my my baby don't mess around because so uh Arrow is coming to PC PS4 and Xbox One q1 2017 don't know what that is Everspace coming to PC and Xbox One the Fall part two Unbound coming to PlayStation 4 do you know what that is no I was just ****ing around Outlast 2 yes coming red barrels uh I",

I just remember what a struggle it was to get the last South Park game out, and granted part of that was the whole Trey Parker thing, but it was also very much Matt and Trey and how much control they had over that and how much they wanted it and what they wanted it to be, and I don't think that's gone away here. And that's why when they originally announced that release date of December this year, I was like holy **** that's totally not what I would have expected awesome. Then it got delayed, and so again, I, and I think that's a game they have enough expectations on that they could put it as a fall game and clean up there. So you think fall, not even like June or July, I know, I could see, I mean that's what I said earlier in the thing, I could see it being the end of summer or into Fall okay okay Shards of Darkness coming to PC PS4 Xbox One Siberia 3 oh man PC Mac PS4.",

I think that they needed to tie in more of what made Mass Effect one great for a lot of real fans, like me. And they seem to have done that. And I think the biggest thing is that they feel like they have to tie in a story that has more meaning and more weight and more agency considering the response to the way Mass Effect 3 went. And I don't disagree with those particular responses specifically with Mass Effect 3's ending, but I think a lot of stuff's on their shoulders with this game. I think that they have to realize that they have to deliver. They realized that people were not happy with Mass Effect 3. They realized that there are things that need to make it more role-playing like. And people have bigger expectations. Worlds are getting bigger, games are getting bigger, and and I",

Worlds are getting bigger, games are getting bigger, and I think that's crushing that game. Like I, I, I think there's something wrong with it. And I thought that that was an interesting response from Aaron Higgs - you know who's someone I know, but not like that well to put that out in the open is interesting. So, so I think it doesn't carry tone right because it could be \"Oh man, I'd buy you a beer.\" I mean, it doesn't necessarily say \"I'll buy you a beer.\" It's been a nightmare over here. I don't know. I mean, yeah, you can't read that's the way I read into it. I mean, but you are usually an idiot, so you're projecting your own emotions onto it - that's true. Blackwood: Crossing is coming to PC, PS4, and Xbox One early 2017. Tim, stop making up games, please. The Church in the Darkness is on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.
