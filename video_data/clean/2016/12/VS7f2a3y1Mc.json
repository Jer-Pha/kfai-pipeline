I think it has issues, I think that it is way too long and there's a lot of editing problems, and there's more than one scene that I can like point out and be like \"that should be cut\" and that's not good for a movie of this caliber because it really should just be like trim all the fat. Having said that, are you kidding me? This was great, it was so great, and I, I was telling Nick this a couple days ago, I was like he asked me, he was like \"do you think that we'll ever have something that makes you feel the magic that The Force Awakens did\" and it's like that movie had so much hype going into it and so much just like expectations, and we were just like man this is going to be amazing, and then it was, and it had that payoff of like \"oh my God these characters and these the sounds and these like things that we we love so much are\"",

Where was someone imitating what Star Wars should be and it's like it's like what a cartoon tries to do a Star Wars score but they're like we can't do the Star Wars score kind of do it that's kind of what it sound like, yeah. And so like I I was telling Kevin this when we we first saw like the score did feel off to me, but then when it felt right it felt real parts of it were great there was just the part where I'm like I just want the goddamn Star Wars theme like I don't understand like the main thing like why isn't it why aren't we having that triumphant moment and at Parts at Parts it felt almost comical uh how the music kind of align with the visuals and I was like ah all",

I have to go back and listen to that because I don't remember that. So it was cool, there were little cool nods or whatever, but R2 and C-3PO in particular seemed redundant because of the end. Because they're there, they're on the Corillian Corvette, so we know they're there; we don't need to see them. Plus, let's be honest, we've seen them already. We've already seen him in episode 7, we saw him right? So not you know, it's cool, it's fun, but it's not a hit like wow hits you right in the heartstrings. Cameo, it just...

They just like, right this is where they are. And I think that that was pretty neat. And I like that that was one of the major things about this movie that I think is really cool. It built the lore in a really cool way. And to go back to what you're saying about why did Vader have the Imperial guards, I liked that on the Jedha planet when it's just like, all right, cool; this is the Jedi kind of holy space or whatever. That whole thing added so much layering that we didn't even know... Like we've gotten so much from the prequels about the Jedi and the Sith and all this stuff. But metan and in the Mordant...

They should have never shown Leia's face; totally show it was so **** cool seeing her. It's the same way I feel in an episode where I'm like, what they should have done is never showed Luke; just have a cloaked guy on screen, and you know it's him. You know? Like, and that would have been or is it... you know, especially in Episode 7, I was like, maybe it isn't; it clearly was L. You didn't need to show that; that's a Walking Dead moment. You don't want to do that; that's a bad cliffhanger, not a good one. So I feel like Leia... we know her iconic look, even if she was behind a character and you see her buns; it's clearly L.

A lot of people are saying that this is a very Empire Strikes Back like movie and I think it is, um, and it makes me wonder if it makes it gives me hope that they're not going to ape Empire with episode 8 because I feel like they aped the tone of Empire with this movie and so I think that there is a signal being sent through this movie that they know that The Force Awakens was New Hope and they're not going to do Empire because this was Empire in its tone. Nick, what are you saying? Oh, just shout out to the casting crew - I mean, they did a great job, and I was just looking up his his cinematographer because I thought it was shot pretty beautifully, uh, who is Greg Fraser?
