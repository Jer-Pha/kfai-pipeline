The one thing that I want to throw in there which is kind of a curveball is texting in particular - cell phones have always done this but texting in particular, the rise of texting over the last almost 10 years, I guess, I mean people have been texting since the 90s, but you know when we really started text messaging, um, I feel like people text just to text sometimes and I don't like the idea that when you call or text someone that you owe them a response necessarily, like it's a complicated kind of thing because it's so easy - I'm hearing from people that I'm like why are you even no offense but like why are you telling me this or like why and then we have to have a conversation about this so I'm trying to be also",

It's just as bad as someone calling you, leaving a message saying, 'Hey man, call me back, you mother.'\" I checked my voicemail for this, that's why visual VOA, visual VOA, and transcribing is the best like yeah cuz it's funny to like what Siri made of that. Um, Greg takes on the L, the **** because it goes back to you know we were talk I mean it's not an original or new idea I think this is in comedy sketches and whatnot but the idea that like \"Why are you calling me?\" Who calls people?

I will never in my entire life handle something that matters with you over text ever. Yeah, if it's too hear your tone now. First off, you are a huge hypocrite. You get that response because if I don't respond, I'm going to hear about it, and you just said not every text needs a response, but when I send the approval, that's blah blah blah blah blah blah oh man what else is there to say? What else is there to say? You're a hypocrite. You're forcing me into a conversation I don't want to be in. You're a huge hypocrite.
