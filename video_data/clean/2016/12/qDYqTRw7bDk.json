As you know, Greg Miller, we talk about video games, all things we love about them, all the things we don't like about them, all that stuff every week, right?

And I it feels like a, you know, good horror movie. It made me jump at one point when the mannequin fell down. Now I got the bad ending, but I'm getting off track. You can go play this on PSN. Um, but trying even the different control schemes, right? Because there's the one where you have it and you can just you free look and you use the stick to, you know, actually move your orientation, but you can look around however you want to.

I was saying that I was a little bit sick off of just free the free motion, whatever. I talked about smooth controls during the PSX panel and kids have hit me up since then to say I should try, you know, dialing it from 30\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 to all these different ways and that might do it. So, it's going to be one to sit down and **** around with. I I'm I take back my words that I think it's going to get delayed. It seems like it's very far along. They seem confident in it.

I don't know how scary it'll be that way, but I guess PT we all loved that way. So, it won't be I'm just worried that people are going to get it in their head that this is a full-fledged 8 hour horror VR game and then they're going to get it and it's going to be harder to do that and that's going to blow up in their face.

I talked about it on the panel, right, where I got into the X-wing and turning around and seeing the R2 unit back there. Like that's dope. And it was talking to me and checking around. But I mean, it's just, you know, obviously VR, we've talked about it so many times being this amazing immersive thing, but it takes stuff like Star Wars to really up the ante. And like that's why I think the Batman experience is so good is because it's stuff that you're so familiar with that experiencing it, it feels right. And it's like, oh man...

They're cool, but I think that the Star Wars stuff, having the Star Wars music and TIE fighters zipping around and the big destroyer coming over you, it's like that was an awesome moment. The sense of scale and stuff, it really does feel like you're in the movies and it's kind of a weird thing where it's a game, but it's also an experience. So, it's still in that halfway. And that's the thing about it, even from the little bit we played, right, it was the fact that it is not on rails, but it was all right, cool. I'm flying. I'm flying. All right, now we're in combat and I'm no longer moving this. I'm just aiming and I'm I can move in 360 degrees, right? Or maybe just 180 over over, you know, ass over teacup kind of thing.

Wave one of VR. How does this all apply? This seems like a great application. It was fun. Uh like you're saying, like even me not being a Star Wars nerd, reaching over and hitting the button and having the little targeting reticle pop out and have it right there. I was like, that's awesome. That's really cool. My thing is I liked it a lot more than my time with Eve Valkyrie because Eve Valkyrie it just it missed that that level of oh it's Star Wars right it just like it was like all right cool the initial experience of it super awesome but then you're out there flying in space and it's kind of like all right cool this game is",

Where do we go from here? And like similar to that, not that this would happen with the Eve creators CCP, right? Uh the fact that what happens when All right, cool. You're a developer.

So, those are other things that it's starting on PlayStation, but they have the right to bring it anywhere they want. I assume it'll be on everything eventually. So, for Xbox fans specifically who have only gotten one Housemarque game ever, and for PC gamers who have never gotten a housemarque game, I think that that's a good sign for you guys. Tim, what' you play? Finally got my hands on Yooka-Laylee. Oh, we didn't talk about this at all yet. Okay. Yeah. And it's it's definitely exactly what it's supposed to be.

But the criticism is the camera. Uh it's attached to the other stick, which is good, but it does the thing that old 3D platformers used to do where when you move the left stick to control your character, it also moves the camera. And I'm like, \"No, no, fix. Let me set the camera where I want.\" And I'm going to be really surprised if they don't change that or at least give an option to turn that off uh when it comes out because that can't be something that people are cool with.

I think that they are just as good as anything in Inside from an understanding how to get through this room, understanding how to get through that room. They're varied enough where you very rarely are doing the exact same thing over and over. Mechanics from other puzzles are brought back by using a different but in different ways. Um, I like that.

Again though, I think that this game could have learned from things like Inside where Inside was a tight experience. Gave me everything I needed.

It's like no, give me the right experience. And I feel like this it was stretched out a little bit much. Like there was a couple moments that do repeat from a uh story perspective where I'm like, \"All right, there's only I had Uncharted syndrome with a couple things where some of the set pieces started to feel repetitive.\" Um where I'm like, \"This was super cool the first time, but in Uncharted when it's like it's always the last second when he jumps and grabs the thing right before post.\" And it's like that happened in this game over and over and over and over like how many times are",

And I think that again, it's one of those games like Inside where you're constantly questioning why things are happening and what's going on. And I feel like at the end it pays off. And I think it pays off from a gameplay experience and story level. It's just that the moment-to-moment gameplay can be a little bit too frustrating to be worth as long of a drawn out experience as it is.

Yeah, some mother **** Uh, I thought that was interesting as a topic for this because I I think that this needed to be a game to have the type of resonance that it does or else it is just a fairly generic story. I think that the fact that you are playing and that there are those frustrations that you have uh with with Trico, it makes it all worth it or else you're just getting an attempt at a Hayao Miyazaki movie. And I don't I think that that's not a bad thing. Sure. But I do think that the you earn your relationship. You earn it.",

Well, I'm saying but having said that, again, not to beat a dead horse, I don't think it needed to be 12 hours of that. And I think that uh for you guys having experienced as much as you did, maybe you should experience a little bit more. There's a couple just key story moments that you need to see just to understand things that happen. But I still I feel like the end would be just as special um having only had the experiences that you guys had with it. Like it the end is special just because of what it does a good job of every single thing happening at once. Yeah. Is that moment?

I'm interested in the winners. I don't watch them. But if we want to celebrate game creators then and the people that work so hard on these games and let's do that and not worry about getting eyeballs based on reveals.

But like the thing there is again trying to step away from the Academy Awards and think more of it as an MTV movie awards or VMAs where it's like what happens at those shows, trailers for new games, performances by artists, and they give away a couple awards. And I think that that's what this is. And I think that this it stands alone then because it's not quite an E3 where it's just uh messages being delivered by the people who are making the games and that's all that it is and numbers and graphs and all that stuff.

And I think that that is what its goal is. Whereas the gamers wanting to celebrate games, they're going to IGN to see what IGN's game of the year is, you know, and **** about in the comments. Um, and then on the other side, they're going to wherever it is they go to get their trailers and stuff to give their opinion on the new movies they've seen. This is ironically unique in the gaming world. And I think it's necessary because like it's enjoyable. It's entertainment content.

Those are ones where I don't feel those are meant to be watched necessarily. You know GDC is always the GDC awards and the Independent Games Festival Awards. I IDGAF, they're all at the same time.

And I think that's that is really what this all boils down to. And I know that I'm beating a dead horse again, but it's just like there's so much behind the scenes stuff that make these things the way that they are. It's not like Geoff Keighley is making this and is just like I'm blind and deaf and don't hear and don't understand what you guys are saying. It's that I hear what you're saying, but there's a but, you know? And I think that we are really making good steps towards the games getting better and better.

I can watch the I can look at the a recap later and see who won and see who had good speeches. And that is a thing that I want to give a shout out to and I said this during the the show itself, but I think that your speech motivated people to step their speech game up. Because it's, oh, it's the Game Awards. You win stuff. Cool. You get to go. Thank my mom, thank my dad. Thank my team. Cool. Bye. But it's like, no. Because of your speech, you took that seriously and you had a platform. You put your money where your mouth is when it comes to this conversation and you tried making the Game Awards better. You tried making the Game Awards what it should be. And I think that you changed them. I think that every speech that we saw this",

And I I I think that Nolan coming out and taking the opportunity to say the things he said was powerful and awesome. I guess that's part of it. Maybe that's part of this why this one is I feel a step back or weird is the fact that you're right the speeches all were good and so it was that juxtaposition of going from Nolan's speech of like holy **** everyone and a lot of people didn't even like really catch I'm like holy **** he's talking about like he's the first ever giant video game actor to come out and be like this strike's ****",

Um, especially now with PS4 Pro and like with all the patches and stuff and like where we're going to get to a point",

But where we're at right now, it's like, oh man, like Final Fantasy XV, the pro stuff's not fully ready or um other games that are going to be coming out like The Last Guardian's stuff, it's like just knowing that they're still working out the kinks with all this stuff. It's like, h I do want to wait. I do want the better experience. Um and I I think that, you know, there's pros and cons on both ways. And like I I'm not even taking the sales into consideration. And like if I want a game, I'm going to pay what I need to pay to play the game. Whether it's 45, 60, or you know, $120. It's like if I want it, I'm I'm not ever going to buy a game that I'm not informed enough",

Just that experience is going to be worth $60 to me with. Like for example, The Last Guardian, like that's a game that to me would be worth $60 just for the experience of playing it. Um but but yeah, it's also the idea of waiting bothers me and like I think it really kind of depends on what it is you're waiting for. Uh when it comes to most the type of DLC that we get, I'm like I don't really care if I get a bunch of alternate skins um and stuff like that. It's like when it comes to the game's going to play better, sure. Uh but the like this Final Fantasy XV patch that they're talking about today, all that **** I'm like whatever.

You know, or things that once I beat the game, I can always just YouTube later. I think that's the other big part is just like if there's added content, do I really need to play it or can I just look at the sure the **** later? Think about this, too. We could go to the future. We could watch Justice League right now. We can watch We can watch Spider-Man: Homecoming right now. Yeah, I would do that. Justice League.

John L says, \"Is DLC as we know it going to follow the Ubisoft path of removing barriers to fully enjoy a game?\" I don't think so. I mean, how often does the DLC really ruin enjoying the game, though? I I think Prince of Persia is the one everybody I go back to all the time when we talk about this conversation where they put the real ending into DLC. You're like, \"Go **** yourselves.\" Yeah. You kidding me? The game wasn't that great to begin with. You're going to do this to us. It was good. It was good. It was that. It wasn't nearly good enough for me to buy the DLC ending.

The story stuff uh The Last of Us: Left Behind, you. It's like that's not you're not owed that. That's not stuff that's blocking you from enjoying The Last of Us to understand what Ellie's backstory was in this prequel thing.

Yeah. And it's I feel like more often than not recently things have been more right than wrong.

My dude here says, \"You don't talk about PC much, but could you give a shout out to Planet Coaster, bringing the roller coaster tycoon glory days back?\" Sure. Shout out. Shout out to Planet Coaster. I hope you're enjoying it on your PC. I just got a PS4 game, Bridge Constructor. I'm looking forward to constructing some bridges. You know how many bridges there are in America? Millions. And I want what was it? If you haven't if you didn't like Batman v Superman to jump off them. Good lord. I make a good point.

Is there anything that you find yourself drawn back to around this time of year? Holiday comfort food for gamers, as it were. Now, old game is old. I don't like going backwards. It's rare that I pop in an old game. I think Christmas I have games tied to Christmas memories. I was talking about Mario 64, right? My parents gave me the N64 and Mario 64 in the traditional Christmas story red Ryder BB gun thing where I opened all my other presents and then they sent me downstairs for something stupid and then coming back upstairs. It was there against the hall tree. That's a good little memory. And then sitting there playing the console",
