Tim, you grew up three hours in a place where it snows. I've been to that place a few times, Tahoe. Yeah, yeah, yes, you're right. I mean, there are multiple times that come to mind of those were the coldest type of times I've ever been in my life. One time I got dragged to an NFL Pro Bowl game in San Fran - it was at Levi's Stadium, go to that current owner's mom's sister worked for somebody who got free tickets. Isn't a Pro Bowl right? A Pro Bowl is what it was. Yeah, I don't know so much about that. So we went, we went to this thing and oh man my nipples - my nipples were so hard, hard as they... hurt, they hurt.",

The whole reason we call it the Tundra's because the first time you ever watched the footage back from one of these wrestling matches when it got really bad, it was just us yelling over it - I was just talking or whatever - it's like okay, we gotta play this into the canon of this and we call it a good one.
