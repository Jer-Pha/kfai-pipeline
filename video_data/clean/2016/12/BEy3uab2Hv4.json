Super Giant Games who made a huge splash on PS4 with Hitman (corrected from \"hits transistor\") and Bastion are back with Py, a party-based RPG in Py you'll lead a band of Exiles to Freedom through a series of mystical competitions. It's beautiful, crazy stylish and a ton of fun to play. And here at PSX, you can be the first to play both, you can be the first to play both the single player and a new head-to-head versus mode. Super Giant Games is first into multiplayer gaming. Let's take a closer look at Py as well as some of the other unique games coming from our third party.",
