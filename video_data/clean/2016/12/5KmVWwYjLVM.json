The other gaming-centric personality that inspires me is seasoned industry veteran Jeremy Parish, who I consider to be the single smartest, most informed, and most educational member of the games media. Jeremy takes a different tack than Jim, prioritizing his raw knowledge and keen intellect into something more akin to a documentary than a think piece. As it turns out, his YouTube shows Game Boy World and Good Intentions are criminally under-viewed and under-appreciated, but they're neither under-viewed nor under-appreciated by me. I like what he does and how he does it, and his buttoned-up approach makes for the perfect balance to what Jim does. Peppering the inspiration I receive from these two gentlemen with what I already do just makes a ton of sense to me, and I thank them for their hard work and continued contributions to our field outside of games. I have to point to two shows in particular: Last Week Tonight",
