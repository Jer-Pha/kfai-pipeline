So well that's the thing about knowing I I think about how bold you really are, and the fact that Colin talks non-stop **** about mobile games, and I'm always like I don't play mobile games either, I don't like them, but for you to come out be like I am a hardcore gamer, I did Xbox Live Arcade, and I have something special here, I thought was impressive.
