All right, let's do it. But anyways, yeah, so it was great for Grant Gustin to do that take because he's clearly in his trailer; he's in the Star Labs shirt, like he's about to go to set. It's just like, man, that's awesome, and now he has my custom video. He's like, \"Hey Greg, hope you have a great day.\" No, I made sure he says his last name because I thought it was only for me, I swear. When I sent Grant Gustin this giant DM thread of like, \"Hey, we've never talked so I thought I'd start by asking for a favor,\" and I go through all this stuff, I made sure to put the full name in there so he's not like, \"No, we're going to make a video for Greg.

And I was like, 'Can we do that?' And he's like, 'Why not?' So we just put money, and then they just started. And then it totally worked out in our favor because at first, they started giving us like 20 bucks right. And then year two, they started one-upping each other so it went up to 50 bucks by the time we were done. We were getting 100 bucks per... uh, uncle aunt Uncle couple, and it was pretty amazing 'cause we have five, so it was like 500 bucks great yeah I was like, '**** MK toys.' That's my thing.
