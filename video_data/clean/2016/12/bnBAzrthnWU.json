I somehow beat it before Greg which was insane because of the the the who knew it was going to be first because of the crashing and all this kind of stuff happened. Yeah, yeah well it was more insane cuz you actually played a Telltale Game before they were all out that was the interesting one.

Uh, I think that there are a lot of technical issues. I actually had a back and forth today with the CEO of Telltale on Twitter where he was asking about what the problems were and I told him and then I, I reflected after that, I'm like, you know, I really guys, I really hope you figure out these problems out, like your narrative and your storytelling and your characters deserve a better engine. And frankly, um, just to get the negative out of the way, uh, Batman is another engineering failure, um, on Telltale's part and, uh, especially the fifth episode, um, I, I want to go through this like actually what we saw in episode 5 cuz that like outside of this we talked about on Conor Greg live I had the little hitches like the tale hitch I always call it where you're about to transition scenes in the other episodes I was like all right",

I mean, that's what they're telling me now, like not literally but that's what they're saying by putting this game out in this condition. We still don't give a **** about this; sorry. So that's that's my take away on the negative side. That said, the overwhelming positivity I have for the game is that the storytelling was great. Um, I tried to play it in the in the way that first of all it felt like there were really consequential decisions to be made and the game actually radically changed.

Where any moment where you're walking around a scene or identifying things, I'm like, \"I don't need to see or do any of this.\" Just show me; make it more of a pure adventure game where I'm making decisions and the things are going, and I'm selecting these on-screen options. But you don't have to. I feel like they throw this stuff in because they feel like they have to, and I don't think it adds anything to the game. Actually, I think it detracts from the game. I think the most exciting parts of the game are when you're... The first episode's a great example: when Bruce Wayne is with Harvey at the man at some sort of political fundraiser, and it's just a long time of just making decisions, just walking around; you're not controlling anything; you're just selecting options.",

Well, I'm talking more more of maybe for more of a point and click or uh or Hidden Object kind of game where I I'm like I I don't like hidden object games I actually reviewed one for IGN for some reason, but like something like more static screen less um more agency given through less Locomotion of the character.

Um, and to do that it might have worked because Call of Duty sales seem to be down about 20 or 25%. But the thing is, Activision anticipated this because it's uh Infinity Ward's turn, and they're just not as beloved anymore as they used to be. Treyarch is really the King of the Hill in that regard, and uh they took a franchise that could have been flailing, could have done something.

Um, a 50% fall off or even a 20% or a 30% fall off on a sequel when you expect sequels to usually sell better historically in video games or at least attract people to the old game and then get into the new game means that there will be no Titanfall 3.

So you if you see a vibrant kind of resurgence in handheld gaming then you want to go back there and compete because money can be made there, and that's what a rational business would do.
