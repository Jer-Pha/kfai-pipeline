Just really simple instructions. If you go to this link, probably about to go watch some porn or something, man. God knows what the kids in this group. Uh, so I guess we'll see what happens. There's also a uh envelope says don't open till the video tells me to. So hopefully it's nothing too crazy or weird. Okay, so we're going to go see what's going on. Wait, hold up. Oh, what's up, Greg Kislowski? It's me, Greg Miller from KindaFunny.com. No, what the hell? You hit the jackpot, huh? Yeah. Enter into one of these Kinda Funny community Secret Santa things.

The man who a long time ago said, \"Let's talk to Colin.\" And that began the dream. That is Kinda Funny. First off, thank you for being a Kinda Funny best friend. Amazing that you number one support us. Number two, you joined up for this community Secret Santa business. Thank you very much for doing that. Um, so let's start talking about what I've got gotten you. Of course, you got the manila envelope. You opened it up. There was a piece of paper in there and an envelope that is right here.

You had no idea. Hopefully, it was me until you got here and you saw the Kinda Funny stuff. Congratulations on that part. Now, for the Kinda Funny community Secret Santa thing, this is year two and I believe the dollar limit is $25 or $20. Is that right, Greg? That sounds in the ballpark, right? We don't know. So, that's going on. We don't know. Um I What you have here in this envelope is a Polaroid. A Polaroid of me, Greg Miller, that I took in my bedroom. Not in a sexy sense. Sorry. Sign. Go ahead and open it. Now, the thing about this Polaroid, probably worth more than $25 to someone. Far less than $25 to others. If I ever run for president or murder someone, values go up as well.",

I've crushed it. It's over. You don't need to worry about it. I've hit the $25 limit. Great. But of course, I'm Greg Miller. And like I said, as one of the founders of Kinda Funny, one of the idiots who keeps the heart pumping around here, I feel like I have to go above and beyond and give you more. As they say, as the hit song said, \"more, more\" once bitten, twice shy, baby. Now, you can leave off the second part. Just the \"more, more\" part is the thing. So, I look at your information sheet here. I didn't give you I see all about you and Greg, of course, good name. Uh, go through here. You're from New York. That's what I saw. And I figured",

You've either never had Portillo's or you've had Portillo's and already know it's great and now miss it in New York. So what I'm doing is sending you Portillo's. Of course, Portillo's ships around the country. I'm sending you the 10 hot dog pack. They give you all the fixings you need to make your own Chicago hot dogs. They give you instructions. And if you're filming this and you're watching this, I already know you're good at following instructions. Do not ignore instruction one of Portillo's uh home catering thing.
