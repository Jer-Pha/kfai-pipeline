Like the amount of people who own Splatoon compared to having Wii U is mind-blowing. So to me, but to me, it's like this is a small and shrinking audience. And no matter how good the games are, Splatoon as good as it is on Wii U probably would have sold even way better if it was on PS4 and Xbox One. So you have to look at Nintendo's ability to just push hardware because people just don't believe in it - it's weak, it's gimmicky traditionally. It's weak traditionally, it's gimmicky. And traditionally it only has Nintendo games. And if you can't rely on a prolific output - I mean the output needs to be she was talking about three months' gaps. I feel like the gaps with quality products on Wii U have been longer than that. And I think that for them to really survive, they're going to need a Nintendo or Triple-A game like every month, month and a half.",

And it's like, are you with their limited studio? I mean, they have a big first-party but like there's not enough resources for them to do that. They need to have third-party support because a game as great as Super Smash Bros., a game as great as Mario Kart, or whatever - not that they released a true 3D Mario game, I assume that will obviously be a launch game as well. Um, to me it's like you have to have more than that. Nintendo can't sell hardware based on its own games anymore, which is why they should just become a publisher. So I'm interested to see um how the NX does. I'm kind of indifferent to it - like I root for it in the sense that I just it's hard to believe Nintendo couldn't be a hardware manufacturer but it's also like you know",

I mean I agree with you, like if I had control I would just make that happen and Nintendo just make games for other consoles and it would just be a done deal. It's not going to happen now so I'm rooting for the NX, I want this to happen and what excites me is this talk about consolidating the teams and we've heard a lot about restructurings at Nintendo like the EAD team supposedly is renamed, is different now it's not even just them making console games, it's the 3DS teams and the Wii U teams are now going to be working together on as making games and I think that that that to me is exciting because for at least a couple years like early on the Wii U and the\"",

When you combined the two, most people look at Nintendo fans as Nintendo fans, not necessarily Wii U fans or 3DS fans; it's like there was a good solid stream coming divided across two things, which is not ideal. If we get that output on both the NX, I think that's great - that's a great thing to add on some third-party support and add on some other things. What's really exciting me is something Nintendo's not always done since the GameCube era, where they partner with and trust third parties, and I think that's a great way to use third parties to make Nintendo games; there's no limit to the amount of Nintendo games they can make - they have so many franchises that can have so many spin-offs and so much potential.",
