ChapStick, I do a lot of people say chapstick doesn't do it, it actually does the opposite of what it's supposed to do, like dries your lips out, I think you get addicted to it well for put it on, you start doing the your lips look ridiculous, it dries it out. Kevin, give me a close-up on my lips, they look like some Kylie Jenner **** oh God, you, you can put more on than that, you're not even trying right now, I hate chapstick man, it makes my food taste all shitty, I ain't down, Jesus Christ, I can't unsee that, I'm going to be slow jerking into that later, I'm not going to lie, I might have",

And the problem is, I feel like you get a fourth of the way down into a tube of ChapStick and then it gets all messed up, it melts, it runs into the cap; you bring it up, it's like a jagged edge or whatever. We talked about this guy hasn't melted or broken yet; I'm just putting that out there. We talked about this on Colin Moriarty's live stream last week, which is ironic for this topic, where I said I got through an entire thing of ChapStick and that was impressive, and like, and also the big lighter I had that I used for a year, but what were you lighting again with that?

I'll tell you the best thing you can do is sleep: go home and get two good nights of sleep before you do this thing - that's the one thing you can't buy. You have to do it. I like throwing money at problems, but get a tomato and cut it in half over your eyes; lay down for 20 minutes. Uh-huh, is that it? I just want to do it: get a grapefruit.
