Grandma Zigga said this topic is also brought to you by Patreon. Thank you all for making things happen for us. There's your thank you crawl, what we call it. Kevin's going to put it. Really?

But the most difficult is like we're excited about him because I've never had a difficult time in like holding on to information. I'm excited to unleash information. I mean I assume that's what he's asking. Like I mean I read this as what's the thing that when you heard you're like \"I can't wait for people to know this.\" I will say that I mean the way he poses the question I think Greg would agree is that he's like, \"Well until the NDA was up.\" I've signed very few NDAs compared to the amount of secrets I know.

Um, I don't know that I want to get into specifics, but I will say that there's a great deal of stuff that you know about if you're well connected in this industry before it happens. Um, and uh, well, a good example is the God of War stuff that happened recently. Like, I've known about that sort for a couple years, and Greg has too. We heard rumblings about that forever, but it's until you could substantiate it.

I don't I've never published anything without getting it from multiple sources that were comfortable with me using them as an anonymous source, if that makes any sense. So people will be like, well, they're obviously going to stay anonymous, but they also don't want you to use that as they're not a source. So that's not like checking one of the boxes. I have one source. It's like, well, you hear this and then maybe you can go chase a story, whatever. So, the Norse stuff with God of War is a good example. We heard that from multiple people um over time over time. And I believe that's 100% true because of the people that told us that.

Luke has two U's, though, so not full credit for Look at me. Hey guys, look at me. My question pertains to the video game industry as a whole. I've lived in Michigan my whole life, so the large conventions and most of the video game industry presence as a whole is absent from the area, even though I think the industry could thrive here. I was wondering what areas of the country you think we could see the industry grow in the future.

So I think you know so that's that's why you find studios in Texas and in Washington because you get an automatic raise moving there. You get a raise subtracting the percentage of state income tax you pay and it's cheaper to run businesses there. I think New York is eventually going to thrive again. Uh there's Rockstar is a huge developer in New York, but um taxes are very onerous there usually, but they have a lot of new small business and like zeroing out tax rules basically in New York now to attract people back there, especially upstate New York. So I think you'll see companies kind of thriving there as well. And then um you know, I think that obvious honestly I think the revolution is kind of happening as I've said before in Eastern Europe um because of lack of tax regulations and because of um it's just cheaper cost of living.",

I mean because you have to because you have to remember Michigan's actually a beautiful state. Um and there's a lot of money and and you know uh you know talent there for sure. Um but you the idea is to open a studio in a place where people want to move like you have to be able to attract talent from other places. So, um, Insomniac in North Carolina, as far as I understand, one of the reasons that they put it there was because they needed to attract talent from the East Coast that didn't want to necessarily relocate to California. And it was a smart move for them to put it there because they were able to say, \"Well, this guy's from Georgia, but he doesn't",

Are you are you going to be able to attract people wanting to go to Lansing or to, you know, Ann Arbor or something? I don't think so. I mean, I So, I I think that that's one of the things, and that's no offense to Michigan. It's just that it's easy to say like we're in Seattle or we're in um New York City or we're in Austin. Um as opposed to being like, well, we're in, you know, Cheyenne, Wyoming or something. And you can run certainly run a very cheap studio there, but you're going to be able to get anyone to go there.

I think individually it's like if you really want to be part of the industry, like you need to go to it. Don't wait for it to come to you. And I think that's good advice for anything really, you know? It's like you can there's so much options to make things happen and it's way easier for you to change your life than for hundreds of other people that changed their lives. Sure.

Also, given this year marks Sonic's 25th anniversary, do you think Sega will release a new game? Will the series ever regain the popularity it once had? I hope against hope that that happens. Much love from the city of brotherly love. You got a lot of promise, man. NWO Hollywood there. Yeah. No, it'll never get as popular as it once was. That's come and gone. Uh, yeah. I grew up a Sega kid. I grew up thinking Sonic the Hedgehog was boss. Loved him. Had a great time with him. And then yeah, you go back and play this game, you're like, \"Oh, no, no, no, no.

It also has its issues. Sure. But I think as platforming games, they're great. Compared to Mario, absolutely. They're not perfect.

Saturday morning cartoons reign supreme. But I think now in the world of the movies and stuff like we're seeing with Ratchet and Clank, like with the Sonic movie they announced. Is that going to do good? Probably not. Because already I think Ratchet's what we were talking about earlier doing the right moves of it is very much the game being made into a movie.

It was it was the way for them to revive the console in the west. It was a way for them to compete with Nintendo to make Nintendo seem kitty and and irrelevant by ma by using terms like blast processing and all these kinds of things, but really it didn't mean anything.

It's all about how Sega revived um Genesis using Sonic and and and there's a lot of really interesting **** about Sonic in there and and who created it and Team Sonic and all that kind of stuff, the studio and how it's a very western game.
