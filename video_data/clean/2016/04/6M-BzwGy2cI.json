Uh, topic two is Mike Bithell, the one and only Mike Bithell, of course. Made Thomas Was Alone, found enormous success, put out Volume, it came to some platform, the PlayStation 4, and stuff nobody cared about, then it came to Vita, everyone went wild for it, and then to make it even crazier for Mike Bithell, he's taking it to the next Dimension. He yeah, he is. Wow good one, he announced that yeah, the PlayStation Vita version Volume Coda is coming as well, and is a free add-on to regular Volume. So we brought him in of course during GDC to talk to him about Volume Coda, and of course Volume getting a little physical packaging, that's exciting. We had our best talk to him about it Colin Moriarty and Nick Scarpino what they... we had our best talk to him and Nick yeah how is uh how's GDC treating I hell it sound wrong um really good it's a",

Like, I get it, like I'm you know press have the hardest time at these events because they are running from room to room. I get to see in a room showing off for like four days right?

It's so... it's still top-down, it's still... it's still you're viewing kind of an isometric uh space uh, so if you've played Volume, you know it's kind of that like say like Melus' solid VR kind of top-down camera um, but it takes place in this kind of cool VR environment. You're sat with a controller or stood with a controller and it's a hologram in front of you of the level.

It's a really... it's really... it's it's you know it's taking that sounds Twisted, it is it is weird and cool and it's a fun toy. I I remember when we were talking like very early on like just kind of working out the high level design of it we were like um we I I always use the reference of like I want people to be able to like play with the window of a car, like you know when you're a kid you're like just fiddling with the window and making go up and down off your grandma exactly.

This was the kind of solution where we had versions where it auto-did its thing and it was all dynamic, but it's like, no, people want to fiddle with the windows, they want to mess around with stuff. Um, so this feels like a good way of taking the volume gameplay we have and putting into a VR context, and then doing new things, continuing the story with some new characters, it's cool.

Everything so, I mean, I, I, just am, I, I, you know, for me, I'm, I'm the most casual gamer in all of our group, obviously by far, by, by a huge margin. So, for me to actually rectify putting that on at night would just be uh, it's just too far of a stretch for me. It's like everything else that really just depends on what the experience is going to be, what's the game that's going to sell it for me, what's going to be that addictive thing that I have to have. But I mean, it has the capacity to be as impactful to the industry as like say a DualShock controller right, like it really does if the experience is there. I think the price is going to really help with that, like it, it is a it's placed at that console level especially for early adopters, like if you're if you're someone who, like me, went out and bought a PS4 on launch day then you might be ready for like another big hardware investment and I think it.",
