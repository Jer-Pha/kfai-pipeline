No, not at all; that's how much being a good human being costs $1. I don't give a ****, Pilla **** if there was no repc I will smear **** on the sidewalk with my hand for as long as it takes to get it clean. Greg, what could these people do with the dollar?

Nice, which is my favorite part of the entire process. And we've heard about it from J.K. Rowling and then when we were down in Austin, we were hanging out with Jeff Rubin of Achievement Hunter fame, yes, and he was telling us about his wife, Gracie, who is an ASMR artist, has a channel on YouTube, and has a whole channel dedicated to this, and I was like that sounds crazy. Started looking into it apparently a lot of people have channels that do these videos and they get a lot of views. Do we need to start Kinda Funny ASMR? We might have to.

There are two other things that aren't ASR: there's something called frisson, and misophonia. Fricson is when it's music-based - so it's that shiver you get when you hear music cues. I get that all the time, so I understand that; it's pleasurable and gives me a chill for less than 5 seconds. That's not ASMR, like in Batman v Superman exactly when the Wonder Woman theme plays and hits me. Yeah, um, but they're different. People get upset when you incorrectly mix the two.

I think we should do these videos for you. There it is. Is this working for you? Am I lulling you into a false sense of security? It kind of reminds me of like the rave phase when everyone put lights on their fingers, those sticky light shows and stuff. Yeah, the glow-in-the-dark things remind me of that. This is weird; it's weird that this is as big as it is because it's such an innate thing that just people have in them, and it either affects people or it doesn't. But it's kind of like the blue and gold dress situation where it sounds crazy, but it undeniably either works or does not work with everybody. Then that sounds like a stupid statement, but it's like it's weird how I could be like, \"Oh man, I don't either like it or it doesn't.\"",

Doesn't necessarily mean that they've mastered like inter travel right? So it's it's many hundreds of times more sophisticated than us though yes they need make like a space bridge and you have to remember that for them to build that Dyson Sphere, they need to figure out how to get close to the star without there's a bunch of technology.

That's why we have to figure out clever ways to manipulate time, that's like why the time travel we don't time travel, we go really fast and then come back and then time has moved faster you know.
