So we did that and it sort of made it okay for other corporations to do it, like other companies. Then you'd see like The Chive doing one and College Humor doing one and all these different people.com. I mean, sorry to make you guys do that.

So you got this like seriously, you're this entire global comedic economy, like working off of a joke that kind of has its own rules and like the bigger it gets, the more people want to like fight against those rules. So like people find a way to invert the rules or do a weird... weird stuff with it, and it's a it's sort of a challenge to become creative inside of a really strict rubric, and then in two weeks it implodes, and you find the next joke.

I'm a huge gamer; I love video games. But the cool thing about gamers is that they use YouTube how YouTube wants to be used \u2013 like, people will subscribe, people will build a community around something, and people interact with you on Twitter.

Well, it's similar to sort of like the movie poster mentality, right? Where you've got an image and a tagline, and that's pretty much it. Mhm. Um, and that does make a lot of sense. Yeah.
