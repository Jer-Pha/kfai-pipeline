I played a little bit at PSX a week ago. I mean, it's great. It's Ratchet and Clank. I've always loved the way Ratchet and Clank feels; the physics is like right there for me, and just playing with the weapons is fun. It's what I like about 3D Platformers. And anyways... um Reg Clank always feels exactly how I want it to feel. And that was one of those games where I without platinuming it and whatever I wanted to get all the weapons and I wanted to max out all the weapons, and I would play and I'd grind just to be able to grind them all out to maximize all the... and get up to the levels and stuff.

It's going to sell millions of copies; I'm so excited for it. Yeah, can't wait to see how it all wraps up. It's crazy; it's the end. So, you've heard rumblings; I haven't spoken to you about this, but do you think it's going to get delayed? Yeah, I mean that's been my theory for a while. I saw Neil at PSX; I know you're so vehement every time I talk to him in every interview and every panel that I'm gonna prove Cal wrong again. I love it; that's great.

Well, you have to assume they said summer or is that another one I've been saying and now my predictions, my calls, actions... I don't know, I'm convinced that that's a PSVR launch game because I said so. That was one of my predictions; I'm allowed to take that one.

Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth is coming to Vita and PS4, this is a big deal guys because no it is it is because it came out in Japan and stuff and we never really thought we were going to see a North American release but they made it happen there was a lot of petitions people were like \"no we want this\" and it's coming on Vita and PS4 so that's good. Okay, so people asking if I'm gonna play it, I'm definitely going to give this one a shot, you play on Vita, yeah, yeah, hell yeah, all about that Digimon, all about that Digimon V, yeah, digim... um, yeah.

I they don't have this like exorbitant target that's going to have an attach rate of one, like if if the console's at 40 million by the time it launches then the attach rate will be like no more than one in 20 and that's gonna be pretty successful for them.

Um, I don't think this is a gimmick; like I really don't. I think this is really special and it's not just PSVR; it's just VR generally. I think it's Oculus; I think it's just special. I think it works and I think it's going to be amazing what they can do with this in a few years, even not nonetheless 10 or 20 or 30 years, and the gaming applications. I just think it starts as gaming; I mean I think that there's going to be a real like a day when you use Skype on PSVR. I think there's going to be a day when you can go anywhere in the world on PSVR, go into space on PSVR. Like, I think that just... I don't know. Your point; you know what he's saying; like you know what we're talking about; you know Horizon; all these games are somehow VR compatible and not the full I'm using the camera but it's taking everything for me",

I'm using the camera, but it's taking everything in for me. It's the difference between playing a game out there and checking my phone, versus when I was playing The Last of Us, even before I started looking around, it was just like being on headphones and I'm only there. It sounds so funny to think that I could kind of do that here with headphones, but there are always distractions and all these little things and stuff. And granted, we're all going to look like a bunch of weirdos or our significant others glued in doing this thing, but if I'm playing The Last of Us that way, you know what I mean.",

I feel like everything about games are going to get ratcheted up even if it's just the same experience we're playing now. I'd love to play Gone Home again; I'd love to play it VR-wise, but I would also just love to play it and not have anything else to worry about me. And that makes a lot of sense to me - that's where I come in with the whole like the screen needs to be high-quality, and so if it if I mess with it, it's good then I'm totally with you. I feel like it's very similar to like my Apple Watch, where so many people are like, \"Oh, that's a waste of money; why would you even need that? How does that change your life?\" It's like, it's a smart watch - watches are expensive period. Like this one tells me my notifications; I don't need to talk to it like Kevin does.
