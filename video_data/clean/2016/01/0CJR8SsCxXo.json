So having it come back and be something that I think is going to be a big deal, I don't know how great the game will be on these other things, but it will be a big deal when it comes out, I'm excited to see it. Yeah, it's funny you gave me a look when I said Doom 3 like I was just too young for Doom 1 and two, like those games weren't even things that I liked, they were way older than me then also I had no idea how to use a PC back then but yeah Doom 3 was when I was like cognizant and reading about this game coming out and how good it looked and all this stuff so yeah Doom one is uh I'd say one of the five most important games ever launched, so I think that it's um you know",

Um, um, yeah, I, I want to see what ID can do. This is a different ID, and a new ID, and an ID without its leadership or its old leadership. So, I'm interested to see like what they prioritize now. Rage was the last game they released, and, uh, you know, they prioritize fidelity over substance well sometimes with uh, or they're known to do that with some of their games with a kind of obsession with that. So, um, now that he's out of the fold, I'm interested to see like what happens with this, uh, because they're really fascinating studio, even though a lot of their people aren't really there anymore.

Yeah, so it's like uh, like they don't want to do this stuff anymore. I, I don't really blame you know, like, um, God damn them in their success. So, so I don't think they want to be known for like one thing only, so I think there's going to be a big blow out. I think this is going to be like a big, a big you know conclusion to their trilogy, um, even though they've done really technically five of them at this point with Demon's Souls and Bloodborne, uh, so yeah, I think Dark Souls III is gonna be huge, The Division, yeah, can't wait to watch you get crushed.

I don't think it will do it immediately, but uh, I'm excited to see what they're capable of. And this is without Casey Hudson - this is, you know, in a world post Mass Effect 3, Fallout, yeah, like, yeah. A game made in a vacuum, a game in development for a long time and gestating for a while. So I think there will be a lot of expectations on BioWare, but I think that they'll probably meet them.

I'm just saying, I mean I'm going off the Game of Thrones cycle, cuz Game of Thrones was announced at The Game Awards and happened the next year. Sure, so this was announced at The Game Awards, okay. I guess that's true. Yeah, I mean like I'm thinking with Walking Dead schedule, Michonne's going to start the year for sure, and I bet you don't get Walking Dead season 3 until about this time next year. They start them in November December, they put out episode one of Walking Dead season 3, and so then they have to fill in between those things. But I mean they've announced so many things that it's like the Batman announcement. I'm just saying, I wouldn't put it past it that that thing starts in Spring.

That was at E3 we heard about that, we've seen nothing about it, you know what I mean? So it's like um I'm very excited about Michonne though. Oh when you you pitched me on it and you're like dude it's what's happening with her in the comics, hell yes yes yes yes yeah. Like it's a it's a really interesting good idea of like you know I think when there was that DLC between season 1 and season 2 and they put out 400 Days we were all like okay cool who are these people oh you're doing new thing and you get to the game it's like well this didn't tie into anything really that",

Yeah, they could have just literally put that together, nothing else but... other developers don't do that, like you don't even see the gameplay, it's just a CG thing.
