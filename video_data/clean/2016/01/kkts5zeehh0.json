It's also been a while because okay, we had guests and before that, we did the whole looking back at 2015 thing, and so it's like we've been doing a lot of topics that were just like you know lists and stuff like that. This is the normal show getting right into it. Topic one is do you need to play a game to have an opinion on it? Now this is based on a lot of the reactions I saw to the list content that we made over the last couple episodes of the Kinda Funny Gamescast where we're talking about best games of 2015, what we're looking for in 2016 and all this stuff.

Very similar to the conversation we had before about reviewing games. Right? Sure, everyone has their own way to do it, whatever. But I kind of want to get your guys' thoughts on if you're allowed to have an opinion on games without playing them. I don't mean I don't think it should be set in stone, you know, you hate a game or something to that extent. But you can look at a game uh that I haven't played or that I've put no time into and know if it's for me or not for me right based on like maybe just the uh genre it is. Right?

Is this do you just hate dealing with lag issues, or is it a consistent gameplay experience problem?

I'm about done with online gaming,\" even though I'm not entirely sure that's a reasonable thing to say given where the industry is and where it's going.

I believe that this was the best JRPG of that gen and was overlooked by most gamers even JRPG players. This leads to my question: what are games that you personally believe to be great but were heavily overlooked both at the time they came out and now? Love the show, keep up the good work. First thing that comes to my mind is Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze - that was the Wii U one, okay, the Wii one I don't think was overlooked, okay, I think people liked it a lot and I think that it got you know nice reviews and people overall saw that as a nice return to form for Donkey Kong and all this stuff because we got a couple weird ones in between with Donkey Kong 64 and all that stuff. So getting a nice 2D platform was great, even if people wanted Retro to be doing other things, whatever I enjoy that game a lot, Tropical Freeze.",

Sure, and I think even Donkey Kong Country 3 kind of uh missed out on that a bit. But I think that because this game was on Wii U and because it came out at the time that it did, it was by far the most overshadowed um Donkey Kong game in a long time. And even more than that, I think that Donkey Kong isn't necessarily one of Nintendo's like Heavy Hitters - so it's not Mario, it's not Zelda, it's not Metroid. So even for Nintendo users, I think it's overlooked. I think that's why I want to give that a shout out because I can talk about a whole bunch of other things but when a game is a Nintendo game that Nintendo people are overlooking, I think that's a problem.

And I know that they, I know that they patched it in to fix now, but when it came out it was insane. You could go literally make a sandwich, like I know people say that, but you could like literally just leave, walk in, take everything out, get the mayonnaise, put the bread on the plate, break up the lettuce, put on the meat, you know, like all and walk back, and it would still not be loaded.
