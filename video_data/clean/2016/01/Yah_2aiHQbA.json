I hope Croc and Boomerang have moments, you know what I mean. That's the one. I think when I look at the trailer and you're seeing it, I think you can see where Harley and Will Smith are like doing this thing, and then you're going to have these peaks that I hope are Boomerang with that beer in that one scene - like that's **** awesome what else he's going to do. That one is one of the moments that sold me, where I was like oh this is pretty cool. And I like they're tugging on the old heartstrings by using Queen. I don't know why I did that there on the old on the well we're all expecting like that was the moment that everyone's like all right shit's about to go down because we know the music, we know what happens there - everyone knows get the break and him just open up a **** beer",
