Yes sure mine's Metal Gear and there's no debate like there's literally nothing that I thought held a candle to it, and I mean and that's and that's always funny to say because I know I was looking at the chat when we were going like did any of them play Undertale? It's like no no we didn't you know what I mean and that's on my list of **** to play just like Life is Strange is but again Life is Strange and Undertale, the two that I'm like people keep recommending I'm like oh **** that actually does right but it's just one of those things you can't play everything you're drawn to what you're drawn to all these different things and like yeah like I kept waiting and thinking and you know I was like all\"",

Um, but yeah, having said that, for me, it is between Super Mario Maker and Metal Gear Solid. And I've been debating this in the shower a lot because I was like, \"I knew we were doing this show, and I was like, 'I don't know what I want to put out there if I had to choose one.'\" My thing is Super Mario Maker is everything I ever wanted - it's just unlimited Mario. Whether it's Mario 1, 3, World, or Super Mario Bros., and it's like that's crazy. Like I would have never thought we'd get that officially from Nintendo. Yeah, we get the ROM hacks and all that stuff, but like this is just unlimited Mario made by awesome people doing different things.

I went through all the missions, and I found you doing some side quests, and kind of just experimenting and fiddling with the equipment and all that kind of stuff, making new things.

Um, and you could really even end the conversation there; I would even consider something like Until Dawn, just based on the Resonance of the experience. Uh, and then you can talk a little bit about Mad Max or like you know whatever you want to talk about, but I really think it probably comes down to Rocket League. I, I, uh, Dying Light; I'm not comfortable. Um, we make our own rules right?
