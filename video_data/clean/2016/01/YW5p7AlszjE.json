Today is vexing Greg over there, that's the guy Tim Gettys. Let's talk about what's vexing you. I called an audible and I was like, \"You know what? I'm going to try to find some tickets to see Star Wars tonight with you fine gentlemen.\" Now I knew I'm not going to be able to go to your showing because it's all sold out. Time-out for those watching at home - this is we are recording this before this is the last thing we're going to record and then us three, Tim, Nick, and me will go to line up for Star Wars. We haven't seen Star Wars yet. Yeah, now the conundrum was that they're going to see the 3D showing and I don't want to see the 3D showing so I'm waiting till my friend to see some uh the showing tomorrow with my friends in 2D but I can't wait anymore so I've",

Yeah, I mean it, it's all good. What I really love more than anything is the fact that obviously Star Wars has taken over all of our lives, but more than that, the days leading up to the release of Star Wars we have made more content for this channel than we ever have in terms of shows that are coming out in the so for the next months are going to almost see Star Wars happen. It's very true, but this is your last chance to talk about it and like the feelings you're going through and your emotions right. So what is the current plan Nick for you?

I genuinely prefer fiction to non-fiction, but there's just something about a good documentary that fascinates me.

Always mad at me because I never want to watch fiction but I don't know who made all of them. Yeah, the issue is most of the documentaries that you've seen that are actual documentaries, sure you don't know who made them because it's not about that person's personal agenda. The most famous documentarian on the planet probably is Michael Moore, but he's not a... he's not making **** documentaries; he's making a statement with his films which is not necessarily I don't believe it's true documentary filmmaking.

And some could argue that's what filmmaking is used for. It's on Netflix definitely check it out, it's beautifully made too by the way because they do the dramatic reenactments that are beautifully filmed, they look like film, they look like a movie.
