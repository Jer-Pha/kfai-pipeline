We're playing That Dragon, Cancer, and this is a game I've been looking forward to for quite a while. I saw it at PAX a while back, uh, I think PS Prime and maybe E3 as well, wherever they were over in that Indie Mega Booth. I remember walking over and seeing... and of course, it automatically strikes a tone with me. If you know nothing about this game, it is, I've been told to expect a cry; it is incredibly sad, and it's about... and it's based on real life. This developer making a game about his son going through chemotherapy and fighting cancer, which of course hits a note for me being a Hodgkin lymphoma survivor, of course, a little over three years ago now. You guys got me through that in my six months of chemo, so I'm anxious to jump in... uh, you know if you know anything about KindaFunnyGames or anything about me, that I like the story.",
