So even for Nintendo users, I think it's overlooked. I think that's why I want to give that a shout out because I can talk about a whole bunch of other things, but when a game is a Nintendo game that Nintendo people are overlooking, I think that's a problem. Sure, I actually played that Donkey Kong game and this is a great example goes back to the first topic I only played it for an hour or so at IGN and I formed my opinion that too heavy, too much weight, didn't like it. Uh, yeah, Lost Odyssey definitely was overlooked. I mean there was a lot of early Xbox 360 games JRPG when Microsoft was making their kind of Japanese Gambit with uh Infinite Undiscovery and Blue Dragon and and a bunch of games that they shouldn't have stranded on Xbox 360 but that's their fault for making that deal with Microsoft.

Joe game that would have been awesome um it would have been awesome like I love Vanquish it's such a great game uh I think that there are a lot of overlooked um kind of digital products too but but um you know I even think like a lot of Housemarque games are overlooked uh like in terms of who's playing them I mean they have they have a great reputation in uh the PlayStation",

It's so much that is one of those games that if that comes out right now on PlayStation 4 as a new product, it's not going to get big, don't get me wrong, this isn't Insult Rocket League or anything like that, but it would blow up. Not that big, but it would get it would get big, there would be a thing, there would be DLC, there would be support, people would be behind it. Whereas this one came out and just languished, you know what I mean? But even when the PlayStation Network has its issues, like not enough people play Shatter, you know what I mean? Come on, Shatter was awesome. One of those games every time we talk about it, people are still like, \"Oh right, whatever that was cool,\" you know what I mean?

Um, even Wild Arms 2 - Wild Arms is a really beloved JRPG, as everyone knows I love it, but and a lot of people do, but what the sequel is really good as well. So there's all these um these Little Gems hidden in there. But as we know, like as games come out, like some things just get cast aside and we just don't get to play them. Um, and then the longer time goes on, the more these games just get buried, and you kind of have to rely on the opinions and the kind of the recommendations of others to go back or not go back and play some of these games. But I mean, I can write you a list of games. I mean, the most recent I think criminally super criminally overlooked game was probably was probably Spec Ops: The Line. Um, which I think is an amazing uh third-person shooter both mechanically and in terms of its story it's very geopolitical it's very um psychological and **** up uh as",

But I think that you know this this is a very uh subjective kind of question because I think that like what what do you base it on is you know sales or buzz visibility or buzz or whatever. I think that I mean I think that it's just as easy to talk about games, you know there are games I definitely think too many people played so it's um yeah so I think the question obviously goes both ways but those are the ones that kind of yeah the question's hard too because like what's the difference between overlooked or underrated and all that stuff.

Am I'm definitely saying I bet the load times were better. It's great, I mean that game was super awesome, and to say it's overlooked, I'm not exactly making a true statement because people really liked and sold well and reviewed well and all that stuff. But I think it's overlooked when people look back on that generation and think cart racing everyone jumps to Mario 64 and the memories they had with that, and I have memories of that too for sure. But Crash even then I was like this is better; now I'm a Crash fanboy, but of course the game is good, the game's really good, and the Power-Up system is good, and the power slide system and all that stuff is really good, really good, and um yeah Sleeping",

Yeah, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning was so underrated; two if only they gave it the high praise it deserved. So pretty much calling any game good on IGN is like looking at games calling God; Amer was so good. Jesus Christ, now you got me thinking about that. I was also going to say in line with your crash one, one that will be dismissed just because I'm Greg Miller, but Ghostbusters the video game had no business being as good as it was. That's actually a really good point; development hell had all the voices, had a fun story, you know, bit you know, walk some very similar territory, but it was fun, and like they actually made being a Ghostbuster for like eight hours or whatever interesting.

I mean that was a very interesting time, just in terms of licensed games where they for a year or two around there they stopped doing just cashing cashing garbage right and you know we got Spider-Man 2 and we got a couple like good ones early on but like there was Batman: The Arkham Games, there was the Transformers Cybertron Games and then there was um Ghostbusters. And I was like holy **** this is like a turning point and now Batman obviously is what it is now but the I think the Transformers games are overlooked too cuz those were I never thought I'd get a Transformers game that good that was good yeah and it was awesome, it was really awesome, really faithful and especially after the movies I expected it to be movie **** it wasn't it was great and I",

I also want to give a shout out to again, not necessarily overlooked, but this game sold very well with it, but they're not games no, they weren't developed by Nintendo, and people don't talk about them when they talk about you know Link's Awakening comes up a lot, which I actually is like one of my least favorite Zelda games, um as like the the the Pinnacle of handheld Zelda, and then obviously um you know to a lesser extent Minish Cap or The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap, than you know the ones on DS, which I also didn't like at all.
