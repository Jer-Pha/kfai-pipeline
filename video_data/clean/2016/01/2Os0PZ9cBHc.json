They've had some great moments with Hot Pepper Gaming content on Kinda Funny.

I they just need to get over themselves and that there's been two trailers, yeah, period. My it used to be in at least in my brain, and I could be wrong about this, but it used to be like a teaser was like 30 seconds, yeah, and a trailer was like a full one-minute to two-minute long trailer. I mean, but now it's like you get a trailer that drops a teaser that drops; it's 5 and a half minutes, and you're like, \"It's just a teaser, man.\" It's not a trailer until we tell you it's a trailer.
