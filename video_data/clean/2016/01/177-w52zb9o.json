Thomas first appeared in 1946, really, in the second book in the series, \"Thomas the Tank Engine,\" because I remember just the cartoon. Yeah, so there were books. Yeah, so definitely not before my time. I didn't fight in World War II, believe it or not. This is very interesting. I'm reading... There's too much to read. You're annoying me. Give me give me give give me an iPad. I think read it was he just \"thic\" the was he in 1913? Was he Thomas the steam engine, meaning that \"The Little Engine That Could\" ripped off Thomas the Tank Engine and we were totally wrong and who ripped off whom? Okay, wait a minute. The all I don't care about any of that. The only thing I care about is the TV series. Thomas's on-screen appearances in the TV series were developed by Britt Allcroft.

Jason says that might have changed; the source said, \"There are talks about making a trilogy of the same character, so they might explore Greece or Rome next.\" Greece, Rome next. In the breaks on Assassin's Creed screen, I don't think it's a bad idea, like we've talked about before, right? Like I think Syndicate is a fun game; Syndicate is a good game. Syndicate had no buzz and I never heard anyone talk about it before during or after you know what I mean. It's one of those where the people who reviewed it, like when Alex put up her review, I was like, \"Is it good?\" She's like, \"Yeah, you should play.\" I'm like, \"All right,\" and I eventually played; I was like, \"Oh, this was good too bad no one played it\" and I assume.",

High score chasing a lot of trophies - it's a platinum trophy you can get, which I got. So, I want to recommend Infamous: First Light. It should be pretty cheap by this point; you'd have to assume that, yeah. Um, you don't need Infamous 2 on the PS3; it's standalone, just like the Infamous 2 DLC was. So, go check it out, let us know what you think - there's a story there, but it's the arena combat that I think is quite addictive; it's a good weekend game, yes. 100% correct. Uh, this week's PSN worst name of the week comes from Brown, who wrote in Toofunny.com forums and said my buddy recently got a PS4, and so when I approached him about exchanging PSN IDs, he started to grin apparently he made his account years ago on his friend's PS3 using his own email address but his friend chose the",

He told me I should submit a song so I wrote a bunch of songs in the 88 days leading up to Fallout 4 - one song A Day, 88 songs total, all about Fallout. I am a glutton for punishment. Here's the first song off that batch; it's called 'I'd Blow Up the World for You.' My wife sings on it and my neighbor played the upright bass. Listen to it! First off, I like a good concept album if this counts - 88 days leading up to Fallout, why not? That's cool. Song's fun, it's very something you hear in Fallout so ladies and gentlemen this is New Cool Now Music, it's been our pleasure to serve you am\"",
