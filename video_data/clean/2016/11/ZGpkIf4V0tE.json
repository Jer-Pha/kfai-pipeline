Yes, now it sounds completely absurd because it is, and when you watch it they did things like um light themselves on fire with gasoline and almost burn the house down um a couple times actually cuz I had to re-shoot that scene because they were kids and they left the letter on the camera remember when you used to do that oh that's like you didn't realize that the A was getting constantly burned in so",

It does just enjoy it while it lasts. Yeah, it's a beautiful ride. My argument would be just for this one thing, and because I have no attachment to Star Wars, right.

Do I believe it? Have you seen no, not even a little. Does Corey already ever believe the facts presented to him? No, no, not typically. So, so it's one of those things where I feel like I'm just concerned that there aren't new and better ideas.

Like, and I like that kind of thing where I'm like, 'Huh,' like restraint is something we don't see very often in the arts anymore because now it's like, 'Well, how can I run this thing into the ground? How many times can we remake this thing?' Now Indiana Jones is coming back; we're getting a Star Wars movie where they have to use Han and Lando. We're getting all... I'm like, come on guys, like aren't there new ideas? And so I think it goes all the way back to this particular thing where why don't we get inspired by what we like well here's my thing and then use that to create something new.

The Twilight Zone was very important to me as a kid, uh, as a writer and a reader, and in the Sci-Fi genre, and all these things like that show is phenomenal; it stands up to this day and is better than virtually everything that's come since in terms of storytelling. And to see Black Mirror, I heard people talking about Black Mirror where they're like, \"It's kind of like this British thing,\" and it's kind of like The Twilight Zone, all these things. No, it is The Twilight Zone, and no one's stopped and said that to me or I would have actually watched it earlier.
