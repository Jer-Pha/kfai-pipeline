But I hope that that's what they do. We'll see. That's another game like Titanfall that's desperate in desperate need of a single-player campaign and suffered because of it. I think with some people even though it sold very well, I think it'd be a great idea to do that. We're going to get you know Respawn Star Wars. We're going to get um the millions of Star Wars games. Time out. I've lost sight of this. And what do we know? What Respawn's Star Wars game is going to be? Is it a first-person shooter or whatever they showed a like guy doing motion capture? Okay, I forget. Yeah, it's just coming. They imply that it's an action game. I thought it was third-person third-person action game. Okay.

Of course, the flip to that is that you can jump online and download other people's creations and like, you know, it's like LittleBigPlanet or Mod Nation Racers where you put in all this time here's something go get but then you lose that thing where it is fun to create your own character and it is fun to feel like you're creating something from the ground up. But when it's just too much and I can't at all deal with it, I'm like, oh man, **** this.

I enjoyed the like being able to change your outfits and looking forward to customizing my character to be how I wanted them to look because it was part of the game. Um, so I think that's the difference to me is like I don't want to just from the beginning of you know choose a whole bunch of options that don't affect anything; it doesn't make me feel more connected to the character; it just feels like I'm doing stuff just because it's a video game.
