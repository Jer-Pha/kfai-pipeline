I don't know where I wrote it but it's it's doesn't even really feel like Call of Duty why is it so interesting?

I don't think people are looking at this the way they looked at Assassin's Creed - I think that it's actually been one of those games that we kept forgetting about, what are the big games coming out of Gears and Call of Duty, and then somebody be like, \"Oh, Watch Dogs,\" oh yeah, watch, I should why haven't we seen what's going on with that?

Oh no, that in that world this or this world it's fine it's just that's not how I'm playing it so like I think a good example of it right is like I went there I scoped out this entire area right I bopped around the security cams I set some traps and then I you know went up and dropped the not the drone, the robot car guy cuz that's all I have right now and I drove that around right and when it was I done I got in there I hacked the thing I needed and he can pick stuff up so if you're collecting something the little guy picks it up and then I you know hit the button to come back and what for me defines the character so far is he's sitting there Indian-style on his laptop, you know I mean like that's",
