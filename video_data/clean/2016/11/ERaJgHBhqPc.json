I run around doing all the side stuff I'm just collecting non-stop because it's just one of those things that I'm doing so well at getting the research points and unlocking the new things on my trees why even bother playing the game until I've done all of that until I've gotten every paint job until I've gotten every piece of clothing until I've gotten every research point.

But I get there and I get the little message: \"Come back later.\" Like the zombies come back later; like the people getting married come back later. And I'm like, I appreciate this to an extent, but I don't appreciate the fact that I've come back multiple times to these locations and they're timed. Yeah, I need... and I don't want to...

So the Alola forms - uh, it's you're still getting Vulpix, but now it's Ice-type instead of Fire or whatever, so it's like those types of things are nice. But in addition to that, the game even from early on switches up what you'd expect. So everybody that's played Pok\u00e9mon knows that you get the Pidgeys and Rattatas early on in this game. You can catch Ghost-types, you can catch Water-types, Fire-types in the second area of the game, and I'm like holy **** they're really opening this up to be a different type of experience, um, while still giving us the old nice mix of new and old so that it never felt overwhelming with new like clones but it also didn't feel like great, it's just the same thing over and over that we're",

So in Smash Brothers, there's the smash ball, and you can unleash a super move. In this game, when you use the Z-move, you can use it once per battle. And once you get it from the trial challenges, you can use all the fire-type Z-powers or all the normal-type Z-powers, and you kind of go that way. It's another new addition where it's like totally unnecessary, makes the game kind of easy because whenever you're having a troublesome battle, you can always pull out your Z-move, and it does a lot of damage. Um, um, but it was fun to use, and it kind of mixes like Power Ranger elements into Pok\u00e9mon in a way that I really enjoy. I'm sure you do, I'm sure you do.

Yes, Nintendo Switch wholesale price to retailers is 200 lb yes so I don't understand how that equates to $250. I don't understand how people are doing that math. Wholesale means that's the price in which they're buying massive amounts of consoles at one time; they're not going to then turn them around for no profit, so I don't understand. I'm just a little confused about how people got from point A to point B on that. So that's where I'm a little confused from what you were reading.
