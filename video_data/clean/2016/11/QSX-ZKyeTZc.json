            "text": "Bonjourno Kinda Funny fan, it's me Greg Miller and I'm in front of a GameStop - not for real but kind of in the screen thing uh we had a cool opportunity Tim somehow talked to GameStop and they said \"Hey, would you like to put videos in GameStops and do like content and make little videos for us\" and we were like \"Sure, is there any money?\" and they're like \"No, this is just you doing some cool content\" so we made these videos for GameStop to run in GameStop stores which is kind of a big deal. I'm working out of a really cool studio in San Francisco, so rather than just put them there and have you never see them, we thought we'd put them here. But I need to put a bump in front of it because I say a lot of stuff about GameStop in there - but if you're just on YouTube, you're like \"I don't, I don't care about that\". So you're about to watch a video that airs in GameStop - if you ever see it in a GameStop, you need to take a selfie of yourself with it playing.",

Will this tortured game about a bird dog cat thing and its boy tug at our heartstrings or be a gigantic waste of our time in PlayStation's money? Find out on December 6th, or now if you're watching it after December 6th. I hate when you see videos like this and they're talking about release dates and the release dates already passed; they said coming soon. So if you're in the future, hello future - how did the election turn out? Next up is Overcooked. Yep, I'm putting a goofy little game from the PlayStation Network on here, so grab yourself a PSN card before you leave the store. You see, for a long time old gamers like me have been complaining about the death of couch co-op; you know, playing next to a friend sitting on the same couch as you.",

You know, playing next to a friend sitting on the same couch as you, right there, besides doing local kind of multiplayer stuff. Well, Overcooked brings that back by challenging you and a pal to chop veggies, cook burgers, and be the fastest short-order cooks around. On top of that, Overcooked gives you some really strict time restraints that'll have you screaming at your bestie in no time. But this is a good thing, I swear. Now here's where I cheat and say Batman \u2013 you say which Batman game, and I say all of them. Seriously, 2016 has been a great year for the Dark Knight. You can get your combo meter as high as possible in The Amazing Spider-Man isn't mentioned, so I assume it's \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" is incorrect here - it should be \"The Amazing Batman: Arkham Asylum\" and Arkham City via Batman: Return to Arkham. You can make choices that drastically changed the Bruce Wayne mythos in Batman: The Telltale series or you can become the bat in Batman: Arkham VR, whether it's action, story, or",

Whether it's an action story or immersion, Batman's got you covered. Now let's toss in an odd little mashup here. Okay, let's talk about Dragon Quest Builders. Here Square Enix is taking the beloved RPG world of Dragon Quest and mashing it up with the mechanics of Minecraft. What we get here is an adorable builder that isn't super challenging but is super endearing. You create towns, take quests, and even double back for challenges when your adventure takes you to a brand new space. And how could I, Greg Miller, talk about PlayStation in 2016 and not mention Uncharted: The Thief's End? Simply put, developer Naughty Dog has delivered another classic here. We end Nathan Drake's story in an epic adventure that sees Sully, Nate, and even a long-lost brother chase a pirate treasure and their past. The game's beautiful; the action is fierce and",
