So I want to go through the nominees and kind of give our predictions for what we think are gonna win. The Game Awards, sure? So this is not necessarily what we want to win, some predictions for what will win. Okay, do we want to decide what we want to win? We can do that too. Okay, because I think we have to vote on these eventually, right? We nominated them, that's the pool. Oh yeah, and now we should actually vote. I won't read it, that's not a secret ballot initiative where we go \"I'm not you know Jeff hasn't said hey you got to go into this booth here and punch the ticket.\" I guess you're right, we should probably do that now. I'm gonna be okay, cool. Yeah, so for you guys that are interested, the nomination process was pretty simple: each category we got to nominate five different games or people or whatever, and we made a spreadsheet.

I loved Firewatch; I loved its story, but it's not the best. Um, between Inside and Uncharted for me, Uncharted I'd say is my favorite of it, but I'm gonna give it to Inside.

I think it's another situation where some people are going to be voting so much for Inside in other categories that they'd get here and go \"Firewall\" right? One hmm yeah yeah. I think it's between Inside and Uncharted. So we talked about art direction, and all that is why I mean Uncharted is a masterpiece in terms of the way it looks.

Like what do you do with Pok\u00e9mon Go? Yeah, it was an experience, a movement. It was everywhere; normal people were out there playing games, talking about him playing in the middle of the night, wandering around doing gym battles interacting with strangers like there were these things.
