He used like improvised explosives and, uh, you know, you just went to some different paths, kind of luring them in using molotovs, very similar kind of attacks you saw with his submachine gun and all those kinds of things. Uh, the interesting thing that he was talking about was we see the camp at dusk so the Freakers hibernate during the day; they won't come out during the day, okay? And uh, he was saying that if you get there during the day, you know, you have to do this particular quest. You can actually totally set traps and improvise explosives and all sorts of stuff, and then run the Freakers like through these areas that you've already lined up. In other words, you can like wait at night and stay safe and be patient, and then get in there during the day, and then get out of there before dusk, and let them come out; then run through, and they'll chase you. So he talked about how what the setup is like; the rumor always been that it",

The interesting thing that he said was that no urban environments, this really is based in like Central and Eastern Oregon, there's not a lot going on over there so you might get some outcasts, some villages or something like that, no big cities, not like you know um not like Portland or anything like that. So um there is that they talked a little bit about the quest structure not too much I mean in terms of like you are going to be questing",
