We'll go through Endo Treehouse. I assume we're all on the page. PlayStation, yes, yeah, I think it's pretty clear. Yeah, that said, this is what I said yesterday. Yeah, Microsoft can't catch a break. Yeah, right. The example I used was Xbox One selling very well; PS4 is selling meteorically, so no one cares that Xbox One is selling very well.",

No I think it's cool I think it's cool that it gives it gives people for him to be in that position it allows other people to one day be in that position you know you got to create it and you gotta like be hyped about stuff and be excited on stuff or else no one else will be and putting the spotlight on the game creator as well like yeah you know I think Sean did a great job of emceeing the event, yeah but having creators out there and spotlighting them and thriving I think that's great, yeah it flies in the face of what you were saying about some of our shows about how you don't want games getting announcements are not within an 18-month\"",

One of them could slip, but I think... but I think in terms of managing the portfolio, it tells me that they don't want to put dates on anything because of what happens sure when you do that - and it happened with Uncharted, and it happened with Horizon Zero Dawn, it happens with almost everything they announced. The Last Guardian, wait, happy seeing a date on that was a really huge deal. But I think the intent behind what they're doing is in their internal portfolio, they'll see how everything shakes out - like they're probably aiming for '17 for those three games and if two of them hit which I think they will, I think you can see Days Gone first half, God of War second half, you know.",

I will say though that there was I've been talking to people about this, and the more I think about the Sony conference, the more I think it's true that Neo was probably at the end. Yeah, and they showing Days Gone there was just weird when he was kind of like an ellipsis (...) and weird as an end cap to the entire conference. Interesting, yes, because they could have shown a trailer and in-game play back-to-back, which I've done before, yeah. Dan is the rest of the presser, no, and they... and so they put that at the end, which I think was interesting.

Nothing so like I feel like I feel like with Scorpio they might be eyeing like a Aaron Greenberg told us a generation list kind of approach to gaming and Sony is having is taking a more iterative approach without being modular with a machine that's not that much powerful and they're selling it as being like well don't worry about it's not that much more powerful and that's not going to sell consoles. That's why I think Sony is up, and that's why I think Scorpio seems like it's more on the right path but what's really interesting to me is that you know I don't know the exact leaked specs of the the PS4 Neo but the Xbox One S is more powerful has the 4K stuff and it has the HDR and listen to that it sounds like those are even more comfortable",

It's going to be no prove it because I bought the Xbox One and I turn it on once every six months to play an exclusive or whatever. And granted, it's a luxury; it could be different, but right now it is the same thing of like, \"Well, I need to see what this does\" before I care. Well, I think Project Scorpio is them starting to prove it, but like Holland said, you know they're seating that sort of PS4 Xbox One yeah battle. They're like uh, you know what? What we really want your eyes on is the future when we're gonna be the Big Boss Hogg's on the scene. Yeah now Tim mm-hmm why was EA a disappointment we've talked about it instead of what they want this is better because but what",

I hate to tell you if you think you're gonna play that game you know the next calendar year, I would, I would be confused unless their approach is gonna be more like Bethesda's with Fallout 4 where it's like in June the game exists and in November here it is you play it but they already let the cat out of the bag that's right but that's so good and what they I what they do and why they actually showed a lot of restraint except for the fact that they",

Right, as the first thing they did was to tease that Wolfenstein game - a few folks didn't see it; it was a DOS prompt right there, says The New Colossus was after you know The Old Blood and The New Order; both had release dates, but The New Colossus did not, so there's another Wolfy time. Spellman, it way, but that's awesome. She began how you do press conferences? You put those little things in there, you have those moments of \"oh, you watch the press conference, you think it's cool, and then afterwards you're like 'but I missed this'\". That's awesome, man.

Tough to have yet you got a lot of games to show; you want to do you're like it's the 30 years of the company, fam. I thought that there's a lot of earnestness and a lot of personality - I think I you should trim the fat kind of thing there, you know? Like The Division is your best-selling New IP ever, but do you need that much on it, you know? I mean, I think trimming that up would have gone a long way.
