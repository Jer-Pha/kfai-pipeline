I think I'm okay I'm read some summaries the problem with with Kingdom Hearts is it's it's so Vast at this point there's so much going on that I'm super confused and it's like that's not really their fault except it's entirely their um I'm not sure anyone knows exactly what's going on in this trailer but I'm happy that you know hopefully somebody somebody does so here Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep okay is the earliest in the the timeline so far that of these games that have been released that was a PlayStation Portable game PSP back in the day right this came out",

I saw that point-point-the digit eight, is it a digit? Kevin can I get a ruling on this, that's the digit eight, Roman numeral me, it's the number eight, yeah, that would be \"VIII\". What you call that, sure, yeah, that's an 8 or an infinity sign, no, but like what, what is that called if this is a Roman numeral, what's this? What's what's it's the Standard Arabic, yeah. We got so we got an Arabic eight, so that's cool. Then the most exciting part of this whole trailer, all jokes aside, BAM! December 2016 worldwide, so we're getting this this year, so we're going to get a taste of what Kingdom Hearts III might actually play like for me via Birth by Sleep. What is new in this?
