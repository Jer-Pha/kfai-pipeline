It's got all the hair on it, and it's disgusting. Those dogs suck; these dogs suck. But her friend had had one, so that's how this had started. So then I immediately started panicking and looking around the room, and I saw the Boston Terrier. I'm like, \"This is an American dog.\" If I have to get a dog today, can we at least get an American dog? We started arguing about that of course. This marriage didn't work out; arguing about this whatever. And then finally some lady brought in Portillo and put him down. I was like, \"Is that a Wiener Dog?\" And she's like, \"Yes.\" And I turned to the ex and said, \"If you let me get this wiener dog, and you name we name it Portillo, I'm in. I won't complain; I'll help out no big deal.\" And it was like okay. And I was in love with this Wiener Dog all of a sudden. It makes sense. Now here we are 11 years later.",
