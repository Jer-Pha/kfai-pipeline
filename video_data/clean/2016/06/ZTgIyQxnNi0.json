Uh, dancers can you guys bring it in behind you for a second? Just gather around, get behind me here. It's a special year, and uh I want to FFF to do something that's going to feel a little uh incongruous and potentially even uncomfortable for some of you.

Uh, it gets drunk on weekdays and dresses inappropriately, but whatever makes it feel young. Now over these three decades Ubisoft has been flexing its creative muscles giving its teams the freedom to push boundaries and create games that are memorable fun and sometimes a little crazy. So enough talk we're going to hit fast forward right now and get straight to the games.

The coca leaf is core to the culture; it's found in every gas station, every hospital, and every town square. And they use it for a variety of things like treating nausea and altitude sickness to a refreshing energy drink. But it can also be used to make cocaine. So we asked, what if? What if so funny took over the entire country, seized all those coca resources to become the number one producer of cocaine on the planet, effectively turning Bolivia into a narco state.

I love Ubisoft has kind of gotten so lazy that they just look out the window now and they're like let's just make the game here, just make it wherever we are, and living life to the fullest, and sometimes it's just about capturing those memorable moments and sharing them with your friends. Let's show some gameplay. Take it away, Yannis. Thank you.",

We developed a really cool observer tool, we call it Mountain View. Mountain View allows you to zoom out from your position, observe the world, and navigate into the environment. Our mountain range will be populated by drop zones - drop zones are entry points for you to drop in the world when you're ready. Now let's get back to our initial position. Besides drop zones, the game will offer a wide range of challenges for you to assess your skills. The one in front of us is a Wings activity, and as the other player drops in, we'll follow him and trigger a challenge - this is a proximity flying race challenge. It's like the way they salvage it - it's loosely based on Point Break. You're like, \"all right then, this all makes sense.\" Oh, that guy was symbolic of this press conference.

But we'd like to introduce you to another region, so let's switch to Mountain View and head over to Arvi (Arvi is likely a reference to the Arvi Valley in the game) the purpose of his presence was to show you what it's like to play online with your friends or with other players from the community. What's weird about it is it's like it strikes me as a tech demo you would put out, and granted I mean we're still learning about it, whatever. But it's just such an idea... like here's a wing suit challenge, here's a snowboard challenge, here's a ski challenge. Extreme sports in the Alps. You noticed the game on report GoPro views, GoPro views. I mean it's just so weird because it really reminds me of the SSX game that came out a couple years ago on PS3 with the wing suit and with all the different things like this but that game",
