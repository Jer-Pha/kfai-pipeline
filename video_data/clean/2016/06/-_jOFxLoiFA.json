If you're just joining us, Tim that topic is gonna be headlined \"Tim Gettys Is Useless\" and dying a good one. All right, my topic is in the vein of this, and we're going to get to Arrow, but it's going to start with I've broken up with Game of Thrones. When I broke up with Christine, I didn't realize it at the time I was breaking up with Game of Thrones too, cuz she was the motivator. I watched Game of Thrones because she wanted to watch Game of Thrones, and I was always like \"this is fine.\" But then the show would end, and she'd be like \"oh, that's different than the book,\" and I'd say \"what happened in the book?\" And she'd tell me what happened in the book. I was like \"what happens next?\" She'd be like \"no, no... Tyrion went and did this.\" I'm like \"which one's Tyrion?\" And she's like \"it's this one,\" and I'm like \"is he the small guy or the really big guy? I don't know. Like, who are they? Is he the little person?\"",

That is true, but we're thinking, don't have Dickon Greyjoy doesn't have a dick, we don't know if the UN has dicks or not, have balls - who's oh, they don't got no dicks. The woman that likes fire, Melisandre, but she can't get burned by fire, Daenerys can't get burned but I don't like that about Daenerys, the Red Witch lady, yeah, Manderly, she's so Daenerys pissed me off a lot because it was literally like Dutch, Kesi, Daenerys, Danny - there's all these names and people you use them interchangeably, so I have no idea for a while I had no idea who you're talking about. We're getting off track, Cersei was the motivator to go watch this show, I was fine with it, who is Kesi? She's Daenerys, no, Kesi is a title she owns that title, I believe",

Kesi is a title she owns, it's not a person's name. I so it came around this season it was time to for Game of Thrones to come on and I just never ever was motivated or cared about watching and then every Sunday night people are freaking out on Twitter and with the Hodor stuff no spoilers I was like what I I liked Hodor fun what happened to him and I just went and read George R. R. Martin's recap I was like that sounds interesting but it took me 3 minutes to read it here rather than the 30 minutes to watch the show that may or may not be real careful about you know making sure everyone knows that I could understand if you were to say you were going to break up I mean I'm assuming\"",

See, I think that's part of it: I stumbled along with last season; last season was a lot of setup and in my opinion, probably the worst season of all of the entire show up to this point. This season, because they're sort of racing to the end now, a lot of stuff is moving a lot faster, and we're getting a lot of answers - things so unlike um like they're not doing the thing that I hoped they wouldn't do, which is the Lost ending where they're like \"oh s***\" we have to scramble and answer a bunch of stuff very quickly. Now there's they're not setting anything up anymore; now it's it's with the exception of a small characters here and there but now now it's sort of like let's let's start having",

It's so well thought out, all of it. And it's like when you start talking about it, like, \"All right, there's zombies, and there's... um, yeah.\" Don't even get started on the Night King, but you bring in all these other elements. Season one, they're coming; oh, they're still coming; oh, they're coming. All we see is one; they're coming **** get there; they're coming. And that's the end. No, you had your chance. You had your chance. The Night King will come at the end, and that's the whole point. And I like that they are giving us these little things throughout the seasons. There's so many characters and so many plots; they're jumping back and forth. You get all the... those... the... Buddy systems where it's like, \"Who the **** thought Hound\"",

And then I tried to start Legends of Tomorrow, and I was like, \"You know what? No, I'm good.\" Yeah, I mean, I think that's systemic of an issue that network and cable television is having in general, like HBO \u2013 I don't count them as cable television; I count them as a premium network. Um, they're giving you something different, and in this regard, I think Tim's right: like it's you should come back to it because I think you're going to see a story unfold at the end of all this that is truly unique and awesome and of such a scale that we probably won't ever see that again.
