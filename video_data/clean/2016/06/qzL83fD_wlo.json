I'm talking this You can't see the end of them. Well, Jesus Christ. I mean, that's that's obviously scarier. Cats are scary. I mean, even one cat's like kind of I don't trust him, you know? But they're wild cats, but you don't know if they're going to attack you or not. Whereas the mountain lion, I feel like you is you see the mountain lion, he's he's he smelled you about six miles out and has been stalking you ever since. So, he's coming after you. You're going to have to fight the mountain lion. Whereas the cats might just carry you home. You know what I mean? They might crowd surf you home like Tim does every night. I'm into that.

I would rather encounter the ferel cats cuz I have a fighting chance. I don't think I have a fight cuz like you're saying how big was the mountain lion again? I'm saying it's medium size. What does that mean? I'll say it's roughly three times the size of Portal. Oh, wait. So that's like a small 'cause mountain lions aren't huge. Maybe I'm talking like maybe the ferel cats are big.

Pre-new 52 Superman era, right? And it was when Red Kryptonite made its debut in that, of course, this is post Crisis, so we knew of Red Kryptonite beforehand, but this is the first time when Superman didn't have his powers and had to ride the subway. There was a giant rat. If I'm alive, I'm dying. There was this giant rat. And what Clark Kent did was, of course, being a hero, he knew he had to stop it.

And then we are going to have to climb over you or run around you and just start punching. I mean, I'm probably not going to be that guy. But like what if what if we each grabbed one of his legs and tried to just draw and quarter him. I'm going to tell you this.

You can lose one or two party members, but you want to make sure that you're doing enough damage to justify the loss of the party members so you don't have any Phoenix downs, no elixir. So if I can do just even 10 or 15% damage to this thing before it's gone, then that could be an advantage to you guys. You only have to deal with 85% of the mountain lion's health with three of you left, you know, and then say another person falls at 60% and it's a somewhat wounded mountain lion with two of you left at full health.
