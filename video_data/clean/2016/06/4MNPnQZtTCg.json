Jord, thank you so much for coming, and thank you so much for drinking all of our beer because someone has to. We can't fly back with it. Um, Greg, can we fly back with beer? He brought the beer; he brought the beer, brought the beer. Holy cannoli! I'm filling up your fridge again. Thank you so much for letting me drink all your... no problem, cuz I'm going to do that later. Absolutely. Um, so you guys were at the Microsoft conference correct? This game looks incredibly cool and weird, and I want to get right into it. So, you preface it however you need to. Preface with sure. Well, the premise of the game is... yeah, is that the Earth's resources are nearly depleted. Okay, so we at NASA send a rogue astronaut to the Moon to save Humanity.",

Okay, cool, so lucky for you I know exactly how to go as fast as possible. Good, we do not have to go fast. Fair enough, but if we go any longer than 5 minutes, we have to drink a beer for every five minutes. I kind of love that. I might take my time though. All right, get my bearings here. Yes, so basically I'm going to find everything here. These generators right here, boom, lights on now we have this part of the station working. We have to get there; they are all four sections up. Gotcha! That I have to admit that does kind of look like a penis. Which part? That part right there where it's like you knew it immediately as well. I mean, I've seen a lot of uncut dicks in my life. Fair enough, who hasn't? Is true. We're going to refill a little glad there's more people here watching this not that what's up.

Oh yeah, 100% has our favorite connotations so what? So this is the Hub base that we're in right now exactly. So now what we're going to do is we have to get our power tool - it's essentially a key but it's also going to get different mechanics when this game progresses. So we've already set up that it could be a laser cutter or a welder and also uh, when you put it on your back, it turns into a jetpack. Unfortunately I don't have that in the demo any of those things - it's just a key. I believe you, though, and I look forward to it. Cheers, we're gonna go wake it up right now. Lucky I played this a million times already today so do we know why all the bases were abandoned? We're working on\"",

Okay, uh, we were really lucky to get chosen by Microsoft. That dude, well, it looks dope. We got in the trailer for ID at Xbox, and when we saw our name up there, we freaking... bugged the... out, man. Seriously, we freaked the... out. It was pretty cool, man. I mean, it just is very cool aesthetic. I can appreciate why people... it's it's yeah, I saw, I'm like that looks fascinating. Thank you, man. We're uh working real hard on it. See, like this uh is essentially our game where people love to shoot. There's not a lot of enemies in our game right now.
