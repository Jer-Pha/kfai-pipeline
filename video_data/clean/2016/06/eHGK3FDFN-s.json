The main character Aloy um seems to have at least a somewhat diverse arsenal. I like that she's like riding a mount. These enemy designs are amazing. Like, it's just such a cool like the game kind of has a what was the game last gen uh Enslaved obviously to the West yes exactly it kind of has that vibe to it but the the enemies and the the I guess not enemies the with the machine all that stuff too like all of the the creatures have such a a cool unique look to them that uh really sets it apart. It's a really unique it seems like, I mean who knows what I was going to talk about it seems like a unique story unique take that's awesome yeah and he's a guy I mean the enemies and this is what I like this is very Killzone-esque um a lot of these enemies remind me of of at least with their orange eyes and stuff some of them have Hella machines other of them look",

Some of them have Hellish machines, others look totally exotic and like things you've never seen before. I mean, this game's been in development for a long time, Greg, and I got to this game a long time ago, like I would say five years ago; um, and uh, we didn't know what it was yet, but the word was that they were working on an open-world role-playing game. And they hired writers and a team to be able to do that concurrent with making Shadow of the Colossus, which was a PS4 launch game, and I'm sure that they're probably making another Killzone game as well; um, but I'm excited about this because it's a different look, it's definitely looking like I like. I like that uh you're right, the creatures do look kind of Killzone-esque, but combined in this world, it's a nice clash that I think really has a nice visual aesthetic to the whole thing and all the",
