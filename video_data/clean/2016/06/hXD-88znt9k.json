Giant number of people, giant number of players here. They said on their blog post today it's four people, so you're it's a four-player co-op. Yeah, I have a million questions about this. They said it's drop-in, drop-out, so I'm guessing then that I have my own game world, I'm doing my own quest and then you can come drop in help out. I'm sure they're not going to screw this up where Tim Gettys' XP and has a great time and then jumps back to his world and has that XP and all the things he's gathered and stuff.

In terms of this like Super HD Xbox One PC edition, and so when you talk about a team that big taking on an idea that large - different settlements, different people - that's enough to make me step back and go \"hm\". But four people, I'm down with, I think they can do that. I assume it will be okay. I'm going to go on a supply run. Did you ever play State of Decay? Okay, I forget. No, fuu up. Jesus Christ. Him so like this would be one of those things where we know there's a mission out here or maybe from somewhere else we've targeted put it on our map and so I could send out the three of you to go to that place meanwhile I'm going to sit back and home watch camp see what's up and then while you're there can I do that?
