First and foremost, I got it. Z-win, can I invert my control? Oh, yeah, I got a mouse invert. Sorry guys, every time let's play, I'm old school that way, always, always a pain in the ass. Thank you so much right two one here we go. Whoa, too bad you to die. Oh God, oh God, this... oh hey look our Smiley. So right off the bat, this is a little bit weird.
