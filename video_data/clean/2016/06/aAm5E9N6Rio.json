Subscribe now at youtube.com/kindafunnygames to not miss a thing. What's up guys, I'm Tim Gettys, this is Greg Miller. Hi, we're looking at Zelda. You finally got to go see The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Oh, it has a name. Oh, Breath of the Wild. Yeah, I didn't know that. They were going to announce today or yesterday, today during The Treehouse thing. I've been doing videos and stuff. Everyone thought it was just The Legend of Zelda. Yeah, everyone thought there was going to be a female Link. No, but everybody thought it was going to be really open and like Skyrim, asking all that stuff. One out of three of those things correct. It is very open. No female Link. Okay, does have a subtitle Breath of the Wild, and there's a reason for that, Greg. The reason is I got the breath. There's a bunch of animals in this game, a whole bunch of animals. So what we did is I got to play this game, yeah, and it's awesome. Let me just start, let me",

So what we did is I got to play this game, yeah, and it's awesome. Let me just start, let me start you there, Greg. I was a little hesitant; I saw the trailer and I wasn't sold really. I mean, it was Zelda; it looks amazing. Zelda looks awesome, so okay, sold might not be the right word. I was definitely sold; I was not highly impressed. I was not \"wow,\" your interest was peaked but your appetite not. I don't know where I'm going with that something there, something there, but it's just like it. I was like all right, cool Zelda trailer. You know, it gave me the same feelings that the Skyward Sword trailer gave; not to say anything bad, but just like okay, cool more Zelda. Playing it, seeing this really kind of extended look at it much much better. So it's very open here. We played for about 40 minutes, so I'm just going to kind of skim through and try show you the highlights here. So yeah, this game there's a lot of",

That's the thing there, there's there's a lot of different systems in play here now Audio Waves, the little purple thing in the in the bottom right of the HUD that is so that you know how loud you're being so that you can sneak up on enemies or animals to hunt them and that type of stuff. Above that, there's a little temperature gauge so things get cold or hot depending on the weather and that affects your health if it's too cold you start losing your life sounds like Snake Eater yes exactly lots of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater here and uh if it's too",

Now you can change your clothes to kind of adjust for the temperatures and stuff like you would in real life. Greg, oh yes, um so that's pretty interesting. It's there's a lot of questions I had as you can see there's like mushrooms all around, there's a bunch of food that you can get. What's crazy is we're so used to Zelda - you cut down the trees and stuff and what happens? Rupees pop out, Hearts pop out. No, not today. Things are different. Things are different - rupees are still here, you can't see them on this screen but later, yeah there you go in the menu top right, there's a rupee. Um, but you got all your food and stuff that's how you heal yourself. You can see that the steak if you eat it raw but cooking it will give it more potency, whatever. Um, there's also",

There's also different effects, so it's not just health. Like when you run, you have a stamina meter, you've seen it come up a couple times, it's above Link's head, it's this little like circle that kind of feels red, and that allows you to run at your full speed - he has a sprint as well that we'll see. He can also climb walls and do a whole bunch of stuff, like uh, you actually surprising there we go. There's this thing where he's running a bit, and you can see once it ends if you are punished for letting it run all the way out - and he kind of has to climb back up. He's doing some stuff, and you can see it kind of goes down there - he does this little like leapy jump, like Nathan Drake, and that makes the stamina go down really quickly. Gotcha! But if you kind of just take your time, go up slow.",

So I like that the enemy designs are obviously very influenced by the original Legend of Zelda, and this game as a whole I think is very much the original Legend of Zelda from the from the logo itself to kind of just this openness being left in a world where it's just like go you're not getting the weird tutorial stuff that we're so used to you're not getting the the hand-holdy fairy or Midna or whatever am I getting my wooden sword, my wooden shield there's a bunch of swords but again they break down over time here's the fire rod, a classic Zelda item wait a second wait a second did he just open a treasure chest and then not go has a different noise has a different noise they didn't do the closeup of him holding it up now I have a feeling that's only",

You're about to see soon, like look at the landscapes. This reminds me of like playing Jak and Daxter for the first time, and it's like everything you can see, you can go to. That's exactly true here. Can you go to that volcano? Um, yes, yes, you can. Um, so let me try to scroll ahead a little bit. So when I was doing the demo with Mr. Nintendo over there - Mr. Nintendo gave that I was giving him a hard time, so he was showing me right here. I forgot what this thing's called, I think it's called the Sheikah Slate or something like that. Um, he dropped a waypoint over there.

But what you can do is you can mark all the all the different logos and images you see here. You can kind of put his way points and mark wherever you you want.

Mhm, here we go some water, yeah, here we go snow and water and stuff. This is all the same area; you just got to keep going, and it eventually turns into this, and as it gets colder, you can see how cold it is on the thermometer thing. Ah, yes, it is - it's getting towards the blue there. My friend, that means Link's going to be shivering soon. It was a little weird playing it with the GamePad just because I'm not used to that, like being so big, but I think or with the yeah, the GamePad um with the Pro Controller, I think it's going to feel a lot better - it's going to feel like a much a very modern Zelda, that's the thing. Like this is a modern video game adaptation of what a Zelda should be, which I think is cool. So here amibo there's amiibo functionality; I was asking if um there was going to be uh a Na'vi or a Midna type",

So I was asking, I was like, all right, so what's up with dungeons, Zelda? You need the dungeons great. So dungeons are going to be a part of this game. There's going to be the typical Zelda kind of sprawling big puzzle thing. But there is over 100 shrines that are mini-dungeons; they're all over. We can see one up ahead, it's the blue thing. So you go in, and then those aren't necessarily going to give you the kind of reward that a dungeon would. But it is it's somewhere in between one of the little keep fighting enemies and um a real Dungeon. But they all have the similar kind of puzzle progression. But imagine two or three rooms of a dungeon instead of the entire thing, you're getting that. Um, then there's this this weapon here, the Magnesis which is",
