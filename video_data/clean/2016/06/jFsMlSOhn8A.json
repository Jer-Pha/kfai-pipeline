Al, although I said on Col Greg live that I actually was responsible for the whole show and the entire production, you crushed it - it's true, it was a great show. The power of persuasion, as we've been calling it. What was it like from your guys' perspective to walk in and see the venue and the production for the first time? It was awesome. I mean, I think uh, we had been briefed on the situation - you kept us updated, we knew what was happening and how the stage was going to look or whatever. But when you're like 'it's going to be a 100-foot video wall' and this is like the catwalk or whatever, you're like 'oh okay, I can picture that.'

I think that's the most important thing - is that every single person there wanted to like every single thing that was happening. That's the key magic that made this happen. If any other group of people was on that stage, this would have been the dumbest thing ever. Sure, because it was us, it was the dumbest thing ever. But people loved it, and I think that's the magic that we all have together - where it's like you really... It's a positivity that you just have to have. Like it's the same when you look at press conferences - like two different people can watch a press conference and be like 'that sucked' or 'oh my God, that was amazing.'

I wanted to make sure there was stuff referencing what he would be saying, which was a lot of work. How hard was that to edit?

And I think last year we did one of the highlights of last year for me was the beginning of it when we came with the intros, then went into the First skit that everyone was laughing about. So the goal was to push that pretty much have that going throughout the entire night, which I think we did a really good job of. Yeah, I mean I think the idea for me was it's about payoff of all the inside jokes we've created over the last year, you know, and you can look through all the different sections and it's just like it all makes sense for the people that are there, doesn't make sense for anybody else but",
