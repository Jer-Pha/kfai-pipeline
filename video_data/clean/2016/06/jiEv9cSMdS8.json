Um, and then he goes on: The word became more offensive over the next few centuries. While Cher used the variant \"quaint\" in both \"The Miller's Tale\" and \"The Wife of Bath's Tale\". Shakespeare dared only to slightly allude to the word, for example, when Ophelia tells Hamlet that yes, he can lie on her lap; Hamlet puns in his response: Do you think I meant country matters? That's some **** deep Middle English, sh right there in \"Twelfth Night\". Shakespeare finds a coded way to spell out the word when Malvolio recognizes his lady's use of it ends her teas. Um, um, so basically goes on; this is a really interesting story people can go read about like the the the evolution of it but he goes: Why has **** become so much more taboo than say \"snatch\" or ****?

That's just a phrase - 'God damn it' is just a thing you say. But then like people I know who are religious, like kind of, can see them getting uncomfortable, like man, this is weird, this is weird, you know? It's weird. But it's also your God is fake; my God... I even turn the crosses upside down. Um, I mean you really do have to judge words by the intent with which they were said. With that in mind, if I step on my toe and say 'God damn it,' I'm not meaning it to insult anyone's religion. It's not what I'm meaning it for.
