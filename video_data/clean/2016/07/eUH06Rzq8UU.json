Yeah, exactly. It happens that's how we communicate. I think there is definitely something special about first dates but it's just... it's funny and uh I have a lot of friends who go on a lot of dates - um most of them being First Dates, most of them being last dates but those dates kind of... there's no downside to it. It's like even a bad first date is usually still a good experience - um if you really don't like the person you're like all right cool I wasted an hour two hours whatever it is. You know?
