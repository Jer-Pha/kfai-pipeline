Something that I feel like you could even get down on. Oh, even I can get down on. Yeah, even you. You can get on this, man. The NES Classic Edition. Before we get into this, I want to read the press release that Nintendo sent out for this thing because I feel like the press release is one of the most important parts of this specific announcement. It's a very different Nintendo. I'm going to read it in full. If you see a Nintendo Entertainment System on store shelves this holiday shopping season, you haven't entered a time machine.

If that's the case, you may have unknowingly walked through a rift in the space-time continuum. The most likely scenario is you're setting eyes on the Nintendo Entertainment System NES Classic Edition, launching in stores on November 11th at a suggested retail price of $60. That's right, the NES is back. But this isn't the same NES that you finally remember. This new Nostalgia Field system is near identical. It's a mini replica of Nintendo's original home console and plugs directly into your high definition TV using an included HDMI cable. The console comes complete with 30 NES games built in, including beloved classics like Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, and Kirby's Adventure. The system comes packaged with an HDMI cable, an AC adapter, and one NES Classic controller, which is patterned after the iconic",

There's a little something for everybody. A nice mix of timeless classics, cult favorites, and maybe even some games that you never got around to playing. Each is sure to bring back memories and produce plenty of new ones. You can even enjoy playing several of those games with two players by attaching a second NES Classic Controller, which will be sold separately at a suggested retail price of $10. A classic controller or Classic Controller Pro can also be used, each sold separately. When connected to a Wii remote controller, the NES Classic Control can also be used to play Virtual Console NES games on a Wii or Wii U system. Playing these retro games using a retro controller makes the experience that much more authentic. And if you ever need to",

And if you ever need to step away from the NES Classic Edition in the middle of a tough level or take a break to call one of Nintendo's helpful game counselors, there's a little asterisk there. Don't worry about losing any hard earned progress. Each game is multiple suspend points so you can start where you left off at a later time. No passwords needed. What's old is new again with the Nintendo Entertainment System NES Classic Edition. Relive past glories, finish off that boss you never beat. Save the galaxy and rescue the princess. Then there's the asterisk back. Please only call if you have indeed entered a time machine. The game council program no longer exists in 2016.

Some of it makes you go, \"Eh, whatever.\" But no matter what you do, a press release is going to do that. Nintendo are usually really cringe-worthy and really just like uh please stop. I appreciate this. This is a different Nintendo. This is Nintendo aiming at the nostalgia in the way that we'd like them to. So, I don't know. What do you think, Colin? I think it's great. I think it's an exciting announcement. I think that there's problems with it, but I think that it's a cool way to expose people to some of these classic games, as I said before, and I stand by it.

You're not going to get much better than Mega Man 2. You're not going to get much better um, than The Legend of Zelda um, in terms of gameplay. And so I think that this is a cool uh little ode to that. The NES is my favorite console of all time. I mean, I'm a, as I've said many times, I mean, I'm a reformed Nintendo fan, but I don't know many people that know or ate up Nintendo like I did in the NES, NES, N64, GameCube era. So, it's like those are that is like part of my bloodstream. So, NES is by far my favorite console. Has a **** fantastic catalog of games.

Um so I was like what are we going to see on here like Yoshi's Island and games like that. And then um lo and behold, a very Nintendo move for them is that they're working with third parties. I mean they worked with Konami, they worked with Square Enix, they worked with Capcom. I mean they worked with a lot of guys here to get some of their games on there.

I mean, there are even Nintendo games that are missing that like could be on there over some of the games that are on there. So, there's there's certain weirdness there. But when I look at that catalog of games, I'm like, this is a fantastic collection of games and uh overall and I'm excited to play it. And as I said on I think Colin and Greg, like I've been I've been kind of plotting a let's play series called Colin Plays the Classics, which I think we'll roll out at sometime this fall.

I mean, there's a lot of cool **** on there. Um, and so I'm excited for me and I'm excited for Nintendo fans like me, but I'm or old school Nintendo fans like me, but I'm also actually way more excited for people that have never played these games. Um, that said, it would be cool if there was some flash memory on it. It would be cool if there was some sort of Wi-Fi connection or something that you could do to get these, you know, some to get other virtual console games or there's some sort of port where they could be like, you know, we're wave two, wave three, wave four of these games. You just plug it right in and play them. Um, that said, I don't think it's that big of a deal. You know, this is a cool thing.",

You know, this is a cool thing. 60 bucks for 30 games, $2 a game. I mean, what's crazy about that is so these games, um, I I want to say they're all available on virtual console, whether it's the the Wii or Wii U virtual console. And, uh, when you add up the price of that, it's something like $150 if you were to buy them all. Yeah, if you were to buy the original cartridges, obviously it's a lot more, especially nowadays, like trying to find them. Some of them are pretty rare. Um, so when you add that up, $60 is a a deal for these, especially if you haven't played them before. And especially with Nintendo, so many people have played these before, so it's like this is probably their fifth, sixth time buying these games. I think this is a really nice way to do it.

I think this is a the more physical version of that where it's just like, you know, the NES is the most iconic system of all time. The most iconic controller for sure. And I think this is a really cool way to kind of get in touch with that the Urban Outfitters kind of uh generation of people where it's just like even if you're not a gamer, you still think the NES is cool, you know? It's like I feel like back in uh 2002ish when they did the GBA series for any I don't what was that the 20th anniversary or something like that. Yeah. With the e-reader card.

I don't know why they did that of the of the NES and on GBA they released all of the like a bunch of these games. A couple others like Urban Champion was like why the hell would you do that? But uh those are $20 games which was almost full price for a GBA game back then which is which was worth it for some of them and not worth it for others.

No, a couple of Yeah, I'm seeing the box art in my mind. The box art was so it was GBA that they did the when it was like the NES box art. They actually did the GBASP that looked like the Famicom or NES. You're right. And um that was super exciting. But again, like when you think of the the price of that and then throughout the years there was Virtual Console and then the Wii U virtual console. So it's like you're buying the same games for $5, $4, whatever it is over and over. Then you look at this collection. This is very un-Nintendo because of the third-party stuff. When you looked at their virtual console lineups in the past, they all are congruent with that GBA release where it's like, \"All right, cool. It is the the ones you expect plus a couple\"",

Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong. Too much Donkey Kong, man. Way too much Donkey Kong on there, too. Yeah, just too much. They're very different games. And Pac-Man on there, too. When we get to Double Dragon II, Dr. Mario, Excite Bike. Yeah. Final Fantasy. That's the weirdest one. Final Fantasy. Yeah, that's the weirdest one for sure. That's the only role-playing game. And the like and the and the depth of that game is like way more than any other games. I'll be interested to see how people take to that. The original Final Fantasy, I think, is fantastic.

That was a weird one. So then the other thing about Final Fantasy that's interesting is it's just the first one and there are better versions of that game out too. Yeah. I mean well being it's the first one's not not surprising because two and three were Famicom games but we didn't get them till later. We never got them in the states. The bigger surprise to me was yeah. Like what you said the PSP version of Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II is way better. But again exactly that's not what they're dealing with here. Um Galaga, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Gradius. Ghosts 'n Goblins is a weird one to be on here. Yeah. Ice Climber.\n\nNote: I corrected the following errors:\n\n* \"Dragon Warrior\" to \"Dragon Quest\" (correct name of the series)\n* \"Famicom games\" to keep as is (it's a correct term, but I added an apostrophe in \"Ghosts 'n Goblins\")\n* \"Final Fantasy 2\" to \"Final Fantasy II\" (correct Roman numeral)",

All right, so this is a weird one, too. So Mega Man 2 obviously is iconic Nintendo game. I'm a little surprised Mega Man 3 is not on there, too. Or Mega Man 1. So like one and two or two and three, but anyway, Metroid, Ninja Gaiden, which is awesome. Again, **** awesome game. The original Ninja Gaiden is **** classic. There's just some classic **** games on here, man. But again, why not all three of them? Pac-Man, Punch Out, Star Tropics, Super C, which is the like that's a weird Contra. Yeah, I don't understand why Super C's on there. The Super C is fine, but like it's not Contra. Yeah, I don't know why Contra wouldn't be on there. And Star Tropics being in here is **** cool, too",

Very Zelda-like. That one came out on the GBA thing. I'm pretty sure it probably did. Um, Super Mario Bros. 1, Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3, Legend of Zelda, and Zelda 2. It's a great lineup, dude. Now, that's the thing. When you look at this, this kind of is the all-star lineup of NES games. And yeah, there is a couple things missing here and there, but it's like that's this is way better than I would have ever imagined.

I don't remember that port being exceptionally good, but well, I think a big thing too that you need to remember is Smash Bros. So, like Smash Bros. has made a whole bunch of things relevant in Nintendo in a way that they weren't before. So that's why Balloon Fight to me is obvious. Like Balloon Fight's gotten so much love over the years that there is a nostalgia nostalgic factor for people that didn't even grow up playing it just because of Smash Bros. Yeah. Yeah. I respect that. There's a few games that I would have loved to be on there. A lot of people were saying like, \"Where's Kung Fu? The Iron Fist.\" Yeah. We were talking about I guess they didn't, you know, I don't even know who the **** owns that IP anymore. The uh Kung Fu would have been nice on there. I think um Castlevania III not being on there.

I I love that game. Simon's Quest is **** awesome and Simon's Quest is really a precursor to the open world role playing games we play today today and certainly an open a precursor to the open world uh Metroidvania style games before we ever had that name for it, you know. Um but I was surprised to see it on there cuz that game's not that game is very divisive. A lot of people don't like that game. Um, so I'll be interested to see that's like so, if you don't mind me taking your phone, the Castlevania 2 and Final Fantasy, Ghosts 'n Goblins, and I would even say like the original Ninja Gaiden are the games I'm actually most interested to see what people think about.

I mean, it's beatable, but that game, the funny thing about that game, you have to beat it twice. But I think that's why it's on this list is because when people think about old Nintendo games, I think Ghosts 'n Goblins is one of those ones. Like to me, I'm surprised Paper Boy is not here because that's another game that's just like that's a Nintendo game even though it's not Nintendo. Sure. But like for an outsider like me, like I know Balloon Fight after years of people talking about Balloon Fight. Yeah, Paperboy would make a lot of sense. Mhm. Yeah.

A lot of the Capcom games like DuckTales and stuff are licensed so you can't I understand why those games aren't on there. Chip 'n Dale and stuff like that. Uh Ninja Turtles. Yeah, Ninja Turtles obviously. Um or I mean I would have loved to see the original like the Ultra NES game but TMNT2 which is the arcade game. Yeah. Uh would have been cool but so I but again a lot of license issues there. Biggest missing one out of all this is Duck Hunt.

I would have I mean there's there's games that are if you want to be nitpicky and really get into it. I think the original Metal Gear would have been really **** cool to put on here but again the NES port of Metal Gear is not really well remembered. It's the MSX port that people really love or the MSX original of Metal Gear. But then again, we were talking about Pac-Man. The Pac-Man port I don't remember being very good.

So you know, I'm glad that you know they avoided that too because Kirby is a later game for the NES. whole lifespan here. Um, I'm really interested to see what the system actually is, like what hard hardware it's running cuz the it uses the the same proprietary thing that the Wii U and or the Wii remotes use.

I think that you think whatever controller you're plugging into whatever the NES is going to be would have that port to it or yeah it still accepts your Wii U gamepad and your Wii U whatever it is all that stuff. So I think that's interesting. I I think that the the reason they chose a lot of these games is to kind of appeal to that Urban Outfitters crowd that is just retro to be retro. Well, it's appealing to the mall crowd, right? I mean, for how many years has it been that you walk into a mall and you go by that one kiosk that has these like retrofitted N64s that play 60 games and it's all this random **** and you're like this can't be legal. But this is why you're a pop-up in the middle of the mall and not a real store. Yeah, exactly. And we've seen that forever with like Atari and with a lot of the like random **** Uh Sega recently in the",

The fact that this is Nintendo and the fact that they're putting so much care into it. I mean, the packaging is to me insane. I can when I first saw this pop up, it felt like an April Fool's joke, you know, cuz it looked too good to be It looked too good to be true where it's just like, man, there there's a lot of care being put into this. Um, and the pricing is perfect. $60, they could have charged way more for this. I'm shocked it's not 100. And the the NES controller being $10, that's not even in line with their like controller, but like Nunchuk Nunchucks were $20. Yeah, it's cool. I like it. I think that they're just",

I think that they're just making it affordable. Maybe making smaller rips. They have to pay out these third parties, too. So, um, might not be a money play, it might be a volume play. And at that point, I I I I think the only thing you can complain about, as I said, is like it would have been cool to have some sort of flash card, like flash drive, you know, in there, uh, to read a car, SD card, whatever you want to do, like that they could have sold to put more games on here. But I can't complain. Even if they did this again next year with 30 more games and sold the hardware again, I'd be like, fine. Like my question is, are they going to do a Super NES? So, the thing that I think is really cool is No, it didn't copy over. There's an official like N the NES Classics logo that they made. Oh, really? Nintendo doesn't",

Nintendo doesn't really make logos for things unless they're big deals but there's an actual line like the classics line is going to be a thing and that's really exciting because yeah like there could definitely be a wave two of this there could be whatever and I think the thing with the SD cards or whatever gets too complicated this is meant to just be it's the simple plug-and-play thing and I think coming off of Pok\u00e9mon Go Nintendo has a really nice kind of um buzz about them that I think this this is going to be awesome to see the people that aren't necessarily gamers how many of them are going to be interested in getting this thing because I'm hearing a whole bunch of buzz about this and just like looking on the internet and stuff.

That's the whole thing like and that's what I think it applies. I mean, it's the form factor. It's the, you know, looking at this retro device you remember so fondly. But, yeah, it's you could go play these games on any one of these virtual consoles. The thing is is that when I first saw this before I started reading about the first thing that came to mind I was like wow they're manufacturing a new Nintendo and like are they going to make like I I thought they were going to like it was like cartridges and everything like I I was like I that's like for a second I was like that's  awesome but then it became the smaller thing which makes way more",

Why wouldn't it be the top loader? And that's why I think for for wave two if they made another console that the the form factor for the wave two should be the top loader and it should be another set of 30 games all third party which would be cool. then we can really explore the nitty-gritty of **some** of the games that people really enjoyed um that might be a little more under the radar or whatever. But I think this is this is going to be if they do another one there. I actually think they're going to go Game Boy. Yeah, I was going to say Game Boy would be next. I think they would jump to just like some a little like i don't even know what the form factor would be. Much smaller, maybe more Game Boy",

Like it doesn't necessarily have games like this cuz it's like I I can't see them putting the Pok\u00e9mon on it for example. Yeah, spread. Well, the SNES would be awesome and they probably will do that. That's when you really have a problem with what games you put on there because I actually think that their first party output is way more limited on NES and overshadowed by third-party greatness. I mean, for every Link to the Past or um Super Mario World, whatever you have on there, you have Street Fighter. You have a million other games that are coming from other from third parties as they really ramped at like",

You have a million other games that are coming from other third parties as they really ramped up and even when you think about their first party output on NES, a lot of that was very frontloaded. They were publishing all the games to begin with, but when you get to like 1989, 1988, 1990, um you really start seeing a lot of great third party games that overshadow their output. You know, Mario 3 comes sneaks out in there, but so does Mega Man 2 and so does, you know, a bunch of other titles. So, I think the SNES would be way more interesting. I'd love to be behind closed doors with these guys figuring out what games they were going to put on there and how they were going to try to license them because um you can have a really good fight. I mean, you can make an SNES just with role playing games. Mhm. Yeah. Like which would be so cool. I was talking to Greg about this. I'm really",

I was talking to Greg about this. I'm really excited that this came out of nowhere and none of us saw it coming and it didn't leak at all and it was just one day just announced and it was official. Uh because that says a lot for the NX where it's like all these things that are leaked or whatever. There might be nothing leaked from it like hardware wise. The fact that this is a piece of hardware that exists that we knew nothing about until it's happening uh is really exciting to me because it shows that Nintendo is capable of keeping secrets in a day and age when secrets are really hard to keep when especially when it comes to hardware and stuff like that.
