You're getting Tokyo. They're definitely going to do one there. Uh so I would say E3, Tokyo, Game Show, and then PSX. I think if they can do it those three, as you said in the past, the PSX press conference last year was bad. Uh there was no first party pop there at all.

I could imagine this being an even greater need with games like Resident Evil that inherently already have a jump factor to them. Thanks for the years of entertainment. Keep up the good work, Brian.

There is no season pass for PlayStation 4 of course. Of course, because this is all included at the release. Blood Ties is a new premium DLC. It beckons players to explore Croft Manor in a new story mode, then defend it against a zombie invasion in Lara's Nightmare. When Lara's uncle contests the ownership of the manor, I should say, Lara must explore the estate to find proof that she is the rightful heir or lose her birthright and her family secrets for good. Uh, players can then test their zombie killing skills in the replayable Lara's nightmare mode, a haunted Croft Manor, where players have new challenges and must rid the manor of an evil presence.

Um, it's active time battle. So, not necessarily turn-based, but pretty close. So, you think about like old Final Fantasy games. Um, what am I missing here?

Um there are there are two things that bother me in Japanese role playing games. Uh Lunar I think actually was one of the games that I really loved but did this in Silver Star story and I think in Eternal Blue which was um when you in in those games you level up and actually enemies scale with you and there are games that do that kind of thing.

So it stops you from farming. So I have one problem with that. That's not the problem with I Am Setsuna. The problem with I Am Setsuna is actually deeper. Your character doesn't have statistics. Like you're basically leveling up only hit points and magic points when you level up. Um, and you're only equipping the talismans on you which have like some latent effects and a weapon. The weapon has physical and magic power and physical and magic defense and that's it. So those are the only statistics in the game. Okay. So you have like I feel like leveling up isn't exciting and it's coming from the fact that you don't earn money in combat. You get items that you sell to get money. So it's like an unnecessary step.

If those systems were cleaned up and I felt like it was a little bit more rewarding, the grind was a little bit more rewarding then I would actually think the game was great. But I was disappointed to see that. I also find that there's a system called flexing in the game that I don't even I've played the game for 15 hours. I still have no idea how it works. Like there so there's these things called there's a clever thing in the combat system. There's these little circles next to everyone's icon like on the bottom of the screen.

Set in a lush and vibrant world of the Forgotten Realms, Sword Coast Legends offers an all new way to enjoy the time-tested magic of playing Dungeons & Dragons as a shared storytelling experience. Couldn't they tell that Dungeons & Dragons is giving a flying **** about what their games are releasing since they're releasing Neverwinter with that IP and Sword Coast Legends in the same week. Smart. Very smart as usual. Um, that's it, Colin. Yes. Pick of the week. Soon enough for sure. I That game doesn't sound like it's for me. 10-second ninja looks really cool, by the way. That's the 10-Second Ninja. I have 10 Second Ninja, Lifeless Planet written down. I wrote down Ninja Pizza Girls just cuz it's interesting, but I'm not doing that. I want to play Lifeless Planet.

In recent weeks, Sony San Diego's free-to-play experiments have been mentioned a couple of times. While it may be a little far-fetched, how do you guys feel about the idea of Sony San Diego's major title, MLB The Show, becoming freeto play? Hear me out, Colin. Imagine a model of MLB, freeto play, where you can only play a significantly short shortened single player season without some of the bells and whistles. No multiplayer, no custom matches, etc. I'm personally not interested in baseball games, but I am interested in this title. While I may not pay $60 for the game, I may have more of an incentive if I was given a taste. Best regards, Weird Koala. P.S. I really do love",

The idea of let's learn it and then let's apply it to our biggest baseball - the baseball franchise. I don't necessarily think so. No, I think it would be foolish of them to do that because they make so much money on MLB. You think then they're hung up on it and doing all this free-to-play stuff as just they want to test it out for Sony. They want to - I think that they're experimenting there for the benefit of all the first-party studios. Um but I don't think it has anything to do with the show. I think that they're able to do that because the show is so profitable, right? So I think that's basically the reason why it's happening at Sony San Diego. But I don't know.",

For me, it's a great question or idea at least. Do I think that's what's happening? No, I don't think we'll see that anytime soon. But if they did, that'd be fascinating. Even if they just put out a free-to-play version, which is really just a demo. But I enjoy the show enough, but I don't buy the show. I don't play the show religiously.

Oh no, 300 stars is all the stars and X rank all marathon modes. Um otherwise it seems like if you can get that, you can get all the other ones. So there's that. Uh Moon Hunters 29 bronze, nine silver, three gold, one platinum. Um, a lot of these seem to be story based. I mean, in fact, all of them are story based. Um, commune with all of your ancestors. Remember the holy river is another one. Impress a child with your bravery. Delve into a sun cultist ziggurat. You love Deligit. So, there's that. A drift trophies.

Recently, a Drift trophy list came out with no platinum and 15 total trophies in total. I saw on Twitter a conversation between the game's creator and a fan in which they claimed, quote, \"PlayStation doesn't allow us to use platinum trophies for a small digital only PSN game.\" Unfortunately, this seems somewhat inaccurate to me. Games like Oxenfree, Adam's Venture, Adam's Venture Origins, LA Cops, and Eterna Light 1 to name a few have 15 or less trophies and all have platinums. As someone with over 24,000 trophies, I know a thing or two about them. And how it's based on point system, but Sony or PlayStation's mixed messages to devs regarding them seems odd.

This hidden gem was released on the PlayStation 2 in early 2002, and it was a 3D successor to the Ghosts 'n Goblin series. It's a uniquely difficult platformer that received positive reviews and enough interest to develop a sequel, but I rarely see it mentioned nowadays.
