Jennifer Aniston - for the record, I am not pregnant; what I am is fed up. I'm fed up with the sort of scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of journalism and the First Amendment and celebrity news.

Have we ever really been insular? People have always been coming over here. The Germans came over here, like people forget. Like everyone's looking at, well look, look at the Central and South Americans coming over here, and I'm like, dude, that's just the next wave of the waves and waves and waves of people from around the world that came here. It's just the next Chinese coming over here to build the railroads; the Japanese coming over at the turn of the 19th or turn of the 20th century; the Germans coming over at the Puritans, uh, like everyone, a lot of free Africans coming over in the 1600s that didn't last very long unfortunately in our system.

I met every single thing I said; I know I know I know I know dare as a comic book fan what I love about broccoli is the fact that it has a natural antagonist in cauliflower cuz cauliflower is such a knockoff broccoli and you see that they are not fans one or not friends one is more popular than the other. I like cauliflower better than broccoli, that's... but I think broccoli is better for you so it gets the nod for me. Why is it? I didn't know; it's why is it better for for my diet specifically?

You can't throw those three together; carrots you buy separately. Carrots are their own thing, and here's why: because by the time you get to the carrot, it's covered in the little things of the little leaves of the broccoli and the cauliflower, and you can't separate them. And then it's going everywhere every time you try to dip it; places it on your hand; it's a mess. Carrots first; you can't cuz you got to dig through them. You have to dig through the bag, and it's just dirty. I'm just saying: keep the carrots separate.
