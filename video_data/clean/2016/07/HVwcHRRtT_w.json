I'm Greg, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at him, and we talk it out for your amusement if you like that. Like the video, share it with your friends, subscribe to us here on YouTube. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is \"Colin Andor\" suffers a brain injury 50th date style. What does the other friend do to remind them of their friendship from Fonzie? Hey, hey, what are you going to do for friends, Mrs. C? Well, we know... We talk about happy. Is that what we would do? No. If if uh so I you you you hurt your head, you wake up every day, you don't remember me. I got to remind you. But you wake up in our house obviously.

We'd make a video with Tim Gettys and Nick where we would explain who you were and stuff. But then we'd probably watch an episode of Seinfeld every day, and then we'd probably eat some gravy fries, some wings - Wayne Gretzky's favorite! That's simple, that's easy. Yeah, no, if you... I would wake you up, I'd massage you a little bit, let you know kiss you on the cheek, and uh, because that wouldn't creep me out. I wake up with no memory, there's a man massaging me, kissing my cheek - yeah! And then uh, I would order, I'd have a constant supply of those Portillo boxes that we get sometimes from Illinois. They would send them to us. We'd prepare the Portillo hot dogs for you - a little bit of celery salt, a little bit of some onion. You don't like that, but I do! I like the onion. CH-style hot dogs, we gotta get the yellow mustard out.",

We gotta do it get the yellow mustard out there, no, no. Get a little mayonnaise and ketchup on it now, now, now you pervert. What it was so basically it's not about you, it's about me. And this is what I would pretend is normal. I would be like, \"No, this is what you...this great, you love mayonnaise hot dog.\" This doesn't feel like what I would like. This would solve one of your greatest problems though, is that you could get rid of Portillo's at anytime. I wouldn't know, no. You would have no idea he would just not be here and I wouldn't even...hang him in effigy and then you would...be like \"what\" and you'd be like \"what happened here?\" Why is this dog? This dog is a reminder. This is the dog that tripped you and you fell and hit your head. Oh yeah, well that's actually how it would probably really go down. Yeah, that's a fun one.
