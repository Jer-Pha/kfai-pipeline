I would love to hear it. Disgusting! Wow, and that, that is a direct quote. Yeah, it's because uh, he likes to demand that his girlfriend lick him - a true story, a true story. \"Wa lick\" - he goes, \"Lick my tongue.\" It was more of a statement. He's been a man... Been a man. You're telling your woman you're being upfront and telling your woman what you want. You're telling her what you want, and you're also making sure that she knows under the penalty of threat of bodily harm that she has to do what you want her to do. Right, Kevin? That's where you're going with this. So anyway... Uh, I would have to say Kevin's not great. You gotta do something about Kevin.",
