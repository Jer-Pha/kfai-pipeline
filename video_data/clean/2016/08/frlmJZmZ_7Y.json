You proposed to Gia, you Salty Dog, I didn't even hear um so my friends proposed and I was the, uh, the host of all that that topic and stuff but that led me to being really excited about proposals in a way that I had been in a long time went down a rabbit hole of watching a whole bunch of proposal videos which are one of my favorite things because again like I said in that topic it just makes me happy of course um last night I ended up doing even more of that and that led to finding videos of, uh, like army people coming back to their families or which then led to videos of deaf people hearing for the first time and just things like and now I'm not really sure what this topic is but those videos make me feel a certain way that is so unique you know and it but I love that it it's the same feeling you know it's this feeling of, uh, happiness and",
