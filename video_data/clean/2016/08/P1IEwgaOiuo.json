Uh, Yousef from MCU says with the success of Pok\u00e9mon Go and Battlefront, how important do you think IP is to a video game? Oh, hugely important, extremely important. It's important having something that's identifiable is like the most important thing for marketing, and marketing is how things get sold. So um, in terms of the success of a game, I think it's easier for people to wrap their heads around what something is when they can visualize it already.
