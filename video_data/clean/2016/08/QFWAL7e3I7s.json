Hello, hello! How are you? I'm great. Greg, how are you? I'm great too. You got a little shammy all set to go? Yeah, this one's got the texture to the shammy here. This works really nicely. You like that? Is it getting more... is it getting more of the dirt off your glasses? I think so. How long have you had these glasses? A while, like a few years. I just bought these glasses; I bought them right before Kinda Funny Live. Yeah, got them prescription too strong, had to give them back, had to get them dialed down. Then I've just been moving so much, I haven't been able to get back over there. I noticed though, over in the Kinda Funny Live poster we put up in the office, you still had these; it had the little... had the same little thing on it: the little side guy, the little silver side guy.

So you know, you just let the blue steel go with life where they're at exactly. So it's uh, you know these are the ones I've settled on, and we'll see what happens in the future. Yeah, you thinking about shaking it up sometime? No, I've always wanted red frames but I just don't think I can pull them off. Don't do that, no, can't do that. You don't think I can pull it off with big frames and colored frames like unless they're like very earthy colors.

What have you been playing lately? Uh, I don't even know. Oh, I beat Headlander. Oh, thoughts - it's fantastic. Um, really nice Metroidvania. What I'm impressed about with that particular game is the um, is the design of it in the sense that there's a million different ways that game could break and and they must have been very deliberate in designing it in order to not let it break.

Um, you thought you get into a room, you can get exactly and like there was always a way to like advance or go so I... You know, I mean Double Fine is not a dumb studio. I me make games, but I feel like that was probably very complicated game from that perspective to be like, \"Wow, like we really do have to think of every little angle here.\" Um, I got like 80% of the trophies. Maybe I'll go back in Platinum, but I don't know. But it's one of my favorite games of the year, I think. I...

However, after I got the game, I am really enjoying it, but it feels a little bit hollow like there is no real purpose in the game at first, I didn't understand why everybody was complaining so much about the game calling Sean Murray a liar; but after seeing the Sean Murray interviews and trailers, one thing was clear: the game was falsely advertised. Developers were showing and talking about dozens of features which were ultimately not in the game. Hell, even on the Co-Op show last year, Murray talked about the ability to see other players' sand planets, giant worms, portals, huge space battles, and numerous other features that aren't really in the game.

I hope that people don't take away from that lesson in 2020 and 2024 that you can't run from outside the apparatus, that you can't be brash, you can't say what's on your mind right, and it's a similar kind of comparison with No Man's Sky where I hope the takeaway isn't like don't do things differently and don't do things boldly and don't do things ambitiously.

Players explore the environment and use pistols, shotguns, flamethrowers, explosives, and chainsaws to kill mutant creatures. Combat is accompanied by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and exaggerated blood splatter effects as players progress through the story. Cutscenes can depict instances of gore and intense acts of violence; a character's arm dismembered by a chainsaw, a man's leg taken off at the knee with a shovel, a character impaled through the face with a shovel, some areas also depicting mutilated corpses with exposed organs and viscera.

For example, every time I would hit the right stick, it would jerk - it would jerk my viewpoint in that direction. This was the only way to turn around, and it just felt weird and unnatural to me. It didn't make me sick or anything, but I was just wondering: is this how most VR games are going to work, or is it just this particular demo? The game also seemed pretty blurry to me, and I left the demo feeling a bit underwhelmed. Have you guys had similar experiences using VR/RE7? I'd love your thoughts.

Yes, let's check them with the listeners okay, hello listeners. If you didn't know, ladies and gentlemen, you can be a part of PS I Love You XOXO by going to Kinda Funny.com/PSQ and posting your question on the forums just like Jake did. Hey guys, hope all is well. I played Inside this week, and while I enjoyed it, I am slightly disappointed that it was pretty much an upgraded, flashier Limbo. I wasn't expecting Playdead to depart from what made Limbo great, but I figured there would be at least additional core mechanics. Can you guys speak on Studio progression and the line developers walk when trying to create a new game that stays true to what made their previous title successful but also expands on it without going too far? Are there examples of these iterative successes or failures that stick out to you, and what Studios do you think do a good job at this? Thank you so much, Jake.",

Limbo always felt a bit stiff and heavy, whereas for uh Inside as much as I didn't like the ending necessarily, I loved that ride, I enjoyed that experience, I liked the puzzles - I felt like they learned a lot from Limbo. Was a game where I was heading to the wall over over like what the **** how do I get over here **** **** **** and like when you I walked by and watched you play I was like oh yeah I remember this part and I didn't I I got not stuck here like for hours but I did stop for a second like what what am I supposed to do, how do I figure it out - this is the major improvement and not the giant leap, but the step.",

I feel yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Like I said, I'm interested; people seem to be very well-received. I do think the hyperbole about it being the best game of the year is a little much, but sure. I haven't beaten it yet; maybe I'll feel very different. Super super interested to hear your ending. I, I don't know that it's it's that good, but I but I also felt like Limbo wasn't nearly as good as everyone thought it was too, so maybe maybe it's something that's just lost on me.

Like, at least make them fight for it. You have the money, the capital, and the goodwill to fight on that hill again, and you're not going to beat mobile phones, but here's a little point I was trying to make: there are 2.8 billion smartphones in the world; 2.8 billion, there are 650,000 games right now on the App Store, uh, 1% of the audience accounts for 58% of revenue, and only about a fourth of total revenue comes from smartphone games last year, handheld gaming accounted for about 3%, with maybe 50 million units, so what I'm saying is that there's money to be made there at less of an investment and a better guarantee of success on the game by game.",

And yeah, maybe two or three percent of gaming revenue is not that impressive when the PS4 is murdering and it's around 45 million units right now. But that's nothing to shy away from; there's money to be made there. Why people take pride that mobile gaming accounts for a fourth of gaming revenue with 2.8 billion devices and 650,000 games is beyond me because that's actually embarrassing.
