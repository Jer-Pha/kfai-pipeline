But so, the thing with this is, like, this is not unique to relationships between you know, lovers. It's that's something you deal with every day. It's lunchtime we're at work, it's like where do we eat then? It's that constant fight. I think it really comes down to weeding out the options. So it's like all right, so what do we not want? Is there any genre that we want, you know what I mean? Mexican, Chinese, pizza - these are genres you know, you kind of whittle it down that way and kind of go from there. It's like Asian, okay, which Asian are we talking about? Japanese or are we talking about Chinese? You can go from there. It's like oh, I just had Japanese, I don't want that. You need to kind of go through that, that kind of just the flowchart and you'll eventually get some good advice. What I like to do is I like to pick like two restaurants that I know that person likes and then one that I know we\"",

Where do you want to go to lunch? I'm thinking Chipotle. I like Chipotle. I don't love Chipotle. Is there something like Chipotle that might be like Chipotle but better than Chipotle, but cheaper than Chipotle and closer than Chipotle? No no no no, you don't do that. That's that's way too many words. You just you just say it and you say \"you either want it or don't want it.\" You don't need to give reasons. You don't need to do anything. It's just like all right this place. No I had it last night. This place here, here's the reason I don't want that that place. I'm okay with that really if you just say \"I'm okay\" you don't want the other person to know that you want something right if you're okay with it they'll let it slide if you want to take it a step further I have a spreadsheet of food places uh all around near the studio that",
