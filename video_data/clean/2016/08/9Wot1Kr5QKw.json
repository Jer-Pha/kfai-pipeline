This new critically acclaimed entry into the Deus Ex Universe once again has players taking on the role of Adam Jensen with an all-new arsenal of state-of-the-art weapons and augmentation. See what all the excitement is about at dx.com. Colin, that's a great game for Mario World. It's a uh well, Mario World's on my list. Mario World's on my list as well, so I mean I'll and mine's not in any order, I guess either um but the thing that made Mario World special and and I've said this before but to me Mario World is by far the best launch game ever created and by far the best bundled-in game ever created. So not only like an ancillary game but a first-party bundled-in game that people bought later on, which is the same with all the Mario games and and Nintendo really was was the marquee I think of great launch games.

Um, Wily likes programs a guy called Dr. Wily or whatever his name is, that like uses all of the like... and I love the art that they drew and Drew him too. Where it has like he has like the weapons on his back basically, like, and takes the arm can yeah, like there's cool stuff so you like you fight all the eight bosses and there's great Magnet Man, my favorite robot master in any of the games, but there's Shadow Man and Snake Man and Gemini Man. There are great guys in that. Gemini Man is an awesome boss battle on the NES. Capcom made a boss that split into two and ran around and it worked pretty well.

Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver, you face off against Red, the main character from the first ones at the end of it which was mind-blowing but also going back it did feel empty like going back to Kanto was awesome and like super nostalgic and there was all these updates and stuff but you definitely get the sense that they didn't have enough time to finish it cuz they turned those out so fast so it's I didn't know about that about Mega Man 3 yeah there's like there's like it's not optimized like there is a lot of um like I'm used to playing it this way but like in Dr. Wily's stage when you go",

And artists like it's very cumbersome, it takes a long time, it's expensive. That's why even Bloodstained is 2.5D - go look at that game and just marvel at the enemies and how beautiful that game is.

If you want or you can teach them to everyone and customize the characters exactly how you want it is a super deep game. And while I appreciate um uh the material system and all that kind of stuff, none of these games have anything in any respect on Final Fantasy VI in my mind, that is a fantastic game. You've got to play it if you haven't played it. There's an opera scene in a Super Nintendo game - it's so... the opera scene I don't even want to spoil the story for people who are going to play it. The Opera scene's really important in the game, it's a bait and switch on Setzer, and and it gets Setzer involved with your party because he has an airship and you need it. Um, and that is an I - that's why I want to see Final Fantasy VI remade in some respect one day, because that scene is super sad and emotional, and you can feel it. It's really... it's hours long, and you can feel Cid's pain actually in that like as well, like he likes Longs for this.",

There's been so many ideas over the years, but what's super awesome is there are rumors of an NX (Nintendo Switch) remake of VI, which would just blow my mind. So, so, so awesome! It's such a huge deal for JRPG fans out there, especially younger ones or people who just didn't have access to SNES games like Wild Arms and Final Fantasy VI. You have to play these games. And then the last two are newer games: Bioshock, which is phenomenal with a great story; people always question why I like this game because it's kind of...
