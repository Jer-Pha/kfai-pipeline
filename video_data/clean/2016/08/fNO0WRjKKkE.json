Turns out we like talking about our favorite games - who would have thought so? That was the first three topics; that was the first three topics.\n\nThe final topic is brought to you by Steven Inler, Patreon producer. He of course went over to patreon.com/kindafunnygames and showed his support yet again this month.

Sure cuz it's supposed to be a role-playing game, and I see like in Mass Effect 3 how it is a role-playing game, in any respect, to be honest. Jimmy Wong, we know Jimmy Wong, we do.

It's just I don't understand the reverence everyone has for this based on the original Zelda, The Legend of Zelda 2: Link to the Past, and then Ocarina of Time, and Majora's Mask are all better. They're all better than Link's Awakening. It's the portable factor, and I think that you know, Link's Awakening felt different than those games like it had a smaller scale but it felt more detailed to me. Sure, I, I, I remember getting it loved it. I there was actually a part of the game I was stuck on for **** ever too that annoyed the **** out of me. I can't even tell you it was something with the Animal Village, there wasn't the Village of animals or something. I was like I don't know what the **** I'm supposed to do here.
