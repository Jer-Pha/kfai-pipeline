And uh, that's another thing with uh, we always talk about Kick-Ass. I think Kick-Ass the movie did a really good job of nailing the tone and feel of the book, but I actually prefer the movie over the book even though the book is awesome and I love it. Oh, I would agree with you on that one. I prefer the movie over the book on Kick-Ass.

Watch um, X-Men First Class, Superman one, not two, Kick-Ass. I mean, I can make I can sit here and I can talk to you for another whole topic. Superman 1 versus Superman 2; let's move on. Superman 1's a great flick, but it does the same thing where it's just like why do we have to see this origin story again? And it's a very... it's a but again, you have to take it back yourself back to that time where like for the first time you are seeing Krypton and you are seeing the ship and you are seeing all this different stuff. Superman 2 just gets right to business; right, awesome Zod. You kidding me? You **** kidding me also Superman Ursa also",

Also Superman Ursa. Also Superman then comes back and beats some guy up at a diner for no reason. Never seen anything like that before. You're a superhero, you're Superman. Why are you beating this guy up? This is just garbage. It's like that scene in Man of Steel, yeah, where he wrecks the truck. He wrecks the truck and it's like... that's an honest move. He could have just easily picked him up and put him outside instead of ruining his truck. That's kind of messed up. Yeah, it was totally messed up and it wasn't a smart move as far as hiding goes. Why did you let him humiliate himself? You can just pick him up like you're a bouncer. What are you doing? I think he was actually like a barback or bus boy. I'm you know, you've never been to Alaska like he had, you don't know",
