Topic four: Leave your topic for this big beautiful show just like Ilean did. Nope, that's the wrong question. Ilean Gonzalez. It's exactly what I was thinking. Your mid says, \"Dear Kinda Funny crew, for me, the original PS2 launch game Summoner was an amazing game. While I had always played games before, this was the first game I lost myself in. After beating Summoner, I realized that gaming was more than just a passing fancy. There was that there was never and that there was no going back. That I was a gamer now.\" What's the game that made you a gamer? Thanks. So, this is a different question than what's the first game you ever played. Yeah, yeah, I know. I know. I always go, \"I mean it's a tired story for me,\" but I always talk about Metal Gear on PlayStation right and the fact that like Story Goes that I had it in '64 and I had consoles before then.",

When you're talking about Secret of Mana and Secret of Evermore, and Lufia, and, you know, obviously Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, and I mean there's a lot of those kinds of games on there that scratched at similar itches even better than Final Fantasy II does, but I think that was the one. So I'd point to Castlevania II, I'd point to Dragon Warrior games, and I'd point to... uh... Final Fantasy IV. I have a really weird answer, but I've got to go with Paperboy. No, that's not a weird answer because I think that game... you know, I played the Mario games before then, and they were amazing, and stuff, and I loved them, I enjoyed them a lot, but there's something about Paperboy that because it is just one of those arcadey like get",

And then it just more and more happens \u2013 you get to Tuesday, and then the Grim Reaper comes out. Like, what the **** is this? I think the moment when we became gamers is when we started coming up with background stories for these characters; we started thinking about like why that kid was running across the street, who was driving the red car, why the Grim Reaper was coming.

I think adventure games taught me that I should always go up to door knobs and try to touch him with the banana to see you know because adventure games are dumb; they're old adventure games really dumb. Kev this is an interesting question that I, I'm excited to hear what you guys have to say. icy Flames 96 says hey Tim Colin and Greg, is it possible that the Ratchet & Clank reimagining might be in some danger because of its release window? First off, at PSX in April 12th, the release date for the game was announced, which is the same day Dark Souls 3 comes out. Also Uncharted 4 was pushed back to April 26, which is two weeks after Ratchet & Clank releases; these two factors will definitely hurt its sales to some extent but how",

Whenever I find a game I'm really into, I'll play it non-stop until completed and then have no reason to continue playing. I feel like this might be lessening my experience and causing games to be forgotten all too soon. PS for Colin, this is also true when reading books for me. What about you? Uh, no, I with books sometimes, but with games, I actually play them pretty slow, um, a few hours at a time. I usually don't play games for more than a few hours at a time; it's just not... I used to when I was younger, I'd play games all day, um, but I just don't want to do that anymore, so um, so no.

Like when Arrow first started, I watched one episode, this isn't for me, and then season two was amazing; everybody was saying that, and they were all available right on demand, and I sat there and plotted through season one, and then bought all the rest. And now that you do the same thing with like Jessica Jones, where Jessica Jones four episodes in, I was like, \"Nick, this is I don't like this.\" He's like, \"Stick with it,\" and then it was like, watch two more, holy crap, let's watch five more this night, you know what I mean?

Whereas with four, I was so as a fan, as a fanboy of Metal Gear Solid, I was like, \"I love this; I don't want it to end,\" and I knew it was going to be told, so I had to pace myself. I'm like, \"I'm limiting it to one act a night; I cannot play more than that or else I'm just going to be done, and it's going to be over.\" So, I think there's us to their advantage, you know what I mean? Back to the last of his example, right, like that was a tear... I'm playing, and I want to consume this; I love it so much. And then they force you to slow down, right, with the giraffe scene.

Yeah, final question for the day Vis says do you think let's plays hurt game sales? Many people began using let's plays as an alternative to buying and playing games, especially with smaller titles. Do you think this is harmful for the industry as a whole or does the additional advertisement of Let's Plays help increase the game sales?
