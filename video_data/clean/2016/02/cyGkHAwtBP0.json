Very not not excited, especially especially it's not it's not the 20th anniversary one that was relevant to us either because when I when I first saw that I was like yeah it's not been 20 years really, you know, not for us, not yeah, for G and Japan, Pok\u00e9mon Green and stuff like that. Yeah, whatever though. I mean so '98 was is like the real birth of it to me at least. Um but you **** it, I'll celebrate 20 years, it's it's funny I recorded a video yesterday where I was talking about my Pok\u00e9mon memories which you should too using hash pookemon 20 and uh I was talking about it I was like yeah it's crazy it's been in my life for 20 years then I was I'm 26 now I was six I was like that's not right wait a second when did you first hear about Pok\u00e9mon then I was eight okay yeah '98 is when I came out here the Pok\u00e9mon is um was awesome I have I have a lot of memories of",

I was really, really obsessed with it, uh, when I was in high school, um, for periods of time, uh. 1998-99 Game Boy Pocket, um, and uh, remember sitting with my friend Cody, who's a buddy of mine from Long Island, and we had the Link cable, and we used to just play all the time. I used to **** Hammer them. I remember I used to just like destroy him. You suck, Cody. Um, but we used to just sit at his kitchen table like all day and just grind and play and order food and go to the supermarket and just get food and go through our bad batteries that we would go through constantly because you know of course for all the young listeners out there we didn't have rechargeable batteries on those.

No right, Diamond - there's only been one generation after that. Yeah, okay, so that's the last one I played and it because it's just it literally is the same thing over and over again; it's it's not there's literally nothing. I'm totally wrong what am I talking about? There was Black 2 and White after that, and then X and Y, Black and White 2, and then I didn't play through them. So Diamond one's the last one I played um which was I think 2009 or so probably 2010.

You get addicted to it, but it's I would love to see them actually make any make some huge changes, but at the same time people are scared to change, and that's what the spin-offs are for. And I think Pok\u00e9mon has had so many spin-offs that have had some great games, Pok\u00e9mon Snap, yeah, and oh definitely where is another snap? All these other things they're just they're great, and nothing touches the core games though. And I think that we've had a couple console RPG Pok\u00e9mon games, but they were never quite the same thing; it's not what we wanted, but that's the example of them doing something different, so like Pok\u00e9mon uh Colosseum and Pok\u00e9mon XD: Gale of Darkness or whatever the GameCube games, like those were RPGs, they're really",

The hook of collecting things reaches so deep into our psyche as Gamers I think cuz we like to collect things, I think as Gamers we like Collectibles, we like Intel, we like yeah we like to just find things and and we like to collect games and put them on our shelves and we like collectible card games and we like **** all these things and I think that just it just it just resonated with us and I think that you know specifically the people around my age that hit at the perfect time, like if you didn't like",

They're updating that uh so that you don't need a Link cable and you can uh just do it wirelessly over Wi-Fi, which is crazy. You can battle over Wi-Fi like what the **** that's I didn't realize they're adding that until I was like look researching last night.

I saw I saw the first three; that was it, okay? Um, they're releasing those just digitally in HD. Um, they're doing a whole new Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game like expansion called Generations that focuses on more the old school ones that we grew up with. There's also a mythical Pok\u00e9mon collection so it's all the fancy ones like Mew and Celebi and all that stuff.
