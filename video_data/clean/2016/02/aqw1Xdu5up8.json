Twitter, um, now we talked about Twitter before, what's the angle this time? Well, Twitter is kind of like falling apart in a corporate way and uh the um what, no I'm just freaking out because I love Twitter. I do too, um, but I want to talk to you guys about there's like this notion, this idea, you know, to catch people up: like Twitter's had a lot of turnover in the executive areas of Twitter. Twitter's stock has fallen dramatically on the market about this new timeline layout, yeah they're making changes to kind of keep Twitter relevant and what surprises me is that I find Twitter to have the most utility and the most use, I think it's like the most diverse thing: like people like well why don't you use Instagram and because like why would I use Instagram? Like it doesn't...I'm not saying there's anything wrong with Instagram, saying like it's just pictures words.",

Well, Twitter lets you write things underneath but like the idea of Instagram was pictures or with Vine, it's just these short clips of videos or Periscope as live video, whatever. It's like I can just kind of fold these things in, you know. Um, Twitter, like has everything you want on Twitter. I mean, I still think Twitter is just the most useful and the most compact and I find it has the most utility. I agree, um, I disagree... you but what I'm saying is if you know there's this notion that Twitter can go away or disappear and my whole thing is you know the people talk about Myspace and I'm like well Myspace is way different because um Myspace was eclipsed by something",

And the versatility with all of them is is really high, and it's just different - it's a different lens to look through. All the different things. Do you think Twitter's going away anytime soon? No, definitely not. I I think they're I think all of them - all of the ones we were talking about - are here to stay for a long time.

So like that site has changed significantly. I think Facebook's kind of getting a little out of control, but it's so ubiquitous that it's never going to go anywhere, and that was like kind of what I was wondering: if Twitter is really the only other social network that really isn't going to ever go anywhere because it's just too ingrained, and more than that, it's too useful. You know, that's the thing that I talk about with Twitter a lot is that I just think it has exceptional utility as it is right now, and if they don't mess with it too much, it could stay that way, but it could also be ruined; it's like kind of a Razor's Edge where you start messing around with the timeline, you start messing around with how much people can say on it, and brevity.",

I think the facts get to the facts. No, I always talk about it when Twitter turned the corner for me because I remember not... I mean, I don't even know when Twitter even came around - we want to say 2006, I think? We used to say so yeah but no one knew what to do with Twitter until I remember when I was at IGN in the early days or whatever, when they set up their Twitter and that was the thing where we all tweeted to it. You wrote an article, we all signed into IGN's Twitter and would just tweet out the link or whatever right?
