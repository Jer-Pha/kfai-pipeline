And it would mean the world to me if you went and voted for me, of course. Every time we win one of these things, it's a win for Kinda Funny, and it's a win for you because we get to go there and be like, \"Hey, people who've never heard of us - guess what? People like us!\" And everybody goes, \"Who are you?\" And they go, \"Maybe I want to be best friends with them.\" Or they're jerks, and they say, \"We'll stay away from everybody.\" So if you go to KindaFunny.com/SXSW INV vote Greg Miller for Most Entertaining Online Personality, I would take it as a personal favor that I will never ever be able to repay you for. Colin, yes - what's your topic? Let me take you on a walk... Oh yeah, take my phone out. It's gonna be another juicy topic, isn't it? That last one was 45 minutes.

It's against it - it's not an American really tradition, but there's always been socialist elements and communist elements in the United States um and that's fine that's your right to be a socialist or a communist I'm not calling Socialist Communist by the way, but what I saw this image going around today was on this hashtag socialism checklist and this is because you know basically there was a virtual tie in Iowa and Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton both walked away with you know delegates and they're going to go to New",

So where's the threshold I want yeah time out and read your definition of socialism so this is what this is what socialism actually means and this is why we have to have definitions of words you can't just walk around call yourself Socialist or say socialism is something this is what socialism actually means and you're not allowed to have your own opinion like your own definition of it it's just not the way it works it's a now a political and economic theory of social organization that Advocates the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole so it is a spin-off of the idea of",

This is a few steps away from that, basically saying we, the people or the government control the means of production, which isn't a reality in the United States or in most socialist countries in the world. Is or is not? It is not. I mean, there are certain European countries that are quote-unquote socialists; yeah, there's a lot of them that practice tenets of socialism.

But just because the government spends money on something doesn't make it socialism, so I wanted to dispel this notion first of all that that socialism - that's not socialism; that's really not a very smart thing to say. Well then what is it? Socialism is the idea... no, not socialism. What they're saying these are these things are more like part of the social contract; it's part of the functions of a government, you know what I mean - like right, that's the whole point of having a government, right?

FDR ran away from the term \"socialist.\" People called what he did socialism, and what he was doing were pieces of socialism. The New Deal was a socialist program, but he wasn't proud; he wasn't on the pulpit talking about how he was a socialist. And Obama, as we all know, certainly ran away from that term at a thousand miles an hour, and if he didn't, he would have lost. So people need to kind of like reevaluate those things in but what I'm more curious about with you guys is and and our view out there who have you know a lot of different opinions depending on where they are and everything do you believe in the tenants of socialism and do you think that those going to work in the United States and what I mean by that is should",
