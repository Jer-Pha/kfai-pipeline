We're talking about the fact that all of our dreams are coming true in the DC TV Universe, ladies and gentlemen. I'm here with not so breaking news but a whole bunch of insight for you on the fact that Grant Gustin, yes, the Flash from CW, is coming to Melissa Benoist's Supergirl show on CBS. Not enough people are talking about this. I did it on Colin first off, Colin didn't put it on Colin Live, our new show each and every day on Twitch.tv/Ofun Games. Uh, and it's this is huge, this is huge, it is. I even know this; I don't watch the DC TV Universe stuff but I know that up until now Supergirl has kind of been its own side thing, but this was more of a will it won't it type situation.

Now you might ask why am I grabbing at the notepad? Yeah, why are you grabbing the notepad? You know that I know all these facts because there's some people that need to get taken to task. Number one, Entertainment Weekly (ew.com) - you do fantastic work and I like a lot of your things; don't get me wrong.

They don't they don't get into it, it's not too deep, they don't get into the weeds like Flash there's not people putting up the like the pins and the strings trying to figure everything out with that show. Yeah okay that's one way we say I don't know okay sure um so clearly What's Happening Here is that they are not in the same Universe, they are very clearly in the Multiverse. You are a DC fan out there if you're watching and you you've struggled along this far you know as well as I do the Multiverse infinite Earths all these different things happening of course right now this season of Flash they are dealing with the Multiverse season two they have all these different portals open to different universes or whatever Earth",

It's conceivable perhaps too easy to assume that one of these Universal portals leads over to Supergirl's Universe where we're going to go over to National City see Catco Media see what's happening. Do I think that's the case? Yeah, I do. I think that's because I... I think that's the easiest solution to it and not only is it the easiest, it's the solution that makes the most sense. Now here's Tim where it gets very very exciting because if they introduce this fact, this now means that let's let's lay it down from this thing okay March 28th comes and goes, March 20th we wake up, we open Variety as I believe it still probably comes in a paper even though we look at Doom and we go oh my.",

PS, that Lana Lang no we don't need a great great woman in this universe. I assume from what I've seen uh of Kristen Kreuk but like we don't need her in this universe. Erica Durance is perfect.

That's Casper's whole thing - they want to get you the mattresses you need for better nights and brighter days. That's their whole thing. One two meow. So if you're interested, go to casper.com/kindafunny and use the code \"kindafunny\" to get $50 towards any mattress. You have 100 days to return it no questions asked. Thank you. Here's what I want to float out there: Mr. Berlanti, I understand you don't want to follow me on Twitter - that's fine. If you don't want to follow me on Twitter, no big deal. Here's the deal: I'm willing to offer you... I'll fly myself to Vancouver to be an extra in the very back of Justice League, just to have a cup of coffee and a Flash cappuccino. You won't even be able to tell it's me - I'll be blurry in the background.",
