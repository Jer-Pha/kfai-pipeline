I don't know why, like it's just like there's like a part of me that really desperately needs your approval. Okay, we might need to use that for the cold actually, that'll be perfect for the topic. Okay, so Trisha, Nick, today we have a question from 17-year-old Bart. Bart says, \"Hey, Nick and Tim and Trisha,\" he didn't know you, that's okay. I started my senior year of high school a few weeks ago, and in one of my classes, I sit opposite this really pretty girl. We talk a bunch, and she gives me some come-hither vibes. But how do I know if she likes me? She laughs at my amazing pun jokes, and is interested in my boring lectures. So, is that a good sign? What can I do to show her that I'm interested in her? We make eye contact and smile a bit; however, I'm not sure how effective that is. I mean, I've always used the age-old uh practice of just saying \"Hey, I like you. We should hang out.\" It generally gets you the answer.",

Yeah, try to try to take the um, try to take all the weight off of the situation by thinking it's not a big deal if the shoe doesn't fit - there's lots of other shoes to try on. So don't put all the importance on if she says yes or no that determines my entire self, true. That's not the case at all. Don't be impressive, just be you, and either she'll be the right shoe for you or she won't. But it's better to know than not to know. If only it was like online shoe shopping, like how my wife does it, where she orders like 15 different pairs and then picks which one she wants and sends the rest back - wouldn't that be much easier? Like, that's exactly what Tinder is, you can try it, and that's kind of like what The Bachelor and The B shows are, just bring a bunch of people together.",

Yeah, you're in a great situation right now where you're in school and you're young and this is like all new fresh experiences so just have fun, just learn, just kind of try different things out and see what sticks. Yeah, and if she's giving you the eye contact and the smile like you said in your question that's a good sign, she's laughing at your jokes that's a good sign, you guys talk a lot that's a good sign. What are some other good signs? What should we be looking for as dudes? Um well overly long eye contact to the point where it feels a little bit awkward that's a good sign, and extra smiles for no reason that's a good sign, and if you're leaving each other and you're saying goodbye you",

And if you're leaving each other and you're saying goodbye, you've won too many goodbyes again. If it's awkward, that's usually good in my experience. If she fiddles with her keys, kiss her; that's what that is, that's a yes. She fiddles with her keys 'cause then the lady says, \"Okay, I know it's time to go now, but I'm just going to take a little extra time standing here with you to see if maybe you'll make a move.\" Oh, oh, oh, did I drop them? Let me try again. Just trying to find my car keys. If that's happening, that means please make a move. Don't do a grand gesture with it; okay, don't do the thing where like you cover her car in rose petals. You have Kevin, like hold up a sign, that's just yes or no, and then she has to like throw a water balloon at one of them. Just for the love of God, wait for a good moment when you two are alone, and be like, \"You know what I like\"",

I have a really important question for you though - this whole studying thing... okay, like or the Netflix and chill, oh n' chill, is that a good approach? I don't like the Netflix and chill approach personally; okay, just because I like there to be a little bit of effort put into it, not just like, \"Hey, I'm sitting on my couch already. I'm going to call you up and ask if you want to come sit on my couch with me.\" Shows no effort on either part, whether the lady calls or the guy calls. Now that being said, once you've had your first couple dates, and you're in that like sweet spot, Netflix and chill is what it's all about exactly, but not right in the beginning.
