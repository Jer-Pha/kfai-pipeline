I had this weird anxiety when I was going to walk through the door for the first time to this new relationship, this new life. And I walked in, got up the balls to actually like open the door, go get a taco and I went and I walk into the apartment and nothing changed. Honestly, if you're in a good relationship with someone and you guys have an actual healthy relationship where you know you can talk and communicate and figure stuff out together, and nothing will change when you guys actually move in. I think the biggest adjustment I had um when you know I first started living with my wife was trying to you know realize that even though we're spending time together cuz we're you know we're living together, that it's okay to go and do something without the other person at like at the time",

Like I don't know if you've noticed that in your relationship, but when you're just sitting there watching TV and she's reading a magazine and you're just you know hanging out on the internet and something's on that's fun, it's relaxing, but it's not the same as you guys sitting together having dinner talking about your days like actually decompressing and remembering that you love each other and you're in each other's lives or like engaging in an actual uh conversation as opposed to just like talking right, like, small talk, right. And so that's that's the craziest thing is like my wife and I have to actually sit down and turn the TV off get a meal together and talk to each other and it sounds stupid to say but that's very, very, very important well in terms of the space stuff then like do you think it's important to have a a man cave style thing going",

The other thing I would touch on though is that figuring out there's a lot of different logistics stuff you have to figure out when you're with a roommate, you can have that hard conversation, but it's different when you're with your wife - finances are a big thing and they're a huge point of stress where people in relationships so have those conversations now start hashing that stuff out now who's going to pay what cuz at the end of the day it does boil down to that like and it can kill some of the romance and it sucks but you just got to get through that talk about the",
