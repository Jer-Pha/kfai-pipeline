As of recording this today, they announced, and I read it on Giant Bomb.com. Oh, I've heard of that place. This Austin Walker fell writing up news and stuff over there. They announced that on top of this already being a weird E3 with no EA, no Activision, uh, no Disney - that's a different one - they're now doing this public one right next door at LA Live. There's this public thing where you can go where kids can go. They already sold out of tickets on the first two days or whatever. It was free. It was free. You just had to go. Sorry. My free but they are they're full up. They were doing it in sessions. So they were doing two sessions a day. Uh so like it was what uh noon to 5 and 5 to 10 p.m. when you went to go sign up for it. By the time I looked at it, like an hour after they announced it, almost all of them were already all booked up. Now, what's interesting in",

Now, what's interesting in Austin's article on Giant Bomb, he puts out that that said, the list of attending companies is a bit of a weird mix that definitely skews toward general games culture more than development. Uh, so far on board for this public E3 thing is Alienware, Facebook, Oculus, Dell (assuming \"Fredo\" was a typo), Lenovo (assuming \"Lelay\" was a typo), HTC Vive, Loot Crate, Monster, Twitch, Ubisoft, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. He needs an and in there to finish that sentence, by the way. You can call him about that later. I'll put it in. Uh, what the hell? What the hell's going on with E3 this year? Well, I mean, EA pulled out and wanted to do its own thing and they're letting the public into that. They're they're even doing a simultaneous event in London at the same time. That's what simultaneous means. Yes. Um and so, you",

Yeah, definitely. But I mean, for going forward, do you think there's room for that. I think that with I hope that's not their complete list of exhibitors. Yeah. Uh but also I don't know who else would get on board. I Interesting. You didn't see the first parties there, right? Where was Sony? Where was this? Exactly. Like you have to imagine that like this thing probably got announced as late as it has because they were probably trying to rope more companies into it and this is the list they had at the deadline that they probably needed to announce.

Oh, god. I hope so. I bet Disney would have done really well at something like that. But, you know, Disney wasn't going to have a booth at E3 either, you know, before all this Infinity stuff got got yanked. So, uh, so they probably, the ESA probably had to look at things and go like, okay, well, if the show is not meeting the needs of our constituents, what can we do to the show to try to make it more appealing to them? Uh, that's my guess as to how this went. And then you, you know, you bring in a company like Activision to sponsor the whole thing or whatever. You get some bands, you do some stuff.

Uh, and and there you have it. Uh, I don't know how it'll go. I'm I'm interested to see it, but like, you know, E3 is not as big of a deal anymore for a lot of reasons, for some of the same reasons that the like traditional video game press is not as relevant as it used to be because everyone is cutting those types of things out of the loop. you know, you have a company like EA just speaking directly to its audience or speaking to them through like influencers or something. Um, and as a result, like the idea of like, hey, let's let's go spend a ton of money on this E3 booth, build this huge thing that'll hold all these people, and then the only people we're going to let in are like what's left of the video game press and then like managers for video game stores and whoever else could scam a ticket to E3.

Every blogger, right? I got a blog. Yeah. So, and so at some point it's like, well, why do that when you could just spend that same amount of money or maybe a little bit more? They need to get a building and all that other stuff and just put on a public event. Like, it makes sense for a company like EA with a lineup the size that they have to do something like that. Well, I mean, it's, you know, and this obviously we hosted it, but I think the Final Fantasy Versus XIII event was a good thing, too, right? Of like, yeah, sure, we could go and have the Square Enix press conference during E3, but are we we don't get the headlines? We don't get the space. Whereas when they did it on their own, right, it was for that day in our echo chamber all anyone talked about. And same thing with PSX where you get to own a news cycle to yourself, so",

PSX I mean, you know, they they kind of have their smaller announcements at PSX and and do still have their big stuff at E3, but I I don't think it's going to need to be that way forever, right? You know, Sony's establishing its own presence. Microsoft will probably eventually want to do something similar. Yeah, I assume that Xbox will will do their own thing as well. I think this is smart. I think this is and this is emblematic I think of a larger issue which is there are too many shows and these publishers and developers are spread way too thin and you have to start really identifying the ones that matter the most and I think that I mean when we were at IGN I was saying for a long time that because of the public nature of Gamescom",

So it gets the headlines of well we have our little press conferences on all these things but the people that are really like the smaller YouTubers or bloggers and obviously the websites go and then people hundreds of thousands of people getting their hands on these games then kind of start to chatter especially with VR which I think is really important. So I think E3 is dying and I think that I think that it's not going to go away. I think it's just going to have to evolve or change because in the age of packs um in the age of even something smaller like RTX in the age of um something like Paris Games Week or Gamescom you have to start to pick and choose and you saw",

Like Sony was just straight up like we're not going to Gamescom and everyone's like what the hell are you talking about? But there they don't have there's just not enough content to justify being at every one of these shows. And so I think that um you know E3 is sorry I like that **** E3 is a little bit of a nightmare scenario. And they're in a they're in a bad they're in a bad place because you're right, with the waning influence of traditional press means that E3 just isn't going to be as important anymore. And we were even talking, I mean, we're going to go to E3, but we were talking for a long time about do we even have to go?

Exactly. And and so we are right here. We were all in games media a long time ago and we know that like bomb does it too. The the gate the gatekeepers were it was important to have the gatekeepers that were like I'm at the demo and here's what I'm seeing and this is but now you have streaming and now you have YouTubers and influencers and now you have just word of mouth and you believe the commenter in the comments more than you believe the person that's writing the actual article on on site X.

Yeah. And I think that you know, like to me it's kind of crazy that uh the first parties haven't just said you know what we're going to just actually just launch our own like constant video programming on our consoles themselves. You know, obviously like, you know, like Larry does the Major Nelson stuff for Xbox. Like, you know, Sony has its blog, but that stuff doesn't necessarily filter onto the console itself. You're talking about another core. You want to bring back Xbone, and I'm all about it, brother. Yeah. Spell it with a Q.

Obviously, it's coming from the company itself, so it's not news. Everything's great. Yeah, it's all the best. These games are all great. Uh, just you should probably buy them all. Click here. Uh but you know like we I'm surprised they aren't taking better advantage of that kind of direct relationship. Uh and and I think that that's that's probably where this all ends up for absolutely for everyone eventually. It's just and what we're talking about are these, you know, monolithic corporations trying to turn that wheel. And I think that's where you get into you see it with all these companies where you ask for a statement and it's got to be bounced around like PR to this person to this team to get let's bounce it to Japan and see what they say.

It's I think I think you're right in the sense that like you see it with Sony already. I think Sony's actually like kind of delegitimizing its Tokyo base and actually putting everything now in the West because they realize with we already saw the Canyong Nine with PS4 launching in the United States first. They're like, \"We're not launching in Japan. We're not launching simultaneous. We're launching in our biggest market because that's what makes sense regardless of the monolithic nature of our old corporation.\" Um, and I agree with you.

And I do feel like there's a little bit of a gunshyness specifically what we're talking about with digital sales about why not just charge less for digital games and then you just drive. But they can't because they can't alienate people that are selling their hardware. They can't alienate their audience and I actually think there might be a little bit of that where they're like why not have a show every day on PlayStation Network even. And like well we don't we're not quite ready to put the gun barrel against the head of traditional media yet. Maybe we'll do that in a few years when but we have to kind of still play nice. I do think that that's probably starting to factor into the arithmetic as well, but you still see it with Activision's blog and Ubisoft's blog and EA's blog where they're just like not even",

Like I think you, you we all know how much it takes to make something even this crappy looking, right? Like the work and the time it takes. So for Sony to sit there and be like, \"Oh, like that.\" Like the blog was and Activision's blog, all those were the first steps and that's catching up to what we knew print media or digital media was. Yeah. I mean, four years ago, EA was interviewing themselves and putting it up on YouTube and no one was watching. Now they have 800,000 people or however many watching the Battlefield reveal and it looks like they shot it in a closet, you know, like it looked terrible, but no one cares because it had the trailer in it and that's what people actually wanted to see.

So you throw in an ad market that is steadily crumbling and it gets harder and harder to make your revenue targets as these big monolithic video game websites and all this other stuff. At some point you're like, you know what, we're gonna double down on the things that people actually want to read. And so, you know, that's like two of EA's games and but they've got eight more.

So I just got to sit in this restaurant and it was air conditioned. It was on the pier, go get corn dogs whenever I needed them and they just brought all the games to us. So I went to that airplane hanger for like 10 minutes to play Burnout and then left. Yeah. And and that was the best. Uh but yeah, that was that was the E3 that everyone looked at and said, \"Oh, we need to bring E3 back because there's not enough pomp and circumstance.\" Uh the mainstream media, which at the time, you know, I think a lot of publishers thought they wanted, uh they still do to to whatever extent, but uh they didn't care because it didn't look like this big spectacle anymore.

You know, like those sorts of news stories uh mattered to a certain extent, but you can get your mainstream coverage other ways. Nintendo used to always like, you know, they'd make their announcements at E3, but USA Today would have it three hours before their press conference. They can still go to USA Today and say, \"Uh, hey, here's our new console. You should run it on the front page.\" And USA Today probably will.

Well, this is I mean for Nintendo this E3 is like very interesting because it was like, \"Hey everybody, shut up. No NX Zelda non-stop period. That's it. We'll see you in a few months.\" That to me like Yeah. That that to me just says that they don't want to lose their booth space because if you give up your booth space on the floor, someone else gets it. And if you want to come back in the following year, you're at the back of the line. Nintendo would probably be a little closer to the front of the line. Sure. But you get my point. Like that, you know, that's why Konami had their big black box on the show floor a couple years ago with like zero games in it. They're like, \"Well, someday we might want",

No. Bring them. I mean, I don't know. We sell them. They do quite well. Um, Health Club. You want to maybe learn about Nobody wants to. Okay, cool. Uh, so, you know, that sort of stuff. E3 is changing, but the nature of being a video game publisher in 2016 has changed so much from what it was 5 years ago. Also with, you know, mobile and just the constant slew of open betas and just like people have greater access to broken builds of games than they've ever had before.

The space was too big for the amount of people there. So, it was like it looked a little empty and I'm like this is not Vegas isn't the right look for the show. This space isn't the right look for the show. And then PSX at Moscone was totally different. And I think that they kind of nailed the tempo. They nailed the the breadth of of what they want to do. And they had some good announcements there as well. I mean, it wasn't like E3 scale every single time, but like it was a good it was the right level of announcements that you you would want to have for this PlayStation focused show.\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n* \"producer\" is already capitalized and correct\n* No phonetic mistakes or spelling errors were found in the chunk\n* I added capitalization to proper nouns:\n\t+ PSX (PlayStation Experience)\n\t+ Moscone (referring to the Moscone Center in San Francisco)",

I mean, it wasn't like E3 was scaled every single time, but like it was at the right level of announcements that you'd want to have for this PlayStation focused show. And that's the thing is like getting understanding the audience you're talking to. Whereas like you save your marquee, let's get in USA Today stuff for E3, but then you do get to come out and have Geoff Keighley come out and be like, \"Hey, here's seven new VR games.\" And we're all like, \"Yeah.\" And everyone's just excited to see him. Like, look at that jersey. What hockey jersey he's wearing today? Oh. Um, yeah. Like that that stuff's great. It's great that they've been able to do that sort of stuff. But, you know, I think yeah, the E3 press conferences are the things that matter. And for better or worse, the media started broadcasting them on television, all this other stuff.

Yeah, they all they all got bigger than they should have become in a weird way. And, and now seeing it kind of maybe start to come back down makes some sense. I think it's it's rubber banding again in the way of like the amount of press people that go to these are like, can you turn off the music? Can I just hear can you talk to me? Can I not scream over the game? What's happen? Like, you know, that's the E3 I want. Just like how we always talk about though, that's the industry party we want, right? We just walk in like, \"Oh, there's really lowkey music and we're just chilling and it's brightly lit and I can talk to you and see you and this is great.\" Uh, yes. Oh, there's corn dogs. Awesome.

You know, the Atlanta years were strange in their own way. Uh, and the whole thing grew out of CES and you know CES was really great because there were a ton of great Super Nintendo games there, but also car stereos. Uh, but also video games were in a tent and it was in Vegas in January. They just had this big huge heated tent full of SNES games. This is like 92. Uh, and uh, the games just got treated with zero respect. So at some point it was like we are going to put on our own show because CES actually kind of hates that we're here.

There's still a reason to have something called E3 and those press conferences are still always a big deal. But the bulk of the news is over Tuesday morning when that last press conference happens Sunday night. Now I guess so weird about it. And back to our conversations about like, well, do we go? Do we just cuz it last year you figure we had 3 days of coverage on GameSpot. There were interviews and reactions and we saw zero games. We put zero games on. We did zero let's plays. It didn't need it. And our the content that performed the best. Cisco was there. I mean, yeah, don't worry. I'm not putting down what we did. We did good content.

Exactly. Like seeing the rest of that sequence, it was Yeah. It was nice to get on a podcast and go like, \"Oh man, actually, they probably should have showed that whole thing because the back half of it was the actual awesome part.\" Um, but I think they got what they wanted out of that where they got a bunch of people coming out of it going like, \"You're not going to believe what they showed me.\" Which is all they really want.

Yeah. I mean that's you know the thing I said when everyone started pulling out is like as long as like you know they'll give us a couch and a camera like I'll go down there and put on our show.

What do you What are you shaking your head at? Why don't you like Stephen? No, I did this. I don't expect you to put up a lower third. Steven didn't pay for the lower third. All right.
