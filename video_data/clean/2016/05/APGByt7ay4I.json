It is so I would say start with the stomach line okay or if she's turned over maybe the back line somewhere on that line and see how she responds to it. Here's the thing though - little-known fact, actually a lot of people might know this - it's actually very good for the skin, so know that you know if you want to have nice skin on your wrists over there I would say just go for the face. See here's my thing I feel like you shouldn't just go for any of this stuff like I feel like even the stomach even the lower back even all of that stuff you should at least have a conversation about it of like, \"Hey, what's your comfort level with?\" I think on this one this is the one time where I'm going to say no. I think this - the surprise of it can be like a big turn on like especially especially if there's again the Navy SEALs",

Nick, have you ever experienced this? I've never had a facial now, I mean, I've had a facial and like trying when they go and they like pluck out your pores, but I've never had some facialist deliver a facial. Oh, that's what you're talking about, uh, yeah, I have in the past, and she, and that was one of those times where she actually asked for it and I was like, \"Who am I to deny this person what they want?\" Well, she just came on my face, yeah, she was like, \"I want you to\" and I'm like, \"Okay, well, we'll do. I'm here to serve.\" Yeah, I think let's go with The Generation that the generation that we are growing up in now, we're porn is just a thing that is our life some over there. I feel like things have changed you know, like Nick, I think your generation was a little bit different where that that was a little bit more... well it wasn't.",
