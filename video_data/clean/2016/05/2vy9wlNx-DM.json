Now, but to sit there is like this is a game where there's all these ramifications on the choices and the actions of before, and suddenly we're left with this; it's a somber Uncharted. And it's not to say the humor isn't there; it's not to say the characters aren't there; it's not to say the things you don't love and connect with Uncharted aren't there. But there's also this weight to it, and you know what I mean - like we've talked it's been shown before or whatever of like Nate setting out on this journey and like how much does he really want to be on it and stuff like that, and I feel it as a player, and it's a very interesting thing.

I think that the game knows its strengths and it focuses on them, and I think that in a way even better than two or three did; one had its issues, two or three are both great games but I think that three really tried to do something different with the whole backstory and like the slower boring parts, I think this one nailed it, this one really did it. It's to say that it's slower, I still think that it's very well paced; I think that the pacing of this game is it's the the I can only give it the highest praise to be clear when I'm saying it was slower and the ramp and the build and all that stuff I was never bored in any section it's slower in the way that I mean I feel",

But there are parts of the maps where I'm like, \"I went too far, and I can't go back\" because I missed this entire section of these branching paths. And I was like, \"That looks like the main path,\" but nope; that's what this is. The game has been broadened, um, and I think that's not a bad thing. But also, doesn't that make the combat more dynamic, which I think is cool?

In the monster closet, here's some climbing; monster closet, here's some climbing over and over and over. Right. And uh, I think two really kind of introduced the idea of a little bit more verticality of climbing while fighting. Um, and then three kind of widened it out a bit. This one takes all of that and puts it together - during the monster closet parts where you're fighting a whole bunch of people, there are 10 different ways you can go about it, and it feels awesome. It honestly feels better than any of the other Uncharted games. I think. I think in terms of like, I always felt perfectly in control whether it was melee or gunplay.

And that excitement was lost to me this time when I was coming down the hill - I'm like, \"Oh man, Bruce was driving better than I was.\" Ah, crap, I hit okay, now this is gonna happen, that's it, it's over.

That's not quite the way Uncharted was played in the past, so I think the game needed to tell you that a little bit. They do a great job of it when you get out after you beat it and you come back and go through your chapters - it'll show you how many Treasures journal entries, optional conversations, and I like that point.
