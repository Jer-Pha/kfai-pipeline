But then the thing was, I drove from Las Vegas to San Francisco; that's a longer drive, two days, 11 hours. We stopped a few times and... um, yeah. But it's really weird for me driving because we drive on the other side of the road, on the other side of the car. So I'm driving along, especially at night, and I'm like, holy ****; it's turning different. Have you had a lot of close calls? No, no, no.

So, they're in like the middle of nowhere. Middle of nowhere makes sense. Makes sense. So it's not like Costa Rica where you could literally just be hanging out and there's a howler monkey up in a tree. They're not just like rats. They're not in the street. If they are in the street, you're... um, cuz you... cuz if you hit them with your car, your car's... and so are you, really? Yeah, don't know. How big are we talking? Kar no, they're as big as me.

A car could take that little koala, but the worst part, the worst thing that you'll hit in Australia in regards to wildlife is a wombat. Oh really? Yeah, a wombat. So, a wombat - they're what's this big and when they hit the ground, that's it, they're done. They're not moving anywhere. So, they're not like pigeons where you think you've nailed them, you swear to God, I nailed that pigeon, but you look back and it's flying away, flipping you off. It's not like that. No, no. If you hit a wombat, you know about it - it'll break an axle. You'll know about it. And same with the kangaroo. If you hit a kangaroo, you know about it because it's in your windshield.

So there's two types of koalas: there's the koalas and there's drop bears. Drop bears aren't real; don't fall for this, don't fall for this. They always try to get us with this. So you got the koalas - they're the cute, cuddly ones you get in the zoo, and your hug and your pat them. They eat eucalyptus; they eat gum gum leaves. And then the drop bears - at your face. I don't like those; those are the mean ones. **** those guys; they're the ones that hang out in the tree, and they'll sit there watching you, and then all of a sudden you walk past it, they'll **** you up.

And then in 2013, Gallup did another one, and the numbers are going down: conservative 34%, liberal 23%, moderate 38%.

Anyone who says they remove your politics and all this stuff from you have no idea what you're talking about. You can't remove that kind of stuff from games - like the games are political, even games that aren't political are political, and you can read into all sorts of kinds of things in them. What's the same thing as the Vita? Though like no one was writing about the vita, you were so of course the audience there is the people who want to hear you talk about the Vita, so of course they're going to love it and love you for it, you know.

Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there are...I don't want because it's not about individuals; I don't want to talk about individuals. It's not about them; it's like I don't want to call anyone out. It's not about any of that. Everyone's allowed to have their own opinion; it's not their fault necessarily that they were hired into an industry that's already super liberal, and so they're going to hire super liberals, and then they're going to hire super liberals. I mean, that's the way it goes. Because I know that my politics have been held me back in this industry or whatever.
