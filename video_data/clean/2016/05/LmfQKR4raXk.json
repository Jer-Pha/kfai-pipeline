The first day is going to be a completely ridiculous stage show; what we have planned this year completely blows last year out of the water, and I don't even know how that's possible because we were really stupid last year, and this year's somehow even stupider. Day two is going to be a full day of meet and greets; we're hanging out with all of us, a bunch of Rooster Teeth people are there, Funhaus people are there, Achievement Hunter it's going to be a grand old time; there's going to be some games to play, there's going to be signings; it's it's exciting, it's a really fun time; there's going to be exclusive merch.

Well, I was like, so I started looking up statistics, and I'm like, there's got to be a statistical anomaly that explains this, and so I started going into um, this is very American-centric, which I apologize to our foreign audience; it's just like I can't account for that, and most of the people we deal with in terms of like our peers are actually Americans.

Yes, and I told you, I've said it a million times: if you ran the party, and that's what Republicans were, they'd win every election.

I want to know about what she thought of her Dark Souls book is going or what she's playing that.

You see this all the time in Hollywood, and a lot of people talk about it down there a lot. Where everyone's liberal in LA, but that can't be possible. There are clearly people who would vote Republican or people who would side with the Republicans in so far as some of what they what they stand for. But everyone's afraid or just likes being caught up with the common voice of of liberal Hollywood simply because that is that is the most popular voice down there.

Cuz I think I'm mixing my terms here a little bit, but most people that would could be considered artists would be considered free and free thinking and and you know, free acting, and that kind of goes a little bit more along with uh liberal ideology. It's certainly that in Hollywood; that's the same in the games industry. I would reckon to say there are a lot more people who are conservative in the games industry that just don't feel that they can actually voice that for fear of being jumped on, like you get jumped on every single time you tweet everything.

But I mean like so I I'm not following that just in the sense that no one ever asked me my political thoughts no, but they can feel it, they can just feel it, yeah, in the balls well then I mean in the big fat you get what the argument is no you're political no no one asks your political feelings but you're a liberal, I mean you're obviously a liberal. The the and there's nothing wrong with being a liberal my my most of my family are liberals like I'm not I have no problem with liberalism it's just not what I feel I would say Tim is a lot more libertarian than he's liberal, Tim's definitely I mean I mean he's from San Francisco and I don't mean that as as a perative like socially he's liberal but he likes",

But you know, I didn't see many people writing the kinds of articles I was writing or saying the kinds of things I was saying and but they seem so evident and when I would write them I'd be attacked by some people and I'd be attacked by a lot of people in the media but I'd get a lot of support from people that were reading it and to me that's said a lot. Where I'm like, do you just feel like no one's writing to you because because games are very political, art is political, anyone who says they they remove your politics and all",

Is there an analog on the other side for you? I mean can you think of anyone that's as political in the games industry As You Are? I can think of many, I'm not going to name names I don't want to talk about it as much as like as left as spoken yes based on my Twitter there's a couple people that are definitely seemingly anti-colon yeah absolutely I mean there are I don't want because it's not about",

Like, there's definitely something you think in the art of being a writer that draws out liberal people. Do you think it's just the locations artists are from? You think of games media as being all in San Francisco or New York City, New York, LA if you're on YouTube, right? Yeah, that's it. It could be, but that suggests the point is, wouldn't it even make more sense if it was 90/10? You can't even say that to me; that's the only point I'm trying to make. Yeah, I think it goes back to the fact that art is generally progressive. Right? Is art seen as a progressive medium, and that engenders that kind of thinking for the most part. That's a possible explanation for it. I don't know; I just thought it was interesting. This is basically just an observation. I don't know whether people agree with it or disagree with it or what.",
