Colin, don't be such a Cragin; we're experiencing The Great Outdoors, take it in the sun, the trees, the West Nile-infected mosquitoes, the man-eating bears. Oh, don't be silly, Colin; bears don't eat people; they eat honey like Winnie the Pooh. What the hell are your parents doing to you, Tim? What are you doing? I'm making a campfire so Wendy Spencer knows I can bring it. It's 85\u00b0 out here; why would you light a fire? I watched a BuzzFeed list video that outlined 17 things I can do to impress a girl. Number 16 was to be manly around her, and nothing says manly like a roaring fire. What was number 17? Make lots of money. You might want to focus more on that one, Barb. When you're done unpacking my stuff, can you bring me some sparkling water? Of course, thanks, doll balls. Why do you let them treat you like that? You and I both know there's a natural pecking order in high school; Wendy and Troy are upperclassmen.",
