But I get, and I was assuming they would kind of shoehorn Bucky in; the whole thing was going to be kind of about him, but it kind of wasn't. And I liked that. When he was in it, you actually did kind of care about him because up until this point, I didn't give a **** about Bucky. Yeah, I just didn't care like in Captain America: Winter Soldier; I was like, \"God, this character is so bad.\" But then we see them; they spend more time together, you see Bucky, he's a more fully fleshed-out character in this, and you actually start to... you're you're split because you like these characters.

It was always very tight-knit and very about propelling each of the character story lines forward in a way that didn't leap and bounds from where they started, but was you there was a starting point and an end point that made sense contextually within the movie. Sure, for me, I mean, that was my like, to me is that it was the Captain America movie. CU, I like, I'm totally hypocrite, like the people complaints people always love about Superman, I love about Captain America. I just find him and I love Chris Evans portrayal of him don't get me wrong but I find him incredibly two-dimensional and I just don't have anything I really connect with this character on other than he's fighting the good fight which I get but like",

I'm not giving them up.\" He had a senate hearing and said, \"I'm Tony Stark, I'm Iron Man now, and I'm accountable.\" We've seen character development in the last few films where he's gone through traumatic experiences. These guys are getting bombarded with stuff, but it's just weird that those roles were flipped. But I feel like what you're saying makes sense.

I mean, that's another one I would agree with you on four years ago. Like, what is taking Thanos so long to get the **** down here? Are you kidding me? I'm definitely cautiously optimistic about those two. I think this is the... where did we see Thanos was so? Is he going to be in Avengers but was he also in Guardians right?
