I have money to do things and I can do whatever I want blah blah and then you were banging out then I was with Christine again and here I am though but I'm I'm back out this is like my only second and a half time right that counts yeah of being single. I don't know what to expect Tim, do I have to start using Tinder eventually because it seems like that happens all the time? I wasn't prepared for this topic Greg.

I just want to make sure that you're not pushing things away. Now what this means is you just need to not cause issues. Did you just take off your socks? Yeah, I did. You're getting real cozy for this one. Well, I was trying to wait for a break, a very nice break in what you were saying to eyeball Colin and ask him if he knew what the Reigns from the gods would smell like.

I'm sorry, Colin. One day you'll join us, um, you know? But it's like two in big like that's nothing. You get some real stuff, you see some real stuff.

But listen to that, but that's really what it's about, and really that comes from you can't really communicate with somebody unless you know who you are, and I think that's the key thing, it's it's just when you're 33 hopefully by then you know who you are, and if you meet someone else they hopefully know who they are, and that's what helped me so much is like I met somebody that knows who she is and I know who I am",

So that's what I'm saying is like I think that that's going to be really key for you, and that's my hope for you. Do you ever find it alarming, Colin, how in like you know how it's like when a group of girls are together their periods will sync up? That like our lives are in this weird sink where like remember we both broke up with our girlfriends and moved in together, then we both got together with those girlfriends while we were together, then we both broke up with those girlfriends.
