I understand that.\" But does that really speak to what your child would want? I don't think it's necessarily wrong that well my kid loves Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and you're like, \"What's the best Ninja Turtles game on the market right now?\" And you give them that to see if they like the buttons and they like what's happening. And then start expanding their palette. Yeah, you know your child better than I do, believe it or not. And so I don't know his attention span or her attention span or how it all works out that way. That's what gets weird.

Ain to ukulele is to banjo; surely they can't have the rights to a game using Portals, and I would imagine it would sell 90% as well as an authentic Portal game if it was clearly a Portal clone. I think your numbers might be a bit off there; I don't think it'll sell 90% as well. I feel like there have been games that are similar - the woman who left Portal after Portal one, Quantum something like that (I'm almost there); where you... you oh I remember the Flashlights that they came out with; I'm going to Google but there - the answer is yes, there have been some, and it's a hard formula to nail.

Those games are obviously amazing because of the design and the philosophy behind them and all of the... it's like it's such a such a package and it's the puzzles are just pinnacles of game design so it's like just doing it again I don't think necessarily would be the right choice. I hope there's a Portal 3 that would be amazing, I would love there to be a port. Of course in Lego Dimensions, the level pack, it's a brand new Portal thing, new voice work, new stuff, new song at the end like that's highly recommended.
