The one thing I really liked about it above all else is that it's definitely not the way I thought it was gonna end. I was gonna say were you nothing nobody died, yeah, I was but we'll get we'll get in that in a minute, it um, but this to me was like okay, is a cute little way to end it, but I think the clear intent was to say like it's not necessarily over, like this is there's gonna be more, this girl might be in the new Uncharted in ten years from now, it's just a way for us to set it up and and set it forget it is Ron Popeil would say yeah, in case you wanna retire.",

In ten years, they could do it; that would be awesome at PlayStation, whatever experienced twenty sixteen or twenty out with 2026. They did come on it's...

One thing that I had a problem with in Uncharted 4 is that Elena Fisher's character, Sully, was totally unnecessary when you really think about like the plot like why she was in the plot sheet there's no reason for her to be in it at all. But that was that was like one of my major things.

Because she's not just a psychopath, which you see in the Cutthroat fights, Keane's scene at the end that he's just nuts. Um, so I just felt like I don't know, I had one issue with the plot.

They're like, I convinced myself at some point that I was proud; I was like waiting for someone to come out and get us, and then when nobody was like, \"We are alone here.\" It's I'm going, and I am picking up all these notes and reading about this marriage that's falling apart in this woman who's sacrificing her family to continue to go on these adventures. To see like her husband's last-ditch effort to have her involved with her child's life, and then the next one which is totally cold and cut off. And then the note from I think it's Sully, right? Or maybe was the child saying, \"Don't even try to send my daughter money; you're not part of her life. Don't write to me again.\"",

Well, first off, now I don't want them either way, but like last summer's I would not have wanted you could be on a wave at Croft Manor, not before I knew the context of what's happening there.
