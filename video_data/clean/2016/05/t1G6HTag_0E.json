What we have planned this year completely blows last year out of the water. And I don't even know how that's possible cuz we were really stupid last year and this year's somehow even stupider. Day two, it's going to be full day of meet and greets. We're hanging out with all of us. A bunch of Rooster Teeth people are there. Funhaus people are there. Achievement Hunter. It's going to be a grand old time. There's going to be some games to play. There's going to be signings. It's just it's exciting. It's a really fun time. There's going to be exclusive merch. Oh yeah, there's definitely going to be exclusive merch. Go to Kinda Funny.com/tickets to get your tickets today.

Obviously, Cosmopolitan catches my eye, cuz it always catches my eye. Of course, there was I don't even know what the **** it was. It was National Enquirer or some **** Next to that was Globe. Next to that was who who the hell knows? Weekly. The tabloids. The tabloids. And the three of them said in order, \"Prince discovered dead by AIDS, Prince murdered, Prince suicide.\" And I'm just like, \"Holy **** How are these magazines still a thing?

Knowing it was fake, but wanting to see what Bat Boy was up to. Yeah. This has been honestly a question since I was since the 80s. Since I I I remember seeing that and asking like what like cuz you think when you're a kid, you're like, \"Wow, that's crazy. That's that's got to be real, right?\" Similar to how everyone thinks anything they read on the internet is real. But your mother's like, \"No, he you know, cuz when I was a kid, it used to be like aliens.\" It was always aliens, right? Aliens are flying over Ohio.

I'm a big fan of Do You Know, I respect your choices and stuff, but I feel like I'd be real judgy if I saw someone buying a National Enquirer. Like, what the **** is that? I think, but again, I think it's one of those things like at this point, I don't know why people buy them. I would hope they're buying them for just the sheer entertainment value of it and not actually buying into whatever messaging is coming from this.

Uh, this is an article about, yeah, how do they do all this and how does this not go? They're talking to a veteran entertainment lawyer. He tells a celebrity that the tabloid will aggressively fight back. So, the lawsuit will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, will probably drag on for years.

That's what some people were saying and that that's what got an overdose or some sort of like broke his body like sleeping pills because he was sick and he thought he needed and I mean that again that is every bit as maybe ridiculous as saying he died of AIDS. I don't know. We don't know. We could be prolific. This is how these rumors get kind of spread, right? Is that someone says that little bit of misinformation and you think you look at a guy like Prince who has a sort of androgynous past, you don't know what his sexuality was, but he's a rock star, so you feel like he can probably **** whoever he pleases whenever he pleases.

So, these are how these things get spread, right? It's not beyond the realm of people's sort of biases to buy into this stuff. Um, the more dangerous thing is when places like TMZ start spreading rumors because they're kind of seen as a credible media outlet. But I mean, I think there's a difference there though. It's like the things that they say are substantiated by something something. But it's also but it's insidious, right? Because you're like you didn't need to report that.

It's a total invasion of privacy. because you're in the public eye and because you fall under those those laws or or or you know you're you're a little less protected than average Joe. Um then they can totally **** you over. A perfect example is um I was going to was it was Amy Schumer, right?

I'm sorry. I don't want to take that right now. and he said, \"You have to. This is America and we paid for you.\" I think were his exact words.
