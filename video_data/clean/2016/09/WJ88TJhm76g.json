But this year too, you've introduced story packs now, like the Ghostbusters Story pack, which are meteor experiences that then come with the ability wait hold on, Kevin, give me the give, hold on, don't do it yet, now do it, okay. Meteor experiences that come with a new way to design, yeah right, Kevin, look at that, huh, with these things that now you can go into and you redo your portal to spruce it up, yeah, yeah, absolutely, and and so there's three of these, there's this one uh, there's Fantastic Beasts which is like mid-November um",

I liked how it was 14 seconds of button presses to say you could shake your head no on that one. I would have been fine with that, but yeah, yeah, that was one of the big takeaways.

You can use 20 different arenas, and you can spend all day just arena-ringing each other. Um, but I'll say it like that - that's a weird thing that sounded weird. The coolest thing is that it's any of your toys, so it's not just like, \"Oh, only these new gold tag toys.\" It's any of the toys from year one and year two you can put in the arenas. Um, which is the coolest thing now as a big LEGO Dimensions dork, as you know I am; the gold tags many would look at and say, \"Oh, that of course means that's their year two content,\" which is true but it",

Cuz for me like it was so clear last year that there were the fun packs right here - some figures team packs two characters level pack a medley level, a new set of trophies that's where you're going to get. And then this year came in you the purple Story pack branded content and that is like you're playing the entire Ghostbusters movie correct?
