They were small people; it wasn't like a Greg Miller trying to get on the table, w'th small they were they were light-looking people, but one of them was incredibly tall, taller than any man has any right to be, and I saw him sitting on the table, and what was bad is I mean there was an absent one of",

That would have been a bad look for us. So maybe we should tell people not to sit on the table, but I guess when you don't have another option, yeah, we're all just climbing on boxes back by the window. But it was funny to me that like I walked in and looked - this is not a criticism in any way, shape or form - but I would have looked in there and said, \"There are these amazingly heavy road cases that are clearly made to go on trucks and get stuff stacked on top of them, and could probably take a downweight of at least 1,000 pounds per.\" And then there's clearly an IKEA",

It's exactly the same; they're going to just get out of it no matter what because they're rich. These rich people get out of everything. I don't know if that's even the point. The point is, in a bad situation like this, you have to defer to the machine's purpose. The machine's purpose is not necessarily to kill someone but the machine's purpose is to get you from point A to point B safely. So, like I actually agree that I think it's an interesting point right which is that you put on the news and a car just murdered you or the car did what we probably expected it's going to do at some point and it is right it's going to at some point like I mean that's why I think Uber is the company that's actually paying",
