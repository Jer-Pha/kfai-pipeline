We've talked about this before a few weeks ago. We went down to their store - They measure you and make you a suit made to order, look at me in the suit coat all right, look at this! Look how good I look! I have a waist; it's crazy, and then on the inside, look at this: I got the cool lining. And I had to put my Twitter handle in there - @GameOverGreggy. So whenever this jacket gets stolen from me on the streets of San Francisco, someone will be able to tweet me if they have it. Um, the Indochino idea is pretty cool. You go in there; suits are made to order. They build it out; it looks good on you. It looks really good on you.

I just like the ending Yeah, the ending is weird. Yeah, but I don't know how to interpret it. So I don't necessarily want to Jump all over.

It reminds me a little bit of Journey in a sense I think Journey was a little more overt about what it was about but I agree It reminds me that in the sense that it's like kind of up to interpretation I think that what I really liked about it was The fact that it is open to interpretation, but as I said on the GamesCast I think to Such a deliberately made game that I can't help but really be enamored by it.

It's not like a very hard It's not a hard core puzzle game. You were running your head into the wall getting frustrated with it And I like the little secrets too because I don't know if you got all the trophies. I got all the trophies in the Each trophy you can actually beat the game without getting any trophies at all. Yeah, but I got each of the trophies I'm including like the final gold trophy and I like how it opens up and exposes parts of the game that you would otherwise not See and one of the parts I really love is the part with the dogs underground with the the torch Did you do that part?

But I, I messed around with Slay the Spire a little bit, and I think it was it was a pretty cool side-scrolling hardcore side scroller. It's not definitely not for everyone. Mess around with Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 for a couple hours. Is it the letdown people were talking about? Yeah, I. It's very early; it's very preliminary of course. I feel like Championship Edition the original one, which we loved, what a fantastic game that was on PS3 and Xbox 360. There was a simple hook to it there was a simplicity to it. Pac-Man simple, and so you could kind of wrap your head around what the game is. It's not like this overarching kind of like trying to be more than it is. It's just a little bit of a spin on Pac-Man.

Yeah to play it and I'd like to go back to it, but I just wasn't wasn't drawn How much time would you put into Pac-Man 256 or just 256? I didn't play 256.

I mean Bioshock came out how long ago originally nearly a decade almost. And it's the fact that you still do it now where you'll play games where you pick up audio logs and they don't autoplay. So you have to go and you plan through the menu and you try to leave the menu and they stop playing.

Number three in The seemingly never-ending struggle to avoid a hostile takeover of its company Ubisoft; this stage a buyback of shares from previous holder BPI France. Ubisoft is buying more than 3.6 million shares from the bank or 3.2 percent of the company for an astounding $137.9 million dollars, which pegs Ubisoft's possible value at somewhere in the region of $4.5 billion dollars. As GameSpot points out, the loan hostile takeover threat comes from Vivendi, which owns just north of 20 percent of the company as it slowly purchases shares from stockholders eager for a buyout. And this kind of goes hand in hand with an interesting article I just wanted to bring to people's attention at GameSpot.",

I think what they have here potentially is their next Uncharted. I think that this is possibly their next big IP if this thing hits the way it was, I think it will, and it's as good as I hope that it is. I think Horizon is the beginning of something very special for Guerrilla and something very special for PlayStation over the next decade. As they put out a couple more, you know, that's my hope. I feel like proprietary exclusive open-world role-playing games are not very common. I think this is a very, very smart move on Sony's part, on Shawn's part, and the guys over there to greenlight this and be like, yes, we want an open world. It's gonna take time. It's gonna cost money, but we want this is what's hot right now. People are so excited about the Skyrim release people",

But I want to base thing point take but I don't know that's the whole thing is I don't know if it I agree with what you're initially saying and with him right like you know they they'll never meet could do their expectations, right? I understand that Valkyrie X has been looking forward to Neo and I get that. But it's the same thing yeah You haven't heard from Neo and forever. And it isn't the fact that it's not on that scale like more people don't know about Neo than do whereas with The Last Guardian and Final Fantasy XV those are two games that if you're in super gamer dude, dude, you know about you have some read on them You know if you you know you're into Shadow of the Colossus if you were into Final Fantasy's beforehand",

Yeah, so it says so the game was announced in 2004 the first announced release date was summer 2006 and It was supposed to be a PlayStation 3 game It was getting ready to be a launch title the game missed the initial 2006 according Wikipedia the game missed the initial 2006 release window without comment from Koei It wasn't until 2009 that Koei",

Ps3 was the first thing I bought upon receiving a paycheck at my first job at McDonald's, and I loved every minute spent with my PS4 and Vita. Unfortunately, shortly after buying said PS4, I was stripped of my old PSN, losing all my trophies and the few friends I'd accumulated in the next year or so. I will be moving out east to start my PhD and would love to start putting together a respectable list of friends to game with. While I settled in and start meeting new people in the Maritimes - that's the Maritimes, yeah, what's that about?

And all we mix a lot of pop culture references, movies, TV shows, and of course video game music in our music. We also love the non sequiturs and absurd humor such as literal translations. The name of our band, Faux Detective, is a literal translation of the Hong Kong movie Mad Detective.
