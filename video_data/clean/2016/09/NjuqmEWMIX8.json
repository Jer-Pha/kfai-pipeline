Like their margin is like 4%. Right if you're Cheesecake Factory and you're selling that much food, 4% of your margin is actually a lot of money. So I would just really be interested to see the back end of how a restaurant like that runs as opposed to a restaurant like Nopa that has 10 appetizers and seven entrees, and then a full bar. You know, like which is really the appropriate way that you're supposed to uh, you know... You got the thing I always get reminded of when I go to a Cheesecake Factory though is I'm like there's 500 things on this menu. No way any of this stuff is fresh; not at all it's all shipped and frozen. Everything's getting fried, that's pretty much it. Sure you you have to assume half that stuff. I feel like that's every chain restaurant though. Yeah but I mean Chili's ain't out there picking the tomatoes off the Chili's is.",

I felt like my Coke was really big. I mean we're all the same size maybe got big hands like Coke. I uh I will say as an aside today we went and got ramen that Ramen place is like one4 as good as the place we usually go by the way TR to throw that out there, I thought it was good though I didn't think it was near fine it was okay you know I'd eat there again but yeah I probably eat there again too because I'm profoundly lazy about finding food uh but uh I ordered a Pepsi just to piss Tim off because I saw in the thing but I was telling Kevin a backfired on me completely because Pepsi is usually fine but this was real sugar Pepsi and I",

So well, I think it might be harder to find that than you think though cuz I I was up uh ordered a Diet Coke this weekend they gave me a Diet Pepsi that's all I had unfortunately uh this place I was at and I guess the can said we don't use aspartame anymore so everything's I guess they've switched over some of their sweeteners which I wouldn't know because I'm not a Pepsi historian um nor will I ever be but that was an interesting interesting change of events it was not good I still don't like Diet Pepsi and I prefer",
