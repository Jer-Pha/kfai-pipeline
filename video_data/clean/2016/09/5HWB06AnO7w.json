I was going to say, boil it down, it's like Cards Against Humanity right? The rules - I wanted to play with you guys; explain the rules to us. I've never actually played the card game, so we'll see how this goes. I guess when we did at some point, was it just me by myself? It might have just been you; I just sat in my room with Greggy dealing cards.
