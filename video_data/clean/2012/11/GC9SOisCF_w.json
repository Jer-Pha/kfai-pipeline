I'm Greg Miller, and while you were out living your life and chopping down trees, the fine people at Oreo are making endless variations of milk's favorite cookie. So every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like the video. Subscribe to this channel today. We're reviewing Triple Double Neapolitan Oreos. Holy cow, ladies and gentlemen, what will they think of next? Of course, this is Triple Double week here on the show. Last week we had the Triple Double that was just chocolate cookie, white cream, chocolate cookie, chocolate cream, chocolate cookie. It was way too much chocolate. We didn't know what we're getting to now. We have Triple Double White Cookie, pink frosting, uh, white cookie, chocolate cream. You probably get the idea. It's Neapolitan. Of course, every Oreo Oration starts with the first look: tear it open again. Very solid presentation; all the Oreos are intact. Let's get a smell.",

Very solid presentation; all the Oreos are intact. Let's get a smell test. I'm smelling a lot of the shortbread cookie again. Uh, the sugar cookie taste I always talk about. Uh, we'll pull one of these bad boys out. You never know where you're starting from. There you go, and there it is: Triple Double Chocolate Pink. See if it's got...I don't know if it's the Berry Blast. I imagine it is the same berry blast consistency of the pink. We all know I'm a big fan. Let's see what we get. I don't know about this one, ladies and gentlemen. Taste, obviously, this is a taste test similar to the regular Triple Double. Uh, all I'm tasting is the cookie really off the bat: a lot of that shortbread white bread cookie, which I like. I like that shortbread sugar cookie, but now it's a bit too much\u2014a bit too much shortbread sugar cookie. Oh, the frostings are completely lost.",

Same problem as the last Triple Double where you bit into it and it was just all cookie - uh, you know, a little bit soggy on the outside, but again, the white cookie doesn't take the soggy at all; it's no good. I'm not... not feeling this at all. We'll do the twisting test because this is how you do it on Oreo Oration, but nothing's going to save this cookie. Well, that's weird - look at that! I didn't even realize they give you an Oreo indentation there and there. That cookie... well, that's interesting; at least I found something else out in this cookie. Time to review this bastard. Um, I'd say 55, mediocre. It's it's all right; I wouldn't buy this cookie again. You have to be a big shortbread fan - shortbread cookie fan - to get into it, and that's all you want, but I don't like the aftertaste; it's too sweet. The pink is just pink; you can't taste the chocolate ever. Actually, yeah... so I'm saying a lot of bad things about this cookie.",
