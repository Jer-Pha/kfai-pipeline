Now I like Bill Clinton because, um, first of all, Bill Clinton was elected in somewhat of a dubious way, I think. Because this is something I talk about a lot with people who like to vote for third parties, and what could possibly happen when you vote for third parties? You typically folks out there, you typically vote in your own self-interest when you vote third party because you end up hurting yourself. And let me give you an example, okay? Please do, please do. In 1912, right, long before Bill Clinton was born, long before yes, there was a presidential election in 1912, and Taft was the Republican incumbent. He was running against a guy named Woodrow Wilson who was a Democrat. Teddy Roosevelt could have run again in 1908, right? Yes, but he didn't, and Taft came in as his protege.",

Yes, but he didn't and Taft was kind of like his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. And Taft came in, but in 1912 he wasn't too pleased with how Taft was doing so he decided to run third party. The party was called the Bull Moose Party. Mhm. And Teddy Roosevelt took something like 10 or 11% of the vote, mostly Republican that would have voted for Taft and Woodrow Wilson won. So a third party gave us a president that probably shouldn't have been given. We probably shouldn't have been given one in 1992 something very similar I think happened. Bill Clinton was running as a totally competent governor of Arkansas, three terms I think. And he was running against the incumbent George H.W. Bush who had lied about raising taxes so he was very unpopular at that point and then Ross Perot ran. And Ross Perot is the most successful of all third party candidates in American history at a time in the summer of 1992 was actually",

He might have actually won the election; we might be having a different conversation at that point. But mostly because he was a conservative-leaning person, he was against things like NAFTA for instance. People who voted for him were mostly conservatives, and that took away from George HW Bush, and then we got Clinton. Now it's not quite as clear-cut; there were other factors. How many percent did he get? Yeah, I don't remember. He got almost 20% of the vote. Wow, okay. So Ross Perot was like a thorn to force as a third-party candidate, even compared to Teddy Roosevelt.

And the same thing happened, and I hate you know I know we have a lot of liberal viewers out there, the reason George W Bush was elected, of course, was because of a third-party candidacy, namely Ralph Nader. So Bill Clinton was elected regardless of how he was elected, he was a man of the center, I think that he proved that he can work with both sides, and that the '90s were actually a really great time in American history, um, indisputably, and I really like Bill Clinton, I think Bill Clinton's like a good dude. I think he kind of got thrown under the bus by some overzealous politicians who wanted to get involved with his sex life; he shouldn't have lied about it, but he didn't really do anything illegal; the perjury was actually what was illegal, but he worked with both sides of the aisle, he worked famously with a Republican house which was the first Republican house in decades.",

Um, he was an Allied Commander and quite an astute uh military man, obviously. And we have a history in American you know we have a history in America of electing military men starting of course with George Washington. We had guys like William Henry Harrison, Andrew Jackson, Zachary Taylor, and Ulysses S. Grant, Teddy Roosevelt - a lot of guys that fought um.

One of the most interesting things about Eisenhower though is that as a man of the military, a man who you think would be in the corner of the military he um and he warned us about something called the Military-Industrial Complex which is um something that we deal with today. Something where uh uh a self-fulfilling prophecy almost of be the military uh becoming bigger and bigger and bigger and controlling a sector of the economy in which it kind of extracts what it wants and to just be careful of of a a burgeoning military that really doesn't serve a purpose except for you know lining in the pockets of people stuff like that and maybe even becoming dangerous to the people that support it.

Things started to get a little bit better, then they started to get a little bit worse, but FDR was the man of the people who tried to fix things by creating governmental programs that I think saddled us with and and stuff like that, and aren't necessarily um good for us long term, such as Social Security. But um, at the time those programs made sense and made him very popular, and then of course the war broke out uh with the Nazis and the Japanese; the Japanese first, and the Nazis yeah um starting in 1941 involving us um, and we launched ourselves into that war in '42, and so there was just a bunch of situations where you don't want to switch horses midstream.
