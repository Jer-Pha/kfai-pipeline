So every Tuesday and Thursday, I sit him down, reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at him, we have a conversation here for your amusement. Colin has no idea what's on the cards until I read him here.

Yes, today's topic of conversation is pennies. Pennies, this is submitted by Kyle Burton.

What are these things? Problem, what's the problem? Pennies suck, yeah, nobody wants them, nobody needs them, yeah. So what are you asking about? You seem to have an answer already. It's a conversation with you. What do you think of pennies? Where are you with me on all penny fronts? When can we eliminate pennies? I'm assuming Kyle Burton would also like pennies eliminated, yeah. I mean, unfortunately, the getting rid of the penny - the discussion around getting rid of the penny is old and it's unfortunate because it has to do with an unhealthy economic system, an inflationary economic system, which is a shame in its own right. Do I like pennies? No, I think they're cumbersome and annoying. Um, psychologically on the American consumer, it might be a little troubling because no more will you find the $7.99 deal, you know, or the 793 or the",

I'm trying to think, he told me he bought like something outrageous when he was younger with like all the change he saved - like thousands of dollars. And uh, I do the same thing. Like people just throw pennies away or whatever; just like I like to take all my change and put it into this you know jar I have or whatever. And I like the notion of saving pennies and nickels and dimes but I agree with you they're not very practical. Um, but again that's not a sign of the change itself not being practical; it's a sign of the fact that everything's so expensive now that people would rather just deal in higher currency. And that brings up a troubling question we just want to get down to the ease of use.",

Just everything... there's something psychological about the term 99 Cents, man. Apparently, clearly, I mean, clearly, there's something psychological about it because it's everywhere on everything. Yeah, this isn't $3, it's $2.99. This album isn't $14.99 or $15; it's $14.99. You know, it's like there's something to it. There's clearly something to it, or no one would do it, you know what I mean? But getting rid of the penny... sure, if that's what makes you happy, but then you have to consider the greater question of inflation and why these things are happening.

I think money is just money; we all can think we're smart enough to think it out. $15 is $4.99 fine; just make it 15, yeah. Yeah, I wonder what the repercussions of that would be on the consumer in terms of people who are subconsciously being affected by the $14.99, that might not buy it at $15. Well, that's their problem; they'll get used to it or they'll get old and die. It's time for the old people to get out of the way. Colin, let's let the younger generation move on up, okay?

I had it from like middle school all the way through. It's like this old Vans wallet. It was like velcro one time with the velcro stopped working in like the late 90s, and all of a sudden I kept it 'cause a buddy of mine gave it to me; it was sentimental kind of thing. Yeah, and um, I had had like a little zipper for the change in it, and I used to love, love, love paying an exact change with that thing, and I can't do it anymore, which is where the the the uh the ascent of the the change jar that I that I now have comes from because I just have to drop it.

I'm going to dig this out of my pocket for you. Yeah, right out of the right pocket, not in the wall to get too thick. Oh, it was sometimes ridiculous like it was like George and that, and that's where the wallet is just unwieldy and it flies open. I know, man. Sometimes I have to take it out and kind of put it in my front pocket 'cause I'm sitting at a locker, your back gets out of whack. Yeah, you know what? No good all due to the penny. Well, but the nickel is really the problem as far as thickness is concerned. I would actually blame it most on the nickel. Dimes are fine; dimes are nice and dimes are barely there. The dime is like the equivalent of the Euro penny, which is like so small you can barely see it. Yeah, well, the real question too is who came up",

The nickel's bigger, but then the dime is smaller - like whose brilliant idea was that? I know, was added later, you think maybe I don't; seems like something you'd know. Oh, I don't, I don't know the history of the currency. Okay, very well, okay, you might be right about that because even if it was added later, it's like the penny and then the nickel and then the quarter - yeah, so there's a space in between. Yeah, it's like when you examine this: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars - like these are you know Earth is bigger than Venus, which is bigger than Mars, which is bigger than Mercury.

I had to like convince people to like, like going to have them like if you used to buy like tickets like on Long Island Railroad or MTA New York City, like, and you put in like a $20 bill, you got like $15 back; it would give you **** 15 Sacagawea coins.

How many people out there were just going through their friends' dad's Playboy magazine? That was totally normal to me when I was a kid.

I'll leave you with this story that has nothing to do with pennies but has everything to do with Playboy magazines.

I'd dig through them over lunch, and looking at the old ads and letters was the best part. A lot of things were 99 cents back then.
