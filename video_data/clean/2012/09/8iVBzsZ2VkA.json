If you like it, make sure you like this video, share it with your friends, and then subscribe to us here on YouTube. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is Jericho. Now Jericho, of course, is his old CBS show. Right? Yes. That I didn't think looked dumb when I first saw... you know that everything explodes, and well, I guess you tell about it. It's your conversation. What's Jericho all about? Jericho is about a fictional town in Kansas, uh, that deserves to get blown up, that's at the center of uh a very devastating event in American history, it's future history so it doesn't actually happen, uh, but uh it's about",
