There was an article not too recently about how the buses are held together with duct tape and plastic bags. And then yeah, the MUNI is the end train specifically is late all the time. It doesn't show up when we try to go home from work, from where we work. It doesn't show up. They they send down 15 freaking cars, no ends. Then finally, then will come by and it's jammed with people. Yeah, I think you know it's it's strange because the the train system on its facade if you're on the periphery it looks okay. Everything looks like every time somebody visits San Francisco what they say is oh it's so nice you don't have to own a car you have this reliable public transportation. We took it from the airport, it was really easy. You got you got to break it from them, you got to let them know it's like they've never lived in another city before and perhaps maybe they've never",

Well, we have to differentiate between public unions and private unions. I have no problem with private unions; my uncle is a draftsman in a private union. Private companies decide to use various unions, and that's fine because the market dictates those terms. You don't have to use them, but when you have public unions robbing the taxpayer shamelessly, that's a different issue entirely. So I'd hedge on the side of caution saying all unions are bad, but all public unions like MUNI certainly are.",

Is there anything else the city of San Francisco needs to know from you? Uh, I don't know. Where do you even begin with San Francisco? This place is a this place is a **** **** hole, but but God bless it. All right. Well, we made some progress, ladies and gentlemen, on what's wrong with Muni. What do you think? Sound off in the comments below. Let us know what you'd like to see as future conversations with Colin. Until then, I hope you have a conversational day. I went to take my shoes off, and the woman's like, \"Oh, you don't need to do that here.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, I don't need to take my shoes off because it doesn't make any **** sense.\"",
