It was, you know, it was pretty good, yeah, a little eggy flavor. Was that jeez, was that the first time? Was that the first time for pizza and mayonnaise to unionize? Uh, yeah, that was the first time I had ever done it. Uh, the funniest one to me though is putting mayonnaise on eggs which I really like doing because it's just... monotonous, it doesn't make any sense since mayonnaise is mostly egg anyway, yeah, it's like I feel like a singularity, like a black hole is going to open up every time I do it because it's the same matter, OCC space, yeah, it doesn't really make any sense but... but I really enjoy that as well.

SL I'm telling you, go get some Miracle Whip, you'll know what I'm talking about when you do it. It's got that little moist noise that you probably wouldn't like, like sour cream somewhat, but like a little more put together so it's a little more substantial, I would say, than something like sour cream. Okay, uh, but man, I love that. Because the other thing I'll leave you with this and we'll stop talking about me, I don't care, this is your conversation, we can talk about when I was in college, I was so crazy about mayonnaise, uh, I you know I was poor like every college kid is, so I would go get turkey and cheese and bread and like make sandwiches over and over again but I",
