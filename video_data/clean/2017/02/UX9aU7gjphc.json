And so I asked him, \"Is it logical that that robots or AI would look at humans and be like, 'You're the imperfect piece of this puzzle that's holding back whatever progress they define'?\" And he had a really interesting answer for that.

Have they told you that it's not in stock? They may simply be lying to you, fueled by a new program that discourages GameStop salespeople from selling unopened copies of video games. The program is called Circle of Life, which gives each GameStop store different percentage quotas for one pre-orders, two reward card subscriptions, and three used game sales and four game trade-ins. Each of these quotas is based on the store's total transactions: pre-orders and reward card subscriptions are based on the number of transactions, while used game sales and trade-ins are based on the total dollar value of transactions.

We also tell customers we don't have copies of new games in stock when they are on sale, for example Watch Dogs 2 is currently $29.99 new and $54.99 pre-owned; we just tell them we don't have the new one in stock and shuffle them out the door.\" End quote.

GameStop staff have told me that corporate managers are monitoring both stores and individual employees, asking everyone to get a Co score of at least 75% by hitting at least three of their four quotas. If a store is hitting their Co targets but one salesperson is not, the salesperson may face punishment or even lose their job, according to company employees. Um, so the story goes on and on.
