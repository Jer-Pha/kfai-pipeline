Blue Apron a better way to cook right the protests are a great first step but are the protests like the only thing that I think about is like what do people really really give a shout about in this country right yes we care about social but at the end of the day what do we really care about basically our wallets how do we how do we take all this energy and push it over to something that's actually going to affect people's at the bottom line right and then then you'll start seeing some change if the protest had shut down the airports holy **** that probably would have caused something right but they didn't but I mean I'm not saying we should I'm not saying that's that's a possibility but but if United Airlines couldn't",

I think people should absolutely get out there and speak their mind.\" But I do see that rift every time I see that big like the women's March - you just start to see that rift from the right to the left keep opening more and giving people the opportunity to say, \"Look at these people; they're what a waste of energy.\" You even have that sentiment.",
