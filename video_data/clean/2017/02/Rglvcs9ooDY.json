Polygon's pre-review stated that over the course of my time with Breath of the Wild, I've had repeated problems with the left Joy controller part - partially or even completely losing sync from the Switch console while docked and connected to my television. This is a pain in the ass at best, but has it also resulted in several deaths playing Breath of the Wild? The only a limited number of systems being played by press makes it a bit concerning how common we're seeing this particular issue. Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann has been able to replicate the issue, linking a YouTube video from Game Informer that convincingly details the problem. So watch out for that.

Yeah, so I actually pre-ordered one, and uh, so here's the thing - you can all give me hell for this um, I, I like Nintendo, but I'm not a giant Zelda fan, and that's literally the only game you're going to get on day one that's even like... You've got a Mario game coming later in the year, right? Yeah, when that comes, I'm interested and excited. So I did pre-order it, and then uh, just a couple of days ago, I ran into somebody who was a Super Nintendo fan who couldn't get a pre-order, and I just said, \"You can take my pre at this point.\" That was nice of me, yeah. I just like... it was one of those moments where you imagine that Nintendo has got as good a plan as they are, we have tons of units ready for the holiday sale, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. At that point, I'd be fine with it being the Mario Odyssey game; I'm excited about it's Mario Kart, I'm excited about, but like... I just still mean for me, it's like, yeah, I'm still on the fence with this thing, but",
