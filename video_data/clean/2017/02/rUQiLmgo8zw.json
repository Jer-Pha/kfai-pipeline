Richard Bertrand Spencer from born in 1978 is an American white supremacist. He is president of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank and Washington Summit Publishers, an independent publishing firm. Spencer has stated that he rejects the description of white supremacists and describes himself as an identitarian. He advocates for a white homeland for a dispossessed white race and calls for peaceful ethnic cleansing to halt the deconstruction of European culture. Spencer and others have said that he created the term alt-right and he considers the movement about white identity.

In a 2016 interview for Time magazine, Spencer said he rejected white supremacy and the slavery of non-whites, preferring to establish America as a white ethnostate. Spencer opposes same-sex marriage, which is which he describes as unnatural and a non-issue, commenting that \"Very few gay men will find the idea of monogamy to their liking.\" End quote.

Spencer was answering questions on whether he was a neo-Nazi. He said he was not and then was asked what the Pepe the Frog pin signified. Pepe the Frog is an internet meme so often used by racists and anti-Semites. It was designated a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League. As Spencer was speaking, a mass individual ran up, shocked him in the face, and fled. Sponsor Left later tweeting there was no serious damage. Um, so basically that's what happened.

I mean Richard I mean I don't think anyone at this table or even in our audience would really dispute that Richard Spencer is garbage human garbage. The question I want to pose to you guys is should it have been right that he was assaulted and is this kind of this seems like it's some people are trying to make this the new norm that that political violence is now going to be the answer in 2017 as we move into here.

Uh, this has been obviously a hot button issue and it's funny that it hits so not close to home for me, but I mean the way that ever since this it's been the photo of Captain America knocking out Hitler, it's been Wonder Woman punching a Nazi. It's like all these different things. Nazis suck. This guy sucks clearly, but it's going it's sinking to their level in a way of like, all right, we're not we're not going to make a point that our ideas are better and that you're wrong with our words anymore.

Uh I I do I feel like Oh man, that really sucks for Mr. Spencer that he got punched in the face. Not particularly sleep over it. No, but I mean but it's and also he didn't get like it's violence. I should feel worse about it than I do probably. I don't. If you had shown me that with zero context, I'd been like that's messed up. That's messed up. That guy just got sucker punched in the face, which sucks. Uh, which tells me the exact same thing, right?

Um, and as far as what you're trying to accomplish with it, you're actually setting back your own agenda a long way. And that's the unfortunate thing is would we be talking about this guy had someone not punched him in the face? You would know who he was. I probably wouldn't have context for it. Actually, I mean, I heard that name in passing, to be honest. I didn't know really anything about him until I'd seen the whole thing, including the Nazi salute thing, but I didn't remember his name.

But nonetheless, I never I had heard that name, but I never really knew who he was. So, to your point, I would have we would not be talking.

It's like that's that is an interesting way to look at it, you know, where it's like the guy didn't punch him to prove his point. The guy punched him to shut him up, right?

Cuz I mean, we were clearly at war then, and your grandfather was doing it on a battlefield, and all these different things. It wasn't I mean, where do we start drawing that line?

I can't speak my mind. Blah blah blah blah. Yeah. I mean, I do think that it does unite people on the other side in a nonviolent way from the violence. I think that like that punch did unite a lot of people that are on the left side of just being like this is a problem and **** this and here's how we're going to talk about it or whatever. and where that comes into condoning the violence. That's where it gets really gray to me because like you can't separate those things that happened, right? I don't know.

It is you are actually fighting the people that you don't agree with because you believe in it that much that you will physically fight for it, you know. And I think that the protester situation is a little different. It's a running up sucker punch.

All it takes is a couple people seeing this and being like \"we could do that too\" and then you have a real problem. Sure.

It's like the whole uh YouTube copyright stuff where everyone always talks about the what's the thing free fair use, fair use where it's like fair use is it's not a right that you're given to um to use whatever the hell you want, it's a thing that if you get in trouble in court you can use that against yourself.

It's like you can't say these words are banned, if you say it's cuz it's not that clear. So whatever he's or whoever they are are saying things I just don't think that it's possible to define what is and isn't okay for inciting a riot and I think that that's where we're getting into a dangerous territory. You know when I think about this I think in terms of you know when I was a child I studied the uh the martial art of Kempo. Yeah. Of course, kung fu and karate.
