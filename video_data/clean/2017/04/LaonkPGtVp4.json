There suddenly be said when every single fighting game released afterward had come out with three times Street Fighter's roster and with far quicker updates. And now this might happen with Persona 5. The circumstances may not be as shitty, the translation isn't bad, the streaming situation can be easily reversed. But it didn't have to happen. It was the one game I'm certain lots of people were hoping would release issue-free. My launch experience has been soured as a result. And if Atlus is going to come up with their own patches and road map to polish the localization, I might just put the game down then and there.

I mean, we're at a point now with games where there's no longer the holiday season; the entire year is full. So, oh, we need two more months all of a sudden dramatically changes the game plan of EA as a whole. It's like you gotta get the game out when you say you're going to get the game out. But this all comes back to the fact that, like I mean, as consumers and players and gamers or whatever, I mainly as consumers, we're not blame-free in this. This is what we always talk about, right? Don't pre-order a game; don't do this. Like my leading into Mass Effect, right? I kept saying there's no way launching in Spring something's wrong with that game. Why haven't we seen it?

Why is that happening?\" And then, of course, Beyond that, I've had pretty good luck in terms of crashes with Telltale Games. But there are problems with people's saves getting deleted and this not working, too. It's that thing where if people like me continue to give them passes on everything, you can't be mad when it's messed up. Absolutely, I think the \"vote with your wallet\" kind of mindset gets complicated because the people who need to keep supporting it are the ones who support things they like about it, not paying because of the stuff they don't like.

But I mean, the argument would be, okay, instead of jumping in full force, I'll wait and see what people think. Reviewers that that is absolutely fair, like yeah, don't pre-order, go for that, sure. I mean, I'm kind of split on the don't pre-order thing because I pre-order a lot of games because in my mind if I'm going to be buying the game anyway, I might as well get the free bonus item that's being offered in the pre-order.

I mean I'm remembering when Mass Effect first released a lot of people on the internet were talking about well why does Bethesda get a pass with some of the janky animations that they have in Fallout, in Skyrim or Skyrim in Fallout 4 when you know Mass Effect: Andromeda is getting so much hate? Sure it's like why do why do certain developers you know get to have glitches and bugs in their open world games and other developers don't. Like the standard is so much higher.

What's the right answer and is it a case by case thing?

Like I would have wanted to wait to get that game as it should be instead you gave me a masterpiece of a game lacking an ending, lacking entire like third it felt like that sucks you know? But then again it's like all right well then is the answer just not doing it? I don't know but the real answer is finish the game sure before you put it out sure. I hear you yeah it's complicated it is complicated. I just want Metal Gear Solid 5 to have a good story that's all I want.
