So it starts at let's start with IGN unless there's something interesting before that, yeah. It's I don't know, so I guess I have to start before IGN even because I actually GameXplain itself is 15 years old, I think. I had the idea for this back before Video or even YouTube was a thing really online; I was making videos online back in '99 for a website called Nintendo Vision. So we were doing full narrative video guides. I had I hadn't hit puberty yet, so my voice like super high - I can't imagine it's crazy.

I'd been doing them for two years at IGN, um and up to that point at GameXplain, because at GameXplain at the time it was only video guides, that's all we did uh so I already started burning out doing the video side of it for guides, um and then doing the written side of it at IGN, I started really burning out on that um so I thought maybe a change of scenery would be good also the pay raise was the worst thing ever going against bot um but you know I only stuck out there about for a year and a half.

I feel like... but I think they announced your Metroid game at E3 and then I think they also announced... and it's coming next year, 2018, whatever they say. Maybe don't even say the date, and I think some between then and now, more imminently, you'll get a Prime on Switch - that either is through eShop or if it's some kind of re-release thing.

I I think we definitely will the next Zelda, I think will will I think it probably will be a 2D game so because I don't think they can deliver another Breath of Wild style game anytime soon and they want to keep Zelda going. The question though is yeah I think we will still get smaller scale games like for the 3DS. How do you do they charge full price on those now or do they charge what they would have on 3DS because people are going to compare the next Zelda to of the Wild like why is it 60 bucks as well when it's I think they'll they'll charge 3DS prices for this yeah and that'll kind of set the tone of what's happening",

If we didn't get that on the Wii U, I don't know that we're going to get the perfect console for like the one game that was made for the GamePad - the one game instead that is Star Fox Zero. Instead, Star Fox Zero is a GamePad game, like that. That is it's the most upsetting to me ever because Star Fox 64 is one of my top games of all time. I **** love that franchise. Um, Star Fox Assault, despite its flaws, the on-in-air things were freaking awesome. It had some awesome ideas and the story of it for Star Fox I loved it. It was it felt like a sequel to 64 and then they just kept going off the deep end with all of the **** **** and then with zero I'm like we're finally getting a Star Fox in the Wii U and then I was like oh this is the game that they're going to use",

Good for you guys.\" Right? The Wii U just never...like, here we don't know what to do with it. It is kind of interesting that Ubisoft probably had a better grasp on how to use it than Nintendo did. Um, no dude, I'm with you, man. Like, I mean, I feel like I want to say they should reboot Star Fox\u2014that's literally what they've done like three times now. Like, I don't know what they do with Star Fox now. I mean, I think they **** up too bad with Zero. Like, I think it's done, and that hurts me. It really hurts me. But you know what?

I think it's just time to all you Smash Brothers just suck it up and start using a controller made in this decade. Oh no, no don't what if they did this though? Instead they're like an adapter ain't going to work but they'll give you the Pro Controller - a new Pro Controller that's like a GameCube one or they give you... joy-cons that are the joy-cons that are the ones I would absolutely love.
