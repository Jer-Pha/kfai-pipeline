And I'm a Smash Bros fan, obviously one of my favorite franchises of all time, but one of my favorite things about it is the hype train leading up to it and I loved that for both Melee or not Melee for Brawl and for the Wii U and 3DS one they would do the thing where every night, every weeknight you got something new.

I love that franchise. um, Star Fox Assault, despite its flaws, the on-rails things were freaking awesome, it has some awesome ideas and the story of it for Star Fox was loved, it felt like a sequel to 64 and then they just kept going off the deep end with all of the nonsense and then with zero I'm like we're finally getting a Star Fox in the Wii U and then I was like oh this is the game that they're going to use the game",
