And then I put the serious tag in there. I'm not saying like oh, you know, you can be whatever you want it to be; we're not doing the dumb thing, oh go look in the girls' locker room unless that's really what you would do or whatever boys' locker, sure. Yeah, you know what I mean? Whatever you want to do with it. But I'm saying you have all the abilities of Superman now. What would you do with it in real life?

I don't know what you say you would want to do but like try to take over the presidency or whatever it's going to be like that. And I feel like you can't do that because then ultimately what you're doing is saying to the rest of the world, \"I'm a tyrant now. I'm going to take this by force and not by legal means.\" So then of course you're just asking for everyone to be like, \"All right, what's this? Script tonight?

So I'm like all right cool, I like that you got to figure out what you're working with. It's a great thing, like an American alien, right? Where it would be, can I fly in this? Can I fly to the moon or will that kill me? Or how's that going to work? You know, that's it's pretty risky. You don't know what's going to happen up there if you can breathe up there like you can fly up there but will you be able to breathe?

That's the same thing with flying at that velocity - can I breathe? Is that okay? Am I still... what... what is com book wants real... see that's what's scary. I mean, earlier we were talking about this during the weekend of how do you know what you can and can't eat like when you think back to like who decided to milk a cow - that's super weird.

So when we were at the airport, she's like, \"Oh, I almost forgot and bought one.\" Like, \"Oh, that's a cute little\" it's a great mug; it's got a lot of uh it's what I like about this mug is that it's it's whiter and not taller. The like see everything about that uh I feel like probably you wake up with superpowers. What's happen uh so the thing is this like your your first inclination is always to be like, \"I'm going to fight crime right\" but how ridiculously well or whatever I'm to profit I'm going to fight crime. I feel like those are the two like roads you can go down right. I mean I'm kind of going to be a villain or I'm try to be a superhero.

People who can affect real change are people who run like countries. Like Donald Trump has the opportunity to actually affect real change. We've seen it in the last couple weeks with him breaking his quote-unquote foreign policy with Syria and deciding to bomb them because of their use of chemical weapons. So I feel like that's what I would do is angle toward everything toward running for the presidency. I feel like I would start by having the world's most amazing YouTube channel and social media-like personality.

I'm out, started FUBU, and then I feel like yeah, I feel like you actually get really political and you take a run for the office because at that point, you've got enough clout because you're Superman - to like if if if the last election process proved anything to us, it's that if you're super popular, you have a really good shot of being the most powerful man on the planet.

How does that how do we bring just a level of equality that happens in such a way that over the span of 30 to 40 to 50 60 years we don't notice it's happening but all a sudden it's like wait a minute someone turns around and like we're good, and then I go \"aha\" you're welcome here's a box own right. What's that impossible to figure out on your own yeah right I mean you you would need be a master strategist right and that's the that's the problem is at a certain point what do you need to make that happen?

But I feel like being able to lift a truck doesn't really factor into that at any given point. Well, see if you had superman powers, I think the easiest way to fix it right was to recreate Pangaea, take all the continents, shove them back together because if we're right there, we talk to people easily. The worst part of the reason why we haven't been attacked well other than 9/11 was because we have this like this big beautiful ocean around us now we got to figure it out now now everybody's got to figure it out. Get rid of a couple places.\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n* \"scarpino\" to \"Scarpino\" (proper noun)\n* \"superan\" to \"superman\" (common knowledge reference)\n* \"Pangia\" to \"Pangaea\" (geographical term)\n* \"Herculon\" to \"Herculean\" (correct spelling)\n* Added capitalization for proper nouns like \"Nick Scarpino\", \"America\", and \"9/11\"\n* Left the rest of the text intact, as it was already coherent and grammatically correct.",
