Like it was set by sort of a Nintendo model which really came out of the coin-op model and I'm not talking Nintendo but why after three fails are you penalizing me back further? I'm obviously not that good but you're penalizing me more heavily because I'm not that good. I I was looking at that and I was like psychologically",

But they but we don't, we're not really ever told that, at least I wasn't told that. Like real progress comes with grinding a little by little every day until you get it right. It's not even about fail succeed, fail fail succeed, it's about try, try, try, try, try, oh that worked, try, try, try, try, try, oh that worked. And like these things that are incredibly important in life, I really feel like they don't come to you in a week, they don't come to you in a day, you don't have the aha moment, you just work at it, you work at it, you work at it, and after a year or two, you're like oh, I guess I've achieved that, I guess we're there.

Yep, and that's the big thing I always take away from when I talk to somebody who... when I write a letter about suicide or when I talk to someone on the rare occasion I've talked to someone who was at the pinnacle of thinking about this - it's the fact that anybody I've ever heard from who survives the suicide attempt is always like \"yeah, it's better. I shouldn't have made that decision at that point.\" You know what I mean? The people who you talk to...

What does that take you know what I mean? Like yeah there's a good Netflix comedy special by Neil Patrick Harris, no wait, Neil Brennan who was one of the guys that wrote Chappelle's Show. He talks a lot about that right and what he talks about is that he's been depressed for the vast majority of his life and that a lot of people are like how could you possibly be depressed you're writing on Chappelle's Show right? You're writing on this show back of course like 10 years ago whenever Chappelle's Show was on, like you're writing the number one show on TV right now like everyone loves this this is amazing.

It was like at that point she was CEO, so there were no issues about giving me crap on my stuff, and so I got that in spades, but uh, and so did she. So uh, but it helped us each evolve. But what happened to me was I got into a zone where I realized I couldn't see the good in almost anything, and I would wake up every day with this feeling that as soon as I started thinking about the things that I was too much focused on, I would just feel these total knots build up in my stomach, and be like, \"Can't take it.\"",

It's one of the reasons why I do therapy right now is because that is actually therapy for that in a way; um, it's a very real-world way of reconditioning your brain, and a lot of it is past prior conditioning that I didn't realize was happening over the span of 36 odd years that I'd been alive.
