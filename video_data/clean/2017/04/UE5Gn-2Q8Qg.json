The Pepsi fight scene is the only good thing about Pepsi that's happened. Um, the thing about all of these is that you had to be a fan of the person at the time to really appreciate these movies.

Not saying it's a bad movie in any way shape or form but it just doesn't have... this is another one of those fights, it doesn't have \"Back to the Future\" Part I vs. Part II; it's not a fight everyone loves \"Back to the Future\" Part I.
