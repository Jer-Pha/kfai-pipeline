But I think that's more nostalgia than anything. That's still a fun movie. Yeah, I feel like that movie's been done better in Doctor Strange. They made like four other Iron Man movies, yeah. Well, I'm not even talking about Iron Man just in terms of like a solo movie - Dr. Strange is good, even Dr. Strange. I don't want to watch it again. Guardians, I saw the second time and I... I sat down with my wife and I didn't make her watch it. I was like, \"Encourage her to watch it.\" She was like, \"I'm down.\" She really likes that, and I think it's because there's the touchstone of 80s nostalgia - the one being in Guardians is not a... spoiler when he was in trailers and... and it was talked about.

They've confirmed that Splatoon 2 and Mario Odyssey will appear at E3, and a couple of days ago, talking to their president, they were saying that they would announce new games at E3, which sounds like a no-brainer comment, but there have been some years where that hasn't been the case. Well, it's going to be new games, not just ones people don't care about. Is it going to be a bunch of \"we'll see\"? We'll see Mario Odyssey; it's great to see more of that. Yeah, yeah.
