I could barely read English in third grade, on how hell I did that, but it was the same thing of just kind of figuring... well, this squiggly line throws the Pok\u00e9 Ball, so I figured that out.

I keep relating it to like when you're at a bar or restaurant and the movie's on mute, sure, and you can look up at it and like if someone gets shot in the head, you understand that guy got shot in the head; they're not going to know why. Or like a good example of Bioshock \u2013 if you were to play Bioshock without understanding, you would know when Andrew Ryan gets clubbed to death, but you wouldn't understand \"Would You Kindly\" and you'd miss the context of the moment.

I'm like, what a bad no, and I think that's like without getting too specific, like that is where this game gets even cooler because the but on four different social links are called \"Confidants\" (note: corrected phonetic mistake). They can even change some of that, like they can give you extra free time. They can give you... now much more than just like you're spending campus person and you can date them, and like if it's a party member, they get like an extra tack in battle or whatever they're now like game changers in a way that like they can actually affect the way you spend time in the real world or they can like affect battle.

So when it comes to RPGs specifically JRPGs, I think the story is kind of my favorite part at the end of the day. Gameplay's always fun but it's always the means to an end getting the next cutscene and all that. Like how do you think it holds up? I so to me and when I say my review I do think it's the best one and I will be curious to see what people think. I think the overall story is so much more cohesive and it feels like it matters more to me. And you mentioned like the way the game starts, it just throws you in and then it's",

I think they're really smart about that. I like it is really long and so I do think it gets into like some pacing stuff for the end but like it's all minor. I don't know; I I don't think I don't think Persona 3 or four stories quite have the weight but this one had at least that experience. Well, that's what I thought was really interesting about starting it right and going and do and I... you have that I'm with names, comma she chose dungeon right? Okay, cool.

I'd say if they don't wanna do same sex dating they could have gone the percent reportable like give me a female protagonist option or give you the option to date more people but it just feels really weird how blatant it is when you like level up a female protagonist or a female confidant and it's like hey",
