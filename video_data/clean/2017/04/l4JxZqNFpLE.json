Yeah, I heard it was a little rain, but really, the only problem was I had to bike in it; it wasn't terrible, but it's just one of those things where what made it worse was the fact that everybody was strapping on their umbrellas and a lot of people gave a **** for this because you don't understand that you're living in the Dark Ages, Vancouver.

Uh, two... Cate Blanchett, I believe is in it? You haven't checked that yet, huh? Let's check it - I'm on it! You keep checking it. I think that's her. Fantastic, and three... probably more important than the triceps, no more important than Cate Blanchett but less important than the triceps... uh, uh, uh... Jeff, go! Jeff Goldblum is... uh... the bad guy. It is K. Blanchett, and Jeff Goldblum was probably like \"I don't want to have to get in any prosthetics - can you just paint my lip a little bit?

Yeah, but have him in this as a side who Thor is. Like, I'm so excited to see what it's like for Banner in this. Like, right, is he ever not Hulk in this world?

I'm looking forward to it coming back, but it's the same with like I just watched Homeland and I'm like this is a good show, I just don't know that I need to to like you can't watch a show forever, you know? And there's nothing wrong with saying that there's nothing wrong with saying \"I love your show, please end it.\" You know, it's the same thing we all said with Lost - we were like, \"Hey, Lost man, it's time to end. We love your show.\" I just heard a great uh interview with Damon Lindelof; he's on The Leftovers right now and he's talking about because he's basically trying to I guess they're trying to uh to end the show yeah um The Leftovers no is that what it's called?

I'm sorry, I'm with you, and I'm not into this season but it's because I wish it was just more Negan, just give me more Negan. What's happening, and so when they branch off and it is like here's Ezekiel and his tiger, I'm like well I already know the hook to Ezekiel, you know, like granted this is the other part is I've read all this for the most part, I I honestly feel like the Negan storyline needed to be, I think I felt like it needed to be a little like there needed to be some level of well-roundedness to Negan but I feel like every time we see him it's one note, he's just super evil and throws dudes into fire and doesn't care about anything and it's just not after like seven",

Otherwise I just don't - I don't want that negativity in my life, no 100%. That I understand, that was my concern when they announced this. I love Negan in the comics but Negan in the comics is a one note thing his entire run with the exception of where they're at right now with him you know what I mean like that's a ways away for the TV show but so that's the thing we've already seen that with the Governor, we've already seen that with you know I guess the Governor is the only other example of that in this and that was a really cool storyline and we actually got to see what I liked about the Governor was we got to see the reason why he was so Draconian",
