Let's break it down into parts: should you play The Lost Legacy before Uncharted 4? No, no under no circumstance. You won't get references but a Naviance relationship to people. You won't get out of things. However, should you play Uncharted 4 and then when the epilogue begins stop Uncharted 4 and play The Lost Legacy? I say yes, no I say 100% yes sir. Answer and it is no.

We're not doing this Machete order Star Wars. **** You're not watching Oh watch Fast and Furious 3 and then watch parts of it no **** That no you're supposed to have the knowledge of all that when you play A Lost Legacy I think you're supposed to have the knowledge of everything before the epilogue because that's how timelines work. But here's my argument, it's like what might you know might when I'm in the review where I talk about it's just the fact that Uncharted 4 ended so perfectly and it closes everything up so great. I would much I would totally prefer to have an 18 and Chloe's story inserted before that and then I and then and because I was like I'm talking about right this is gonna be the final is I like Lost Legacy but this is gonna be the final taste that when Uncharted I have for years and years and years maybe forever which isn't true\"",

I hope The Lost Legacy performs well enough to make Naughty Dog go we need to do more of this, more just many things as we're going on still have the big temple game have like The Last of Us or whatever new thing they do but then also have an Uncharted experience the world is too good to to leave and I think that this game shows how you could have just side stories with these awesome characters that we love but they're always gonna feel like sad stories yeah but I'm fine with that like I had fun with this I liked this and you're ruining the sanctity of my Uncharted dude",
