Right? You have bad Hotel Wi-Fi. Um, yeah, you just limit your excuses and right okay, yeah that's awesome. So how was the stand-up thing you doing? Have you been doing a lot of stand-up? I well, you know what, I haven't as much as I'd like; I think the last big show I did was Kinda Funny Live, which is available now on YouTube / Kinda Funny. Your set was amazing, and also I just love that Nick invited you; it felt right, you know, it's kind of like this Padawan-esque thing we got going on. Um, Nick should I be Nick's Padawan or am I Nick's Padawan though? You definitely Nick's, Nick's master, master yeah, I like that sounds hot, it yeah that was great; it was just with um you know",

So I'm very interested in this stuff now because of Nick. Nick went from Zero to Hero when it comes to the stand-up stuff and seeing him talk about it on GOG and then going to the open mics and just continuing to do kind of behind our back for a while, which was awesome. It was revealed that he just did it, and now he'll invite us out to the things we're seeing him get better and practice his set, and his set goes from 3 minutes to 5 minutes, I think he's at 10 minutes now. Like that is so interesting to me. But where are you at in that kind of game? Like you're obviously past the open mic stage, but like what does Nick have to look forward to, and where are you at now? Um, well, I'm at a weird place in that I've sort of transitioned more into writing. Like I'll still tour; I'll still headline a couple times, but I don't love doing",

You know, it could be even like five, but let's say 7 to 10 minutes up front. You're sort of easing everybody in. You do announcements; you tell people not to shout, take photos, but you're also doing your material. So, it's sort of hosting like you'd host anything, but also you get to do your material after that. Something called featuring and featuring is the middle guy or woman \u2013 or woman. The middle person, uh, and you do about 20 to 30 minutes again, depending on what the headliner wants. Some headliners don't want to do a lot of time, so you as the feature will do more time to complement that. Um, sometimes they want to do a lot of time, so you as a feature will do just a little bit of time. And sometimes the host and the feature will be combined. Um, but the feature usually gets paid like $500 to $750, maybe more, depending on who the headliner is and what the club is, but it's not a lot of money.",

Um, yes, and no, it's a good challenge you know because it's so easy especially for someone like me who doesn't do standup as much as I'd like it's so easy to fall into just having the same 10 minutes that you do for 15 years. I haven't been doing comedy for 15 years but like I know people who, you know, I saw them eight years ago where I'm like oh you're still doing that joke and I've done that, I've done a set, you know, I'll do like a 45-minute set somewhere and I'll be like you know okay I can see this crowd doesn't like this new stuff I need to go into old stuff and it it's",

Yeah, you could say that's in every movie - the phrase \"I see you\" is like... I don't remember anything about Avatar, and I saw it twice.

But Avatar feels like someone you dated in college: I don't hate it, but I'm just like, \"That was a thing that existed.\" And see, that's true. Do I need more? Do I need two, three, four, and five?

Must have been a real good year though - it was a good year that like, Sonic 1 came out, then Sonic 2 came out almost immediately after too soon, almost. I remember Toys R Us had a pre-order bonus of a T-shirt and I was like, \"You could get something for pre-ordering a video game? This can't be a scam.\" Um, and then years later I'm like, \"Why am I disappointed by this game?\" I pre-ordered to get a t-shirt anyway. Uh, I'm excited about this - I think it's going to be a great game. I think it just seems like the team that made it understands Sonic, and it's weird to acknowledge that the fans understand the franchise better than the owners of it do, but that's... I mean, we've seen it so many times. Like, I'm a broken record with this, but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on TV now is better than Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has ever been.",
