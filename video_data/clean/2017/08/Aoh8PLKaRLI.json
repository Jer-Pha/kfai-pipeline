For now, let's begin the show with what is and forever will be the Roper Report. Time for some news: three items on the Roper Report. A Breaker's Dozen, number one: Andrea, Get Hype! Valve just got a new game, oh snap! It's called Artifact. Uh, if you haven't seen it, uh, you definitely should read about it here obviously from Polygon, but if you haven't seen the reaction videos to Artifact getting announced, highly recommend you go through your Twitter feed and find the live things because what happens is this Artifact is a card game based on Dota 2.\"",

Just 'cause they were so psyched for a new Valve video game, and it's like, oh, it's going to be like Hearthstone. It sounds like it's going to be exactly like which is, you know, a smart business decision on the part of Blizzard because Hearthstone's been very financially successful. But I mean, is this the game that people want from Valve right now? Right, hell no! I want to stick with that line of questioning. We have something to talk about because number two, Gearbox has revealed its new game - it's called Project 1V one, uh, from their official site which is I think project1v1game.com or project1Vone.com.

Project 1v1 will be holding a short closed technical test this summer; we are looking for a limited number of players to test the online infrastructure and learn what players like you think about the game in order to inform and influence future development. The test will be held on North American servers, so international players may experience decreased performance. Two games heavily influenced by card fashion now of card games and all these different things is I guess I wasn't paying attention Andrea when it was because there are always these waves of video games in waves of video game ideas right where it's like oh man we always talk about it RPG elements, it's an RPG-light where RPG elements made their way",

It focuses on improving the central story of No Man's Sky and adds the ability to quick travel between locations using portals. Patch notes will be made available shortly before the update goes live. What we do is much more important than what we say, but since launch we have sometimes focused too much on that. We wanted to reach out and celebrate the devoted community that remains; so that means so much to us. We launched Waking Titan to try to do that; when we posted those cassettes, this is part of the augmented reality game that just finished.

Shawn Murray has released a letter about a very large update coming this week, and I'm sorry, this week that a community that I didn't know existed seems to be excited about and is giving them hope yet again. Do you think there is any sort of update that would bring back the players who have already abandoned this game or are those players gone for good?

Yeah, I think it's fantastic that they're still interfacing with the people who are playing that game - a quarter of a million is a very sizable group of players, you know. And so the fact that they're making content and they're releasing it for free is a gesture of goodwill to the people who have stuck it out and who are still in that world and still playing that game. I don't think anybody who set it down is going to come back to it because of this - I think there's too many other things to play. Sure, this is a nice story so I'll rehash it as quickly as possible.

Do you think developers need to worry about this? No, the short answer is no. I think that video games serve a lot of purposes, and they don't just need to be mentally stimulating in that kind of a way. I don't think they need to make you smarter. I think video games are good for a variety of mental health reasons; a lot of people play these games, these so-called mindless games, to de-stress, to check out from the stress that's happening in their life outside of that game, whether it be family-related or work-related or just life-related.",

Do you see this wave of nostalgia continuing as a big revenue source for publishers moving forward or is it just a trend now? It's definitely the trend right now. Look at Crash Bandicoot sales - uh, you know we keep talking about it and the fact that oh my God I can't believe there's your show on Monday with this many Crash fans and like Tim being the Crash fan was like I didn't expect it to do this well, I didn't realize that there were so many people out there. But it's a wave you can only ride for so long right? Correct, there are only so many really iconic and well-known retro franchises that could be brought back and have the success that Crash had, and quite frankly, I think Crash may be an anomaly. I don't think we're going to see a lot of these or even like a handful of these selling in the millions of units but doesn't mean they have to sell that many to be successful.",

It's also just speaking of the quality of it right where I think Sonic Mania people are super excited for because hey this is this is a great Sonic game and we haven't had one of those in a while arguably and you can argue a bunch of different ways but it's great in the way that I as a Sega kid, Sega Genesis kid remember and what I want to play. The key is execution sure so Crash Bandicoot executed very well, Vicarious Visions did their job in really making that a great game and from what I've played of Sonic Mania, Sega has also done their job",

You did. I'm sorry for you. Uh, next question comes from Jared Cody, he says good day Greg and Andrea AKA Paragon woman, a follow-up question from last time, but Andrea, did you get your hands on the Paragon update yesterday despite the servers imploding, and if so, what are your impressions on the live environment? Yes, I did. Okay, so last night when the servers finally came back online, I jumped in, I built a couple new decks, and then I played four matches, and I played one Co-op, two Co-op matches, and then two PvP matches because they force you now to play one solo or one Co-op match with the new update to test out the card system before they'll let you play got in PvP. Which is smart. Wow, it's so different. Um, the G the core gameplay is the same right, the shooting, the lane pushing, the minions that's all the same but the way that",

I have Gideon since last year and recently unlocked Gadget. I also have Gadget. I have the Fay for me, and a lot of people watching or listening, what the heck is a master skin, okay? So a master skin is the ultimate reward for reaching the maximum level for a hero, okay? So the hero goes from level one to level 10 when you're at the final when you hit Level 10, you unlock the master skin and it's a special skin that you wear that's really shiny and fancy. It's got like flame colors on it. So they've changed the Mastery system with this new update which I really appreciate as somebody who's almost at the level cap. So they've raised the level cap from 50 to 99, and so Legacy players kind of have their hours cut cuz if",
