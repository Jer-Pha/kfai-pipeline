I have to pick up the cape and cowl stick with me and I don't know, I mean this is I I want you to know I had to search long and hard for this cuz you know I'm not like I not like you I don't have an encyclopedia if I see some people in a movie I'm like they're good great you know what I mean. I'm picking personal friend of mine Anthony Ingruber, I expect none of you to know him, Anthony Ingruber, you would know him and I'll tell you the way I know him and that's because High School exactly what the high school he was great in our production of Guys and Dolls.",

But he is also a real actor, and that sounds insulting but you know not just a voice actor where nobody would understand where he's from. He was also in Adeline where he was young Harrison Ford. So if he can play Young Harrison Ford there - I'm talking Harrison Ford in like his 20s or whatever right? Did a great job has that All-American Playboy look to him, I would say you know what I mean. And so here's like as I feel with all of my picks we need to talk about what is the DC Extended Universe which by the way I hate that they call it - it's just DCU. DCU Cinematic Universe.

He struggled with drug and alcohol addiction and previously talked about suicide as a result of childhood trauma and abuse.

As a recording this Linkin Park put out their official statement on it that said: \"Dear Chester, our hearts are broken.

Was the rap part of it, rapping about feelings, where I'm like, even though I don't share these feelings, I feel like this is real. Like, I feel like somebody's pouring their heart into this.
