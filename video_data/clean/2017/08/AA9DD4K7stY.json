They fit them; they fit cool Greg's everything. What's this topic about Troy Baker whole show? I was just wondering the whole point of me even bringing this up is that if travel is a thing for you, like if you want to do that, I cannot recommend traveling with your partner on a romance - the lady, yeah, you just need to know what you're getting into. Like I did that one of the first things we did was let's go and play together; how's this not your second date? Right, this is beyond like \"ooh, we're something special\" maybe a month then okay, we went to Vegas, uh, and then I was like, okay, you're cool now, I need to say you travel internationally. So within a couple months we did, and she could correct me, uh, but I know for fact it was New Year's Eve.",

So within a couple months, we did, and she could correct me, uh, but I know for fact, uh, was uh New Year's Eve, like we started dating in October, so that New Year's Eve we were in Mexico, and I was like, \"I need you to travel; I want to see you go through Customs; I want to see you pack like crazy.\" The Troy Baker trials here, see? Because I like look this is a thing for me. Like I, I love traveling. I believe look we have looked for trillions of miles in every direction and we still haven't found a place like this so I believe that you have to explore every inch of this planet, and there's something that's first of all something so that is so humbling when you go around the world and you see both the the similarities um and the differences and you realize that you fit in into this much larger it gives you a more of a macro view of who we are as a as a people and you're not so closed off and and you",

And, and you also see that everybody struggles with the same things, and so you're just kind of like all connected in that. So that helps. But as far as like traveling with your partner, there's nothing to me that's better about that. Because when you go to some place that's foreign, and the only thing that's familiar is the person that you're with, A) that better be a really good hang, and B) it just galvanizes the two of you because you're you're like let's get lost together, and you feel more adventurous, you're a little bit more whimsical. Um, and some of the best experiences we've had, like the first time Pam and I went to Paris, um, we're sitting at this little sidewalk caf\u00e9, and I'm like this is this I've been waiting to come back since I was 13 years old with my lady in Paris, like this is what",

(spoilers) She audibly gasps, could not believe it that Bruce Wayne's parents were dead and that's what made Batman. And I was like, I had to pause it, that's going to **** with him. Like I loved it so much, I hope he bounces back from this, I hope he doesn't hold it forever. What happened? He goes to an orphanage. Oh my God, it was so good though. I had to stop and be like Nick, she didn't know, she didn't **** know.
