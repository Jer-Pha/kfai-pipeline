Thank you, it is my birthday today. How does it feel like to be 21? You know, I've been waiting for the chance to legally buy beer in a bar for a really long time. I mean, I have this amazing fake ID that's been doing me pretty well, but now that I get to use my real ID, I'm going to make everyone card me all day. Exactly. Jose Luis Cilas wrote in and said not a question per se, but praise - I just wanted to say happy birthday to Andrea; she's a unique voice in the game and tech space without fear to speak her mind and always with an insightful and interesting point of view. Thankful for the addition to Kinda Funny and always excited for the future. Happy Birthday, Andrea. Oh, that was very kind. Thank you very much. What are the plans? What are the big birthday plans? Well, um, I celebrated with the girls on our stream last week.",

Andrea, what's your read on the situation? So I have a couple of things to say about this. First, I need to be the person to admit that a few years ago in 2015 when they originally said that they were going to close for Thanksgiving, and that was really the first year that we saw stores open on the actual day of Thanksgiving try to get out of Black Friday for Black Friday right, like... um... as when I say day I mean not like midnight I mean like 6:00 p.m. uh the day of, and I had echoed a lot of other people's sentiments that I don't think it's right that Thanksgiving stores are opening that early on Thanksgiving. I am a longtime Black Friday Shopper; I used to get up at like 3:00 in the morning... you seem like",

You seem like someone who would terrify me on Black Friday. I can see you out there with your no my strategy was always to never go for electronics on Black Friday. I always went for clothes because almost every store is 50 to 75% off on Black Friday, so it's easy to repopulate your wardrobe and it's not as crazy as like trying to buy a $200 TV or whatever right. Um, so I've always been a person who shops on Black Friday. But I thought you know what, 6:00 p.m is too early. You're really cutting the day for people who want to spend a little time with their family. You open at like 10: p.m or later then at least people have the bulk of the day. Because after like 7:00 you're all like \"lay the C\" drunk, you know, you're food coma, you're you're not really doing much anyway, you're just chilling if you want to kid's",

If you want to kid's going yeah, so I need to start by saying like I took a public stance that like I didn't like the stores were open on Thanksgiving then today, um, and then today Patrick Hickey made a tweet about how he thinks it's gross that GameStop is opening and I got into it a little bit with people in a thread because as we've seen over the last two years pretty much every retailer is now open on Thanksgiving Day there's like no stopping it and Amazon obviously is open all the time too, and even though you're not physically going into an Amazon store there are people working at Amazon on Thanksgiving to process your online order sure I know I know a lot of their system is automated but there are still human beings that work that holiday to accommodate that influx of retail so my position is I as somebody",

You buy this then the GameStop thing - many of our store associates and and and guess have asked for this. You think the store associates have asked to be open, I think it's Up For Debate what many means how many people are asking for ours I don't know but I do know that GameStop incentivizes stores to sell as much as possible and they get bonuses and rewards for being the top earners in their region and in order to do that what better day to make excellent sales numbers than Thanksgiving Day right before Black Friday when every other retailer is now open so they have to compete with Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and of course we you know online retailers as well and so if they're closed if the store if the company is mandating that they be closed on Thanksgiving then they're",

You know there are thousands of GameStop employees, tens of thousands of employees at GameStop, and so if those employees are going to GameStop and saying, \"Hey, in order for my store to compete, and in order to compete I need to be open on Thanksgiving to take the business away from the Target that's down the street,\" then they should be allowed to. I don't see why that's such a crime. I think GameStop should maybe make it elective.

Yeah, that's in my mind - that's why they're doing that is because both of them have shipped like their major title, and now they're kind of like, 'Hey, we're not really doing DLC anymore for Andromeda.' So to do today, yeah, it's going to be fascinating to see what comes from that. And also if there would be any layoff redundancies from that CU - that's always the concern I feel like when you merge studios.

In other words, how has the reputation of independent games progressed thus far? Is it still more or less the same, or are they on another level now in terms of their reputation?
