My topic is UFC, specifically because I just spent a weekend at my boy James Burke's bachelor party; his bachelor party was insane, quite possibly the most ridiculous uh bachelor party of all time in terms of events number of events crammed into such a short period of time. So I joined them halfway through; they started it Thursday and Friday in Vegas, okay? They did it, they hit Vegas super hard. I joined them Saturday morning; we went to LA to meet them. So they drove from SF to Vegas, drove from Vegas to LA, and I flew into LA. Uh, we went to a Giants vs Dodgers game; who won, and uh the Dodgers one, which was not good for my group of people that were very loud and orange. A lot of orange, a lot of black \u2013 I was wearing blue and white because that's what I do \u2013 they gave me a lot of **** for that, yeah.",

But anyways, H, so we did that and that sucked, and that's where I got blistering sunburns. Why wear horrible fashion over function? That's not it; doesn't have anything to do with fashion, honestly. Because I didn't expect my dumb friend to get seats where he was sitting in the sun. It's like, \"Dude, we got this.\" I should have known when you said we're in a section that's all-you-can-eat, that's not going be... yeah, going be. He showed me pictures of it, and he's like, \"No dude, like here's where we're at,\" and I'm like, \"There's covering; there's shade; there's this indoor area blocked by bleachers.\" You can't even see the game.

Nick you're a huge fan of UFC so I got to be there, I got to see this whole spectacle big deal fight. I was tweeting I was live tweeting it as you do as one does and people kept asking is Nick at the fight to which I begrudgingly had to respond no but Tim is at the fight so many people texted me saying are you and Nick at the fight I'm like no just me no it was it was quite the experience.

Whereas with the fight, because it was two people literally beating the **** out of each other, it's like it was a bit more like real - where I'm like, I don't need to understand what's happening; you just see someone fall down bloody if someone falls down and doesn't get up, that's the end of it, right? And so, like, that to me was one of the things WWE obviously does much more of - a lot more production value, everything they do, the entrances... it's uh, it's like theater, right? Absolutely. It really is life theater - not just their performances, but even just them walking out, even just the lighting and just everything - it's so hyped.

They set up the story perfectly where one of the dudes, a Brazilian jiu-jitsu guy, if he gets you to the floor, you're done.

It was that's a match-up of two really good strikers, and you just let's see what happens like put two strikers in there and see what happens, that's what I like about the UFC though.
