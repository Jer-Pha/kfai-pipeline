We're all kind of doing that, yeah.

Keep where we're learning try trying over here as Kotaku points out, this isn't the only element of the new Junker Town map that is gathering some amount of controversy. The Maps announcement trailer has voiceovers that say quote \"they thought they could take our land\" and give it to the machines. Blizzard caught some heat on social media over the \"they thought they could take our land\" line in light of Australia's controversial history regarding indigenous groups, right?
