So, what's on the new menu? Well, there's seared chicken and creamy pasta salad with summer squash and sweet peppers. Creamy shrimp rolls with quick pickles - I don't know that's... I, I love... I've never heard of a quick pickle, but I'll tell you right now, I'm in 100%. I'm in. Sweet potato wedges and fresh basil fetuccini pasta with sweet corn and Cuban pepper. I see; I cook a lot.

So, so uh on the way there, Greg says to me, like I always had this idea, uh, where you play as a game where you play as a dad and your goal is to meet and romance other hot dads, and um, uh, it, it like the initial thing made me laugh, and I guess the thing we do at Game Grumps is that like if something makes you laugh that's cool, but if you keep talking about it and it just doesn't stop being funny, you're like all right, well how do we do this?
