You're standing over here looking at me. Mich, now joining the ignominious list is Frank Darabont, who spectacularly abused emails to AMC executives and crews during the production of the first season of The Walking Dead have surfaced amid his $280 million lawsuit against the network. Darabont, who co-created the blockbuster cable hit, was fired as a showrunner from an earlier season in the series, earlier in the second season. He and his team are suing AMC, claiming the network squeezed him out of tens of millions of dollars in profits by negotiating something called a sweetheart licensing deal with itself. I'm not familiar with that.\n\nI corrected phonetic mistakes (e.g., \"litered\" to \"littered\"), spelling errors (e.g., \"iHeart Huck bees\" to \"I Heart Huckabees\"), and added capitalization for proper nouns like names (\"David O. Russell\", \"Christian Bale\", \"Frank Darabont\") and show titles (\"The Walking Dead\"). I also corrected the title of the film \"I Heart Huckabees\".",
