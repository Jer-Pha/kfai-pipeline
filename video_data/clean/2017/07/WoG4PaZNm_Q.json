You're on this Lroy kick, cool. Greg, can I have some water? All I love it so much. Um, so I sympathize with that right? It's like, and watching Greg operate on another level for me is inspiring, like I'm using it as motivation. So I make you feel small, you also make me feel small in stature as well because you're a Yeti - he's like 19 ft Jesus Christ, you're so big. Sorry, no, it's not your fault; it's your mom's fault, it's true. You're much shorter, man.

Like yeah, I feel like that's one way to look at it right. The other way to look at it is like life as a team sport and like, and what I've seen is that the people who, not to keep bringing up Joe Rogan but like he does a great job of seeing other people around him that are talented and using his celebrity to help elevate them and boost them. And I think that's just the way it has to go: if you if you're really if you really love someone or you really respect someone and you're working with them, you owe it to that person to like give them the leg up.
