LawBreakers was the same thing that was going to be free to play; they pivoted away from that. Well, I mean, I think that's the answer to the question right, yeah. We're already seeing the pivot away even for games that were started out being that... yeah, uh, yeah. I don't know. It's like I feel like I'm not informed enough to understand how big of a hit Paragon is sure cuz it sounds like we don't care but there's obviously people and when she's on here she talks nonstop about it and she's invested money in that. But I wonder how many people do... sure.

They started seeing you assume they never really talked about it what the return on investment was, what the current concurrence were, and it wasn't really there. Now, all that said, Marvel Heroes Omega on PlayStation 4 is technically free to play; you can jump in and play every character up until Level 10, I think, before you make your choice, um, and then you have to unlock and there's in-game currency, blah...
