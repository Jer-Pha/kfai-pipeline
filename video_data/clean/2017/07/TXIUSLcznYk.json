Uh, Jason Bateman plays a money launderer for a Mexican cartel, a drug cartel who's uh partner was skimming off the top and so basically he has to take it upon himself to figure out how to launder $500 million in five years for this cartel or they're going to kill him, holy crap!

I saw The Big Sick last night, the Keanu Reeves movie, it was pretty good, it was pretty good. Yeah, it is definitely being a little overhyped, um, it's solid story, it was cool, it was funny enough, uh, and it was like a good story, I think that they really nailed what it's like to be in a relationship for half the movie and then the other half I'm just like you really kind of like there's that the part where conflict begins I feel like wasn't earned.

Well, I'm hoping to see it this weekend. Um, I'm actually up in Tahoe visiting some family, so hopefully we can see it during the day.

Oh no, Genesis it was Genesis which was the reboot that like was supposed to like re-can the whole series and that was just a they cast that dude from uh The Planet of the Apes movie, that I'm not I'm like dude this guy's not a leading character anyway. Long story short, I don't know I'm I'm cautiously optimistic okay about this why not? What about you? I don't know I'm kind of over it.

Um, this your boy Ryan Georgia movie movie Mind Studios uh, the Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve is reportedly one of the filmmakers being considered to take the helm of James Bond 25 after two years of uncertainty following the release of the last James Bond film Spectre. The 007 franchise got back on track this weekend with the announcement of a November 29 release date by the film's producers and the reported return of Daniel Craig. He's coming back with Skyfall, Idris Elba was in the running to be the next inspector director Sam Mendes is out of the picture. The next big move for the production will be hiring of a new helmer and it appears that at least three candidates are in the running.",

For the time being, it appears the production has moved away from the idea of hiring Sherlock director Paul McGuigan as well as Christopher Nolan, a self-proclaimed Bond fanatic. Can you imagine if Christopher Nolan did it? I would be 100% on board with a Christopher Nolan James Bond movie; that would be great because he would make it like he would make the Bond film the seminal Bond film in my opinion.

Yeah, uh, I love those two guys together. So, I think he could absolutely tell a cool Bond story. All right, I don't know who the other guys are though, and I'm not familiar with...

No, no, you won't because here's the deal: A) you're going to be with all your friends; B) uh, there will you'll have beers; yeah, and C) you will have two human beings fighting to the death in front of you. It's not possible some Daman (Dana) White fight might be boring if he goes to the ground, but I don't think Tyron Woodley so he'll probably keep it on the feet. That dude looks like a monster; he's a monster. I've always seen him fight twice; um, I think you'll like it and the energy of Cormier vs Jones is going to be insane \u2013 awesome, I'm excited for the hype of it all for sure.

Um, I'm inching through. I don't think I'm capable of platinuming that game. The Relic challenges are just way too hard, man. Trying to beat Crash in one sitting, no man. Nah, um, okay. Good yeah. I'm not seeing any news about Jon Jones. Everybody wants Jon Jones is on you know he's on crazy watch 2017 so we're all just watching out for him. Let's all make sure we're tweeting nice things to Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier to make sure he doesn't mess up anything. Iden 91, who designed the Kinda Funny World Championship belt?

And to be clear with everybody um in the chat, I'm not giving up on the Platinum. I'm just saying I don't think I'm going to be able to get it, but that's going to be my lifelong legacy: that in the Amplitude Platinum, that shit's never happening. But I'm going to keep trying.
