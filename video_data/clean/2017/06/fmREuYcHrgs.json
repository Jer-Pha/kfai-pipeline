Because for me, my interaction has always started with: I talk to you through the podcast, I talk to you through video games, I talk to you through... you know, the content I produce is me starting the conversation, but then yeah, you know, usually you do follow up on Twitter or I'll pop into something or do that.

I want to be on the Reddit threads; I'm trying to help out wherever I can. Uh, and so by the time we came back, it had settled down, but then we had people in the community upset that normally wouldn't be upset. They were upset because we weren't there to talk to them, and that is something I didn't think about. I think I personally stayed away too long if that makes sense, but I could do what I needed for my own emotional landscape.
