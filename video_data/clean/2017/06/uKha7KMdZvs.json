Greg, that deal's got to be so bright, you've got to wear shades. They let me write this one, too. Don't mess around with a Greg shades. Oh no. MVMT sunglasses start at just $70 with the option to upgrade to polarized lenses. Those overpriced designer brands will run you an upwards of $200. MVMT figured out that by selling online, they were able to cut out the middleman and retailer markup, providing the best possible price. If you've ever watched a Kinda Funny barbecue, you know I do wear these. I do like them. They are good. I am wearing them on my face right now. Look me in the eyes and tell me if I'm lying. You can't because of the sunglasses. That's why you get sunglasses. You can lie to anybody you want. Get 15% off today with free shipping and free returns by going to mvmt.com/gregy.

Uh, my time might be wrong about that because good lord, I don't have any sense of time anymore. Time doesn't matter to us. Um, but pretty much we've been reading all of the feedback. We always do, but I mean, I don't want to say we I I want to try to be as factual about this as possible. I can say without shadow of doubt, I read as much feedback as humanly possible in all of the different communities.

And I'm not saying it's going to happen every day, everything, but it's like I think again a statement to where we are and where we're going is that hey, this is kind of chill right now. I can I can actually get in there and do stuff and not run off. And I mean my my thing and we're kind of jumping around here because the fifth is uh the fifth question.

You don't respond to negative things.\" It's like, \"All right, well, do you not want do you not see the 10 things 10 negative things that I responded to and tried to help?\" And it's just like, then what? I'm going to respond to that saying that it just it turns into a thing. I'm like, I'm now wasting my time. Like it goes back. It goes back to constructive criticism, right?

And I  think also for me, the reason that I like the Facebook group for example is I can just go in and like something and that is saying, hey, I saw this.

I'm just being honest about the way I consume things. But I understand that other people consume things differently. I grew up on forums. I grew up on the Q&A forums. I would go to the Mega64 show, Tonedeaf's show that I've talked about so many times that influenced Kinda Funny Live and I would know people there because I knew them from the forums.

However, I also know that I scrutinized every **** thing that **** said and that's why it scares me and I do not feel um pushed to respond to things because I know how I feel about it and it's hard to get that across and I I don't know.

Yeah. And it's I appreciate everything that that goes on there. It's just I don't see it the same way as I used to see things when I was in that community and I I've I feel like I've learned lessons from that community and that's how I go about things.

And what I'm excited about this is this went out to all of the different communities and our social push on Twitter and Facebook, like on our channels for that, not just the groups.

But this is coming from a time when a lot of people had a lot of issues and we wanted to hear about them. So instead of making things multiple choice or percentage based or number based or whatever, we were just like, \"Here's a question, give your answer.\" And that was a lot harder to get definitive numbers and data for, but Joey spent a lot of time breaking it down trying to find trends in words. Um, she would look at how many times certain words were used, what are the most common words used? She would then go in and figure out how in what context they're there. And I also read it all.

We heard them very loud and clear. Let's start over with number one. This was the one kind of quantifiable um answer. Yeah. What shows do you watch? Gogg. 77.8% of the people watch God of War. GamesCast 67.1%. Two too off. Two off. Two points off. Kinda Funny. Morning Show. 68.35. Wow. Wow. That's actually kinda funny morning show. Um 44% watch Kinda Funny, The Animated Series and 30% watch other and they could put whatever they wanted to put in there. The most common to least common responses were PS I love you let's plays everything love and sex stuff. Got it. So cool. There's some there.

Specifically, the iTunes numbers. So, um, that's but keep in mind too our numbers are down and then overall the numbers are down. Yeah. I don't want somebody to pick you apart like yeah. Yeah. What I'm saying about the morning show specifically, like there's a clear reason why the numbers are where they're at.

That's a real quantifiable statistic you can look at, which is why we're trying to make all these fixes. Uh, two, what do you want from Kinda Funny Games? There was 3,112 responses to this one. Um, a lot of people 111 times. You know what? Hold on. I'm going to do these in order. Okay. 668 is the most people want. Let's plays. Fun let's plays. You're getting no pressure, Candy Annie.

Um, I don't really know exactly where Andy and Danny lie when it comes to like Andy loves indie games like Gone and all that stuff. Uh, but anyways, Danny likes Irish things. Yeah. So, we'll have to figure that out. Um, shout out to his interview. Greg Miller interviews a lot of people talking about that in various forms. If I can be honest 100%, like I've said it before.

We want to make massage that into a real thing rather than do what we've done before where hey we're not ready but here's an announcement like no no we'll we'll work on that and stew on that and make a thing about it. Maybe it'll be maybe that can be the next limited run show after being with Greg. I love that idea. Uh, and then finally, the most common thing was with 111 responses, reviews. In-depth reviews.

We're not going to get a chance to talk about this in a timely fashion. So, let's do this. Let's play. Let's have this up and let's talk about it there. Right.

It's not who we are. Uh, when it comes to that, we're more critical of the news and of the announcements and the industry and things like that. Sure. Um, so that was Kinda Funny Games and VA and NVIDIA. Yes. What do you want from Kinda Funny? 2852 responses on this one. 568 times people talked about a movie show. They want movies. They want movies. And I we talked about this with the Morning Show. I think that that's kind of our answer to that to dabble into it and and see what a movie show could be in segments of that nature. Yeah. So that is exciting.",

I remember it was around last October when things got really bad in the different uh communities. And what's hard about this is we say this as if it's the entire community and it's not. It's just these very focused little branches of the the community were having issues and they all got upset and like that **** happens. Uh and I feel like we hired Joey as a response to that. And Joey's had so many great ideas that we need to enact. But it's like right now again, Joey got pulled away in a direction that we didn't want her or expect her to but needed her to.

We try our best to make them fun. Here's where it gets complicated. A lot of people like them, make them as short as possible and just get through them. Then a lot of people, oh, have fun with them. And we try to do both, obviously. Um, but it's hard because then you're displeasing one group and not the other or whatever. There's been a lot of changes with ads over the last couple years.

We do like maybe four to six times a year meetings where it's like, \"How's this working? How can we change it?\" Whatever. And I bring all the feedback of like, \"All right, they want it shorter. Oh, they want it in the beginning and middle of this.\" All this stuff that you guys talk about, it happens, but we can't make those changes until that next two months period or whatever because we've sold a specific thing and we've been trying to get better and better.

Sure. But it's still short and it's done. And it's punching, it's out.

So, I think that what we're going to do now is a bunch of our different content is going to have different strategies and we'll adapt from there. GameOverGreggy Show is going to have the before the show like we've been doing with the ad read. Oh, shoot. Um, Gamescast is going to I'm we're going to try to just put the ad in the middle. Um, but if the things are in the middle in the beginning, there needs to be like a quick shot of, \"Hey, this brought to you by this. Find out more later.\" Um, that doesn't work for everything. So, we're going to try that. And, um, we can't. A lot of people are like, \"Oh, you should just move the ads to the end of the shows.\" People won't buy that. Um, the advertisers don't want things",

So things like party mode we'll probably see that when it's time to party we will party hard. And then the other thing is a lot of people are like you should remove ads for Patreon supporters.
