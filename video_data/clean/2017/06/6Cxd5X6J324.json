All games will be better on it eventually, sure, yeah is what they're going forward all the games going backwards a couple of the big ones, sure. What are the gut reactions? Ouch did Phil Spencer not stick the landing on that? I mean I think in overall um you talked about it during the conference this conference was solid it was not a home run I don't think like somebody made a joke in here PlayStation just as long as they show up tomorrow they beat him I don't think it's that drastic or anything but I think this was a conference of like hey we have 42 games to show you today and hey a lot of them are going to seem a to",

It won't be 2018 that game will get pushed way out what will the final product look like, that's all I want. I just want to temper expectations. I don't know if it'll get push out that far cuz like do we know how long they've been working on it? I feel like they've been working on it as soon as Mass Effect 3 wrapped and the main team went on to work there, well that was the whole thing yeah Casey Hudson brought a team over there and then Casey Hudson left the team yeah so what did that mean like.

I'm just a damn impressive-looking game, and I loved the fact that they went from air to land to sea underneath and all three looked super awesome. The ME suit made it look fun to maneuver. That's what I'm saying: temper expectations; that was an amazing demo. We've seen that before \u2013 the first Watch Dogs trailer also looked really good. We've seen a lot of E3 demos that you eventually get in our fun games, but great games that just don't look or feel like that. Yeah, hopefully it isn't scaled down a huge amount, like Just Cause 4; I remember that. So here's my big question then: is anybody here going to buy an Xbox One X as of now? Absolutely not.

Um, it's just that it was definitely quantity over quality, I think, when it came to the titles, and looking at it, even things like Crackdown 3, like that didn't blow anyone away; I don't think that just it was okay, cool, it's real, and it's coming a lot sooner than we expected, sure. Um, and Sea of Thieves, a lot later than we expected. Same thing with State of Decay 2. I thought State of Decay was such a slam dunk for an October or September release; get it out in front of the holiday or Halloween, get it there, and stuff.
