Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver will feature local wireless connectivity to allow players to trade and battle with each other as they could in the original series. The titles will also be compatible with Pok\u00e9mon Bank, allowing you to transfer your collection of monsters to Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon, as well as the newly announced Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. Additionally, players can use the Time Capsule feature to trade Pok\u00e9mon from Red Blue and Yellow over to the second-generation titles originally released in 2000. And goes on to explain why this is a big deal. So uh people in the chat are bringing something very important to my attention: Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon came out last November, which was not a year",

But the console isn't taking away from PlayStation 4 sales Laden said when you look at our numbers I think it shows that a lot of gamers are a two-console family, and quite often those two consoles are PlayStation and Nintendo sitting side by side. In a separate interview with Glixel, PlayStation boss Jim Ryan said the Switch has is an interesting console, and added it's never a good idea to bet against Nintendo. It'll be interesting to see how they do this holiday; they're clearly out of stock. They've had some really big first-party franchises to support them - Zelda is so powerful, he said about Breath of the Wild.

Going back to IGN: guess what everybody? Oscar-winning Suicide Squad; it sequel should be getting shot next year. Uh, Alex Gilad says Suicide Squad should begin shooting sometime in 2018, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. Joel Kinnaman, who plays Rick Flag in the DC film, confirmed Warner Brothers is currently working on the script for the sequel: \"As far as I know they're writing the script and I think the plan is to shoot it sometime in 2018, but that can change,\" says Kinnaman. I think I'll definitely come back for it; I think I'll definitely come back for it.

What a brilliant idea! Great would have been great. I still haven't seen Wonder Woman or Baywatch. Yeah, oh Baywatch breaks my heart; I haven't seen that either.

Hellblade is about half the length of a regular AAA game and priced at about half the cost, a price that we think is fair to both you and us.
