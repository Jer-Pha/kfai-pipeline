So, my um, my topic is a deep philosophical one cunningly disguised as a question about Star Wars. I love it. Um, so my question is: Does Canon matter? And the reason I ask it is that there was obviously a lot of fuss around when Disney bought the Star Wars franchise and they deleted the whole Expanded Universe. My question is: Firstly, does it matter? Who should decide what is and isn't canon? And do we actually need someone else to tell us what's canon? For example, in Star Wars, I refused to believe that Boba Fett's background was Jango. You know, have you heard about Mandalore? My view is that you know I can take what I want from that if I want the Expanded Universe to be what happened and I hate to break it, but none of these things actually happened. So, your English, my friend.",

Okay yeah but all the same that if everything Rebels and all these different shows are tying into it I think there needs to be somebody because they made that decision that everything's going to be Canon right continuity right for me does Canon matter in comics has always been the thing I'm always Pro blowing up Canon, I don't think there should be a DC Universe, I think that there should be Max Landis's Landis verse and if he wants to come back and tell stories isn't it great if if somebody else is like hey I'd love to",

But it's that kind of broader idea I think you know, oh, I don't like that element, and therefore it's just going to ruin the whole thing. Another great example of continuity working, I think.

I think Nick, your point is exactly right - you create a great Batman film, you created a great Superman film, you create a great Wonder Woman film, focus on those, and then the momentum starts to build, it starts to attract some speed, and then you can do other things, like Marvel did with Guardians, like no one knew Guardians before.",

And like Guardians isn't so what does that mean I wonder to them as a director? What is WB promising Josh Weden just like do whatever you want?
