So for me personally as a fan, it was great to watch you guys go from that just a table at PAX to seeing you on that show. What's it like to be watching that happen? Terrifying! Yeah, I mean State of Decay was a labor of love by a very small, passionate team in downtown Seattle. Uh, we were entering a genre that's crowded \u2013 you know, when you announce that you're making a new zombie game, the reaction is \"do we need another zombie game?\" Right? And uh, you know, we always said yes! By the way, well, you know, we thought it was because uh, we wanted to capture something new right. We wanted to focus more on the survival fantasy aspect rather than the the zombie killing aspect right and make it more of a simulation so we",

Now was that always your vision for the team and what you wanted to do or was it Xbox really believing in you guys and wanting you to be a big part of the Xbox One? Well I think it's a combination of both, uh, you know we still aren't done right, we uh, we very much believe in the power of what we call the survival fantasy genre. Right this is not about killing zombies, it's about giving you the tools in your toolbox to go put your own Survival plan into action, right? I mean I I know that you've probably sat around with your friends and talked about what your plan is and I I think everybody here probably believes that in the zombie apocalypse they would survive.

So, for the fans that are watching at home, that are fans like me, what are the big differences for State of Decay 2? Because I basically I've seen the two trailers, and I've read what you guys have put up on the blogs, but how do you summarize what's different this time around, you know? Um, we didn't decide to take it in bold new directions. Yeah, right. We have a formula that works, and you always straddle the line when you're making a sequel to a game that was successful between just reusing and rehashing what you've already done, sure, um, and doing so much new that you kind of disengage and disenfranchise from where you were. So fundamentally, we wanted to listen to what the players said they wanted and make that game. We had this grand vision way back in the day; you may have seen it.",

We had this Grand Vision way back in the day; you may have heard about Class 3, Class 4 - uh, and Class 4 was going to be a big kind of open world right? And with the success of the of the State of Decay we thought, \"No, let's not do what we think we want to do. Let's do what our fans are asking for,\" and what they were asking for was uh more polish, yeah right, uh larger world, uh deeper simulation, deeper mechanics of uh character, uh and base options, and Co-op multiplayer - by Far and Away the number one thing that people wanted to see so State of Decay 2 is that game. It is a uh you know we had the opportunity to say what works, what doesn't work, where do we want to innovate uh and kind of blend all that together with the feedback we got from our fans and make a uh you know a full uh a full sequel to the game yeah so how does multiplayer work this time how",

And that can help bail you out. The game will reward you substantially for helping people out, but you're also taking that risk of putting one of your survivors into a dangerous environment. Perma death counts. I'm bringing over the survivor I'm playing at per death always counts all right. Wow, that's interesting - that's interesting.

Were those things you wanted to try or were they just things you wanted? What has made its way from that into State of Decay 2? It's an astute question. Um, I'm a student of the game, big fan of this game. Did you know that you knew that yes you so uh, you know the answer is that um, there's a spectrum in these games between being a pure sandbox simulation uh at one end of the spectrum and at the other end being a very uh linear lead you around by the nose narrative right with just some mechanics in between. And State of Decay was successful because it's at least partially because we blended between those two.

Bigger uh, you know right now there are three maps roughly the size of the original game. Oh wow, okay yeah that's so good yeah. And you know beyond that uh, it's just deepening of the system so you have more options even as you play within those maps uh. For example, the traits that determine each survivor's unique abilities and skills uh in the first game there were a couple hundred maybe there are well over a thousand in State of Decay 2 uh. And the combinatoric effects of that pretty much ensure that every Survivor you find uh and invite into your community is going to be unique and they're much more tightly integrated into the base mechanics and the overall simulation too so you'll feel like the impact they're having on the world is much greater.",

You know, when I started the studio uh and especially uh brought in uh you know the first uh colleagues of mine who were going to be working on this with me uh we had a pretty singular vision right.
