I'll be honest or I'm so soulless down there. That's not what you said it right; wonderful people, but there is an essence, and that essence is embodied by the people who have been working on this game - they're like that work with Lucasfilm. I did not expect or know that I was going to deal with them, and I've never felt more comfortable and safe being my true super emotional nerdy self, one of my favorite things in life.

How is nerd culture stunting or how is nerd culture stunting the advancement of nerd culture by its dedication to nostalgia and fanservice? Yeah, that's my time. You think that's what's happening yes and what give me some examples. Give me two concrete um what Spider-Man are we on okay we're I mean why did you wish reboot number are we on three this is the third lucky number three yeah third iteration if they say I can't don't care no more do you feel like he's like you can't care because you're like you're looking at that you think look like fans are being too harsh on these series that's why we're giving these reboots or no there's been a style to come into play okay so here's the okay so we we all know that the way",

I was driving in today there's a little movie theater over there, wait, little old Peter, and it's playing Guardians of the Galaxy - and Pirates of the Caribbean 5. This is the third movie playing there, but I just saw those two and I thought to myself, \"Like interesting.\" And I had that exact same feeling. I'm like, man, Hollywood has to make sequels to everything. You think back to Guardians and I would argue that Guardians is not an established franchise, not very great. I think Guardians is a great example of the advancement of CGI, but it's difficult because I think that like obviously there's got to be some diehard Guardians of the Galaxy fans out there before the movie was made, I'm sure there were what there are now more so now than before.",

But I would look at that and say okay, that's you have to have that like that strong base of it's unfortunate you have to have the Avengers too in the Iron Man theories and all those all the movies that we know are going to be good but not great but are trading off of that nostalgia and off of that sort of fan base already in order to take the week forward with the Guardians. Here's how nerd culture is timing nerd culture, it's the fact that all of our nerdy activities only continue to expand and proliferate and there's too much to do in the way that I want to go home and play Final Fantasy XIII, catch the new comic books, and you know finish House of Cards and do all these different things to the point of yeah when a new movie comes out am I going to go see it but if",

By the way, I am Shawn Hanlon. I am NOT the only person who tried [to do that]. No, I'm blah blah blah, like I'm sure there I'm sure there were 100 other people that called to try to license that thing before they actually okay but that is an example of like yes come on let's get there let's do it because otherwise one of our what are your kids gonna you want the sad fact is they'll be doing the same thing because it's all mean I've they cannot go if they",

So hot, so I don't even consider it once it's gone to full saturation; that **** is not ours anymore. But I don't feel like it necessarily has to be. I think Transformers is an example unfortunately that it wasn't ours to begin with once it hit the silver screen, like the 1984 Transformers movie was for the people who loved Transformers, the 2007 one and beyond, not for them at all; that was for mass consumption to get as many people to buy tickets as possible. And I think that when it comes to things like Spider-Man stuff, it's all about timing where the Sam Raimi movies they had to work as movies more than they had to work as nerd culture things because they had to prove it; they could do it. Yeah, I don't think that's a bad thing.",

It's that from the creator of The Walking Dead, never Invincible. It's always gonna work. Yeah, he's a badass. Make some shows us that this will work. It won't work dollar signs. It won't work. Oh, The Walking Dead didn't work. I don't know what I honestly think. I hope we see the Invincible movie. I'm not sure we're ever gonna see this movie. I think this is the one that will happen. Okay, it'll be good. See, I hope it'll be good. Conner, I don't think we see it any time for 2020. No, no. I don't even know. Got a long time to live. All right. Oh cool. Oh geez.
