And this allowed the guy doing the demo to ride the bike in the open world for a bit and kind of just maneuver around. It looks huge, like it reminded me of Horizon; and so many people have been saying that Days Gone looks like The Last of Us, with just a lot of enemies. I think that's what last year's demo did. This year's demo, especially the one I just saw, the world is super vast, super open. And seeing him traverse with the motorcycle really reminded me of how fun it was to just move around Horizon. Okay, so I was like, \"That's super cool.\" And there's so many surprises that would come up that it shocked me how much of a difference the snow made for that mission. Uh, they went there was like the traps that we saw were still there; he just went a totally different way with a whole other set of ambushes and different things going on. Okay, so when he goes to that part where",

And the motorcycle - the same way the motorcycle starts off there's a your health meter but then there's also a gas meter so that kind of limits how far you can uh get uh in in the world but then eventually you're able to go a lot farther, a lot faster, and uh travel that way. But yeah, there's like so much crafting, so much skill trees - it seems like everything has a level up system. It's the thing about Days Gone is knowing Sony Bend and obviously giving Eric Jellerson so much all the time I've kept my ear to the ground on it. And we when it debuted last time you know at the last E3 they showed the trailer, and it's him on the motorcycle - I was excited about that when they showed the freaker stuff, it was that thing of like is that what this game is going to be like? I don't think so, it's not the way you guys describe it's not the way PlayStation describes.",

He's like, \"that is an example of the dynamic stuff that can happen, that can happen anywhere, that can happen when you're just traveling going down the street or whatever, or like in the woods.\" There could be a mob if that mob hears another mob it can turn into a swarm really quick wherever you are in the game. So it was a set piece that we saw last year but that set piece can happen anyway. It's interesting. I honestly believe knowing their pedigree, knowing those guys and liking what I've seen in that game and being a zombie guy, I really feel like Days Gone has a chance to come out and have expectations low and really hop over it and be a game that no... no you're it's a Horizon: Zero Dawn get in there builds your character builds your thing do it does it really does seem that way. Like I again going back to what I was saying earlier, I think going into it everyone says The Last of Us, I think going",

Um I I was really impressed by it. Um what blows my mind is Sony Bend has 100 people compared to a lot of the other Sony teams that they were talking about, which was four 500 people for and they're like they're firing on all cylinders for this game, they've been working on it for a long time I heard Eric Joffe did it all himself yeah and uh a good question to to wrap this up uh Marty asked what's the difference between last year and this year like what's changed in this game and he's like honestly nothing has changed, this we've been building on this what we showed last year was just to kind of like have people understand this is what makes our game different yeah you've seen zombie games before you've seen zombie TV shows movies everything but having this kind of World War Z thing like we've",
