The movie was **fantastic**, so happy with it. I went in here's my thing when it comes to Spider-Man: I've read countless comics; I've watched almost all of the shows all the way through, some I couldn't make it through. Um, but that's okay because when it comes to the movies, looking back now, obviously The Raimi Trilogy is very important; sure, and no one would argue that Spider-Man 2 isn't one of the best superhero movies of all time. Sure, Spider-Man 1 does not hold up at all, and it was me and Kevin were having a conversation about this last night: I really feel like it we thought it was so good because that's all that we had at the time, and it was good at the time because of that, and that alone; it was not a good movie, and nothing about it was perfectly Spider-Man.

However, that movie was a mess because it was trying to build a universe and it couldn't; it was trying to build Sinister Six, it was trying to build the whatever black and silver whatever they're called these days - I think Spider-Man: Homecoming did so well is everything I loved about any of the previous Spider-Man movies but it was put into a universe that already existed, so we didn't need to worry about building; the building was already there and then it got to take it a step further. No origin story - oh, so good; didn't need to retread; we know, we know who Spider-Man is, and they treated us with respect, and I think they nailed it. It's so interesting too because I read",

I don't want to get into spoiler territory yet, but there was moments that I was like, \"Oh my God,\" like I am seeing a clear growth in this character throughout this movie. And it wasn't just from beginning to end; he's a different person. It's like throughout the movie decisions are being made that I'm like, \"This is all building towards.\" That's the thing I think the biggest compliment to give the picture is the fact that not only is it an awesome superhero movie, it's an awesome movie in terms of character growth... in terms of me watching it.
