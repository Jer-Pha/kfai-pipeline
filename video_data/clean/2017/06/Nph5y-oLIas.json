The first news story comes from Jason Schreier over at Kotaku. Sources say Mass Effect Andromeda will not get single-player DLC.

BioWare also shelved plans for a sequel to Mass Effect: Andromeda, sources said, while reporting that news I'd been pretty sure that Mass Effect: Andromeda wouldn't be getting single-player DLC; there are a few people left who could work on it, but I wanted to be more confident, so over the past weeks I've confirmed the news with three sources familiar with the company's plans, all of whom spoke anonymously so as not to jeopardize their careers.

Mass Effect: Andromeda will not be getting single-player DLC. What are your thoughts, Andrea? This is a big old bummer. I was really looking forward to getting back into Andromeda post-patches and revisiting it and hopefully having a better experience the second time around. And I was going to wait for the DLC as like a motivator for me to go back to it, cuz I still have so many games that I have yet to play this year. It's not surprising; I mean we heard earlier this year that the studio had been downsized uh post-launch, which is normal most studios do downsize after they ship their game because they just don't need that many people anymore. But when those reports originally came out, the suspicions were there was DLC even coming at all, is you know the plans for the next Mass Effect in jeopardy what does",

So BioWare is a big studio and they have multiple branches, but they're not that big right? So I have to imagine that if they're going to work on Mass Effect again it's not going to be for a couple of years at the earliest. What's your read on Anthem? It's really early to tell. Um, I like the idea, I like the idea of like a space opera Star Warsy sci-fi instead of like the super hardcore sci-fi you know that story kind like the military Soldier Side it's more of right yeah exactly and so I I like that from a storytelling perspective I think that it's going to make for really great characters.

Next question comes from Brody: With the existence of the PlayStation 4 Pro and the Xbox One X, which have appeared Midway through a console generation - do you think we'd ever see a console and its pro version released at the same time? Like, PS5 and PS5 Pro are released on the same day. I don't think under that guise right now.
