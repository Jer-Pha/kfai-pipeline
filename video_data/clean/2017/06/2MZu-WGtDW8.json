Also produced 52 episodes of Arrested Development and narrated them, which is fantastic. Narrator in the Han Solo movie, so he is done. For anyone who who is not necessarily familiar with Ron Howard, his credits include Parenthood, Splash, Backdraft, The Da Vinci Code, Apollo 13, and 2001: A Beautiful Mind - uh, about the brilliant antisocial math mathematician John Nash, won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb right now with absolutely zero information; he is the only Academy Award-winning director to direct a Star Wars film.

But it was definitely like it's getting a call back. It's Friday night; it's time to party. Who you get to call Friday night? And I all right, we're calling Jurassic World. Jurassic World, what's Jurassic World doing tonight? What are they doing tonight? Are they getting some drinks? Maybe we should party with Jurassic World. Would you rather party with Jurassic World or Jurassic Park? Jurassic Park either is the answer to that. I don't know why I post that question. I don't know if either is lost in my own... my own... my own dream world here. The narrative is getting lost for sure. It is getting lost. So, the movie is called Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.",

I haven't read the script kind of, this kind of acting is bad for actors like it's the same thing happened with Johnny Depp, you get in there, you get become one character and it just... goes into all that Mark Walberg really good, we got to save them okay, say mother for me, all right. Hey, say hello to your mother for me. Bumblebee, hey. Who wants some protein? You guys ever heard of C-3PO? You came from the Moon, right? Do you guys know how tall I am? Nobody knows how tall I am.
