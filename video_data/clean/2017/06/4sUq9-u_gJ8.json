Yeah, I think we got that part. We didn't need the translation. The film was due to play in 3D with subtitles and had gathered 237 confirmed guests on the Facebook page as in Lebanon where the movie was banned May 31st. The Tunisian Association of Young Lawyers filed a lawsuit on the grounds that Gal Gadot had publicly praised Israel's military actions during the 2014 war in Gaza.

A festival organized to celebrate the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, but it was unclear whether Gadot's background was the issue. But another guy whose name I won't butcher for you, head of press at M'Dahbi (co-organized the Algerian Festival), said the film was pulled because of administrative issues linked to exhibition wrestling. A petition to boycott the film in Algeria called \"No to Wonder Woman\" was launched last week after Lebanon's band was passed; it's all these we're losing two theaters here, a third theater there, 237 tickets here - yeah, I mean it's not going to affect the global box office of Wonder Woman.",
