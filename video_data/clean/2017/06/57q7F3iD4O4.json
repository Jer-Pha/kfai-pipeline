We told Kyle the developer how much we loved it. We played the original Emily is Away all the way through, and what we did was we said, \"Hey, we were originally going to do 15 minutes,\" but the game was too good; we couldn't stop playing it, so we're going to play this one all the way through if you watch the entire thing. If you watch the entire let's play, buy the game - there are multiple endings this time around, so hey, it's going to be worth playing.",
