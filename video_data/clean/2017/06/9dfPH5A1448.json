We decided to go out to this fancy French restaurant I was about to say \"rest in peace,\" yeah, called Jardini\u00e8re. I'm not sure starts with a \"J\" and ends with some \"er\" and like \"Franklin\" and like \"Fank,\" yeah, it's around there. It's on Bush Grove Street, so it was there. And we walked by recently, and she was just like, \"Oh, let's go there. It's really nice.\" My cool boyfriend booked that reservation that night. I was like, \"I know what's up with this.\" We go there, it's just me, her, her sister, and her sister's boyfriend. And we walk in, and immediately I'm like, \"Didn't even think about how fancy this place was.\" Inspired by the opera, by the way. Exactly. I was wearing a button-up shirt, so I lucked out there. But totally could have been wearing exactly this outfit, and they'd be fine. But we realized it's San Francisco; there's nowhere in San Francisco that you have to dress up. You wear fancy shorts.",

I'm like, \"Oh, I didn't dress something\"; I'm like, \"No, best thing about San Francisco is you can see a person be like they either own Facebook or they're a college student - no idea, absolutely no one knows, no one cares.\" But I go in and I was a little early, and uh, the bartender hands me the menu to look at, and I very quickly realize I'm going to need some help; I'm going to need some Googling. And I hope that when people come here - my like, my group - that they are a little more well-versed in this stuff because I don't know what 90% of the words in this menu are - escargot was like a French SL; it was French, but then even a lot of the words they're just fancy food words.
