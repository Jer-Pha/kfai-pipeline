If it was a single franchise I would definitely say that it's not is my favorite franchise now we haven't gotten a 3D sandbox Mario game in a long time, yes for Super Mario 64 or Mario Sunshine, yeah and then the Galaxy games were fantastic but they were kind of a weird in-between where there were a lot more linear than yes they had that - yeah the devs actually described it as a miniature garden which is a good answer incorrectly but haha Konami okay therefore a miniature garden which is what they do and they very interesting design, very particularly how they design it so you can just go and explore discover everything in this condensed space, yeah. Can I try to create so what's the philosophy then for going back to the other style they just want it why do something different that using the hat the whole thing McAfee a different exploration aspect",

They want to create something that people could just really have fun with and be completely lost at the same time, just be surprised as we're going through the whole game like jumping up pack people so look at as a trailer, it was absolutely foglar, yeah starting off with that T-Rex and all of that like that what where did that type of inspiration come from? The devs actually, from what I got for my R stands like they really decided one person to kill it was the idea of capturing that hold capture mechanic and then they basically just asked that anyone comes with any idea that you come up with and they had a bunch and they basically chose their favorites",
