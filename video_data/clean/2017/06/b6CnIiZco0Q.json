Greg can I just start the show by saying I feel vindicated that Days Gone was playable at E3. I'm so furious at Eric Holmes that he did not say \"oh Greg you're a judge why don't you play this\" that's why you didn't get nominated for anything Eric, you're asleep at the wheel, John Garvin, asleep at the wheel all of you next time yeah when you're a judge yeah you start the conversation at the booth and say I'm a judge what do I get to play and they'll be like come to our private air-conditioned room with snacks and play these games no one else gets to play okay maybe you should just you should I'll get the I'll get the robes next time in the gavel and then you can walk around with like a clipboard be like excuse me this is Greg Miller's judge please get out of the way um",

Yeah, the exploration elements of that game are something that I hope they show more of in the near future because what they showed at E3 didn't really feel like exploration; it felt like okay there's some coins over here and I'm grabbing the coins and then I'm now I'm in another battle arena. Um, and they really tried to emphasize that the game is split between strategy and exploration but I didn't see the exploration so they really have to step that up.

Where you're playing with your phone, making choices together, and then moving it around, and everybody gets hidden agenda cards. So you're playing and making choices based on that. It sounds fascinating, and I'm glad other people saw it and loved it as much as I do. The idea from what I heard is number two on the Roper Report. Shawn Layden is saying games can come out whenever they want to, and it doesn't matter. Over at Golem.in, there's this quote: \"Games are a bit of a business, and timing is very important.\" By the end of the year, people simply have more money. But it changed a little with Horizon Zero Dawn, for example, which was released in February and very successful. Batman Arkham",

Horizon Zero Dawn, for example, was released in February and was very successful. Batman: Arkham Knight came out a few years ago right after E3, and the demand for it almost exploded. We can now publish really high-quality games almost at any time; it is difficult if almost at the same time a stellar game appears as was the case with last year's business. Can big AAA Games come out whenever? Andrea, you're saying forever it was you're coming out maybe in spring or you're coming out in the fall and you're going to compete with everybody in November, and it's going to be a bloodbath; yes, and no, yes. It doesn't matter the quarter that you come out in as much as it used to. We're seeing really giant tent-pole AAA games being released in Q1 and Q2, where traditionally those were reserved for Q3 and Q4, in particular for holiday, but you can't",

But you can't just release them willy-nilly; you kind of have to look and see what else is coming out in that release window because you don't want to stack a game that has a very similar competitor too close to each other. We saw this last fall with Battlefield and Titanfall 2, and Duty all coming out within three weeks of each other, and clearly all three of those games suffered in overall sales because there was too much choice. Most gamers can't afford to buy three games in a month; if you're a big shooter fan, you'd like to space out your $60 purchases absolutely. And so I don't think that they can come out whenever they want; there needs to be some thoughtful decision as to these release dates and some strategy involved but I get what he's saying yeah well I mean they've seen so much",

But comparing it to other games in the space that are similar in style to that game, I can only say like, \"Hey, look at what these people over here are doing.\" How is it that you're working on this massive license Game of Thrones, and this is what you're going to put out for it? Yeah, you know. I was disappointed. No, I'm with you.

Does Sony need to have better messaging on VR game/experiences like this and Ghostbusters, which have brand power behind them despite their quality? I'm not saying this trailer should have been on the stage D3, but heck, they could have thrown in the pre-show. Do you think Sony needs to bring things like these to the forefront to show that they are actively supporting VR and catch the attention of the public that would love to swing around as Spidey? Do you think they need more tie-ins and experiences like this?
