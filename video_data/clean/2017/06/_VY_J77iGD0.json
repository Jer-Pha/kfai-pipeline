I'm like, all right, that sounds interesting. I want to know more about that. Um, I thought they did a good job of teasing Star Wars Battlefront II, telling you, \"You get back to it\" thirty minutes later, which sounded great in the beginning, then we got the thirty minutes, and we liked that wasn't great; that was not a good idea. Um, then you get into stuff that's going to be hit or miss for people, right? Where it's like Battlefield 1 was like talking to your Battlefield One audience, which isn't us necessarily. We like the single-player stuff. It seems like we're getting more of that. The only note I have for FIFA is whatever; because FIFA is not my game. Need for Speed looked interesting to me.",

I mean when like you can play it online, I'll never play that online right. Like that is a game I want to be next to Tim playing or next to Jen playing or next to maybe Andy playing it that way and seeing what he's up to and what's going on. You know what I mean? Like I think it's a really cool novel concept, I think it's awesome. I enjoy the fact that it, it does look budget in the sense of it's not going to be this sprawling 20 hour experience. It looks like it's more movie length and I think that's super cool because do something different with gameplay, do something unique that we're not seeing in a million other places and really focus on making that experience tight and",

Is that they just wanted to showcase it? Is that you know, is there a deeper relationship there? Is it just service level because PlayStation was all over a whole bunch of the trailers, they were yeah, especially the Star Wars stuff. Um, I think we definitely got a preview today of what we're going to be seeing a lot of this weekend and this week, which is hey, we're mentioning Scorpio, look at what it can do for the fabric, and that doesn't matter at all but really it's about the gameplay they keep reiterating the fact that like what it does for how it feels is what's important, and we'll see how much they can show us that not just tell us that come Microsoft's conference.

Yeah, um, going through the Battlefield 1 name of the Star in September looks cool. Uh, if it seems like there's a story chapter in it that that's exciting to me all the multiplayer stuff not necessarily for me so that's cool. Um, I don't think they did a good job talking about that Seed thing, the new team for Visionary Experience, yeah exactly, what was it?

Need for Speed, I feel like we haven't gotten a Need for Speed in a while but I'm sure I'm wrong about that because they just come and go so fast, well that's the thing is like so many other are forgettable this one, I mean again I'm not a car racing guy it looked beautiful and like we were watching like oh this",
