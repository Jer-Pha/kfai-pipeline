And once again, the Hispanic heartthrob, Andy Cortez. I'm still here. You are. What's going on? And Nick's here, too. Hi. Hey. So, what we're going to do is we're going to start this by declaring \"Smells Like...\" our Kinda Funny Game of the Show E3 2017. And it is Greg. We're doing it on the count of three all at the same time. One, two, three. Spider-Man. It was Spider-Man. That's awesome. Just got announced, Andy. It's not It's not Spider-Man from a leak on his on his Twitter. Yeah. Marvel's Spider-Man is upon PlayStation 4. It is our game of the year. Game of E3. Game of the show. It's the end of E3. We're very tired, but we're uh so game of the show is Spider-Man. There was uh other contenders though. I voted Mario. Let's have that talk. Yeah. So, going down the line, who",

So, going down the line, who voted for what? I voted for Spider-Man. I also voted for Spider-Man. I voted for Mario. But here's what I want to say is that multiple times this E3, people came up to me and said, \"What is your game of the show? What's the best thing you saw?\" And I kept saying, \"I don't know. I don't have an answer.\" This is the first E3 in a long time where I didn't have a clear winner. This is my answer. Because not because everything was meh, but so many games were so good. I think I could have answered that question a million different ways. So I've voted for Mario. I threw my support behind Mario. Well, I still think I would have made a case for the Last Day of Us, but none of you played it. Mhm. So in your face. Yeah. And then Nick, I got to go with Spider-Man. Spider-Man looked good.

Uh, Spider-Man's got the hype, man. It's got the hype. It's got the hype, too. But my one thing I mean, the one thing I'll say about Spider-Man, other than I hate the costume, I'm glad it changes at some point. White spider. I don't like the white spider at all.

He's like, \"I'm not ready to talk about that.\" Meaning that yes, you'll be able I think the costumes are gonna be modular in some respect and everyone's Spider-Man will look somewhat different. I think somewhat different. I think big white spider is going to be there no matter what. And I'm fine with that when I can make the suit look a little bit different because when it's got the red on and the white and the blue, that's too much.

So, I was doing an Instagram live stream on our Instagram, the Kinda Funny Vids Instagram. is the one and then Tim called me and I was like **** I can't answer the I can't end the video because it's being covered by the answer or rejection. So I rejected ended the stream called you back and you were like what's your game of the show? Uh he's like it's between Spider-Man and Mario and I said the only reason I said Spider-Man is because I feel like Mario is more of a game that impresses you. It impresses you more if you play it. Like it yeah it's pretty and it looks great or whatever and you know their graphics are you know they're cute and **** like that. Yeah, it's kind of blows my mindually blew my mind suit.

You know what I'm saying? So for me, it was between Spider-Man and Detroit for me. Hold on. That's a great contender, too. That is on my list, too, because I play Detroit and like the demo, but we'll get to that in a second. Let me be a hater in the comments, then. Sure. Oh yeah, you got to play Mario because it's got gameplay, not just quicktime events. I don't agree with that. To be fair, we don't know if Mario has quick time events. Shut up.

This is a suggested prompt down here. This is something else here. Yeah. I mean, I said this on yesterday's Games House recap and the Spider-Man thing that we did for the conference reacts, but I don't like that in the bottom of the screen. It's a constant prompt of buttons cuz it makes it seem like even the combat is quick time. I hope that they get rid of that. They're going to definitely change it.

It was also talking to Brian too. He was like today he was saying that like they wanted to make sure they had a HUD in this for the E3 demo to make sure that people believed it was real. Yeah. And it's one of those things I'm sure it'll be like Zelda where you can turn it off or Arkham turn it off. Well, I Yeah. I mean, I don't know. We'll see.

I didn't dig Beyond: Two Souls, right? Like I didn't even I put in a couple hours, right? But Heavy Rain is one of my favorite games ever. Yeah.

And uh, yeah, Detroit is just so stunning. I can't believe how good that game looks. Yeah, we did a whole react on Detroit, so you can watch that for more detailed information. But my thing was, Detroit was in the running for my Game of the Show. Like, it's definitely in the top 10 or like top five even.

Sure. You know, and here's here's what it kind of reminded me of. I I immediately had the flashbacks of like, oh, these are obviously these are big stars, right, as main characters. But for some reason, I couldn't help but think of the Swedish actors trying to play Americans in Heavy Rain and where you could totally tell that they're hiding an accent. You know, it kind of there was some cheesy writing here and there, but good lord, like I cannot wait to play that game.

He said it's about to hit alpha. That's what I was saying. I mean, in my head, that's what I was saying in my head, is the fact that it's okay to pass Detroit for game of the show this time, cuz next year we could probably give it to Game.

Like yeah you did man you **** up. No that's that's super awesome. Uh so Andy what else did you get to play today? I played Far Cry 5 today. Um really think I really really dug it.

You can mark a target and say like, \"Hey, kill this dude.\" Um, and the pilot I didn't mess with. Um, but I did the same thing. I just shot a bunch of people. I told her to kill people.

Um and then I flew an airplane and in real life ran out of the airport the controls were standard controls like non-inverted so it was really weird so I had to switch it up. Um but yeah you're one of them too? No, no, no, no. I'm a standard FPS like but flight. Stop saying one of them in flight. In flight I need actual flight controls. Oh, cuz it makes sense.

This is the big struggle they're going to have. But I thought this was going to be the one that makes it really serious. So anyway, what's kind of cool is that once you free that town, everybody who was driven out by these fanatics slowly starts coming back in and they're like, \"Hey, we're taking our city back, right?\" Yeah.

I had fun. Yeah. No, Crackdown is fun. Um it's but it's definitely not they're not going for a high level of depth uh with a lot of their a lot of the gameplay and things like that. It's more just about just the sheer fun of like going around and blasting things and throwing things at people. Um, but I really actually I really like the mechanic. I think it's going to be",

I haven't followed it long enough, but I think it's competitive. That's what I took away from what I read, but it was real brief. I think they mentioned something about that, too. I apologize.

But uh we gave out nine kind of funny approved awards. We should at the end of this we'll get to all those. But uh South Park playing it it is so awesome. I love the grid system. I love the combat.

There was a lot going on where there was with the multiple characters being able to attack and hide behind things, but then also the warp pipes really added an extra dimension to it where you could do the whole XCOM thing where you move through someone and attack them and then use another one of your characters to jump off and give you an extra move. You can do that extra move, find a warp pipe, warp into it. So, it's like one turn can have about five actions.

This is what Sonic should be in 3D gameplay.\" And Forces is going back to that pretty much exclusively besides the classic Sonic stuff, you know, which was all right.

Like, I liked hearing about the character for you. I don't know if you guys know anything about it. Give us what you scuttlebutt from the internet, the apology, and that's it. taking that aside, the concept of what the story is is you live in a world where basically everyone's on social media all the time and it's in your head like, right, you have augments in your brain where so instead of having a phone, you're basically just always there, you know, Snapchatting live, whatever the **** Automation has taken over.

So, she was like, you know, going to be great at gardening, but she's terrible at fighting. So, don't send her out for scavenging and send this athletic guy out whose stats are maxed out.
