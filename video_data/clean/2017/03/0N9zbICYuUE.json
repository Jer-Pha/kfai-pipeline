All of that is true. I was surprised by that, of course. I went to that preview event and did a preview here on the Gamescast, and I left that preview event super stoked, and I still am very much so. I mean, especially after last night. I think part of the reason Night One didn't knock it out of the park for me was that I was again playing what I already played.

Like, it's very interesting because of course this game is going to be compared to Horizon and Zelda right, and all these other open-world RPGs you know? However you want to classify Zelda, but you know what I mean, open-world RPGs, and all these different things. Um, and the fact that all three of these games - I think the thing I've talked about in the reviews that I don't think I usually ever talk about is discovery and exploration, and that being what this is, and how each one of these games does it so differently. Whereas Horizon was, \"I got to expand this entire map and see what's going on over here, cool,\" and then there's some new machines but they're all in the same vein. Zelda is - I have no",

Do you think that that kind of framing you or even going into No Man's Sky and that was was interesting, that's why honestly it was one of those really refreshing moments when we review games, and I shouldn't even say that when we used to review games at IGN, it was very much cool, I'm sequestered for the most part, maybe I'll talk to somebody else in the office who's playing it, but I don't, I'm the guy who's going to have this opinion.

Like, but one more thing when you start compiling it, oh this is weird, getting things out of a crate, and this is what the inventory screen looks like, and these faces look weird. Now again, what I'm saying though, to what you know, is that I never can vaguely remember what inventory and getting things out of crates in Mass Effect one was - everyone hated the inventory wheel, right?

I saw somebody say on today in one of the articles that it was like wonky, but I don't think it's wonky; I think it controls the way you'd expect it to. It drives like the Batmobile Tumbler, not the Batmobile tank we all hate - like it was cool, like you're struggling to get up a hill, you drop it into six-wheel mode or whatever it is and go up there and take off and beat the **** out of everything; it's great.

I love the idea of the way I've been scanning things to get the research points. You know, I made this badass assault rifle last night, and I also, uh, forget what level I am right now in the game, I want to say eight or nine, but I had already had enough points to completely max out my assault rifle tree because there's so much stuff to do.

Sure, ladies and gentlemen, this has been the Kinda Funny Gamescast until next time. I love you; come watch me play Mass Effect this week every Monday - why do I keep saying every weekday? 9:00 a.m. we say every Monday, and that's wrong; it's every weekday, yeah, 9:00 a.m. till start. You know why I'm **** it up? The Switch is uh the alliteration I was thinking Mass Effect Mondays, but you were saying Mass mornings - Mass Effect mornings back on my head. I think of the M man.
