You know, GameOverGreggy himself, Greg Miller, big fan of his show on Instagram, cooking with Greg, you can find him on the little hashtags and stuff; he's a big fan of cooking and stuff. Blue Apron has been really helpful with that because here's the deal: they send you little recipe sheets, all the things that you need; you can make each meal within 40 minutes or less. Tell me that's not a good deal, Kevin. It's a great deal, it is! So, here's the deal: they are the number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service in the entire country. It is their goal to make incredible home cooking accessible to everybody, and that includes me; I haven't used it yet personally, but that's just because I'm just really not into cooking and stuff. But Greg, Greg's been loving it. Kev, have you used this? No, I haven't. But Paula really wants to get it. Oh, we got",

But besides that, the buttons and D-pad were great. So uh, the thing is though, like all to get my Wii U was a smash post machine for the most part right, and that meant I had the two GameCube controller adapters, eight GameCube controllers; I was set plus the game pad. But then for Mario Kart, that meant you needed four Pro controllers or like nunchucks, and we were there was too many options for controllers that nobody liked. Whereas with the Switch now, there's a bunch of options for controllers that people do like. One of those Joy-Con is better than the other one though, oh no.

I hate that snaking, not snake pass, yeah. Remember the old DS version? That was the problem with the DS version when you're playing that online got ruined, yeah. Don't cheat everybody, but again, I'm sure the best friend Community we build, we'll be fine. Moving on, all right. Sorry, May 5th, Prey... oh **** yes, May 5th.

And then when I sat down with uh Nick and did his let's play of it and he it was from the beginning it was like all right cool have you seen it from the beginning?

You're like, \"Oh, this is rad,\" and then there's this huge turn, and you're like, \"Oh, wow\" - and it's one of those things where the whole game goes 90 degrees, and you're like, \"Whoa, this is so cool.\" All right, cool. And then I got to finally play it at PAX East, and playing that was like... Is it just a one-hit wonder? What did they do there? And they're like, \"No, here's the powers,\" and you get to turn yourself into a fire extinguisher and chase after the bad guy stealthily, and then kill him from behind.

Whereas now it is like Mortal Kombat: Injustice, Mortal Kombat - yeah, it's alternating in this sort of biannual way, which, like, for instance, like I said as you, I'm well actually opposite of you; I'm not a huge comic book fan, but I played Injustice in that very similar way where I wanted to play through.

Right, I mean maybe they have a benefit in the fact that you know Street Fighter was such a lemon when it got launched, but they seem to have papered over some of those cracks now and people are back into playing online leagues and the competitive stuff.

It didn't get me, but every time something like this happens, it's weird \u2013 a lot of people are playing it. There have been a couple of MMOs this generation that went from total disasters to doing really well. I mean, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn basically reset that game completely and turned it into something new \u2013 a gamble that actually worked.

So, like I don't know... It's a you make expansions for games that are successful like if you have an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) that's working you keep making content for it. I think the fact that there's more stuff coming after this shows that you know there's an audience there for sure. Definitely they should have had a Morrowind expansion pack for Skyrim though because apparently that landmass was in the game - Sons of Skyrim, God damn it! Pete Hines, you son of a... Get on it!
