Michael Shannon is the front-runner to play Cable in Deadpool 2, while no deal is yet in place. Shannon has been the top choice for about a week. Fox, the studio handling the film, had no comment on the news. An official release date for Ryan Reynolds' sequel has not been announced. John Wick co-director David Leitch is that right? I think so. Uh, came on board to direct Deadpool 2 last fall after Tim Miller dropped out due to creative differences with Reynolds.
