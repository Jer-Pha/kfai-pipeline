Nick, I uh distinctly remember that uh because it was the first day I was supposed to start interning on Paramount Pictures lot and so I didn't... this was before obviously like cell phones were really really prevalent like I didn't have the person's like my boss's number on her like her cell phone number and I didn't really know how to get in touch with them and I was like I have to go like I'm living in Orange County at the time and this is my what I'm thinking in my brain is like this could be the start of my career if I if I show up for these people but then I'm watching this horrible thing unfold on the news and I'm like knowing in the front of my mind there's no everything's closed like today is this is not a normal day this is.",

And he stepped out, and half-closed the door behind him, and was talking to other people. What I thought I heard him say was...or somebody in the hallway say, \"The second tower just collapsed.\" When in reality they're saying the South Tower just collapsed. Uh, or the second tower just collapsed. And so I heard that, and our dorm was on the first floor, and you could see the balconies from the window in the dorm room.

So it's like, you know, I don't know that you know if we have you know the fact of the matter is something like that's probably going to happen to us again um and it could be way worse and it could be way more tragic like you know a dirty bomb or something like that which and I'm actually you know shocked that nothing's happened since then, like and it's to the credit of the FBI and the CIA and all that kind of stuff but at the same time I'm like it's it is a little strange to me that like nothing has",

The people who coordinated that attack on 9/11 or really smart people. I hate when they're dismissed as being like these barbaric backwoods Afghans. Well, they're actually mostly Saudis and stuff, but like these people from a very archaic part of the world, whatever. Like these guys outsmarted everyone in the American apparatus so I'm not so sure how stupid they are you know.
