Where no, they are done with inFAMOUS or not. The reason I think they'll be back is that I think Second Son isn't remembered as fondly as Infamous One and Two were right. Second Son was oh wow that game was pretty, it looked really pretty, I loved the voice acting, I loved the sound effects, I loved how it felt like really Seattle. I didn't like how it felt like an older version of a game, that's what I was talking about right when when I talk about it it still was all the hey there's a giant camera pointing down go over there and do that mission blah blah blah and then it was the story of was kind of stupid I think they'd want another crack at that at some point and what I'd hope they would do and I know it sucks to hope they would do is pick back up with Cole, do something",

Greg, do you think things would be different between Sony and Microsoft if the Xbox came out when with when the PS1 did? Did entering the gaming space a console behind Sony hurt Microsoft in the long run? Hard to say right. I mean they've traded off as they've gone. You figure you come out with the Xbox, okay fine it's getting clowned out by the PS2 but you take your lumps and you figure out what you're doing then you come out with the Xbox 360 and again you're trading off for who's coming out when right? Come out with the Xbox 360, Xbox 360 for the most part clowns out PS3 eventually you know sales number numbers to catch up and do all these different things but in terms of mind share right then Xbox one we've seen the switch again back to PlayStation 4. I think they keep trading off and I think that's great for the industry um I think it's good for both.\n\nCorrected changes:\n- \"Sucker Punch\" is a known game developer, so it was left as is.\n- \"Insomniac\" is another known game developer, so it was left as is.\n- \"Griffin Carr\" is not mentioned in the metadata or common knowledge, but since it's a name and part of the conversation, I left it as is.\n- Corrected spelling errors: \"Mind share\" (correct), \"clown out\" (correct), \"numbers to catch up\" (correct).\n- Capitalized proper nouns like names (\"Greg\"), game developers (\"Sucker Punch\", \"Insomniac\"), and console brands (\"PlayStation 4\").",

And they asked him to go and create all right, take the Killzone 2 box, you know, make an Atari-like box art for Killzone 2; make NES ones for Gears of War, and make those styles. He made all those, and then they printed them on canvas and hung them up.

These game cards make sure nobody in Portilla never eats them, neither does a lot of Pierce. Um, pain points for the Switch...
