So, I was thinking about this, Greg. When it comes to Nintendo Championship, we got to be a little less frivolous with it. It needs to still mean something. No, it's like the hardcore championship. That's what I said. It's awesome. Here's the thing. I like that anytime anything can happen. What I'm saying is I support that. I support when I say less for grabs.

Here's where it gets here's where the idea Kevin here's where the idea got a lot better. I'm walking till this morning, hood up, reflecting on everything that's happened the last 24 hours, and I had a good chuckle thinking about beating these crap kids to death. You know what I mean? And then I thought, here's, oh, why didn't I think of this earlier? So, we're going to do a little acting here.

After today's Nintendo Switch day one update, SD card support and online features have both become enabled on the new console, but game saves can only be stored on that console's 32 GB internal storage with no apparent option to transfer them. In January, Nintendo told Kotaku that all saves would be stored internally, but made no mention of if or how they would be transferred. In other respects, the console appears to have no big problem in managing storage between two devices.

You cannot add a friend by searching for the username or another similar method. Nintendo introduced friend codes as a way of protecting users, particularly children, from unsolicited friend requests.
