The fact that alright there's the main quest, I know what to do, I have it in my quest log, but you know the game is such a great job of in the beginning or I go to the tower and then look and mark things on your map, and that's the game. And then when I find that you can trade you know the Shrine currency in to make yourself stronger, it's like well that's all I want to do. And not to mention the fact that yeah the puzzles are so good, and that's what got me so far off the beaten path, you were on, and and so here's here's the thing about Zelda that I don't think it's being talked about enough, and again I haven't read people's final reviews so that might be why we didn't get a preview, yeah we're seeing you but the game is open and you can go anywhere",

There's a stamina system, which means you could swim for as long as you're allowed to; you can climb for as long as you're allowed to. We know all that stuff, yeah. But the house physics base this game is on, and how incredible decisions are, and how right off the bat they give you all these different powers and abilities using physics - it instantly makes you think, \"I can conquer any puzzle in this game right now.\" It's not like I know I need to wait to get the hook shot; it's like, no, you have what you need. Yeah, and it's all of a sudden you are the thing holding yourself back or getting into where you need to go - that's what I'm talking about, like what I said: this is a Zelda game, and I caught myself off guard by the fact that we all got so hung up talking about its open world, this and there's some.",

It's like it keeps you on your toes cuz you never know exactly what's going to happen. But there's been two fights already in different scenarios where I'm fighting and getting my ass kicked, it's like one hit kills and I'm just like \"like six hearts done yeah like holy crap\" and game over starts again but in the melee where it starts me am I okay the game's telling me I can do this yep you know and I did it again fails did it again fail.

And then eventually I won, and I'm like, oh, I could, yeah, like I had everything I needed; I didn't just need to figure out the pattern and how to actually go about doing this. And it reminded me instantly, and I've been saying this to a couple people that haven't asked me, but if I were to describe this game in a nutshell, it's like Legend of Zelda 1 on the NES and Ocarina of Time had a baby. Mmm, like it is as open and the boss fights are as challenging as L-12, but it does have like the story and the kind of just carrot world build in a world of Ocarina, and it's it's crazy because I haven't played a game",

But seeing it on the big screen, I was just like, \"this game is awesome,\" and the resolution is better obviously on the TV, so you do notice a lot of little things.

Did you beat Twyla Princess? I did. I don't remember well. There's there's a there's a whole bunch in where you're like spider-man-ing it up okay going around going through things which first off that's awesome, double hook shot like that.
