I would change my name if it just sounded better at this point Tim Gettys, I'm like I'm kind of sold on it for the longest time I wasn't sold on it, I was like this isn't a name like my friend Ryan Fry is, I was like that's a cool ass name and I was like you're going to go somewhere. Oh, and then he went somewhere when you inevitably marry G are you going to take her name? No Tim Gettys is some name, Tim Harris is some name, Tim Gettys SL Dash or hyphen Harris, uh no that's just convoluted why would I put a dash in my name when I don't need to.

So um so I think it's just people are kind of happy that Nintendo made a really great open world game, um and I like the lineage back to the original Zelda as well because I really love that game. So yeah not too many thoughts on it but uh that's that's my impression so far, I'm anxious to go back and very intrigued by the game, but um playing those two games back to back, I'm obviously going to compare them.

Horizon had a great story, and Horizon's action is way tighter and a lot more fun, uh, but Zelda's puzzles and uh shrines and dungeons and physics-based stuff is on another level; it's so amazing, and I think that they both complement each other very nicely. And I mean this goes back to what we talked about in the review, the Reacts review, whatever review in progress we were talking about, is the fact that I still was hesitant getting going into Zelda right after Horizon, the fact well I just had this awesome open-world game to jump into another one; what's it going to be like?

And like so what you're talking about where I'm ignoring the story in the main quest like I'm running into characters obviously I'm talking to different people I'm doing little quests here and there but I've been off the main quest for a while just trying to go through and get everything or seeing a shrine and letting that lead me where it leads me, and that's going to",

I agree with you usually I it'll start going off when I'm clearly moving towards them I'm like all right guys I got this.

Uh, but a big issue I have with the game is cooking's not fun. And I do wish that they took a cue from a lot of modern RPGs where there is the kind of like Fast Forward or just the option to say, 'Here's my ingredients, give me the best option.' But like some automated thing, like Final Fantasy XV did a great job of... yeah, there are all these recipes and you can cook and do all this stuff. But you don't have to. You couldn't just do the thing it's going to be like based on what you have, you should probably do this.
