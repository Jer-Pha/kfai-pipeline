Just like Jeezy Heat did after the Switch announcement, I noticed Bomberman is going to be a launch title. I love the series and haven't played one in over 15 years; however, Konami is attached to the game. What do you normally do in these types of situations where your love for the game is conflicting with your decision to support a company that appears to have done unethical stuff? I mean, put your money where your mouth is if you want. I mean, Bomberman R is not going to be this; this is not going to light the world on fire anyway, so I'm not sure you're going to have much of an effect on it. But um, this is what I've told - I said over and over again: if this is a good time for you",

I wish this was one of those moments where it was like...I mean, there's a lot of horribly awkward E3 moments, but I'll never forget that Nintendo E3 press conference when they let everyone play the 3DS and all these women with them attached came out. You're like \"What the...\" And they just went into the crowd, and people were playing, going...I remember that was an E3 I was there with Alfredo, so fill in the gaps and the stories there, but there were some, and they were fantastic.

Tyler for hi since I was born in 2000 and the first console I outright owned was a Wii. Yes, I'm young. I was wondering if back in 1997 when people saw Final Fantasy VII for the first time did they think those graphics were quote unquote good or did they still think they looked like... which they are. People thought that that game was beautiful. Um's were the big deal there but even the in-game stuff was first of all, not all it looks like... the a lot of the pre-rendered backgrounds and the drawn backgrounds are actually still beautiful I",

I actually played Final Fantasy VII not too long ago. Um, now when you're talking about character models and stuff like that, I mean they look awful. But even then, I mean they were impressive because we had never seen anything like that. But I've often said that the N64 and PS1 era is really the one era that just in no way shape or form holds up graphically, unless you're talking about sprite-based stuff and stuff like that, which still look great. Final Fantasy Tactics for instance still looks **** phenomenal. Obviously, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night looks awesome still. But jumping into 3D was such a learning curve and people did not know what they were doing; it was absolutely jarring.

And it's you can't really think of a way to have a camera with the pre-rendered backgrounds because it's like a static image. But yeah, I mean Ani Mash looked incredible back in the day and Devil May Cry - the tone and atmosphere of that game is entirely owed to its pre-rendered backgrounds because you can have the coolest enemy designs possible running around, but if it was just the polygons, you can imagine that being it would not have had the same effect. So yeah, it's it's interesting. I think that the only genre where that kind of stuff probably actually would work and it probably still exists in some ways maybe the adventure game uh genre especially with static screens uh obviously um but any any game that requires locomotion around an environment it's just it's just very antiquated it's it's the same reason why you just won't",

I'm not sure actually receiving your way could probably get through it but it's like that shit's hard. But I mean there is something about that challenge and knowing that it's hard that I wouldn't review that game poorly for being hard. I would you know part of the equation exactly, that's part of it and that that is the fun and that is the thing that that would grab me and that does make me want to play it even though I'm not good at it. If it was easier then it would be like all right this is just a hack and slash, I what's the point you know? Like the point is the hardness without the hardness there is no game there you go final question of the day Colin this is a a you question this is from Mughal the sly he says what are the chances of Konami getting a remaster maybe bundled in as a pre-order bonus for The Two As",
