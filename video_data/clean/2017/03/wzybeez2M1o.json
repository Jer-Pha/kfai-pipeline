Anyway, long story short is you would have **loved** this. What they do is they have a host of really good obviously improv uh actors come in and they pit two people against each other. So, two fictional characters against each other and you have to come out as that character and defend that character and blast the other one. And so, the show that I saw the first two were um it was Ripley versus Nurse Ratched. So, Ripley from Aliens versus Nurse Ratched. I was like that's pretty good. This is pretty funny.

I don't I I just don't know of any off the top of my head, but man, when you see people who are like this is what they want to do, this is what they put and these guys are like you can tell they're putting the time in.
