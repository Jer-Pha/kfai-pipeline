I need a microphone. I've never done a podcast. Uh, Lolita Bevenzi. Well, cuz she's she's Aaron's dog. But no, just Lola. Little Low. Little Low. Loli.

No. I I uh my my best I don't want to use his name, I guess, but one of my one of my best one of my best friends growing up, Eric, his mom, I was always confused because his mom was Mrs. Klene, but that was not his last name.

Went in there, I was like, \"Ah, I can dye it all one color. That's convoluted. I don't like that as much. I won't spend the rupees on it. Bounce out.

I got my Switch from Amazon and kind of messed that up and uh so I got it on Saturday. I messed around with it just a little bit on Saturday. I had Platinum Games' Horizon and then I've been playing Ghost Recon Wildlands. So, um, you know, I haven't played it too much. My honest impression of it after just a couple of hours is that I'm still in that opening area. I'm kind of just getting lost. Um, is, uh, you know, I think it's really pretty.

Um, but I'm still so invested in the game still so early that I don't really have a full fair impression of the game. But that's that's kind of the reason why I haven't played it more is I'm like I just got off of this amazing gameplay experience with Horizon Zero Dawn. Um, that seemed very 21st century and very new and very fresh and very fast and arcadey and rewarding. And then I was playing this game and I'm like it's a little slower, it's a little more uh heady and uh that's all great, but on a gameplay level I was just like nothing about it was pulling me in.

I tweeted out that it was nice to see uh to see Nintendo learn something from Western development and kind of do their own thing with it. And it's a very, you know, that's the thing where I'm I I feel like they're getting the Nintendo bump with this game. And I I don't know that, you know, I don't know, maybe in terms of this revolutionary game, but it see what I've been reading very a lot about it and reading people's impressions and the things that people like and it seems like they're doing things that have been done in open world games for many years.

I'm very intrigued by the game, but um, playing those two games back to back, I'm obviously going to compare them and I think a lot of people I think a lot of people are. No, we did it in our reacts when we when we when we had played a bunch of it and jumped in there. I think the one thing and I commented in the review for Horizon on for the Horizon review that I thought they did so well was discovery and exploration.

Whereas I I was and I was trying to think about this last night because I we've had a conversation obviously about this where that's how you felt about it. And for me it is the fact that I think in Horizon Zero Dawn there's different machine types you'll find. There's obviously a couple big twists to it. I feel like this is better with The Legend of Zelda better with the smaller surprises of going over there and then who the **** is this enemy type? Oh my god, I'm clearing all these guys.

I thought the save thing was giving you a time clock, but it was actually just what time it was. Time it was. Yeah. Sucks. Super. So, I'm I'm well into the game, but like just last night, you know, which is off the beaten path. Like I told you when I ran into that with the blue flame and you're like, \"Oh my god, that's a story quest that I just got to, but I'm shortcutting to it because I'm just wandering around finding stuff, completing that, getting new things on the Hyrule Compendium, completing the Shikai",

So, I mean, you've played uh I I think I've played a a bit more than you, but we've played both a lot of it. And I am so much farther than you are in terms of uh like the main actual quests are concerned. And it's just crazy cuz like you are farther than me in other ways.

I'm sure it'll be a story thing, but I'm hoping I'm hoping I can just I'll run into somebody who gives me a quest who does this that leads me that way and I'll get it. But even last night, like playing through again and like, you know, I'm way off the beaten path or what the main quest with the, you know, the yellow things. I've ignored all those and I'm just off doing something. And another giant, you know, the these giant dudes and it's what we talked about in the review, right, of like me just getting my teeth",

And I appreciate playing it coming right off of Horizon Zero Dawn because Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the best games that I've played in the last like 5 years. And then so is The Legend of Zelda.

They just want to go in and not know anything about it. And it reminds me of Star Wars in that way of like episode 7 and even Rogue One. Like going into that, it was very just like, yo, do not even talk about this. And it's different than any other property where it's like no one wants to be spoiled, but you can kind of get away with a lot more stuff. People want to media blackout this and seeing the characters as they come. Like I saw the the trailer at the Nintendo presentations what really sold me on Breath of the Wild.

And I mean this goes back to what we talked about in the review, the Reacts review, whatever review in progress we were talking about is the fact that I still I was hesitant getting going into Zelda right after Horizon the fact I just had this awesome open world game to jump into another one what's it going to be like and the fact that they're not open world in the same way and where the objectives and what you're doing seem so drastically different and the gameplay is so different and The Legend of Zelda",

You you mentioned wasn't you you said earlier about the Galaxy comparison right there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for bringing that up.

There's a very clear lineage there. But then you turn to 3D. Mario 64, Zelda Ocarina of Time. I think what Galaxy did which was, all right, what does Mario like what's the fundamental thing about what makes Mario game? It's jumping. It's the physics of jumping and getting around.

I don't know that I'll play much more of it than past this weekend or whatever uh when I have my time is waning or whatever with it. Sure. So um but I agree with you. There's too many games and that's the thing is like when I played near I was looking forward to Nier: Automata I downloaded it very quickly and um I just you know I spent half an hour I was just like I just don't want to play this you know and I got this is the time it's not August or something or July it's like there's",

But I think that people that play it with other friends, and I've gotten a lot of feedback saying that it's not worth playing without people, but I also got that feedback with The Division, and I think The Division was fine by itself. So, um, so that's my very, you know, kind of early impressions of the game. Yeah, Kevin and I did six hours with Wildlands, uh, here. We were playing with subs, so every hour we switched in two different subs. Uh, and I'm I echo Colin to an extent. Like, I mean, that was my thing playing.

We're out there for this operation where there's no not excitement to it, but there's no pomp and circumstances to it where The Division Yeah, all right. We're fighting cleaners who are guys walking around flamethrowing everything and there's Joe Pharaoh over here screaming in his New York accent.

So, I'm not locked into the world. It wasn't your traditional I think what you normally think of with a multiplayer where you're going to play for like Division. I'll play for a little bit by myself and then okay, it opens up and now I can start getting people in there. We jumped in and we're going from the get-go and so it was just same over and over. There were cool parts and different missions. Like I like I really do like the idea of all right this you know is the kingpin of this area. We don't know anything about him or her.

Some of those are some of those missions are cool. Like I think I might took down one of the kingpins in the area or whatever where we went down into basically like Kevin and I and the group went down into an area and like they were doing like they were torturing people down there. There's torsos and heads and every **** you know. Breach the door, go in, kill them before they can get the gatling. That was a really fun mission that stands out.

Think it's about expectations of what people think the console, the hardware is going to sell. I I think it's somewhat clear that Switch is not going to not going to sell these extraordinary numbers. So the the idea is like if your expectation is that you're going to have an ecosystem of ultimately 15 million units or whatever 20 million units and people can make money on that, well the proof's already in the pudding with VA.

So, it's not like, and it's not like Nintendo doesn't haven't been playing in the space for a long time.

Oh yeah. I've heard you talking about the game that is Advanced Wars, but I didn't know what it was. Wargroove. There's local and online multiplayer turn-based strategy. Uh, it's coming to the Switch later this year. Supports one to four players. So far, it's also coming to PC, Switch, and Xbox One. The directors being kind of um Chris Keighley about PS4. It sounds like there's some backend deals that are in question, but they want it to be there. Uh, it's it literally is the spiritual successor to Advanced Wars. And it's it's cool. It's interesting that because it kind of it mixes Advanced Wars with the aesthetic of Fire Emblem. Like it is a bit more fantasyesque than I feel like they they should be going just based on the trailer. Uh but it looks it looks really cool and Advanc is **** the dopeness. So what do you take away from all this? I'm this is awesome. Yeah. And then there's Stardew Valley. Uh first to get multiplayer. All right. Joey Noelle, we get it. You're obsessed with No.",

It's a very clickbaity question at a glance, but let me explain. Disclaimer, these are just my observations. I've never owned a Nintendo console and I've never played a Zelda game. Nothing personal, just haven't gotten around to it. Maybe someday. Breath of the Wild is currently sitting at a 98 on Metacritic with virtually every major outlet giving it a perfect or near-perfect score. By all accounts, this game is great. I'm not trying to dispute that. But I also know that I've heard many of many a handful of people in the industry praise Skyward Sword or Twilight Princess.

Do big Nintendo franchises have a tendency to draw out higher scores from reviewers based on virtually every game's quote journalist having some kind of childhood nostalgia for Nintendo? Again, I'm not saying Skyward Sword or Breath of the Wild is anything other than great, but looking from the sidelines, it certainly seems like Nintendo gets reviewed in a vacuum and praised for features that have been a staple in the industry for five plus years sometimes. No, it's a great I mean, it's a great point and a great question because that was the big thing, right? When these scores start rolling in and it's getting 10, it's getting this stuff.

For myself, the idea of buying a physical game to play while also having the option to have a digital code in case something happened to the disc I think may help keep physical copies around longer.

From my understanding, from things you guys have said, it sounds like that there's not just an a copy and paste button where people can make codes and there is some weird ramification to getting a limited number of codes and all these different things. And I think the one here is and I'm granted I'm speaking without understanding how the Blu-ray, Ultra HD, all that crap, those combo packs do it and even how comics really do it as well because comics have a similar thing. Some comics like I think the problem here you run into is the resellers market where it's like, all right, he's he wants it in case something happens to the disc. Okay.

But we're every day tumbling and tumbling and tumbling towards not having that and not and have, you know, 5G Wi-Fi be everywhere and just beaming it to you. That was the most exciting thing I ever had when like revelation talking to our friend who works at Apple and not at all on the tech side, but being like he's like the phones aren't going to matter. 4G and LTE, none of that crap is going to matter. Eventually, we're getting to the point where it's just going to be Wi-Fi everywhere. You're going to it's going to be Wi-Fi whatever in the in like that. I'm like, holy **** if that to do away with cables and to just be able to do it that way and have awesome systems that work that way. Great.

Like inevitably you're going to get to people whether it's like you buy you know you buy your Switch came on day one and Zelda didn't. So, **** you wanted that hard copy but you want to play Zelda now so you download it and you go that was easy and like that's it. It starts little things, right? That starts the more and more great games are smaller games that are only coming out digitally. Like granted, limited runs that doing their thing, but you're getting it that way where it's like, okay, like how is that going to actually work? I think a big problem going into it too is the difference between games and movies is games generally cost more to buy individually. And then how many times have I seen people give away their digital code of movies because they have the the disc and they're not going to use the digital one?",

And then how many times have I seen people give away their digital code of movies because they have the disc and they're not going to use the digital one? That could definitely create a piracy issue uh when the codes are just being given away because you're essentially getting two for one. So, they would need to figure out a real solution for that which gets hard. I mean, obviously PC games have been doing it for years, but there's a lot of piracy on PC games as well. Yeah. I I I mean, I think it's different just in the sense that games are more expensive typically and the Blu-ray market is pretty much dead compared to the gaming market. So, I think that that's them saying like, \"Oh, just buy and you can get a digital.\" But on the other end, I mean, retail sales are are lowering, but uh if a game sells 10 million, AAA game says, you know, Horizon's slated to sell sell 8 million copies, I'm sure 6 million plus are retail.

There's no need for them to draw you in. I think that the codes are necessarily put in there to stave the complete death of physical media in movies, which I think is right around the corner, frankly. So, I think it's just a different kind of scenario. Both of them are dying or both of them have a death sentence, and uh I think that the Blu-ray is just closer. So that's a way for them to keep everyone involved because streaming is so prominent and prolific. Now 16 bits of awesome says, \"Do you think the Nintendo Switch will have a half-generation upgrade much like the PS4 Pro and the Xbox One S or even the DS to the DSi? Given the nature of the console, what would a half-upgrade even look like?\" Definitely. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, my knee-jerk reaction would have been no, just based on the fact",

I mean, on the handheld side, which again, but this is their console. Don't forget, but it's also their handheld. So, I I I mean, they've done it forever with with DS, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy, which then went to Game Boy Color after 10 years. So, yeah, we'll definitely see one what it looks like. I mean, Nintendo's always done weird **** with the with their handhelds, uh, limiting the what can be done on each system. So, like when we got the DS, Yeah, there's a DSI DS Lite. I think that's what the third one was called. It might have been the other order. Like there were certain games only playable on the newer versions and the Game Boy Color obviously",

So I definitely think that they will. Um what it looks like I hope it has bigger buttons. Um even these buttons man I don't know. I can see them doing one with the 1080 screen. Uh, and that that type of stuff. Thinner. It'll be thinner for sure. Everything's thinner. Yeah, thin's thin's good. Uh, also, it still needs to be compatible with the Joy-Cons, so it can't be too much thinner. I mean, I I would say a hard no. That just doesn't seem like something Nintendo would do.

Um, I also don't think the Switch is going to sell well enough to demand that either. So, I think that that would be a mistake for them to to do that. Uh there's um what the **** is the company called? Super Data or whatever. The guys that are always turning out uh information or or projections have only 5 million switches for the first year, which is bad. So, I I just don't think that um there's going to be demand for an upgrade because I think that if you're getting involved in the Switch, you know that it's not going to have power.

I mean, I don't even necessarily think it'll more power. Ah, I don't necessarily think it'll add more power. I just think that just the resolution of the screen so it can just match what it outputs to on TVs. Who the **** cares? Uh I mean, but it's just it's just another who cares about the XL compared to the 3DS. Like, it's those little things. 3DS was ugly. XL was beautiful. I mean, it wasn't.

But I I definitely think they're going to and I think that, you know, Nintendo's been historically they've always had special edition consoles and a lot of their fan base does buy multiple iterations of the console they already own. Uh, like I've seen people with like five or six 3DS's just because they wanted the Fire Emblem one and the Pok\u00e9mon one and Zelda one and all that **** Uh, I think that with the JoyCons, they have a unique situation to do that type of stuff uh for cheaper.
