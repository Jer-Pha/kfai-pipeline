Honestly, I want to give a shout out to that showcase. Yes, so first off, they're calling them showcases, not directs. I'm interested to see if they're getting rid of direct overall as a brand. Yeah. Or and if they are just kind of focusing on presentation or showcase and like one-off stuff. Um, I'm so happy cuz this was what I wanted the presentation to be in terms of it's just a dude dropping trailers, making announcements, hella games. Yep, they're coming. Here's a whole roll out of these are game 60 plus games coming out in 2017. And this dude Damon Baker, the head of partner management, licensing at Nintendo, seems to be a really good dude. Seems to give a **** Reminds me a lot of the Geoff Keighley type. He needs hockey jerseys, dude. He does. He does. Uh, but I I like how out there he is and how many interviews he's",

And it seems like he really does care about being a face for this, but not so much as like a um a popularity thing, but more of like a no, it's important to know that Nintendo cares about this stuff and is going to address them correctly. I loved it. I thought that they showed so many games that I'm interested in actually playing. Uh what I wanted to do was read a quote from him from an interview he had that kind of answers a lot of questions and then go through the 17 games that they they showed at the showcase and kind of talk about where they've been before and what they're doing differently on Switch.

He says what we got here is we've identified a bunch of those developers that we think taps into what resonates really well with the Nintendo audience in particular and showcasing why that content fits so well on Nintendo Switch specifically. The way we're looking at Switch is this is a complimentary platform. If it's on Steam, then there's no reason why it shouldn't be on the Nintendo Switch as well. If you want to take that experience on the go, if you want to have a built-in multiplayer experience, this is the system to do it. It's got those points of differentiation, but we're not trying to go head-to-head against any of the other platforms. We just think that if the content makes sense to be on our platform, then it should be on our platform. We haven't opened the floodgates yet.

We're not saying no to content that only uses the touchscreen or doesn't use the Joy-Con in a unique way. But at the same time, we're trying to encourage those developers to have a conversation with them and say, \"Look, fans are probably expecting these types of fun features and functionality in the game. So maybe they should consider taking a look into what it would take to implement that technology into the game if it makes sense for that type of experience.\" In another interview, he talked about how there's going to be weekly releases on the eShop, and we were trying to figure out if there's when there's an actual like every Tuesday or whatever. We don't know that, but um someone if you do know, let tweet at me, let me know. But that's exciting to me.",

So, before we even get into games, what's the gut check on that? Awesome. I I've been talking to people about it. I went to the Nindies event and actually, yeah, Kevin, how easy is if I turned over my Nindies footage to you? You want to play it on the little thing for the three games I thought were awesome? Is that possible? Yep. All right, cool. It's on my desk. It's the, you know, the hard drive. We capture everything on. Yeah. Right. Because it's the hard drive off of the thing. You know what I mean?

Nindies, not a fan of saying it, Colin. Um, it's dumb. Going down there, uh, it was all happening. So, I was watching on Twitter, the announcements or stuff, and it was like, oh, oh, Overcooked, great. And then it was like, it's all happening. Stuff. I'm like, \"Fuck, like what's going on really?\" And to get there and go into the event and see all these different games there running and walk around be like, \"Man, that looks awesome.

The Vita gets lauded, right? Because people are still supporting it. Indies, you know what? Your Japanese third parties stuff like that or whatever. However, they can't do what Sony did to crush the VA, which is pull first-party support. This is the Nintendo console. So, okay, you're getting your Nintendo games on it for the next 5, 6 years, whatever it's going to be. And now, on top of that, if they keep dedicated to this, you're going to have all this indie blood there that keeps it going and keeps people playing and keeps our types involved. Obviously, not mainstream Joe gamers going to necessarily jump in to play Timbleweed or whatever it is, tumbleweed. But people who have the Switch, want to",

Cool. think it's about expectations of what people think the console the hardware is going to sell. I I think it's somewhat clear the Switch is not going to not going to sell these extraordinary numbers. So the the idea is like if your expectation is that you're going to have an ecosystem of ultimately 15 million units or whatever 20 million units and people can make money on that. Well, the proof's already in the pudding with VA and so um for the indies um and I do think that there's a compelling reason to own a Switch. I bought one for the two or three third party or two or three first party games a year that you might get that might be interesting to you.

I mean, this isn't necessarily new for Nintendo. Um, you know, WiiWare was actually a pretty interesting platform. Our friend Dan Adelman helped craft Wii Ware and um there was some interesting stuff going on there as well. So, it's not like and it's not like Nintendo doesn't have been playing in the space for a long time. But this is the kind they're going to because they don't have third-party support of really any consequence at all. They're going to need to rely on smaller developers to be able to make money. But um I've also heard that there's a lot of independent developers that are not happy with Nintendo at all. Um so and have that unfairly good authority. Yeah.

Like the um I don't I don't know. Yeah. You shouldn't go that deep into it, but I heard it was wonky contract. Yeah. I mean, well, I think it's pretty clear based on what he was saying in that that quote and the 17 games that they actually showed in the showcase versus the the rest of them they just put on the like the little logo screen where those 17 games, they all include some type of like here's the Switch news about it, like it has HD Rumble or it has new multiplayer or it's going to be exclusive to",

Yeah. I mean, from Nintendo's point of view, it makes sense what they're doing and and uh you know, the fact of the matter is there really isn't going to be a reason to own a Switch after Zelda until probably Mario and unless you're a Splatoon fan, but obviously um you know, Splatoon didn't push, you know, millions and millions of Wii U, so I don't expect it's going to do it to the Switch.

And some of them are old and some of them are new and some of them are concurrently going to be concurrently released which I think is great. I think Nintendo's doing the best it can do. I just think it also shows an inherent weakness because um instead of having your big AAA games like uh Sony or Microsoft would have their Halo or their Horizon Zero Dawn or whatever and then be surrounded by third party games of great consequence and then those will be surrounded by a great independent scene and then a bunch of trash as well. Um Nintendo just has their first-party games, no third-party support, and then the indies and I think that not having that buffer is really going to injure them and I think this is the best thing they can possibly do to prove that there'll be",

But, so this is I really feel like this isn't going to sell units, but for people that are buying, they're going to certainly feel like they have something to do. Um, and I do think that a lot of these games lend themselves to portability as well. So, I think that that's a positive thing. I think their third pillar is virtual console whenever it does eventually come whenever they finally announce announce it.

Uh you know obviously it's a schmup but they're calling it more of an actiony thing. and they stayed away from schmup. But it's like it it is like a pixel junk pixel shooter or whatever.

Uh if you can jump over Mr. Shifty, like Mr. Shifty was the Hotline Miami game, man. Like I walked over, I'm like, \"Oh, I had again.\" I hadn't seen the presentation, so I was like, \"Oh, it's Hotline Miami.\" And then I watched I'm like, \"Oh, it's Hotline Miami if you're Nightcrawler.\" And so like I, you know, there was a person in front of me who was playing it like Hotline Miami a bit and getting killed and they passed me the controller and it was just jump in there, punch the hell out of",

Kev, can you jump ahead to some more action rather than uh exposition here? Uh, but like you go in there and you, you know, you can take weapons with you and like some, there's one where you jump in, you get a Trident, you, you know, warp through the wall, you throw it through three guys at once and impale them all in the wall. Like that's for sure like this. I mean, I loved Hotline Miami. Hotline Miami, too. I thought the environments were too big. This is a nice spin on that exact thing, right? Cuz it was the same thing of I'd walk in, I'm like, \"All right, I'm going to shoot.\" Oh, oh, that was a glass window. They shot me through the window. I didn't realize that was a possibility.

At least it's coming on something. I'll have some what a controller or something to play.\" Yeah. So, it's uh top down action game.

This one I watched from afar before I went over to it and I was like, \"Gh, here comes this piece of shit.\" Because it looks like, you know, if you're not watching at home right now, ladies and gentlemen, it's a line across the screen. You're a seed in the middle of it and then the line goes up and down as you crawl this mountain. It looks like you're basically imagining if you were tilting the Switch or JoyCons back and forth to do it like as a motion game. Like no way.

You need to roll your seed, your character back and forth across it, but dodge and dodge enemies and dodge holes in the ground. And as you go, like you can change what kind of seed you are. So you can go, you know, as you go, you plant a you plant crystals. And for every four you do, you get a crystal. Maybe you get a crystal instantaneously. I forget now. And you can spend that to upgrade your things to do this to make more uh thorns to do these different things. You there are no checkpoints. You have a checkpoint seed.

I was like, \"Oh man, this is cool.\" Strikes me as for Greg Miller maybe a bit too frustrated. I can see getting really mad at this game really quickly. But again, it was like I like the idea that's cool. Do you know if this is exclusive or I forget not on there? Yeah, I don't I don't have any any notes on that. I can look it up for I I don't think I don't think they're out there. Oh, I'll find it. Okay, fine. Regular. You might be right. Um, cool. So, the other ones and these are all games that were playable there, right? Uh, well, I mean, I it depends on the 17. You go through and I'll tell you if I saw it there or not. Gotcha. Cool.
