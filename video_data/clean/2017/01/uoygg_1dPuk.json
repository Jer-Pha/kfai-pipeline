But the fact that the trailer was so good and then the movie was even better is what I think is most amazing about this, and the fact that usually it's the opposite. Oh man, great trans thing movement right? Well, that's Suicide Squad. Oh god no, I mean that you're right though when I first saw the trailer I was like \"I'm seeing this movie\" like you guys want me over, you did your job with this. This looks epic, this looks amazing and it was it paid off in every single way. And what I enjoyed the most about it was once it ended I had experienced so many different emotions throughout it and I feel like all of them were earned. And I liked that even at the end of it there was things that I'm like \"oh man, why didn't they do this\" or \"this could have happened differently\" or whatever but it's like it felt good, it didn't feel like \"oh man, they **** that up\" it felt yeah, they told the story.",

Like when they introduced John Legend's character it was intriguing, it's like alright this guy's obviously the bad guy you know but but why cuz they set him up like all he's a bad guy they almost immediately switch that on you and you're just like no he's a good guy just represents this dream that Ryan Gosling doesn't have and it adds this whole new element to it that it's no longer is it just love and dreams the idea of success is also thrown in there and success not being your dream it's like alright if you succeed at being successful what's that worth compared to love and um your dream right it's like nothing because he gets that he gets all this fame, it's all",

Of the fact like well this isn't necessarily gonna be cut and dried, isn't going to be this thing I you know I mean the fact of like when he gets the phone call and they're broken up and he's like she's not here, she's not here, and not anymore. And she's like auditioning so he's like what he drives all that way 'cause he's like I you know it wasn't the ham-fisted Richard Gere in a limo like I'm here to whisk you away make all your dreams come true. It's like I know how much this means to you, and even if we're not together and we're not gonna be together after this clearly like like I love you and this is important to you, I wanna make you ready no and you need to do this and I need to make you\"",

Richard Gere is totally a nice guy; it's like, well, Louis doesn't love you as much as she loves him. I think he was a doctor, like, save her a bunch of times even though we almost died every time he did anything. So I see this dude who's got a kid with her, and I'm like, \"Uh, sorry, she just doesn't love you like she loved him.\" That sucks. Yeah, he plays music; you just drive a nice car. My wife would be best friends with your wife, no. I was like, yeah, you know it's just too bad like that. You really want them to get together, and she's like, \"Well, if it were real life,\" yeah, I mean he would just wait until she got divorced. It means go back now; she knows LA.
