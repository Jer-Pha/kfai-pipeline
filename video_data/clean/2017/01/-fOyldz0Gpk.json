The most important game I want to tell you guys about that I played is actually an arcade game. Yeah, shocking. Where did you find an arcade game? What dumpster was this in? I played this um during the break and I forgot to tell you guys about it um when I got back but it is it's called Killer Queen. Now it's a really random obscure game and it's one of those hipster things where it's just like you hear about it and it's like word of mouth and it just kind of spreads. This is an old game came out in 2013, and uh Kotaku covered a long time ago by no means am I breaking news of this thing but this shit's fun as hell and we need to play it okay so Killer Queen is a real-time strategy platform video game developed by Josh DeBonis and Nikita McFarlane.

So Killer Queen is a real-time strategy platform video game developed by Josh DeBonis and Nikita Dragun. The world's only 10-player arcade strategy game has two teams, each led by a powerful Queen, face off to be the first to bring the giant snail God home, fill their hive with nectar, or execute a triple assassination on the enemy Queen. So here's the thing: in 2013, it first started at NYU; these guys made this game, and people started falling in love with it just locally there, and they're like, \"All right, let's get this into a couple more places.\" And now it's in 23 different locations in America. It's kind of a word-of-mouth thing where it's just like people are traveling to go play this game. Luckily, one of the locations is in San Francisco at this place called Brave (I was going to say I played this yeah did yeah I I I played I played at a risk tournament um at that bar and then went).",

We have teams, and people get super serious about it.\" I was like, \"We're going to go **** these **** up right?\" So we're feeling real confident, we go down there, we start playing, and we're just like, \"We're about to wreck shop in these dudes.\" We saw a group of people playing on the other machine; we're like, \"Oh, **** these guys,\" yeah, we got our asses kicked so badly. So here's what the game is: it's two arcade machines right, uh-huh, and uh, five players each, so it's five on five, and the idea is it's a dollar for all 10 players to play.",

And the idea is it's a dollar for all 10 players to play. So that's the best part about it is just like it's super cheap to get in, and you really do need five players in each team or else it's like super unbalanced and not fun at all. But where that adds the fun is that you just start grabbing random stuff around you, like, \"play with us,\" right? Because you just need to play one round, you get super into this thing. Losers have to pay for the next round, ah, so winners stay on the console all night, right? So we put down a dollar, got our asses kicked, we play another dollar, got our asses kicked, another $20 later, Jesus, we're still getting our asses kicked, and this other team has only paid $2 because we only won once, and they played the first time. Yeah, and it was just like addicting, is all that right? We had no idea what we were doing by the",
