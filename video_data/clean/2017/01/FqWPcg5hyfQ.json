I'm excited about this when are they bringing back NCAA football? I feel like the NCAA has gotten better about it so far. We miss it, we all miss it. After the after, in a few years when the athletes are getting paid and they own their likenesses and stuff, I think that EA will get back into the game. Do you think? I really hope they do; an inevitable future is there. Oh, I like it. I don't like blue and orange though; that combo has never been nice. Can you just take... I mean, they gave you something isn't that better than nothing? Aren't you sick of seeing green fields everywhere?

That sounds very detailed. Yeah, yeah. And they got a couple classic Sega stuff arcade games in there to play and stuff. Uh, but it's the same thing of just like if you want to play a Yakuza game and just mainline that story, you can and go through it, and what again? What I think usually Yakuza games excel at is that it's still an interesting story. It is this, you know we're playing there as Kazuma again, you know this time before he actually goes anywhere and this whole family that he's in and with his clan and how he's going to move up to eventually become a big deal and then go off to an orphanage; spoiler alert for what happens in",

I was like, \"Woof, that's not an anime storyline you're allowed to do.\" But you jumped around between characters - this one set from Kaz's perspective, who I knew from my earlier Yakuza gameplay experiences. Rather than just still spice it up, it seems you can switch your fighting stance from Brawler, which is very anchored and you're giving out heavy slow blows, to a new stance where you can jump around, be super fast, dodge around, and kick the **** out of everybody, and use them differently to fight different bosses and do different things like that. And that's what Yakuza always does - it's interesting because it's like a Dynasty Warriors in a lot of ways mixed in with its really good story.

And going through that and playing that, I'm like, \"Oh, Gravity Rush. This is fun.\" I enjoy Gravity Rush, but it is the same thing - turn your world upside down. This is gravity. More of this is Gravity Rush. This is exactly what I expected as I was talking about on PS I love you XOXO. Haven't gotten to the new powers which make you lighter and make you heavier or stuff like that. Had played that at PSX, uh...

It's not like free roam, so it's not that. The developer, I believe, is he's from or he lives in San Francisco now, so I assume it's just like us where there'd be all these references but references to what the 49ers and their quest for ten and like how they're you know playing against the Japanese guys and how it's expanded that way.

I understand how this all works.\" There's it, you can see it down here. Are you playing it, Kev? It's kind of like... yeah, this is the one I play. This, yeah, it's kind of like a Super Smash Bros. map played like TowerFall would be played right, but strategy. So the strategy comes in: there are three different ways to win at any given moment. Okay, so at the bottom, there's a giant snail all right, and it moves really slowly across the bottom of the screen. If you get on the snail, you ride it, and if you get it across your goal, you automatically win that's one way. But that snail is slow as ****, and if people come down and kill you, they can get on it and start riding it. The other way... so it's classic tug of war. The other way: each team has one Queen.",

Microsoft came out with a statement after careful deliberation: Microsoft Studios has come to the decision to end production for Scalebound. We're working hard to deliver an amazing lineup of games to our fans this year, including Halo Wars 2, Crackdown 3, State of Decay 2, and Sea of Thieves, and other great experiences. What are your thoughts? Surprising... uh, you know I don't know.

Um, and in return, the studio makes that game for the publisher. And I've seen that relationship as Greg has work out many times with many different people. I'm very close with Insomniac; that was their entire relationship with Sony um, and later on with Microsoft with Sunset Overdrive. Because this is the third game that's had it plug pulled in what seems like a year and a half maybe, with Fable Legends um, and with uh Phantom Dust being the other two.

So I cracked myself there - they pull the plug on these well into development. Scalebound has been in development for three or four years, so they spent it's not inconceivable to assume that they spent $50 million more than that on the game, probably including exhibiting it, bringing people to these shows showing it off.

With the 30th Anniversary, obviously Rockman was released in '87. Um, these iOS and Android ports of the six um, the two trilogies basically from NES, are apparently awful.

I'd say is the closest thing in terms of being a quality um platformer but it's not really a platformer, it's you know it's also kind of a third person shooter in a lot of ways and it's it's not Mario. You know uh but I think the the reason is like Mario's Mario and Mario's at such a high level that you can't compete with that and even if you could compete from it from a quality perspective, you still don't have that same recognition and nobody's buying those type of games on that level so it's not even worth.",
