Do we agree or disagree? That was all great. Uh, it happened before though. We recorded this on Tuesday, which was before the whole executive order on immigration happened. So that's why we don't mention it. We didn't want you thinking we were ignoring it. See as how everyone's talking about it on Twitter and everything else.

Something like the wall for instance or a complete repeal of the Affordable Care Act - anything else like that's going to require Congress to do that, and so that's going to take time. But he can do more immediate things by signing these executive orders. I thought I'd go over the 10 things that he's declared and see what you guys think of them okay Greg's taking notes by the way; he's not drawing pictures of but holes I I'm yeah I'm gonna do a yay or nay thing for myself number one the first thing he signed uh the uh rollback of the Affordable Care Act Obamacare it says Mr Trump and these quotes are from PBS they're not mine quote Mr Trump has allowed all agency heads to waive requirements of the Affordable Care Act to the maximum extent",

Overall, he's going to the House, I'm sure, is going to get rid of ObamaCare completely. Didn't he say his plan for ObamaCare was basically like one of his spokesperson said: \"the plan is to let the states decide,\" still, which is pretty much a bomb. So what I think one of the major so if you go back to 2009-2010, one of the major things that wasn't in ObamaCare that people wanted that conservatives really wanted that I would have actually been on board with and actually supported was the idea that you can buy",

So a Californian right now under Obamacare can only buy California insurance. So if the insurance company doesn't do business in, for instance, or cannot do business in California, then you cannot buy that insurance. And there are some states that literally have one insurance company or two insurance companies doing business, so they can just charge you whatever they want. So the idea here that we proposed a long time ago, that Trump wants to do and I don't know if it's going to work or not, is the idea that um a person in Louisiana can buy their health insurance in Michigan. And then the insurance that they had, the policy's 100, I'm just using random numbers, the policy is $100 in Louisiana, it's $90 in Michigan. Now the Louisiana company realizes that it's",

This is a very complicated issue, and it was one of those things I was talking about with someone on Facebook where you know talking about universal healthcare, Medicare for all - I'm like I just want to reiterate there isn't a society in the world that gives itself American-style healthcare, I understand the quality of American healthcare is not the quality of some healthcare but",

So at the core of it, we know what the **** we're doing; it just hasn't dispersed well to the common man. Can't go to any of those things you just talked about, any of those pills. So there's it's one or the other. But with those things said, there isn't a society in the world that gives premium healthcare, which we do have in the United States, whether anyone wants to say that or not. We do uh the 270 or 280 million people that have insurance through their corporations and the companies they work for have premium healthcare, that there is no society of even 150 million people in the world",

But in China, which is a billion people, they don't have quality healthcare. When you have to scale to that size, it's really difficult and and and when everyone's like \"Well, Denmark has universal healthcare.\" I'm like, \"Denmark has the population of New York City,\" so we need to scale it in a way that makes sense, and it's going to be very hard. It's going to be very expensive. And one thing that Obama said again \u2013 I'm I'm going to cite that Bill Maher interview that was so fascinating \u2013 one of the things he talked about is and he said and he admitted was that like you can't just destroy 17% of the economy by saying we're just going to give it to the government.

What it says is that things that have not been approved but have been passed to be approved are now frozen, and I think that is perfectly reasonable. I think it's reasonable\u2014it's unfortunate and scary\u2014but it's reasonable. If I were a leader, I would want to be able to do that, you know.
