I love it when they do direct-based shows on single games because it allows them to get into all the stuff further for the real fans. Guess what? I'm a real fan of Fire Emblem. I'm super excited about this. Sometimes they do the Animal Crossing ones, and I'm like, \"Alright, I get that there's millions and millions of people out there who like Animal Crossing.\" I'm not one of those dudes. So here we are. Who knows what they're gonna announce? Are they gonna talk about the new Fire Emblem? Ooh, so they announced Fire Emblem Warriors on the Nintendo Switch. Probably, I'd assume so. Are we gonna see gameplay of it? I hope but I doubt it. Would it be a good sign if we did? Those games can't take too long to develop. Hopefully, we're looking at 2017. They're second off firing Boom on mobile. You can assume we're gonna get that. It's been",

Gaiden stands out from other games in the series thanks to its unique gameplay system which puts clever twists on strategy conventions and mixes in some exploration in towns and dungeons. As for Fire Emblem: Echoes, Shadows of Valentia, it reimagines Gaiden on a grittier skin; they're still not giving up I see that's produced protagonists Alm and Celica will join others locked in a tragic war dividing the continent of Valentia which the developers have recreated from the ground up.

Huh, all right. Bone everything that made Fire Emblem Gaiden unique is here; it's classic Fire Emblem gameplay with a twist. And I get that it's on three yes, Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia launched on the Nintendo 3DS family of systems May 19, 2017. Amiibo figures of Alm and Celica will march onto store shelves. We'll have more to announce in the future. Or they're definitely still showing the phone game on the distant horizon. Another full-scale war is mounting. That's right, dear son.

This game has a Gillian's (corrected to \"Gillian's\" from \"Gillians\") you can save on the number of views when she died in a fateful battle. I couldn't start yes, I knew the story most warriors never learned their limits and Lloyd is a shining example; the heroes are depicted in brand-new art, hand-drawn by a variety of illustrators, and their voices have been newly recorded. Yeah, there we go. Lin (corrected to \"Lloyd\" or possibly \"Leo\", but more likely \"Lloyd\") I've taken a real interest in you, and my favorite is captivated by my style and the grace, of course, you are.
