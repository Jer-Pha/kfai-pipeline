Why are you sitting on that side? Because we talked about it. That's where I sat now. You gave up the throne. We never talked about it. Alright, Kevin will you go to the archive for the last, the one that Colin and I were on at the table. Not yesterday when we were sick. Show begins the same way. Stop sipping your coffee. Why are you bothering me in every way you possibly can today? I don't understand. What have I done? I just wanna, I just wanna, I just want peace and quiet and tranquility in my life. Should we check out what's going on in the back room? The back room is the cityscape of San Francisco, Kev. I'm not gonna call him. Oh, sorry. What? Should we check out what's going on in the back room? Ah, you'll see it later. What is it? Go check it out. It's probably not that important. You're right",

Have you sat down in the cockpit and done something? I used it this morning. What'd you think? Fucking awesome. Did you VR it too? I don't know what that means. You used the VR? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, that's how I used it. So explain to people what you're doing back there. I was looking for that video for you. Gotcha. I guess I'll stop that. Okay. I have a VR, I wish I had a picture to show them. You should've done that probably, yeah. You're the one who let us down this train of conversation. You're the one who let us down.

You were working. You were working. So yeah, I think that watching Twitter meltdown has been not even funny, but just kind of sad. Here's my question about the Twitter meltdown. Is that I understand my feed is cultivated for video game people, our friends, best friends, stuff like that. That's why I follow. New sources for that.

And there are some Democrats that do like Trump, clearly because he won a bunch of people that voted for Obama twice. But no, I mean I only follow like 200 people and most, I follow like organizations and there are a few people like my good friend Dave Rubin and some other guys that have more conservative leanings, whatever, but I don't typically follow like individual people because I'm not really super interested in hearing the things that, you know, that, like I don't need to read, it's like why I don't watch Fox News or something like that or enjoy, I don't know, some of these conservative blogs or whatever because it's like I don't know, I know how I",

I like to see the other side so it's nice. It's just sad to me that this is going to be the resistance to a Trump presidency. And I think that it's sad and I think it's misguided. I think that, as I said yesterday and as I will write and the tenor of my piece today will basically be that like we need an honest, good, mind-driven, brain-driven resistance to this particular brand of conservatism and we are not getting it. And that makes me very sad because expectations are so low for Trump that he will exceed your expectations and because you've set them at the ground level. And as I said yesterday, you've got to just, you have to hit him, you know, if you really want to dismantle what he's doing then you have to set the bar high and running around calling Rex",

No, these are actually some, there's some cartoon characters on there, there's some very smart people on that cabinet as well. Let's keep things honest and grounded and then set expectations for these people to achieve things on behalf of all of us and if they don't then you have some ammunition to destroy them because clearly your ammunition didn't work.

The arguments that were made beforehand and during the election and in this run up to here didn't work and there's nobody cares about them so fine, let's move forward. In his speech today he said, you know, he's never ever going to let any of us down. It's like, okay, so now when he does let me down, keep track of that and go from there. Exactly, like go find what his policies were, his protectionist policies if you don't agree with them, his tax policy if you don't agree with that, his environmental policy, etc. and so on. Identify those things that bother you that you have expectations or things that you want to happen that he hasn't achieved and make sure he achieves them and then you can hit him on policy levels because clearly the personal stuff doesn't work and actually I really do believe Trump turns",

And so when I see that kind of stuff, that kind of rhetoric on Twitter, it's fun to do every once in a while but the hyperbole is only going to hurt you. It's not going to help you. Normal people in the country that don't do these things observe this particular brand of hyperbole, observe this particular brand of rhetoric. They're turned off by Trump but they're also turned off by the resistance and when that kind of stuff happens you keep the status quo, you don't change anything. So I just worry about people's ability to deal with this rationally in a way to get a win because I'm telling you right now, 2020 is anyone's game but what is the goal? You want to impeach Trump, okay so you get Mike Pence? And then you're going to impeach Mike Pence so you get Paul Ryan who could",

I just don't get it and I want people to try a different way because I think a different way will work better. And maybe I'm wrong but I just don't, clearly the evidence says conflict. I hold onto the hope that for everyone freaking out today and existing in hyperbole and doing all these different things, it's similar to how election night and, you know, there's 24 hours of the election, right, we'll say, today was a punch in the gut, today's a punch in the gut, you get up, you dust yourself off and we go back to trying to be Americans and figure this out and figure out what we're going to do.

So I will more eloquently explain how I feel and what I think the way forward is. Keeping in mind a very interesting thing, talking about the political loop instead of a line, the spectrum.

They're indistinguishable actually from each other. So if you believe in that kind of economic populism then maybe pull for that. And what I'm wondering is what is victory for the anti-Trump movement, right? Is it that he fails because then we're all fucked? Like I voted for Obama in 2008, but in 2012 I voted for Mitt Romney and I still wanted to win, when Obama won, I still wanted to do well because it's important that he does well. And I felt the same way I voted for Bush, but you know, and I actually like George W. Bush, but the opposition, the Kerry voters that voted, it's like but we should want him to do well.

How do you figure this out? So from like could there be a way that people could work together? Yeah. A portion of Bernie Sanders' economic message is again indistinguishable from Trump's, specifically in attacking NAFTA and manufacturing base buildings in the United States. And Sanders seems to be, although he hasn't really talked too deeply about it or didn't talk too deeply about it, seemed to be a protectionist. And so, you know, while the other half",

Because I've always been a protectionist. So it's could everyone find common ground in this thing? Could we work together in this way and affect positive change for people in that respect? Because it's over. You know what I mean? It's over. And whining in the streets isn't going to change anything. It's not going to change a goddamn thing.

And so I just feel like, you know, it's disappointing to me that the reaction is to attack his children or to attack the way he looks or whoever. It's like who cares? Like what is that? Is that relevant to what we have today? We also look at the positive things. Why did the market react positively to his election? And can we learn something from that? And can we garner something from that? And how do we, you know, we must have an honest and good and powerful liberal resistance.

They didn't expect to lose and what it did was expose the fact that this powerful federal facade in which there is very little Democratic power in the actual states.

I thought what you're talking about when you're talking about the echo chamber, when you're talking about people whining in the streets as you put it, I thought it was one of the most powerful things in Obama's farewell address was when he was talking about don't argue with people on the internet, talk to them in real life.

And people lose sight of that and that's how far we got off track during the election, which is one of my big points I kept bringing up on Game Over Greggy and his show and stuff. How fucked the conversation was. Yeah, my feeling will be the same. I've lost elections and I lost this election too. I didn't want Trump to win. I didn't want Clinton to win either because she sucks as well.

And what I'll be interested in, we were going to do it on GameOverGreggy's show as I said yesterday this week and we'll do it next week instead, is I really want to see specifically how everyone feels about specific policies. When you remove the man, the facade of the man, what do you agree with and what don't you agree with? And go from there. The beauty is that Democrats have a really great high rung bench for people to run. You have Castro, you have Warren, you have maybe a very elderly Sanders, you have Biden, you have...

The online infrastructure seems a little half-baked. That's why you're getting it as a demo to begin with and then charge it in the summer.

Remember when the PlayStation 3's Morpheus was shown Sony didn't even commit to the fact that they were even going to release it when they showed it. They wanted to gauge interest. And what I think is, what happened is that I don't think that they expected the Wii U to bomb as badly as it did. The Wii U was an abject failure for them, the worst-selling Nintendo console, mainstream console they've ever released.

And I think that with Switch particularly, I don't know that they anticipated having to launch it this quickly. And I don't know that they anticipated necessarily even launching this particular skewer, this particular type of machine. And they were listening I think to people wanting a hybrid and all these kinds of things. Kind of the obvious nature of the direction that they would go in.

But unfortunately these kinds of situations similar to Saturn with Sega put people in a position where you release a Dreamcast that has some good ideas in it. But is half baked and ends up dying. And I really do feel that. I was seeing some predictions. One prediction had a lifetime sales of Switch at 50 million which I think is absurd. And another had, Nintendo I think it was, but I could be mistaken, was saying something like between 6 and 8 million sold in its first year.

Let's jump over to some PlayStation news at GameSpot. Eddie! This is Uncharted: The Lost Legacy's tone, gameplay teased. This is Eddie boiling down a larger article from over at the official PlayStation Magazine UK. The Lost Legacy puts you in the shoes of the character Chloe who appeared in past games but not Uncharted 4. And hasn't really been fully explored. The sympathetic villain Nadine from Uncharted 4 is also in the game. But we don't know exactly how the two characters are connected. It's set in India, according to the creative director Sean Elsley. S-K-G? What do you probably want to pronounce that? S-K-G I would say? Sean Elsley I'd say.\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n* \"way more reasonable probably\" -> \"Way more reasonable, probably\"\n* Added missing capitalization for proper nouns like \"PlayStation\", \"GameSpot\", and \"Uncharted: The Lost Legacy\"\n* Corrected spelling of \"Elsley\" (from \"S-K-G\") to match the host's name\n* Capitalized \"PS4\" as it is a proper noun",

The setting works well for Uncharted. India's got really nice icon... iconography. Hidden temples and weird deities we can play off of. So it's a perfect setting for Uncharted: The Lost Legacy he said. Game director Kurt, friend of the show, is also quoted in the story teasing that in terms of gameplay you should expect something different than Uncharted 4. Quote, I would say we're going a little more wide this time. I don't want to give too much away. But it's something we're really excited about on the gameplay side.

Inside is already out. I don't think it's going to be anywhere else. And I also think, and I'm just speaking frankly I don't know they're a private company.

DJ Khaled gave us two tips in a row here. The first one says please try to have Kumail Nanjiani on there and his wife Emily V. Gordon on. They used to have a gaming podcast, The Indoor Kids, but they haven't hosted in forever because of their shows. Please bring them on. Here's the problem DJ Khaled. I know Kumail and I know Emily and we were negotiating years ago when we were still in the spare bedroom before we left IGN to have them on and Southwest canceled their flight. We're going to have an Indoor Kids Kinda Funny crossover podcast. Southwest canceled their flight when they were coming up for Sketchfest and that never happened and then Kumail got huge.

Any recommendations for games that can be completed in the weekend while we hide from the snow? I mean lots of games can be completed. Gravity Rush 2 is out now. That's fun. Try that. Yeah, you can complete it in the weekend. Song of the Deep, I like that weekend. Ratchet and Clank, that's a good cozy. I'm going to get cozy and have a throwback old school game thing.

I did that a lot when I was in the cold winter up there in Quebec. And final tip of the day and the week goes to Marco Kazama. Colin, thoughts on the Women's March? You seem against protest for the most part. Do you feel it is not beneficial? You seem to be the type that would be on the streets. I'm not against protesting. That's obviously your first amendment right. I know a lot of people that I went to college with, friends of mine, whatever, that are going to various marches in Washington and around the country. No, I'm not against it in principle. I just don't think that 9 out of 10 times they don't do anything. The last time there was a major massive protest that actually affected real change was 50 years ago. So it's, and that was for a powerful and important thing, civil rights. And so you have to be organized. You have to stay on the streets. You have to",

There are no Martin Luther King Jr. type people running around today that have that kind of air about them, that have that kind of respect about them, that have that kind of uplifting message for all people. So mostly, most of the time in the 21st century, protests evolve into violence. They evolve into looting. They evolve into stupid shit that counteracts what your goal is, which is why I think you have to be very careful. Look at Occupy Wall Street for instance. We were there. We saw it with our own two eyes in New York City that year. We were there for Comic Con. That helped nothing. That actually hurt the message. That actually made Obama's path to reelection more difficult. That gave conservatives fodder to attack people, to call them jobless, to",

But I can think of a million different protests that were out there that really affected no change at all. It makes you feel good. It's catharsis and I get it. Into the chat, Josh Graf says, Have they talked about Obsidian possibly teasing Fallout New Vegas in the past two days or did I just miss it at some point? No Josh, you haven't missed it.
