R3 games did exist a little bit before Adam came on, but when Adam came on he brought a really interesting sensibility to it, including one of my favorite things we did was uh skits, like bringing back skits and stuff which was like a very X-Play thing to do, and something that we probably would never have touched if it weren't for you. But we have all these weird old scripted like how many videos there still out there on YouTube for now um now and then, and to your point Greg, like everyone from R3 games has moved on to do something pretty cool.

Okay, I don't even understand how this aspect works. It really highlighted something that I always kind of expected but it made sense, you know. As press, they would only tell us a little bit of information ever so often. And part of that is when you're designing a game, you're also experimenting like you don't you know what you want in the end but you have to first implement it to see if it actually works. And the difference between on paper something might seem really really cool but then in the game it's like hold on, that really doesn't work or that you know.",

That's interesting. I've never thought about that perspective, and you're right to your point there. Um, there's a lot of cynicism obviously about what you know, say a developer is saying when they're made available to the press - obviously sometimes they're given talking points or also they may not be that comfortable sometimes just sort of talking to the press and so they get coached or they get ideas.

And also, when the child comes out, there's like a 60% chance people are going to be like, 'Your son sucks; he had a shitty kid.' No! I've actually used a similar analogy to explain why the existence of a game leak is so devastating to a team - imagine if someone else announced your pregnancy and your baby's name before you.

They really take this character, like, into their arms, and they play the game as this horrible monster, and it's like, it's the funniest thing in the world.

Like no, it reminds me a lot honestly of when I was working at IGN and it was the thing of like well you guys gave this game this score, I'm like or you did this, I'm like I didn't do that, I don't... well this opinion piece, I'm like I don't agree with that person. What do you were there's a million people working at that and that still I think is a fascinating problem. And you know we obviously dealt with this on G4, I mean there was g4tv.com which was a fundamentally independent entity from that of X-Play, and there you know so if someone says something over there does it reflect you know on X-Play, and then there's the entirety of G4. I begged and begged and begged um like game companies like if they wanted to get like use our score in an ad or pull a quote I'm like could you use the person's name alongside the outlet",

But don't think that necessarily means everyone is in lockstep coming to whatever that voice is. I mean, my god, there were knock-out drag-out fights at G4 over certain game reviews - oh yeah, you know? Because it wasn't necessarily reflective of the opinions of everybody else. I know that happened anytime there was a top 25 or a top 100 list, like \"**** off, I hate you, hate this, and I hate you.\" And why is it that the thing that gets the most clicks is easily like a recipe for just disaster and the loss of friendships?

And I'm just like, \"I woke up today and put on a bathrobe and made a YouTube video about having sex with Crash Bandicoot.\" Like, I didn't... I'm not the person you want; you got the wrong guy. Mon fell out... like wait a second, it's just so funny to me that like people expect an outlet to be one collective like voice.

And well, you know this, I wanted to get as far away from that as possible. I'm like, I'm just giving you my opinion; what you do with this opinion, you know? Like if I like the game and your copy of the game turns out to be buggy, don't come to me, because that's not what I want to talk about as little as possible.
