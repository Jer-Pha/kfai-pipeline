You can go to cy.com/gamescast topic and leave your topic, just like these beautiful people did. Joseo says, \"Hey, what games on PC should you be playing?\" Oh, Counter-Strike: Battlegrounds, Diablo III, Blackwake, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone too if you're into the card game. So I'm not, but I know a lot of people are. Yeah, I mean Rainbow Six Siege is what this play well, what's this game you in uh? And have been playing a lot lately, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. So give us that, it is the hotness right now. It's coming to consoles eventually, but right now it's in Early Access on PC, and it seems to be like all the range. I don't know anything about it, I mean it's essentially if you ever played H1Z1, the same premise where it's like imagine The Hunger Games, the game, right? Where you parachute down, you start looking for a gun frantically, right, you're starting to loot up and you're trying to",

Al, um, so like I said, it's if you played H1Z1, it's just like H1Z1. Is it like a sci-fi shooter? Is it like an AO modern third-person first-person uh both yeah crazy who yeah so you can like go into third person and like kind of use that third-person camera to like kind of see around you know the side of a tree and corner and stuff like that, and then you can go first person to you know ads and scope down and whatnot huh okay or you go over the shoulder they give you a variety of things it's it's a fun game it's it's a slower more tactical version of H1Z1 so what other differences are there cuz we had I guess Will Wright not the Will Smith a different Will Wright on the show a couple a couple weeks ago and he was pitching us on the game and I'm I'm",

The thing about this I know a lot of people have put a lot of time in H1Z1; it looks promising like way more promising than H1Z1 so far. H1Z1, yeah, H1Z1, like came out and did they did their thing, and it was riddled with issues. And then people were like, \"We we need this fixed. We need like region lock or ping lock, and we need less desync.\" And then they're like, \"We have crates for you guys.\" It's like, what the **** are you guys doing, man? Fix the game! Not to say that Battlegrounds doesn't have those similar issues, but every week there's a patch. Also, yeah, it's early access right; it's early access too, yeah. Not excuse, but fair enough.

Granted, you get this too in Battlegrounds, but it's on a smaller scale, and you just have more confidence in the development team when they say \"hey, these are the issues and these are what we're going to fix.\" Oh, by the way, we're having weekly updates like the game adding new things and trying to fix these issues, and you just have confidence that this is going to end up being a really good finished as polished product further down the line. Awesome, so besides playing on Battlegrounds, what other games have you been playing on the PC? Uh, I've been playing this game called Deceit, which is a **** hilarious game.
