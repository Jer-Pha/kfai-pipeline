So we'll wrap Red vs Blue Season 15 and then we'll have our 15th birthday about six months later. Man, pretty nuts. So Red vs Blue, you were totally involved for the first 10 seasons. Yes, I mean that was my show, I wrote and directed the show and everything. And it's like what we considered to be the founders now were essentially the cast members of the the show. And for a long time it was our only show. It was I mean we had some other stuff we tried to do, I did some miniseries and things like that. But for probably seven years it was really the only thing that we did which is crazy to think about now that you know even a show as big as Red vs Blue, uh, I would never bank everything on Red vs Blue for the next seven years, I wouldn't do that.

Right, Rooster Teeth presents Red vs. Blue, so I'm sure in the first say three to five years of doing it, like you knew it was a success but like where did you see Rooster Teeth going at that point at that point? Well, you know we, I was a startup CEO because I was also CEO of the company it started in a in a spare bedroom in my house and as a startup CEO, I was it's a different mentality where you know I was watching everything watching the bottom line very closely. Also had this kind of idea that this is entertainment and it's online which is a cross-section of two very volatile careers so I had a feeling this could go away at any moment you know and do you still feel that way",

You know, that Vlog I did that we were talking about in a previous segment... um... we were talking about just the different business models of Rooster Teeth. So when something like the ad apocalypse happens on YouTube, we know about it and we're aware of it, and I definitely feel bad for people who are very affected by it. But for us, it's like ads pre-roll ads can evaporate entirely and it doesn't take our business away; we have so many other aspects to our business. But yeah, I was just looking at growing things and keeping going. I probably... you know, five or six years in that's when YouTube was starting to get big, so I was looking at that and going \"that'll never be a thing,\" you know.

Um, you know, the first video we ever put on YouTube was the trailer for Season Six of Red vs. Blue. If that tells you anything, that's our first video on YouTube. So we were already six years in as a company at that point in time. So yeah, wow, that is insane. So so going from there then you got you have your Red vs. Blue and you're scared to go on YouTube not scared but you feel like it's not going to go anywhere I you know why I would have put my videos on somebody else's site which sounds weird now but back then it was like this is some other website now that you know that now that you know that YouTube is what it is and that it's necessary as its own thing, that's not going to eat away from your .com",

Well, Snapchat's kind of weird because it's supposed to be ultra private in that even the messages disappear, which I'm assuming is for privacy things for people sending kind of racy snaps. I think I think it's just more because it keeps it fun, it gives a timer to it where you're just like \"you have to look at this thing,\" you can save the stuff if you want, like a few friends of mine chat on there and uh my friend will save all of our chats so",

So I'm interested very selfishly because Kinda Funny is growing rapidly, like we kind of took the two-year plan for what Rooster Teeth did where they had seven years or whatever of Red vs. Blue before they started doing all the other stuff. We're just kind of like hit the ground running. Let's copy the model that they're doing - they nailed live events, how can we put a spin on a live event? You know, they nail podcasts, how could we do that? Like let's plays, if not invented by Rooster Teeth then Achievement Hunter more so like defined I would say by Achievement Hunter and what they do. We kind of just look at all that and like what's our spin on all those things. So I'm always interested in like the decisions you made and like what you",

How did you kind of take that audience feedback and let it either make the decisions that you were making or ignore it and just kind of do what you felt was right? Well, you know there's two things in there. First of all, when you read comments on the internet, I think you should read comments on the internet, you tend to internalize the negative ones with a higher weight than the positive ones. First of all, most of the views are positive; most people don't leave a comment; uh, most people don't leave feedback. Those are the people who like the video and they come back, and that's expressed in the number of views. Just like the people that don't leave surveys, they had a good time but I'm going to fill out a survey what am I doing that a shitty time? You're going to guess; guess what Yelp people; people I guarantee people will register a Yelp account for the first time to do a negative review.",

Really uh the guy who worked there his name was also Andy he was like Andy what's going hey man I have the same name I was like cool man that's fun and then he was like Hey if you give us a positive review, uh get you a free Entree next time on Yelp. Oh that's cool all right yeah created a Yelp account I was like Andrew is great K he killed it so it's either negative reviews or sellout hacks yeah exactly the only two sides feels like very apt for the conversation we're having where you either are the best person ever giving the fans what they want or you're a sellout right sure no there yeah there is some of that it's always that's that's the negative people.",

I had the opinion that we didn't have to make content like TV, so I gave that storyline an ending point so that people could stop watching the series after 5 years which felt phenomenally long to me at that point and it also gave new people a point to jump on and so that's why we changed it and had more of a storyline and season six to this day is still my favorite thing that I've ever written, you know. and then season seven was super important to me because that's when Gavin Free came on and directed it um I kept telling other people the company \"I want somebody else to take over\"",

It was probably like Wednesday days sometimes when the script would show up, and we'd rush to get everything done. And then we'd have an offseason to show run for 20 weeks a year; four PSA shows were about half the year. Uh, and then the rest of the time we could work on you know things like PAX or Strangerhood, which we tried, you know, branching out into Machinima, and then realized eventually let's not keep pressing the same button again and again; let's do something new.

Yeah, man, see that blows my mind because so Red vs. Blue to me was so important especially in the early seasons.

Same thing happened with Achievement Hunter; we talked about the joke, we make is we called it Achievement, which is... but it sounded like some weird gay porn site. Um, but we kept talking about it and so in my journal on the Rooster Teeth website, I just started putting up Call of Duty videos at the time - like recording me playing my high score - and people went nuts. And then all of a sudden it was this feeling of, \"Oh, now we're doing this.\" Then Jack and Geoff got ravenous about it and they started off and off the races.

God, yeah! I some of their series have 300 episodes, yeah, 400 episodes - that is insane; it's pretty nuts. Yeah, see it's interesting hearing you say that cuz like I...
