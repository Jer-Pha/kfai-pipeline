I mean, look Nintendo's obviously prepping for the Direct for E3. I I mean it's just that would be the most un-Nintendo thing to do on the planet just to spring a new Smash Bros game on people at E3. I just don't think it's going to happen, but again maybe we should call Tim Gettys. Should we call Tim Gettys? Let's call Tim Gettys. We got to call our expert here because Tim probably knows. Can you scroll? He and Reggie are homies, you know they uh they chat they get drinks together every once in a while so we'll see. Let's let's see about this.

But don't you think it's a lie, I mean, that would be really unintuitive to just all of a sudden have a Smash game this early in the console cycle right after Mario Kart, right before Odyssey? Like, don't you think they'd hold this in their pocket for next year? Well, I would imagine that it's an early 2018 release. That would be amazing; that would be amazing if they followed Odyssey with an early 2018 release of Smash. It would be like endgame; this would be the best. That would be like ideal.

Funny story about Christopher McQuarrie - he was sitting in a hotel room with Tom Cruise, chatting about something they were working on, and he got a call about Mission Impossible 4 or five. He looked at him and said, \"Hey man, do you want to direct Mission: Impossible 5?\" And he was like, \"I thought he was joking.\" So I said yes, and he goes, \"Yeah, okay, hold on a sec.\" Someone came back and said, \"You're going to direct Mission: Impossible 5. That rules!\" And he's like, \"What did I just get myself into?\" That's a good story. I think I probably just slaughtered that, but sorry. Uh, Kevin, let's bring up the tips one more time. Hold on.",

So I finally gave in and I bought it on Amazon Prime, I guess for like 20 bucks. This season 2 I watched a couple episodes of the first season with Billy Bob, liked it.
