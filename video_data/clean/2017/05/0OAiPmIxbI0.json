And in that case, I was like I think with like Activision, they're trying to push out trying to get that holiday stuff going on yeah especially with the holidays that's lacking a Halo game you know to compete against not necessarily that they are in the same caliber but with the history of Bungie and all that like I'm sure that has something to do with it.

What you guys read on a not to go on too much of a tangent but what's the deal with World War II uh I'm happy in general like the historical event I guess kind yeah glad we got involved and are you are you stoked for COD?
