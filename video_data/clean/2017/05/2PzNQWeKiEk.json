It collected Mario 1, 2, 3: World and Lost Levels, which is the Japanese version of two great collections of games that hold up today. They were the HD remakes of the NES ones, and that's a classic cartridge that at any point in my life I'm like, 'That's a **** classic.' Yeah, well I remember as a kid growing up my friends would have collections of comic books under their bed and it be worth so much someday turned out to be true. But occasionally there's one in there that's worth a lot and a bunch that are worth nothing. And I think of like the World Championship Nintendo cartridge, there's some things like that in video games that are like an individual thing that are rare but a collection.\"",

But I thought it would be there by now. I mean every once in a while you see like articles written up about like this guy has every Wii game ever made right, and it'll be like a crazy room with all of it, and then it'll sell for something ridiculous. But a lot of times people aren't even trying to sell them; they just want to have it correct. And it goes into one of those things like Pok\u00e9mon cards - they were the huge boom, and these are going to be worth so much, and it's like they were worth a lot for a while, but then over time it went down, but there's a lot of them that are still worth a lot",

So here's a guy trying to sell Super Mario Brothers 3 brand new Nintendo NES factory sealed $299 he's trying to sell it. I have no idea if he's going to be able to. I forgot that's how the boxes looked, yeah just the square re my thing is growing up I uh I grew up I was born in 1989 which meant that any NES game I played was like the NES was done by that time so I had never even seen an NES box until years",

So I had never even seen an NES box until years later because we would just buy a bunch of them at garage sales and they were just loose. So I might be eating my words here. Super Mario Brothers was on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985 - new fact: it seems like it was later than that. Mario 1 was '85, new factory sealed, it's for sale for $620, and that's always the hardest thing is like are people actually buying these things because you see like oh man, the Switch is sold out everywhere, it's selling on eBay for $900,000 - like no, it's not. Someone just has that number there, you know? Yeah, but here's a cartridge: Super Mario Brothers 3, ten bucks. Like that's yellow, I don't know because it's old as hell. Why is that red?

Well, I know also the 8-bit ones were also like very limited when they sold out. Maybe it wasn't Golden Mario; there was some Mario, I think it was the 8-bit Mario. It might have been Silver Mario, not the... or maybe there's an unpainted Mario. Was that one? Think about right anyway. The one thing about retro too is as I mean you make a lot of video game content. We make a lot of video game content and we're constantly asked when we talk about these shows would you guys make a retro show?

And Nintendo - everybody was going nuts on the Switch for this new Zelda game. Everybody I know says it's one of the best games ever, and I think the thing that makes it that way is because it plays like a Zelda game that they remember as a kids. It's light years ahead of it, but it's the way you remember it, and you kind of grow that memory and you add to it yourself. It's like it doesn't play the way the old game plays; it just plays the way you remember it. Yeah, well, that is the importance of nailing nostalgia.

Collect Edition seven bucks, seven bucks there you go but man that thing's sexy, yeah invest in something else but with Nintendo, I think that uh they have that was unique to them for a very long time in the video game industry that now PlayStation is finally kind of kind of has like PlayStation been on for 20 years so they now have a stable of franchises and characters that people grew up on and I feel like Xbox sure yeah is Xbox is more about the experience and less about the games themselves I think where there's like you know Halo and Master Chief and all that people have their memories but people",

We got to talk to everyone at Rooster Te**h**at might be upset about this and see if they're cool with it.' So we hit you up, we hit Jeff, we hit up our friend Lewis, and um, a couple of other people, and it went all the way up \u2013 talking to Matt, we end up talking to Ezra who was like 'Full Screen' and all that ****. So I'm like, 'Man, it went up there.' Well, we had to talk to the guy that Andy actually worked for, which is the head of the games division, yeah, and uh, yeah, he was...he might not be your best friend; he was very sad.
