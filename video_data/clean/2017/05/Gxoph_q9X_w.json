Who Doctor so um over last weekend I watched an Amazon Prime series called American Playboy: The Hugh Hefner Story. How is it? I see it all the time. I W. I watched that you know good girls Revolt or whatever right and I want to but I saw this one, I didn't I didn't jump um it is a docu-drama so I thought it was going to be more of a documentary series um but I I don't know if you're familiar with the medium of docu-drama but um it's not a documentary in that it's not a totally objective perspective.

And but even then, like, to be fair about my argument, they're obviously going back because it's not selling well; I don't necessarily think this is going to solve their problems. They're going to sell poorly in the internet exists, you can see the problem - this is just a print issue in general. And and I do think Playboy has done a great job in the last couple of years, especially with their digital division, highlighting people and doing photo shoots and stuff that are PG-13, like things they did with Naomi and a lot of those people, and it's just kind of bringing attention to, uh, I'd say up-and-comers - but they're they're more from a different medium than being a model.

Yeah, well, I mean, and that's the thing too, like, depending on what you choose to believe or if there there's a lot of rhetoric that goes into it, but Hefner's original concept was that he was they they touched on this a little bit where he had read um Alfred Kinsey's book, um the name of which is escaping now, but it's the famous book about sex and like and how people no, it's it was actually featured in Masters of Sex, they they talk about the book itself, but can't remember what it's going to be called.

I feel like it's one of those things where... how many times have you asked an upcoming starlet or whatever, \"Are you going to do Playboy?\" And I don't feel like I see that question get asked because nobody would care why I would. It needs to yeah, I will say this though - it's a fascinating documentary; you should watch it because I think you'd really get a kick out of it. Not the least of which is because they were constantly thinking about ways to expand and reinvent the brand, and one of the things that Hugh Hefner was really good at was emerging media and figuring out how to get on those platforms, especially TV. So he pitched a series that was basically like... and you go back and watch it, you're like, \"Holy ****, how did this even happen?\"",

It was basically like I think it was called The Playboy. Well, they had a couple of them - one was Playboy After Hours, but I think the one that came before that was like the Playboy Penthouse. And basically, you'd go up an elevator and it would open, and he'd be like, \"Hi, I'm Hugh Hefner, welcome to the penthouse.\" And it would just be all of his star friends - whoever he could get for that night - just hanging out. He'd be like, \"Come on, let's go,\" and he'd just walk around and just... and it was just a party. Obviously, it was scripted, and they had like moments where you're like, \"Hey, uh, you know coming soon isn't it?\" Yeah, like Miles Davis, why don't you play? He'd be like, \"All right,\" or like Sammy Davis Jr., or like Dean Martin, or like... oh, why don't you sing something.",
