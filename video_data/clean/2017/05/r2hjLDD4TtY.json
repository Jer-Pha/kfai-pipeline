And no, wait. I'm not laughing at that. What I'm laughing at. No, no, no. They couldn't hear it. Okay. Cuz we were muted. But that's the thing. I couldn't hear it either, so it was just muffled. So, it just sounded like one of you guys had your computer on. Got And I was like, \"That's weird.\" if we were broadcasting the music and the flute to us through the TV, which is not normal. Sure.

May the fourth be with you. I'll say the elephant in the room. Star Wars sucks. God, you're so wrong. Just letting you guys know. You should all read comic books during this time.

There's something called the lightsaber theory. She's she's uh Luke Skywalker's daughter. There I spoil the movies for you. They don't think so. They don't think she's this this particular individual uh doesn't think that she's Luke's or or related to the Solos at all or Obi-Wan. She thinks that there's another family that was that was studying under the Jedi. Maybe the Jedi. Yeah, possibly the Jedi.

Darth Vader. Big bad W. Yep. He's few. It's rare. I think that in this day and age, it's rare that you can find someone who owns slaves and be like, you know, I can set that aside. I like that guy.

I think it was like the final like half of the tour, he stepped in as lead singer face. Did Axl Rose ever straighten his act out? Is he still an idiot and like insane No, I'll tell you why. Because I watched the Guns N' Roses behind the music. Uh, no. He went away for 10 years, came back, tried to bring Guns N' Roses back. Totally different band.

It was that it was Metallica and Guns N' Roses and James Hetfield uh goes on like got hit by that pyro and like burned and so Metallica couldn't play so Guns N' Roses comes on but Axl Rose couldn't hear himself so he threw a fit and walked off and they rioted and tore down the stadium.

To be honest, it's really hard to gauge its popularity in the West when our teams in Japan were not able to see everyone's comments and discussion. It's great to interact with fans abroad, but sadly I'm stuck in the development room slurping instant ramen. Ha! Persona 5 is a very Japanese story with some political aspects to it, so I couldn't imagine how Western players would react to it. I did, however, know that Persona 5 was highly anticipated by gamers overseas, even back when we were developing the game. So, I was curious to see how it would be received.

There's a sense of society being responsible for creating this evil and such and Persona 5 is also a superhero story in which you fight villains that are born from within society.

Netflix this week closed 1.4 billion in new debt financing, adding to its 3.37 billion in existing long-term obligations. It's the third time in a little more than two years that Netflix has raised more than $1 billion in debt financing. But the company's mounting debt and content payment obligations have raised a new question on Wall Street. When will Netflix take its foot off the gas pedal?

The figure stood at 15.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, more than double that of the same quarter 3 years earlier.

The market is surprisingly comfortable with Netflix's balance sheet, Reed Hastings said. What do you think, Nick? Are they ever going to turn a profit here? Uh, I mean, I don't know. I don't know what they're angling at on this. Um, this has been their strategy from for a very long time, and they're very good at it. They've been aggressively going after content, now they're actually seems like they've been shifting gears and producing a lot of content in house, which is notably more expensive. Um, I don't know.

I'm sure there's another story somewhere out there that just says Amazon's in the exact same boat where they're just dumping money into this. Well, the problem is longterm. Amazon makes so much money elsewhere. Yeah, but Amazon, if you remember correctly, only started turning a profit as of a few years ago. But that's thing is like I feel like Netflix has this and that's it. You know what I mean?

The danger, he said, is that the pricey content won't resonate with customers. I think they're spending way too much, Patrick said, uh, and have little to show for it. Interesting.
