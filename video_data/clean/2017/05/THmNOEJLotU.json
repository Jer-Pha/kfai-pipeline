Dan Stapleton encountered problems once again with saves being incompatible with current game version preventing him from progressing any further. Stapleton had received a working game save intended to circumvent the save issues only to run into the same crash he previously had on his personal saves. Publisher Bethesda Softworks told IGN yesterday that the company is actively working to fix the issues players are running into with Prey on PC.
