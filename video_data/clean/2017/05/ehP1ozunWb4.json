I love that movie; that's one of my very favorite films of all time. That is a uh, that's one of those movies that I'm like because of the ending specifically. I was like, \"I never want to watch this movie ever again.\" The end; it's so British, it's so British, like yeah, you know? That's it. The firefighter was Sean Connery, and he's like, \"There you are,\" and he's gone, yeah. Bye your house just burned down, yeah. Parents are God.",

Fantastic! Yeah... I love how the '90s was Indian in a cupboard and Page Master which it's just like all it has to do is like little things come to life but it's always friendly and cool. Yeah, this was crazy and it's British too so it's incredibly funny. Yeah, I Bandit maybe",

Yeah, I Bandit maybe I'm looking through this the wrong way, but I feel like the 80s, like, we've gotten more censored as we go with what is acceptable for kids to see because in the '80s, I feel like there was a whole subsect of quote-unquote fantasy movies that could have been kids' movies but were **** terrifying. Like Dark Crystal was terrifying, Labyrinth was **** terrifying - it's the scariest thing I've ever seen. So beautiful, one of the best films ever. That's another one I think a lot of people have heard of but have never seen, which is Labyrinth. I have to go back and watch Labyrinth; Labyrinth is like Legend, watch Jennifer Connelly in that one, and then uh there was also like I always got that one mixed up - I always wanted it to be Labyrinth, but it was always Legend starring Tom Cruise. That one I swear I love that movie; that held up.",

I think this all of these movies are things I've never seen. Oh wow, so I'm going to go down. You guys are aware of who Slap him too well? I've slapped him about; he does a split real good Van Damme. He did Bloodsport, amazing. Based on a True Story by the way, Frank Dux was the real character - real person who went to Hong Kong to fight in this underground like bare-knuckle fight called The Bloodsport. It was like people would bet on it and... so he was an American Soldier; they decided to go do that being chased by the Army because they want him back because he's Frank Dux, and he just splits on chairs for no reason, and it's great.

No matter what time, don't touch yourself. Here's my final one and I think it closed out the topic well: Starship Troopers \u2013 really never saw Starship Troopers; it's not a great movie, no, but it has something about it that makes me want to think that it is.
