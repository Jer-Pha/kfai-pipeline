And then this today I edit a Persona 5 video we're putting up and it was one of those watching the clip like **** do I want to go back and keep playing this and it's like my thought was like I know I need I'm G to get back to it eventually but like prey prey is here, it's like do I I I feel like I need to stop and just knock out prey because that's only 40 hours or you know what I mean like I I should focus on getting something.",
