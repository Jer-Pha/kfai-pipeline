I would start with El Dorado and go from there. Well, we're saying even maybe we should randomize the choices and then track what people pick and then we'll know for sure. Yeah, yeah, thank you, give the internet more more flammable stuff to come after me for. So I feel it's interesting to finally see Sam and Nate together or their first meeting I should say because we've seen them together for so long now for the recap elevator pitch how long when was the last time they saw each other how how long has passed there for",

How long has passed there for their relationship? I don't know if we said this, but it's 15 years \u2013 it's been 15 years since they've seen each other. So prior to the events of Uncharted 1, okay, uh, we're now a few years after Uncharted 3; Nate's now in his 40s, and he's given up on adventure, rubber-stamping his job. And then his brother shows back up into his life, and it's kind of an opportunity for us to get Nate back into the life of adventure even though he's given that up, uh, as well as get into his past and see that relationship with a brother and find out what happened before. And I want to \u2013 I mean, I have to give you credit; the first time I saw this opening cinematic thing, I immediately flipped my script because, you know me: all I want is Nate and Elena to be happy, just let them be happy, and have a happily ever after story.",

And I was like, immediately, \"Oh no, get him back out there.\" This dog still got fighting in him - you know what I mean? But my question for that is: he's settled into this somewhat suburban life, I imagine, kind of like Modern Family. Is that kind of play into the gameplay? Is him being a little bit older playing into the gameplay? Do you have him like Solid Snake aging back in Metal Gear Solid 4 or what? What can you say? I'm not trying to get... I'm not trying to nail this interview, oh uh. One thing that's interesting to us is like Uncharted 3 had this spoiler - had this kind of definitive ending with the characters where we seem to trade one ring for",

So then now also you know there you put out this trailer here at PSX beforehand we had seen the scene in the debut of Laura Bailey's character, Nadine. Right or N? I don't like screwing up names and I do it all the time because I'm stupid. Um, tell me about her, like you know what I mean. How does she fit into this both Laura as the actress, you know coming into this established cast of characters and then now Nadine character who apparently runs her own army and is crazy? So you've seen some of her presence in the previous demo that we showed Nate fighting this uh Army For Hire if you will, uh this South African security firm.

Naen black, naen black was this a hard decision to make as a company? I mean because you knew you had known that there was going to be a headline about that somewhere. We knew there'd be a reaction. Yeah, I spent last night reading a 40-page thread on The Flickcast about this, but actually there's some really kind of thoughtful arguments and I we talked a lot about it at the office about it. It's like when Laura came in to audition for the role. We didn't have the look of the character yet, so we put out a biography, we sent out to casting agents, so we knew we wanted a South African woman, it's kind of a bad-ass has all these dimensions to us, so you know we brought in actors that were black actors, that are white actors, that were South African, yeah, and really just trying to find the best fits for this character but more importantly what we look for.",

At no point was Lara being told to play it black. Yeah, meanwhile, let's try to nail down the look of the character. I really like this; I think it could work. Let's get in the game if it doesn't fit, we'll revert, we'll change out, we'll change the look of the character. And once it was in and we got... I saw an early scene with her, and you see the voice and you see the look of the character, and also like I'm not seeing just the concept art; I'm not seeing animation; I'm not seeing even",

When you play Mass Effect, you could become another race, another gender - you could really kind of embody someone completely different than you. And I think on the acting side, it's no different. Your outward appearance has nothing to do with your performance. Gotcha! All right, you sold me. I was going to start; I hope I sold some of the Gaffers as well. We'll see. You know what? Neo - Gaff I think a lot of time gets wasted on this. I remember when I first started, I was specifically told not to go on NeoA; they're going to hate you no matter what right?

Oh whoa, whoa, we're big time in it now here we go.
