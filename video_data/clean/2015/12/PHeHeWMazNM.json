Definitely good movie, get me going back except for DC Universe Online where I have like the platinum in 15% of the trophies because they've added so many goddamn new trophies. Fun.

The comments, I think, were like completely out of control on that video, and they were quite indicative of a group of people that didn't watch the video.

Like, pulse-pounding, there is no sense of pacing; it's just go, go, go, go, go, go, and I love that - I like that it is more, and I feel like you can't take those comparisons too far though because they are different games. It's not like you can say this is better than Uncharted, and it's like, it's way different from Uncharted, you know what I mean? That's the thing of like, I'm saying my favorite parts are like when you get to a new base camp and you're going through and unlocking these areas, and then you know it was like an RPG where there's side quests around you right, like here's my main objective but this guy's",

That's not Uncharted, you know, Uncharted is point A to B to C to D, yeah. I mean, I personally enjoy that type of gameplay a bit more, it's more my pacing and style, but but you can ignore that here, yeah, no for sure, that's the cool thing.

It was like, I move into an area, and if I want, I can go in guns blazing or I can be stealthy every time, and I'd go through and choke people out, kill them, and poison grenades or throw people, and all this different stuff, and it was like I felt powerful; I felt like they were in my world now.
