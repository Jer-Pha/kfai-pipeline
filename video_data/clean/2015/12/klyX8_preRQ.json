So, there's a good cross network of not only gleaning great info from veterans but learning from them as well. You know, that back and forth is really giving the studio a leg up. We feel like, and a lot of the talent that actually works on our AAA side of the business want to extend and give as much as they can to some of these startups. It's a really good back and forth. I asked Scott Roh (corrected from \"Roy\") when I was talking to him, obviously, he's shepherding Sony's first-party studios in America. How does The A Team, like Bend, pitch a game? And I'm curious now at Santa Monica: how do you guys find the pitches for these smaller games? Are people coming to you, or are you guys kind of sending out scouts to figure out what who you want to work with next? It goes both ways. And you know places like",

I think having the XDEV group and the incubated team on ground level adds a whole another dimension into the job of what I do on a day-to-day basis, that really brings me closer to it, you know. Because there's a lot more action, there's a lot more um sort of dialogue going on day-to-day in terms of the diversity of the production challenges or successes or little little wins. So I I really enjoy it and to watch these young creatives blossom is also another thing that you don't necessarily see as much as you would might want to on the bigger AAA, and um, you know there they're I mean you see it here they're what they're producing is standout, yeah it's awesome. Is there a is there a fear when you get involved with some of these younger more inexperienced teams though that you kind of have to again shepherd them in a direction or or do you guys kind of find the the teams that you think",

You seem to have a pretty good eye for that. Yeah, you know every team, even the veteran-level groups, have challenges. Um, I think what we're looking for are partners that can listen right, listen and take in feedback, and you know we really respect the fact that they have their own identity; they are their own business, their own creative entity. Um, but we want people that can really uh traverse the journey as a partner to all the challenges that are going to inevitably roll out through a six-month to two-year dialogue around creating something from nothing. So um often times I think we've been pretty good at pegging those teams that are willing to uh engage in that partnership and",

Let's talk before I let you go about some of the specifics - we're kind of talking more broadly, we talked about eFinn a little bit. What are some of the games that we can expect from Sony Santa Monica in the next year or so that you guys have announced? Well, I think we're always looking for opportunities to broaden the portfolio a little bit, and that's really where we're spending a lot of our cycles - Chasm, Sunless Skies, and Dead Cells are some examples. And everybody who's in there right now, we're really out there looking at the landscape of gaming, what people are up to, and of course it's ever changing, so there's always that challenge of what's that new blip on the radar that we want to capture and get ahead on.",
