He's an eccentric. Like, you know what? I mean, the funny thing about it is what you're saying is interesting because Max Landis is convinced that Jesse Eisenberg is just doing an impression of him.

Let's not forget Kevin Spacey, the great Kevin Spacey debacle of circa 2000. I mean, that that was I mean, I don't blame his performance as Lex. I blame the fact that they just said, \"Do Superman one again and he was like, 'Oh, I want to be a villain.'\" Okay, good. Glad that's still happening.

And I like that idea because you know you got the the moment in the trailer where he says what are you like stop I could have killed you if I wanted to just stop like what you're doing and you see basically Batman get his ass handed to him for the most part. Um, but then there's the inclusion of Wonder Woman, which is the big wild card in this whole thing is like, how are they going to start integrating all these people with when in the DC universe, they had what, like six movies before they decided to do Justice League, give or take.

I think that they had to show that because they when you put it up against the Marvel stuff, right, with the Civil War, they needed to outdo that trailer. Like, they just had to gain momentum back. Civil War didn't show too much. But to me, the Civil War trailer, eh, it's just more, which is great. Cool. I'm going to see the movie. I know I'm going to love it. At this point, we're sold. We're already invested in all this stuff. But it's like that trailer, yeah, if it showed Spider-Man, everyone would be like, but it's like we don't need that, right?

My biggest critique of the people giving critiques of this trailer is the freaking anyone saying that, \"Oh, that's the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\" Those aren't the **** Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Those are the stupid talking about the part where the Ninja Turtle comes out of the building and goes and then his eyes glow. That was a Ninja Turtle, right? I hate you so **** much. But it's like that thing. That's what Doomsday looks like. This is the DC Comics universe version of Doomsday. Google Doomsday. That's it.

Well, I know it's not smart business and whatever, but like I wish that DC would just take a different tact and just be like, we're not Marvel and we don't have the like we don't do things like they do them. We do things in a more thoughtful way like in a more sober and solemn way like we did with the Batman trilogy where it's like we're going to do our own thing and it we don't have to make this interconnected capitalist-driven kind of universe that we're trying to just one-up each other.

And that was the thing I was telling Greg, like this is Superman's last chance, like with people, I think, in terms of making him super Marvel-type relevant to people. Like they need to nail this. Batman's already relevant because of what Nolan did. So they can possibly ruin him as well. But I don't think they're going to. I think they have a good thing going with Affleck. So I'm just I'm super interested to see how that all goes down. But I wish DC would just take a different more mature approach because that's not what I really mean.

It can be disastrous if it doesn't. And that's like why I think the guys there's they're taking a huge risk, you know, because they could just make a Superman movie or just make a Batman movie or make a Batman versus Superman movie. You don't have to pigeonhole and throw in Cyborg and all these characters in there and you know like we don't you know culminating in the Justice League especially with uh Suicide Squad which I I'm pretty convinced is going to be bad.

So the Joel Schumacher films were a direct product of the dark kind of weird twisted **** up Burton films. And then Nolan came in and was like, well, we can't do either of those, so let's go super real with it. And that was what was so powerful about that. And now they're going the opposite direction. I think they're going in a great direction, don't get me wrong, because I don't think Batman deserves to be 100% real.

I remember this. Every single thing resonated with me in 10,000 stories. Yeah. And the point of it was that it was a literal death trap. Oh, yeah. Like, this thing is insane. I can't believe they let children play on this. I can't believe my parents brought us here and thought this was an okay thing to do. Yeah. And the blog was about how it was crazy and then it was demolished. Now it's like",

Cement slides are like slides made of cement. Yes. Yeah. Like really smooth, right? Well, it should be. It should be. Yeah, I know. Like very old '60s or 70s. So, it would be like this: so, it was two slides. It was like pretty much there was a hill and then they would put cement on the hill. It's more of a hill than a mountain, okay, on the hill and then there'd be stairs going up the sides and then there'd be two like it's like a drag race of slides essentially and it's it's uh it's just cement and what kids would do.

Like you can crack your **head** open. I'm going to Google cement slides. I don't know. Like highly polished. Can you Google this? So, so this is this is where things got real, right? Is there'd be a bunch of cardboard at the bottom of the slide where the kids would take a little bit of sand, bring it up, and you you get up the stairs, everyone's in this like line, you bring it up like hope you don't lose your **sand** or whatever.

I'm going right going right to Twitter with that with no context. You just expect they're big, beautiful kids and you see some tiny kids. No, but I imagine like they would like when you were playing on this thing, I just always imagine you were like 12. Oh, no. These kids look like they're four and their parents are like this is fine.

And it's like, what does it expect the kids to do on this? Like it's literally just a launch pad for them to run and just jump off, break their knees off. It's like there's no other purpose for it than that. Then there were just the classic stumps of logs that just go up at different lengths. Oh, you mean The Christian Bale Batman Begins logs where you have to stand on and people punch you in the stomach and you do push-ups?

There's a common theme here and it's death. All right. Then there like there's two more things, two more main attractions to this park that I'll just never understand. One is what can only be described as what like the remains of a Twisted Metal fight level or even just like a level in Twisted Metal Black. Like it's an entire play structure that's made of metal bars. So, it's just a bunch of metal bars that look like kind of like this if they just kind of just extended everywhere and it was just like there's color, you know, the like not the igloo.

Like none of this made any sense. Oh yeah. And so it's all these damn bars. It's kind of similar to the when you go to like the jungle or uh Chuck E. Cheese or McDonald's like the little place, but instead of it being tubes with floors, it's just sticks that you need to like kind of go and if you fall, you're dead. You're **** dead.

For the record, I don't think the homeless people sleeping in them are part of the design of the playground. That kind of just happens. The designers, or game designers, place three homeless people in it at all times. So there's all this stuff and it's just like I I remember even being little and thinking it was the coolest thing in the world, but also being frightened. I was like, \"This is scary.\" Cuz there'd be the big kids and the big kids were, you know, I'm an 8-year-old and the 12-year-old who might as well have been 30 is running around and I'm like, \"Fuck, that guy's scared.

What's it called? The uh it's American Ninja Warrior but also Legends of the Hidden Temple. It's like freaking advanced version. We're like holy **** But then there's one last thing that please guys look at this link so you can see this cuz I couldn't make this up if I **** tried. It's like how could you make the merry-go-round where if you run around it any more dangerous than it already is? How about you turn it on its side and instead of it going in circles, it's going in like like a mouse wheel. Like a freaking No, it's not even just a mouse wheel. Like a boat.

There's a gift there which is really great. So, it's like these kids would get on two sides and then all of a sudden it's like, well, if we can fit two kids, maybe we can fit four kids. Maybe we can fit six kids. And then it became, how many people can use all their force to freaking make this thing go? And then eventually, like, no joke, this is the one thing I joked about a lot of people dying. No one died that I know of. I'm sure someone did, but homeless guy.

But what are your guys' like childhood playgrounds? When I think you say childhood playground, I immediately jump to Spalding School in unincorporated Glen Ellen, which is where I grew up. Spalding school was like an abandoned school that was in the area that had fields in the back and a playground in the front, and that's where like you'd go sometimes to play, you know what I mean?

Like there I I it didn't have it, but I some other playground I remember had the metal half sphere where you crawl out to the top and then if you fall your your leg gets caught and like you break your knee and you're like hanging there in like turmoil. It had when you were talking about the concrete slide. Spalding had the metal slide where you're like, \"Let's go play at the park and the sun has been baking this in the Chicago heat.\" You go like screaming as you go down if you have anything to go down it.

It works that way. My dad had to pick up my like mangled body and like take me home. Um Yeah. And then I also I mean there are so many memories of just like random playing and I don't know, man. I I also do remember having weirdly specific conversations on playgrounds. like we had this curly slide and I remember hanging out with a kid uh his name was Alex King and I remember sitting in yeah I haven't talked to that kid forever but sitting in this little hut and asking him about God and being like what is this God thing and just like no we're 8 years old and like we were just curious kids and we like come",

It's all like happy feelings whether or not you're breaking your rib or you're cracking your head trying to hang out. We had this there was this little structure that was sort of like a heart.

Like playgrounds bring out the best and worst in you. Oh, definitely the worst. As you get older, it just becomes worse. Like because when you're a kid, it's like, \"Oh, we're just playing. Yeah, we'll do chicken fights or whatever.\" But once you you became nine, maybe I would say, you just become this evil **** Satan spawn. And once you learn about water balloons, that means anyone that's younger than you on the monkey bars, they're getting hit.

Sometimes you're playing football and it's not tackle and then it becomes tackle and you're in your uniform, your school uniform is beating the **** out of each other and then it was only good when it was snow days cuz they would plow there when it had snowed because they plow all the snow into the back corner and then you could go play",

He was trying to be a class clown kind of guy or whatever. And there was this kid, Steve Urkel, who got a whole bunch of IU's. He was he was super smart, nerdy guy or just smart, whatever. But he was, you know, you're kids, you know, I was fat and stupid. He was nerdy. Um, but not the comic booky way in the the nerdy school way. He likes school. Urkel. Not to that level.

Steal this entire stack of IU's. Horrible and dumb or whatever, but whatever. I do that to begin with. And then later that day, I'm bragging about how many IU's I have. And Gary, of course, being smart, me being dumb, saw that I had like he had put like designs on his IU's like with crayons and stuff.
