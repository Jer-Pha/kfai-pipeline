And there's you know, I know his son was talking about how he had a lot of regret about whether or not he should have stayed involved, and he gave them the treatments for Episode 9, that hero, and they just threw it away. Not his son, yeah. And so I think it was good to get some new blood in there. As I said when movies were announced, I think you know these are made by now people that grew up with it. It's not like in this mindset of the people that kind of formulated in the 70s and early 80s; it's a new generation of people like us. So I think the movie, you know, is a reaction to",

Yeah exactly, and that's the reason I think when I was you know in the car ride at home thinking about why this one I like this one so much is that I think it was the parts that I liked the most and the fact that I liked in the prequels, it's vibrant and there's this cool crazy world you don't know right but it was too fake, it was too phonied, it was too CG where and I'm just talking about technical specs for some reason then in you know Empire New Hope all that stuff it always looked dated to me because I got into it you know I didn't start watching till I'm a teenager or whatever",

Harrison Ford wasn't good. You were right about Harrison Ford, right. And that's... that is one of the biggest like worries that everyone would have, you know. And I think that they did a great job with that. The biggest issue I had in terms of acting and stuff, and I don't even want to give this too much thought but like Carrie Fisher was the one thing where like a couple of her lines she wasn't Princess Leia, she was Carrie Fisher, and it kind of took me out of it just because I'm a fan like that.

I'm gonna turn that off. This is Princess Leia, yeah, like this is a character that's important. We can't think of the actress and all of this not to hit on her either; she did a damn good job, you know? It's just this isn't the Princess Leia we saw it from you, like I'm washing it right and I'm watching the movie and it's going... I'm like, man, I really like this character, and I like her, and I like these different things.

Like, going back before you know, to you know the 70s, before '77 all the way to today, unlike these other two - which you know Hamill kinda does more like voice acting in that character shouldn't really do too much. So it's although her one-woman show was hilarious. So yeah, I think they did capture the essence of it. I do think that it is like I said a reactionary and safe movie, and I don't know that that's necessarily a bad thing - but it is like okay, desert planet, droid lands on desert planet, person finds droid, droid has information that needs to get to the same exact person as a white person is captured.

I know they tried to a there's exposition there, but I was still like, alright, because it's the same thing we were keen on being fair, it is the same thing we were complaining about in the prequels, like how all these characters are finding each other over and over and over again.

Second off, based more on the storyline of them trying to make things make sense, like he gets shot, and then they bring attention to it by him bleeding a little bit, making himself bleed, it's like showing he's not you know, he's not a hundred percent; he's angry.

Now it's like, alright, we got that General Hux dude who is like Tarkin but I already loved the like sibling rivalry going on between Tarkin and Vader.

And I was telling you a couple days ago, all I want is one line that references the prequels, like I want at least something that shows that they are canon and all that stuff, we got it, we got it with my saber when I wasn't with the lightsaber line, I mean that's really established in you hope but but when they talk about how the lightsaber was also Luke's oh no I'm talking about when they it's early on and Kylo is all pissed off he's like \"what why why are we losing whatever\" and like should we get like clone troopers we need real like troopers or whatever yeah that is true that's a good point yeah that's a good slide **** you you know yeah it is because that well I",

And they chatter a lot, like that's the other cool thing, like you hear the stormtroopers, the Stormtrooper for instance when Obi-Wan's using mind tricks on them in the land speeder when they're trying to arrest him, yeah, I see that guy stuff. But there's a lot of chatter, like the stormtroopers are built up as humans and real people, not just like doofuses, mm-hmm. And so yeah, I like that as well, like that as well.

There's some... there's some it was I think it's something like that or that was sick man. And and I got to give a shout out to the score, I mean there was Star Wars you know. And I like I was surprised at the underutilization of classic themes - we got a lot of them definitely but in very small portions. And I feel like we got a lot of new music, and each of the characters has an identifiable theme, that's good you know. I like that they had the old but they're bringing in the new, and a lot of the old stuff was just like a tiny little phrase of the song that was a new song - which is like \"oh Han and Leia are here, let's play their love team for a second\" but then let's get into the main theme.",

I'm excited to kind of look at it through a new lens now. I'm gonna pay attention to the little things that I miss 'cause I'm not sure I missed quite a bit. I do want to give a shout out - like there's just kind of the one of the cool things that I think Star Wars fans will appreciate too, as a kind of the lineage that they draw between the Republic and you know this, this new rebellion basically in terms of leadership.
