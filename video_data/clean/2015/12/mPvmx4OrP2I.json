I remember this. Every single thing resonated with me in 10,000 stories. Yeah. And the point of it was that it was a literal death trap. Oh, yeah. Like, this thing is insane. I can't believe they let children play on this. I can't believe my parents brought us here and thought this was an okay thing to do. Yeah.

But I just wanted to kind of appreciate it and like I don't know like I I sent Kevin a link of pictures so we might be putting pictures that that what I'm talking about. I said no. He's kind of lazy.

Like very old 60s or 70s. So it would be like a mountain and then they would put cement on the hill. It's more of a hill than a mountain on the hill and then there'd be stairs going up the sides and then there'd be two like it's like a drag race of slides essentially and it's just cement.

You're walking in a bum arm comes out and tries to stab you with the **** No, but I mean but needles like I remember growing up and needles were a real thing. Like it was like the number one thing. You go to the playground, your mom's like, \"Hey, if you see a needle, let me know. Stay away from this area.\" And like I just grew up thinking that there was needles everywhere. And there was like we maybe one out of every four times like we'd find a **** needle. And it's like that's insane. I had to look out for mountain lions in the sand. We didn't have that.

I'm gonna Google some slides. I don't know that trouble is like highly polished. Can you Google this? So So this is this is where things got real, right? Is there'd be a bunch of cardboard at the bottom of the slide where the kids would take a little bit of sand, bring it up, and you you'd get up the stairs, everyone's in this like line. You bring it up like hope you don't lose your sand or whatever. Get to the top, put the sand on the top of the slide. It's literally exactly a little bit of coating.

So anyways Anyways, it's uh um then then the sand would kind of like coat the whole thing to get it that nice like so you just shuffleboard table. Exact. Exactly. And that it was human shuffle board and you would race the person next to you and the person there'd be someone behind you that would push you down. So these kids are just flying down this thing until they hit the bottom and then they face plant and skid like face first in the sand, you know, and it's like, all right, so that is the most dangerous thing in the world. How do we make it more dangerous? Oh, it's the '90s, so everyone has rollerblades and skateboards, so let's rollerblade and skateboard. That's it. That's",

Watch out, there's a microphone there, Nick. Nick. Nick, don't grow to its level. Nick, be the bigger man. Why are these kids tiny? There's like toddlers doing this. I mean, now is life, right? Like that's why are these tiny? Well, going right to Twitter with that with no context. You just expected big beautiful kids and you see a tiny but I imagine like they would like when you were playing on this thing, I just always imagine you were like 12. Oh, no. These kids look like they're four and their parents are like, \"This is fine. It's totally fine.\" That's what I'm saying. So then in addition to that, there was a giant uh monster truck tire where it was just the tire and then you can get in the tire and just chill and if the kids",

Wait, are these pictures that correct is what we're looking at here? Because this looks like Burning Man. This looks like the most dangerous. It looks like a little bit like Thunderdome. Uh this is Golden Gate Park. Uh search for a playground. Yeah, children's playground is what it's called. There is a link for the people at home. You can you can click and you can follow along with this. So in addition to that, there was the big the big uh uh big wheel thing. Then there was literally just a ramp.

Like it's literally just a launch pad for them to run and just jump off. Break their **** knees off. It's like there's no other purpose for it than that. Then there'd just be the classic stumps of of log that just go up at different lengths. Oh, you mean the you mean the **** uh uh Christian Bale Batman Begins logs where you have to stand on and people punch you in the stomach and you have to like do push. Exactly. Except there'd be like a bunch of them and it's like what? So the kids are supposed to walk across them and if they slip and fall, oops, you lost the game. So there's that.

There's a common theme here and it's death. All right. Then there like there are two more things, two more main attractions to this park that I'll just never understand. One is what can only be described as what like the remains of a Twisted Metal fight level or even just like a level in Twisted Metal Black. Like it's an entire play structure that's made of metal bars. So, it's just a bunch of metal bars that look like kind of like this if they just kind of just extended everywhere and it was just like there's color, you know, the like not the igloo. You're not talking about the igloo, are you? Like the the se the hemisphere like the half circle that's all",

Like the the see the hemisphere like the half circle that's all made of metal. No. See, that's a modern thing. What the **** is that? Triforces. So, it's a bunch of triforces essentially. And um it it was made with like um there's a whole bunch of um zip lines where you can like grab a a metal thing and zip from one area to the next. And it's like there's so much danger here. Like none of this made any sense. Oh yeah. And so it's all these damn bars. It's kind of similar to the when you go to like the jungle or uh Chuck E. Cheese or McDonald's, like the little place, but instead of it being tubes with floors, it's just sticks that you need to like kind of go and if you fall, you're dead. You're **** dead. Now, how can we make it more dangerous? The fact that there's homeless people that just sleep in them. Like, that's just what they do. And they",

Like, that's just what they do. And they don't ever clean these and it's **metal**, so it rains and stuff. Rust everywhere. For the record, I don't think the homeless people sleep in them were part of the design of the playground. That kind of just happens the designers play the game designers place the homeless people three homeless people in it at all times. So So there's all this stuff and it's just like I I remember even being little and thinking it was the coolest thing in world, but also being frightened. I was like, \"This is scary.\" Cuz there'd be the big kids and the big kids were, you know, I'm an 8-year-old and the 12-year-old who might as well have been 30 is running around and I'm like, \"Fuck, that guy's scared. He's sipping on this goddamn thing.\" And then there's the like the monkey bars",

But the monkey bars that are circle rings that move cuz it's like it's like the advanced level ninja show on G4. What's it called? The uh it's American Ninja but also Legends of the Hidden Temple. It's like freaking advanced version. We're like holy **** But then there's one last thing that please guys look at this link so you can see this cuz I couldn't make this up if I **** tried. It's like how could you make the merry-go-round if you run around it any more dangerous than it already is? How about you turn it on its side and instead of it going in circles, it's going in like like a mouse wheel. Like a freaking Oh, it's not even just mouse wheel. Like a boat. It like one of the boats. One of those boat rides. Carnival thing. Yeah. So, what's everyone try to do? Let's **** flip it. Let's go all the way around. And",

There's a gift there, which is really great. So it's like these kids would get on two sides and then all of a sudden it's like well if we can fit two kids maybe we can fit four kids maybe we can fit six kids and then it became how many people can use all their force to freaking make this thing go and then eventually like no joke this is the one thing I joked about a lot of people dying no one died that I know of I'm sure someone did but homeless guy this was the thing where every single time I went someone got injured bad got wrecked mangled is the best way to put it Like, oh",

Like, oh my god, it was a disaster. And now, RIP, cuz it's gone. I'll never be able to see it again. But what are your guys' like childhood playgrounds? When I think you say childhood playground, I immediately jump to Spalding School in unincorporated Glen Ellen, which is where I grew up. Spalding school was like an abandoned school that was in the area that had fields in the back and a playground in the front. And that's where like you'd go sometimes to play, you know what I mean? It was it was like Spalding School was active when like my parents were kids, right? I think my dad might have gone there for a couple years, but like this eventually just gets abandoned, has a shitty ass playground out in front and yeah, it's monkey bars over concrete.

It had when you were talking about the concrete slide, Spalding had the metal slide where you're like, \"Let's go play at the park and the sun has been baking this in the Chicago heat.\" You like screaming as you go down if you have anything to go down it. You know what I mean? It's like Jesus. The metal is always the worst, too, because you're like, \"If I'm not sweating, this thing's going to burn me.\" Like, not not burn like heat, but it's going to get that that nice rub. Yeah.

The worst on that is the So eventually this playground had it too, but a lot of the other playgrounds had the the mid90s. This is when the rubber and tan bark started coming in, but it was those like plastic uh structures. Like all the structures were plastic. So you you if it was hot, you get the burn. If it rained, it was all wet and disgusting. Um you always got burned no matter what. But the worst thing was the freaking static that would build up. So anything you touch is just shocking you. It's like so it's like the kids would play the ground is lava, but you wouldn't even need to cuz it was just everything else is electricity surface sucks.

I remember I remember distinctively the first time I stepped foot on like a new playground where that cushy it has the cushy bounce to it and I was like what kind of lame ass kid would play on this like when we were we had sand or wood chips or concrete that was it chips were a part of the wood chips were yeah but wood chips were had their own issues where if you caught a wood chip the wrong way you're picking that thing out of your ass bamboo shoots up your face it's not even I'm not even trying to be political it's just it",

So yeah, I remember I I I remember I remember that really well. like it it was there was something special about being a kid on that verge before things changed because they're different now and and we weren't we grew up in the late '80s like and early 90s and it wasn't like that you know it really wasn't my parents were like oh you want to go swim you know we had we had an inground pool but all all my friends did in our neighborhood and so I was like oh I'm going to go to Tim Gettys",

Yeah, that's that's the difference now, right? Is that everyone has cell every kid has a cell phone and so like when you were a kid, all you needed to do was convince your parents to let you go somewhere and then all you needed was the time you had to be back and you **** off.

It's awesome cuz they can't they can't track you on track your ass. They don't know where they don't know",

It's like even if they don't have the locator, it's like the fact that they know that they have a phone on them, they know that they can contact them, which means that if they call them and they don't answer, that they're dead. No, there's no in between. They're dead or they're answering the phone. You're so right though, man. It's so nostalgic when you think about it.

You hang off the monkey bars each other. Yep. And I remember doing that from like 8 feet to 10 feet and falling right onto my back and just getting the wind knocked out of me. Well, I mean that's the thing is cuz like when you do that and you wrap your foot around, whoever falls falls either on their back or their neck. I don't want to hurt you with them and you're falling on top of them. Yeah. The one of the worst things I ever did in my entire life cuz I'm a **** idiot was I was hanging upside down on the monkey bars like kids do and I had this awesome vision in my head that I'm going to release my legs.

It works that way. My dad had to pick up my like mangled body and like take me home. Um Yeah. And then I also I mean there are so many memories of just like random playing and I don't know, man. I I also do remember having weirdly specific conversations on playgrounds. Like we had this curly slide and I remember hanging out with a kid uh his name was Alex King and I remember sitting Alex yeah I haven't talked to that kid forever but sitting in this little hut and asking him about God and being like what is this God thing and just like no we're 8 years old and like we were just curious kids and we like come to like some little conclusion or realization of what we thought",

It's all like happy feelings whether or not you're breaking your rib or you're cracking your head trying to hang out. We had this there was this little structure that was sort of like a heart. And if you were laying in there with a girl that's that's your wife, that's your that's your girlfriend. You guys are dating.

As you get older, it just becomes worse. Like cuz when you're a kid, it's like, \"Oh, we're just playing. Yeah, we'll do chicken fights or whatever.\" But once you you became nine, maybe I would say, you just become this evil **** Satan spawn. And once you learn about water balloons, that means anyone that's younger than you on the monkey bars, they're getting hit. And then you start to **** create wars with like the rival gangs out of playground. This is my **** playground. What the hell are you doing here?

People made homemade pepper spray. We loved blinding those little kids. We'd toss them and put it on their face. Screw with you. That's not our experience. Colin had a lovely hockey game. Greg and I were too chubby to do monkey bars because I I remember in private school, uh until college but the one school I went to was St. Peter's.

So you just went out into this parking lot and put your hands in your pockets and you were trading Terminator 2 cards and **** But like I people are just running. Sometimes you're playing football and it's not tackle and then it becomes tackle and you're in your school uniforms, beating the **** out of each other.
