It's for uh Tango Gameworks, uh Bethesda published game The Evil Within and I thought that would be fun to do for a backlog week here on Kinda Funny Games because this is a game that's been in my backlog forever. Um and uh I've just not gotten a chance to do it. What I'm playing right now is uh literally the first time I played the game or sat down with it at all except for at events um I played it I think the last time at E3 2014 maybe and I couldn't read anything that was going on on the screen so couldn't play it very effectively. Uh I've been super excited about this game The Game's supposed to be great I'm a huge fan of real survival horror games and a lot of people um have been saying that this is a real survival horror game so uh let's see what I think let's see what you think if you haven't played it and uh you know you can give me your feedback in the comments as",

A riot call one out, just before I picked you up said it was multiple homicides already on scene. I like how his hair is like fluttering around even though there's like no wind. Cho all those patients that's not what happened some patients disappeared some kind of scandal still gives you the creeps doesn't it? Please respond Joseph, you think there's a connection - it's a possibility I believe the records were sealed.

Joseph Keenan, you're with me; we're going to have a look around. Roger that. You don't seem to be much of a hustler, considering it's raining.
