That's Colin Moriarty, that's Tim Gettys, and they finally live their dreams of seeing a new Star Wars film spoiler-free. Did you enjoy it, Colin? Yeah, it was great. I thought it was a great movie, formulaic and safe, sure, but a great movie. And the first real Star Wars movie we've gotten since 1983, which is nice, 'cause it's one of those things where I think Tim will well, maybe maybe Tim will agree or he won't, but the prequels are unfathomably bad, like I and and really sucked everything out of me in terms of liking Star Wars by the time episode 3 came I was like I can't **** stand this **** anymore. Yeah, and this made me you know I I loved Star Wars as a kid and really it was like one of my favorite IP um property and uh I I just just oh the prequels are **** terrible and they beat it out of",

I mean, there are characters important characters that are not practical, yeah, um, but I think that uh it it again it's a reaction to what people wanted and it reminds me of George Lucas apparently said to Kathleen Kennedy at some point when he saw the movie maybe last week or two weeks ago that you know this is...and there was a bitterness in his in in it to me. I don't know if that's true, but like he's like this basically saying like this is what people wanted, yeah, and uh Star Wars fans will be happy with this. And honestly, I think that's the best spoiler-free review we can give: This is what people wanted. Sure, and we are of course champing at the bit, I think, to talk about characters. We were all in different cars on the way home; we didn't talk too much about it, so I think we're anxious to now talk about it and take the gloves off. So ladies and gentlemen, this has been the spoiler-free review. You can click here somewhere on...\"",
