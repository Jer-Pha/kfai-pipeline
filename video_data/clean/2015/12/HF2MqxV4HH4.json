Back in the days, I grew up with GoldenEye 007 and that was like that's what it was to me - that's how you moved and that's how things happened. So when I made the switch over to Star Fox, inverted just made sense then, and also the way you move, the way you would move in GoldenEye, and that just felt right then.

And then, and that's the it's the first-person argument that gets a little more muddled for everyone I think. And that's based on how you review the character you're playing even if I'm playing a first-person I do not view the characters as me, I view it as camera so the so that's where my mentality comes from now I don't have any heritage and plate simulating or anything like that like I don't know why or how I always play like this but I think what you just said makes sense for me.

Like then all of a sudden it doesn't matter if it's a spaceship or a person or whatever - it's just there's a thing and there's **** that shoots. Yeah, so you move it and you shoot stuff and it's just like when you start thinking about it that way, then it should just be default because it is just moving things right?
