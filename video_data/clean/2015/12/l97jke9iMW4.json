But you weren't playing games if you're catching up on Thanksgiving break was last week for us play that entire week not one. That's weird. Were you expecting to though? Yes, I was expecting to use that time incredibly in a thorough way to get rid of some of the games on the backlog. Didn't do a goddamn thing. That's good though. You got to do what you want to do. You can't force it. It's not fun if you force it. I go through these moods where I just don't want to play anything. Sure, and we have Just Cause now. And that's kind of a game I want to play so I'm going to maybe jump into that tonight or something. I don't know. But where do you stand in your Fallout? What's Fallout going to do for you?

Because our next question about the PS lineup comes from Daniel the awesome who wrote in to kindafunny.com/psq just like you can say. Hey Colin, Greg, the PlayStation Plus lineup for December was just announced. This marks three months in a row where PS3 and Vita titles received no write-up or promotion when the games were announced for October. The PS3 and Vita titles weren't even listed in the blog post. Is Sony just losing steam with their older console offerings? Are they just trying to promote the PlayStation 4 even more, or should we expect another shakeup in how free games are delivered to the older consoles like how the annual IGC Instant Game Collection games were removed?

I think they communicate pretty well in terms of like here's the sale we're doing what's going on.",

I don't know if you know this, but I don't think it's ever been brought to your attention before, but you're stuck with whatever name you have. Some people go over to Kinda Funny.com forums where they post their bad names. This one comes from Devon Walker: \"Devon Walker writes Greg Colin, my PSN ID is just 'Putrid,' created in the dark depths of my basement as a youthful PSN ID has become somewhat of a burden.\" I realized it was really an issue when one day I was shopping at GameStop and an attractive cashier was ranting about having no one to play Freedom Wars with. This story sounds fake, but I enjoy it. She is a fellow trophy hunter, not this kind of street persuasion, of course, like us, and needed help chipping away at her 1 million-year sentence, like the Arrogant Bastard I am, I smugly said, \"I can help you.

If you didn't know, every episode of PS I Love You XOXO ends in a song or a segment; we do that intentionally. I like what I was doing there a little bit, Jerry Seinfeld, yeah, yeah, yeah - what is it? Uh, a gay French King. A gay French King - look up that Jerry Feldman, he's a funny comedian. I like him; I love that joke. Uh, singing is shy. This is where one of you goes to kindofunny.com/PSM and submits your song to be played here on this show. If you're listening to an MP3, we play the MP3; if you're watching the YouTube video, we annotate to the YouTube video.
