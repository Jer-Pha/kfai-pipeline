See, I thought he was here; I thought it felt like he was here. Time just weirds me out anymore. So yeah, got sick, got the cancer as I covered in that episode. When you get on chemo, it **** everything up for you. I was super emotional at the time. There's the classic story of when I was out tying my shoes getting ready to walk the dog one day, and Colin came out and said, \"What are we going to do about all these boxes?\" And I started crying and I yelled at him. I'm like, \"He's like, whoa, sorry.\" I was just asking what to do with the boxes, and he walked away. Then I came in and apologized. Colin asked me, \"Yelling and crying happens,\" and I just imagine Colin turns around to walk out and says, \"You're dismissed.\"",

And I came in and I slammed the door behind me, and I went \"****\" and I slammed the door, and as it slammed, the deadbolt slid out, went into the door jam, and bent the wrong way - it's like... and then I I forget what I was so mad about 'cause now I'm like \"****\" in tears because I have to go get a hammer and try to fix this dead bolt when I just want to lay down. You know what I mean? And so my whole thought with it was that this sucks, but whatever - it's like when I went on Accutane, you know what I mean?

And I never came back; I never came back from cancer. I still have a short fuse; I snip at Colin and Chris too much. I cry too easily. I don't know... I mean, I don't really remember you pre-cancer because we weren't like close friends back then. Yeah, but I feel like it's less of a symptom of any of the chemotherapy and more of a symptom of just being adults that have to deal with a ton of stuff all the time now. But I don't... I mean, that's possible, but like I've had I've come to the precipice of having conversations with people if I'm manic, if I need to be on medication because like there I mean like and like I put on a face and like you know Colin's been going through a lot of stuff recently he's talking to me",

So when you say you want to walk away and just play Fallout I really feel like you both do this too, and I think you to some degree feel that there is a little bit of extra pressure on top of needing to do that because you have to be the most informed person in the room when it comes to video games. You know I can see that. I think the bigger pressure is like when I'm playing a game like should I stream this, you know what I mean?

No, a giant black bat - yeah, referring to a black baseball bat. I think that was the term that you guys used if you missed topic one.
