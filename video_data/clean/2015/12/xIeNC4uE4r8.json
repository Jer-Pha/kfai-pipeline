What I can only assume is going to be war between you and me, sure. It's basically started. Unfollow people when they were like, \"I don't like you,\" \"I don't want the haters in my parade.\" But today I can't follow you so I have to fight Ryback for you in your corner. Your phone is like Karate Kid three when he killed that guy by kicking him too hard. Oh nice dark. I think that was Road House. Um, I didn't like the actual way the trailer was put together and I think that was part of the reason why I didn't really vibe with it.

Like am I gonna have to deal with that level of care from Eisenberg the entire time and is he going to ruin the movie for me?\" Like when we walk out of the theater and you check Twitter, everyone's gonna say Jesse Eisenberg ruined this movie. And that was from just that trailer. Is excited yeah, that's gonna know they won't say that one thing it'll be Zack Snyder's Justice League, of course, but not everyone's fault. But I mean, I think going back and watching again, I'm like, \"Okay, it's got more of a playful tone than I'm used to.\" I was expecting it to be a little bit more like The Dark Knight, because some of the other trailers leading up to it were really serious.

It was just it kind of came off. It comes off a little like I am. It makes me a little scared that they're not gonna be able to nail that tone, you know? Cuz that's a very, very thin line. If a little bit to the left, a little bit to the right, and this whole thing's gonna come off as cheesy and campy, and it's not gonna have the intensity that I needed to have. You know, actually since that... You know, the Marvel Universe is supposed to be what it is. The DC Universe is supposed to be kind of a little bit darker, right from what we've been able to cobble together. Yeah, yeah. So that was my take on it.

Yeah, I just worry that that character is hard to nail right and we've been burned before, let's not forget Kevin Spacey, the great Kevin Spacey debacle of 2002. I mean, that was a mess. I don't blame his performance as Lex Luthor; it's the fact that they just said \"do Superman one again\" and he was like, \"Oh, what land?\" Okay, good, that's that's happening. Um, other than that, there were some awesome moments in the trailer now, uh, namely like you getting to actually see them battle back and forth and knowing that I think they've done a good thing so far as far as the story's concerned with knowing that he's going to not be able to win that fight and so there's got to be another reason why he's doing it and I like that.",

I did enjoy that. Yeah, so is this just seeing everything that you've wanted for 30 years come to fruition? Is that just what doesn't matter what they're saying in the trailer doesn't matter how cheesy the lines it doesn't matter what they look like? Is that just it? It could be anything and you'd be excited. No, cuz I mean I think that you can make a bad trailer and I would think like you took me awhile in the first trailer to see. Grazie. I almost felt that the tone in the first trailer felt so much more grounded. I definitely and I don't I'm not a comic reader. I I honestly never been really big into comics but I think sometimes like we've lost this idea that comics are fun, the ground of our playful and I mean you may know this better but would Batman and Superman have that kind of moment?

And so you have to like look into it, like people walking into this movie like my father for instance who's gonna see it, I'm sure, and he likes watching a lot of movies and he's not a superhero body's gonna go see this and he's not gonna have any of this context.

Like I'm actually really into it. I was telling Greg that we've seen these two shots before from the previous trailer, but that shot of him descending in front of the Capitol building is awesome - that's an awesome shot. And the other shot of him like in what looks like Hurricane Katrina or whatever, where they're backlit, yeah, or whatever. I mean, these are amazing shots. Finally, the technology can make Superman look the way he's supposed to look, I think. And I have to say, I really like Lex Luthor - I think that he's really super unsettling and weird.

So the Joel Schumacher films were a direct product of the dark, kind of weird, twisted ** Burton films. And then no one came in and it was like well I can't do either of those, so let's go super real with it. And that was what was so powerful about that. Now they're going the opposite direction, I think they're going in a great direction, looking wrong because I don't think Batman deserves % real. I know, I think there always is going to be an element of he is a super human being not be not informed but super power is that he's Batman yeah and so like there's got to be a little bit of an era of unbelievable ax t the he should be able to do things that are Batman a skin that maybe you look over he's gone right that's kind of a magical fun thing maybe",

Going back to the original conversation she was on about the trailer and it's like how the trailers when you said you didn't think it was that great of a trailer, yes. Like so my thing with that is I enjoyed it for what it was, I thought it was fun, got my energy up, I was into it and like I didn't hate it or love it but I'm like cool, that was my thing. Is this is cool. Um and I don't know all the insider stuff, is like I'm not that hardcore into the DC thing so I didn't lose my **** in the same way that you would have.

It's probably part of his contract, I would imagine he gets actually do that and he probably cared a lot about 300 - nothing doesn't care about this, that was like his first like chance to really break out and establish himself.
