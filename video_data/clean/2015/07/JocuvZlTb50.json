Hello, hello Jim, thank you for joining me. Thank you, it's been a long time coming. It has been, people have asked for this for a while. Yeah, well I mean, we've been planning it for literally years. I think we first met at some party at E3, it must have been, I want to say 2012 at the latest. Maybe even earlier. And we were like, yeah yeah, come on, podcast beyond, you know, all this stuff. And I'm like, yeah I'll do that. And then the next E3 was like, yeah we're gonna meet up somewhere, I'm too busy, so am I, shit. So, but at last, at last the stars have aligned. Yes, this is the first time we've really intersected since that fateful E3. You can still do podcasts beyond, but we just won't be on it. Yeah, plus Max Scoville hosts it now and I've done enough podcasts with that boy. Yeah, fair enough. So Jim, I have no agenda for this other than to say that I just",

And that brings me, I guess, to an interesting question which is like, how are you doing? How is this all going? It seems like you're doing great work, people love you, your growth has been meteoric, so is everything, are you happy with what you're doing right now? The only thing I'm not happy with is that I didn't do it sooner. Like I feel like an idiot for not having tried this whole solo effort thing sooner. It's amazing, it's scary and terrifying and awesome and brilliant and awe-inspiring and horrific all at the same time, all in the best ways.

Possibly, I mean, the amount of, like Konami blacklisted me four years ago now, I think, and I still get so much mileage out of it, like, it's just, whenever a developer, like Randy Pitchford most recently with Gearbox has been throwing shade at me on Twitter and everything, and they don't realize it's just like, it feeds me, and I never start out personal with these people",

You can ignore it and just keep doing your own thing.

And one of my favorite stories regarding that is, regarding a game called Chipper and Sons Lumber Company. This was a game that was trying to get on Steam via Greenlight. It was this kids' game, allegedly children's game, about a robotic animatronic chipmunk that ran around with dead glassy eyes, just gnawing at trees while other chipmunks were in the background as robots, just like that.

Unlike some other people, he didn't take it out on me, he didn't lash out at anyone, but he got very sort of morose about it, got upset with the whole idea, sort of, he intended to make this innocent fun game and got mauled for it and was like, well shit, I blew it. And then he said, well hold on, if everyone says it's creepy, I'll just roll with it. I'll just make it creepy. And the next thing you know, Five Nights at Freddy's is this massive fucking series, because Scott Cawthon heard critics calling his game creepy when he didn't want it to be and then just said fuck it.

Absolutely, and I think one of the things that's lost on maybe some of these developers and publishers, but not many of them, is that you're in it also, not to necessarily protect, but also to kind of advocate for the consumer and for your own audience who are the ones that really are buying the games, that are in the trenches, that play the games. And one of the things that I think might be lost on maybe some of the consumers is that a lot of publishers, at least big publishers, aren't stupid. Like they, when they release a bad game, they know it's bad. They have mock reviews that are stunningly accurate from firms around the world that know how to score games and they know before the game is even in real reviewers' hands how they think it's",

So I'm always shocked when there is a little bit of blowback. It's like you know your game sucks because, you know, Sony and Activision and stuff, they know when their games are good and when they suck as well. So I'm always confused by that and I think that's why the publishers that seem to deal with it best are some of the biggest publishers because they just, they're not dumb. You know, like when Sony released The Order: 1886, I'm not so sure that they thought it was going to be a nine, you know. So there's some of that as well. I think some people think that the publishers are just walking around thinking everything they release is great and I think that we all know that that's not true. No, and they're in the business of shifting products and so long as the product's",

They're out there not really caring about the little people and their little problems. They're just doing their own, you know, eldritch machinations up in the top somewhere and yeah, I think that's why they care a bit less about the criticism which is, I mean it's good for the critics in a way, but it's also not too great for the consumers because we do have a game industry that's in the hands of people who don't give a shit about video games which can be an issue which is why, you know, we talk about why the loss of Satoru Iwata recently was such a huge blow to everyone because this guy was a president of a multinational company who was a game developer, a game player.

He wasn't someone who worked, you know, who could easily work at AT&T or Burger King as the head of their corporate stuff and just moved into games for more money or whatever. This is a guy who lived and breathed games and it's so rare to see that. For all of the fucking executives who come out at E3 with their sports coats and their indie game t-shirts to show you how down and cool they are, Satoru was a guy who actually gave a shit and it's so rare to see that and hopefully as, you know, as generations move up the corporate ladder and sort of populate those positions, fingers crossed, we'll end up with a lot more executive CEOs, presidents who care about games but right now the decisions are being made by people who",

A lot of the corporate-owned games media is run the exact same way which is one of the reasons I wanted to never go back into that circle of just, you know, the guys making the ads happen on game websites and care about games. They care about ads and that's not how I want to do business and yeah, it's something I'd like to see less of in the game industry overall. Yeah, let's talk about that. I mean, what do you think now that we've both broken away from big websites and I think we're both thrilled that we did not only because we're finding success but because it's just more freeing.

This is such a unique thing to be able to direct the content and be the boss of it and, you know, feed in directly to a positive community that wants to see more positivity, not necessarily from the content but just from the way we all treat each other and talk to each other for instance. What do you think the state is of traditional games media? I don't mean magazines because that's not, they don't really exist anymore but in terms of the big websites and stuff, do you think that people are abandoning them and going to YouTube and going to Twitch or do you think that there'll always be a place for that?

Companies generally aren't that great at it. I mean, that's why you get things like major publishers take a new idea like mobile gaming or DLC and then just twist it and mold it until it resembles the old way they sold games. Because they'd rather shape the entire world around them than shape themselves to fit the world. Which is the opposite of how you know survival of the fittest works. You're supposed to adapt to the world, not try and force the world to adapt to you. And you can survive doing that for a while, but you can't survive forever. And I think we've seen that.

And I feel like if they're not in a they're not in a crash so much as they are experiencing tiny isolated pockets of crashiness. Sure, you know, we saw obviously THQ just tumble there; there are various companies that just look like they're on shaky ground. I mean, Sega - like they just seem in a weird position. I mean, recently they came out and apologized to all their fans and everything, and haven't really brought out much lately. And it's it's just odd, and Lord knows what's going on with Konami right now. So it's there it's in a weird state of of this odd recessive kind of thing.
