Yes, it's a game called Danganronpa: Ultimate Despair Saga, which is an absolute spin-off of the Danganronpa series. This time, unlike previous adventure games, it's an action-adventure game. However, the selling points of the Danganronpa series are the story and the characters, so it's a rare type of action-adventure with a lot of overlapping stories. Guys approach Why is it that this time it 's the third game to appear, and why isn't it a normal adventure game",

Guys, why is it that this time it's the third game to appear, and why isn't it a normal adventure game, but an action game? Well, generally speaking, when you say spin-off, it's usually made cheaply using the budget or rather the materials of games that have been made up until now, but if you do that, it's not very normal, or rather boring, so we thought we'd give it a try making an action game ourselves. So, yeah, generally speaking from a business perspective, they wanted to create an action game. Excuse me, so where did this take place in the war? Seeing one familiar character... Happy and are it as sequel-ish? So, where does it fit in as a series? Well, it's basically between 1 and 2. Let me give you a brief introduction to the series. Well, in the end of Danganronpa 1, the outside world is in ruins, or rather, that kind of place is collapsing. What on earth...",

That came up in the words, but it didn't come out in the pictures, so it's centered around that, and the story is about a character called Fukagawa Higashi, one of the survivors of the World, and the younger sister of Uchi Makoto, the main character of the World, and how these two girls stand up to this world of despair. So as you know the World We told that, but we not SH that and so we wanted to go ahead and show that in this game he wanted to show the outside WORLD and What it did become and to do that he decided to Bring Back from the first GAME and as well as introduce The First Game S their Journey through this you WORLD like the Real World of p so How did you SLEon bringing back this specific All to Ah, well, Daga has a lot of great characters, but why did \n\nCorrected corrections:\n- \"Daga\" \u2192 \"Danganronpa\"\n- \"Fukagawa Higashi\" and \"Uchi Makoto\" should be capitalized as proper nouns\n- \"SH that\" is unclear, but it seems like a fragment; I'll leave it as is for now.",

Ah, yes, I really like killers, so I wanted to make an action game about them. The name of the game is Murderer, a killer called Genocide. No, it's Genocider, isn't it? G-Sequence Now we're seeing more third-person action sequence with Genocide jacking her scissors to attack manuclones. I know what in mele Action and earlier we were playing with games. What is the flow of the game like? There is a story sequence, and then the action and so on. Could you please explain a bit about that? Well, the basics are that you progress through the game and when you reach a certain point the story progresses, so in a sense it's like a good old-fashioned action adventure, but Danganronpa fans are mostly not fans of action games, but visual novels, so in that sense the story is very rich and the action game parts",

Basically, speaking, the traditional GAME DESIGN knows there's a point that happens there, say, ACTION sequences more or less sequence again, that said, the team is very, very so, again, the story is you know, a big part of the game at the same time he also is aware that given the fact that the game fans are more used to visual novels, he wanted to make it so that you know even people who aren't necessarily good at action games were able to enjoy having Genji as a playable character, Super powerful, there are other than these two characters, see a lot of obviously preview trailers all are other Iguo.

So this game has that kind of element of replayability, but rather than that, you can meet other characters and make relationships, and there are various books that are dropped in various towns, and when you pick up those books, the conversation between you and Despair expands, and also, as I mentioned earlier, the surviving students from the first game are in various places in the towns, and there is a list of where they are, and by picking it up, you can see the story and the sub-stories. I see, right?

In this town, the setting is that children are using Monokuma to kill adults, and they are controlling the Monokuma clan, so you defeat Monokuma, but you also have to fight those children. Will they also appear in the second game? Well, it's a bit of a spoiler, so I'll just say that I'm very grateful for that. I have them again, more than one.

Yes, that's right. There are stickers in various places that say they are the players of hope for the children who are controlling this town of hope. They are hidden, and by collecting them you can get Monokuma medals, which change the movie scenes, so there is a lot of depth to that. Yes, what is this time's Monokuma? This time's is basically buying the movie data and the music, so it's like a bonus.
