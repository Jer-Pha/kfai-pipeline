Um, but what's cool to me is that all of my friends have watched this show and without watching it together we all just uniquely watched it and I was we all hanging out like we talked about it, I'm like oh crap I can't believe you guys watched it, but this is taken over man, and like Attack on Titan is huge, such a big thing, PR big, it's pretty big so to the point where every convention we've gone to, like I would say maybe it's cuz I'm looking for it but it's",

I think Grisha was one man, I the other one starts in the S, I think Kevin, look it up, Kevin are you back there? There's no reception here. This isn't going to happen, doesn't matter. So to be fair, I fin like the last time I've seen a Titan was like probably I finished a lot earlier than you. I don't really remember all the the names and stuff but um they built these three different walls and it's really it kind of creates this class-based system right?

That's pretty much the only thing you can do if you kill a Titan; if you slash off its arm, it'll eventually grow back, even if you cut off its head - I guess it'll grow back, it's fine, just that one little part of the nape so they create these things, the Omnidirectional Maneuvering Devices (OMDs), that pretty much allow them to shoot themselves up and then use swords to attack the Titans.

Um, so of the first Arc is kind of introduced in the characters and the equipment they use and the basic storyline, and then the end of Arc one and beginning of Arc 2 is him becoming a Titan himself, fighting the other Titans, and the reaction from the military to him being you know this whole time, and how they're going to use him. And so I thought that was actually set up for one of the cooler moments which is at the very very end of the series - this is huge spoiler territory - when they discovered that there's a female Titan, yeah, and they have to figure out what they're doing when he goes out into the Scout regiment, you don't quite know what they're doing, and it turns out they're using him as bait to catch this giant female Titan to figure out who they are.",

I like that it sets you up and then gives you something completely different. Like who **** that was shocking, I did not expect that.
