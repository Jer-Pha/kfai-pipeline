We did do a little San Diego Comic-Con, we had ran around, did a whole bunch of different stuff, met a whole bunch of different people, didn't play too many games. We did have one little opportunity to play some stuff. We played with the Project Morpheus and we played a little bit of Battlefront. Did you get to play Battlefront at all? Battlefront, I played for like five minutes. Okay, it looks awesome, it's super cool. Yeah, we did a little split screen. Uh, Nick had a problem, yeah me and Nick did couldn't invert, yeah Nick couldn't invert which is some **** though they should no, Nick sucks. I hate it when demos don't have the option to let you like do something that simple. Sure, like I understand, I hate that. Nick sucks. Uh, I would play but you'd be all right remember that one day where you started thinking inverted just out of the blue anyways that was cool and all but",

Anyways, that was cool and all, but Morpheus was the thing that I was like, \"Oh, this is awesome!\" Right? Have you played it before, Colin? Yes, okay, several times. Have you played it before? Yes, this is my first time playing it since New York Comic-Con, so I've missed a lot of stuff. This is my first time using Morpheus. I've used Oculus before, and what's that other one? There's another one, but I don't remember it - there's another big one, the Gear VR headset. I've never used that one. Um, Hololens, and then Brandon... Brandon Leech, oh he has his whole thing going so me and Nick did a demo of that last year, so I'm familiar enough with all this VR stuff, and we've talked about VR a million times in the sense that it's you know more gimmicky than gamery, and like what are the real applications for all this and all that.",

Um, I was chasing your characters, yeah. You were chasing us, and it was fun, but it just felt like uh a Mario Party mini-game that you don't really want to play. You're just kind of like, \"All right, I can do this, and it's fine.\" Um, but then the next demo we did was called London Heist, yeah? Get Away: London Heist, whatever was, and you're in a car. So how this was set up was there was a TV in front of us so that the guys that weren't playing could see what we saw, and we just had the thing on. We had two Move controllers in our hands, and the triggers would act as your fingers, so if you would turn your hands like whatever way you turned your hand it would move, and if you moved the",

Um, so he's all driving and stuff, and then you're just in this car, and for the first maybe two minutes or minute, you're just kind of driving, and he's just saying all this stuff. You can kind of just free-form explore what you're doing. Yeah, you pick up a soda, open the glove box, you can open the door and look out, and stuff. Like, you can actually open the door, lean out, and see the ground speeding by and stuff.

I finished the demo. You did it, Nick did it. Like, all three of us were like, \"No, you got to try this.\" You got to try this, even though after the first time, 'cause we'd all seen it, and we're like, \"I think I get it. I get it.\" But it's like, no, no, no. You need to do this. This is actually cool. Yeah, but then my takeaway from it is it reminds me a lot of Time Crisis, like the arcade game. Sure, which is awesome, fun, and it's a great game. I don't need every game to be like that. And guess what? Time Crisis is an experience you play for two hours; you're done. Never need to do it again. You know, like it's just... it's a thing, thing, and it's over with, right?

Same kind of thing, that there has to be those moments where that's happening. Yeah, you know, hopefully the rest of the game wouldn't be like that, you know, there's more sneaking hiding doing whatever. But I mean see that's the interesting thing to me is like I don't know if then it would be fun sure, like then all of a sudden the things that I liked about it are gone and it's no longer immersive and the the moment you add more rules to it besides that you just can't hit this ball dude next to you when it's you can't do this you can't do this you can't do this then it becomes well what can I do what's the point what was cool about this is the fact that I could drive.",

There's the you see the shape, what's the one I'm thinking? You and I used to make fun of this one, I thought Colin, the one where it was on Fox really briefly, where like the cutout is coming... oh that's that's uh uh Hole in the Wall. It's time to face the hole, and then like, and then it shows like this was Hole in the Wall of the game. It was like as you went through, like you know, you start with a very simple square, and it goes through, you have to you're moving your like since you're back behind the square, you have to move your head around to see what the hole is going to be, you're not moving",

That's it, you know? But I think the motion controls are such a big part of this and I think that it's I mean from a commercial standpoint like one of my first thoughts was great so I need two Move controllers for this in addition to the thing that's going to make an even bigger commercial sure, it the PlayStation Camera and the light bar and the Move controllers are all intimately intertwined with each other which makes a lot more sense from the design aesthetic of the controller when you really think about it but uh I'm not",

And that's going to be the key by which you play them, I hope that they figure out a more elegant solution than the Move but I I I wonder if some of those schematics we saw like a long time ago about the controller that breaks apart and stuff like that is actually going to be a real thing. Um it's interesting you say this because you make a point about they just need to go for the easy wins and they just need to do the things that where it works, just do that.

Why did the... why was Zelda not exactly what we wanted it to be? I don't think Motion Plus made it a little bit better but I just don't think it was capable of doing what we wanted to do. I think Morpheus and maybe to a bigger extent Oculus, because it can run on more powerful rigs, is the realization of what we hoped VR would be for 25 years. And because VR's been banging around forever, and it's... but it's now here to stay because they've made people with money are behind it and the technical limitations of it are being uh lifted every day.

I'm a **** fighter pilot, you know. This is fantastic, this is I'm sitting down it already makes sense I'm sitting and I can see my hands and I look down on my legs or whatever but it's it's a first person game and this makes perfect sense you know. And they have so that is an easy win in the sense that it takes thought and it takes time but it's obvious like so people have to look at at these games and be like not everything's going to work as if VR experience, so what will work as a VR experience and then let's do those things.
