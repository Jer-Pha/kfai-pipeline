We'll do the whole head pat thing where I turn it on, give you my Arkham Knight spoiler, and then head tap it off. No, that's now you're confusing them maybe they just turned it off; they don't even know what that means. So this one comes from fan theories over on Reddit - Jason DG1 169 all right um 69 69 69 Jesus go. Let me preface this by saying this theory has been around for a while and I just want to go a bit more in depth. Also, I love the Joker's look so this theory is not some excuse because I dislike the design of The Joker we're going to see in Suicide Squad is Jason Todd - everybody familiar with Jason Todd? Yes, you Rick Todd's brother; second Robin, Sweeney Todd's brother, second Robin he took over after Dick Grayson in traditional canon.\"",

It's someone playing the Joker or someone playing a character playing The Joker if that makes sense. But I have a question about this. Sure. And we have to talk about Arkham Night again, so I'm going to tap my head; my fluffy hair is getting a little spikes on the sides. I don't... I don't care. I like it. Oh, thanks.

Sure, I respect that in the grander DC Universe, but we're talking about like a new Batman trilogy for instance or these standalone Harley movies that are coming. I just don't understand where do they end then? You know, like Dark Knight Rises isn't going to be in Batman no so it's like that's when you end with the Riddler, you end with Freeze or something like that.
