So um there's that thing and people did not like this the internet uproar, they were angry, they're the internet got mad, oh the internet was really mad. So then Mega 64 made a hilarious video that you guys should check out, that uh was making fun of the internet making fun of Nintendo but really they're also making fun of Nintendo cuz that's how that all works, yeah and it was ridiculous, it was really funny and they they essentially pretended they were terrorists and or a terrorist group that was upset that real Metroid Prime was... you're saying it's funny, you're saying it's a funny video for Mega 64, you were also saying they've crossed the line, I mean watching too much but it's that's Mega 64, I'm aware that's I love me but watching the video I was",

Now, the problem with our line of thinking when we apply it to this other game, Bayonetta Hunters, is the fact that applying the Metroid franchise to that if it already isn't selling it's not going to sell this weird not-Metroid game that you don't really want thing, you know what I mean. And that's the thing about Mario - right, Mario sells, and we already know Mario can be applied to a million different things, and the fact that Mario Tennis might come out doesn't stop the next 3D Mario from coming out, right? Whereas with this, I think they're clearly searching for what to do with Metroid. Metroid Other M was a different direction - like, all right, let's see, you know, Jesus Prime critically acclaimed, everybody loves it, these gamers love it, how do we bring it",

That sounds pretty good, yeah. I mean, there's a few things that people ignore about this situation, I think. Hey, like Greg brought up, Metroid historically doesn't sell, and the whole series - 11 games have sold about 18 million copies, which is nothing. So what was the Dark Souls number today? So, we were comparing the Dark Souls one and two, Bandai announces that Dark Souls one and two sold 8 million copies, so like right there you see a game that on average is selling three times more than a Metroid game, and Metroid has this cache with everyone, but it's not a game that people buy.

We have nothing to announce at this time, so people are way overreacting to this. You're right, Tim, this game being existing with probably a budget of a couple million dollars maybe isn't going to stop them from giving 15 or $20 million to a studio to make a real Metroid game that one doesn't exist, you know, at the exclusion of the other. And I think that's an important point, and I think in addition to that, though, it's not even just the fact that they're two different games. It's that this is a 3DS game, that is a Wii U game or whatever the hell NX you know... sorry, but it's like it's it's a",

Mhm, I don't think that's the case. I still believe in my heart that there's a Metroid game in development. I just don't think they can say anything about it right now because there's nothing to say. The game might be embryonic or in pre-production; it might have just entered development. It could be an NX game, in which case they're not going to talk about it at all. Metroid isn't dead; they know what Metroid means. I agree with Greg: I would love to see a really robust 2D side-scroller like Axiom Verge, a robust one we saw on GBA and DS.

And at their board meetings, they're probably like, \"Who cares? No one buys Metroid anyway.\" So yeah, you know, we're going to make a Metroid game to please these people, but it doesn't matter that they're upset; they're going to buy it anyway. Let's back up right there - the only people that care about this are the Nintendo hardcore fans, who are fewer and fewer as every day passes. And when you diminish even that event, that group of people, to the people that care about Metroid, it's a much smaller group.
