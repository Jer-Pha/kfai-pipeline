It's going fast, it really is. So I want to revisit that topic: what is the game of the year so far? What's your kind of review of the first half of 2015? Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain - okay and this is based on two days of gameplay but I'll leave it out and that'll be my surprise guess for what's going to be in the third quarter. So, so far, what's at I what did we say the first time I did this? Do you remember Dying Light? I think we all universally loved Dying Light, didn't we? Probably alright. So then I think from there you add The Witcher and Batman in terms of like big things that mattered exactly. Her Story - I'd put on there too. I think that's going to turn a lot of heads by the time we get there",

I mean, it's trying to be different; it is a very unique idea. You know what I mean? Like, if you haven't played it, and we hadn't played it till we sat down to do it. It's that we didn't know what we were doing. We sat down, everybody said they liked it, we sat down and started playing it, and just getting dumped onto a computer screen on an in-game police record folder, and then trying to piece together what's happening, and then going, \"This is cute,\" and then being like really engaged in the story and where it's going. I don't mean this is the whole thing; like, a lot of people wanted to be jerks when Gone Home was getting all praise, like, \"Yeah, it's it's a fun interactive experience but it's not a game.\" Like, go **** yourself, like are we're going to sit here and well, a game has to have a jump button.",

I think the leveling, the trifecta leveling system is really awesome. You get experience points just for jumping, just for climbing, you get experience points for fighting, you get experience points for beating quests. There's a it's a game that makes you feel like you're progressing. I think Dying Light isn't getting a lot of love because we've got a lot of people have forgotten about it um yet I think it's a game that stands out in my mind still is maybe the best overall game",

Like okay, I get it. But the boss fights thought were clever in the other Arkham games, and I liked them, and it felt like you accomplished something more than just kind of going through the motions of getting further and further through the quest until you inevitably just grab him in a cutscene and or her and put him or her in the car and bring him to prison. So there's that. And I feel like Rocket Kinda Games actually simplified it in some ways and made a game that was a little more, I don't know, a little more traditional. But I appreciate what they did, and I think that they nail the writing, they nail the ambience. They're a studio that has proven that they can do right by other people's IP, especially in IPs as powerful as Batman. So I'm excited to see what they do next so",

It's just like all right jump in land here fight these guys okay this is a Predator mission, this is a Batmobile tank mission, this is a race, this is a tank, this is you know more fighting, this is a tank, this is a tank, this is a tank with the **** tanks uh. And then yeah The Witcher's the same way right. Of like The Witcher is a lot of fun and I like it's one it's when I kick into that critical thing of like if I'm trying to think of like what game is so far this year has the most going for it it seems like The Witcher with all the content it has with the DLC it has with the story with the graphics.

Like for me, that was similar to what you were saying, right? It was uh, it for Batman or whatever, like it was traditional by the numbers. That's how I felt about Dying Light, like the gameplay was solid but it was doing the same thing over and over again to get to the next upgrade point. But that's video games in general, so that's never a quality knock. What do you think? So I mean for me, you know I'm not the biggest AAA game guy, like I'm",

It's like okay this is cool, but it's not like blowing my hair back in terms of what the PlayStation 4 can do, especially like character creator with God of War and stuff like that. But yeah I was going to say Bloodborne to me was the biggest surprise, and I don't think it was a big surprise to a lot of people, but it was a big surprise to me in the sense that I I always begrudgingly played Dark Souls like you know when Dark Souls came out I'm like I don't like Demon's Souls but I'll play Dark Souls I guess and I didn't like it.

I'm just not in that rhythm anymore. I feel like if that didn't happen and I kept playing it and I beat it and stuff, I just felt very satisfied with myself, very smitten with the experience. I think that that game was very good. Um, it's just not one of my games of the year because I didn't beat it; I didn't see enough, but I was very impressed with it and I... I started to finally get it. That said, I think Bloodborne, as I've been saying since the first time I played it, uh, before long before it came out, is just not like Dark Souls in a lot of ways. I think that it's a little quicker; I think it's got just an element of arcade... I don't think it's the same game and I think that's why it",

And I want to give a shout out as well to um all three of those games that we mentioned earlier - Dying Light, The Witcher, and Batman: Arkham in terms of Greg's point, those all felt like next-gen experiences to me, and might have been the first games that I had played on the console. And I think Dying Light might really be the first one where I was like this is really impressive - I remember looking around being like this is impressive, that this world is this big, there's no loading, um the draw distance is perfect, uh the lighting's great, and I remember being really really astonished with how good Dying Light looked.
