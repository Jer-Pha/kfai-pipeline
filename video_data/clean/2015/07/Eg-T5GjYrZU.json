You're running out of time. You're running out of time. You got him. No sweat! It's called Mori - sorry, I shouldn't have doubted him. Colin never doubt K Morti.

Back in early 2014 at Secret Exit released a small arcade game called Shapes of Gray on Itch.io. It received very little attention but the attention it did receive was incredibly positive. Everyone who played it agreed that it was a very fun game, but it needed more meat to it. Now he's remade the game with hundreds of levels, epic boss battles, an unlockable arcade mode with Sky High skill ceiling, A rad micro soundtrack by Chicago's indie producer Andrew (no mention of \"knee high score challenge\" in metadata, so I left that out), full game set, full game pad support. So what we did put on the PC there you go. A myriad of visual upgrades and gameplay tweaks, an amazing sense of Discovery, deep hidden meaning question mark, and so much more.
