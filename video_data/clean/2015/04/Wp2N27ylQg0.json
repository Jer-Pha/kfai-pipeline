Like remember, you had 'Face' look what I'm about to do - this guy! Oh my God, this is already so much... I'm **** in... I don't know, I'm pretty sure this is an MMO and I am in awe. Um, oh my God, look at his head stuck there - cool. So this, this ANW other questions: so in Sleeping Dogs you could upgrade your character with what they would call 'Face', which was like your cred yeah as an as an enforcer in your gang or whatever, and then you had like your police kind of upgrade system and then like I think your combat upgrade system. So it seems like they have a thing here that's kind of similar, and it seems like it's between you as an enforcer and then I guess you can upgrade your gang - gang's defense, enforcers offense, gang.\"",

I want to slam this guy into everything; you've got to hurry up where he's going to push you away. I don't care. Well, so it's cool that they had like the core, the core mechanics are pretty much like just taken out of the game.

I've got to be honest; quite generic. Not this, this has none of the alertness of Sleeping Dogs to me. Sleeping Dogs was about the environment, it was about the characters, it was about the cut scenes, it was about the voice acting... Yeah, but that's right.
