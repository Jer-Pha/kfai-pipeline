Um, I think like anything we just with any organization that's that big it's just so hard to scrutinize and really have control over where every dollar is going right and that and also I think the bigger problem politically is that we just have the way our system set up is that it incentivizes politicians to stay in power right and that's that's a big problem when when a politician is more concerned with getting reelected than they are with actually uh forcing social change, that's a that's a systemic problem that's an ISS that's a huge issue that we face every day every year or every every year excuse me every day um especially when it comes to the president you know it's it's",

I think we should have universal healthcare. I think it's deplorable that healthcare in this country is in the current state that it is, and we quote unquote have Obamacare but we all know for from I mean it was a interesting eye-opening experience leaving a corporation that gave us healthcare and getting a healthcare policy that really doesn't cover **** and costs a ton of money you know relatively speaking per month.

This is bad. Not because I don't believe in what they're doing, but you can't take a half step, which is what they did.\" They're basically saying, \"We're going to use private companies to give healthcare to everyone,\" and that doesn't work.
