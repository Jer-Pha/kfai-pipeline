Avengers, I know Superman, not all of the Avengers though. But I'm saying if you put it as Avengers, if you made an Avengers game, there was an Avengers game; it was pretty bad, yeah. There was one that was first-person when they released footage of that; never made it and it's just got killed, you know what I mean? Like I think there are these examples of just like the movies right, like that's jumping back seven years, like Ant-Man. You can never put an Ant-Man movie out if you make the right choices, right, and you just build a little momentum get it going; that could be the change over, yeah. I think I would like that. I just want good superhero games, he agrees, he knows all about that. Good, all right guys, topic number three, that was it, you got nothing else?

Right? So I would like to see Nintendo actually step up their in-game functionality and then maybe I'll consider buying them, because I have not bought a single Amiibo yet, and I have a shelf full of Infinity figurines. Do you really do that? I do. Do you play Infinity? I do not all the time. I need to play it more, but it's um it's a hard game.

Crazy dogs wants to know do you think fast and furious should get a decent game with Story made yeah entirely a fast FS game would be awesome if done right but it would never be it won't be done right, it would never be the best you can hope for is would be when they end the franchise that they they start they continue on that way yeah because that would make sense if like you know like you just it picks up I don't know as always Dom's got some **** shop he running or something and vindy is like the main NPC and you like come in and he sees something I don't know he's like the quest Giver yeah exactly I never thought about how",

You don't want to continue the season 11 of The Walking Dead, you always think you do and then you don't. I do. I think it can be okay for it to just be over. I see what you're saying. See, the problem is it's not they're gonna stay, they're outstaying their welcome. Well, yeah, because it's their most profitable franchise ever. Right? I don't agree with that. I think that the movie I just watched should have been the last Fast and Furious. No, think about there's three more coming for sure. Right, not three, not three, at least two more. This is the start of the new trilogy. Oh, I thought it was... I'm sorry, I thought there was a new trilogy Beyond this or whatever. Imagine how bad then the",
