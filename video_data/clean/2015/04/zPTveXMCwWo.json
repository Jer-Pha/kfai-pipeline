This is more punk rock to me; this is more like Sid Vicious. If you rent a hotel room to this man, just expect that he's going to burn the whole hotel down, and you just know that's going to happen. Um, having \"damaged\" tattooed on your forehead, I think it's cool; it's very striking. But again, there's no nuance in that like I know this guy's damaged. Yeah, so putting a putting a tattoo on his face that says damaged is like I don't need that. I mean, it's super cringy. I think it's a good thing though. What was your my initial reaction was I love this; it's obnoxious and I think that's a good thing for what the Joker should be like. This is not the Joker we know, but it's enough of it that we're like all right we can piece all that stuff together.

I'm surprised that you were universally you liked it because what happened to me is somebody sent it to me with no context as often happens on Twitter. They go, \"Is a new Joker,\" and I looked at it, I was like, \"I thought this was fan art.\" I thought this is a Jared Leto photo somebody took in Photoshop, and I was like, \"Gosh, that's terrible.\" Thank God that's not real, and then sure enough, like 10 minutes later all the real tweets started, and I saw the one from Aron (corrected to Aaron) - I'm assuming this is how you pronounce it.

And then I watched the internet immediately react to it, and I was so disappointed in everyone, the people tweeting at Jared Leto and at David Ayer saying, \"Oh man, garbage, you **** ruined this too.\" It's like, wow, that was quite the overreaction to everything we just saw. Let alone the fact that I remember when Heath Ledger came out, everybody thought that was garbage too, you know what I mean? See, that's the difference when I saw Heath Ledger for the first time, I was like, \"Na, they nailed this.\" Like he had a very understated, very subtle, really creepy look to him.

This is the style of uh, like the Zack Snyder universe, where guess what? It's over the top, it's in your face, it's keep just keep punching. It's like regardless of whether or not the the movies themselves were des, like Tim was talking about that... Like someone released, \"What would Man of Steel be like if it was super colorful and saturated?\" It changes. Um, this fits very much with Zack Snyder, which is very, which is very much hyper visual, very very in your face, very very punk rock, very very like we're going to be loud and crazy, and that's... And that's his Joker. And and guess what? That's a that's a purposeful choice because if they were to have played it subdued, what would they continually be uh uh compared to which is Heath Ledger",

I want Nick to design what you think is under there, under there. Yeah, oh it's going to be so naked. Yeah, I came around on it to where I'm like it's in the universe just like when I was talking about with Man of Steel right - like Man of Steel didn't live up to my expectations but once I had the correct expectations I had fun with the movie and now that's why I'm excited for Batman v Superman, still excited for Suicide Squad. I want them to do something different; I want to see something interesting. I want to go into these films and not know exactly what's going to happen and who people are - you know what I mean?

They had him standing in front of the Batmobile and they were trying to polarize it so it would be more colorful, and trying to figure out what's going on. That's the kind of suspense I love around these pictures. That's what I like when they do stuff like that. And I think they've so far... I haven't seen it in motion, but I think they nailed the Bat suit for the first time ever, which is strange for me to say. Looks like Jim Lee.
