The fourth topic - we just have one more sponsorship from ProFlowers.com. Why don't I spoil it? All right, I'm pulling up the new ad. Okay, it's booting up on my Kindle right here. Why you boo up on Kindle cuz that's where I open my PDFs? What's that weird? There's so much happening. It's ProFlowers, ladies and gentlemen. Go to ProFlowers.com. If you click the little blue microphone in the top right corner and type in Patron - that's P-A-T-R-O-N - you will get 100 blooms with a free glass vase for just $19.99. And as you guys might know, I don't know if you're familiar with ProFlowers... I've never heard of it. Okay, well it's this website where you can buy flowers and send them to whoever you want around the world. Probably not - I don't think that's how it works.\"",

I own many of the uh, many video game soundtracks and like orchestrated versions and live versions of all the stuff and that's like that. And I have an issue when the sound quality isn't good, when like the samples they use are like really like just weird MIDI things and all that stuff. And Peace Walker is one of those examples where it's like a lot of it, like some of it was actually orchestrated but majority of it was like just weird electronic sounding stuff which was like a step back after MGS2 and 3 and 4.

Uh, I recently played through the Uncharted series; that soundtrack is amazing. But there's only one soundtrack that matters: I'mma take you for a ride, Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 had a dope ass sound; listen to that forever. That song sucks, to kill myself. I love that soundtrack so much because there's so many games that came out in the 90s that just have this weird feel to them where it's like what the **** were they thinking?

Boom, that was more in Char just drums and **** I I don't know there's Vuua there went to the soccer game somebody shakes them they went to the soccer game uh Greggy do but when you think about like you know Mega Man or Castlevania or Mario whatever like those are iconic because they especially Capcom NES games um and the Konami NES games are iconic because they sound like video games. Those guys were pioneering something that we had never heard before, so it's not like shoehorning classical music or more stoic soundtrack into something.

They're just modern day original chip tune songs but they they have their roots in these different styles that are based on games and like I just think that's like really interesting and cool and like you bring up Final Fantasy. I feel like when you're talking about game soundtracks, like Final Fantasy is probably the most obvious answer and uh, I mean it's arguably the best when you look at as a franchise as a whole.

I don't know, I'm a very big fan of so many different game soundtracks and I feel like I've bought soundtracks of a **** ton of games I've never even played just because I'm like \"I think do you listen to them for leisure?\" yeah like I buy I what what I always end up doing is like oh I love like I have Uncharted from like the collector's edition or whatever from that giant case I have",

Live which was like they took it was all the Super Smash Bros. songs, it's just like a Nintendo medley. If we're getting to top best soundtrack, Smash Bros. wins because it's just like all the iconic Nintendo songs in one thing and Final Destination and uh it's just all those songs live and that's awesome, that's great. I listen to that probably too much. I just think the design aesthetic of games I don't know almost has moved away from the importance of music. I mean I'm just because I'm just thinking about it I'm like when do you think the last point where music really mattered was? Like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time or maybe even later than that but I think it still matters like Super Mario Galaxy, I think it mattered because",

I mean, no, even later than that, but I think it still matters, like Galaxy - I think it mattered because Nintendo just knew what they were doing with that game; it's brilliant. But I think generally, when you think about a game, right, like a shooter and you're moving from point A to point B on the map, and there's a lot of ambient sound and there's a sound of gunfire and all that stuff, but there's no music - there might be a flourish or a crescendo here and there as you turn a corner to a beautiful vista or something like that. But it's not there anymore; you know what I mean? Like games would have been sterile back in the day without music at all times because, like, Mega Man if you were to play Mega Man in 2015 it would be like a huge open-world game probably and all that kind of stuff, but Mega Man was just a side-scroller and it had no context",
