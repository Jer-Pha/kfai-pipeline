All right, Patreon made him think of PA words, words that start with PA, which brought The Park, Jurassic Park, I think that's how it happened. I'm thinking of Park City, Utah, oh it's a nice place, I've been there. What the **** is where is Park City? Olympics, yo, Park City is in it's where Sundance is. Right wasn't there the Olympics there that one time or is that where you went? Is somebody is that where Damon and Nate went to see The White Game? Oh okay, talking about R city map, Kevin Rack City what's Rack City? It's a rap song. All right, hey Greg, Colin, and Tim, I'm add Alfredo, I'm assuming he's gonna talk to you too.

There's an inherent problem there - games aren't movies, movies aren't games, but we always try to connect the two, which isn't the best idea. But I understand what he's saying; if a movie has a slow start, you're still invested after 30 minutes and it gets good at the end. People apply that to games, like \"the game sucked for 14 hours, but did it get better?\" That doesn't count; it's not the same trade-off. If the first 30 minutes of a game suck and I stop playing, then yeah, I'm out 40-43 hours approximately. It's not Apples to Apples; it is.",

I think as consumers you have to be more invested in what you're buying and stick it through right? If you're I think it gets when it gets to the point of like well I always talk about The Last of Us right and the fact that uh you know there was there was a a gamble there for Sony and for Naughty Dog right, of Uncharted three finishes now we're going to put out The Last of Us and hopefully the audience and the consumer is smart enough that that by putting a sticker on the box that says from the creators The Last of Us you understand what that means I'm sorry from the creators of Uncharted you know what that means right it is a new IP it is a new thing it is them going off in a different direction that's you know foreign",

That's you know foreign. You look at Activision, you look at a lot of the other big companies right. They want sequels, they want proven concepts that get out annualized every year, get more and more money. And so for you to go off and do this, you have to get it to a point where the consumer understands or listens to word of mouth or review sites or YouTube or whatever, that this game is good because...or there's a lineage here with these developers because and there's a reason there, and that's how you connect it all. I think what do you think? I mean yeah, I don't know. Um, kind of feel like you can't judge it the same way you judge movies. If the game sucks early on, it just...it just sucks. Um, it does. I mean there's not too many games that I play, I'm just like all right well the mechanics do get better, like no, that doesn't.",

A movie I hold very dear to my heart. We get the story through these kids' experience in a library during detention and their interactions with each other and the interaction with the principal, and kind of just this teen angst going on. But we would be able to learn a lot about them if we were given 15 hours by just walking around the school and being able to go into their lockers and read their notebooks and talk to their parents and do all this kind of stuff. But when you see a movie, you have to have a tight experience, and you can't do that. Games let you have an experience that's not tight, that's why something like The Witcher is so exciting because it's 200 or 300 hours long, and you're going to get a different story for two or 300 hours just",

That's the beauty of a video game. So I think people are being too literal when they talk about storytelling in games, and I don't think it's as pigeonholed as it is in movies. I think that there's a lot of freedom because you can do whatever you want to tell the story. So whether you're playing a game like What Remains of Edith Finch or in Abz\u00fb, which is very emotional, doesn't really talk to you um as we experienced in our let's play on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames, or whether you're playing a game like The Last of Us, which is very protagonist-driven and there really is no antagonist in the game, and you know unless you want to talk about just everyone else is the antagonist maybe or the world, the world um it's about those characters but you still when Ellie's",

But you still when Ellie's going through the record store and like talking about music or she finds the broken arcade machine and starts playing it or you learn about her - there would only be a finite amount of those moments in a three-hour movie or two and a half hour movie that would let you do that. So I don't think games are hamstrung at all, I think games are in a great place for storytelling. The ability of a game to tell a story is going to be heightened as time goes on as people explore and find new things - it doesn't necessarily have to be about player agency. Yeah, player agency is overrated and I think that player agency is actually overdone. What does that mean? Player agency is choice, and you know a very literal way it's just the choice. And that do that really well are exciting we know Fallout",

We know that Mass Effect 4 is going to do that, and we are excited about those games. But it's not necessary, you know. Last of Us doesn't make you let you make any choice at all, including at the very end of the game when you want to, because it's the story it's telling. It's a story that's the thing. When you see creators and developers owning that part of it, right? Like, and that's what I always talked about when we talked about Last of Us; no spoilers, but when you get to the end, I expected there to be a prompt, and there wasn't, and it ended, and that was the story.

Um, I can't even think of an example of a movie that doesn't have a story. But there's a bunch of games that don't have stories or have stories that don't matter because it's about the gameplay. I can't think of anything about a movie that you can say, 'Oh, it's not about the story; it's about the explosion.' You know what I mean? Like, I guess there is some truth to Transformers. Well, I mean, that's true. But like even no, but people use that as an excuse, like, well, the story doesn't matter, but the story does get you from A to B.

There's that, and then like you know the multitude of other games you get to walk a mile on somebody else's shoes and that's why it's so powerful.

People go in there like oh I'm going to role-play as a cop or I'm going to role-play as a drug lord and going to randomly interact with these people right?
