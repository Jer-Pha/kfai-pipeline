I saw The Avengers; uh, me and him both saw it. Um, he didn't like The Avengers; uh, he liked Fury Road better. I haven't seen Fury Road, but you're going to like it better, there you go. Uh, but I said well, why didn't you like it? He goes, well, it's the same old same old. I mean, it's been done before, right? And I said, well, I mean generally speaking when it comes down to movies like that, you have that beginning, middle, and end; you introduce the hero, the hero goes to fight something, he falls on his face, comes back becomes victorious at the end. And I don't know if Fury Road was like that, but I asked him, he said yeah. My question to you is: uh, what makes uh, in your opinion, uh, is everything when it comes down to action movies the same formula? Or I mean, is there such a difference? What makes something like The Avengers worse or better than something like Fury Road if\"",
