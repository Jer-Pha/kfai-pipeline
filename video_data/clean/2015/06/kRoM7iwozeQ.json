Yeah, so we were talking about a game you're gonna have to help me with - what's it called? Perception, no... it's something like that right or is it? I backed it; I mean let me check my tweets. There's a game that was made by ex-Bioshock developers, obviously. Um, you know Irrational Games is no more and those guys got laid off. Irrational Games is Boston-based, so a lot of these guys stayed in Boston and created new Perception - sorry, by Deep End Games. Deep End Games is the new studio, and the game is called Perception. And it's a game that seems to be inspired a great deal by Gone Home, which is a game we very much love, which is more explorative... um, narrative-based. But in this game you play as a blind woman, and what's interesting is that you have no tools at your disposal except for some sort of echolocating kind of thing.\"",

Um, and we were seeing the trailer; the game looks beautiful. I'm not quite entirely sure like what the P...like what the perspective of your character is going to be if she's like truly blind in other words if the screen would be black or whatever, that's Perception yeah yeah or that's the that's how it is. I mean, if you've seen Daredevil on Netflix when they go into his field of view, that's what it looks like, and that's what they're talking about, is like by using your phone or you know throwing things in the room, you get to see you know the sound waves echo off stuff come back to you, you see what it is basically right. But then you're being you're there's this monster around the house too that you're trying to avoid so the question\"",

And when he was on PCK, he's like this game didn't need me at all; all I did was like learn from the master. That's yeah yeah. And then he went and wrote Spec Ops and BioShock, of course, one of the great games of all time. So yeah, I just wanted to bring up some unique games, like games that you've never you know, that are different. You can never make another Sound Shapes; you can make a sequel to it, but there could never be another Sound Shapes. There'll be games inspired by Sound Shapes and stuff, that's what you're talking about, that's what's so interesting about right now.

In the way that, and I've used this analogy before, the Silly Putty thing - when games start they're very simple, we know what that is, and then people start stretching it out in all these different directions, and now there's a game for every mood and everything you're in right, and that's what's awesome. Is that apartment game, a separated place that we did a let's play for? Right, like I immediately went and gave them $80 on Kickstarter, I'm like, \"I love your idea here,\" of this again, it's a narrative-driven game, you know. It starts...

You go through and you play it, and it's just like the weight of being gay and not being able to tell your parents trying to tell your parents and them immediately rejecting it and going back and forth with your boyfriend.

I weirdly like that game. Like, I really enjoy it. And I remember first hearing about it and I was like, \"That's really **** weird. Like, why would anyone like that? Like, why would I want to play it?\" And then I watched a trailer of it and I was like, \"There's something about this... The way that the game has a custom score they made just for it, and like the music kind of changes depending on what you're doing. I'm like, 'Man, there's a lot of this looks like a tech demo but it looks like a cool engaging tech demo.' I want to try it.\" So I just bought it, downloaded it, and then as I was playing it in the first level, you're just kind of flying around... You're learning the mechanics when you first look at it. It doesn't look like a game, yeah. You're like, \"What is an interactive screensaver? What am I doing?\"",

I'm like that's cool, I used to love screen savers, you know, like I like that idea. And then but playing it, like you start going through and then you start getting in the flow of it. Like that's something about video games that I think is unique to gaming is when you're in the zone right? You know, uh, like when you're playing Guitar Hero and you're not even looking anymore, you're just kind of like holy this is just happening, I'm doing it.

But besides everything I just said, besides the fact that this is a weird experience, the gameplay is not that fun; there's not that much going on, but it's so subtle that it's like, that's what made it unique to me. And by the end of it, I'm like, holy crap, that was an awesome game, right? Yeah, that is the unique experience. Flower is a great game. Um, Journey to me was a game where people kept telling me to play; I had a different experience from you because I knew what it was, and people kept telling me to play; I'm like, I'll get to it, I'll get to it when we nominated for Game of the Year at IGN; I was like, okay, like I'm going to play it one day.",

Like, that's my time and place with that game made me cry at the end, I have no idea why, and that was and and The Unfinished Swan was a very similar game, where that's a game I think more along the lines of, it will be ruined for you if you actually know what it is and like what happens in the game. We know the black-and-white kind-of ball-throwing mechanic, but the game changes radically, so um, you know there are unique games like that.

And it's again, I don't know why I played that game until the end but then it's like I was and there was something keeping me doing it so I feel like Journey in a lot of ways is the natural progression of Flower where it makes a lot more sense. You see it from Flow to Flower to Journey, like their entire lineage. Flow never clicked with me, neither did it, but I think it was one of those games that's different and weird and I thought it seemed cool and you play it and it was like I played 15-20-30 minutes of it, I don't need it anymore, you know what I mean?

You're just saying this though, it reminded me - this is like it's not the most unique game by any stretch of imagination, but it has unique elements.

Um, and man playing that game was interesting because we played it since yesterday - I couldn't stop thinking about it really yeah.
