Nick Scarpino, aka Bre, the carbs are back - beautiful pieces of bread today. True story: I've actually been on carbs for a while; I just haven't made a big deal about it. How long's a while? A month? Forever? Why have you not eaten any of Bre's bread here when you're here? All you have is a sad little Ziploc bag full of loose meat, and then you've got an egg - how the hell am I supposed to put those together? You're still eating your brains out every day; you're not seeing. I'm doing... I usually do like more carbs in the morning, so when I go to Starbucks, I get a breakfast sandwich. I'm back on those breakfast sandwiches at night. Last night, I had some hard-boiled eggs at Starbucks before we went to Starbucks - yeah. And then we go; you go to Starbucks twice a day - yeah. Because of this new strategy... That's a good one; I like that you're using the word \"strategy\" first.",
