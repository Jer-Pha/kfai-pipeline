Final Fantasy IV - I want to give a shout out to this very special game. Very emotional game. Uh, probably the first game that was truly emotional that I ever played. Memorable soundtrack, deep mechanics, very long game. Just a fantastic game. Probably the first JRPG that came out in the United States that was superb. Yeah, the Dragon Quest games were good, but or Dragon Warrior games were good, but this was a superb story-driven game. Final Fantasy Tactics - I want to give a shout out to an extraordinary game. Very extraordinary game. Do you mind real quick? Yeah, I forgot we have to give a shout out to the patrons. Damn, there you go. Every thank you for all your... well, that's one way of putting it. I'm bad at it. That's one way of putting it too. Uh, I want to give a shout out to Bioshock - the original Bioshock. I think is an extraordinary game.",

Um, and then Ocarina of Time came out. Arwing time was a special game, and I feel like Majora's Mask was the first Zelda game that had really come out since Zelda 2 that was truly different and resonated with me in a really different way. It was a suitable fitting swan song for Nintendo 64, and I don't think people really put them together that way because it wasn't necessarily the last Z... you know, or last N64 game. I remember something called Conker's Bad Fur Day, yeah, and I remember getting my last purchase on N64 was Dr. Mario. Um, goddamn, you were riding out to the end, oh definitely. Um, I was a big Nintendo fan; I don't know that's lost on a lot of people. I was a huge Nintendo fan when I was a kid, huge.

I felt like Majora's Mask is a special game, and there's a lot of revisionist history about how everyone loves Majora's Mask now, but we all those of us who were there at the time remember that that game was not popular with a lot of people that liked Ocarina of Time, even though it got great scores and did well. But I always ride or die with that game and Wind Waker; I thought those were both very special games.

Setzer is a gambler and you meet him at the Opera House in a very famous scene, one of the most famous scenes in any Final Fantasy game where um Celia has to pretend that she's a woman named Maria who sets her up in love with and is going to kidnap; he kidnaps Celes instead of Maria, and then like you get the airship blah blah um and you once you get the airship you can go anywhere in the world just like you can in Final Fantasy IV. In other games, you start going back and realizing there's a little side quest and people to talk to this kind of weird stuff, and then when you get to the World of Ruin you start realizing that there's characters you can totally never run into at all",

We've talked a great deal about this game so I'm not going to spend too much time on it but Symphony of the Night was a game that no one expected and if you think about it from the perspective of someone in 1997 that is not what Castlevania was. I remember buying it without knowing anything about it, I remember seeing I got my PS1 in August of '97, I got Final Fantasy VII in September, I think then Castlevania came out in October and I played a game called Beyond the Beyond in between that which was a terrible role-playing game; we had it, I think we had a copy for the yeah, we displayed it. That game was awful, awful, Japanese role-playing game. But I remember getting Castlevania and I was a huge Castlevania fan growing up, I had one, two, and three on NES, Super Castlevania IV, you know Bloodlines and all these games.",

Um super no it's not taking anything away from Super Metroid in terms of the way Super Metroid approached game development and game style and and maps and all those kind of things extraordinarily important gameplay less so sprites are too big all these kinds there's a lot of problems with that game but Symphony of the Night nailed something so special that they just kept making it over and over again and people just kept buying it and that was a crazy thing and one of the things I didn't really realize until we had really sat down with Eiji is that the games were profitable and were making money",

And one of the things I didn't really realize until we had really sat down with Koji Igarashi is that the games were profitable and were making money. That one of the major problems seemed to be that they couldn't afford to keep doing that pixel art - you know, like the beautiful stained glass windows and these and the castle vistas and these beautifully animated enemies with many frames of animation. Like it's very laborious, and they can't do it. That's why even Bloodstained, which is a Castlevania: Symphony of the Night successor, is not pixel art because it's too expensive you know. So it's funny to think that those games are so extraordinarily good that they were basically releasing like Madden and people were just eating them up um and uh so Circle of the Moon and all these games I mean Aria of Sorrow I mean oh my God these are excellent games but it all starts with Symphony of the Night, I think that's a really really important game.",

Um, Wild Arms was a very early PS1 game, not very early early, '97 came out six months or so before Final Fantasy VII and I think really got overshadowed because the anticipation for Final Fantasy VII was so high. Um, you know when you're spending $50 on a game in 1997 it's a lot of money still a lot of money today but it was a lot of money back then and you're going to wait until you get the sure thing. But Wild Arms um is a very concentrated and cohesive and focused role-playing game, and I don't really think that there's anything quite like it with um with its story and and especially revolving around Rudy and I won't spoil it for anyone but Rudy Roughknight is the main character and really a deep character.

Media Vision made the game, and they've only made really Wild Arms games, and they still exist. And I feel like that's maybe the single most criminally underplayed and underrated game of all time, and I I really wish that everyone would just go play it and see what's so special about it - it's very hard; it's one of those games where I remember when I played it my brother was one who recommended to me, and he's like \"you will not be able to beat this game without a strategy on you\" - just have to get a strategy on, and he was right.
