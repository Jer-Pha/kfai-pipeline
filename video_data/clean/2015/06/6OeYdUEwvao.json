Yeah, we only care about Sony, F it, we care about real good stuff, but right now guys, we're talking about EA. They just had their thing, it was a thing, and man, I don't know... I've been talking a lot about these press conferences today, I'm like, wow, people have really learned how to make a press conference, like we're getting these excellent press conferences, and then this happens. Maybe you got ahead of yourself and knew that the world doesn't know how to do a perfect one, my God. Now before we get into everything, I want to run through all the things that were shown: Mass Effect Andromeda, all right, y holiday 2016, exciting, starting off strong, starting off good, Need for Speed which is\"",

Need for Speed, which is very fast and furious inspired, yeah... like the OST was legit, the soundtrack sounded awesome. I'm totally in this except it's not Fast and Furious the game, and it should be then. Star Wars: The Old Republic - It's Knights of the Fallen Empire expansion for free, coming soon. People are excited, I guess. Unravel, it's a new IP, it's a puzzle platformer, it's kind of like Yoshi's Woolly World but only the main character y-y, his name is Yarn, yeah... he has the yarn otherwise it's like the rest of it just like a normal world and it looks kind of dope. Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 got a very extended demo that it didn't need. Um, single player will be in for the first time spring 2016.

When first of all, who drew straws at EA was like someone has to go on stage and say let's talk about mobile - talk about, and that poor woman was like \"oh ****\" sorry, damn it; now I got to go on and talk. She was enthusiastic about it though, and then then you think it's over and they're like like no we're going back to sports, so then they talked about FIFA, and then my boy P came out - your he's definitely my boy okay, I didn't know that about you; he came out, I liked him when they they asked a question, he just goes \"ha\" no no, I liked that, that was doesn't give a **** he got his payday to go there and do this but then",

Need for Speed Z's, yeah, cuz it was like they're like \"hey we have this new thing\" and then they just did slides for the longest time before they jumped into this weird live-action thing before they then jumped into sliders and stuff. It was just... it was a conference, you know? I was over there talking to Tyson Gebhart, you know from Super Knockout Boxing, and he's like \"I'm bored\" like \"we're boor\" and I was like \"well this just isn't a conference aimed at us\" and he said \"who's it aimed at?\" Yeah, that's a good point.

Maybe they will if it's coming out in fall 2016, that means that's an E3 2016 game - Trilogy. And then for me, I said yes, a Second Star Wars game tied into the movie and releases this fall, but uh, that didn't happen. But when I looked at Battlefront, even though I was astounded by it and I was so pleased to see it um for the first time, one of the things that stood out to me was I was like yes, this is definitely not a game for kids - what are they going to play? It just reaffirmed it, just reaffirmed like what the hell. This can't be it. I mean I think that I think that Disney Infinity and Lego Star Wars would be the answers, like that's the surefire kit thing, those are going to be good games too, like that's the difference.",

No, they haven't yet, but maybe they will at Gamescom; that's a British studio, so they may not have announced it there. I don't know, but yeah, man, Star Wars - I was sold before I even saw it, but now that I've seen it, I was just like, \"This looks...\" But are you really going to play it? That's the thing. I'm sold on the idea; I will try it out. Like, I don't think I'm going to invest that much time into it, but for me, it is going to be a significant amount of time comparatively to what I would put into other games. Sure, other shooters...

Where you're just like... and then you see the gameplay, and it's like, \"Oh, this isn't just something weird; this is actually something that looks fun and nice and different.\" Cuz when I first saw it, you're like, \"Great, wow, you're really copying the Yarn thing,\" but then you see it, and you're like, \"They're not at all like just one art style for the character.\" But the gameplay looked different; the way they use it looked good. One worry I have about it is, is it going to be too sad? CU it looks super sad. It does look sad, but it's not so much that as much as it looks like it might have too many gameplay mechanics.

Now the game the game looks cool and I'm super happy to hear that they're going to do um single-player, a single-player campaign because I played the original and I liked it but I don't want to play it like that; I'd rather play it by myself and they listened. I was surprised too that they said six million people played it now they gave it away for free and did a bunch of things, but it sold at least a few million copies yeah um so definitely you know I'm disappointed that PopCap's doing these kinds of games but um it looks cool and the single-player campaign was intriguing to me about that particular game but I have no idea what they spent an extraordinary",

It's interesting to look back at our pre-show, we did and like talk about all the things that they could have shown that we were expecting or that they needed to do surprises and all this stuff. And then to get this starting off with Mass Effect was like oh promising, and then it just dropped off right right right. It's interesting, and I think the fact that they from the beginning they were like Star Wars is at the end, it was kind of clear that it was just like that - we all knew that. But it's interesting to me that there wasn't any real surprise, I mean I guess Unravel was a surprise but that's not the type of surprise I think people were looking for sure sure but it's",

But yeah, it is just to me, it's just like I haven't played a Need for Speed game since I used to play all the ones on PS1, and then I went off to Burnout 2, and then I kind of stopped, so that was you know, 13 years ago.
