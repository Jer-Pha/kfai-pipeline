I'm Greg Miller and if you didn't know, each and every month over at patreon.com/kindafunnygames, we put up a tier that is the Video Game Book Club. Three people support that tier. Then they get to come here and talk about whatever video game we picked. So you see that's how it is. It's like there's no reading involved unless it's like Danganronpa or something and you got to read about Mother 4. But in reality, what it is is the fact that yeah, you know, you have all this stuff going on. You get to go in here, you get to play these great games and do all these different things. Now, I'm going to expand up my chat window here because I had it the way I wanted it and then I moved it and then of course old exploit over here went all wonky on me because that's what it does. I'm Greg Miller and I'm joined by all of our guests today. Uh first off, introducing uh we call him Gunplay.",

Now, now Stephen, of course, you were a jerk and didn't actually beat Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. Correct. You didn't even play it. Uh, no, I played the beginning. I remember when and originally on the PSP. I played up to a tank part and then I stopped playing completely and then I lost my save on the PSP and then I loaded on my Vita, got ready to play the book club, and just life happened, and then forgot. Don't blame life. This is on you. This is on you, but I'm happy you're here. At least we can talk a little bit about what you've played before, how you've had your experiences, and the whatnots and the whoas. Kurtis, how are you? Introduce yourself. Doing well. Uh, yeah, my name is Kurtis.\n\nI corrected phonetic mistakes (wanky janky \u2192 wacky), spelling errors (explit \u2192 Greg), and proper nouns (Greg Miller, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker).

Obviously. Exactly. Well, not obviously. When I did the Metroid book club, I was like, that game sucks. I didn't even **** beat it. Um, no. But here we're here talking about Peacewalker. This is a game near and dear to my heart. It is, of course, my favorite video game of all time. It stole for me the title from original Metal Gear Solid on PlayStation 1.

And for me, that was the switch that got thrown. I was like, \"Oh **** this is like the future of games to be totally cliche and stuff that we can tell these stories. We can do all these different things.\" And so then every time Metal Gear comes around, I feel like there's that, oh, will this take my place of the next my being my favorite game? And Metal Gear 2, I thought had a chance with the gameplay. Metal Gear Solid 3 I was not a big fan of. Metal Gear Solid 4 was great fan service, but for me, Peace Walker is the one that caught me off guard. You know, you get a PSP Metal Gear game and you're like, what's this going to be like?

Literally throughout the entire game, I thought it was over. I thought it was going to end, then it keeps on going and it just keeps becoming greater and greater. The entire time I was like, \"Oh, wow. Is this over yet?\" No. Okay, good. Especially like after one point it shows credits and then the game continues onward from there. I'm like, \"Wow.\" Well, see, even for me now, I I was lucky enough I always talk about it for Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker.

We came in, sat down, and played Peace Walker non-stop, a bunch of journalists, elbow to elbow, playing on the PSP. And so for me, there was that thing of I played through it and I beat it and credits rolled and then there's, you know, more missions, all this other stuff. I remember having to have someone tell me about the fact that because I started bitching about the whole Pause thing. Of course, we're going to spoil this game if you haven't played it.

I only did it like an hour ago. I know. But that's the thing. You never know. So like for you Zigger, explain to me what your ending was. What What do you think happened? Where was your ending?

I mean the the levels were so peacemeal you know you would walk to an area and area was only especially in the beginning the areas were so small that it really felt like you were kind of going you know peace meal a little by little and I don't know if that's like other Metal Gear games because I've never played any.

The voice acting is criticized, particularly Snake's voice, which may be considered blasphemy by some fans. David Hayter's voice as Snake is preferred over the game's implementation. The presentation and menus are praised, however. As a long-time Metal Gear fan, expectations were high for Peace Walker, but it delivered with its portable-specific design and well-built levels.",

You know, the levels are broken up, the levels are smaller, but that's because they built it for the schmucks like me that are riding the train and have, you know, 15 to 45 minutes to go through and beat something and go through and experience something. And so, for me, it also played into the power fantasy of being the big boss, right? Of being Naked Snake, and the fact that like I could go in there and own areas. Is like for me one of the things about Metal Gear Solid 3 that I didn't like is the fact I remember that game feeling overwhelming and me me feeling like I didn't really have a chance in the matter right that guards were on top of me they discovered where I was there's too many guys like it was weird things because for me it was easier to wrap my head around you know Metal Gear Solid 1 and Metal Gear Solid 2",

So then you get to Peace Walker and I felt like it took everything that I loved about Metal Gear 1 and 2 and combined it with a portable franchise that I could be a part of. I agree that it didn't feel the same way, but now we have to get to of course Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain and see how they parlay that into it, especially after all that Ground Zero stuff and we already know a little bit about it. I mean Ziggler for you wasn't a problem that it was smaller levels that things were a little bit different. No, I actually enjoyed that.

I played it mostly on the PSP. I did like the first hour on 360, but then I had to keep moving from places and it was just better to play it on the PSP on the go. Sure. So, I played it on my PSP and I thought it felt more like a console experience and I enjoyed it even though everything was more smaller scale. I felt like it wasn't a problem at all. And then Kurtis, did I cut you off or was it Steven? Somebody was about to say something. Uh, no. Well, I was just going to say like to be clear, I really do like to be clear. To be clear, you're a monster. I understand. To be clear, but I I I really did like the game. I just don't think it was I I just didn't think it was console uh quality in terms of",

So I took out my VA and I was about to transfer it and then I was like I don't know if I don't know if I can get it back if I transfer it to the VA and it was this whole big mess trying to figure out how to even do that and I just ended up quitting and kept playing on PS3. So I think that you labeling it as like one of the best games of all time I could see where you're coming from but I think that it is of a place in time.

And I jumped in and when you take the PSP screen and blow it up to a 50-inch at the time in-screen or whatever, and you look at it, it was like, ooh, there are no textures here. And there this is a blocky thing. I went back and watched my video review for IGN for Peace Walker before this on the PSP and when you look at it boiled down on what it was the PSP screen, it looks so much better than when it was blown up.

For me, that was one of the ways around the fact that they weren't a console quad experience without being on a console at the time in design. The fact that you didn't need crazy cutscenes.

They did a whole bunch of stuff. So how much information is out there about Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain? I'm not sure. But yeah, that's a good observation that if you're faulting people around, maybe you're doing something similar there. But for me again it was this fan service of these options I don't know I would have been into in other games, you know, base building uh getting a team outer ops which if you didn't play it for some reason you're watching this you know you would basically these guys you recruited you put on the combat team and then the combat team you could set out to other missions who would come back and bring you resources of course they could lose these missions all these different things but basically they're out there playing and able to come back and do all this different stuff for me the core of it was the fact that I understood throughout that game that I was building, you know, Mother Base. I was building outer heaven. I was building",

I thought it's been interesting that when we play Metal Gear Solid One, Two, Four, we get, you know, Solid Snake's story. We see how all this pans out. We know that he had to kill Big Boss. All these things happen. And then you play Three and you're like, well, Big Boss is the hero, but now he's jaded with the government. Then you get into Peace Walker. And now we get into Five. You have to imagine that Five is where we really see the fall from grace. I feel like Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker was this great story, this awesome story that built up things, but I it was never like I saw Big Boss breaking down like he was about to go the evil route or he was going to start making these crazy decisions.

So, I'm not saying anything against that. What What What haven't we talked about? Do you want to What's on the tip of your tongue about Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker? Okay. The one thing I want to bring up, it's somewhere I think it's like early on in the game where you're looking through the trucks and you see Cojima hiding in the back of the trucks.

Uh besides that some of the levels are super hard and I needed a friend. Um not much. Okay. I wish I knew that uh there was more endings or another ending from what I got, but I mean I'll just go back later and play through that. That was the weird thing is I think the endings and then of course the systems they put in a lot of that like you know again I was at a review event so I unlocked the Metal Gear Solid someone's there and they be like oh yeah and if you go over here you get some like that's awesome and granted now there's the internet and all this other stuff you get to jump into and try that's asking a lot of anybody.

It was a way to get you in there, but I I totally get the fact that I think some of the things were hard to wrap your head around maybe just at on the jump, right, as a as a player at home. I can understand that. Uh Kurtis, what what didn't you like about it? What What are your qualms with that there? Uh one thing that I kind of didn't understand being Metal Gear, I always understood Metal Gear to be more about stealth than anything else. And so when you'd go through a mission, you would get these kind of scores, but I felt like the scores weren't telling me how to get an S rating, you know, or get an A rating, right?

And I was getting like, for example, you get the shotgun, I think, on like mission three. And I was like, \"This game doesn't want me to even use the shotgun because then my base is gonna start, you know, falling apart because I don't have anyone to staff it because I'm killing people instead of sending them back out.\" But I also thought that that was kind of remedied by outer ops in general.

Uh so I thought that that that was really awesome. And then one thing that I also felt was kind of interesting was the pacing at the beginning. I felt like I and I felt feel like this might have been a problem with Metal Gear Solid 4 too or as well is that I felt like uh I was watching maybe 10 minutes of cutscene and then I would get one minute of gameplay in the very beginning. Yeah. And that that was kind of disappointing to me. Sure. Sure. Sure. But they're easing you into it. Xyger, Yeah. No, not Zager. Kurtis, whatever. Whoever you are. I'm mad at Xyger in the chat.

Like you can play Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker however you want, right? Go kill all these different things, but then you get a D if you're using a shotgun and killing all these people. But the fact comes down to, and this is something that I talked about in the let's play over on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames, is the fact that I loved the loadout beforehand, right? So you could go through, do your sneaking mission, full not anybody you wanted. But then if like for me when I was like, I want to go back and just get AI cores. Now that's when I would load up",

And I like that, you know, Ground Zero's picked that up, too, when you hope Phantom Pain will continue it and bring back some of these ideas. That that that was a reason to keep me playing, and I loved being able to go back and tackle a mission differently. At first, it it is that off-putting thing of, well, what the hell? like you're making me play the game this way and then yelling me for playing the game that way. But in reality, like what it is is like, well, that's for later, right?

But you figure like I remember playing Metal Gear Solid one, right? And first off, for a long time not understanding that there was, you know, two endings based on the torture scene, then the internet came around, a little site called IGN.com and I figured it out. And so like when he when you end it with Mei Ling, you're like, \"Oh man, a great happy ending.\" And that's what drove me crazy about Metal Gear Solid 2 is the fact that the game started and the only mention of Mei Ling, right, is when she's sleeping as Otacon and you walk in as Raiden and I was like, \"Ah, what's happening?\" And then we get to Metal Gear Solid 4, they show Raiden or I'm sorry, they show",

He's going to do all these horrible things. But you look at Big Boss and Big Boss also a pretty sad character here when you think about it.

He hits it off with a lady here or there whether when they're in the jungles or maybe on the beach with a nice little, you know, sexy box. That was always weird, too. But his story is sad as well cuz he's just never ever happy again. Never ever ever happy. So, I don't know if I agree with that 100% that he's the saddest character, but he's probably the saddest character. Psycho Mantis is pretty sad as well.

The only reason i think they'd hold on to it is the fact that it's always in their back pocket that, okay, we go and we do this and we're not we're going to ignore the western market, we're going to ignore consoles and, you know, PCs or whatever. If that strategy doesn't pay off immediately, they can be like, all right, well, I'll start working on Metal Gear so we can give something to these people they want and they'll come back and keep doing it. As far as Hideo Kojima, my hope is that if all of this happens, he would leave Konami, that he would go I'd like to I'd love to see him go the Kickstarter route and do something small and simple and this is my vision for this game and no one can get in my way. You know what I mean? And Colin always brings up the fact that he could do that, but he could also go like Amy Henning, right? And just be like, \"Hey, I'm free and EA, Activision, you name it, is going to come to him and be like, \"We will give you a team. we",

Go do this.\" But I still think that in his head, he's got to be sick of the corporate grind, right? The fact that he just left there where he made this thing, made this product, for all intents and purposes, we assume Metal Gear Solid 5 to him is his magnum opus. And now at the very end, right, they're taking his name off of it and removing it from promotional materials. And that's going to leave such a bad taste in your mouth that you're like, \"Fuck it. I want to just make a game.\" And the market exists for me to make whatever the hell I want. And so I want him to go make whatever the hell he wants. If it's a stealth action game, great. If not, I got this game called Volume for Mike Bickle coming out. It's pretty much that. So, let him go make",

I would like him to go to Kickstarter, make something new, something different. I mean, I love what he's done with Peace Walker, and I'm assuming he did a great job with the other ones since I haven't played those. But yeah, it would be interesting to see what he type of game he would make on a Kickstarter. If he would do something similar or something different. I just want to see what he's going to do. Yeah. Yeah. Uh Curtis, what do you think? Uh yeah, I agree with you. I think Kickstarter I just recently funded my first Kickstarter with Ukulele, actually.

And then Stephen, from the cut scene you saw, what would you like to see Hideo Kojima do? I actually would like him to make another uh giant robot game like he did with Zone of the Enders. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz I really really enjoyed Zone of the Enders uh and they also they actually spin off with like an anime and everything like that, right? I really would just like to see him do another like giant robot mech game because the movement and everything of that game was pretty much one of a kind back then for the PS2 because it was like really good graphics but it was really really fast and awesome uh gameplay.

We have from um you like your passion and you what you always say and how you explain it and everything. It pretty much makes me believe like you know like from his point of view this you really believe this this game is like everybody has their own opinions but it is like I think it could be very well.

We're going to have different three guys this time. Not that we don't love these three guys, but different people from last month will do it.
