I mean, they still have this tiny little studio that they built from the ground up, um, three stories, and he just has a little corner where he does all of his storyboarding. He writes the script as storyboard, so he doesn't write a script; he just actually draws as he's going to write it. So it takes him forever to do this stuff, but it's cool to watch how they do all the ADR and all that stuff for animated stuff - it's really worth watching.

Yeah, so a lot of people refer to that period as the Renaissance, not the Golden Era, which is when they actually popularized it with Steamboat Willie and going all the way up to its release.

But that was really expensive, but now you're seeing it's being transposed, where we were talking about this with Ego, with Pixel Art and Bloodstain: Ritual of the Night and Castlevania: Stupidly Hard where just way cheaper not to do like hand animations and hand-drawn stuff anymore. Unfortunately, so technology just kind of reached that point where it's like it's easier to just 3D model things and just animate them as they go instead of having to hand-draw every single frame right. But I still like the look of something like Mermaid Man, I'm not sure probably, but certainly in the '90s like all of those were computer-assisted.

It's like the way my brother animates now, where he draws everything by hand, but it's on a computer, as opposed to... you know, with way and flipping, yeah.
