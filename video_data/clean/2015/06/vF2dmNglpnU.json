I'm well. Does it feel like the old days wearing the headphones? Kevin's off at some dumb wedding. It does. I'm just going to monitor for a few minutes and then just throw him on the ground and step. Don't know that we just bought new headphones. So, it's not a wedding. It's a sexy birthday rendezvous. You told me it was a wedding day. You told me he was at a wedding. Mm- Is he getting married? No. What's the guest of honor's name? Anyways, so what? Paula took him away for his birthday. Yeah. Where'd they go? Um, they went on some weird safari thing. That doesn't sound sexy. Yeah, I saw them at a zoo or something. Sounds like malaria. Yep. It sounds fun though. From what I talked to him, it sounded good. I heard an elephant in the background.

Thank you to everybody who came out to Momocon, came to see us at our panel, hung out with us, came for all of you asking out there, Momoc is Japanese for peach and peaches are a big deal.

They're doing it because George is well known for its peaches. This is a Japanese-centric thing. And so they're just saying it's Momoccon. Like it's it's it's implied, you know. The thing is that most people that even go to Momoccon have no idea that it means peach, right? Including me. I didn't know that until a few days before we even went. It has Peach in the uh official logo. Yeah. From It's all once you see it, it's like the FedEx logo. You can't unsee I just I'm one of those guys that likes names that are incredibly descriptive.

It's not like it's just one you're instead of seeing the arrow, you're seeing the peach in Momo. You always see the peach as a peach. But it's when you know Momo means peach, the logo takes on a whole new meaning. I guess so. Just like when you understand arrow means arrow, FedEx means different things. Okay, now you finally won me over with that argument. I still think he's wrong. Let me think he's wrong. Let me ask you an unrelated question, Greg. Sure. When you pick I always notice you pick up Portillo's with authority. You pick up Portillos as if you've done it once or twice. Once or twice. Does he fit in your hand in a very specific way? Yeah.

You respect each other and in the offseason you might like each other, but when you're on the field, when you're on the gridiron, right, all bets are off. Now, here's the funny thing. It didn't derail.

I think it makes more sense like Michael Strahan versus Brett Favre and there when they go out there, it's just, you know, all classic match up.

I've known for a while, but it was brought up to me not too long ago that Portillo used to bite Christine when she first moved in with you a couple times. Yeah. Not savagely either. I mean, let's be clear, I don't think that's possible for that to savagely do anything. 40. Well, you've seen you seen you've seen him set on a toy. But nonetheless, I was thinking about So, he did that because he was used to being, you know, alone with you. Number one, and then Christine would obviously be sleeping in your bed and he would be kind of cast off. Sure. Jealousy.

We wouldn't say anything crazy, but when Portillo and Greg moved in here in 2011, Portillo has never once snapped at me or barked at me or gotten mad at me at all. So, I feel like I have the advantage right now in Portillo's heart and mind. Heart right here. Mind right here. And I feel like I doubt it. I feel like there's something to be said about I think him and Steyr buried their I was going to say bridges. That doesn't make any sense. They bridges. They mended their bridges quite some time ago.

Um, no, I I mean this is the first E3 in a long time that I was at all exciting or looking forward to going. Like when June came around typically, I was like, **** Because I really E3 is tough and I don't I get why people are excited. I used to be excited too when I'd watch it from afar. But when I went to my first one in 2004, um you know, I I quickly learned that it was um not fun. And really all of the fun for me like at in going to the show and absorbing the show even as a consumer, even though I'm not really I guess a consumer anymore.

The coolest **** happens. It's not like E3 happens and then the best part happens. It's E3 happens and then it just gets worse and worse. So So you know that's the one thing that I like to keep in mind. I as someone who doesn't really like being around crowds and doesn't really like absorbing things and and nerd culture in that way going to conventions and stuff. That's not really like my style. I would love to live in an era like we do now or have lived in an era like we do now where you could watch the press conference and stuff like that because back in the day as I don't know a lot a lot of people remember in 1999 '98 whatever",

So E3 is most fun to watch now from home. Being I I am so confused why a normal person would want to go to this place because a you're not going to get in any of the press conferences if you're not in the media and b then you get to go on a show floor and play a bunch of games and if you don't have press passes or appointments like we do like what we did at IGN then you're going to wait in line. You're going to play three or four games maybe of any consequence a day and then you're going to have to leave. And I understand why people are excited about that.

You know what I mean? If we're on the outside going to I always talk about edit packs when I'll talk to people about packs at a meet and greet and be like, \"Oh man, what did you see today?

So like that's just that's just the reality of the situation. If you can just go and have fun and enjoy, that's different. But that's never been the way I've experienced E3. So that's that's why I understand why it comes off as jaded, but but I am unapologetically jaded because that has been my experience. That's just the truth. I had one E3 that way.

And I wanted that so badly. And then once you get there like I'm not going to wait in line to play this goddamn game. Like I'll watch it. That's cool, you know? But I, like Greg was saying, I don't understand the people that go and want that, but they do. Obviously, there's a huge crowd for that.

And like that's the **** that I live for. Like I wanted to see that. So then I I kind of got out of the press conference and I had to like wrap like get on my phone and try to keep refreshing and figure out all the things that happened and then you just go to the show floor and it's just **** it's a disaster of this just games and people and all this.

There's a lot of people there who had somehow figured out to get in and they're more fans than they are industry. And I'm not saying that that's a bad thing cuz kudos to them. They figured it out. Absolutely. I'm not mad about it.

Sure. Right. You're not you're getting people who know you. They work with you as a professional. They see you in a different light. Whereas when you walk in the show and 40 people want to like get near you, I'm like, \"Okay, this is more like Momoccon than it is.\" I don't know about that. I think that I mean they are industry people. They're just on a different level of industry. Like they're on the blog level and stuff like that. Yeah.

I bet it would be probably easier to get into E3 than Comic-Con. No, dude. If you can't get a ticket to Comic-Con, you're not you're not going. Like that lottery system is absurd.

Yeah. Like that's how that's how secure it is. Like you see it and you just keep walking until you season someone not. But nonetheless, I mean to wrap it up in a succinct way if you're ready to wrap it up to him is I mean my kind of closing argument is that this authentically is the first year I'm like really really excited to go again because we just get to experience it now in a different way. in a way that I think Greg maybe experienced it a little more than I was able to experience it until maybe",

But it's like it's just trust me I'm not lying. Like that's just been my experience. If other people have different experiences, that's that's great. But I'm telling you, the people in the industry I know. No, not like the way people just face gloss over by the time it's June and they're like, \"Oh.\" Because you know what you're getting yourself into. It's not it's never manageable.

And as someone who just doesn't care for previewing games and doesn't care for playing games early because I just look at a game like when I see a game and I'm like, \"Oh, that looks good.\" Um like The Witcher 3 when I saw The Witcher 3 like years ago and I was like, \"Oh, that looks really fun.\" And I didn't I never looked at it again ever until we played it in like March. I'm just going to play it when it gets here, you know? So like Batman: Arkham Knight, like that game looks great. I'm like, I don't even know anything about it. And it's kind of fun going into it. I haven't played Batman: Arkham Knight cuz it's like that's where it especially gets weird when you wait a long time to play a sequel. You already know how it's going to be.

Do we know if it's going to be playable on the show floor? It'll be like Yeah, it'll be it'll be a week out. Yeah. Yeah. It's Yeah. Okay. Cool. Yeah. My biggest thing for playing the games, I don't like previewing games either, just because it's like it seems like a waste, but I just want to know if things feel right. And that's usually for like reboots or like when things come back. It's like I remember when the Tony Hawk um HD whatever was announced, I was like, I need to play it.

It does depend on your sort of mentality toward it. Like, I'm with Colin where I don't like the hype as much as the payoff of actually having the thing in my hands, like in my living room or in terms of things that I like. I don't like seeing a thousand trailers for a movie. I would just rather be like, \"Oh, the movie's coming out. Cool.\" radio silence till I go and see it, right?

Same with games. Like it's not a pleasant experience. It's not. And like just because I get to see it, like what's the point of experiencing when you're drained after going through a freaking war, you know? Which means sitting in a line. No, it's not. I think it's apples and oranges compared to E3. Well, here's the thing. You're up till 4:00 in the morning writing, right? And then the next day you have to get up at 7:00 to keep writing.
