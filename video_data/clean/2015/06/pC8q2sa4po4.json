You you can't tell that cuz this this fake sun we put in the room makes it look like the same thing. But I've been looking over on kindafunny.com/forums and over on our NeoGAF community thread and one of the big things we hear is you want longer let's plays. But the problem of course during the day is that we do the Game Over Greggy show, the Kinda Funny Games cast, Colin Moriarty live, normal emailing, planning for E3, planning for Comic-Con, planning for a million other things that doing let's plays every day means that it's hard to do really long ones often. So, I thought tonight I would jump back into The Witcher 3 and bring you along for the ride for a long let's play. Let's say about an hour. Um, you're looking here, of course, at my skill tree. Uh, I've obviously been playing quite a bit since Colin and I",

You can see now I'm level 21, which is nothing to sneeze at and how long it takes to level up this game. And a heads up if you are uh really into The Witcher, I'm doing side quests. One of the side quests I have right now is kind of story though. Like I'm going to we're going to pop out here in a second and it's not like I'm involved with any of the characters, but I'm a thing I didn't expect has happened. So a heads up that it's going to be a little spoilery there, but 21 all these other things. Jumping into it now. And Geralt is in prison. I am in prison right now. Geralt, uh, Mr. Geralt in prison.

I know you're doubtful, but we should go kill the To find a way to trick the Heim might not be as simple as it seems. Besides, neither method's perfect. What do you mean? Geralt might not survive an entire night in the Witcher's lair. You think the Wild Hunt would try to kill Eredin? No, that would mean losing its leader, but Eredin could just expire. He's weak, and the house will summon painful memories. Whereas to the Wild Hunt, that'll be an opportunity. The more pain the Wild Hunt causes, Geralt, the stronger it'll grow, and the more dangerous it'll be to you. And what about the other method? It sucks. It's stupid. The Wild Hunt is a group of Nilfgaardian warriors, and they're notoriously hard to fool. Plus, the trickster can't know it's a trick. What? The Wild Hunt attacks those who have a guilty conscience truly believe they committed a foul deed. The Wild Hunt strengthens their regret and feeds on it. Meaning, if we're going to the house",

Seems to happen to all men. Take a rowdy Scavenger. A brave knight or a tougher. You all end up wrapped around some woman's finger. What can I say? So, shall we try trekking it first? Yeah.
