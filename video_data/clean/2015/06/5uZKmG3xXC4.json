Yeah, Pacific Time, sure. Yeah, right. Is there a difference between daylight and standard? Yes, yes. PDT and PST - that's why you say PT; you don't put we're not in PST. Well, sometimes half the year you are, half the year you're PDT, half the year you're PST. To not do that, you do PT. Good Lord! Yeah, daylight savings time is a real thing, guys.

I don't think that will happen. I think that's an interesting one. I don't know if that's my original thing was going to be that The Last Guardian is re-revealed for three firmware 3.0 was go and they had some stuff in there you want because they've been working on that. I know, yeah. I mean but this is something you'd want in there. People do underestimate that it's the most requested feature on PlayStation Network and it has been for years. Yeah, so it would be something that I think would be at a press conference but I don't know if they're ready. I don't either but I'm putting it out there and I'm not saying day of it's just it's time maybe they give you a date a window.",

Project Morpheus will be discussed for 20 minutes or less; oh well, it was 15 or 20; I'm saying 20; you can say whatever you want; well, no we had an official thing from the show; I thought I thought it was 15; we settled on did you go; I'm going up to 20; okay so both of us can possibly be right about this.

Yeah, no, I think I think Medium, I think the reason Mediatonic's Molecule game took so long and the reason that they poured a ton of money into making money for that studio until they can get the game out is because all this tech was happening presumably Morpheus was shown to them first because it seems like that's the studio in London that could do something groundbreaking with it properly.

So moving on to my personal favorite Nintendo. I think these are my best predictions. Greg, you can go first. Thank you very much. Tim, are you taking notes by the way? Yes, I am. That's what I'm doing right now. Just making sure my Nintendo predictions begin with the announcement that Nintendo has made up with Amazon.com and Nintendo products will be sold on Amazon.com normally, and not all **** up through third-party sellers. And everything's going to be okay. You're dreaming, buddy! What I don't really know anything about this. Can you can you explain this to me? Sure. If you've never tried to order something Nintendo related off Amazon, you cannot why because they don't get along. Why I don't I don't know if there's ever been a historical reason long has this happened. It's been going on since probably the late Wii era. I kind of vaguely remember this.",

So Mass Effect 4 in 2016, Mass Effect Trilogy before it comes out, yeah, you're getting the Mass Effect Trilogy this year, this holiday season on PS4, Xbox One, PC. Exactly, Mass Effect 4 next year, 2016, probably same holiday time period. Okay, I'm going to go back to Bethesda for one more guess, and it's similar to one of the ones Greg made. Uh, Doom is shown for about 15 or 20 minutes. I'm very excited about Doom IV. Um, and they announced the beta is live now for uh, for people that have um, bought Wolfenstein. Yeah, okay. At the Ubisoft conference, the best trailer shown was a Ubi Art engine game similar to Valiant Hearts. When that got displayed, but what you said, \"the best\" mhm? I Greg Miller will say that is the best trailer, but that's my prediction. I'm going to allow it, but that's a little bit... that's a little much for me, Greg. Okay.",

Um, but it seems like a wasted opportunity, and almost impossible to fathom that they are not going to have an Episode VII game, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. And so you kind of have to announce it soon. I hope it's at least as good as the Episode One game on PS one. I never played that, and I'm sure it was not good, but I played the **** out of it. So I think that that's my bet for the EA conference: that yeah, they'll show Battlefront; they'll talk about it a great deal; they'll be like, \"We also have an Episode VII thing from this studio.\" Here is a look at it comes out later.",

These are games that publishers wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole, and like, even if they broke even, and I don't think they broke even, I think they actually probably made money on those games. Um, that gives them that, that sets the Ubisoft's apart from the EA's and the Activision. Frankly, Activision would never publish a game like Child of Light ever, and they would never let one of their studios make a game like Child of Light. So those are things to keep in mind. So I think it's smarter to take those assets and use them in more unique ways than making another Rayman game that will be there when they're ready.

And then there's the um people that love Legends, that I think are a couple years older than me, and then there's the guys a couple years older than that, like you, that are OG, you know. But everyone has their own generation of Mega Man, I think. Mega is one of the few franchises that has it's kind of like Mario, where it's kind of unfair to hate on Mario games because there's so many different types of Mario games, and just because Mario is in the title, it's not one thing. But yeah, I don't, I don't know.

But there's a lot of murmuring - they're saying like it's out this year, and I don't know how that's possible.
