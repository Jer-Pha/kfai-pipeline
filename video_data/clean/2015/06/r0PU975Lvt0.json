Well, that's kind of the craziest thing about this game is that it doesn't really explain things that well. You just kind of got to learn and but then once you learn, you know, and then everything else kind of starts to make sense. But when you first play this game, you just look even the the display of this is like kind of there's a lot going on. You know, you got the key there's the little like the thing under the key what is that? A it's a bomb is it? Yeah but we just don't have bombs yet yeah okay. But see that's the thing is when you first play you're just like what the hell's happening.

I don't want to die. Yeah, I had Kevin's older sister threatening to tickle me to death if I didn't give her the controller - that's no good. Yeah, it wasn't good. All right, let's freeze these guys so I can deal with this. So here we're going to find the first heart; I think it's here. There it is. So we're going to go in here and he...

Let's just get the candle and get on with our lives before anything gets a little you know gets too crazy cuz we can just attack these guys and get lots of money. Everything's okay, I just want money, I just need eight more, so we'll start going this way, and then we'll go get the candle, and then we'll go up and fight some. See that?

So we're going to cruise through here and just go up, and you know, this is obviously where we got the sword, so we could just go I think over one and then up one - there should be a store here, and I think it's in here that we get the blue candle. Even the little things are just... when you're walking and not attacking, your swords are up, so the things hit it like that's awesome.

So the annoying thing here is you have to get you can't attack when you're in doorways because it's a glitch, and they realize that that wouldn't be fair so when you spawn enemies right on top of you like that you have to move kind of quickly.

And you can use the candle as a weapon. Oh what am I doing? Um, yeah, yeah. But you can only use it once per screen, which is so funny. You just have to go like pause, you just have to go off the screen and then back again. And when you get the red candle, you can use it unlimited amounts of time. It's kind of all coming back, which is funny. These like these enemies are so crude, it's awesome. Like these those skeletons are so crude even by this game's standards, which is you know not you know anything but crude really. And some enemies are so weak that even the boomerang damages them. And these bats are some of those enemies. Okay, get out of here and we'll just make a line for the boss. Be cool if someone dropped a heart for your boy Colin, but I don't know what's going to happen. Okay, I don't want to with these guys very.",
