They're making sense if it's a farmer's market. No, I think it's cute they're doing it because Georgia is well known for its peaches. This is a Japanese-centric thing and so they're just saying it's MomoCon like it's implied you know. The thing is most people that even go to MomoCon have no idea that it means Peach right? I didn't know that until a few days before we even went. It has Peach in the official logo, yeah from Momotaro. It's all once you see it, it's like the FedEx logo, you can't unsee it.

You always see the peach as a peach but it's when you know Momo means Peach, the logo takes on a whole new meaning I guess so, just like when you understand Arrow means Arrow, FedEx means different things okay now you finally won me over with that let me ask you an unrelated question Greg sure, when you pick I always notice you pick up Portillo with authority, you pick up Portillo as if you've done it once or twice, once or does he fit in your hand in a very specific way yeah rib cage right rib cage right in the center of so like one yeah so like you always can pick them up in the right way cuz you only see him real quick now you got always support his butt because he's got the back you know like when I'm picking him up he just starts he's a little more",

So they would actually sit like together, separated by a window, and just sit there for hours. I have like all this film of them doing this in pictures, it's so funny each thinking the other was in prison. Um, so eventually Chloe left and Frederick I've seen him once in a while like roaming around. But I have a white stuffed cat, mhm. And after about 18 months, it's a white Rollo from Tales of Berseria too. And I, and Cheryl actually had the great idea, and I put she's like put the cat at the window and see if Frederick comes and thinks it's Chloe. This was like 18 months after he had last seen her.",

You never do everything you need to do, you don't hit everything you need to hit, and it and it's troublesome. And I'm someone who just doesn't care for previewing games and doesn't care for playing games early because I just look at a game like when I see a game and I'm like \"oh that looks good,\" um, like The Witcher 3 when I saw wi 3 like years ago and I was like \"oh that looks really fun.\" I didn't I never looked at it again ever until we played it in like March.

Well, make no mistake like when you go to music school you have to learn how to play piano. Piano is like the instrument that you do any musical scoring from.

No, I'm not offended by that at all. My friend Christian used to make fun of me; we were in a band together in high school and college, uh, and he would kid around, saying there's musicians and then there's drummers because a lot of people don't think of drums even as an instrument - there's an argument to be made that it's not an instrument in the traditional sense, but um, it's the backbone of every song.",
