If your partner wants you to do something that you're not quite comfortable with but you're open to the idea, like maybe it's not your thing but you're like, \"you know what he or she wants, let's give it a shot.\" Give it a shot, do it, do it with you know be careful, be safe, be sane. Don't be drunk when you're doing it, don't be on any illicit substances when you're doing it. Here's what you don't do: don't just try it out of the blue. Yeah okay that is the worst thing that's the worst thing you could do. As with everything in life that pertains to a significant other, you want them to be okay with what you're doing so you can't just spring it on them. You can't just like they're they're getting dressed and you're in the closet in full ninja gear and then boom you spring it on them you can't do",
