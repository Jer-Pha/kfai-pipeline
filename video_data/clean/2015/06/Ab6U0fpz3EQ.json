So we are talking about Ubisoft running through a little bit of what we saw started off with South Park: The Fractured but Whole. Great name, really sad, exciting in general, are just entertaining, curious, so there's that. Then we got into a new IP called For Honor. I looked interesting, true enough, yes. Then we added the Crew expansion pack called Wild Run. Then a Trials Fusion expansion pack called Awesome Level Max with a bunch of axes which comes out July 14th. Lips wet, I put on chapstick.",

I wish they'd walk away from it for like five years and just be done with it. Then come back and do something special. So I'm curious, what you guys think of because it looks pretty. I love the Victorian setting, but yeah, it was interesting for me because I was editing a little bit while the conference was going on, so maybe that was why I wasn't as into it by the way.

But whenever I see the trailers, I'm always like why don't I like these games? Because this does look cool; that's the thing. And we've talked about this for **** years now - is that Assassin's Creed always looks awesome, it always nails the aesthetic and now is the presentation, now is the story, it doesn't play right, you know?

It would, I feel like they need to like that style of combat is something that Batman perfected - we're just kind of like the reactionary kind of combat where you're waiting and you're plotting or whatever. But for me Assassin's Creed will play better if it was more like Arkham, you know, Ninja Gaiden-like almost, something like that, or got a war like you know, like something that's not overpowered like that but I'm saying like you know sword swinging and kind of moving around fast or whatever as opposed to talking about right.

Yeah I feel like I feel like they know their audience, I feel like they understand and their audience is - For Honor is not the same audience as a No Man's Sky yeah which is not the same as Just Dance in it but they seem to have a touchstone for everyone, they don't they don't linger on any game too long either which I think it's really nice.

Wow, lamb's one thing I kind of wish I liked about Tom Clancy games is that they did add some personality to it, but there's never like that character you kind of just... you know, move forward with throughout all those good Tom Clancy games, right?
