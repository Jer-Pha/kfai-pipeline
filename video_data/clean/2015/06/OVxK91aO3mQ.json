They've shown like a trailer, it looks great, but I mean it's not hands-on or whatever, and I still think their primary market is not the West, so they don't you know I think there's John Harden who's our friend over at Atlus who does all their PR did reiterate that they think it's going to come out in 2015, but I just I just don't see it happening. But I hope it's true actually. GS, they come out and they're like, \"Look at this huge thing; release date worldwide,\" and I'll be like, \"Oh man, humble pie, and I'll eat it up.\" But I just only being told I'm wrong when you don't have a confirmation on the website saying 2015 is not being in your hands.

And remember that a lot of times you know for various reasons, and I'm not saying Atlas would do this, but you know for a lot of reasons publishers say release dates and then have every intention of can't or delaying it. So that which was exactly what happened with Batman: Arkham Knight, um, which was obvious as the day went on where they were like \"Batman's coming\" - what was the original date? November, November, and they're like, \"Oh, never mind, we need eight more months.\" It's like I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you knew you needed those eight months. But all right, I believe you.

Hashtag con is never wrong, never ever. Um, there's a ton of Tim games that obviously for probably the right reasons didn't get enough, but uh like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, it was weird to me how little that game was talked about in the sense of like where was it again? It was the Jeff Keiley thing, the gameplay world premiere of it was on Jeff Keiley's show, that no one saw well not no one saw but everyone was busy watching all these other things.

But you're Mr. Tony Hawk, and I'm excited for it - it's going to be good enough, yeah, I know that \"good enough\" is not going to be great, okay? But it will be good enough, and that's exciting to me. But man, oh, it looks rough; but it does look like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. It just feels weird to me that they're like, \"Oh, it's classic,\" and I'm like, \"Then why does it have a bunch of the shitty features from Thug?\" Yeah, guys, come on. Then there's Yoshi's World; it's almost unfair to compare it because that game's been out for three years, it feels like forever, and I've seen it so many damn times.

I think E3 overall the booths were really oddly set up this year like did you get too much of a chance to walk around the show floor? I walked around our show floor a fair bit West Hall South Hall, I just ran to like my appointment there. Like I thought that Sony's Booth, Sony and Nintendo and Microsoft they always kind of have a similar like layout year to year overall and they're always good it's always like well conducted to seeing all their their offerings the smaller Indie titles and the like different demo kiosks. Nintendo's very focused here was the five games you're going to play there's 10 million um stations for each one that's what you're doing Xbox is a little bit in",

Um, so I thought all that was pretty interesting. But a big thing that I don't think is being talked about enough, granted not much to talk about, Kingdom Hearts III, like we got a gameplay trailer that showed a fair amount of gameplay, a lot of new stuff, we got the new Tangled world, we saw a new Hercules place, and I'm just like, this looks awesome. I hate that that trailer ended and it said what do you remember what it said?
