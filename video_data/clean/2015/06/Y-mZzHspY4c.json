If you guys have a topic for us, go to the Kinda Funny forums at kinda funny.com/forums - there's a thread right at the top there for your Gamescast topics. There's a whole bunch of them. Shout out to Lindsay who's one of the superstars on the forums - yeah, she spells her name with an A, it's Linday (Lind L say), but she's awesome and has been super great in the forums making sure everything is beautiful and organized. Um, and she organized this topic very nicely for me. Shawn one Neo says hi guys, can I ask your opinion on the lack of light gun shooters for consoles and what the future holds? Oh yeah, this guy talked to me on Twitter about this - yeah, here's another sub-genre we don't talk about. Yeah, I mean peripheral games are just largely dead, and that's the problem - it's peripherals like that's why we don't see them. People got burned out with Guitar Hero and all that, and I think you know the PS1 era light gun games were",

I was playing with the Move getting trophies, it was like yeah this is great. All right cool but like now that the Moves are mobbed away or sold back or what the hell? My Moves are like... If you put out a light gun, I don't be down to do that, you know what I mean? Now granted again there's the argument of well my it's built into the controller but then we're just getting away from what a light gun is anyway, you know what I mean.

Yeah, I read the novelization of Resident Evil 1, I don't know why I did that, it was weird. I'll give a shout-out here to... and you're going to laugh, but stick with me, the Injustice comic book series - that was better than the story of the game, and that went on way longer; it was really an interesting Superman story, but that wasn't based on the video game, I liked it because of the characters.\"",
