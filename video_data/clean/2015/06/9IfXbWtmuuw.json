Yeah, when sitting just staring at it like a weirdo. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition - August 25th. It's the first game we all knew about that beta's out later today, so get excited about that. And then finally, Gears 4. There's no \"Avo\" - it's just Gears 4. They're pulling fast, could see much. Yeah, it was very dark, but it was pretty. It looked... yeah, yeah. Warframe five? So there you go, guys. That was it. What are your thoughts? They did a really nice job. What really continues to resonate with me is because Greg and I are unapologetically more PlayStation-centric than anything else.

But Witcher 3, which was an unknown quantity from CD Projekt, which is not a well-known studio that had never really released a game like Witcher 3 in terms of its scope and its depth and its beauty and its polish sold four million copies in two weeks. So people who still think that Fallout 4 isn't going to sell extraordinarily well and is going to kill everything around it, I think are being a little bit delusional unless you're Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed, I'd get the hell out of November okay.

Think uh no, I mean I think it's it's there's a huge upside in that you get to see and feel what the players actually care about in your game before you say that your game is done, and I think that's a massive advantage. And we've seen a lot of good Early Access games take huge advantage of that. But at the same time like having a release schedule where people know that stuff is coming, updates are coming, it's moving towards 1.0 - really.
