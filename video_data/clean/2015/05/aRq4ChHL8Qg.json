I'm going to from now on, I just heard about this today - I was listening to a podcast with Alex Winter on it, who is Bill from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure or maybe he's Ted; I don't know, I can't remember which one the guy who isn't Keanu Reeves is. He's a documentary filmmaker now, and he just did a documentary about the dark web, like the dark net, and like all this stuff in the deep web - whatever, whatever, like the place where people go to do really dark things. I heard that 95% of the internet is not Googleable; but he says if you want to access that, a lot of people use Tor, and everything you do is onioned so it's like if you go to so-and-so.onion in this browser, it takes you to that like the Deep Web where you're anonymous.

Onion in this browser it takes you to that like the Deep Web where you're like so I think we should have some sort of show with Christopher Neish, what is his name? N, I think it's NES, NES, I'm Chris, call him CK, Chher nishe, Christopher Neish because his last name is Niche. We should go to the corners of the web that are niche, you see what I did there, it's niche like two followers that I know: number one Frank Fanzo; number two Shawn Pitts, Sean Pitt - the Shan Pitts is fine; he did a walk-off with me the other day but I didn't do it back so it was just a walk-off kind of thing. So he just did a walk-off you so he won, he totally won okay. But I have to record that before I leave in uh Christopher here big on the retweets and then he has here on April 15th show me 20 seconds of Batman v Superman costumes and you have me sold and I agree with that 100%. Then more retweets including one from Col Moriarty",
