You never heard that saying before? You know what it means? I've heard it, I don't know, I don't know the...I don't have to look at this, this one I know thanks to Ryan Gettis who now works at CCP Games.

Interesting, right? Yeah, interesting. All right, here's another one - you're pulling my leg.

So today it means hang on to valuable things when getting rid of unnecessary things, but the history says during the 1500s most people bathed once a year. Even when they did bathe, the entire family used the same tub full of water. The man of the house bathed first, followed by the other males, then the females, and finally the babies.
