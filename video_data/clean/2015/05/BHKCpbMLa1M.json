I'm falling apart. Christine would murder you if your hands were that rough. Here's what I want you to do when Christine gets home: I want you to caress her arm like that and see if she yells at you because you're caressing her arm. Because, honestly, I'm terrified of Christine. Really? Why? Because uh, we had one interaction where she saw me pouring the water and she was like 'you need to refill that water' and she was dead on, and I was like...and I had a scared cat moment where I was like no, I'm just terrified of her. Good, that's what she wanted. She walked into the prison and punched the biggest guy in the face. Oh, she took me down, bro! She took me down. The rest of us haven't learned that's why Colin gives you bad toilet paper and that's why I'm going to start hiding Charmin pods.\"",

That sucks, that really sucks. My life has been very rough because I have bad constipation problems. I know who this Roy is - it's Roy Zhang. We did this last time, remember? You get to hear all my life problems. But yeah, I don't poop at other people's places because that happens every time without fail. I need to confirm that a toilet can suck everything out or else I'll be in there. That's what everyone calls me crazy because I'm always preferring to go to Starbucks. By the way, Starbucks has those toilets that are like Mega Toilets - you could flush a cat down that thing and it ain't coming back. Uh, so I like that A and B.",
