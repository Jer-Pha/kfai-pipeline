No. Oh, this is going to be a we are out in the weeds on this one. Nothing to go on, nothing to reference, dear dear Umar. Where where do we go for information about him at all? I can show you a photo of him here in a second. I gotta open up a different... I gotta do. We need something. Want to sing more Van Halen while we do this? Yeah, sure.

Jason Bourne comes back for one more fighting sequence. I don't know if any of these pictures are him; I don't think so. Is he be? I went through and I I reverse engineered his little uh email address, so I broke up what maybe that's his his last name, put it out there - wait, this is him! This is him, all right, all right! So he's got a Mirror's Edge background image on YouTube page with four subscribers. This video is amazing; Harlem Shake King's College. Well, now you know everyone knows how to find him. Are we trying to you know, trying to hide him? Well, we might put it public like we did last time, but why wouldn't he be trying to hide?
