It's actually my favorite thing because when we do our Let's Plays, Kevin just likes to paint himself into a corner where he'll bring the soundboard and the confidence monitor and our very expensive camera, and then surround himself with them, and then can't get out. He gets stuck; he squeezes past the tray table that we bought at Target for $10 that's holding the confidence monitor that's attached to the camera, which takes him an extra 15 to 20 seconds, and I'm just like Kevin, get ahead of that problem, just move the monitor over.
