Uh yes, I I think um I don't know, I mean I still think that the most resonant experience of me with VR so far is still e Valkyrie, so like you know playing being like a fighter pilot or um a space you know or in space like Star Wars Battlefront or whatever yeah I mean I think that that would be really cool. I don't know that there's like specific worlds necessarily that I want to see in VR because I feel like some of these worlds are best seen on a TV screen or in a book or in a movie, like I don't know that VR is the Cure All for immersion in every instance.

You have to go down this road multiple times to see that it's not going to work out. Yeah, and the second I want people to listen: I don't want any VR. I just don't see it as a viable future in terms of it being the definitive thing, and that's what everybody's going to do. You know what I mean? Like seeing Sony put so much behind Morpheus is a concern for me because they didn't learn from the mistakes of Move. You know what I mean? Like Oculus is a different story - Oculus is making it for a community that's already ready, and they're willing to invest all this money into their hobby, and think it's cool to",

Valkyrie or something or like what's the Sony London underwater demo that they did, it was pretty cool but like how do you make this into a game I don't know I I don't think that it's the gameplay that matters um in terms of VR's viability what matters the most is are people going to find financial reasons to make compelling games on it and that's a big thing and um will you be able to convince people to buy high-end",

And hopefully, they understand that they're going to have to spend a lot of money to get these games developed, and hope that it works out. You know, um, and I'm sure they will. They're gonna have to spend - I really think that they're gonna have to spend a couple hundred million dollars probably to like, to like get a bunch of developers on board to be like, \"We need 25 games for this thing.\" You know?
