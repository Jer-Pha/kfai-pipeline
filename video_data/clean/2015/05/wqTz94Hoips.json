There's an iPad 3, which was the same form factor as the new iPad but with a better processor or whatever, the Lightning port, and the touch thingy, sure. And now it's just called the iPad Air. Whatever, no some something about that might be a little bit wrong, but that's the general lineage. So I was looking at this new iPad, the other one is officially called the iPad Air, and I was like, \"This is cool. The screen is better. It seems like it's loading fast.\" That's what they're promoting right now. You know my old girl is getting old; she doesn't load the comics as quickly. Yeah, I mean I have some problems there and stuff like that. We're having performance issues, but they're not terrible ones though. That happens sometimes. Yeah, I know, righteous.

I don't follow tech, but this is one of those rumors that's been going on for years at this point. It's similar to the Apple Watch, where it's like we knew it was gonna come; we weren't sure when exactly okay, and every single time there's an Apple conference, you can almost telegraph what they're gonna announce and what they're gonna talk about. But every single time people are like, \"Oh, the new iPad.\" They're gonna talk about this against the octopus, and they have it. The iPad hasn't gotten a real big push for years at this point, really. Yeah, I mean it's always been like minor things.

This form-factor sucks just because with all the extra room on the sides, why was it designed that way? No Retina display come on, all that. But the processor yeah - I was gonna say the Retina display really like I thought it was a gimmick yeah until you look at the difference you're like \"whoa\" it looks like you got glasses. It's standard comics that's the big thing is I want the bigger screen because with the main thing I do with comics is pinch and zoom in on the enemy because I can't read the word bubbles and like the two-page spreads.

Um, I think the iPod itself, the success was every bit as far because of sort of the distribution as it was the actual technology like the technology was dope but let's remember like the original iPods I was like why why are people interacting with these like the pinwheel thing we have yeah remember they were buttons or what only that was easiest thing illusionary it was the wheel was revolutionary remember the original iPod what had buttons and an in that wheel and then they made it was it was very tactile The point I think the point you're making and I think that it's a salient point is just that like they've they've revolutionized things over and over again Apple revolutionized personal computing Apple revolutionized the operating system Apple revolutionized music Apple",

They don't need to do that right; we don't think they have what works and now they just want to make tweaks to make it better, and that's all I won't be different off. I don't know. I'm walking with an expectation that they're going to keep doing it like that. That's the expectation is that they're going to keep doing that, and I don't like that's why I look at the watch.

The iPad everybody was like \"I have my phone, I have my laptop, why would I need it?\" And now iPads are just everyone has one. Well, everyone being most people like anyone in our industry or that whatever, that's just like \"oh yeah, I have my iPad, I use it for reading comics or magazines or whatever very specific things.\" The watch is eventually gonna have that same thing where people use it for very specific functions up so you don't need you know I don't all need this screen but I love it right.
