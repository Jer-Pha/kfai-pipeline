I'm digging it, man. It's a game. Oh, you see what I did there? You beat me to it. It's a game called Shovel Knight. Shovel Knight came to Wii U, 3DS, and PC last year - that was 2014. Now it's available on PS3, PS4, PS Vita, and Xbox One, and you can get it in all those places. You should play it as much as you possibly can. I really love this game. I thought we would jump in since you and I have kind of an old school uh love here, so we'll create a character. Let's name him Galvatron - just for old time's sake. And then let's see... Is there something you need to say? No, I was going to say I'm excited about this game too. This is one of those games where, like, Axi and Verge, where you sort of talked about it, and I'm like, \"You know what? I'm going to take Colin's advice; I'm going to play it.\" So I've",

This game is this game is fun. now the cool thing about this game, this game is by a studio called Yacht Club - uh, odd name for a game Studio, yeah it's pretty awesome. uh, this is their first game; they kickstarted when I was at IGN, I actually exclusively revealed the game to the world and and uh people really took to it um some of the guys that are at Yacht Club used to work at WayForward - WayForward of course is known very well in the industry for making a lot of old school kind of games; one of the most recent games they made, for instance, was DuckTales remastered. right um so there's a lot of good pedigree at that studio these guys understand 8-bit games, they understand uh how to make them, how to draw them, how to make it sound like an epic",

And I play like a tank, rolling through levels, so I wanted the best yeah I wanted the best armor possible because I wanted to be able to sort of take a lot of damage. And there's one specific uh piece of armor that if you get hit by an enemy won't knock you back, and that's the thing that pisses me off most about this game - it's the only thing that annoys me, the knockback is significant, it's significant. And it's also part of the strategy right? You have to kind of be careful with what you're doing. But overall, what I was... what I find kind of fascinating about this is sort of the way you attack, like Mega Man. Oh yeah, you shouldn't have killed that guy with Mega Man.

Um, with Mega Man, you sort of had that frontal attack attack where you've got the weapon that you're shooting out, but with Shovel Knight, you kind of have to attack from above, like your actual forward uh uh shovel attack isn't very precise - you don't really get it's less for attacking more for digging up things for for the puzzle solving aspects of the game. Whereas when you kind of attack from above, that's where it becomes fun and you get that little bounce effect which is kind of a unique mechanic for me. Don't say that too often, and that and that's where I want to get into kind of The Inspirations for the game because the downward attack is so clearly inspired by Capcom's classic DuckTales, and that's and that's definitely where they got it from - the Pogo attack right, um, that is basically where everyone has seen this attack and really probably the only other place you'd",

And this is where that hit back and that knock back gets pretty annoying, you know, gets really annoying with those little guys because they're easy to destroy but there are certain levels where you just die over and over and over again because right as you jump, they move towards you and knock you back and you're like, \"God, yeah, they're aggressive.\" And this is where... we'll play a couple more stages after this so we can show people kind of more the boss stages, um, the proper night stages as it were. Um, but this is where your relics will come in. Relics are kind of your special weapons, unlike Mega Man.

Yeah, see I find the first one I got, I use constantly, the the staff, yeah, the St, it's super, it makes the game a hell of a lot easier there so we'll find that in a Shovel Knight stage um in a little while but here we find uh Black Knight um who's kind of like your persistent foil in the game more like black and red Knight me yeah cool design very cool design he's a wuss though he's he's pretty easy to beat um you fight him you know this won't",

This is really kind of taking a page more out of like Mega Man X where you can get acclimated after beating every stage, you get this really cool scene where he's at campfire and sometimes he goes into the dream... it's not every time; sometimes he just wakes up. But this is a cool Dreamscape of him kind of dreaming about a Shield Knight, and it gets progressively harder and harder.

Um, so we can go down and there's no Journey, so this is where you're going to want to be to get on the Journey. You can talk to this woman and get more magic, um, and you can talk to this guy and use meal tickets to make more food. So we'll talk to this little Ram guy down here and we'll buy... um, his meal tickets.

Oh, that's how you get up there. Do this and get the chest up here. You smart cookie! I cannot figure out how to do that, and then we'll get the money. We'll get the music sheet, and we'll go back to the world map now. We'll do two stages here. We can actually go in multiple directions.

You start playing it, the controls are great, first of all, uh, it doesn't feel clunky at all, um, it's got all those things that you love. Now this is an interesting note: should we spoil this? What do you want, what in terms of what as far as those save uh crystals, oh, that you can destroy them, yes, so yeah, here you can destroy them, you get a great deal of gold from it, but here's the deal, that's a save point that you just destroyed. So as I learned the hard way with this specific level, I was like, \"Oh, I'll just destroy all this; that's totally fine.\" But when you die...",

Yeah, they're destroyed permanently - permanently. And again, there's a trophy called \"Checkpoint List\" that makes you destroy all the checkpoints. I would not recommend it for your first uh playthrough. And the cool thing about this game too is that there's a proper New Game Plus so you beat the game, you can start new game plus which makes all the enemies twice as strong. Oh, that's cool.

If you want to make it easier on yourself, you could literally just play the first stage over and over again and level up so your life is like twice as much, you got 100% magic, and then you can go out to these bosses. There might be a little bit of grinding for that, but you know what I mean. You can make it a lot easier on yourself if you want or you can just progress quickly to the game, which I think is cool. This guy's coming up next, so King Knight's done; we'll do one more stage after this. Um, and yeah, I mean I like the Mario 3 inspiration of having this map to go to and like kind of enemies that are getting harder and harder, but at the same time uh I like the Mega Man thing too where you kind of don't know where to go and all the bosses are kind of the same; it's you need to figure out a way to get in and then go around the circle.",

This is where we were, so it really doesn't matter. Um yeah let's go. I want I want to see I want to show everyone the boss. Yeah I I actually think this is one of the cooler bosses in the game. Yeah there's a little cool kind of puzzle mechanic here with these guys and their helmets um and you have to use to like either make weight or lose weight on how you want to play it. It's just like when we used to wrestle in college right exactly right to make we're going up you had to make weight you had to I was friends with a lot of uh wrestlers uh in high school yeah you told me they would just be spitting constantly.

It gets really really complicated, not even on the stage but in like when you're fighting like in the boss stages later it gets like pretty pretty um but it's fun, it's definitely a unique kind of thing. So we're cruising our way down and over we get over here we'll use this real quick to heal ourselves get some turkey we don't have some protein see even in this game you need protein Kevin, even in gaming Kevin, you won't get enough protein.

Um, yeah see that's what I'm talking about, that knockback, yeah the knock back's bad now you use the armor that you get access to, that that eliminates the knock back for you, yes um cuz I I actually used the armor, I guess I was using it for more practical reasons with the red armor that eliminates the money that you lose or like lower the amount of money you lose, that is probably better for me cuz I tend to die a lot just cuz I a little more gun ho with oh look at you uh yeah I don't know there was that well originally I bought the gold armor cuz I was like I want to look amazing, yeah there's like no reason it's like it says in the description there's no point to this but you flip when you and",

And then he turns it dark - if you like - if he actually won't even get to this point if you kill him quickly enough. But so that's the end of Shovel Knight, so we did the intro sequence with Nick and then we did King Knight and Spectre Knight. There are six more Knights to fight, a bunch of mini bosses to fight that are like roaming enemies again, very inspired by the Hammer Bros in Mario, and then you go into kind of a last sequence, very Wyvern Castle-like thing. So um I think people are really going to enjoy the game, I highly recommend it, uh we'll get a meal ticket out of this Treasure Chest by the way, yeah we will, uh but this is another one of those games",
