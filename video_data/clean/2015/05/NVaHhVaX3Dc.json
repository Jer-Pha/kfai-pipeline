I'm here because uh when I switched out of the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night book club tier, I switched right into the Patreon tier to be on the Gamescast, and that is amazing, thank you so much; that is awesome. And also, you happy to support you guys because you were at Kinda Funny Life? Yes, that was I doubled up and made it a week-long vacation, which makes sense cuz you're now in San Francisco, California, but you are from Phoenix, Arizona. That's far away.

I was looking; it looks like you guys got a lot of new people in that tier the last few days. Awesome, and we debated frankly, like what to put, what level to put that at, and we were actually at a higher level, and then I was like well no, like let's do it at a lower level because I think that people really want it, and uh, and now they're going to get it. Yeah, it's good; I'm excited to see how that turns out because Colin Greg Miller's Live is a great show, and I wish that more people get to see it.

Oh yeah, that's remember this when we imported him from Japan and we turned him on, I'm like \"what a DAT\", yeah. And then I did Welcome Park and I got all the trophies, yeah. We're like, trophies. This brings up something very interesting to me because I feel like a lot of consoles have functions like sleep functions and like different ways to turn it on and off, and maybe I've just been doing everything wrong my entire life.

I'm like, maybe one day I'll get back to it and I'll never get back to it, but I like seeing it. The trouble with the Vita is that if you delete it, it also deletes your saves there, as opposed to like the PS3, where you can send them to PlayStation Cloud or use PlayStation Plus, but they're bundled together. There's no way to like delete the game without deleting the saves, but just delete what you know you're going to not play again and send your saves somewhere if you really care about that game.

Race the Sun is a racing game. Uh, it's a game where like you're just in like it's almost like an Wipeout type vehicle and it's just like in kind of grayscale and there's a sun setting in the background and you're trying to race towards the Sun so the sun does set so you're basically trying to keep the sun on the horizon and the lower the sun gets like the less time you have and once the sun sets the race is over.
