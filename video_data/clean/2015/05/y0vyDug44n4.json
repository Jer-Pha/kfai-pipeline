And we debated frankly, like what to put, what level to put that at, and we were actually at a higher level, and then I was like well no, like let's do it at a lower level because I think that people really want it, and uh, and now they're going to get it. Yeah, it's good; I'm excited to see how that turns out because Colin and Greg live is a great show, and I wish that more people got to see it.

And then you press it again, and it goes put to sleep; goes to sleep. It's more like a phone, then yeah, exactly. See, like you just do that. Listen to that music. God, I love that setup music. Oh, yeah, that's remember this when we imported him from Japan, and we turned him on. I'm like, \"What a DAT,\" yeah. And then I did Welcome Park, and I got all the trophies. Yeah, we're like, trophies. This brings up something very interesting to me because I feel like a lot of consoles have functions like sleep functions and like different ways to turn it on and off.

What, what I got download start a list, I'm starting a list 'cause I know you like lists; we start building what you need to get. Cod first, do you have PlayStation Plus? I do have PlayStation. Download your two free games every month, okay? Have you been doing that already? Library, I have not... uh, there are some... uh, when I first got PlayStation Plus, whenever there was a video game I was interested in, I think Limbo was on it at some point; I got that 'cause I was like, \"Hey, remember everybody: if you're gonna be a PlayStation Plus person, even if they only own a PS3 right now, always go on the online store and redeem the other games so that when you get the chance\"",

Yeah, before yeah, before you had to download it and or initiate the download and that essentially added it to your library downloaded it to your console, but now there is the add to library button where you can just click it and it adds it to the library and you can download it later at any time.

A game like Skyward Sword sold didn't sell well considering how many we've talked about this before it just didn't sell that well. I have it, I never opened it because I already put my Wii away by the time my family got it for me for Christmas exactly and it's like four or five million units or whatever for Skyward Sword with 102 million Wiis or at that point maybe 95 or 100 million Wiis it's like that's not going to cut it.

That's why the Wii sold. When I saw the Wii U numbers a couple weeks ago, I was floored; I couldn't believe it wasn't selling well, I couldn't believe it was that bad - 9.2 million units. I was like holy **** you know what I mean? Like the Dreamcast was on the market for less time and sold 1.1 million units more, and the Dreamcast is considered a huge failure. Yeah, you know I think people don't want to call the Wii U what it is because it's Nintendo, and I think that like it's not Nintendo's first failure - the Virtual Boy was a huge **** bomb too.

Like Mario Kart and Smash Brothers didn't sell Wii U; nothing else is going to sell Wii U. Zelda's not going to sell Wii U, and obviously Splatoon and all these other games are not going to sell Star Fox; they're not going to sell it. Doesn't mean that the games are bad because like you said the quality is high. The games have been as good as they've ever been. I mean Nintendo has a high-quality product; they need to patch their games, they believe in QA and a polished experience, and we all appreciate that. And other companies can learn a great deal from how Nintendo does business in that regard.

Yeah, like, what would have sold more copies of that game is if you know Capelli was on the cover with a gun, unfortunately shooting a Chimera in the head.

I, I like it's I don't know if I need that experience with other things. I mean, if I'm playing something like Civilization, I might do that, but that's not PlayStation 4, so yeah. I remember back with the original Xbox, it was a big deal that you could uh rip CDs to the Xbox and then there was certain games you could like listen to whatever music had and that was really cool, but that was part of the thing if the Spotify playlist were then actually in the games, it only works for certain like sports games would be great if I could if I could do GTA a radio station was my Spotify playlist that'd be awesome that would be awesome, but just having Spotify instead of stuff there's no game.",
