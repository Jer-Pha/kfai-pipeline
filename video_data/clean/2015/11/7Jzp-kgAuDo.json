Of course, I missed a bunch of stuff, but this year it's been annoying me that I missed Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Now what do I know about Assassin's Creed Syndicate? It's in England, old England, oi, and all that jazz. Everybody says I should have done the voices, but I'm not upset about it. And that's it really. I totally you know I do like the Assassin's Creed franchise, unlike Colin. Um, I've played pretty much not all of them; I skip some of them didn't play last year loved Black Flag, didn't play the one, didn't play three, love you know what I mean, that's how it goes. Um, but I'm excited to this one knowing nothing about it and I'm upset that I've missed it so I thought I'd play my first Assassin's Creed Syndicate.",
