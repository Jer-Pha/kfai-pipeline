Yeah, we talked about it - that was the thing it seemed that that was the rumor forever right with the rift between him and Kojima, the fight over all this stuff, y'know so on and so forth. They released Metal Gear Online four weeks ago, tops. I don't even remember it was October, right? Second week of October, and uh now they're already closing down the studio that made that part - that was the team who were like working on that game. They're gone now. They say that in their press release, of course, that now it's just moving to Japan; people are still working on this game; they'll still support it; it's still coming to PC, you know next year or whatever. It's like okay, we'll see how supported it really is and what that means.

It's always going to play out against Konami's favor, so they might be looking at being like, \"We just need to.\" There's a lot of questions about this particular situation, and it's not surprising that the LA Studio was shut down. What's surprising to me is that they've not been very good about communicating any of this stuff. I mean, saying Kojima was on vacation when the guy who broke the story is like tweeting out pictures of him at his going-away party is classic, you know? So that's the thing, and that's the whole thing - Konami's been tone deaf on this front the entire way.
