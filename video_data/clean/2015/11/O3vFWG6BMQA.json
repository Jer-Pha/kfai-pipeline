Um, but maybe they win December. But nonetheless, this is a good start for them. But from an overall evidence that I've read on NeoGAF and other places, the numbers overall for consoles were very soft. Um, it seems like Xbox One barely edged out PS4 something. Maybe Xbox one might have sold about 305,000 units in October, which is not very good. No um, but November these you know PS4 should drive over a million you assume in in November Black Friday and all this small business Sat Bund and the bundles there was no I mean Uncharted was a bundle okay Uncharted was a bundle that was of some relevance, but I think this Call of Duty in this obviously",

It gives you a little place to start something to do. I love the end of the special videos where it's like... and then it cuts off - it's like it's so cool!

I think there are pretty moments to it, but I agree there are moments of geography more than character models or locations. There are times when it swings around and I'm shooting my gun, and it doesn't slow motion; it frames it like perfectly.

And I think that if they look at CD Projekt and Techland and what they've done with these open-world games of their own, they can probably learn a thing or two. But I I don't I don't I wouldn't give Bethesda the hard time I give Telltale or something like that because these are these are complicated games and they can break in many different ways. And I I'm sure making a game like Fallout 4 is a really really daunting task. I mean, the ways you can break these games is vast, and we all break them.

I joined PSN with the launch of the PS3. I grabbed a bundle of the 60 GB Play 3 with Heavenly Sword and MotorStorm. All was fine until 2012 when my PS3 experienced the orange light of death. I called PlayStation UK to get it fixed, and they asked me for the security question to give my PSN ID. I was on a loudspeaker, and my girlfriend immediately started laughing. I didn't want to say it, so I spelled it out phonetically: Whiskey India Lima Delta Whiskey India Lima Lima Yankee 69. To which the girl on the phone replied, \"Is that Wild Wily 69?\"",
