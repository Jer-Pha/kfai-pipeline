Adam, one key score, please. Jeez. Do you have a list of everything that came out? No, I mean, we can just go through it. I'll be honest. I've lost track of everything that has come out. I try to play every big release. I try to beat every game to completion. It's hard. Yeah, that's a long road to hope. I feel like the game releases didn't start until Metal Gear Solid. Oh, wow. Does that make sense? Like, did you not play Bloodborne? I didn't play Bloodborne. Yeah, okay. If you can go down the list and like Dying Light, I beat Dying Light. Okay. What do you think of Dying Light? Better than I thought it would be. Yeah. I thought cuz I thought Dead Island was kind of a piece of **** Um I thought I liked parts of it, but",

I I thought uh cuz I thought Dead Island was kind of a piece of **** Um I thought I liked parts of it, but I thought the marketing was uh better than the game, obviously. And I I don't like weapon degradation. Yeah. On an RPG level, I liked it in Far Cry 2, but I don't like like I love the idea of like you're using a gun, it blows up on you, like, \"Oh, that's so random. That's so cool.\" But when you're just you're whacking away and the the blade is going down, I thought they did a much better job with it in Dying Light. And I thought it was fun to control. I was like, we haven't had a Mirror's Edge game in a long time. In a game that outdoes Mirror's Edge, Mirror's Edge, you know what I mean? Like open-world parkour. Exactly. It was awesome. It felt great. Yeah. I liked it a lot. Yeah. Yeah. And like most games, you ended up getting overpowered to the point where the monsters",

It got to a point where you could just sit on the ledge and kick, kick, stupid. But I ended up enjoying the game way more than I thought I would. And I thought Roger Craig Smith did a good job as the main voice. Like, it was like a really good Dead Island. So yeah. Yeah. I really liked it. Still going through my list. Yeah. Uh, Bloodborne though - that's where I ended up having to stop, just because of the same frustration I had with Dark Souls games. Where the game just keeps punishing you and punishing you, and I'm like, \"I've got to do something else at some point.\" I've got to go eat dinner, and I can't.",

Um, just the overall like once you save everyone responds and you're like 'ah' like it is stressful and it's cool but like it just sucks. I like that I have to... I don't have that much time. We'll get to it eventually. But you and I are talking about Fallout. Like what I like about Fallout is living in that world and like what I do matters. So if I do kill something that's this big guy, he's dead now in that world. You know what I see? But it also has a quick save option. So I'm an adult. I'm sorry. Did you play Idarb? IDARb. I...

It lives or dies based on the online like you know stays based on who's playing it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I feel like that's a game that would probably benefit for being like a free-to-play where if you buy the game you can play as the monster and then everyone else free to play is just like the dudes. Um never got into it. It was weird. It's just it's such a weird concept.

Have you tried to do a Vault of Glass run on Destiny and like try to organize people? There's no matchmaking so you have to like I would get on Twitter and just yell be like I need a team and people like I'm on PS4. I'm like, \"Well, I'm on Xbox.\" And they're like, \"Too bad.\" I was like, \"I couldn't get four **** people to reply to me.\" Yeah.

And that's what that's why for me I hope they the lesson they take away is to make the next whatever they make more like Left 4 Dead. Left 4 Dead was just jump in and pick up a gun and play and you don't need to have like specialized skills of what you're doing. You know what I mean? learning curve on Evolve was just it was ridiculous. Not only on an individual basis, but as a team and being able to work together. Yeah. And then maybe they should have like steps or iterations where like it started out as a very simplified version of Left 4 Dead and then it built up to what it was.

I remember Greg was playing Hot Shots on it. I was like, \"That thing looks amazing. Like this is a cool device.\" Um and then it just started collecting dust cuz I stopped using it.

Like, you're just telling me this one thing, which I would have loved if you would have just told me in the beginning it's going to be Red.
