What's up everybody, welcome to The GameOverGreggy Show, I am one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the producer slash seducer, Nick Scarpino. So that's the pure one Tim Gettys. Hi. This is of course Colin Moriarty. The other week Kevin, just a proud little papa, puts up on Instagram and Twitter that he went to the comic book store and he bought these two shirts. He got a new Superman shirt, a new Batman shirt, he wore them last week, I complimented him on them. Did I compliment you on them, Kevin? I complimented him on them and I was like, hey, nice shirts, I'm glad you got some new shirts, some new graphic design shirts, that's how you know they're from a real comic store. Today, he came late, because he had a thing and he had a change when he came back from it. He had a good excuse, somebody's dead, came back from his funeral, changed out of his suit, which you look",

And if you're a guy, you know what this looks like, you've had a t-shirt or two thousand that have fallen to this before and he claims it's not any kind of shirt. I'm not spelling the shirt. Does it smell like cum? Oh my god. Cum's got a smell. Oh it definitely does. It has a lot of things. It has a lot of things. Apparently, you know what, I'm not even going to go down that road, nevermind, let's continue with the show. I feel like it's more likely that it was donut on his back than cum, yeah.

You know how Colin sometimes, here's the thing about Colin, we make fun of him a lot for falling down and breaking shit, he actually doesn't ever break anything and or fall down. He does fall into things though. And he brushes up against things in a very aggressive, some might say violent way. Oh he brushed up against a glazed donut. I feel like he brushed up against a donut shop. He's just like, have it with him. The whole shop. Did you eat donuts at all today or yesterday? Did you have any birthday cake? No. Cupcakes, was there a cupcake at the funeral? What's the red and or brown stuff on your leg? What is wrong with you?

On that point, the thing with Kevin is everything he does is excessive and forceful. So I can only imagine how he ejaculates being the very same way. I imagine it being so intense that like, how did it get on his back is not the first question I would have. I'd be like, all right, fair enough. I can imagine that it ricochets like, Oh, Kevin. Kevin, have you ever had any cum ricochet before? Oh yeah, I mean ricochet. Yeah. Or for what? What's around? Wow. This is going to be a good show.

The week before is at 25,000. Yeah. So I'm like, we see, like you can understand why some episodes perform better than others, like based on thumbnail and headline and all this.

I mean, I like the person I'm at right now, but let's be honest. Everyone's got something that I have all sorts of regrets. You're fucking a lot. It's real life. Yeah.

But like this whole business and leaving everything is definitely like changed my perception of friendship and who my real friends are. Do you think that's the business or do you think it's because like I remember distinctly having a much active, much more active social life in my twenties, but I just don't have energy for that anymore. I still have all my friends are still there. No. I could call people up and be like, let's go into a loud bar next Saturday night and try to scream at each other.

Like when we were all like that, like the hive mind, we all had the same interests. We like, you know, Friday would end, we'd all go to the movies, the Metreon, and then Saturday we'd go drink somewhere and then we'd go do this. And you know what I mean? We'd all hang out in these groups or these clicks. It's fun to see.

No, I mean, we're super focused on what we're doing right now and that's the thing, but I don't know if that's necessarily good or bad. No, I it's definitely good.

So early in the IGN career where I was just like, I feel like getting drunk in the middle of the day. And I called Ostratag. I'm like, what are you doing? He's like, nothing.

I mean, I'm not done with it, but like, I can't imagine anything happening that would make it any worse than my teens at all. Like I remember a distinct moment when I was 19, when I was like, this is the best year of my life. Like I, it's the biggest year of my life. I got my first real girlfriend. I lost my virginity. I got my first real job. I got my driver's license in a car. Like all of those things. Yeah. Okay. Those are, I was late in a lot of things. But I was like, I, this is huge. Nothing will be bigger than that. In the past nine months alone, everything's been bigger than that. So it's like, cool. And I'm expecting much bigger things to happen in the future. So it's like 10 out of 10. How do you rate your twenties? I don't know. It depends on, it depends. It depends on where I am. Like 20, 21, 22. It's an 11 out of 10.

And when I came here in 2007, I would say it started to go down a little bit, but I mean, I professionally, everything's great. I mean, in my twenties, everything professionally was on the up and up, but you know, it's like, it's the same real talk I had with my nostalgia topic where I'm not going to sit here and like paint the rosy picture. Like I, I, there are things I regret. There are decisions I regret. There are, there's time that I wish I had back. There's, I'm never gonna get my twenties back. And, and so I think that, you know, there's been dubious, some dude, now I'm saying like a series of dubious decisions because that's not true at all, but, but a series of dubious decisions, the Colin Moriarty story",

I like decisions, but you know, I've been reflective more lately in my twenties and I'm not sure that I, I did everything that I wanted to, that I should have done the right way. I think that, you know, I stopped being as social. I used to be, you know, people look at me as like homogeneous and stuff like that, but I was, the fact of the matter is, and I think Greg and Nick know this version of me a little bit better. I used to be very social and like very not like social butterfly or bubbly, but I was like really out there.

And I think that that's, that's normal, but at the same time, like I don't, I don't like that I become more jaded. I don't like that I become a little more homogeny and like those are things I'm just very self aware of and I'm not quite sure why it happened or when it happened or how it happened. I would love to see a bubbly calling. I mean, when I was 23 or 24 years old, I was like kind of a partier and, and I don't know that you were ever bubbly. No, no, that's why I was saying I wouldn't call myself bubbly. No, but I was, I was definitely very social and like always out. I",

I've known Nick since I was like 20 years old, 21 years old. So it's, it's, it's, you know, yeah, we did, we drank a lot and that, and, and I think part of it was what Greg was saying was that that group of friends Dave and Eric and Nate and Charles are still here, but like we don't, we don't, you know, it's saying like these guys are still here, but like we were all together. And so I think we all hyped each other up and got out there. Ty and Brennan and, you know, there's a lot of just, we all came up together in some respect and I think that was part of it.

I want my thirties to be a little, I'm 31 now and I want my thirties to be a little bit different. I'm trying to like seize the bull more by the horns and make the decisions that I need to make to like make myself happy and not just keep the status quo and not just go along with the ride anymore.

The fact of the matter is, and I've told Greg this, like I have a schedule on the schedule, like just meetings that I have with my friends at night, like my, my friends, Chris and Sarah, I go to, I go to their, I go to dinner with them every other week just to make sure that we see each other and try to be more active in that way so that I can, you know, so that I can, you know, find a, so that when I'm 40 or 41 that I don't, I don't look back at my thirties and I'm like, well, another wasted",

I want to be like, you learn from your twenties and, and make things better and more productive. But that said, that's a very fucking shitty way to look at it because, you know, my twenties were also very positive in a lot of ways. I, you know, I made myself in my twenties and I'm really proud of that, you know, so it's, I don't think it's a bad way to look at it. I think it's good because all it's saying is you want those to be better. Yeah. I definitely want it to be better. Like, yeah.

So if it's like, can I do 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, or is it like, you need to be 80% good to go into heaven? I would say more good than bad. I would imagine by a, by a wide margin. This is where I think the whole Catholic purgatory argument comes into like the, like if I'm not going to purgatory, it's either heaven or hell. I don't have time, space for purgatory.

It's just an interesting conversation in the sense that I don't really believe either of these places exist. The sad thing, the scary thing about dying for me, and I am scared to die, not like the act of dying, but the feeling of being gone. Cause I really do believe it's over. Like it's done. And that's a scary thing for it to shut off. You're going to one day you will shut off and like, what is that? And, and so that's a scary thing. And so these things make you feel better.

Everything, every decision you made was already written and it's already conceived whether you're going to go to heaven or hell before you're born. And so the thought of even like saying like, oh, but, but my mind's saying to go left. So I'm gonna go right today to prove it. It's like, no, they knew you were going to have that argument and do that. Yeah. Yeah. So that's a powerless position to be. That's why I like Calvinism to me is like, I respect all religions, all sects of Christianity, whatever, but that was always a really powerless place to me.

I just find it a fascinating philosophical conversation about the different criteria we have. And we've already shown by the four of us talking about it that the criteria is not set in stone. The criteria is not even really set in stone in the Bible. So it's, it's, it's just interesting. What do you, how do you come down on the argument? Not even an argument, fear or whatever you want to say that the kingdom of heaven is here on earth right now. No, I don't, I don't buy that.

And you just sit there and let this happen to just innocent people. Like that's why that's my major problem with religion. It doesn't make any sense.

Well, the passive method, the passive God you're discussing is like more of a deist God, which is like what a lot of founders were. That's like what a lot of enlightenment thinkers believed, which is like God created and turned his back on everything. I mean, in a nutshell. But I mean, I just, it's hard for me to rectify that.
