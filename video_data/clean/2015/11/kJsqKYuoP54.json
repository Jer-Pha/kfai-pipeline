So uh, one of the things she and I were talking about, uh, that just you know, I was just thinking about after the fact was the idea of Heaven and Hell, and um, you know, she and I are not religious people, so we don't really believe in the dynamic of these places, but a lot of people do. And I was kind of curious about not necessarily where you stand now with your relig or anything - that's kind of your business, and it's not really the topic. Do you think you will go to heaven or you go to hell if you die? And maybe they exist; let's say they exist, and like what is your mental criteria, like because everyone has their criteria right.",

Like I know that for a fact, which that alone proves that I shouldn't be able to get in. Why wouldn't you get into heaven? Why wouldn't I? Yeah, I don't know. 'Cause I don't... You're showing for heaven? No. My ideas of what heaven is is is like way way way above me. I think that there's if real talk, if like heaven and hell were what we think they are, there's like three people total getting into heaven - like everyone else is **** but I'll get in there. It's like Club 33 at Disney - like one day I'll find my way in. And the thing with that is all you got to do is just go get Mike. You can get in anywhere by telling them to go get Mike.

The other side of it, of course, is like the idea of Catholic indulgences and stuff like that - like the idea that you can buy yourself into heaven. Um, which was one of the things that drove Luther to nail his thesis to the door of the church anyway. So I don't know, I just find it a fascinating philosophical conversation about the different criteria we have. And we've already shown by the four of us talking about it that the criteria is not set in stone - the criteria is not even really set in stone in the Bible. So it's it's it's just interesting. You know what do you think? How do you come down on the theory or whatever you want to say that the Kingdom of Heaven is here on Earth right now?

I mean, look what we were talking about, Col Greg live, we talked about the Syrian refugees - that's just a great example, like a war torn country, like that's that goes back and we can get into that later about why I don't think God exists because I just can't imagine a situation where it's just like let it play out, like just roll the dice and see how it plays out. You just sit there and let this stuff happen to just innocent people - that's why that's my major problem with religion doesn't make any sense.
