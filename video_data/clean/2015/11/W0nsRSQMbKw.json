King announced late Monday that it's being acquired by Activision Blizzard, the makers of popular console and PC games such as Call of Duty, for $5.9 billion dollars. King's stock price has been under pressure in part because investors are concerned that it could be a one-hit wonder or that its games might fade in popularity over time. No king is close to 500 million monthly active users, but that number has been declining and so have the company's revenues and profits. Candy Crush was first released in 2012 and quickly became one of the most popular Facebook games ever. Investors' concerns were most likely well placed since other Facebook and social games have lost their luster in the past Zinga",

Zynga was once the most dominant game maker on Facebook thanks to titles like FarmVille, but its popularity and share price faded after the social network changed its algorithm and wasn't promoting the game as much. With the buyout, Activision is able to address one of its chief areas of weakness: mobile. Activision's stock price hits an all-time high, reported today, closing up 7.5% after the King deal was made. Investors were likely responding positively to landmark news that Activision is dropping $5.9 billion to acquire a mobile publisher blah blah blah, but it also doesn't hurt that AC has a stellar third quarter that outpays analyst expectations. So just for reference, EA bought PopCap back in 2011 for $650 million; yeah, they got a steal because PopCap's making makes you",

Yeah, they got a steal because PopCap makes you know more than one game. Um, so this deal struck me as incredibly strange. Now, there's an important note to be had here: I haven't looked into it too deeply, but apparently, there are significant tax benefits to this deal. And I don't know the exact nature of that; I'll have to look at that maybe we can revisit it because I've just not had time to research it. But people have tweeted at me that there is an incredible tax benefit to this purchase that benefits Activision.

That's one in 12 people in the world are playing King games. I just don't know about that. So I don't know that doesn't sound so crazy to me though, I mean, just in the way that like everyone has access to something these things are on. But what I'm wondering is how is that number counted? Is that counted as like individual downloads of games? So if a person has five King games, are they counted five times or they're counted once? I'm just seeing that number and I'm just like that doesn't sound right; that just doesn't even sound possible. Like just that doesn't sound possible.

So the one X factor to this whole situation is like what do you know? Because it was the same question I asked when Microsoft bought Mojang, which I thought was for a lot of money, and they got away with murder with that one pretty much. EA with PopCap is like I'm sure they're looking at it being like I'm sure the guys who own PopCap are like \"You know, uh, we could probably sell for a lot more.\" Yeah, because PopCap to me is like real; I'm not saying people King aren't necessarily talented; I'm just saying that people at PopCap are Peggle and Plants vs. Zombies are already more diverse than anything that King's made, yeah, and more unique.",

You know I don't think it's so much about Candy Crush being this thing for Activision, it's more about combining the elements that make all of them work together just being this thing. How does it how does it work like in my mind I'm like how does this work if everything stays the same with King we talked about this on Colin and Greg live if everything Remains the Same with King and they keep they stay that the structure Remains the Same the games make the same amount of money and the status quo was kept which is obviously not going to happen they're going to need new games or they're going to disappear off the face.",
