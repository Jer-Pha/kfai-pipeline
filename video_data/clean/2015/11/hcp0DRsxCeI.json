I definitely can't think of any off the top of my head. The name that jumped to mind cuz it's and it's I don't it's it's a complicated question right of is anything ever perfect kind of thing but like a near-perfect gameplay loop of Metal Gear Solid, fan of MGS3, the fact that like don't get me wrong like you can get frustrated not know what you're doing da da da but the way all the systems work together like we always talk about right and the the the GMP and I want to build this and I want to play that you know what I mean the fact of like what does perfect gameplay mean I don't know but it's the perfect gameplay in the way that I want to keep playing it over and over and over again there's always",

Yeah, well, that's what I'm driving at - has on gameplay Loop, uh, in terms of gameplay, I mean it's games that have rules that are predictable and you know I think I think very deeply about about gameplay like the act of playing the game which I think is is lost on a lot of people today um and is forgiven by a lot of people. It's the reason why I think Call of Duty is so good because it's good gameplay, you know, like the game plays very very well. Um, series that come to mind, yeah Mario I think is a perfect example. I think even Super Mario Bros., The Lost Levels and 3 um have perfect near-perfect gameplay, even though the games are stiff and heavy - that is the idea so they're unforgiving.",

But I think that it it works in 2D so well because there's little else to rely on in those games to satisfy the gamer which is why I think those games are so special and why that genre is so special. And sidescrollers will never disappear because they they just really do benefit the person that wants gameplay above all else um and gameplay is absolutely king, so um that's why and and I've beaten the horse dead and why I'm so excited about Matterfall and Alienation from Housemarque is because they make perfect gameplay games like they they're they do twin stick shooters and and they are games you play.",

It's like, man, this is a really great environment; look at these environments; these people look so real, and the story is interesting, and the voice acting\u2014it's so immersive\u2014and then you move around, and it's like, oh, they nailed it; they didn't nail what matters most, which is playing the game. And uh, it's not to say every game needs to be like 34's Home, which is a game you know you might not even call it a game, and I\u2014I don't\u2014I don't maybe you shouldn't call it a video game; I don't know\u2014it's a Choose Your Own Adventure game.

It wasn't the way the game looked or the way the game sounded or the story; it was the way the game played. Um, so man, gameplay is we we must have lost sight of the fact that gameplay is just very very important, and can modern games nail it? Yes, and do they... yeah. Um, but look at the games we love, like Fallout 3 - V.A.T.S. is there because the game sucks at gameplay, yeah, like like V.A.T.S. is an excuse for not being able to have first-person shooter controls, and and we let it go because everything else around it's so good, but is the gameplay good in Fallout three?

I don't think the mechanics are good at all, and that's when I'm talking about for RPG mechanics, I'm talking about leveling up, you know, skill points stuff. Yeah, it's great. But like, Fallout 1 and Fallout 3 in New Vegas... I adore those games, but man, they're like not good if you just played them in a vacuum. If you're just like, if you made Fallout 3 if you removed all the elements, all the story, and made it like a corridor shooter, like Killzone for instance, and they play it, no, it would be awful, be awful, you know.

It was a perfect fusion, much like maybe even Crisis one was another example of that - a competent shooter in an open world. I really liked the original Crisis for that same reason. So, I don't know... We can go on. I love talking about gameplay, man. Yeah, like I love talking about mechanics and uh, oh, go play R-Type.

They don't need there's no reason for them to get into the manufacturing of hardware; they can just sit there and keep making Steam and make money hand over fist and never have to make Half-Life Episode Three. But if they would have done it, they were the people to do it and show it and make everyone believe in it, and they didn't. They left it open, and that's why nobody has a Steam box; nobody cares if it is going to happen now or in the near future. No, is it going to happen at some point? It's a far conclusion - it's going to happen, in my opinion. So I, I disagree with Greg, and certainly saying like no at all. I think it's inevitable, it's totally...
