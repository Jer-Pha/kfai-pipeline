I love Mitch Dyer; he's a good dude. So the article was entitled \"Halo 5 Ads Lied to You.\" Okay, yeah, I know this one. Okay, this guy kicked around everyone started talking about what the game so here's my thing: I want to talk about the article but I also want to talk about how ridiculous people's reaction to the article is sure cuz I just don't understand the kind of reactions that it got where vicious uproar. My uproar was not vicious; I did not tweet, I did not yell, I did not scream. I saw it and then I saw people discuss you know like I saw the headline, I saw people reacting to it that the ads lied to you and da d da and I was like oh that sucks cuz I hadn't started it yet, I haven't jumped in, I don't know what the story is going to be and the story I have set up is lock first Chief that's the thing and so for this to be like it all",

But the ads got me hyped based on the story, you know what I mean if that makes sense. So then knowing that that's not really what it was like, oh, I don't know how I feel about that. Yeah, but I mean here's my thing: that's not Mitch Dyer's fault. No, you know well, I'm not mad at Mitch okay. Well then, but what I'm saying is a lot of people are... Oh, people are mad about and that's the other thing is like people are acting like IGN is trying to be biased against Xbox, and this whole thing is like a **** on Halo thing.

You know, I think that's entirely different, and it's a very valid thing to talk about. And in terms of spoilers, yeah, spoiling what's not in the game is spoiling the game, but if you're being lied to, this stuff should be presented to you right? Okay, well read the story, what's the what I I cuz I didn't click on you know I mean I played Halo last night and now I'm into it, but I still haven't gotten to where the story falls apart in 180s. It's not so this is it's it's a long article, I'm going to just read read excerpts here, I'm I'm do spoilers here, but they're spoiling just what's not in the game, so if you don't want to hear that, no touching prepare yourself, no touching.

Both scenes end with the implied execution in a ravaged city, whose last standing structure is a monument to Master Chief above the Infinity, where the sky is smoldering, possibly singeing towards the planet's surface. None of this happens in Halo 5, not even close. And then they go through this whole two sides of the story and how like just a lot of that stuff is just not what it seems at all. Okay, see? And then I think it's just a bad headline. When I saw the headline, I assumed what we had seen leading up to this was not the story I was assuming we were getting a Batman: Origins style twist where I thought spoilers for Batman or Batman: Arkham Origin, I thought yeah you're about to go play it when you get home, Kevin. I thought we were going through and we're getting this Black Mask story right but really quick into that game it's like",

Are they promising that what you're buying has this thing in it? Sure, you know. And it's like when you watch a Halo 5 movie trailer - I mean, Mitch even makes this point nowadays gives away the whole movie, sure. So it's like would you rather that or would you rather them kind of tease you with the stuff that's just not in the game right? You know. And some things are just like in terms of thematic stuff, it makes sense. Where I didn't really expect the scenes of Master Chief killing each other to be in that game. How would that happen? I didn't expect the scene of Chief walking alone in the desert in his poncho to be in the game, but see.",

You've had how like I'm having the exact opposite where we watched the trailer launch trailer and I was like this is getting me hyped and then last night we're doing the thing where we're falling through the sky and the Muse song should be playing but it isn't I'm like all right yeah I remember this all right cool let's go shoot some **** you know what I mean like I I mean games.",

I would love to not know anything going into it because I knew I was going to play Halo with Christine right, like I know I'm going to play Uncharted. Uh, I don't think they need to be deceptive, don't show me something like you're fighting 80-story tall enemies right and then you get in the game, you're always just fighting grunts or something, you know what I mean. Like if it's one for one, but then again, I'm still speaking to something I didn't see and don't understand, but movies do it all the time where they show you not so much anymore, I guess, but in the old days, I remember Varsity Blues in particular that you watch the trailers for Varsity",

Like, I think if the original thing had shown more of that team element stuff, then this wouldn't be such a problem, a lie you know. It'd be more like, just getting more into the marketing stuff was just more for you to enjoy, you know. And like, that's like the Forer's movies when they first announced them and stuff - all the trailers weren't even the movies at all. That was the point though, it was just like getting people hyped for whatever ended up disappointing everyone but like, at least the marketing was it was marketing you know, it was just get hyped for this thing and how long ago was the Dual Execution Lone Wolf trailer thing - less than a year?

Yeah, but when you're trying to come up with a punchy headline that attracts people, you mean that's really what it is.
