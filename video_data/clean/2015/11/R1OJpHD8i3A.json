It's like conclusively leaked that, like, a month ago; I was making entertaining shows where Tim and I argue about things, and I'll buy a burrito anytime - it's not like I bet him $100 bucks; I wasn't like I was like \"it's going to happen,\" but so you make bets just to make them. Your bets don't mean anything; people get engaged, they talk about it, then on Twitter, and they tweeted us about it. I thought it was a dumb move, so...

But I will say that watching the HD trailer, I was excited because I knew this was coming. I want a burrito off of it, damn it!

They might do something more similar to Smash Bros on the 3DS and Wii U, where it's the same game but there's more stuff on the NX one, and that's going to make people want to buy it either again or wait and buy that version. Yeah, I think I just don't believe that NX is going to come out next year simply because it doesn't seem it seemed so back in like between the NES and SNES transition in '91, NES was still like really viable actually for a long time. I mean they were releasing first party Nintendo games in 1994. Um, so it was it was different then. SNES and N64 was a little more tapered.

Um, but it it shows that you know people were desperate for Cloud and for Crash um, and they just got Cloud in in I wouldn't even say the competitor, it's just the game that inspired all All-Stars in a way, so I I think at the very least this is an shot at Sony to get one of their characters, a character. I mean there's there's really few characters that are more closely associated with PlayStation's history than Cloud um, but again the conspiracy theorist in me kind of thinks that this means more than just uh than just getting and I don't know if it's I don't know that it's the the Final Fantasy VII remake necessarily because as far as I understand that is a",

I think what people are reacting to is Dying Light and The Witcher 3, which are these gigantic next-gen open world games that just look and run way way way better and they're no less ambitious than Fallout. And I think that's the problem - that's why I said in our review discussion Fallout 4 is the epitome of a game that was made in a vacuum. This is a game that has been under development since before Skyrim came out, so this is a game that was in development since at least 2011 if not 2010. So it's just the nature of the way the game was developed and I don't... I'm sure but that's they're not stupid, they know that they they're they're sacrificing one thing for the other.

I do think it doesn't look good aesthetically next to The Witcher 3, which is really just as big and maybe even more ambitious in some ways. And so I understand why people are upset about that. That's why I'm so impressed with the way CD Projekt RED (not \"right\") and Techland really came out of nowhere and are making games on Bethesda's level. Because when Fallout 3 came out, no one was making games like that; like no one was really really really making games like that except for Bethesda - whether it was Morrowind or Oblivion or Fallout 3 or Skyrim. I mean these were kind of uniquely Bethesda games. But now there's it's not to say no one was making open world RPGs or anything like that.
