Yeah, I don't know; I still don't know why we have two of them actually. It's because a long time ago Christine moved in with me and fell in love with the Dyson. Then we broke up, and we're like, \"We'll never be back together.\" And then we got back together, and she had already bought another Dyson. So now we've got two goddamn Dysons in the house. I'll take a Dyson off your hands if you're trying to get rid of one; you give me some money though. I'll give you some money, really? Yeah, we'll talk about this after.

He's done some crazy stuff, but I think he's had these amazing moments of clarity where he's like \"I am a crazy person, a crazy personality, rather than a person,\" and I should just run with it. And apparently, I mean, I've seen him in interviews in which he's very introspective and very contrite, and says, \"Oh my God, I really did some really bad things. I'm taking medication; I'm okay.\" Then I heard him on an interview \u2013 pardon me \u2013 I heard him on an interview a couple of months back with some sports guy who was in the UK because he was doing his two what you'd and he said, \"So has it been difficult for you as you did go to federal prison on a rape charge?\" And Mike just lost it, yeah.
