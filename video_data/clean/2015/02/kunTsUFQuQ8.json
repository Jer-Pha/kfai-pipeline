You made a prediction on Kinda Funny Games caps that Fallout 4 is coming this year. Yeah. It's getting announced this year. It's getting released this year. Yep. Today. Bethesda announces they're doing an E3 press conference, June 14th, that's all they said, it's in Hollywood. How do you feel about your prediction right now? Oh, it's the announcement part anyway is a lock at this point. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The bigger question is not about Fallout 4, because I think it's obvious. I think what the bigger question is, is when will Fallout 4 come out? I still think it will come out this year. Why do you think that? Because I don't think that this is one of those few let me back up. We talk about a game like Half-Life 3 right? Our good friend Charles used to say",

            "text": "those few, let me back up. We talk about a game like Half-Life 3 right? Our good friend Greg would say something about Half-Life 3 which was really interesting. He would say that Valve could release the game and not say anything about it and put it up, and that would be one of the few games that would be fine. People would freak, freak the fuck out. Yeah. Like, they're like, the game's done and here it is. Yeah yeah yeah. You know? And I kind of feel like Bethesda with Fallout 4 is one of those studios and one of those games where they you do something not, maybe not, as, as similar but like, Fallout 4 is real, we'll have one event where people play it and see it and that's it. Yeah. Because that game's going to have so much hype, and it has so much hype for not even being announced yet. Sure. And will sell. Exorbitant, eight, nine, ten, 12 million copies probably at least. Yeah.",

In fact, it would hurt them to announce the game and stretch it out over an 18 month period. Sure. Because then people will start picking it apart. Right, right, right, right, right. So I think that Fallout 4 being announced at this thing is, is obvious. I think the bigger question is. What is MachineGames doing? What is Tango Gameworks gonna make Evil Within again? What is id Software doing? You're talking about the rest of Bethesda's calendar. Right, exactly. This isn't we're doing an event, a 15 minute presentation. Right. This is that we're doing our own press conference, which means, as you know, from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo and. We have a lot to say. Right. We're not talking about one game. We're talking about many games. Right. I mean, you would assume that, right? Yeah.",

I mean, maybe they are gonna say, like, Fallout 4 is such a big deal, and it is, that we are gonna focus for half an hour, 45 minutes, on Fallout 4. Maybe that's possible. Yeah. But. I don't, again, I don't think that's, I don't think that's gonna happen. What is Arkane doing? It seems like they're working on Dishonored 2, I mean, that's been the rumor for a long time. Maybe we see Dishonored 2. What is Doom? id Software has been working on Doom 4 for a long time, Yeah. and so maybe you see that there. Everyone forgets that Bethesda owns a bunch of studios, Yeah. you know, like they have. Bethesda Game Studios which is, you know, Todd Howard, and those guys that do Elder Scrolls and Fallout, but they have like, four or five other studios",

So, you know, what, you know, are they gonna announce an Evil Within sequel? I'm sure I won't be ready for years, but Evil Within sold much better than I think people thought - Sure. It was gonna be. It, it, it was much better a game. So, are they gonna, you know, have an association with my comedy and do a sequel to that? Yeah. What's going on with Prey 2? Prey 2 was anarchy and it was canceled. I was at an event years ago with Nick Scarpino where we saw Prey 2 being played. The game was, there was at least a chunk of the game done. Right. It looked very cool. Are they gonna revive that game? Apparently they had a lot of problems in development, it went to development hell. Questions for you",

Questions for you Yeah. And the fans in the audience, I'm sure. Too early to hear something about a new Wolfenstein? And then what about something from Elder Scrolls? Do they focus more on like an expansion for the MMO? Do they mention they're going to do something, you know, on its own with an RPG, Skyrim 2, whatever? So Machine Games owns Machine Games. Machine Games has only made one game, Wolfenstein: The New Order. They're definitely going to make a sequel to that. You have to assume that the engine's done. That game, again better than people thought it was going to be again did better than people thought it was going to do. That game was actually a fan favorite for some people last year. Sure. Except the opening. Um yeah the opening",

Um, yeah, the opening was fucking awful. But it would be weird for them not to make another game; I don't think it's ready this year or even next year. But certainly they're going to make another. Do you think all of the things we are talking about is, Of course they are going to make a game; maybe it's not ready. Do you think they'll go the EA route from E3 last year? Do a bunch of videos like, this is what the Mass Effect team is working on. There's no announcement, the game is not done, there's nothing to show you. I hope they don't do that because that was stupid. Because that got people. I thought that was really dumb. Yeah. You know, here's an ad and we're working on Battlefield. See you in four years; like, who the hell",

That's exactly what you don't wanna do. Ok. You know, I mean, in my opinion. You wanna stoke these fires forever and ever and ever and ever and ever. Yeah, like, and that's why it'd be such a brilliant play to be like Fallout 4, here's Fallout 4. In August, in June, Fallout 4 is here. It takes place in Massachusetts, which it probably does. The, the, you know, this is the logo. Here's a little bit of gameplay. In August, they're like, we have press, and we're gonna play it for a few hours. And then in November. November, here's the game. You know. Would be awesome. Because remember, Skyrim came out a long time ago, and Skyrim was a Todd Howard game, obviously The Elder Scrolls: New Vegas was made by Obsidian, so that brings up an interesting question,",

I think that it's possible that The Elder Scrolls 6, or a significant expansion or side story might be under development at another studio. Kind of similar to what Obsidian did with New Vegas. So, I don't think it's , I think their hands are pretty full right now. But I think that would be an exciting you know premise too. Because again we're not gonna get The Elder Scrolls 6 or a Skyrim style Elder Scrolls game for a very long time.Mm hm.Considering how long these guys put into Fallout.Sure.So, I think this is really exciting, because this is an awesome publisher. They have a huge catalogue of games, and a great studio. id Software is obviously a shell of its former self",

They have a huge catalogue of games, and a great studio. id Software is obviously a shell of its former self, but it's still a great studio. Yeah. MachineGames showed a lot of promise for its first game. And again they, you know, Machine Games obviously has ten year olds and, and other shooter studios have a lot of talent there for most studios too. Arc System Works obviously speaks for itself. They opened a new Arc System Works studio. So I don't know, this is exciting. And I don't think it's going to be all about Fallout. I think Fallout is going to be the last game they talk about. Yah, it'll be the best game they talk about. So, so concrete predictions. Dishonored 2. Yah. For sure, I think Dishonored 2 is going to be there. Lock of the week. I think obviously, yah we'll see Fallout 4. And then I think, you know, you'll see",

And you'll probably see, you know, a, a game maybe a new IP, or something like that. So probably like four games. But there's a lot of possibilities. People just forget. But . So I think those are, there's good reason to be excited about those other games. Well, ladies and gentlemen, are you excited about this year Bethesda E3 event?
