The user named Community had a thread there, everybody should go join the Kinda Funny community thread, fancy uh by user Shinobi 602. So the thread title was E3 2015 predictions and I was like all right, I'm going to click on this. I was wondering what it was, I thought was just going to be like one sentence and then a bunch of people saying stuff but this guy actually made a bunch of predictions for each of the press conferences and then third party - so okay Ubisoft got its own, Bethesda got its own, Activision or you whatever, but um then the rest is just third party and there's like a fair amount of predictions in here. So I kind of want to just go through and just talk about the likelihood... I like it, I like it, it's it's a game of I doubted I guarantee it, there you go, and a little bit of Colin was right might be thrown in there. Oh really? No we'll see. Oh you're just trying to steal my Swagger let's start.",

Yes it's time. Oh I hope so, I guess I'm gonna say I hope so. In there it's time, a lot of things are time Colin has been saying it's time for a lot of things to happen that don't happen. That game's been gestating for so long you know like you got to show it now. You reported that like I want to say like literally four years ago you know like yeah yeah yeah don't forget about I mean a lot of things just get cancelled for a long time.
