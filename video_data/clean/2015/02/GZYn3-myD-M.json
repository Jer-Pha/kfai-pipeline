We go at that thing that's a that's actually was the inspiration for the movie Tremors, Kevin Bacon, that's what I heard. I heard they were a big Sculptured Software fan, they were like you know what, you know what knocked it out of the park in that game, the Tremor that came up, the little earthworm, let's make an entire movie about that great film if you've never seen it, fantastic. You know what's funnier about this game than anything to me Nick though is the um is the nature of the publishing uh of the game so obviously Lucas and Sculptured had made the game JEDI OUTCAST yeah you were mentioning that on Games the game what they published the so I assume they then had a media division that was doing this",

Um but you got a chance to you felt like you were in the movie but you also got a chance to like explore those areas or you know the moments in the movie that would have been 5 minutes that are now an entire stage which is cool, like we're going to go into that Sand Crawler in a few minutes yeah and I think that see what that looks like and I think that that's what's so special about video games like this especially video games in an era where um we simply weren't as you were saying like we don't get to see everything we dreamed about, like what what's going on in Tatooine other than you know this is a live vibrant Planet so like what",

Where'd you get those boots? It wants you to go up; I am going up. I don't think you go up there; you go where'd you get that kick flip is that a double jump of some sort? This reminds me of Contra a little bit. Oh God, Contra we got to play that at some point; we got a speedrun Contra. I'm pretty sure we could beat it in like 15-20 minutes. Can I jump?

This is like borderline Jawa genocide. Yeah, I mean let's be honest about it. I mean how many Jawas are there really in the world? This could be all that we have.

No, I mean, it's like it's one of those games where you kind of just have to deal with it. I love how there's like no invincibility either, so like when you get hit, it's just... what I'm saying, there's like no real advantage to getting hit. You know, like Mega Man; for there's an advantage to getting hit, you can use it as part of your strategy, as we've shown in our other Let's Plays.
