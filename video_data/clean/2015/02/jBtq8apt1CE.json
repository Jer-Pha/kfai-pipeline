Right now is that people lose sight of the fact that it's the best time to be alive for this hobby because if you're at least from a consumer standpoint right. Because at any point you can say, \"Oh man, Greg and Colin like PlayStation too much.\" They're not; they're not the voice for me. I'm going to go look at ScrewAttack. I'm going to go look at Jim Sterling. I'm going to go look at Kaeo Milgate. I'm going to look at Game Informer. There are so many voices out there that you can literally boil it down to the three people that you feel speak to you the most, and then go to them over and over again to find what happens. The problem is when people look at one site only one site IGN and don't realize that multiple people review games on that. So then it becomes IGN gave this game this score, but they also gave Uncharted a 10, but they also gave Uncharted 2 a 10, but they also gave this a 10 so",

I think review scores and star systems matter; I think the written word matters, and I love the fact that there's different sites doing different things with it. I always say, \"Like, you know people always ask us, 'What do I do?' I always say, well, start doing it.\" But my other thing is, don't try to compete with IGN at any point. Don't want to know what idiot Gamers over on Kinda Funny Games gave out of 10 to this game; like that doesn't matter. You stand out because you are you. What do you think about this game?

It's like, \"what does that mean?\" And how do you put that into a Metacritic score? And it was like, \"a whole what-do-you-mean-to-England\" who doesn't use the A-through-F mentality for scores exactly. So, like, to me, I think reviewing products is important, but I think we have to rely on the written or spoken word; I don't think we have to reduce it into bullet points and scores. I think that's stupid, and I think people want more than that. I don't... I know some people like to scroll down and look at the scores, but I think the people who really care about the content of a game and the quality or lack thereof of a game or talking about a game in a substantive way want to read about it, and then they want to",

But I prefer to do that for three or four people in the industry, and then when it does boil down to though, I want to know what's happening in a wide-ranging thing. I'm never going to go and read Blank.com giant review. I'd rather scroll down and see what they gave it and say oh well, A gave it this that and this person gave it, and have that as part of the consensus as well, even though that number doesn't matter to me as much as the person I it does.

And I think that it's about identifying the people you trust like Greg was saying but also I think that you know to me it's it's weird to take something sub totally subjective like a review and then put a number on it which is as definitive a way to communicate as we have you know as humans, like a number you know like a definitive nine eight, like this means something.
