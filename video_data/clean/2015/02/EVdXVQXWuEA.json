I'm Greg, that's Tim Gettys, that's Nick Scarpino, that's Colin Moriarty, and that's Portillo, and we're back to play more #IDARB. Guys, we had a lot of fun with this #IDARB. Yeah, great game, was surprisingly fun. We didn't have enough controllers, though, so we did one-on-one. Right. Now, Microsoft sent us a bunch of controllers. We're, Xbox is helping us. Thank you, Microsoft. Get ready to actually do this. This. Yes, that was awesome. On top of that, a man named Fab made Kinda Funny characters for us. Ooh! But I believe only one team can be Kinda Funny. That's fine. I'm gonna be Teddy Roosevelt. All right, you're the Presidents, then. It doesn't really matter to us. We'll be Kinda Funny. We're together? All right. So that's how we're gonna do it. All right.",
