If you just heard scratching that was because Colin was scratching his crotch. Sorry. He's got something on there. I have a little ketchup from my lunch, which is eggs and rice. It's happily placed right on top of your...penis. That's a good place. That's one of my favorite places in the entire world. I forgot we're not doing the GoG show. Oh, it doesn't matter. Okay. It's fun. Okay. Anyway, yeah, so he wants to do that. Yeah, well is it news? Well, exactly. So far, he's attached open-world elements, don't get me wrong, you know I love Kojima, I'm not...I love him",

But in 2013 he made this announcement. He'd love another studio to work on it. In 2014 he talked about it again. Now, in 2015 here he is and all he's done is added Open World to it. Well, I think that's a, to me that's the biggest issue with this because I want him to do this. What's the big, what's the biggest issue? I, I definitely want a remake of one. Yeah. We already got it with Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes. His idea. And it was amazing. I really liked Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes. I loved Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes.

Jesus, yes. Be a great play through for a lot of people that haven't played Metal Gear One. Somehow. But. You're all monsters. This open world idea. That's me. What the hell? That's what doesn't make sense to me. So, all right, MGS 5 is open world, cool. That's gonna be a new experience and stuff. You can't make Metal Gear Solid 1 open world.

I mean, I, I agree with Tim. I, it doesn't make any sense. Unless, unless the game's totally rewritten. Because the idea, it's great that you brought up Resident Evil. Very astute, I think, because it, does remind me of the mansion in Resident Evil or the sh, or Ishimura in Dead Space.

Nobody's biting on this, so now he's trying to spruce up the deal. It's like when you're trying to sell your- It's like when you're trying to sell your friend Tim Gettys a vacuum. Uh-huh.

You don't do them in the other. No, because I feel like you're getting more weapons and new weapons and different things. Like, the game works with a certain rhythm that I don't think works. I actually think Big Shell would be an easier place to do an open, like an open worldish game if you had multiple. Shells. But even then, it would rewrite the game itself. Like, Metal Gear games aren't open world until four, or until five. Potentially, but I mean, aren't you. Open world is such a misleading term, because you are working your way through a linear story.
