It's got to be, it's a special list. Oh, we're going to do a Moonwalker let's play, that'll be something special. We should do that. But all right, so Grand Theft Auto 5 is now the second most-selling game of all time really? That's nuts! Like, that means it's sold more than Mario Bros. Mario Bros., wait, is it the highest-grossing or highest-selling? Sold the most units, okay? So it literally made the most money, yeah. So okay Colin you have a little more information on this because you know your stuff and can talk about numbers and all right so Grand Theft Auto 5 take two is the",

So Grand Theft Auto V is the publisher that owns you know a lot of different publishing brands, but ultimately publishes Grand Theft Auto, even though Rockstar's it own company or whatever. So they announced that 45 million copies of Grand Theft Auto V have been shipped in, shipped in, of course means shipped to retailers, not sold to consumers. It doesn't matter; people get hung up on this all the time. They don't ship copies to games that are not going to be sold to consumers; they're not stupid. So this is essentially a projected will hit this number, and it's 45 million. Um, can't they ship the games back though? Don't is not how retailers work if they don't sell a specific amount of units, they actually ship them back. They do it with comments. No, have you seen all that like random Cory in the House That's So Raven GBA games.",

The crazy thing about this is make assumptions about certain console sales numbers - right, about 80 million PS3s, about 80 million Xbox 360s, that's 160 million units, about 20 million PS4s, and about 10 million Xbox One. So that's about 190 million units of consoles that means the attach rate of these games are one in four across all the platforms it's available on - the game's not available on PC yet which is incredible.

They still must be making money off of the last one that came out. Oh, I'm sure. And then the crazy thing is that the last one only sold about 25 million copies. And I say only, but like this, this what's incredible is that the install base like it's just so funny like the Grand Theft Auto IV numbers count. The PC version which hasn't come out yet for Grand Theft Auto V, that's even crazier because when that comes out, that's going to sell another 10 or 15 million copies because people love modding those games. So this game is going to pass the 50 million mark at least, which is totally nuts when you consider that that game cost $60 each. Like they are just printing money.

Because Rockstar has multiple studios - one of them is obviously working on Red Dead, that you know, Rockstar North does Grand Theft Auto, Rockstar San Diego is probably doing Red Dead. They have all their different studios like they are an studio with thousands of people working on their games. They could take the Call of Duty model and be like, \"We're gonna make a Grand Theft Auto game every year.\" You know, and that's what we're going to do - we're going to **** run this guy into the ground, you know. And they'll sell 15-20-25 million of that game a year. They don't, and what's brilliant is that they make more money by not doing that because the development cycle isn't so crazy that they have to do the Activision thing where like everyone in the Activision family works on Call of Duty now.",

That's the funny thing is they can just take a studio like Sledgehammer instead of every other studio that they own and be like, \"You guys work on Call of Duty and that's it,\" and everyone else is going to do their own thing - and that's what Rockstar does, you know? Because Rockstar if they wanted to make a Grand Theft Auto game every year, they could reskin, go back to Liberty City or whatever, but then it would cost more and more and more money, and their profit margins would go down.

I mean and that's the and that's the the crazier I think through line about the like what uh cultural phenomenon equals to a game that just sells well, it's just quietly good. And I'm not saying Grand Theft Auto V is quietly good, obviously they had a lot of ad campaigns, people love that game, they play the **** out of it, they're obsessed with it but for 45 million sales worth it is very quiet cuz it's a it's a no-brainer at this point.

But I mean, like, look at the numbers they just did; like why not do the exact same thing in bookend? You know, do they're going to see how well they did here so put out GTA 6 right at the end of the PS4's life cycle and then put it over to... it's a valid point. We'll see what happens. I hope their stewardship of the series is going to be very important moving forward because, well, because they like they have to remember that the quality of the game speaks for itself. I feel the same way about Call of Duty; actually, I think those games are very high-quality um even though they make them every year, I think they're of a high quality um but don't run it in the ground \u2013 your trajectory is going up, Call of Duties is going down, you know what I mean?

Well, we could talk about this forever and I feel like we should have another topic, a follow-up topic soon where we actually just go through all of the best-selling games and all the different consoles and see because I feel like there's going to be a couple surprises in there. We didn't have time to do it here because we just kept talking about GTA because GTA is that damn good. There's a great list on Wikipedia, just a great list, and they're cited. Nintendo does a really great job, especially about updating sales of historic software too, which I think is really cool. And so yeah, if you dive in, they even separate them on this page by console, which I think is fun. So yeah, we can definitely, we definitely can and should I think dive into that in the future. Anyways, until next week, please give us some five stars on iTunes, please leave some comments below about all your thoughts on all the different things we talked about.\"",
