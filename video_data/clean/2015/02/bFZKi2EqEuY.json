It is not. It is a hardcore RPG with resource management, and it is like... and Greg totally lied to me, so I am like, I am like seven or eight hours into this game, and I only 10% through the story of it, and it is crushing me because it gets really hard really fast.

I think it's somewhat of a role-playing game, there's statistics in it, there is resource management in it, uh it is it is a fairly complicated game. Um, there's ways to trick the system which I've discovered, the molotov cocktail is for me, we got throw them on things on bad guys if you can like stand on a car for instance a van or a bus and get like eight nine ten fifteen of those guys around just launch one in there you get like so many experience points yeah and all you need is string and alcohol to make the molotov cocktail made a couple.",

Still no, no, there's a few of those, but this is one of those where you go all the way out toward the bridge and it's like he uh, rise sends you out to like basically extort money from people.

They had problems at Dead Island too where they just don't know or they just don't code properly progression attached to Trophies.

The big problem, and what sucks for these kinds of games is if you for instance get all the side quests and don't pop the trophy.

It's a great game, it's an influential game, right? Place right time, 1994, Super Nintendo, kind of a late game, um we were waiting since super you know since Metroid II and Game Boy to get another continuation of Samus and her story and uh so it was delivered. Um but the gameplay is rigid in that game and and frankly I went back and played on my DS my 3DS uh Metroid the original Metroid which is a game I love um that game is hard as hell and I I was I was actually joking around I'm like I don't remember being this bad at this game um when I was a kid but in that g in that game too the gameplay is rigid, the beautiful thing about playing as Alucard in Castlevania or Maria in Castlevania if",

Because unless you're into like Compile Heart games or Idea Factory or these random Japanese role-playing uh studios which a lot of people aren't, Spike Chunsoft or whatever which make Danganronpa which is in a role-playing game but then you really don't have much to play with the exception of Tales and I think Tales is the only Japanese role-playing series right now that comes out almost on a yearly basis.",

Yeah, let's back up for a second because you guys keep saying this like I have any point of reference on this whatsoever, talk to me like I'm a three-year-old that's never played a game before what is Persona? So Persona is a Japanese role-playing series that began on PS1, um, and it's by Atlus - so the team is now owned by Sega but the Persona team is the developer that makes these. Their internal developer; they also made Catherine. So, uh, is it like Catherine? Is that visual same visual style or does it look like it now?

I often wonder if this 12-month lead time that we go with a lot of games doesn't hurt some games and that they don't need to do that. And I think we said we called out Chucklefish's statement about Half-Life 3, which always stuck with me, which is that Half-Life 3 is one of those games where they can announce it the day it comes out and it won't affect anything, yeah, you know, they'll sell millions of copies of that game because people are just crazy about it, and Steam or Valve is crazy enough to do it, where they'll be like, \"Hey, Half-Life 3, we're ready to talk about it; it's out.\"",

Um, so if an American-owned company like Microsoft is going to scrutinize their American product that much, how is you know a seemingly that far removed company like Nintendo, that's sitting in Japan, and they're making these decisions, that that as a westernized audience we're like, \"That's a little off from what we would expect.\" Um, I just I don't see that working, and I see that I see that more likely dying on the vine exactly. But this is obviously a very different time, but the Zelda cartoon happened, how the **** that happened? Yeah, it's true.

And Nintendo of America doesn't seem to have much power, so for this to work for a western audience as well as an Eastern audience, which isn't so different when you're consuming TV and movies or really any other kind of entertainment, they have to give the power, as you said, to the producer and the director, and Netflix.
