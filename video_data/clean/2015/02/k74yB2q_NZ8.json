For Tim loved his princesses; each was cherished and dear. He couldn't give up on any, so the solution was clear. But no such behavior gets left unchecked. The princesses found out, and boy did he get what's coming to him. He's a cheating bastard! Baby, baby! This is not what it looks like, no, no, no! I love you; I love all of you, you dick! Wait a sec, hi Tiger Baba's just left for work, and the kids are at school. Why don't you come on over? Now's not a good time. Get him totally deleting you from Facebook. A bruised ego, a black eye, and more than one broken bone. He left the land of princesses to live out his days alone. There is no silver lining to this story or aid that is sunny. What such a sad ending for Tim? At least it was kind of funny, but when it's over, Love Goes On.",
