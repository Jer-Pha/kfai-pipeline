This game never made a lot of sense to me; it got really, really hard, really quickly, and I didn't get through it. So this is fun because now that we've formed this bond of friendship, I get to actually feel like I'm beating the game; we're not actually having to go through the nerves I mean you can ID of doing it, you can take credit for it. You know, I'm not gonna lie, a stock can I just... can you hide the controller and I'll pretend like sure I can do that though? Yeah, but I think you know one of the special things about this game; I think it's just... I don't know, I just think that the visual flair of the game is just really, really special.

So let's see... at least up that's the boomerang we can actually grab it now. We don't so here's my thing: so you can only have one unlike Mega Man, you get in this game - you can't choose your weapon right. You're not collecting weapons; you don't have any sort of item trove to go through. You just get what you got up and that little square is what you get. Yeah, and that's why so people are so passionate about you know avoiding what they don't need because sometimes like you'll have the holy water, you'll have the whip - I mean, the dagger, you know, the boomerang, whatever, and then you grab it... you're screwed now you have the better one.",

Yeah, it's not like Mega Man, and when you get hit, you get hit back significantly. So the whole feel of the game is just way heavier; you can feel the weight of the character a little bit more. You guys are watching this - oh, he's got some girth to his boots if you know what I mean. I think I know exactly what you mean. I don't know what I mean, but I'm glad one of us got that. Oh, I was too bad. So if that Medusa had been there, she would have just gotten axed. Yep, you got in that cross exactly. And so here we are - this is the Medusa head; it'll come alive.

It's a little meta game. What was annoying about this is that the cathedral is centered like where our head is, but because the stage is two blocks over to the right, like the cathedrals not necessarily centered, so the orb comes down to the right and doesn't make any sense. But in other words, the incongruence really bothers me. I was wondering about that - yeah, you were - but here wasn't no... I was gonna back you up so people didn't think you were some sort of like psychopath yet. Yeah, it's okay though. We've grown to understand your idiosyncrasies and love them.

I want to be exact here and get some stuff like that. But again, I'm in a lot of danger; I'm gonna get hit one more time. I own a pistol; I got hit so much in the beginning - it's really my bad. I was talking about your pride, it messes with your head a little bit. Now, if I help you, need that I need Holy Water, I need the Whip, meet the Wall, need any of that? Absolutely, man. I've never thought I'd need Wall Meet until right now, but you know what - that's what my life's been missing all these years: Wall Meet. Get that, Igor! Oh no, you didn't want that! I think there is Holy Water on this stage okay, but I need Holy Water again. Scurvy Brats sucks as that Wall Meet. Thank God, yeah, I needed that. Oh god, that's uh... I can't be Alucard out there without the Holy Water, so hopefully we'll find it, we'll find it, we'll find it.",

You'll get it back, I hope so. I really need it, ma'am. Elsa got it back, and Frozen that's what I heard, but she had let it go first, you know? I mean, yep, yep, I don't not a big thing, dude. You know, I mean ain't nothing but a chicken wing. Oh look at you. So you haven't done the new attack that much right now. You were you are just getting fancy, my friend. Summarize what you sow here. Golden boots and your thigh highs? Where is Boots so tall? Just why always wearing knee pads? I can't tell. OOP, I'm gonna get hit. Damn, screwed myself on that one. Well, you have to wall me.

I mean, it's so funny that like there's so much strategy to these games that I never realized. Knows okay, when I was a kid, I was like, \"I'm gonna fight some skeletons.\" Walking this is clearly a night that's as far as I thought. Look at this, you got a little bit of a haircut there. Oh, ****, I'm talking to you! What no, no, it's like you're buying your head. No, you're definitely not my head. Click that freeze time comes in handy, huh? It is. It uses so many hearts though. Can I get... I'm gonna be well. Luckily when you hit the cameras they turn into hearts. It's a coincidence that they're crazy like the real world were like that. We're like, \"You blow a candle and it turns a little heart,\" you know?",

Guess I'll just take it, use it, throw holy water at demons. Alright, so I'm through another checkpoint, which is nice. I'm almost there, actually. But again, I need holy water. Yeah, we're losing light. Tim can you check the iris, you ISO up - it's getting intimate here, it's getting candlelit, which is kind of convenient.
