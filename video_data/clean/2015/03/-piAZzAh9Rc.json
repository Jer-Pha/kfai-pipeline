It's like... you know why? It sounds like the original Terminator from the 80s. So, this is a run-and-gun SNK Playmore classic game. Um, people really enjoyed playing this in the arcade when it came out in 2000 or 2001, I think. When people were really playing it there, it came to the PS2, which is where a lot of people saw it for the first time in the states - a PS2, yeah. Wait, it came out in America... Tim, Crush, I think so. Really, way late thing, see? Cuz I remember I did play it on a PS2, but I had to import it. Let me see, I'll look it up right now. I might have just imported it. Wait, we'll find an answer. Why is my phone... Boomstick? Why is my phone all screwed up? That boom stick wants to get in the thing. There we go. We're going. I'm going. Am I going in? Let's see.

You guys are so silly. Contra is a classic, and I'd love to do a let's play on Contra. Why would you like that more than this? How is it better? Because Contra has better controls than this game. I'm not saying Metal Slug is bad; Metal Slug is very good. But Contra is a classic, and I don't think Metal Slug is a classic. Metal Slug is a classic - in that it's old. Contra is a better game.

Have they ever done it? I'm sure probably in Japan, there's something Metal Slug. You have to assume right? See now I'm a zombie. I assume a lot of weird things about people.

So good job guys. But anyway, so guys that was the first and second missions in Metal Slug 3. You guys should definitely play this game. Let us know in the comments why you think it's better than Contra. I don't even want to say that cuz I'm not saying it's better than Contra. I just like both. Let us know why you like both. Crazy if you think that Contra is that much better than this but uh, you know let us know why Contra is a revolutionary game. That so that **** that **** **** happens anyways until next time. I love you. I thought we were going to play Battletoads, that's how you got me here. Nope.\"",
