Isn't this wild Pok\u00e9mon live in tall grass? Well, Pok\u00e9mon live in tall grass. That should be a lyric in a metal band. And all right, so Professor Oak.

We have a Pok\u00e9dex, so we can actually categorize the Pok\u00e9mon. What do you think? Damn it, a Pokedex yeah yeah you nailed it. So now we can just leave that's how we keep track of who we've killed or who snuffed out... no not quite. That keeps track of which Pok\u00e9mon you've seen with a book one you've caught and how many badges you have okay from Gym Leaders you've defeated because it once you get eight different badges you can go to the Elite Four and by fight them and then you can fight the champion to become the champion, a champion right now.

So, you get them in there, and then the ball just sits there, and it rocks back and forth, and it's the most nerve-wracking thing in the world. You're just sitting there, and everyone has their own little strategy to it; doing anything doesn't do anything. Okay? What people have is if they hit down B at the right time as it's beeping, they think that catches it better; it doesn't. Okay, but there's a lot of depth going on in this game. And then what happens is he's in the ball; does he suffocate? No, no; he's fine; he's just chill. You're just hanging out, and then you can throw another unsuspecting passerby. Oh, yeah.
