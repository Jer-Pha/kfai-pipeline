But then I got a lot of, a lot of questions from people that we need to answer. Some of them are geared towards Alfredo and your taste, and some are geared towards the group. So, one topic's going to be questions to Alfredo, one's questions to the group. This is going to be fun, let's get into it. Topic number one, Kevin, this is topic number one. You were very worried about this beforehand. I was more worried about topic number two. He got this, he got this.

If you want your topic go over there, you can do it too. The topic is persistent online mode. It seems like more and more games are coming out that are constantly online, which I find to be quite disheartening. It seems like a great deal of game-breaking bugs recently are related to online connectivity, not to mention there are a number of AAA games out there, most notably Watch Dogs, that are forcing you to interact with other players, which as a mostly solo player, I hate. What are you guys' views on persistently online games and do you think it's just a fad or is it here to stay? Thanks and Kinda Funny he gets it, see he understands Colin, he understands, yeah he gets it. Someone someone out there gets it. If it'll be a fad, gentleman remains to be seen.

But it's it's annoying in the same way that last generation introduced this thing where you put in a game and it doesn't just start playing like every other generation; you played games now they're media consoles and they do all these different things, and that sucks as a gamer. But then you just kind of get used to it, and that is what gaming has become so now it's just normal. I think that's going to be the same thing with the online thing where it's like right now it sucks, and everyone's like \"oh man,\" but see what I'm talking about is like if it if it'll turn out to be a flaw or not depends on I think it's going to be around forever.",

Right now, I feel like yeah, it's being shoved down your throat a lot, but there are good experiences you've had with games that aren't doing it that way, you know what I mean? Colin and I like a lot of games that we play single-player, Hell Divers or Freedom Wars, right. But when you need to or have to, you can connect online now, even that's skewed the wrong direction, right. That Freedom Wars is so tough at a certain point, I have to have people playing Destiny; I have to be playing with people, yeah. But but that's kind of making your own point, that's antithetical to your point because Hell Divers is like your stats just like in Dead Nation, you like Hell Divers compiles your statistics even if you're playing single-player.",

Should be enjoyed as single-player, much like The Order: 1886 \u2013 for as bad as that game wasn't bad, for as subpar as that game was, there was no **** in that game; you know what I mean? Like it was just the campaign, that's what it was. And I wonder when there's issues with a game like not even Titanfall and Call of Duty \u2013 and all these aren't even good examples \u2013 but when a game like Tetris Ultimate is actually a great example: Tetris Ultimate was a Ubisoft game, and Ubisoft shoves you to play online with every one of their games except for the fact that it **** broke Tetris Ultimate, and it was broken as of two months after the game came out.

And do you think it could be the reason that just more people are online and maybe they see numbers that show people play their game longer if there's more incentive to do something with other friends and people - yeah, of course.

And it's one of those things that I think console players, uh, and first-person shooter console players might find sounds like so crazy and interesting, but it's just what MMOs have been doing forever - it's what WoW has been doing forever, like here's your daily, here's your dungeon, here's this thing, here's that thing. And motivating you to keep coming back is like...what's always not worked for us personally in the industry, we're finding is the fact that we just don't have that much time usually to give into it right. Like I love DC Universe Online; I think it's the best MMO of all time because it's the only MMO I've ever played that I fell in love with, and I've got like 500 hours in it. But the problem is that like for me to jump back into DC Universe Online, I know I'd have to get",

Ah, um, so a friend of mine, a fellow Twitch streamer of mine, Spoon... um was like, \"Hey, I know how many hours you've played in Destiny. Do you want to know?\" And I was like, \"No.\" And of course 5 minutes later I was like, \"Okay, how many? Um, 950 hours. What the... 950?\" So here's the thing: I believe it. I played Destiny a lot and like it doesn't mean that I absolutely think that Destiny is the most amazing thing of all time. It has a lot of issues; there's no story; there's not like you do things repetitively, but I don't know for me personally. I think one of the things that keeps bringing a lot of people back or just for me in general is the fact that at its core, the gameplay is good, and it just got to the point where...

That should be the next leap for them. I have no idea why that game's out on PC, and like, wouldn't that make a lot of sense for them too? You know, to be in that space where people understand those games better - you know, they like shooters, and they understand MMOs, so it would make it would make more sense for them to do that.

Yeah, advice on advancing in skill playing a first-person shooter. I tend to plateau at a certain skill and don't improve, says Knight x Hawk. Well, I mean, I think with just any shooting game in general, you always want to find out what the best weapons are and stick to those right? And then I would say for another thing, like learn what your weaknesses are. Like, if you have a rep playing FPS, you get close to me, I lose my thumbs; I don't know how to deal with you being in my face like that. So I always try to keep my distance. So like, learn what you suck at and don't do that pretty much. Um, and uh, map tip: compensate map control. Like when you have control of the map, you know where the enemies are coming from; you know what I mean? Like, you you you know how much of the map you control.",

But if you know where everyone is at all times, it's good. Yeah, practice, stay at it, learn the maps. Just keep playing. What you did for me with Titanfall, I would say, uh, think of everything as a play right? So think of it as like well what could I have done differently during that play right? Should I have thrown that nade or should I have charged like that right? And uh, always kind of awareness is huge. Just always be aware of your surroundings. Awesome.

And I'm like, there's every reason to be very scared about the way that game is going to work. But hopefully with their early Alpha and all these kinds of things that they're figuring it out and understanding and identifying these problems. But this goes back to what Greg was saying at you know full circle kind of thing where it was these connectivity issues are breaking games and frustrating people at the same time, of course Halo needs to work online; it's not one of those games that you have the luxury of playing offline \u2013 you can play the campaign, I guess.
