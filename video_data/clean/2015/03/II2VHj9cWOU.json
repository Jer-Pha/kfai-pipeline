What's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg Miller, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So thanks for your support on Patreon.com/KindaFunny.

Like, I don't know how that combination of companies could come together and just fail the bed, but here we are, you know. With uh Final Fantasy XIII so take everybody back, that's what I want to do. I want to know what you've liked about them, and then for what was the last game that was good from them, and then when everything went wrong.

He got like a discount because he bought like three of them or something. It was like some weird thing, and so like I paid like $40 for it, and he got it for me.

I was in Japan before they released that trailer, and they showed it to us behind closed doors, and I was like, \"This is really pretty. What the hell is this game?\" You know?
