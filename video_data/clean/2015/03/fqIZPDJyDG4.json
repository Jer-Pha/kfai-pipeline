Guys like Steven Spielberg didn't finish film school, he dropped out of college, but he got in there and tried it and he understood what his emotions were pulling him to and that's the thing that I think. I think you're right, Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard too, and that's a different story. But those are like exceptions, not rules. I'm not saying don't go to college, but if you drop out of Harvard, you have to be pretty foolish, you know? Like, that was a real risk for him and Paul Allen.",

So it's not like it's not like you know there's a practical application to those kinds of traits. But I don't want people to get caught up in the fact that like well you don't have to go because the fact of the matter is during the depth of the American recession in 2009, the unemployment rate was like 10 or 11% but for college graduates it was 4%. And that's a loss on a lot of people. Like the college unemployment rate for college-educated people was really low, yeah I was thinking and I was like okay that's interesting, I don't think it ever got higher than like five maybe five and a half percent for college graduates and that's just because there is a barrier entry in terms",

I don't think it ever got higher than like five maybe five and a half percent for college graduates.\" And that's just because there is a barrier entry in terms of maybe some more secure jobs or things of this nature. Again, it's an Amorphis and kind of nebulous thing, but I don't think it's necessary. But I do encourage people to get an education because I think that college is important; it's a very important social thing. It's an important you were talking we talked uh to a gentleman before you were talking about you know you went to UC Irvine and how it's a commuter school. Like, I was happy that I went to Northeastern because like every lived there and like it was a great experience for me. And that's just an important social experience for me; I met all my like all my closest friends from college.

Um, if you're not that kind of person, go to college because college will at least put milestones in front of you that you have to achieve, yep, and that's very, very important. I was talking to my buddy Brennan; we want to do another short film; we want to try to do a short film for Horror Fest New York, Horror Fest, which is happening next year, um, Phobos, too, and totally uh Mike Gransky special, and I was talking to him, and we both realized we came to the conclusion that we're like if we don't have a goal, a deadline for some for this thing, it'll never get done, so I'm like the most important thing is having those goals, those little mini milestones that you can put in front of you, and college kind of helps teach you that you have you know uh midterms you have what",
