The thing is we've been seeing trailers for this game for 8 years now and I was so excited when I saw the first one. And like the music - the music to me from the first trailer till now I'm just like they're **nailling** it. And I think that music is such an important thing for Final Fantasy games, because Final Fantasy is so narrative and so the story is so important, and you have to connect to it emotionally. And music just makes you connect to things better. And I feel like the one thing that this demo nailed more than anything else was the right music at the right time to make me feel how the game wanted me to feel. Like this is the first time in a Final Fantasy game that I played that there's multiple battle themes for just regular battles, so depending on which monsters you were fighting there'd be different songs and stuff, and I thought that was cool. Um, the gameplay was fun, um, the battle system was",

I think that the game is button mashy, but I think it's way deeper than that. It reminds me of uh the way I felt about Final Fantasy XIII. I think one of the ways the one of the reasons things I love the most about Final Fantasy XIII was the battle system - actually, the battle system was really, really good and dynamic. And what you learned about it is like it seems simple at first, and it really isn't simple at all because you have to use magic and do all these things in XIII in XV, I think we saw pretty quickly when we were fighting harder enemies that there's way more to this than than um just hitting the square button. Yeah, so that's the thing - it's not about just hitting Square to win; it's just more about I was more taken back by how much you had to just keep hitting square like strategically timed but like it just it seemed excessive especially some of the the battles",

And I also thought that the system of helping your friends up when they fall is pretty cool because you have two layers of hit points basically in the game um and you don't use a phoenix down on an enemy or on a character that is crippled or whatever you want to disable in some way, you use a potion or you can just lift them up with your hand go up to and press X and get they get about a third of their health back. And and that brings me to another cool thing that I think the game does that's really interesting in more of the active Time battle kind of way it does uh this game does is that you can hide from enemies in the battle which is cool, and if you hide you would",

Like Final Fantasy used to be the thing that pushed the graphical limits of the system it's on, and this... it looks great. Well, it it doesn't I think because this is an artifact from a PS3 game, so I think that like the the textures are probably not quite where they needed to be. And Stu, I I don't give a **** about the way the game looks; it looks fine, like it looks good, it looks... I think it looks great. There's going to be pretty open-world games, yeah, like when I when we played a game like The Witcher, like I think The Witcher is much more impressive looking in terms of the world than I think Final Fantasy XIII or XV is in my opinion, you know, like... and so um the other things that I took away from it, I don't know how you feel about this kind of stuff is first of all there are",

It definitely won me over. I think it's a good demo. Like, I think that uh, it's hard to show off an RPG like Final Fantasy XV in a short amount of time, but I think that this one did do a good job of giving you a tutorial that you could skip if you want, and then going out into this giant world and giving you a good enough space to be able to do stuff every once in a while look over at your screen see where you were at and always doing something.",

I don't think it's terrible or even a bad game by any stretch of imagination, but there is a severe disliking of that game, fantasy yeah exactly so and I think that a lot of people looked at it as something that's like well this is a linear game, there's no customization options, it's all about these Paradigm shifts and really not about your equipment and all this kind of stuff how are you leveling and and I think this game is a reaction to that so now it's about there is deep customization options in multiple ways you are wearing all sorts of equipment you have all sorts of weapons.",
