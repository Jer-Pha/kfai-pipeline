I had my own website when I was a teenager, you know, and I read a lot of IGN and Eurogamer stuff, yeah. And uh, yeah. So I went into online after that, and I did you know I worked with Eurogamer and other websites for a long time before I joined IGN, and now at Kotaku. And even in that time, like it just changes every year, every year it changes. Like IGN was very much like a combination of you know I don't want to say marketing but like publisher driven. Here's the thing: we want you to show your audience stuff, and then entertainment, and then like criticism and reviews. And at Kotaku, um, it's different again.

Early internet was so like that. Like, there weren't any editors. I mean, actually, I think one of the greatest tragedies of the loss of print media is the loss of subeditors \u2013 those people who used to just craft things and make them look good on the page and fix all your grammar and make it consistent with everything else that was on the website. We've lost subeditors basically, and it's a shame; it's a loss of a craft that I think was important to writing. MH, yeah. I got away from calling journalists lazy early on. I mean, that's what I was talking about in a story I tell when I was working in the daily newspaper \u2013 you know, going to cover this congressman's press meeting and it was a boiling hot Missouri day and I'd walk there like an idiot and I was sweating like...",

There's always going to be stuff on the site that's not the best or there's always going to be something that's um even if it's not a mistake if it's just like a low-value like \"oh here's a video that's cool you know\" or \"oh here's a picture someone's done\" there's always going to be three-line stories because unfortunately that's kind of the way the online media works now",

And that's the piece of the puzzle that always bothered me the most is that people would go into the comments of a story and be like \"I hate this kind of writing.\" I'm like, \"But you're clicking on it,\" and that, and that, and that is sending the metric message that you like it. If you don't, that's another thing. If you don't want to see the stuff, you don't want to see, do not consume it, you know what I mean? Because then the numbers will plummet, and you'll get more of something else. You know, one of the things I like about working at Kotaku is I think the ratio is pretty good - like almost everything I work on, I get to spend time on, and I really enjoy.
