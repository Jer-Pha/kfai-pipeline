No, I understand that, and uh, the level design was awesome, the music was amazing, and uh, some of the physics you... The biggest problem with Sonic is you just hold right and jump a lot, right? And then whenever it actually turns into a real platforming game, that's when it all falls apart because the physics are just off everything's super floaty and shitty. Look at this, I'm not I want to be clear that I'm not touching the right stick; the camera is a mess like do you see like how like I mean it's it's it's magical really Colin, this is what games are all about.

Sonic Adventure 2 had its moments, and Adventure one also did, but I never really liked them. Um, and then there's a lot of nostalgia for Sonic the Hedgehog. I'll give it up for that \u2013 a lot of Dreamcast Nostalgia, exactly exactly. But then we got into the you know Sonic Heroes era, and like all that stuff, and the infamous Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 Fiasco when it came next year. Sonic Fiasco 2006 is it's known in the history books. Oh my God, do you know what I'm talking about? Where he at the end of the game freaking makes out with a human? Oh no, I don't.

I want you to understand that maybe I'm supposed to be doing something but I'm not doing anything here except for pushing right or left; I didn't do anything there at all, you didn't need to, you had Chaos (Clarice) helping you out. This is the best part of the game, this is the best part of the vertical slice that they had here; Chaos is now I'm gonna give up to Blaze Hedgehog because she really, she really could keep up with Sonic; you would think that Sonic is, I mean Sonic's reportedly the fastest thing alive but Chaos is right there next to him.

Wow, so that was kind of weird; that is a little weird. And then I don't know how I feel about that. They kept making Sonic games, and they were just bad after bad after bad, and people kept thinking they were going to be good, and they weren't. And then the whole \"Werehog\" thing happened with Sonic Unleashed, where you could turn into a werewolf because, you know, gameplay. There's just no focus with the Sonic games; it seems like they're not.
