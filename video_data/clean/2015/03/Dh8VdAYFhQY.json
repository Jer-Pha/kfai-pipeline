I'm never a big fan of buying a new one just to buy a new one, but it's so sexy - it's got you know, the sacred symbols they call them, you know, triangles, X, Circle, squares. Yeah, smell it; it smells like spray paint. I like it; it does straight up smell like a can of spray paint, so good. It's like gasoline; it's like you know, you shouldn't be smelling it but you want to. First things first, I'm going to... first things first, Chocolate Starfish is your man, FR. Access Hollywood, License to Kill, A Redneck from Jacksonville. You trying to take that little plastic off? I think it comes off this way; here is that easier; there you go. You get it; I got it; I got her; I got her nice and tight; there we go. I want it to look super sexy; there it is, the shine, the sheen. Of course, the original - thank you. Put it right on me; graft it to my skin so PlayStation will always be a part of me. Um, it's of course the color system.",

Um, it's of course the color scheme of the original PlayStation. Yep, it's awesome. They got the rainbow PlayStation logo - everybody missed it. Brings back some cool memories. Yeah, and as you can see, as we already pointed out at the bottom, you have your little unique number uh out of 12,300 back looks pretty much the same. What's cool yeah is the texture of it really neat. Um, it has you know the symbols on it - as you were saying, it's really really a pretty impressive looking system. But I'm the same as you like this is one of those rare ones that really caught my eye. Usually I don't care about that if the system if the whole site hadn't been crashing during PlayStation Experience, I would have gladly bought and thank God it smells like it smells awesome - smells like spray paint yeah you're going to sleep next",
