And I have two very special guests with us, good friends of mine that I met at Northeastern University, Kevin Reid here in the Rangers onesie and Ramon Narvaez in the, in the, in the very stylish Quebec Nordiques jersey. That's a fucking dope jersey. So too is the Zarley Zalapsky Hartford Whalers jersey that I'm really feeling. Maybe the only Zarley Zalapsky Whalers jersey in the entire world. Nobody would buy that. Maybe the only one in the entire world. Why are we dressed like this? Let me, let me, let me explain, Greg. Okay. NHL 94 is a seminal game, perhaps the most popular single sports game of all time. People love this game. And what's so advantageous about having my buddies Kevin and Ramon here from college that we used to play this game all the time, not only in school, but also when we were younger and older. I, in fact, when I went to your house",

In, in a, we just tried to shut a football game off and made everyone watch us play NHL '94, which they really enjoyed. That's right. So Greg. Yeah. And, and company. I've made this chart here, which is going to show the tournament, the NHL '94 tournament, which I've been, named Jukemania. Jukemania. 2015. And Jukemania is a reference to a college football Madden league that we used to play that was named by us. You talked about it in the Game Over Greggy show. Yeah, on the Game Over Greggy show. Go listen to the Game Over Greggy show. Come on. And so what we're gonna do is a round robin kind of thing, somewhat where we're all gonna play each other once. Sure.

So what I want you to do here, guys, is. Yeah. Well, first of all, let's do this. Tim is off-screen. Tim, give me a number between one and six. Six. Six.

And we would play Madden and Ramone was really upset that Kevin had a lot of skill with jukeing. I found out the updated story. There's a little more to that story. Yeah, tell us more about it Kevin. So, there was an instance where he threw a controller on the ground in anger and screamed \"I can't take this Jukemania.\" What you guys didn't recall is, well it was only me and Ramone in the room at the time. But, to start the game I lined up for an onsides kick. I then audible into a regular kick. Ramone didn't know how to audible at the time so he got stuck in onside kick mode. Keep telling the story. So I kicked it into the end zone, recovered, scored a touchdown. I then lined up. He was messing with me. You were probably talking shit too as well. I then lined up for another kick onside. And this time I actually did onside kick it and recover it. I then took the ball and juked 50 yards down the field for",

And that's when the controller went into the floor and that's when he kicked me out of his dorm room. And that's where Jukemania was born. And Jukemania is living right now. I can't take this Jukemania and get out of my room. By the way, are you serious? And he goes yes. I need to take this hoodie off. By the way, just in case, because we were talking over it. The Sharks scored, Sandis Ozolinch put up. Came from the defense put a puck in the net to make it 4 to 1. But then Howard Trucks scored another goal to make it 5 to 1. The Sabres are in control of this game, Greg. Yeah. Did you know that the ice is cold? I do know that the ice is cold. It's blue. I'm very familiar with that. Kevin and I both played hockey growing",

Kevin and I both played hockey growing up for many years. And we were familiar with the coldness of the ice. Oh. What about the hardness? The hardness of the ice is also established. So here, so what I love about this is that. How blue is the ice you guys played on? Not as blue as this. It wasn't blue at all. It was very white. I know. The Sabres are not giving up. They're not sitting back. They're not trying to play the trap or anything like that. They're going to continue to try to score goals. Mogilny is like the fastest man on earth in this game. Remember when Mogilny had a great career, but remember when we thought he was going to be like the next Gretzky with him and Lafontaine. That was a talented, very talented team in the mid 90's. Alright. And that's that. And that's the end of the game. So that's Game Three, the final game of",

And Greg and I are both 0 and 1. We will be back for the second video for the second half of the season. And we hope you enjoyed our playthrough. In the meantime, NHL '94. Thank you for joining us.
