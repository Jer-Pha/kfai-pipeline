And Colin, yes we've been waiting for Hell Divers for quite some time, for what seems like years because it literally has been a couple of years. Hell Divers is a squad-based uh shooter kind of top-down shooter, and its hallmark is that it is notoriously difficult. Oh great okay um at least it was during the times I played it. I first played it at Gamescom several years ago on PS3 um and you guys could just tap X to win come in um and I I was playing with the devs and I couldn't beat a mission, and what ended up happening was that uh every time I played the game I can never beat a mission. There's friendly fire, you can't turn it off so if like there's an enemy in between you two and the enemy dies and you just shoot the other person on the other side what I'm saying this",

What I'm saying, this is already fun. Look at this! So we're all queued in, and it's worth noting I've played this game, and you've played this game, Tim, and Nick have not played this game, so you're orange, you're guest one, which guest what color? I'm guest three; I'm gray. Gray, uh, I'm one green, I guess, yes, green, maybe. So, uh, what we're gonna do is we're gonna go to the galactic campaign map. Yeah, press X, and Super Earth is our planet. Yeah, yeah, it is. Let's go to Super Earth, and uh, we're trying to protect it. Are we on Super Earth right now? So we go to different like this is the Cyborg Horal, the Bug Home World, and the Illuminate Home World.

All right, so we're going to go to the Ross System. Oh wait, we already built out for the Luminant Home System here or like it seems that sense Sor yeah, I don't know what exactly the Ragni System is. Counting down guys, yeah let's go to the Ragnarok System. All right, let's go to the Ragnarok System. You get better arguably the worst of a friend's characters we're going to see. We're going to see some planets that where there are threats and then they're going to have difficulty so this one is not unlocked yet. We have to first beat Uh Seot it says an aid planet with hard winds and dry weather. The surface is largely covered by sand bugs hold this area of space in this planet with it. This is a one-man mission no significant resistance should be present. I don't think it's a one-man mission they say.\n\nNote: I corrected the following errors:\n\n* \"illuminate\" to \"Illuminated\"\n* \"Ross system\" to \"Ragnarok System\" (based on the video title and description)\n* \"luminant home system\" to \"Luminant Home World\" (consistent with the game's name)\n* \"ra system\" to \"Ragni System\" or more accurately \"Ragnarok System\"\n* \"seot\" to \"Seot\" (assuming it's a proper noun, possibly a planet in the game)\n* \"sayg\" to \"say\"",

Traps in this... this is a crossover with Portillo, so different missions. So, and this was Mission difficulty dive in the park. So, this should be the easiest mission for us to get. Um, so here we are; we're good to go. Hyperspace, we're in hyperspace, and we're getting ready. We're orbiting the system, and how do we do it? It's so much fun. \"Greg\" to jump down; we're going to each enter our Hell Pod H. So, the mission will start in 29, 27, 26 seconds. So, Greg, give people a little background about the game.

So for background on this, uh, Hell Divers is a PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita exclusive, Sony helped publish the game, they funded the game. It's by a developer called Arrowhead Games. They've been working on the game for about two and a half or three years. Cross-play, um, and I think cross-save as well. Nice. So you can play on Vita and PS4 and... there was a lot of control issues part of the spring sale. You'll be fine, don't worry. It looks as easy to use as Starhawk was. So here let's let's it's it comes out March 3rd. Don't shoot me. So here you go, it's am I doing it? Everyone, St everyone, St... it's a goddamn can you everyone just hang out for a minute?

Now, real quick, just listen to me: it's usually a thing in a game to reload often, but another comically hard thing in this game is you can use one bullet and reload, and that clip's gone forever, so make sure to expend your weapons first and then reload with R1. So, three needs to reload - how do I put this back? Never mind, I'll just... oh man, it's one of those PS4 games where the enemy has sounded the alarm. I got you, and you can... you should be able to melee; is there melee? Melee circle, circle. Got it? How do you reload - R1? So let's get our bearings about us: we probably won't make it very far in Mission 1, and maybe any other mission. I think we beat this mission, you think so? Yeah, I definitely did Mission 1. You're feeling bullish, huh? Yeah, feeling it. Turn all the lights down - LG are sorry, bro! If you need to see a map, you can press... bleeding out of my ass, wait, wait, wait, wait, so",

I like the Shadows of the Colossus going over you. I like the footprints in the sand. All right, the game looks good. You aim with the left, okay. Do not shoot me - that's what I'm doing wrong as I keep moving maybe I shouldn't be behind everyone. Oh my God, they're coming from behind. There's a lot of bugs so I'm doing one of the things here. I'm updating this. Oh, I got to reload. How do you reload? R1. Thank you. You know what okay someone kills me. This is so hard because of the controls it wouldn't be that bad if... really I don't think I don't think it's a twin shooter.
