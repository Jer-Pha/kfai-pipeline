I'm your host Greg Miller alongside the coolest couple in video games, Nick Scarpino from Kinda Funny Games. Hi, and then of course Kristine Steimer joins us today. Tell Daniel to **** off from Steyr say.com - tell Daniel to **** off. Danielle, oh you're yeah, tell your wife to **** off. I'll I mean I'm your boyfriend and I'm right here, I know but you already know I established that's what's happening. Um we're here without Tim Gettys and without Colin Moriarty because they are sick with the plague - the Pax plague, they call it. This was actually my doing, I was like they're never going to invite me on any of their podcasts so what I have to do is while they're at PAX, I have to just make sure that they eat something with this strain this virus if I can infect them. So three fifths of the Kinda Funny crew goes down, they'll have to use me might as well.",

We couldn't have set it up at all. So you, you, you calculated the perfect amount of people to knock out. Yeah, good move on her part. And it's great. Yeah, and then but I honestly believe they would have had me rather than Nick on this. I'll be honest with you right there, cuz I am when when you hit me, you're at below the bottom of the barrel as far as no Nick, we love you.

Is you kind of have to take whatever you can when you first start off doing anything. You kind of have to write for whoever you can write for, you build your resume, you get your foot in the door, and you start learning the skills that you need to actually start um to be successful.

But I prefer them to because I think most it's not as bad now, I'd like to think most multiplayer games put in games now because the team wants to make multiplayer games of some kind. But it was for a while where it was how do we fix this? Put multiplayer in it. And there were so many half-assed ones, like Tomb Raider - the original Tomb Raider multiplayer, what is this called?

Well, you can update that. You can have someone just go to... you know, you can download something a little easier, a little better, a little cooler. You know, you have the opportunity to kind of fix the plane while it's still in the air. Uh, with video games, they actually updated The Witcher combat, which is pretty interesting.
