So when they went to they made this jump to realism, which was unusual for them, and I think important for them internally to get away from that. They were um, I certainly didn't expect that the game was going to be as good as it was, and I didn't pay much attention to it until 2008 when it was re-released for trophies, and then I went back and played it. I'm like this game is really awesome; I should have probably played it when it came out. I remember seeing it being like, \"It looks fine; it's just not my kind of game.\" Um, but it was very much my kind of game, and I'd actually like to see the sales uh figures for Drake's Fortune after or around the time Uncharted 2: Among Thieves came out.

Cuz like we said, of course, yeah well like no, you know so many people didn't have a PS3 when Uncharted one came out right, so that you get in, you get hooked on two and you're like oh there's already another one of these now that I have the system I might as well go out there grab it and get on board with what is you know. I think it became pretty obvious as they went that this game series became the most important PlayStation franchise of that generation, yeah absolutely and and for as well as these games didn't they did very very very well each sold millions and millions of copies almost surprised they didn't do better, yeah no totally and that's why it's so exciting over what's going to happen with the PlayStation 4.",

You know, I'm not trying to say I hope not; I hope they don't kill Drake - that would be too much for me. But it's too much for me like when we thought again spoilers and Uncharted 3, when it looked like Sully died, and you thought that for a while.
