            "text": "\"All right, so today we're going to jump into Mega Man 4. Now my affinity for Mega Man 4 has grown over the years. Mega Man 4 is still out of the six Mega Man games on NES, my second-to-least favorite Mega Man game being my least favorite actually. But Mega Man 4 has grown on me. Uh, I think it's actually very well-made. It's a very well-made game. Robots are interesting. Uh, difficulty is right introduces kind of a different kind of plot. Um, but uh, yeah we'll get into it. I want to watch the intro first because this is the most robust intro so far in any Mega Man game. Um, and I actually really dig the intro too. So let's enjoy it. I'll be quiet for a minute. I love this shot of him on the train. So awesome. And I like the text: 'Mega Man shattered Dr. Wily's plans three times and we so far, but history repeats itself, of course. It doesn't Mega... But it's not what you think. It's Dr. Wily.' So when they're referring to here, the Mega Buster is a new uh introduction to Mega Man 4.\"",

You could farm them if you needed to need some energy, but you don't really have to here. We continue along now this is when new enemies are introduced: these mummies that shoot their own heads - that's awesome! They spin it by unwrapping it. Yeah, they spin it by unwrapping it. Yes, and you can kill them before they get their heads off if you can; otherwise, you can just dodge them, but you should kill them because they'll go back into the wall then come back again.

When Mega Man 9 and 10 came out, I was working at IGN, and they're just like Mega Man 2 and 3 in many ways - you just kind of brute force your way through the game and figure it out. You're not playing super well at first; you just figure things out, and you know how to play or you don't. So, I think the beauty of these Mega Man games is that all the skills translate. Alright, so Ring Man's done, and with that we go to Dust Man - what was a giant vacuum on his head? That was cool, stage cool music like real cerebral stuff. The music here...

I, I always felt like the the the enemies in the game are a little underwhelming like the bosses compared to the other rosters both before and after with the exception of maybe one which is a pretty boring roster of enemies yeah I remember playing it pretty well so we're at Dust Man uh his uh weakness is the Ring Boomerang and you can see here comes back to you, Dust Man's similar in some respects to Magnet Man and then he can suck you in for Mega Man 3.

There's going to be a dead end here, just like on Dr. Wily's stage, but again we're going to want to uh go down this path because there's an E-Tank down here. So to get to it, you'll use the Balloon Adapter that we found in Pharaoh Man stage, which acts a lot like Item-1 in Mega Man too, as you can see. And then we can get back up here and then switch back over and just jump over the shield as we see it and then slide along and then back to the ladder and then go up. Yeah, it's like an archaeological dig. This is Dust Man; this is Skull Man. Oh, so there's another E-Tank down there. It's precarious to get; we will get it.

Good music here too; these uh mines can't be destroyed so you just have to avoid them again.

Oh, and here we'll get the wire adapter, which is another item you don't necessarily need to have, but it's useful. And then it'll bounce us unlik Far East stage, which bounces us forward. This will actually bounce us back, and we'll have to do a part of the stage again that we've already done, but as you can see here in the start menu now I have wire and balloon, so I have both of the secret items that you don't have to find, but are there for you to find if you're interested.

So Drill Man's a bit of a pain in the ass. We'll use the dive missiles, dive torpedoes here on him. He can go in and out of the ground, uh, and he's invulnerable when he does that. So this first hit is probably going to bounce right off him. See, yep. Well, if it had hit him, I would have bounced off him. So you kind of want to keep just moving and nailing him and see it bounce off in there. Okay, he does a lot of damage when he hits you. There we go. And the missiles also bounce off of his drills, so he has two shields basically. Anyway, that's the end of Drill Man, and now we're onto the eight Robot Masters are done, and now we go to Dr. Wily, uh, or KAC, uh, or Cici depending on how you want to say it.
