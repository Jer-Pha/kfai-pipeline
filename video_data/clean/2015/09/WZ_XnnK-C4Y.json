It's half an inch, shut up, all right. So Metal Gear Solid is taking over everything like it's taking over people who don't play games' lives, like Nick is addicted to this stuff. Yeah, man, Twitter, it's all anyone I get tweets about all the time, and I get tweets from people who say 'I never played a Metal Gear', this is the Metal Gear you've told me you know your Let's Play is, you guys talking Non-Stop about the Bombcast talking about it Non-Stop, and I'm totally hooked on it.

I know, I know, but I think there's a difference though. Like, this is something that I know that we're all passionate about, and you... so what's your case on Metal Gear 5?

No, see I saw you play the game and I was like, this is going to be fun. Just watching you doing just doing the capture and watching the the first like the intro notwithstanding, cuz that's so quintessential Metal Gear to me, like none of it made any sense to me and it took 15 or 20 minutes to just like crawl out of a hospital, I was like dude this game's going to be not my not my cup of tea but then watching you actually start playing some of the missions in Afghanistan I was like dude this looks like",

That's been my nights \u2013 just I keep playing till 3. Now what's funny for me is on Gamescast, you know I'm a very big Metal Gear Solid fan. I played all them except Peace Walker, so I'm in the same position you're in, and I... I've talked so much hearing you talk about this game that you came back and you're like, \"Oh my God, I love it.\" That to me didn't sell it to me of like, \"Oh, I'm going to love this\" because you love Peace Walker; you love the things that I didn't vibe with.

I don't like this stuff,\" and then I started playing it, and it's like, \"I am wrong on all of those fronts every single one of them.\" The story totally is not Metal Gear Solid One or Two or Three or Four; yeah, it's Metal Gear Solid 5. It's a different thing but it's still very satisfying every time there's a cut scene.

Exactly that was always the thing with like Peace Walker when I tried to show him that time, and then talking to you about it or vice versa or whatever - did a let's play one time where you jumped in, and it was like I was 90 hours or 98 hours into the game or 60 hours in the game, and I had all the stuff unlocked.
