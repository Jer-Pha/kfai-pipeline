You could also use other weapons to make it easier, but there's just no need, so we're moving and cruising. These guys, these clown-type characters are going to come on their little tires and kill them; oh, I can't believe I got hit by that - that's embarrassing! So let's get through this guy here, extra life, let's be going to Metal Man, a little hurting here, I think. Now you can get the E-Tank; you don't really need it, um, even though you might use one here to fight Metal Man, to get through them - uh, it's a trap unless you have Item 2, which you don't. Get out of there! This jump is long, so you want to be really careful with it. Oh jeez, so we're at Metal Man stage; he's probably going to kill me, I'll let him kill me and then we'll fight him straight up, but fighting him this first time will",

So I'll use an A-Tank here, just so we have to do this again; we'll get plenty more. You can only carry four, and we will have four in Wily Castle plus we can get them in Crash Man stage and other places, so not a huge deal. All right, so that's Metal Man. We're going to get the Metal Blade now. The Metal Blade is just super useful; it gives us a lot of different options, a lot of different directions we can go from here. Um, we can go to Bubble Man, we can go to Wood Man, we can go to Flash Man. I mean, those are kind of the places we can use metal blades on, and I think we'll probably just knock all three of those out. Um, I guess I'm going to go to Bubble Man first, get that over with. So if you watched our Mega Man 1 let's play, you will have heard me uh during Iceman stage when we entered an underwater area, that the buoyancy of the stage wasn't changed.",

I'm going to go uh and take care of Flash Man now, cuz we have the Metal Blade, man. Get through these guys that we can just kind of clown out pretty quickly. Fantastic music on Flashman stage by the way - please enjoy it with me. And you slide by the way on this stage if you stop moving and the stage is a bit of a labyrinth uh you need Crash Bombs to really be able to explore it fully. We don't have them, those red barriers can only be destroyed with Crash Bombs and we also don't have what we need to really fight these like Ast or like enemies so we're just going to keep moving. You can use the air shooter on them from Airman if you have them but we don't and that's okay. But what we can use here are uh the Metal Blades on these uh squiggly little enemies and then we'll switch back to the Peashooter um to fight this guy, Dr. Wily.",

I'm actually going to go in a different direction, and we'll take care of Wood Man right now, um, since we can use the Metal Blades. You can also use Atomic Fire on uh Wood Man if you want to fight Heat Man first, but it's not really necessary. Wood Man stage is very cool though; I like Wood Man stage a lot, and some more great music. So here, I mean, you can basically just keep the Metal Blades always quit the entire time you want if you let these like robotic jack rabbits stay around too much as you just saw before they'll shoot carrots at you. If you move quickly, you can just get through these guys without fighting them. Here, the these robotic dogs are introduced; metal blades will take care of them quickly. You have to kind of be a little bit careful though; he does look like Rush, but he's not so don't fear, don't don't worry about it; it's not Rush.",

Oh, the hammering - yeah, someone's hammering again. I don't know what's going on. That all right now these guys you can just kill quickly before they even make themselves a nuisance if you don't kill these there you go. Uh, these monkey creatures will jump up and attack you. **** that was bad. So we're almost to the end of the stage ready so couple more parts to get through. Why youp - hm why you? Why do I jump? You move quicker and it's just I just you know it's just how I roll. Kevin, it looks more stylish that way doesn't it? Wouldn't you say, Kevin? Really care all right.

So you want to like not stay down there if you can help it. And then here you can attack these guys uh with your Mega Buster which is fine but as usual the Metal Blades will make quicker work at them plus you can shoot them in multiple directions, which is going to be useful for one of them. Another great soundtrack - The Music's just so good, so see you can shoot him diagonally there kind of cut through and then you here you can just shoot him up again.

This will be item one which is going to be the last item that will get these are like disappearing platforms there's really only one place in the game you have to use in Wily's Castle otherwise they're pretty useless so Crash Man also has great music um and the metal blades here will uh be quite useful so can switch back to the Peashooter now and so here we're going to have to go through a series of these kind of like robot things and here you could use item one if you want but I mean it's not really necessary um use the metal blades kind of do away with these guys there'll always be there can be up to three of those enemies on screen at once and sometimes the best option is to just leave them alone",

So here, switch back to the people to fight this vertical enemy that we saw in Metal Man stage me there we go. And we'll climb up; we'll turn to night after we get through this next couple screens. You can see some of the genetics of like Bomb Man stage on this screen on this stage, which I like. And then here, you don't have to do this, but I just do this because it just makes it a little bit easier.

We haven't shown off Item Three yet, so I'll do that for you real quick. You can use it here; Item Three is like a wall crawler, and you can use it there. So we'll use the Metal Blades early on in Quick Man stage to eliminate these enemies. Um, ah, it's pretty poor showing. Okay, now this is where things get hairy really, really hairy, and this is only the beginning here we go. Got to keep moving; here you can collect a tank, and then we're halfway through, and then here you actually have to know at some point to jump up all right.

This is the only part in the game where you have to use item one, so we introduce it to you. Get to the sign here, and at this point, you can equip Quick Boomerangs. Um, and we'll use them in a minute. You don't have to use my guys; you can if you want, but you don't have to. And so we're almost to the final boss - it's a tough boss if you don't know what you're doing. So here, the idea is to just kind of keep moving. He's going to spawn right behind you. And so my technique here is to get on top and just start hammering him, letting him hit me, and then using my invincibility to try to kind of nail him. And he's going to probably hit me again, and you fall back, and then you just put him away. So that's one enemy down in Wily's Castle - again being ever cognizant of your weapon energy go.",

All right so again let's be cognizant of what we've used and what we need um we could use the Flash Stopper later on Quick Man so we can might as well start filling that up okay we are nearing the end of the game but we have just a little bit more to go so the thing about this area is that a lot of\"",

She's got to get through all right. So there's two ways to go about fighting this enemy, and unfortunately I have to use an E-Tank here. Um, there's six platforms or six enemies, and in other words the only way you can kill these enemies is with Crash Bombs. But there's only enough Crash Bombs to destroy the barriers you have to destroy and the enemies if you use any more than that you're screwed - you're going to have to die and start again. Um, so and you have to keep moving; these things will shoot at you as you see there. And uh, so we'll use a Crash Bomb here and we'll use one there, and then I need to hit the Star and use my E-Tank - it's unfortunate I have to use an E-Tank already because I might need them later.

You have to use item number one, and then hit the button. Crash bombs done. So, in other words, you can't destroy those three barriers now. There's a way to do it if you want to make it easier on yourself: that is, start the battle, use the crash bombs on all the barriers, get rid of them - they'll stay permanently gone when you come back. You kill yourself, refill your crash bombs, then back and just slice through the enemies. But there's really no reason to do that if you're just a little more strategic about it. Uh, so that's basically the gamut of bosses apart from Wily, of course - in Mega Man tradition, we are going to have to fight all the bosses again. Um, so we will do that now.

Watch if I can connect with it; see does half damage kills him, and then Flash Man is the final barrier here, and he's done. You do these in any order you want, yeah. So here it's going to be a little difficult 'cause I'm almost out of uh I'm almost out of blades here, um, and you can use other things like Atomic Fire if you wanted Etc but you don't really have to **** um so you have kind of multiple options here. I'm just going to continue with the Buster especially because I have three e tanks it's not the ideal but it'll do so Wily disappears and he's not quite dead yet, we're going to have to fight him one more time; Classic Showdown, I love this part.

There we go. I'll tank just to be careful. See? Okay, one more time. There's one more hit that will do the trick, and that's it. Then we'll watch the ending, of course. Wily wasn't really an alien; he was made a machine that he's using now, and he'll beg for forgiveness as he usually does because he's a jerk. Someone pointed out to me a while ago.
