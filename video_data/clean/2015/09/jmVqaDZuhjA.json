You can also play this version of the game on Xbox One; it'll be available on PS3 and Xbox 360, etc., etc. You're going to weigh your old jerseys. I'm looking at them, taking just taking a walk down memory lane, you know what I'm saying? I want to see if I can find... I wonder if they have the um, no, they don't. The fisherman jerseys, trust the gold, it's fisherman. Okay, ready to go? Yeah, so now, so Blackhawks versus Islanders in Brooklyn. This is my first time ever playing. Do you want to look at the uh controls? Uh, no, you can explain them here. We... he there right? Do stick left got it? Check sure sure sure move player. So movement is on the left stick for defense and listen, it'll be easy for me to explain it like this: movement on the left stick always checking on the right stick when you're playing.",

Oh yeah, and they're fun. They've gotten quite complicated. You don't have to play them in that complicated kind of fashion; you can dial it back if you want to. Um, but here we go - this is a good matchup: Islanders vs. Blackw... so you're going to press back and then on the left stick and then back on the right stick when you get the puck. That's how you pass - R2 to pass. Oh, po... how do I switch? Switching is R2. Ah, there it is. W me up now. How do I pass? R2. Okay, that makes sense.

Did he not give us a pep talk and not letting anybody have it? It could be my thought would be that he's lucky to be coaching AGL at all and he probably should take the money while again. Oh little glove save by Corey Crawford covering the puck all right, covering the puck playing very judicious game you know how we do it, you know how I like to play my hockey like to play it like Ice Cold Mike Cammalleri so we can skip these let's just get right into the game here.

Like, are these 80 dudes supposed to be back there? Yeah, well, small numbers, single numbers are typically defensemen. And then high numbers are typically offensives, but you know, like 21 is an offensive man here, but like our defense...like, who's on the ice right now can't even see the numbers. So there's no hard set rules, but like, typically, like 13-30, like 130 through 40 and stuff are usually goalies, but not always. Okay, uh, two through nine are typically defensemen, but not always.

You could just say I'm number one, no... I just like being number one, like you're whatever happens, I'm still number one. Guys call me Chicken P Morotti, so I... I like you know but Johnny Boychuk has a high number and he's a defenseman, so it's it's you know they're they're it's not like football - football is like totally in the NHL is totally predictive based on numbers.

Ex well, no, I mean it's just garbage gold, I'm getting but the fact of like cuz that was the big thing with like NHL '95 when we were all playing those back in the day you knew how to aim right, but like this one's so much more dynamic in terms of how you're pulling the goalie and seeing the angles and it'd be cool to learn that and then take it off. That was a pretty goal, I'm going to give it to myself on that one walked right in now going to play classic Islanders hockey and try to protect the lead and then lose by two goals, deaking four players putting it on that blocker save in traffic oh man, two only one back the unorthodox passing it back into the neutral zone play they didn't see it coming clearly went to the one guy but he doesn't it just I I hate that when it passes to",
