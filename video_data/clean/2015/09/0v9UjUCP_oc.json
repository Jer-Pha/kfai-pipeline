And what's hilarious is VHS were like this compared to BetaMax tapes, which were like this big and held more and had a higher quality when they were cheaper too. They were 100% better. And I think I don't know my history as well as I should in the subject but I think what had driven it was that the porn industry adopted VHS, and then that basically put Betamax out of business. Because BetaMax is Sony's format, and Sony's proprietary format, always trying to...I don't know how that worked out, but I guess VHS just got picked up and that was it. And it killed BetaMax - yeah, they still used them until maybe like 10 years ago Betamax tapes were still very prevalent in professional use because it was a good tape format.",

And I, I talked to you about this or Tim about Taylor Swift. I think you were talking to me about it actually. I don't know what I couldn't figure out a way in a tweet to do it without sounding like I was insulting anybody so I didn't. But Kim Basinger in 1989 Batman looks so much like Taylor Swift that either we need to go back in time and get Kim Basinger to play Taylor Swift in whatever bio she does or get Taylor Swift to play Kim Basinger in the Kim Basinger movie.

My friends didn't read comics; you know what I mean? Like going to Comic-Con was just becoming a thing, and I mean, like Chicago Comic-Con - not real Comic-Con.
