Get the **** out of this room. Doesn't really need to do anything right now since they're winning but Sony made one mistake with PS3. Do you think they'll make the same mistake again and can they afford to make that mistake again? And can they afford to make that mistake again in short, I know why these three companies operate the way they do at the moment, but I just want to hear you guys' thoughts on it, thank you men Chong. I think - and this isn't him; I've seen this on the internet before - I think the jump from PS3 to PS4 spoiled PlayStation fans a little bit.

Now the flip of that, of course, and I'll let Colin speak at some point in this conversation is the fact that Xbox has been also awesome at it you know what I mean, you want to talk about a 180 of like all right we said all the wrong things we're going to go",

I think that's the biggest thing we talked about this before a couple weeks ago when we're talking about what features we want to see in the systems. It's not that easy and it's like all these things that seem simple, like \"oh why can't we just change their usernames.\" It's like that requires an entire infrastructure being changed and like being able to work with that in security flaws and all that stuff need to be figured out or else your **** gets hacked and then you get upset when PSN's down forever and all that stuff.

Didn't Reggie say \"we know this isn't the Metroid you want or expect\" or something like well later he said that in like interviews and stuff signifying again yeah this isn't the game I know I know what Metroid game you want; we hear you, it's just right now we're doing this but we hear you and we are listening. This is a thing, right? And I think that's the biggest thing - like we've talked about it before they're in that holding pattern where they're they're not doing that because they're working on the NX; the Wii U isn't the place and all this stuff and it's like that's an issue you know it's like they're obviously not listening but they're a corporation and like the same.",

Uh, when you do things like that at E3, I like that it's their way to talk to people outside of the cycle where it's like we're doing a direct in February and it's about this, and I think that's great and I enjoy that they do that but when they do that stuff at E3, I'm like that's a cop-out, you know. So I think there's it's like it's like six of one half doesn't the other where I'm like you should be at the show this year, they'll be there, yeah, oh, I they'll there's no doubt that they'll probably put the NX out uh or reveal it for the first time in E3, you have to assume so like I think it's a mixed bag but I see a Nintendo that's trending back in the right direction.\"",

But they're becoming a company that's becoming smarter. You can tell that Aonuma before he passed away unfortunately was starting to set the ship right again, and like kind of you know it's like an aircraft carrier when you have to turn it and it takes like a day, you know? It's like he's spinning the wheel and then you know he's been spinning the wheel and and and then he unfortunately passed away. But it seems like that the direction has been charted yeah they're still going that way.
