Jen's Castle, castle level, Mario, Super Mario World style, plenty of doors and pipes, like my last one, a good mix of everything and not too difficult.

I made a more straightforward level, Sizemore One-One, made in the new Super Mario style, utilizes wall jumps often with hazards on the other side. First level I created; they'll get better as I go along. Ronald, all right. Franklin's like Oliver Twist usually, so it only has a 22 percent success rate, like that. This could be the rest.

First one, this is simply a quick movement stage as a few of these stages are the Golden Move and Jump and Avoid. I hope the advanced this is I get more tools to use. Second, the idea of this stage is a rather simple version of a stage from an old Kirby game, just of course play is way differently and with a couple of changes.
