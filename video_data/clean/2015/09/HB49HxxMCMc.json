Also thank you to everybody who supports us on Patreon here; names I want to see them fight all of them, all of them. It's like the Matrix battle, they're they want though because Dr. kicking Amy Gill's F all all these people are so cool, they wouldn't fight each other. What they would do is they'd get together, they go out front night there and they go see a movie; they would yeah but like that's the thing with these things is these the fights don't necessarily need to be people that fight your characters are but like so when are you doing a Superman one versus Goku, yeah that's the one everybody always wants",

That was an idea that was legitimately a thought about the new guy, the new guy in there. We really wanted to do something with uh Miles Morales and throw him in there. I think he's an awesome character and I was kind of stoked when they were rumoring that he would be be awesome. I thought that was going to be so cool. I really wanted to see Donald Glover, like I've been a fan of him so **** awesome - a little old for the the character but whatever it's it'd be worth it.

I was asking all the ENT guys, \"Hey, can you promote this?\" And stuff like, \"I'm not putting Peter Pan on the front of IGN.\" I was like, \"You talking to Colin about it? No,\" but then there were other ones like Chun Li vs. Tifa and that was like, \"All right, we have two kicking characters; that makes sense, you know?\" Um, and then what else... What other ones did we do? One that was really cool was Ico vs. Solid Snake, and they're both sneaking around and doing stuff, and they got David Hayter to be the voice of Snake.
