Recently, I don't know why I do this sometimes where I'll go like I'll be watching a movie and I'll go on IMDb and just start reading facts about it. Um, and one of the things that I love to read, especially the old movies, is the tagline for a movie. Yes, right. And uh, specifically if you're not familiar with this term which I'm sure you are but I'll define it anyway - it's the line of text underneath the title on the poster. Right? And I want to start, I want to just read something to you guys and see if you can guess the movie that they're from. Oh okay does that work for you guys all right yeah this time it's for real you got to angle it away from me CU I won't try to cheat but I will cheat okay hold on a sec I I mean I'm you know how it is your eyes will catch it you'll see it's Lethal Weapon for like **** it's Lethal Weapon, for well all of them.",
