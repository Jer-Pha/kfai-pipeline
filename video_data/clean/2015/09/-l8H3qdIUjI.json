I haven't even seen the figures right? What are they? Take a little Lego guy, and you put them on a little stand, and that's all it is. And then you take that, and you put that into the game, and they drop into the game, and you have them in their own powers in a world... Is it just the figures or is it also like cars and stuff?

Uh, yeah, you know, Marty's Hearts I think were they might have just been hearts or they were, but it had the Back to the Future orange-to-yellow text font for everything. Everybody had that font, like The Simpsons' font was the Simpson font, and I was like, \"I can't believe this.\" And Jonathan from TT Games turns me, he's like, \"I know it's almost as if we care,\" you know what I mean? And it was like, well, damn yeah.

And I'm like, \"Is it going to be like...I love your games, don't get me wrong, and I do love your DLC.\" But your DLC for Lego Batman, right? Like, Lego Batman 3's DLC, the Arrow's DLC is one map, you walk in, you do everything, and it's over. It's like you know, five to ten minutes probably, and you come back to get all the trophies and you spend maybe twenty minutes with it. Right?

We talk about games being platforms all the time, we even just talking about that a second ago in the last topic, but do you see this as kind of the future of Lego games or do you think Lego games are going to exist next to these?
