And we're going to start with my dude Bomb Man. You can also start with Cut Man, but it makes the most sense to start with Bomb Man because you're going to need to do a cycle in which you get to a Dr. Wily stage, um, with the With Dr. Light's weapon. It's complicated now, but you're going to understand a little while so let's let's get it going with it. Oh God, I got Chas me before all right we go. So I'm playing as you know on Mega Man Legacy Collection on PS4. Uh, so I do apologize that the PS4's buttons are a little loud. You're going to hear a lot of clicky clacking as I play the game here, so that's just the way it's going to be. So things that you need to know about Mega Man 1 came out in 1987 uh 1988 depending on where you are in the world. Um, it's a really unique kind of Mega Man game in the sense that it's it's",

Um, it's a really unique kind of Mega Man game in the sense that it's really hard - there are different rules to it: no E-tanks if you hit spikes even when you're Invincible; after being hit by an enemy, you'll still die; it's only got six Robot Masters instead of eight; it's definitely the shortest Mega Man game but I think also like really the most challenging one for sure. Uh, so we're continuing on through Bomb Man stage - uh, not a terribly difficult stage to get through although now that I say that I'll probably die at some point. Uh, those particular flying penguin-like enemies explode; that explosion will damage you if you're near it, so you want to stay away. You can also see that because of the limitations of early NES games, uh, the explosions cause slowdown almost every time you do it, which is why I try to kill them when or try to avoid killing them.",

And and it's tough to like, you got to get him to jump over you. He'll jump high. Let's see if we can... yeah, see like right there! And you just kind of commit. He does a lot of damage; we'll be okay. So one of the advantages of these like interstitial areas during boss fights or before boss fights I should say is that you fight enemies and and most of them, and they can actually drop things like items for you to use to heal yourself if you need to or you need for some reason weapon energy or whatever which we don't... um.

So after doing the trick, we go to the menu, pick up the bombs, the hyper bombs, and we fight Guts Man; he jumps and causes the ground to shake, so you kind of have to be a little patient here. He's coming right up on me; see if this bomb should damage him and hopefully not; he's going to jump right into the bomb, perfect dead. So Guts Man is done; we collect the token now, and we get the Super Arm, his weapon which allows you to pick up these bricks that you see here on the left side of the screen. All right, so we're going to use Guts Man's weapon on Cut Man now; Cut Man again, easy enough, super easy actually to beat with your arm cannon but I don't want to start here and I'm going",

Bless you, Kimchi. Kimchi's off screen sneezing we don't want to let that that sneeze go without you know wishing him well so these guys shoot four times and you kind of have to just time your movements a little bit and you can actually shoot them from behind I'll show you here so we're continuing to climb and we can kind of just ignore these guys and just keep going I'm I'm not so much trying to beat the game quickly as much as I'm just I like to be a little more efficient with the enemies like killing them and whatnot this guy's going to cause me a lot of drama so I'm going to kill him now so they follow me forever these eyeballs another classic Mega Man enemy although they didn't make a real return until Mega Man 10 which is",

There's only two bricks here that you can use if you can connect with both of them, you'll kill Cut Man pretty quickly and I actually glitched it out there where sometimes you can grab it and it still stays on the screen which is quite useful because I did miss him with that second one otherwise I would have to switch to my arm Cannon and kind of go at him.

This was a game that wasn't made like the other Mega Man games with a level of balance. Dr. Wily does an incredible amount of damage when he attacks it's easy to die even for good Mega Man players while you fight him and you'll see him at the end uh this stage also has fantastic music as you can hear all right so the Rolling Cutters are good on those enemies because they're impervious to other attacks so we can actually use it again here to just get rid of these guys so we'll climb we'll switch back to the Arm Cannon which we'll need here and these guys will float down.

This is his weapon, the Metal Blade of Mega Man 1, and what I mean by that is it's just extremely useful, especially in Dr. Wily's Castle. You're just going to use it a ton. Um, and I'll show you what I mean uh in a little while. Next up, we go to Ice Man, a little Eskimo robot Arctic exploration robot. Try to take him out.

There will be multiple robots shot the wrong way there we go. Jump over that guy if you want, and then... You kind of just ignore that guy if you want.

What can I do for you? Nick just wanted to walk in, thank you, appreciate that nice. All right, here we're going to use the beam because these guys are coming right out yes got hit no good all right we're going to continue our kind of rightward trip here. Things get a little crazy here so this is where I'm going to start shooting just kind of always having bullets on the screen and you're going to see why because you're going to want to do as much damage as these penguin enemies as possible, and eventually they're going to start exploding and you have to keep clear of them and they start bugging out too which is awesome. I so I love this I love this uh Mega Man Legacy Collection because it really they really are the straight up NES versions with all their blemishes as you can",

That might be the difference between life and death here. All right, all right. Now we can use the guts. All right. And so that does it for that boss. And now we're moving on to uh the finale, oh Mega Man one. It's tough. The finale is tough. Not gonna sit here and sugarcoat it, you know I'm not going to sit here and pretend this is easy. We can do it, it's hard. And I screw this up sometimes, so let's see what we can do. So we keep climbing. Remember don't avoid these guys, you got to kill them, they will shoot you down. So here is a cleverly placed um, you know what? I'm not we don't really even need to worry about it, CU we are fine on energy actually. And I'm going to show you why because we can replenish all these in just a short",

I'm going to let him pass; just not mess anything up. And then I'm going to go over here, and when I drop into him, you'll see that everything's refilled; everything's replenished now. And so we can go back and go into the portal here. Here we're going to fight the last four remaining um Robot Masters one after the other. This is where things get a little crazy because um well it's just you don't want to, you have to fight them one after the other; you have no extra tanks. Ah, that might have been the difference. Okay, Guts Man is actually the one that's a real pain in the ass, and Fire Man's a pain in the ass too. All right, so we got through him; we're in okay shape. We're going to fight Iceman just to be careful here. We're going to use the trick again with the electric beam. I missed him there.
