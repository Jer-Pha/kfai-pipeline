You know that scene at the beginning of Coming to America where there's like three bath maids and they're all washing off his junk? That's been Greg for the last 17, 15 years. You and I are those mates exactly, okay? So we used to when he had to go do Let's Plays or we have to go do reviews, we'd have to get up at noon. He would walk in and he would always walk in with no pants on, like whatever jeans, cuz like, I don't even have to get up anymore now; I can just wear just the top of my suit, and it's totally okay.

The hell do they know? Well, they always rank the... you know how expensive sports teams are. The Cowboys are number one, obviously. So a sports team goes for like 300-400 million, I think at the lowest end. Like an NHL team would go for like 250 or 300 million.

I tweeted this person and I and I did my best after so much of IGN and how much yeah you suck to be like hey read your article thought it was a cheap shot totally respect your your you know it's an op-ed or whatever right?

So imagine my dismay when the very thing that used to assuage my nerves after a rough day became one more source of stress. How did this polar change happen? Two words: Guy Fieri, that's right, the so-called Rock and Roll Comfort Food King, but more accurately, the extremely unhealthy-looking ear-splitting Maniac who thinks he's like a college garage band circa 1995. All right, wait, I have a huge problem with this. Me and the Food Network go way back, way back, okay it goes way back. The Food Network actually has its heritage on Long Island; a lot of people don't know that now.

I'm okay. Well, look, I'm going to say my mental image of the Food Network is like Martha Stewart - like living kind of thing. That's just my that's fine, I allow myself to be wrong and not watch the product, yeah, that's true. I don't I don't watch I don't watch the Food Network but that's my impression.

Let's break this down one of my biggest pet peeves is the way local news reporters talk, they deliver news to viewers like we're all 5-year-olds with their excessive use of alliteration and disproportionate pauses between words, Guy Fieri has adopted that local news reporter intonation and cadence except Guy is also shouting for some reason he's incessantly screaming at us to eat",
