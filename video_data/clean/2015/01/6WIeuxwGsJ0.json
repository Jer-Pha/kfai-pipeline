I'm Tim Gettys, I'm here with Colin Moriarty and Greg Miller, the coolest dudes in video games. oh hell yeah, yeah, five dude we just did an awesome Resident Evil stream and that was fun, I like watching that, that that was pretty good. A lot of people, yeah, I didn't remember what to do either though, like every time you were like trying to do something, you're like a \"what is this?\" I'm like, \"yeah, I don't... it's been it's been it's been like years since I played that game and how many hundreds of games have I played and those games are obtuse, they are. Is a good way to put it for those old. Were you playing with the tank controls or were you doing no?

Resident Evil's way too complicated and crazy; it doesn't make any goddamn sense. Rebooting it would be nice. Yeah, don't think they won't make those jokes for you just like the Remake I liked, I liked remake was nice. You guys are crazy; it just get over it, stop it; we get it, re is Resident Evil, stop it, stop shoving it in everything. But no, if they redo it and they get rid of typewriters and they make health systems that make sense and you don't control like a tank and basically they just give it to competent developers and don't do the same thing they've been doing forever would be great.

Yeah, that was the thing too, like yeah I I was so satisfied with Black Flag that when Unity popped up and then Rogue, and they were like \"well, is this Assassin's Creed?\" and them but you know I me they go back and forth and everything. I was just like I they they're not even on my list of things to do you know what I mean? Like I I've seen you play it, I understand that it's this, I understand it's that, I watched their video reviews, I read about it to make sure I was up to date on them but then I was just like yeah that's not even something on my list.
