No, so what the **** am I talking about? There's the original 3DS, uh-huh, and then there was the 3DS XL, yeah, and then now there are new versions of both of those. Okay, Han, and they're coming to Europe; one of those is coming to Europe, yes, yes, yes, yes... um, but both of them are already in Japan, okay? What they add is it's like it's faster GPU, right? I got a stick this a stick and stuff, and that it has way better viewing angles, okay, it's insane how much better it is.

They should get rid of that reading mode, never. I don't mind, I've often thought about super moving it down, it's annoying when I'm playing something and I bump it and it kicks off... like, oh, that's the point is that won't happen anymore they say why because because the viewing angles. No, I'm gonna make sure I don't ever **** turn it on, that's why it's not gonna happen. I haven't met any well, I haven't got anyone that uses that reading mode.

I didn't realize that was still an option. I thought the XL was now the standard in America. It isn't; I mean, no, there's still a 3DS in America. It isn't the one I have - the little red guy, okay, okay. And so this is the same red guy just in the with the C-stick. That's dumb. Nobody by that system don't buy that and are putting it in America. Good well good. I'm glad Nintendo's making the choice now because they have inventory to sell through. You have to assume...

You buy that console for the first-party games and the exclusives and everything you want right? And so while they're off making the next Metroid, in the next Zelda, and whatever else they're working on, right? You have to partner with people who will continue a pipeline of content. They've got Majora's Mask stuff over here now. Yeah, my back to this game. Why don't you give this game a try? And that's something really cool I found with Nintendo recently.

But I think frankly both of those games are wildly overrated, and that the the the iteration like the way they were able to iterate later on not necessarily with maybe Super Mario Sunshine with Mario but maybe with Galaxy - that's the real you know 3D Mario game, that's like the bee's knees.
