You know what I mean? He had like the Smallville background.\" I was like, \"I like everything that's going to happen with this guy.\" You watch the movie; his performance is a great performance of Superman in the kind of film they were making. I have...I have a laundry list of reasons Superman Returns doesn't work for me, but Brandon Routh's performance is not one of them. He's really good as being...he's doing a Christopher Reeve impression. I mean, like that's what because that's what they're doing; they're doing a sequel to those movies, and he's doing incredibly well. He's doing a very good alien Superman, which isn't my kind of thing. I like you know Superman who thinks he's more American or more of our world right? He's protecting Earth but all that aside Brandon R was awesome. Superman Returns wasn't good.",

Superman Returns wasn't good; he was saying the next Superman was going to be like Wrath of Man style action. I was like, \"I am on board,\" and then it all exploded. Every time the public turned on Superman Returns, it never went anywhere. Ralph was faded away right, and he did the sci-fi movie \"Dylan Dog: Dead of Night\", which I always thought was weird because he went and did that movie with uh the guy who plays Jimmy Olsen - Sam Huntington did, and I was like, \"That's a weird that's neat but weird.\" And then they turned out to be really good friends now. It's like, Yay Universe! No, no, not at all. Thank you for trying to get me on that though; you got me to smile. So he went off and did that, it seemed like he was fading away - what is he going to do? Where is he going to find his place in",

Is there another Phoenix story like this - someone who was in this movie that was supposed to make this, is going to make your career, you are going to be Superman. That was so much for him to take on as an actor right, of like you're stepping into these boots and only a handful of people have ever portrayed this and you're going to be this guy for the new generation - all people love Superman and then it's just gone. It's like you know I mean that would be the most depressing thing for me is that it's all just over yeah. I mean I'm I'm with you on the Superman Returns in that when you watch that film he is undoubtedly I think the best part of it oh sure I I would say that he does he is the Superman that I wanted at that moment it just wasn't the story that",

A little Brut impression, spot-on Arrow impression, kind of hard, kind of weak. There, I don't even know what he says. All I know is I just remember Clear's Day that he's in the parking lot with some chick at a police station, I think. I'm on the elliptical working out; he's literally just got the Hood up to here and he's just like looking down like this, and just...but I'm so confused. You know?

They tried to play with Shadow a bit to make it seem like it was in a darker tone now, it's totally like Oliver Queen is there, he's talking to the police, you know, Laurel's dad or whatever. And it's totally Oliver Queen and they're just like \"amny\" like I, that kind of stuff disappoints me, just as an aside, because I like superheroes, I like the idea of a superhero and a supervillain, a city in distress, and all this kind of stuff, it's cool.
