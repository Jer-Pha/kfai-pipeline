Kinda Funny Games cast today too. Jesus Christ, strap in. Remember when Kevin Smith wanted this? Yeah, or I... I found a great Hunter S Thompson quote because like on Sunday night when we were launching, getting everything ready to launch, I was of course a nervous ball of just energy and uh, I don't know what I was watching, but there was a great quote that popped up from Hunter S. Thompson that just said \"take the ride.\" Hunter S. Thompson, and I was like, that's Kismet. That must be Hunter S. Thompson from the grave telling me or is he still alive? I can't remember; he's dead pretty much. What did you just say it was Kismet? Kismet. She's a DC Comics character.",

Oh okay, not to go too far off on a tangent but this blew my mind the other day I was looking up don't ask me why through the click hole of IMDb yeah I went from Bond film girls to Superman and I didn't realize that Teri Hatcher is credited all three of them Teri Hatcher, Ursa, are credited in the first Superman movie because I guess they were in a scene in the beginning.

Yeah, it's been cool like yesterday was awesome, like um going to GameSpot walking in answering emails while you guys are doing the show, it feels like every day is production, which it hasn't felt like that in my life in a while. That's going to burn us out eventually, but for right now it's super exciting. Well, it'll wind down though, right?

Those like literally on Saturday when we were prepping everything, I thought it was Monday, yeah, I was convinced like it was a day of the week.

Are they all not back from break yet?' She's like, 'It's Saturday.' And I'm like, 'Holy ****' And that's just that's just production, like when you're shooting movies or TV or film or you.\"",
