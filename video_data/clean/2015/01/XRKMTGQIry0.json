And I was just like well you know what, when you're on the show, I didn't tell you this but in my head I was like I'm going to bring you a Tim topic. So ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in a while here is a Tim topic. Jesus, what are the rules of the women's restroom? When will you go in? When will you not go in? When are you like... you know when will you go in with someone else? Does it like... are you ever going to go in with another dude? Will you go in with a girlfriend or a girlfriend? What are the rules, see they're foreign. That's like going to Mars, I guess actually it's more like going to the Moon. I've only been there a couple times. I don't know what that meant.

And I have to admit, what's crazy is how long do you think it takes? So I was at Starbucks the other day, as I am most of the days, and there was just one dude that's like, \"That's where he takes his morning ****\" so if you just happen to be there and have to go to the bathroom when he's in there, you're going to wait a half hour. So I'm waiting, and I wait for two to three women to go in and out, in and out, finally I'm like, \"I look around; I'm like, 'I'm just going to do it.'\" And this is a standalone room, like you're talking about, but this is a busy Starbucks, the Starbucks over on Chestnut, it's a high-traffic area.",
