Each and every Monday, we come to you with a multiplayer matchup, switching games constantly, rotating chairs of games. Some might call it... yeah, nobody calls it that. Are we going to play Gang Beasts next week? Is it out next week? I don't know, but there's some Steam access if I figure out what that means. It's going to be fun. No, we don't have enough. I want it to go to PS4 because we have plenty of PS4 controllers. Steam controllers to PS4... smorgasbord to PS4. If we figure out the controller situation, we're playing that because I'm going to enjoy it. I think Nick's going to like it; I'm going to like it; Nick will like it a lot. It'll be a big time game for Nick.\"",

I feel like I could Master the risk given two or three more matches just putting that out there. Nick, sing me the song and I'll dance this out. Oh my God, was that cable not in the shop? No, surprisingly, or maybe it isn't. I just didn't see it either way. It'll be exciting. No, it's not okay.",
