I cannot do any impressions and it's upsetting to me because Nick has an amazing hour, I have the world's worst Christopher Walken. I want to hear it; I'm betting you have a great Christopher one, just give me, give me one word. We got to make the circle real quick; it's fine. There you go, man. Oh, Graham, yeah, you have Morgan Freeman. Oh, and the waddle is our receipt; we got all of it over here with Bane. Yes, yes, brother. Yeah, I just can't do another thing I can do, and whatever I do any accident ends up being a really bad Arnold. All I've got is Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, that's all I can do, and that's it. I don't know anyway; that's pretty good, good Arnold. I like your Arnold's pretty good. My pain is getting worse the more pain I think. Oh, it's getting worse and worse.

But I looked at his, he had an affinity for socks, and I look five, you put a little Twitter on it's the one I was starting to publish in New York is like where the **** the socked incomers like do is the most random thing that I could think of, but the philosophy is that life is too short to wear boring socks; that's true.

And I said, \"Nice socks.\" He goes, \"And he looks down,\" it's like we're wearing similar socks. He goes, \"Like, we're twins to each other.\" It's the way you can... do me a huge favor next time you see Jeff Goldblum, yes? Can you act like you just look up and be like, \"You just looking up like JG, good to see you again, buddy\"?
