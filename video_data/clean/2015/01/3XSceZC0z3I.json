Oh hell yeah! Yeah, five dude, we just did an awesome Resident Evil stream and that was fun. I like watching that. That was pretty good. A lot of people... yeah, I didn't remember what to do either though. Like every time you were like trying to do something, you're like, \"Oh, what is this?\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, I don't know.\" It's been years since I played that game, and how many hundreds of games have I played? Those games are obtuse. They are a good way to put it. For those old... Were you playing with the tank controls or no? I was playing with the new controls. They were a little more finicky, but it's a little better without the tank controls. You can play with the tank controls on the d-pad if you want. Mhm, but you shouldn't.",

Resident Evil's way too complicated and crazy it doesn't make any goddamn sense RE would be nice but I want a reboot yeah don't think they won't make those jokes for you just like the Remake I like I like remake was nice you guys are crazy just get over it stop it we get it re is Resident Evil stop it stop shoving it into everything but no if they redo it and they get rid of typewriters and they make health systems that make sense and you don't control like a tank and basically they just give it to competent developers and don't do the same thing they've been doing forever would be great yeah before we get into this rant of explaining the show and all that stuff sure can we just keep talking",

Crazy ass collector's edition that comes with an RC Claptrap which is exciting, yeah. I'm a fan of Claptrap and I'm a fan of RCs. So you gonna get it? No, probably they're probably all sold out at this point, there only 5,000 of them, no. Well we're not so what upsets me about this though is it doesn't include the first Borderlands.

Oh well, that's the thing is that he doesn't know how to growl like that when when you go for a toy and he does this growl it's cuz when I used to do that when I would take toys away from him.\"",

It sounds like he's got indigestion, oh man, true story. He once got babysat by Damon's uh landlord; they have kids, they loved Fortilla, they wanted to babysit him. I came to pick him up one day, and like it was like one of those things where like you could tell 50 things were going wrong at once, like she the the mom's on the phone, the two kids are running around screaming; she's I'm like what's happening, and the kids are well I'm trying to get this like horrible story that's happening to the family from the mom, the kids are like tugging on my sleeve, and I'm finally I'm sorry I'm like yeah what's up guys, and and they",

And when you were talking like playing Game of Thrones, could this be Game of the Year for Season One of The Walking Dead? It was so fresh and it was so different, and they weren't Apples to Apples, I feel because you know who lives and dies in Game of Thrones right, and so now you're getting introduced these new characters and these new families, and you're playing as a family that's not the TV show right or",

But it's like, okay cool, so they could die at any moment. And the fact that I'm jumping around so much means I'm not really getting in a rhythm of liking these people; I'm just getting ready for them to die and do something. Right? Whereas Walking Dead Season one is you're Lee, you're Lee, and this is this girl named Clementine, and all your focus is to protect her. And so to go through that and have those moments of like, \"I don't know what's going to happen here; how do I respond?\" That's where the gameplay and those emotions and everything else comes into play, and makes it a different experience, I think.

Um, you know, first of all, I think I think we were talking about the Game of the Year kind of contention for the original Walking Dead season 1, and that makes sense within the context of the time. Um, that was 2012 right? 2011, no it's 2012, and it makes it makes sense within the context of what uh Telltale Games were before that because um you know if you didn't play I only played a little bit of The Walking Dead with Greg but if you didn't play something like Jurassic Park or you didn't play something like Back to the Future: The Game, or and Back to the Future: The Game is fine.

Is Telltale flies by the seat of their pants; it's as obvious as a day is long that they like really have no idea when their games are coming out - um until literally two weeks before they come out or a week sometimes, and we get emails and like you know talk to people, it's like soon, like soon, and then like out of nowhere it's like it's ready; it's because they're really anytime you see anytime you see them teasing a trailer, you are within two weeks of the game, and then when the like today's trailer I thought it would be that next week was going to be the week, and then they're like no it's two weeks, I'm like all right but that's totally Telltale, very close.",

I think it's four episodes, and they're just doing it every week because the game's done, you know what I mean? And like that's kind of what I wish they would do with Telltale with The Walking Dead or with these other games - just be like the game's done, and now we're going to release them once a week or once every two weeks. And if you at least had a cadence, then it's like okay, the rhythm is you know every 14 days, new one comes out, and then I'll play it as they come. But I don't want to play the game and then wait three months. I mean literally, the time between the episodes is totally random and it's not consistent.

But the way they release games and the amount of games they're doing, which you know we've talked about before on podcasts, makes them relevant all the time. You know what I mean? Like outside of The Last of Us: Beyond when we're talking about like PlayStation exclusives and we're talking about Uncharted or Naughty Dog all the time - even when we don't know what Naughty Dog's working on, we're talking about them being a great developer. Right? Telltale is always relevant in the conversation, which is fascinating, because all of a sudden they're doing it and it makes them... like I was talking about not even so much a developer as much a network - they are they are a network, like a TV network right?

But when you are somebody who just cares about Game of Thrones or just cares about The Walking Dead or just cares about Fable then it is like just a different thing to keep you talking and thinking about this. I don't and what's cool about that too is like once you get hooked into it then you, you're kind of if if you like it enough you're interested in going back.

Yeah, well all right. Is there... The one thing about you asked the question was like how do you play them right? Like I, I, I also want to point out that for me, how I play Telltale Games \u2013 literally how I play them \u2013 is different than how I play most games.

I'm gonna have to ignore the chat, you know what I mean, just not chat because I don't want anybody to ruin that experience for me. But I do want people to be a part of it if they want to watch it.
