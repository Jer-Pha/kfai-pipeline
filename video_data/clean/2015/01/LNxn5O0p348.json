            "text": "what's up everybody Welcome to Oreo Oration I'm Greg Miller and while you were out living your life, the folks at Oreo were making endless variations of milk's favorite cookie. So every time there's a crazy flavor, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to our channel, share us with your friends - can't stress how important that last part is. Today we're reviewing Red Velvet Oreo cookies. Now let me want to talk about a journey the Oreo people have taken us on, ladies and gentlemen. Months ago, a screenshot of this leaked, people start tweeting me: \"Is it real? Is it real?\" And I say definitively no, it is not real. Anytime here's what's wrong with the rumors about the Oreo cookies anytime they get started - whether it be the Fried Chicken Oreo, whether it be the Ramen Oreo - if there's only one screenshot of the package, it's fake. Now I think this probably leaked 'cause it's the exact same milk look here it's the",

Now I think this probably leaked because it's the exact same mil look here - it's the exact same cream cheese flavored cream like this is literally the packaging they leaked with the little thing there on the counter and that and whatever. So I get the fact that that was just probably a leak from someone inside Nabisco, not Abisco, left his iPad on a cookie bender everything went off the rails now they're real maybe Oreo is just testing the waters which is a brilliant thing to do - leak these images then see what happens, see if people want them. I'm standing by the fact that I would love Fried Chicken Oreos, sounds gross when you think about it but chicken and waffles are sweet and savory try it. Ramen Oreos is gross don't ever make those so Red Velvet Oreo cookies they're out February 2nd stores nationwide I got the early taste we're going to get into the review",

We're going to get into the review with the patented First Look. Oh well, before we get into the first look, I guess I can tell you right off the bat: the first thing I noticed is a smaller package. It's a very concise little package here - it's not the big Oreo box; it's the smaller Oreo box, which is interesting. First Look... mhm... mhm. Oh, get that bouquet going now. My lips are touching them so that lets you know how close I have to be to smell the cream cheese part of it - that cream cheese frosting, which is good or bad when you think about it because we've opened them before right? And it feels like a baker exploded in front of you... well, not a bakery; a baker exploding in front of you is much different. But you know, a baker. Okay, anyways. Get in there now. They got the Red Velvet cookie right now - this is what's Oreo's point with this.\"",

Back at Grandma Miller is watching Batman: The Animated Series eating Hostess cupcakes. Let's see how we go on the taste test. Oh, I'm sorry, the twist test. I'm overloaded with good feelings and vibes all right so probably my best two are three one perfect. I'm telling you this is...
