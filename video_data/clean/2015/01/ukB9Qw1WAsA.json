We're trying to do something different than The Game Over Greggy show, which is each of us brings a topic. This is more just looking at the news and then trying to divide it up into four topics. What I want to try today is the last topic being a bunch of little tidbits of news. So we'll have a timing round. It's like all right, I'll take it. So we're going to start off with news that I really care about. You know what? Let's just call this section \"The News I Care About.\" The news Tim cares about. It's timing. Yes. Kingdom Hearts III coming in 2015 according to Goofy. No way. There's no way in hell that game's coming out this year. So that's the thing. We've talked about this on the show two weeks ago when we were talking about the games we're excited for in 2015. And I named this game because, you know, they're pretending it's going to come",

And I named this game because, you know, they're pretending it's going to come out this year. Oh, they're pretending good. They're doing a good pretend game here. Yeah, exactly. And I don't think it's going to happen, but it's crazy that they would let this happen where they'd somehow let a voice actor say this stuff. That's the problem is you can't revoice actors in. You have so much going on with that game, let alone a language barrier, let alone the D. By the time you got out to these voice actors, I totally get that. What a It's like what? Who said what? Yeah. All right. They don't I mean they're not What am I allowed to say? What am I not allowed to say? Yeah. Exly. And that's why like when we were talking to Troy yesterday on the you know Colin Greg live and then the GameOverGreggy show is I would set question was like I don't know how much you can say on",

Yeah. And it's so easy when you're at an event for someone you're you're promoting one game and someone feeds you a question about another game and it's like has that been I've asked questions before and they're like and I'm like no no no they talked about this here and I have to like cite my sources that I already know this exists. Like, oh, okay, then this is the answer, you know. Yeah. And, you know, going from the other side of it, you know, we've been at IGN for so long or we were at IGN for so long that we get all this information, we know all this stuff. We talk about it day in and day out and it's so familiar to us and then someone else will be in the room and we're talking about it as if everyone knows",

You know, it's like just cuz I work at IGN, I'm like, I do not know the inner workings of what Media Molecule is up to. You know what I mean? Yeah, I mean, we know a lot of stuff, but yeah, it's it's it's uh yeah, it is it's hard for us to keep that that extra straight for sure. And like this is weird because Square Enix might be playing an interesting game here where the game's ready, but it doesn't it doesn't make any sense. Like we we've got Square Enix is notoriously slow and Kingdom Hearts 3, there's just no way that game can come out this year. Like it doesn't make any sense unless they've been making it in secret for four years. it doesn't make like any and they just",

It doesn't make like any and they just have another team that no one knows about like making it that then I guess it's possible. The thing is that because of the language barrier and just the culture of Japanese game developers, secrets are very well kept over there. But um you know him saying stuff like \"well my voice acting is done\" like of course it is, it should have been done like three years ago. That that's like the first thing you do. The writer writes the game and you record the voices. It's like when you come back for pickups a lot. That that's true. But but like the the game's written, the game is recorded like a cartoon and then they animate and make the game, you know, like and if they need to. Yeah, exactly. So it's like that's like if that's the reason, and I'm not necessarily saying that is the reason, but he",

Like the the the voices for The Last of Us were probably done. They did pick us up, I'm sure, but I'm sure they recorded all the MoCap and stuff literally three years before the game came out. Not like, you know, it's not like it's that's like a monumental thing to to site to say like, well, the game's coming out this year because my voices are done, you know. Yeah. Um, but he's also saying that that's what he's heard from other people. And that's, you know, I'm like, it's funny because Square has set the stage for it by releasing, as we said, Higurashi: When They Cry Remix 1.5 and 2.5 in sequence to kind of bring everyone up to date on three. And it would be a little weird for three not to come out this year in the sense that the gap would be very big and",

Like I don't I don't understand that, you know, with the way the teams for Final Fantasy XV and Kingdom Hearts III seem to be mixed up. Yeah. Um and fin like like one game has to come out first and like they can work on both of them and neither of them will come out. Um as we've seen with Versus XIII. So I don't know. It's weird. That's a weird story to me. Yeah. That's my thing is I have a feeling that neither are coming out this year. Oh yeah, I don't think so either. And they're just acting like both are.

It looks weird. It looks beautiful, but it looks like a weird game. Game's been in development forever. They have new people on it doing their thing. It's, you know, it's on its way. But it's like to me Square Enix isn't being like acting like anything to me personally. I think they're just like being like they don't know what things are doing stuff. Here's a Final Fantasy XIII-1 if you wanted that. But no. Everybody's like no we don't want that. No no no we don't want that stuff guys. Yeah.

I'm wrong about a lot of stuff and and I and uh I hope I'm wrong because I know people are really eager for that game. People seem way more eager for Kingdom Hearts III than Final Fantasy XV. Um, Final Fantasy is worn out as welcome lately. Oh, they're putting out all these games and not the games people want. Kingdom Hearts has been in limited supply, so people are still into it. Well, no, it's the same thing with Kingdom Hearts. They're putting out all these games and they're not the ones people want. Yeah, but the core core Kingdom Hearts games are the ones people want.

I know like so many people enjoy them and the handful of them that I've played. I, I do like them. It's just I want the story to progress and it not just be like retreading similar ideas in the same worlds and stuff just to like oh this one's a dream and oh this one's a card game and it's like okay give me the new stuff. Yeah, I think they finally got the message but I think they got the message too late and so that's why I don't think the game comes out this year. It would be incredible if a game of that scope you assume could be done this quickly by a team that is working on another game. Yeah, make any sense. All right, next up guys, Game Changer.

And that's the weirdest thing is I remember back in the day arcades were a big deal. That was the experience. That was the marquee experience. It's like what I'm always talking about with the movies, right? They'll be around. It'll just be different experiences there. Exactly. And it's, you know, especially there was in the early 90s arcades were huge and then they kind of dipped off a bit, but then there was like a resurgence with the peripherals with Dance Dance Revolution, Time Crisis, um the skateboarding game where we actually stand on the skateboard. I forgot what that was called. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater or something like that.",

The boxing game before Wii and all that stuff those were stuff that were worth the dollar, you know. Um but now it's like all right, you know those games that you play on your your iPhone all day, you get to pay to play them here. Right. Right. Right. I used to pay to play them on your phone too, but sure. But once usually and it's over. The thing is, you know, we this all started from what I've seen with Guitar Hero. Like the moment I saw Guitar Hero in arcades, I was like, \"All right.\" I mean, GuitarFreaks, that's been in there.",

But even I think Guitar Hero makes sense because there's a barrier to entry. You hear about Guitar Hero, you see somebody playing Guitar Hero, you're like, \"I'd love to try Guitar Hero.\" You can go out and do it there, right? But Flappy Birds, like the 99 cent investment you should have made when it was out. Guitar Hero when it got to arcades it was Guitar Hero 3. Yeah. So it's like you played it. You played it. You played it by now. So that was the beginning of the end. Well, arcades ended, but that was like just the sign of like, all right, this is uh not going to go well for the most interesting arcade game I've seen in years was the Star Wars Battle Pod we saw at New York Comic-Con where you got in and it's like",

But when yeah, you walk in, it's just one big button for doodle jam. Like what the hell am I doing? Yeah, I think I think this shows this kind of thing shows just the the lack of viability of an arcade generally that big publishers and developers have no interest with exception Bandai Namco making that game uh of making new arcade games. Arcades are even closing, prominent arcades even in Japan are closing and it's rare to see there's great places that have old arcade games",

But in other words, for places that still somehow are holding on like Dave & Buster's, that's what they have to do. They're not going to get new games from any any worthwhile publishers developers. So, they have to go into these weird directions that are easily recognizable by people on dates in their early 20s and oh, you know, this is but like it's just it's just another death throw of this of this of this of this industry, you know. But it's I was recently we were in LA and we went to a Dave & Buster's and it was just like walking into a a physical retail app store. Yeah. And it's just nuts.

So, we got two more quick things. Okay. One, GTA V PC version delayed to March 24th from January 27th. Sort it out. They say, \"I apologize for the slight shift in the date, but the game requires a few extra weeks of testing and polish to make it as good as it can be.\" Moving a release date is never a decision we take lightly and a choice we only make when we know it's the best in the best interest of the game and our fans. Thanks everyone for your understanding and we assure you these few extra weeks will be worth it when the game does arrive in March. Good on them. Yeah, of course.

And then like to see people flipping out, I'm like, are really it was are are this many of the people who who are flipping out on Twitter really going to play this? Like you know what I mean? Like I know that there's a huge PC mod community, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that there aren't PC players, but I was seeing people I know who are heavily leaning console people like, \"Oh my god, it's like seems like you're just reacting.\" It's the internet.

And I'm sure they'll still have a patch, but uh it's nice to see that they're taking the extra time and I can't imagine how tired that team is. Uh but like you know just working on that game over and over again forever. Uh but yeah, with it's important that they get the PC port right because it's the one that's going to live the longest and so um for sure. Um so it's really really essential that they they they get it right with that and I think they know that that PC gamers are I think the hardest to please. Um that's nothing wrong with that.

Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes got a first-person mod last week. What was that noise? And uh you just played the whole the whole game in first person and it just changed how the whole thing works and all that stuff and I just love that. I love that. And that you know people were really into it. People liked it and enjoyed it a lot. That's awesome that you can just take a game and completely change the perspective. It's cool.

Like you know what I mean? Like it's first person's a perspective that was designed to immerse you and make you feel like you maybe are that character or you're seeing through that character's eyes.

Those are those there's games like that that are cinematic experiences that Uncharted Last of Us that I want I don't want to be ever try to be I'd honestly probably love Call of Duty way more if it if the story mode was, you know, if the campaign was third person because first person does lose me a lot. I I have a really hard time connecting with first person games. Now, something cool to think about here though is first person was added to GTA 5, right? So now the mods are going to be able to do first person GTA mods and stuff. So that it's going to be it's going to be pretty interesting. You going to play it? No. No, of course not.
