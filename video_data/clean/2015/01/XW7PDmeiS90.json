You do, but you've already used so many of them, and it only uses one bar. Okay, this is a super overpowered ridiculous one. So, every stage, do you just recharge or does it recharge after every stage, or when you lose all your lives? Okay, cool. Except for in Wily's Castle, it doesn't recharge; you have to recharge yourself. I'm liking this sort of uh forest green character is right; yeah, he's far as green because for some reason that's what Metal Man's weapon is. Go down to the next part okay down here.
