I coined \"bro shooter\" and coined \"bro shooter.\" You're going to take credit for it? I'm definitely taking credit for bro shooter, and I'm taking real credit, not fake credit like I was taking credit for \"broch shooter.\" I'm gonna take real credit for whatever the hell that is I just said. But uh, Shovel Knight is gameplay gameplay is king, and it hearkens back to these NES days, these pure gameplay days where there was limited tools for the developers to use, limited art assets, hex graphics, uh, parallax scrolling, all this weird stuff that like you really need to have a great 8-bit side scroller or it could be a 16-bit side scroller or whatever, but Sid.",

Exactly, this game just plays like a dream; it's part Capcom's DuckTales, it's part Zelda II, it's part Mario III, it's part Mega Man II, it's part Ninja Gaiden, it's part Castlevania. There's a lot of great and known and and the weird thing about that is that it's not those aren't just throwaway games; those are all fantastic games. If you were to make a list of the top 20 NES games, every one of those games would be on that list: all three Ninja Gaiden, all six Mega Man, all three Castlevania, Zelda II, DuckTales \u2013 they're so good. They didn't just be like we're going to borrow a little bit from Metal Storm; we're going to borrow a little bit from Faxanadu, do a little bit, but not just these regular games, so it was really special.",

But like South Park did it by first off, having the game look like the show, and that's what's crazy. I remember a long time ago playing Simpsons Wrestling on the PS1, and being like, \"This looks just like the show.\" It was like, \"Was I stupid?\" No, it didn't - it was horrible. But looking at South Park, I showed my brother, and he actually thought it was South Park right, until you see the... like, once the HUD pops up, yeah. But like when you're actually playing it, and then jumping into it, and the fact that it's... I think Ryan McCaffrey always says that it's like the next season - it's like this entire season's long story, and it is. And I love that, and I always think it gets a bad rap from people of like, \"Oh, sure, but I don't like South Park.\"",

I haven't watched South Park regularly uh since 2001 maybe yeah 2001. So and I've seen maybe a handful of episodes at all since then they're amazing always, it and it is a great show. I never had a problem with it, it's like I I I authentically don't like The Simpsons for instance, like I actually don't like that show, and like sorry to be up front but like South Park was just one of those things where I'm like God I'm just you know I'm not into it anymore. It's it's fine, it's funny they're very funny characters and great writing, and fine it's fine South Park, and uh it's not your thing, it it made me laugh out loud, it made me like laugh from my stomach like that game, I don't think A Game's ever made me laugh more than",

It wasn't like I broke the game, but I loved it. And I'll tell you guys this two things about this game: one is that I hope that they do another one, and I think Obsidian's capable of doing another one. I think that money was made on this game; I think it it surprised a lot of people, certainly charted on MPD extra costs were involved with developing for such a long time, obviously it was in it was in um a series in limbo, yeah, in development hell literally for a while when THQ went down.

I know doing a sequel though, the problem with that right is the fact that it was Matt and Trey who, like, I mean they're the reason it's so funny is that they were so hands-on with it. I remember doing the Comic-Con panel with them where they're making jokes about never wanting to do it again, but there is a lot of truth to that because you know how crazy their process is to make an episode of South Park; a game was even worse, right? Them doing this all these voices, this and that, and the other. I don't think you'll ever get them to do it again. Yeah, maybe maybe not.

I didn't burn out, I don't look back at it and think like you know how so many games end with such a **** boss fight battle, I don't look back that's not my memory, my memory is playing through and my dad's voice swinging above me as he was having sex with...

And but Melee had the Adventure Mode which was that minus the cut scenes but the gameplay was better than the Adventure Mode they just gave up in this one, there isn't a single-player yeah and that's I think that's a problem because I I think that you know there's a few things that are clear with this game it's it's it's going to be a huge hit for Nintendo and stuff like that but it's not going to push an astronomical amount of Wii U so this is going to be uh a game that is out there",

We went to Missouri and so what we would do because we're on vacation is wake up go to a night's breakfast or lunch or whatever then go to a coffee shop and spend three hours at the coffee shop playing War local on ad hoc, and total nerds who did it on the plane when I went to a PlayStation Experience. I had that little meet-up right like it's... I love those kind of games. Freedom Wars definitely scratched the itch I have had on the Vita for the longest time - I want a world to get invested in, not have a story I have to really keep up with and level just go level things up and get more powerful and take on bigger enemies and you know it's the Monster Hunter vibe right but in a contemporary setting if not a little bit far-flung future right.

The fact that you're fighting giant monsters in the city and all this stuff - it's like Monster Hunter again getting too high fantasy for me with your God-like dragons. I don't know what to do with yeah. And I think the final game that I would want to mention, I mean there's a lot of games that I played this year that I really enjoyed, but um Valiant Hearts, I think is still on my list, but yes uh Valiant Hearts is a special game and um surprised people didn't like it more. But yeah, World War I is an interesting thing to cover from a narrative standpoint because it's such a brutal and bloody war and really a pointless war right? Um and it was a war that was really the transition between not Antiquity but kind of more of a Victorian kind of f to war to a more industrial",

That I mean that was what was so great about Valiant Hearts is getting out introducing all these characters separating them on different sides of the you know the conflict or whatever and making you care about all of them and having that great narration. You know I mean like it was funny like I remember when the E3 trailer dropped right getting teared up watching it, and then not even at the first time putting it all together that it was the dog talking you know what I mean, and at the end when I did really get choked up, and then to play that game and have that moment like that stretched out the entire game where I cared, I was on the edge of my seat about what's going to happen to these people, and you're doing like cutesy goofy puzzles but you're doing it through like all right there's this gas that's",

I want to say got more and again these are just now I'm we're just giving shout outs here. I'm not saying games that came out in 2014, Destiny - that's what I wanted to throw out, it's Destiny, again for all of its problems and I think so much fun, fun to play. Another game that I've had so much fun playing is the perfect game for streaming when I get to stream that and have somebody in the group and do all these different things and it's it's it's basically my why I love Freedom Wars on the PS4 right. I don't have to think about the story, I'm leveling up, I'm making progress. It's like DC Universe Online in the same way right, I'm doing all except I love everything about DC Universe Online but you know you're going through doing all these different things",

I also want to say that \"Chaos of Light\" is overrated; you're crazy, damn it! We'll leave that for another day. You're out of your mind rolling that one out there. Round Zeroes come out this year, yeah, yeah. I liked that, definitely not Game of the Year, but your shout-out material, favorite two hours of the year, yeah, maybe your favorite two hours, favorite two... I mean, I enjoyed it so much like I knew I was going to enjoy it, but I didn't think I was going to enjoy it that much. My here's my problem with Ground Zeroes is that in it's something I when we we talked about quitting IGN and when we're going to have all this free time, we'll stream all the time.
