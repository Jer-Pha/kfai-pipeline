This question is from Manny SJ also from the Kinda Funny forums: \"Hey guys, this is a rather broad question, but why do you guys play video games with more content out there than ever? What is it about gaming that keeps you coming back?\" I mean, I play games 'cause they're fun. I feel like that's such a generic answer, but it's your preferred method of entertainment, man.

It's just they're cool. Yeah, for me, I think I've always been a fan of just media in general, whether it was audio or video, and all this stuff. I love all of it, and games are kind of just all of that together plus an interactive element. And I think it's just like that is what really makes it cool is you're a part of it, and you get to do stuff, and it's designed around it. It's controlled; it's designed for you to basically have it center around you without you, it is useless. Right? Whereas, and that is why they call it a very active experience.

Bringing them back, not the old ones, but why they're not doing new ones. So Front Mission is a really egregious one to me because of what they're doing to that series, which is so disappointing - they're turning them into like Armored Core games, which is not Front Mission. Which started on Super Famicom and we finally got the original one on DS, which is a great game. It's a really deep strategy role-playing game, like deeper than Tactics Ogre or Final Fantasy Tactics. You use mechs and you equip your mech with a bunch of different stuff and your player also has like statistics. It's a fantastic game, and it's just... it's a little I don't",

And I think they just were like well we can make it very Western and so they ruined that series. Uh Xenogears, I don't know. I mean Xenogears is an interesting game that a lot of people like. But Xenogears was clearly rushed at the end and I'm not so sure what the legacy of that game is internally at Square. Um if they have any interest in bringing that game back. Secret of Mana and secret, I mean Secret of Mana did come back. I mean there was another Secret of Man game, I think wasn't it on PS2? Secret PS1 wasn't there was that Secret of Evermore no. Secret of Evermore is an SNES game that was an N64 game that Square now owns. Secret Evermore is a great game too. Um but I feel",

Secret Evermore is a great game too, but I feel like Mana did come back - Legend of Mana, that series did come back. So I don't know. Oh, you're right. Yeah, um... so why do they not do these things? I think there's just a balance - they have to focus on their tentpole series, well, Eastern series: Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest in there, and they're going to continue to focus on those. They're also doing Star Ocean, which is like an A-tier, not AAA, but A-tier thing that I think they're kind of throwing around because I'd love to see them bring back Brave Fencer Musashi, I'd love to see them bring back The Bouncer and stuff like that, but they're just not going to.

There's Xeno Gears and then there was Xenosaga, right? One, two, and three, yeah, on PS2, right? Right, are those connected? I don't know because I didn't play them. I played I bought Xenosaga, which had some German name, I don't remember it was like some ridiculous name... oh yeah, and uh, I played it, and I bought it so I bought it when I was in college, I think it was a freshman in college, and I put it in and it was like an hour later and like I still couldn't play it.

I don't know if they're necessarily connected because then there's like you know not that it comes from the same company but you know there's a lot of Xeno... well, Xenoblade is the same now. No, they're not; they're not related. Xenoblade is just Xenoblade. I mean, yeah, I mean that's the thing: you have to look up the Xenoblade logo. I'll never forget getting Xenogears in '98 - man, I got it for Christmas. It was uh... Define Xenoblade interesting game. Xenoblade Define. I'm proud of myself that I knew it was a Final Fantasy Versus XIII-like experience. The final question of the day from James Tam is: why has Nintendo dropped the ball so hard on Virtual Console?

And but again, I think that there's just reasons for this that we don't quite understand, um, because when you look at it in its base form on Virtual Console on Wii, not Wii U, just the Wii, it's awesome. Like the Virtual Console is great. I mean, that was the best thing about the Wii; it's the best thing about the Wii years for it to be great now looking back, it is. I guess so. I mean, I, I, I again, I feel like Nintendo rolled a lot of their stuff onto the console pretty quickly.

There's a lot of semantics that I think a lot of people don't look into, so you know I'm surprised that we actually got the amount of games that we did. Because if I was Konami and I was releasing these Castlevania games for instance, I would have been like \"We'll put them all on a disc and sell them for $60.\" We're not putting them on Virtual Console, yeah you know. And they instead just released some peace meal and made last money. So you can almost look at it from the other point of view, yeah. I mean I'm just shocked that Super Mario World is Not on 3DS. They might have a plan to roll those super Super Nintendo games out and make a big event out of it, but there there must be... I mean the only Virtual Console games I played are NES games.
