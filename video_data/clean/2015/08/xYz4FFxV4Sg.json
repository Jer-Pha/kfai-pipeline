This is going to be an interesting topic because I feel like Nick's gonna have a lot of opinions on it. But the reason I bring it up is this weekend or last couple days, uh, I've been staying with my girlfriend and at her her parents' house, and her little sister is addicted to The Bachelorette. Oh Jesus, that show is like totally fake. I mean, that's the thing - I'm watching it, and it's like holy **** how could anyone like this? This doesn't make sense. It's all super contrived romance speeches that the entire show is two... it's a two-camera thing of just them going back having a **** conversation. I guess I can't really hate that too much, no. But there's a but - and you can look at the way they're actually marketing these as far as the award ceremonies are concerned. Right, there's reality now, there's a bunch of different",

But what's awesome about it is The Bachelor, for example, has all these rules, like when you're supposed to go on these dates, you're supposed to do this, and whatever. And people get eliminated if they don't have a date. Like, it's all based on hooking up; it's strategic hooking up with everybody. So it's like it totally goes away from the premise of the other ****. It's just like **** everybody. And where it gets really interesting is if you're not **** someone, you get the goddamn boot: you get you're done, you're booted.

Yeah, Joe Millionaire was the funniest thing ever. I watched that with my mom actually when I was in college. I would like go to her house on Sundays or Wednesday or something, I'd sleep over at that house so we could just watch Joe Millionaire together. All right, so here's the thing.

Survivor was around, yeah, Survival was the one that really started and still going on, and then Big Brother came out and The Amazing Race came out - it's really CBS actually because these are almost all CBS shows that really started to figure it out, and they probably deserve a lot of credit, and people probably made a lot of money there.

Right, and I'm sure there was a fair amount of editing happening no matter what you're still needing to tell you're still trying to find a narrative somewhere in there because even documentaries have narratives you're still telling a story.

They had to do anything, remember? Because they had to work right; they had to do stuff. And then eventually, they're like, \"Just put him in a hotel in Vegas and let him ****.\" Um, but then somewhere along the lines, uh, reality just became about following people's lives that are better than you, and that's where I feel like it kind of took a turn for the worst. Whereas, like you bring up Bravo; well, uh, Bravo has The Real Housewives right, and they're just fascinating human beings from one standpoint: most of them are very smart, a lot of them are self-made; um, they're their characters in their own right, but they represent just a lot of the horrible things that are wrong with society today.",

There are like a few sitcoms; meanwhile, like every day on all of the channels were sitcoms you know in like 1990 and now like every day on all the channels there are reality shows. So it's just the lean flow. The unfortunate thing I think is that you know we disparage it and we kind of make fun of it a little bit, but what we do is also very similar to what they do. I mean especially the social media aspects; and like you think about it who are the most popular YouTubers vloggers? It's people that are literally",
