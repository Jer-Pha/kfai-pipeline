And uh this is our fourth, fifth VidCon, something like that. One of the two. And uh we've seen it kind of evolve from being a really weird thing to a much bigger really weird thing. Sure. Now, VidCon's always been interesting to me because there's two extreme sides to it. Explain what VidCon is. Yeah. All right. VidCon is essentially the E3 for YouTube stuff. YouTube stars, YouTube making its own announcements of like new stuff for its platform and all that. But you said something really interesting to me that it's not so much the E3, it's more the GDC of the YouTube world, right? It's a game which is the Game Developers Conference but the idea is that people who make content out on their own in these different groups come together to share knowledge and be like hey they give panels at VidCon saying like here's how a better way to monetize here's how to",

And then the third level is for the much bigger people to industry people to learn how to do to make more money on what they're doing or to find out what's the next big thing. Like everyone's talking about Snapchat which is like at this point like a year old and all the kids are using it. But it's like here's how you should use it for your stuff or Periscope or god knows whatever else they're pushing now. But um it's interesting because there's this really wide gamut of different types of people there for different reasons. Now, we started there with IGN, which was like we kind of came in at the top level, but we as Kinda Funny were at the bottom. So, I feel like over the last couple years, we've kind of like met in the middle somewhere, right? And weirdly ended up on",

So, we were telling people how to integrate brands into their content and stuff, which is just ridiculous that people actually cared. We had a packed room. We did have a really impactful room. That was a fascinating thing. When we came in at VidCon, we came in thinking um, and this was largely me as well as everyone else, but came in kind of assuming that we weren't going to learn anything and I came in assuming, this is not a compliment for myself, that I knew everything and what was this VidCon thing going to teach me that I, at IGN being a senior video producer at IGN who had built this giant team and",

There are a bunch of individual contributors that have these gigantic audiences that have nothing to do with that and don't want to be necessarily be a part of that world. They have their own thing going on. And so that was really eye opening. So when we went there first when you when you talk about evening out that's how it's sort of been for me is letting go of all those expectations and that ego of working at a place like IGN and really starting from grassroots and forming our own um audience and then meeting on that level which I feel like we were for the",

Um, what's amazing though is there is a very big line between those fans and the professionals and you can see that at the Hilton bar which is like there's a there's a bar at the Hilton which is right by the convention center and all of the industry goes there if you're over 21 and you have a cocktail and you can meet but then on the outside of it is everyone that's underage that's just waiting to fanboy out about like to see someone and scream real quick.

Even they might not be getting drinks, but they'll be sitting at the like different the tables or just standing around talking to people. Like they know that they're allowed in. It's these people the people on the outside are the ones that are scared to go in because they feel like they want a selfie and an autograph. They just want a selfie and autograph and they're scared to like kind of breach that thing because they feel like they're not going to be included. They'll be like spotted immediately as like not part of the the crowd, right? Even though it's totally not true. No one knows who anyone is. I wouldn't be able to spot anyone.

Yeah. So, it's and it's on one level I'm like, \"Where are all your parents that are letting you in this hotel till 1:00 in the morning screaming and following these YouTube celebrities up to their rooms?\" Like, cuz they'll post when we stayed at the Hilton, um they would literally post people on floors and they would text each other like where people were. They'd figure out what your room was and they'd like follow YouTube people back to their rooms. Um not us because we're all That's not creepy. It's it's it's really weird.

I can't remember the name of the kid, but he went there incognito because he wanted to look around and like check things out, but didn't want to be mobbed, but somebody spotted him and it turned into a scene from like a Hard Day's Night, you know, like The Beatles are like running from these. That's really what it I mean, and I some of the some of the footage I've seen, I mean, it really is like nothing like nothing I've ever seen since like The Beatles came to America, like teenage girls tearing their hair out.

I think this year I didn't see it that much. No, the the running and the crazy screaming and all that, but I think that's because VidCon is finally kind of uh they're getting smarter. Getting smarter and they're growing to learn how to understand. So, their signing process was a lot better this year. So, they actually like scheduled a lot more people and they had a structure to waiting in line to be able to guarantee that these people can meet the people they're looking forward to meeting. And that's kind of what my topic was is I'm watching these people wait in line to go say hi and like meet and greet these, you know, YouTube celebrities or not even they're not even saying YouTube's not even fair cuz it's like there's Vine celebrities and Instagram people and",

There you go. Snappers. Snappers. Yeah, they're chatters. And uh yes uh the chat roulette people. Um, it's crazy to me that there's people that would wait for 4 hours to be able to take a picture with someone and say hi. But then I stopped and think about it and I was like, did I ever do that for people? And then I was like, I did like back in the day I would like I remember my brother was super into WWE and like when people would come like we'd wait I'd bring him and wait in line for hours to meet these wrestlers and like that didn't seem ridiculous to me, you know?

And this is where we start to realize that we're basically turning into dads where you're looking at what, you know, teenagers are into and going, I don't get it. When I was a kid in the early '80s, I would watch, I don't know if it was everything here, but in the UK, we had a show called The Young Ones, which is kind of an anarchic comedy show. I think MTV had it here for a while, and it was like very much at the forefront of like very kind of gross out, just silly slapstick comedy. And it was a huge hit on BBC television. And it's very very popular with like kids of my age, like teenagers. And my dad would look at it and go, I don't get it at all. And you eventually become that person looking at the",

And you know, I look at they don't look at the TV. They they're watching YouTube on their iPads. That's their television now. And they show they show me these these these characters, these kids that are doing this stuff. What I've noticed as well is if you look at the kind of content that I'm trying been trying to educate myself about this I I did a show I did a YouTube show last year with Skybound. I was so I was trying to figure out like who the audience was and trying to learn like how long the show has to be and who the audience is for this thing. What was that? What was called NerdCore?

It was good. Yeah, it was really good. It was good. People should check out that episode. I think it was episode five, Mario vs Sonic. Yep. You had the Warp Zone. We had We had You did the Mario Brother Super Show dance routine at the end, which is amazing. Anyway, you look I was talking to someone about this and said, \"So, okay. So, what kind of content is on there?\" I said, \"Well, like some of the really popular ones are like the teenage girl who like does makeup tips or like here's dating tips for girls and like here's, you know, fashion stuff and you know, here's like celebrity gossip.\" And what I realized is that this",

And I think that's what the kids now have instead. But with this added dimension of like some level of interactivity where you know they these YouTube stars can do videos going hey you know I like your comments whatever you feel like you can kind of this is why I think it's so virulent is that sense that like you kind of know them a little bit and you're like internet friends with these people because the two-way communication allows that is that people get really really into it um in a in a way that I think transcends anything we we saw in you know television or any of the old media.

Well, I think it's one of those things also, the reason a lot of us, myself included, don't necessarily understand or have a full grasp of it is how quickly it moves. And and like I said, when we when we went there four years ago, I kind of had a firm in my brain, I had a firm understanding of what a celebrity or a star was versus what someone on the internet was, right? I'm like, \"No, these people aren't stars. Four years ago, I would have told you that they're not stars. No way. These aren't stars.\" But then you start to break it down. You're like, \"Well, what does that mean?\" Well, all of them have a huge audience. All of them are treated like stars when their when their their fans see them. like they're they want to elevate them to that status and",

So yes, by by any by definition, these guys are every bit as successful and should be sort of seen in that light. And I think you nailed it. I think you you you nailed it when you said the reason that I think they're seen in a little bit differently is because that you're able to have that conversation with them and feel like they are are there is no barrier really uh between you and them. There's a there's a there's an added level of intimacy. Yeah. even with a ma even with a massive audience that you don't get yeah with television and and again like the crazy thing is these people are earning real real money I mean you know you've got PewDiePie at the top of the was it like 7.5 million he pulled in last year you've got like these the girls I mentioned",

They started the panel started going from like how to grow your audience and how to like what what monetization means to we started seeing panels of like what does representation mean?

Um, and I think to to a lesser extent, you know, it's it's true of, you know, people in the entertainment business. They don't necessarily have to understand it in order to package it and monetize it. There's a again, we see this all the time. I there's a there was a British YouTube celebrity, I don't",

She now has a she had like has like a bestselling book in the UK, Zoella. Z\u00f6e Sugg (also known as Zoella) is correct based on context. Ghostritten, but nobody cares. It was you, well, this is like and again, you don't Here's the thing. Part of the reason why there's a rush to monetize this is that nobody really knows how long it's going to last. So some of these YouTube celebrities could have very short, you know, lifespans. We we now live in a world where one of the dominant forms of media is 6 seconds long. So you want to talk about like the contraction of attention spans and how long you might have in the spotlight before the next cool kid comes along.

And I a couple years ago at VidCon, we saw this whole thing Nick's talking about where it's like representation and all this. And you started to see the beginning of like what happened with all the boy bands and stuff where it's just this produced thing where people put people together and like made a product out of these people and kind of sold it that way. You started seeing a bunch of YouTube networks and channels and shows and whatever, and personalities that weren't really personalities. It's not like they came up doing YouTube channels.

And what's interesting now is I mean there's a ton of those that just exist and they keep going. But this year I saw a bunch of those people that were introduced a couple years ago and they've now been pretty much saying you and just doing their own thing. And it's like they got brought up that way, but then they learned quickly. And I think that's the the most interesting part of this is even with all these young kids, they're not only are they getting a lot more money a lot earlier and having a lot more weird responsibilities, they're given the opportunity to think and use them, use all the tools available to them in such unique weird ways that they can kind of say, \"We don't need you.

That's that's the power of it, right? Is that before, prior to this, you needed a label or studio to elevate you as a celebrity, right? And you needed their continual support in order to keep your celebrity. Whereas now, the dangerous thing is if you build up a bunch of people who get massive followings, they don't necessarily need to stay within your organization, they can go out on their own, do their own thing, and still enjoy success and still thrive.

I think there's a whole new generation of that waiting to happen with like 14, 15, 16 year old boys and girls who, you know, just started doing YouTube. And a lot of these kids didn't get in this to become famous. They just did it because it was a hobby. Next thing you know, CIA's call and you've got 100,000 subscribers and there's real money coming in and, you know, there's book deals and you go to VidCon, you've got girls chasing you down.

It's a very easy, very difficult thing to keep straight in your head and suddenly this overnight celebrity and like how does that not go bad? And we again we've seen it ever since the golden age of Hollywood child stars that kind of went off the rails because they just weren't properly prepared or properly protected by those around them. And I wonder if there is a new generation. I think there already is a new generation that we've seen in the last couple years and that's the viral hit. like people that just make one video, they get millions of views and they get millions of fans and stuff for that one video and then nothing after that, right?

If you watch it again, sometimes if it's like a show that I remember when um the series finale of Breaking Bad was on and we were like, \"Okay, I'm not leaving anything to chance. I'm watching it straight up live with everyone else so that no one can spoil me.\" But then there are commercials and you're like, \"Huh? What am I supposed to do now? Am I supposed to sit and watch these?\" Like, is that so uncomfortable? It's such a weirdly outdated model. I had the same thing happen last like two nights ago. I came home, my wife was watching Total Divas. Now, I love Total Divas. Who doesn't love Total Divas? And I love it for a number of reasons. One, it's just good old-fashioned TV. And two, the women are just gorgeous. And so, my wife's watching it. What is Total Divas? It's the reality show on VH1 - that's the divas from WWE.",

My wife realizes that too, but she still gets sucked into it as do I. I'll be honest. And it was the same thing where she was watching it and I kept picking up the remote during commercials and hitting the fast forward and coming to the realization every time that we were live. Oh, when you hit fast forward, you realize there's nowhere to go. You can't actually travel forward in time or terrifying.

I like creating that buffer of removing commercials. It's just the way we digest content now. There's the expectations are different.

Oh yeah, the iPad like propped up behind the Surface. That was good. That is hilarious. So I think it's only going to get until it just craters and then people are like this is not it'll it'll fold in on itself eventually. You've got you've got services like Netflix and HBO now which is like done standalone HBO. So that's what's happening is that because now we have all this technology to skip through shows.

Before we move on to the next topic, last thing I want to say, YouTube is growing so fast that this last year at VidCon there was a huge deal about Smosh. Like during the keynote, they said this that Smosh hit 10 million subscribers, right? So, I was looking. Sorry. I saw a thing last night on Netflix, Smosh: The Movie, and I guess these guys came out last night. They have a movie now. I never know who \"they\" are. Yeah. Well, they were nice guys. They're nice guys. They've been the longest running number one subscribe channel on YouTube. Like, if you count up, they're all two comedy guys. They're just two guys.",

They do a whole bunch of stuff now, but they've been doing it since the very beginning. Um, but they hit 10 million subscribers last year at VidCon. That was a huge deal because it happened like that week and they were the number one most subscribed channel. Since then, PewDiePie outpaced them and PewDiePie's now at 38 million. Jesus. Since a year ago, PewDiePie has gone beyond Smosh to 38 million. So, you're saying there's 28 million? Yeah. So that's like 500,000 that's like 550,000 subscribers a week, right? Yeah.
