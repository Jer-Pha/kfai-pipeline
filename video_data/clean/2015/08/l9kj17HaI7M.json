I'm going back to I'm going back to this. You're going back to back to the Mite. Okay, it's just something about it. It's bold. I think. I mean I agree that it is not as offensive as Vienetta but I find it's similar very similar because I think it's the same kind of product right? Yeah, it's not Ty not not terribly different.

These are absolute staples \u2013 like you would find these in almost any British cupboard. So, peanut butter and jelly or something like that. I would say... I wouldn't necessarily say go that far. No, nothing is comparable to peanut butter and J, but I'm saying in terms of ubiquity. But both of these, even within the you know British society, there are people that just can't stand either one of these things.

F, and it just adds just enough of a little kind of zing to the spaghetti sauce. Fantastic! I'm going... I might try that. It's great for, I mean you know putting it on toast is like kind of the root one way to eat it, but you can basically just take a little bit of it. You know, it comes it's like a very, very thick syrupy kind of paste, but put it in a sauce, put it in gravy or whatever and it will melt down and mingle and and mix with the sauce, and you... you can feel how sharp the taste is right?
