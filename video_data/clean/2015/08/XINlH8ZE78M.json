Now here's my here's where this comes down to is that I feel like there's a ton of movies that are set in high school that always make me go, oh man, I'm nostalgic for wait, I don't like high school. I I find American Pie, yeah, American Pie, The Duff recently, that John Tucker Must Die movie, like it's all these things of like you're hanging out with your friends and you're doing like I hang out with you idiots every day and it's great but it's not like that and it's and I don't know if it ever like even when we sit there and I'll tell you my Smash Brothers when we had the Smash Brothers championship and we all played at a Michael Bay's house and we lived there every weekend or whatever, like those were great.",

Yeah, of course, John Hughes - the John Hughes films, like \"The Breakfast Club\" uh uh, \"Sixteen Candles\". The thing is, like I don't know what's weird for me is that I feel like I understand why so many movies happen in high school because I remember in high school you went to the movies on the weekend. It's where you could all go and congregate and not have it be weird that you're all there with 30 people at somebody's house or whatever when their parents are trying to get something done. But you go to the movies and you're there, so they make a high school drama to get the high school crowd or whatever - a high school movie to get kids to come see it to spend their money and da what's weird is that I still connect with",

My worst heartbreak was in college when my girlfriend senior year broke up with me. That we were together like throughout college. That was **** awful. Yeah, you know that was like my the lowest point in my entire life. I was despondent, you know what I mean, like for like a long time, you know. And and I look back at that time and I'm like learn from it, you know, just like you learned from the classroom, learn from these different experiences so you don't.",

I would I would be nodding constantly to people, everyone knew me, nobody thought I was the king **** of anything but everyone was like that's Nick whatever, and that was a good feeling. I get to college and I think it was largely because I was very lazy in college because really every situation is what you make of it right.
