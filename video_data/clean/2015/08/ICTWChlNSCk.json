    "description": "Screw missions; Konami's Robert Peeler and Greg screw around on Mother Base and get D-Dog! NOTE: We open with cutscenes. They're not HUGE SPOILERS, but I know some of you are skittish.\n\nABOUT SPOILERS: Hey! It's me, Greg. I've played 60 hours of MGSV. Nothing in these early let's plays will spoil the story. Yes, you will now know how missions begin and story elements, but the fun in MGSV is tackling these situations how you want to. Plus, the story elements you'll see here have been in trailers. I love the Metal gear franchise, and I wouldn't ruin it for you. Also, I know you're better than I am at MGS, so don't bother saying it in the comments. ;)\n\nSubscribe! https://www.youtube.com/user/kindafunnygames?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCome discuss MGS V on our forum: http://kindafunnyforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=3799\n\nThis video was edited on an ORIGIN PC EVO15-S Laptop.
