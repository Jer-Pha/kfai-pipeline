So Colin, once again we have a lot of talks about video games even when we're not on camera, it's shocking I know, but we were talking about the pricing of digital games. Games and I was telling you that we get a lot of a lot of messages from users that they want us to talk about how come digital games are priced at the same price point as retail games. Retail games drop their price, digital games usually don't unless they're on flash sales or you know um PS+ and all that stuff. What are your thoughts on this? The simplest answer I mean Greg and I have been talking about this for a long time. The simplest answer is that they have to play nice with their retail partners GameStop, Walmart uh you can't they understand the public. Publishers and the first parties understand that they could cut $5 or $20 off of a triple-A game and make the same amount of money in terms of like their own their own rip on it because they don't have to.",

The reason they don't do that is because if they **** the retailers then there's no way to sell the hardware which cannot be uh available digitally. In other words, they don't want to make Walmart angry at them, they don't want to make GameStop angry at them. That is certainly although they wouldn't come out and say that has to be the answer. And it's and it's you can't go you know hat in hand to GameStop if you're Sony for instance be like we need you to sell PlayStation 4s and it's really important that you sell PlayStation 4s exactly and we need shelf space, we need this amount of space and you can have all these games too and they're like but your",

And they're like, \"But your games are cheaper by 20% on your console.\" Like that's just the way it is, you know? Then they're going to be like, \"Well, Xbox, go to the back of the store.\" You go to the back if we even cover you, yeah. So it's it's it seems weird to a lot of people, but that is certainly part of the calculus until they get to a position where they're totally comfortable and maybe even comfortable with their retail partners also being comfortable in the digital space. They can't undercut them. I think the only major handheld or system that did make their digital game cheaper was Vita, yep. And that worked out well. So yeah, I mean it's certainly you know it was interesting, I was excited to see that because I thought maybe it was a sign of what was to come with PlayStation 4 but",

The brilliance of it though is that you know there is a middle ground to be explored with the games that are not retail, where they're cheaper and also they don't go on sale maybe necessarily very often if they're new on PSN or Xbox Live, but a lot of these games are significantly discounted later on more significant than you would find them in a store. So if you're patient, the digital storefront is where you need to be. But I don't think that they want to they don't want to mess around with their retail partners because it's it hurts the hardware business and without the hardware there are no games. Yeah, I mean it's you know it's no mystery as to why you see these summer sales pop up and have all these games that are old right because there is",
