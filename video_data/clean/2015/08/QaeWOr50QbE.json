Jet Man and um I was oh I was competent at a couple of the games pretty terrible at most of those early PC you know those those like Commodore games or whatever the **** you know they were running on at the time uh not my finest moment but we went through each game, we only played each for like two or three minutes at the most. Then uh the NES ones we played Slalom which I wasn't very good at RC ProAm which I wasn't very good at what was I good at I don't even know I don't remember I was I was okay at uh Cobra Triangle Snake Rattle and Roll was okay Gun Fight is that what it's called?

Shots where they take bits of the game, like the bit that everyone thinks of with that game, and they have you play through it. And they'll kind of change up the mode for example in Battletoads, the one of the Snapshots is the Speeder Bike level but it's uh more of an endless Runner instead of a level you can actually be so it's more of a face off against your friends see how far you can get.

I mean, no, because Super Mario All-Stars exists, but it's damn good. And I think what's really cool about it is... I'm saying this not even based solely on the quality of the games - like, the games that we played, they weren't good, most of them. Yeah, if any of them, well, some of the NES ones were good, but like, the um, the pre-NES games - I mean, they were distracting, if anything. Like, there was so much color and it wasn't even music; it was just sounds. It was like... what did I describe it as? Just a coughing of noise, and just... it was very colorful.

I don't care about like the things they're making now which just like they're not going to recapture this essence because none of those people are here anymore so they're working on you know ukulele and all these other games, so I I really appreciate that.

It wasn't anywhere near on the level of Rare Replay in terms of its talk explain what Rare Replay, but but I thought that that was really cool because that did celebrate you know we make fun of Genesis you know, but it's or at least I do, but it's there are good games on it and it's and some some of those games I never played sucked me in, some of those other games that I remember more fondly like Conic Zone, I played, I was like Jesus Christ really not good um at all um, but it was cool to be able to celebrate a lineage of of a piece of Hardware like that just like Microsoft celebrated the lineage of a specific developer.

I think it'll be a lot of fun so hopefully Rare Replay is cool by itself. I think people should be really excited about it. CU I think it's really great but I also think that hopefully it's something others can learn from yeah I mean cuz I I remember thinking back to like I mentioned Mario All-Stars, it's I love that collection like that if I had to choose one collection is my favorite game of all time like that's it's perfect you know um and then I remember when it was Mario's 20th anniversary right they released on the Wii and they just yeah that red box they just it the the box was great and all the stuff was great and then the game was just a ROM dump of All-Stars and it's like that is",

The beauty is that they own all those games so it's there's no there's no hoops to jump through and different publishers to deal with like they did with Rare Replay. I'm what I'm kind of curious about is the behind-the-scenes thing with Rare Replay, did they try to get some of these games and I'm not necessarily even talking about Donkey Kong Country, I don't think that would make sense but something like GoldenEye, like, did they for sure they tried, yeah, you have to imagine those conversations happen but it",
