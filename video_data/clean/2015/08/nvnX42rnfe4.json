All right, with your first topic, I'll kick it off. First topic comes from the community, remember if you have topics for me, we've kind of fallen off this a little bit, but I'm going to go back to it if you have topics for the show tweet Nick, that's not what we're doing, what we're not, we're not doing that, we're doing something where you go to KindaFunny.com forums. Oh right, I apologize, and that there should be a thread there where it's Game Over Greg Show topic suggestions, there you go, and if there's not, Lindsay, I love you, I love you to death, can you make that topic?

What's the ****? An animorph, you know, it's the book covers where it's like you see the transformation of a person into an animal. Oh, okay, okay. Didn't they do that in uh the popular series called Twilight? Yeah, that is actually... oh my God, I hate you. Twilight's a fan fiction of Animorphs. One of the main characters in the Animorph TV show on Nickelodeon is Iceman from the X-Men movies, really Sean Ashmore. That's cool. Yeah, I was always into it.

I started we had a little tab, you know, keep a table on the on the on the on the fridge, uh. So that's my Goosebumps story. The thing that gives me goosebumps is small G Goosebumps. Two things came to mind for me: one is a rock concert, but specifically the opening of a rock concert. Oh yeah, concerts - rock concerts all sorts of concerts. It's there's a science to there's science to getting people hyped up and it involves lights and it involves sound obviously but it involves dropping the house lights.",

For 31 there's really only like 10 um that they'll play in the beginning, so it's always fun to figure out which one they're going to play. Um the other thing that came to mind that gives me goosebumps when I go to Jets games and I've I've talked about this before, I want to see if I can find it - the Jets' chant is the greatest, I think really one of the great chants in sports um and uh does sound like Jets yeah Jets Jets here I'll show you I think I yeah you missed me didn't you Kevin so I have it I have it on my phone from one of the games I went to and I I'll see if this comes through all right that always gives me goosebumps as well",

I mean even then so when I went to see Ant-Man we did see the Star Wars trailer, we also saw Batman v Superman and it's just like these trailers - trailers are another thing designed to make you feel those moments of like oh my God a good trailer, yeah a good trailer does that.

But you have to like, in my opinion, I love A New Hope, but I like Empire obviously, Empire is like one of my favorite movies of all time, and I think Jedi is even better than A New Hope too. And that's a little controversial because usually people go Empire, New Hope, and then Jedi. But what I'm saying is this is setting up the trilogy, so I don't have like expectations of it being Empire. Like when I went into Attack of the Clones, my expectation was that I was like, \"All right, Episode One was pretty bad.\" This is the equivalent of Empire, so this has to be really good. And it was... awful. So um, so it was just an abomination. Was where the queen was elected, right? Where she was like, \"I'm queen, I'm elected by a bunch of people.\" I was like, \"Why do they call you Queen then? Why not?\"",

It's like Star Trek is, I would say maybe a little less popular than Star Wars depending on who you're talking to. I mean no, if you talk to people who are heavily into Star Trek, give me a break though. I mean, Star Trek is like not even on the same level in terms of popularity and in terms of quality too.

No but I mean for Christ's sake bring in JJ Abrams again and let him direct episode one and let's see where that goes. That was that was the only confusing move as we wrap this topic up is is they went in and they very deliberately after a lot of thought said like these things happened and these things didn't right, and they they pointed to a lot of the books with a few exceptions, and the games were like none of this happened.
