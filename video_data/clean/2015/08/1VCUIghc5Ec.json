So from a boy, you note probably a little out of left field here but do you guys think we'll ever get another PlayStation All-Stars? Who would you want in it? Who would you remove and uh tweaks to gameplay? No Ellie Toro, who would never get removed my personal thing you remove Toro yeah get rid of him and his **** all he does is steal people's powers. Do something have your own identity. I love Toro he was my dude that's what Kirby does I know and he sucks too Kirby he does suck don't talk **** about Kirby I don't like it yeah my God uh I'll talk I'll you talk **** about a lot of things but I'm not going to yeah you do like Kirby holy **** I need a gift of that that was good that was I'll see that in my",

Musha did yeah that was an Musha game there was Smash Bros inspired okay Smash Bros meets Power Stone. The problem Tim is the the cast and there's nothing they really could have done to that cast to make it any better, Crash Bandicoot being in it and Cloud were probably the only two noticeable noticeable misses and what would have that would and snake yeah well that's not going to happen because snake was you know like already tainted by that and and they got and and they did get there is a you know Raiden in the game isn't he yeah yeah so they did have they did have metal gear you know some metal gear presence in there but I'm not sure sure it mattered I think there's a lot of like there's a",

Some other games, like more recent ones, who cares? Exactly, nobody gives a ****. But what I'm saying is, what happens in Lightning Returns? Nobody knows, literally no one knows. Colin probably played a thousand hours and has no idea what happened. But you know, Arkham Knight - when can we talk about Arkham Knight? Right, exactly. No, we're not going to actually do it. Kevin, calm down. Yeah, I know it's a great question. I would say, I mean, turn next year sometime, mhm. When we come around. So does a sequel need to come out or is it just like even that? Like, I mean people were getting mad at them for showing the trailer for Arkham Knight where in the beginning Joker's dead. Like they showed that at E3 right and everybody's like, \"It's like what guys, the end of Arkham City was a long time ago.\" You know what I mean? Like, what do you want them to do?",

They're interconnected, I feel like it's a moving scale because in my mind, first came to me, I was like, \"All right, how ubiquitous is the game and how big is it right?\" And I was like, \"Okay, so Final Fantasy VII was what came to mind too. Like this is a famous moment with Aerith dying and everyone knows that Tifa didn't die. Uh, Cloud, Cloud didn't really even say anything.\" Um, so I feel like there's something about that where it's... I was like, \"All right, so ubiquity that's one thing. Like it's like an Empire when when Vader proclaims to Luke that he's a...\" I'm like, okay, I asked specifically about that question on the Game Over Greg show, I think oh while ago. I'm like, at that time how long was that spoiler expected to be kept secret? It reminds me of like The Sixth Sense right um",
