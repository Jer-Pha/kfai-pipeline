So, a long time ago, we had a show where each of us gave our five favorite games of all time. Um, so for you, I asked you to come with your five. We don't need to do that. We can just do when I ask you the questions, what are your favorite games of all time? What comes to mind? Starting to do in my head is going through generations of consoles because then I can start to hone in on what were my favorites at the time. So with the NES, Super Mario Brothers, I actually didn't get Super Mario 3 until much later. You know, my family didn't have a ton of money. So trust me, the things I had to go through for that one game, but you know, I'll say Super Mario Brothers, but the one that I still love is Ghosts 'n Goblins because Oh, that's a rough one, man. That's a great game, but it's as hard as **** nails. I was young enough. I didn't know that. I just",

I just thought this is gaming. I used to go to this um this it's kind of an arcade. It was it was a bowling alley near my house. I probably should not have been going there at the age I was all by myself, but I found this way to save money where I would ask my friend's parents to give me a ride to a BART station so I didn't have to take the bus so I could pocket the bus money. At the end of the week, I had enough quarters and I would go to that arcade and I try to play Ghosts 'n' Goblins and I couldn't get past the first level and finally it comes out for the home version on the NES and like I worked at it and worked at it and worked at it and worked at it and I finally like beat Satan or whatever it is at the end and it's like ah that's not the real one. Got to go back and play it again. And",

So awful. But I I love that game so much because that was the first time I think it's one of the first games that had a real sense of art direction and that I wanted to play it not for a score, not for bragging rights. I want to see what the next level look like. What weirdass enemies that don't make any sense are, you know, are they there? And I that's I think a really important my philosophy of how I like to play games.

And that was like I was the kid I actually got an NES like right around the time it launched. I think it was my parents were worried I was getting really lonely and I could get friends this way. My buddy Andre, he got a Sega Master System. I got more friends. He didn't know. You know what? I like the Sega Master System, Fantasy Zone, because it doesn't make any sense. It's like once upon a time, you got to make games like Fantasy Zone. It's like, what is it? I don't know.

So, I mean, I liked those two from like the early era I really like. I didn't play a ton on SNES. That's when I was in college. Um, and games were not going to happen. Sure. What I was going to be, it's one or the other. And but then when I started, you know, I was I was on GameSpot TV. I mean, one of the games that always will stand out to me is Banjo-Kazooie because, you know, because I ended around the time of the SNES, I was aware of like Street Fighter and stuff like that, but I missed as things started to move into 3D. And so I I get this job and they're like, \"Cool. You know something about games. You need to know more. You got to go play some.\" So the first big game that came out around that time was Banjo.

I'm like, \"This is really cool.\" And my roommates hated me because all they heard like on a Saturday morning while everyone was hungover is, \"Woo! Turn that **** off.\" You guess that year also was Half-Life. I think that was the first time I had seen like an adult game. I guess earlier that year cuz the thing about 1998 was Half-Life was so big. That was also the year of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid. Wait, no. Was that Metal Gear? Yeah, it was Metal Gear Solid. Yeah. Was that Metal Gear Solid? I think they were all in the same month. It might have been because... somebody's greatest monster over my head.

Oh, and Unreal came out that year as well because it was really like the first engines allowed you to go from indoors to outdoors seamlessly. I mean, it was that was such a nutty year. But like Half-Life, that was the first time I'm like, \"Oh, hold on. There's something really interesting happening here.\" Yeah. In the industry. So, was that four? Yeah. What else? What else do I like? I I really do like most games. You said Galaxy earlier. You're talking about Super Mario Galaxy. That's right. Super Mario Galaxy. I I love platformers.

So, I went back to review it and it was a Friday and I was going to go see some friends. I put it in. I thought it was going to be fine, but it was a Wii game, so I didn't know how it was going to work and like I just blew through the first world and I'm like, what the hell?

We're just going to make it harder. Like everything felt purposeful in its design, and it should be there in the game except for the the purple stars. Oh, right. Red ring things happen. I I will say that to Galaxy's credit because I always had the Wii reservations too. Although not at the time. I was still kind of in the Wii in 2007. Uh the waggle felt totally normal.

How do you feel about how do you feel about the original BioShock compared to I love the original BioShock. In an odd way, I think the original BioShock is still less individualistic from a creative standpoint. I think it's a stronger game in terms of just sort of like how some of the challenges present themselves, but just kind of the flash of color, the aesthetics, and all that stuff that's happening in Infinite, you know, Columbia is certainly a different place.

Um, where I don't I think they got some feedback from EA. I think they got some feedback from more casual gamers that were like, \"This is too much of a role playing game.\" And the first one was Microsoft's Mass Effect, which later came to PlayStation. My funny feeling is maybe they weren't being monitored as heavily back then. That's true. That's a good point. It was a Microsoft game.

I turned off my Xbox and you know I see it was I think it was plugged into the internet. I'm like, maybe it's reporting me and they know I'm a bad person. I really had that deep a reaction to it.

I think people were pretty hard on it. I always way too hard cuz I always describe it as like what what were you exactly expecting? I always describe the story as an upside down pyramid. At some point, you have to get back to the focus peak of it and it has to it has to end, you know? So, like I don't know what the **** you wanted them to do. You wanted to end in 15 different ways.

But, um, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had been the previous year. So, I think what's interesting is up until this point, I might be wrong, there's probably a couple exceptions, you didn't see a lot of open world coming out of EA. And with Skyrim, we start to see that huge push in that direction that that is an economically viable and recommended way to go. So I think that also I think opens things up that they're going to need to have a deeper people are more comfortable now with those mechanics.

I'd like to see them the brilliance about going to Andromeda Galaxy since everything's, you know, spoilers for Mass Effect, it's over in the Milky Way, is uh that this doesn't tie them to anything that's real anymore. And so what I'm most excited about is that we don't know anything about the Andromeda galaxy other than that it's closest to us and that it exists. So like what like what will you find there?

So like what like what will you find there? Can we go to the floaty um you know jellyfish looking people planet? I really want the the was it the Hutt? Yeah, that's right. Um so I' I'd love my what I'm excited about with Andromeda is for them to open up a new trilogy. And what I'm really excited about for them is that they are going to wrap it back into the original trilogy. I **** know it. and and you are going to find yourself back in the Milky Way and and and trying to my whole theory about is that it's going to be like some sort of time thing with the with the Reapers and like trying to undo what they did or whatever by like beating them to the punch or like using I I think that they're going to tie it back in and I think that that's going to be really exciting. That's cool. But, you know, I'm just making that up. But that's what I",

I think that's the setup is that they go to, you know, they're in Andromeda and they hear something about what happened in this other place and it's totally different characters and they go and they go back to the Milky Way and they find that it's dead and it's like what happened and all. I think it's going to be good. Yeah. Before moving on topics, I really want to know what your thoughts are on Mario 64 because you said you came back to Banjo Kazooie and you love Super Mario Galaxy. No question. I I I think Banjo is the superior game. Oh my god. There's no question. And I think it's it's you know it's mainly because there's no overworld. There's no proper overworld in Super Mario 64. And that to me was",

There's no proper overworld in Super Mario 64. And that to me was so clever in Banjo-Kazooie. The way that you would travel around and you would like you have to figure out where you where the puzzle piece was to unlock the door that was somewhere else inside of that. It it made the entire game feel so cohesive so that when I went back and I tried to play Super Mario 64 and I I mean the level design is great, but it was okay, jump in that picture. Okay, now I can go into those pictures, but I do I mean it's kind of what we were talking about earlier. It didn't have that nice kind of structure and that cohesion. It just felt like more or less a series of exercises. In contrast, great exercises, but there was that extra special thing that came out of it. No, man. That's the key difference though. That's why I love Super Mario 64 is because it is just like level to level and",

But yeah, the open world, even the open like the the the world thing of Banjo-Kazooie, I'm like, no, I can't do. I was going to say uh you know the superior game 64 which is Super Mario Sunshine. Thank you so much. Uh has a has a crazy has a great little hub world called Delphino Plaza. The worst game sucks. The worst hub world of of any of the Mario games in Galaxy's hub world was not good. That was probably one of my least favorite things. But it's funny because that that didn't bother me really. It's like that's Super Mario 64. I think just you know what I think another was camera controls. Yeah. I can't remember what the Banjo-Kazooie camera they were similar to. It was similar to Super Mario 64.
