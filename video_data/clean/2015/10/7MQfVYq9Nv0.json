Does it shoot? Oh, it does shoot. Oh man, that's not a good idea. I know right, let's shoot a thing that's like the tiniest little thing that's a cyborg. Everybody from the hit game Lego Dimensions lost this forever. Don't worry, they G - they send you three extras. So do they? I wish they did that when we were kids, right? Well, they learned. They lost all my missiles for all my planes and... my GI Joe. That ain't a good idea at all. So okay, Uncharted. Right, this is a very, very big deal to me that this Uncharted Nathan Drake collection came out because in 2007 the game came out - Uncharted 1 on PlayStation 3, and I did not own a PS3 at the time because I was a poor child. You don't have to make excuses; I didn't own a... I was on the PlayStation team, didn't own a PlayStation year, yeah that was a thing but then Metal Gear Solid 4",

So I think as far as I understand Bluepoint has and I was reading about this because I just didn't, I actually didn't play Uncharted 2 or Uncharted 3 in the collection, Greg played all of them on our let's play, so I don't know the gist of it is that they apparently unified the combat a little bit between the games which is cool because there was differences people had a huge problem with the combat especially and I think that um pre-patch I think once they patched it there was something off about that game with a lot of people what not, I didn't really I mean I remember I remember that vaguely, it's a long time ago, that's like 150 games ago, um but uh so to answer your questions uh we spent a little bit of",

That's always been their style with their first games too, Crash Bandicoot for instance. You know, it's like that's they don't nail difficulty levels right the first time, they just don't. And uh, that's a very good point. I mean, it definitely feels like and it's not to say Uncharted one was difficult, it's just compared to two, two got the balance so much better. It was just fun, like I never felt anytime I died a couple times, it was my fault, I knew what I was doing, I knew what I had to do better the next time. That's good, you know?

And I think that one was a little bit repetitive, like it was you know very much you climb a bit then cut scene, cut scene, and then you shoot a bunch of enemies and people just keep kind of coming. And then there weren't too many set pieces in one, like there were a few key things, but especially not compared to two. Yeah, I guess \"setpiece\" is kind of the wrong place, maybe we used a wrong word, maybe Arena, Arena makes sense, yeah. There'd be like an arena thing and then a puzzle, and the puzzle just slows everything to like a crawl where all of a sudden it wasn't this forward moving thing, it's like \"all right, I need to stop and think about this stuff.\" I definitely think the puzzles are the weakest parts so far, and that also goes into two.
