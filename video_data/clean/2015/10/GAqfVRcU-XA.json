Today we're going to play Super Meat Boy on uh PlayStation 4, also available on PlayStation Vita, recently it was on Xbox 360 and PC long ago, years ago. But since this has come out since we started Kinda Funny, we thought we would play it here on the PS4. Yeah, last night I went in with the PS+ got it on my Vita; it's so I played on I've been playing it on Vita too. I think it's a little small Meat Boy is a little small for I play it. I downloaded it; I didn't get into it yet cuz I knew we were doing this Let's Play day. I wanted my Meat Boy virginity, to have my Meat Boy virginity so Super Meat Boy by Team Meat, well known and renowned for its difficulty, it's high level of difficulty, very high level of difficulty. Well, the F The Forest which is the first uh uh set of 20 stages there are multiple many sets of stages, is the easiest one. So I figure I've played the game; I'll slide through.",

Yeah, no, it's a pain in the ass. You have to... it takes quite the dance. What would I have to do then? You have to like jump onto the lowest one and then like a road just one of them there, jump up again, get it, and then you don't want to erode it on the left too much or you're not going be able to get up. So it's a little bit of a dance. This is fun, I like it a lot. It is cool. It's worth noting... uh... depending on when you're watching this, it may or may not be true, but in October in North America anyway, I think it's true in Europe, I'm not sure, you'll have to look for your locality, but this is free on PlayStation Plus, yeah, so that's why I said I downloaded it last night.

What was it? Is over to see I get in this zone, this like platformer zone, I'm just like all right, run. The bandages aren't very obvious, I don't think. I mean are they like do most people try to get them? Uh no, I would assume not. I mean unless you're into collectibles or trophies, whatever the trophy list by the way in this game is impossible so I'll be interested to see who manages to platinum this game cuz it's going to be really hard. You have to beat sets of 20 stages without dying all the 20, all them. What's interesting is that holding the Run button in the air changes your physics makes you speed up so you always have yeah so you always have speed even yeah that's interesting oh God got see right there mhm I'm scared I think you gotta jump on the same wall the same wall the that you're on instead of jumping over oh yeah",

Yeah, all right now things will get a little more complicated for you. I wanted to bandage up, get 114, are we getting places here? It's just slowly teaching you, yeah, which I like. It gets really absurd in future worlds. Oh God, nice! Oh that was close; the bandage is there might not be one on the stage no. Oh God, nice! Recruiting 117 Morning Star. How many uh levels are in each world? Twenty plus a boss fight, there's a boss fight. It's more of a boss course but yeah okay I'm sorry about that. My assumption is this stage is called Morning Star because of the mace thing, Mm-hm, swinging thing. Are those things called Morning Stars?

Termination 119 it always interests me when I play a platformer that feels right and different at the same time yeah this game's definitely got more float than I would like in my Platformers typically but it's fine you just got to get used to it not every game's going to feel the same nor should it. Oh God round me that's what I love about the character which is just fun funny like it's just silly it's just e like I like when you die you see the meat that you had last time very cool yeah it's just on the blade it's a thoughtful game for sure the animation does when he runs Reminds me of Pichu and Melee nice all right now you got to this jump",
