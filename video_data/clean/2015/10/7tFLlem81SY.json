So, 18 years later, I was at his wedding party, and so I had to go to Connecticut. He married this really nice girl, Cassandra, and uh, so I had to go to Connecticut and meet her family \u2013 her stepfamily is very wealthy. They have this beautiful estate in the middle of nowhere, just woods, and um, it was awesome. And uh, no service, but I was with a bunch of my old friends, and one of them is a professor now in college, and he brought up this: We were... we were I was basically just drinking the entire time I was there, like one would do when you have no service. And we're staying in this house from 17:30, and we would just sit around this fire pit outside of it and chairs, and just chat about things until all hours in the morning.

He brought up this thing that I thought was interesting, so indulge me if you will for a minute. I want to explain you what it is, and then I'll ask you what you think of it. It's called the \"young earth hypothesis\" and it has another name - I'll get to that in a minute. According to Wikipedia, this will be the best way to boil it down: the argument that God created the world recently, in the last 10,000 years, in keeping with flood geology, which you would know about if you went to Catholic school. But complete, but complete with signs of great age. So, you guys understand that - in other words, the argument that God created it recently, but complete with signs of great age. Some people saw some revival in the 20th century by some creationists who extended this idea.",

So this is like a creationist kind of idea held by some people that believe in the Young Earth, that it's so young but that they acknowledge that there are signs that make it seem like it's old but it's not so. If you were to cut down a tree in the Garden of Eden, there would be no rings in it or Adam and Eve weren't born from anyone; Eve was from Adam's rib and Adam was created by God, so they have no navies since there was no one and so that kind of stuff.

Some people think those things were buried and the idea of like the earth isn't that interesting that you could take this idea of like the earth was created 10,000 years ago and God's tricking everyone it's like well you don't know that the earth wasn't created 5 minutes ago actually based on the same exact principle. And I'm curious what you guys think about hold on, that doesn't make sense although because it's a hypothesis right?

If I'm not mistaken, you cannot think that something cannot be proven by logic or anything, therefore we're always right. But inversely, talking about is the inverse argument is or you're always wrong. Yeah, you sound like we're like God's boyfriend or girlfriend so just like no matter what we define as God's boyfriend because no matter what God says he's always right and we're always wrong, so we're the guy in this situation or at least we're God's husband says.",

I mean people do believe in Earth being created last Thursday, and I'm not judging them, a lot of Christians for instance, I speak for myself, but maybe I know best, I don't believe The Earth is 5 billion years old and like believe that the universe is 13.2 or 13.5 billion years old and do believe that you know there were dinosaurs and that humans are only 100,000 years old or so and stuff like that.
