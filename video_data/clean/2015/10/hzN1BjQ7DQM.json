The first topic of the day is horror games: what makes a good horror game? Now this is spurred by a little something special - some project you're working on, yeah? Tell us a little bit about this. So um I have the pleasure of getting to work with it's it's a small team right now, uh, it's a mixture of Gun Media and another group called ILBeast (corrected from \"IL phonic\") and they were once upon a time already announced working on a game called Friday the 13th: The Game (corrected from \"slasher volume one summer camp\"), an homage to 1980s slasher flicks. You can probably imagine it - it's asymmetric multiplayer, one person plays the killer, seven people play counselors. The point is for the killer to kill all the counselors and for the counselors to escape or make it",

Cunningham who directed the first Friday the 13th and is the man who owns the rights to the franchise he heard about this and he's like well I've been waiting for a game a good game to give the Friday the 13th license to and he gave it to them, and yeah so now the game they were always implying the franchise they were implying with the game now gets to be that game that's why they've gone back to Kickstarter because while they were funded sufficiently to make Summer Camp the requirements you know now with the accuracy recreating Crystal Lake making",

So what if you have three people who are all trying to work on getting it? So there's a wonderful sense of both teamwork and treachery and that wonderful sort of tension. You know it really kind of captures I think the spirit of what those movies always wanted to do which is you feel helpless, you know against this highly overpowered enemy and whether or not you sort of have the wherewithal how clever you are to make it through the evening mhm so is it like Perma death if you if Jason gets you and kills you you're out of that and then you'll you'll you'll get to watch what happens to everyone else, you know you can scream all",

So in essence, there's one map, and initially when they were working on it, they had a very, very big map, and it was just too big. You know the length of time for Jason to finally encounter you it was taking too long or hiding in one corner forever. So that was so now it's it's in essence one map but it will be somewhat randomized. So you know you're you're going to have elements like a barn, you know this the stuff you've seen in the movies. So you won't be playing the exact same map every time, but you are playing at Crystal Lake every time. And are you playing as any of the kids from the movies or is are these going to be like the um because of licensing issues they cannot replicate those because those are actors Kevin Bacon was in the first one, but um but you are playing I think you should expect to play familiar characters",

I've watched all of them back-to-back - that's a fascinating tour of 80s style and Valhalla system. You have a bag over your head for two, obviously someone very different in one... you know, then the hockey mask emerges in three, but then you come back from the dead in six, and then I've been underwater getting really rotten from seven through nine - and so you know, they're showing variants of Jason.

Do you guys have to figure this out in the future like a price point - is this a retail game or a downloadable game? Like what can people expect in terms of delivery? I mean right now, the determination is PC, Xbox One, PS4. I think it's fair to assume that retail would be the goal with this. Um, I don't want to fully commit on that right now because you just caught me off guard. Sorry, I'm just trying to imagine my head - is it a $20 game? Is it a $40 game? Is it a $60 game?

We're in the middle of the Kickstarter right now, and that might be putting that cart well in front of that horse. And I think the success of the Kickstarter will determine a lot of those matters. Like many Kickstarters, I mean right now the Kickstarter last we looked was just crossed 150,000 as a record right now. Yeah, so I mean yeah. Which which is very very exciting. Um, obviously we're aiming for 700,000, which is a lot of money. Um, but that really has been well thought out about what is necessary to get all of those art assets in.

No, and this is you - it's this is stuff that they're working on right now. I mean, because unlike even other asymmetric games where there still is some sort of sense of balance, albeit very different, Jason is supposed to be overpowered. Yes, you can kill him, but it is going to be extraordinarily hard and the amount of risk you're probably going to take on because you're probably going to have to do it with a lot of other people - like that is your burden in hand. I mean, you're you're going for the bush um so you you you want to have overpowered to have that but the counselors will have skill sets. You know we are going to have the girl next door. We're very aware of kind of what the stereotypes are. We don't they don't want to talk too much about those specifically because that is what is being worked on, but there are certain edges that you will have that will help.",

I'm assuming that if for to kill Jason is it basically a mousetrap kind of puzzle where it's like we all are doing this so you set up this part and you do this and then we all run that is still in decision and I've even chatted a little bit about I mean that that is one of the biggest decisions to make because A it has to be believable B it has to really respect that you know this is not it doesn't really get accomplished in the movie so it has to be something that you know it just it",
