The actual cockpit looks a little different, but they've got that sort of red stripe of the First Order. And so we're definitely... And so this is what I love about Star Wars. They've done such a great job, especially with this one, of like saying let's take the tack of before and kind of bring it up a little bit, throw a little modernized flare on it, and go. This is the crazy thing: I want to point out that even the wardrobes have changed a little bit. Before we used to see Luke with boots on, and he had very much sort of a futuristic look now we're",

Now we're getting a slightly more modern costume, which is a little reminiscent of another space series that we know JJ Abrams directed as well. Definitely what I think is interesting about this though is seeing his touches here right now in the all black garb - I think that's just his stormtrooper outfit underneath what they were under, and I think that jacket is something he just found or stole. Clearly he's crashed or we have the remember from the first trailer where he kind of wakes up and he's like in the middle... so I think that he's in that TIE fighter as it crashes down - oh that's a possibility, that's interesting.

So we know the shape of this helmet is very very Darth Vader. We see him, we hear that voice over of him uh uh basically praying to The Cult of Vader saying I'm going to finish what you started but I don't know, I mean it's crazy cuz we we're seeing those even him we're going to see a later shot with him and his homies where he's got that little crew of people together that all have the oddly like the dark black armor. See you'll see so so what's happening here Nick as you can see in the poster of this movie there's a new Death Star, like um oh you think he's on the going on I think that this is uh like the control deck of that and this Blaster right there, that's the modern green",

There's a book that came out called Aftermath; it's the first official Canon book in this new Canon okay, and in it there's a reference to Boba Fett's armor - and it's not directly called Boba Fett's armor but uh a bunch of Jawas have some armor, some dude looks at him, he's like \"man, that metal or and armor like they sure made that resilient\" and they describe it as if it's been through hell and it's just had a battle with acid - interesting, aka Stahc acid yeah okay.

So this is that plan that it looks... this looks similar to that, but it might be a different plan actually. Those look like different trees, yeah there's trees and stuff. I'm I'm not really sure. This is obviously big-ass battle they're having. This is the this shot quick shot of them.
