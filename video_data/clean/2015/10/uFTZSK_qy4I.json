E3 was choked out of your mind. You took your pants off. You ran around. I was like, Tim, keep your pants off. Just keep them off cuz it was it was sweaty down there. Uh, and now you've got your hands on it. So, let's let's jump in. We're going We're going in the story mode here. I'm going to play Warrior, which is essentially the normal. But I I've been told that it that even the normal mode is difficult. It's a platinum game. Sure. So So, we're going in from there. And also I'm not good at video games. No, you're not that great at them. This is going to be But you are good at being a Transformers fan and that's all that matters. I definitely am.

Yeah, it was bad. Then why do you like it? Why do you like that specific Well, I like the cast of characters and I like what they've done. Like for example, the IDW comics that are going on currently and like have been going on since 2005 are undeniably the greatest incarnation of Transformers of all time. Okay. So, I can I can get behind that. What I'm interested to see in this is is what it's really kind of going after. I mean, obviously it's very Generation One cartoon focused cuz it looks like it.

They got everyone that's alive. Like the certain voice enters that died like Will Arnett happens when you I'm skipping that. All right. So, it's a platinum game which means, you know, it's it's very very similar to a lot of their other things like Bayonetta and stuff where it's kind of like hack and slash going around. I was playing it a little bit this morning but not really enough to like get into it. Right. So you're still sort of learning. Yeah. So when everyone in the comments says you can't play this game for Shit, they'll be right. I mean they'll be correct about that. But so I already like this.

The ground the ground soldiers. Ground soldiers. It's fine. They don't know who you are. Yeah. So it just kind of teaches you the basic things of just combos and stuff. Um that's not a hard combo. just square square. So you can just do it and then there's a vehicle attack that you can do where you hit R1 and you kind of like do a super powerful attack that way and you can transform on the fly in combat. Something interesting to me about this is that the control scheme is not off the bat like very intuitive. I mean, it's intuitive in the sense that it's a video game and it's like hit square to light attack and triangle to heavy attack, but there's a lot of things tied to R1 cuz R1 tapping it causes at the right time after combos the vehicle attack, but it's also the counter.

Let's just make R1 do everything pretty much. Okay. Hey, I respect that. Coming straight off Metal Gear where every single thing does everything. Conehead seekers here. Come on, scrap them. I always thought and and you know this is my layman's knowledge of Transformers. Uh I always felt that the Autobots - you can shoot as well - got the short end of the stick when it came to the vehicles they could transform pretty much. And follow me on this. It would be way more beneficial in a war environment to be able to fly than it would be to be a slow-moving Mack truck. Yeah. I mean, well, it's definitely not slow moving, but even in the the",

They can still fly. Yeah. Like even in Robots, they just put their hands up. That was dope. And it's got a D. Well, you were talking through. Yeah, but even then though, like I didn't feel like it did that bad. Um, does this tie into any story canon? So, that's what I'm like - what I'm interested in is I didn't get far enough to really see. I don't think it does. I think it's just kind of a loose Generation One, like these characters in different continuity because this definitely is not in the comic canon. And uh, it's interesting even the logo of this.

Um, this is very different from for a Transformers game because usually we're used to like either horrible horrible games or the like War for Cybertron series that came out a couple years ago. There was a bit more like the Arkham Batman games. Yeah. Where was darker in tone and like a little more It wasn't quite like the movies, but uh it was like a good version of the movies. Sure, I guess you could say. Oo, what'd you get? Repair packs. That's fun. There's five different Autobots you can play as. Obviously, I'm my boy Optimus right now. I can't remember that.

Grimlock life tree. Giant wind thing blowing me back. So I have to transform into truck mode naturally. Rock it out. I like how you have flames coming out of your uh exhaust pipes. Hold up.

I just keep getting distracted by how cool this game looks. If I could give this game to me when I was like eight. Oh, you would have just never gone outside. I wouldn't believe this would be a video. You would have split your time between this and pornography and you would have been done. You would have starved to death. See, there's my boy Grimlock. What up, Grimlock? What's he going to say again? No. Yeah, he can't get through original dude. So, you got to kill me. Yeah, he's still like early tutorial. See, look. Look how badass that is.

So, this is one of those games where, you know, eventually you get really good at the combat and you want to go back and replay it and like have everything look beautiful and cool. I've never been that guy. No, I just kind of hack and slash and button mash my way through things, die a million times, but just keep doing it. But it's fun. The thing that's interesting about this is that the gameplay is like it's a little slow like walking around and stuff, but then the combat is like ridiculously fast, especially when you get the uh vehicle moves in involved like vehicle like that.

Are you using square? Yeah. No, I'm doing are you also using R1? Yeah. You got it. You nailed it. You're pro at this game already. You're doing a great job. Just FYI, you're winning.

The first season's actually surprisingly small cast and it is people that you've seen in like the the intros and Season two is when they just started adding hell. Then season 3 comes which was right after the movie. The movie was the intro to season 3 and they just killed everybody off and made a whole bunch of new dudes. They had to. Yeah. Um but what was what I grew up with was Generation Two. Okay. So what Generation Two was, you know, it's the '90s. It was a different time. I remember the '90s. Everything got a little bit longer and a little more complicated. Yeah. In the '90s, including me. Oh god. Where you going with that? Were you supposed to go",

Were you supposed to go up? I'm not sure. They ran to nowhere. So, it's hard to do and talk. But Transformers Generation 2 was It was just Generation One, so it was just the show you grew up with. Sure. But they added um a new intro and a new like in between breaks there was like a a CG Optimus Prime that uh like talked to you and kind of explained what was going on. Okay. So I always thought that was just like a different thing that I grew up with. I didn't realize it was just the 80s show with a different coat of paint. Interesting. And then it got really real with Beast Wars in the late 90s. I'm going to die. And that's the one you love, right? Well, these original Transformers are definitely like my favorite and I love them.

Yeah, that seems cuz an animal is not as strong as the Mack truck. That's true. But you're talking about the great rhino. Well, the Rhinox. The Rhinox. There was a Rhinox. Rhinox. Yeah. One of the main good guys. He's like a tank. Rhinox. We need to bust through this wall. Like, **** man. I'm better than that, but sure, I'll do it. What was cool about Beast Wars is absolutely no human characters. Oh, they didn't have the stupid kids that were like, \"Hey, my dad said we could come hang out.\" Yeah. Like, you make me uncomfortable by being here. This is an adult situation. You're a small child. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like it was a little weird that it was just Optimus and my three kids.

Like little tiny babies that come out of like little dirt bikes. This is the dirt bike. Why do I have a flamethrower? It seems like not useful for me right now. It's not really a range weapon as they say. Uh it's more close range. I like what I'm doing though. I don't know what the hell you're doing. I don't like it. But it's very colorful.

Well, you're going to have to do it a little better than you've been doing it, bro. I like how physics in this world just really doesn't matter. But that thing killed that. How can I go faster?

It takes a bit and then it happens. Convenient. Yeah. A little weird. I don't really want you thinking too much on this one, do I? No, but that's that's kind of not intuitive because you expect, you know, when you're driving the car, you would expect to just be able to hit the gas and go. Okay, there we go. You got it.
