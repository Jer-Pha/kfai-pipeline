I know, I, I, I want, I want they did Kurosawa, they're going to do another, they're going to do a movie, they're doing they're doing a movie too. But like the idea behind that series and I'm not talking about the 1970s Battlestar Galactica which is terrible, I'm not talking about that, I'm just talking about the idea behind the new Battlestar Galactica which takes like a very old science fiction trope which is like robots turning on the people that made them, uh it's like The Terminator, but doing it in a very clever way. Like I tried to get Greg to watch and he didn't click for him, didn't like it either. How long is this? How long is this? It's for Four Seasons, the it's long, it's cuz it's about like cuz the the important context about that scene which I love is that the the humans created robots that turned on them, they felt enslaved and they and they fought",

I mean that's like the whole missing thing is the Syons have been slowly plotting yeah yeah that's why it's like come back and destroy everything so when they come back and they destroy the space station at the same time they're attacking the colonies like all the planets that the humans are on and destroy all of them with nuclear bombs and the only people that are alive are the people that are in space, so like there's 50,000 people uh in space in transit",

They basically shut down the ships and then just come after so as their fighters are coming toward them, they just start drifting out into space and they just have to watch as the ships come and just destroy them, which is terrifying, and of course then you've got the Battlestar Galactica, which is like then the crew has to mobilize and try to save as many people as they can but that's actually not the brilliance of the show.",

They didn't have the big movies, but it would be interesting to look at and see if comics are still struggling as an actual medium. Yeah, I don't mean they're not doing well; it's now they're multimedia companies. What we're talking about is a lot like the games industry right, and the fact that when comics were being treated as kids' toys, they were just kids' toys.
