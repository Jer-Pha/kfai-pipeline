Yeah you know Saturn's are so prominent Jupiter has rings Uranus has rings and Neptune has rain. Jupiter is the biggest of all the planets right yes by far yes you can fit all the other planets in Jupiter yeah big shout out to Jupiter for that. Big shout out to Jupiter. Jupiter is a might be a failed star it might have been a binary system I also have the coolest name Jupiter yeah God of War sounds badass God of War is Ares no there's Roman and Roman god yeah um yeah Jupiter there's only one God of War was that Mario all right let's not get out of there Mars might have been the God of yeah because it's red yeah it's a red planet Jupiter was what ooh speed let's",

Neptune - I don't know. Neptune's a good planet, you see, like underrated though. Who the... dude, who cares about Neptune? I remember in high school, I couldn't remember; I named all of them, couldn't remember Neptune started asking all my friends, \"I'm like, name all the planets,\" and like five people named all of them but Neptune - they're like, \"Oh, ****, I don't know what that last one is.\" And there you go. You know, that's why my very mother just baked me... yeah, I never needed that. It was my my what is it? My very energetic mother just bake made me... just I don't know. Can we all name them?

It's just cool that the asteroid belt is five billion years old, and the universe is 13.7 billion years old. There's all this cool evidence about cosmic stuff that happened - that's what I'm really fascinated by. It's the same thing with the rogue planet that hit Earth back in the day, giving us the moon.

Well, we've never really seen it when you ever look at pictures of it, it's like two pixels, yeah, and like we don't really know anything about it, you know Charon or Caron, depending on how you say it is, is a is uh it's moon and we've never seen it either. We just know it's there because of like the way the planet wobbles and in fact they wobble around each other around a center, a point in the middle which means that one and the other are like not that much different in size, they actually like rotate around a center space, what's the center space is that another planet? No, it's just like a point in between them.",

No, it's just like a point in between them, like a central axis. But what's funny is that New Horizons is still going to Pluto, and it arrives next year really. And that's like what's so cool is that we're finally going to see this dwarf planet you know, like I'm really excited about it. What if we get there and you see cities? What proportion do they use to get something that far out in space? Is it solar? Yeah, it's solar, but like they use you know what they call gravity assist. So like they'll send, I think with New Horizons, they actually sent it into the inner solar system and then it like swings around, like it'll swing around Venus and get a gravity assistance shot.

I have such a crush on him, man. I really do. Like, he's so smart. Like I love listening to them talking. Did you want to watch Carl Sagan's Cosmos? Right, I try to it's a little dated but so good though, dude. Scientists say we'll never know what happens on the moon that's not true but uh but it's cool because it's not only about the planets in space it's about life and like how our life comes from the last episode it was really cool a lot of it was about dogs and like the diversity of dogs and how the diversity of dogs that we found are",

So, like, they would keep them away but then they would realize that the humans realized that the Cro-Magnon realized that they could encourage the wolves to protect them and bark and do all these things if they fed them. And then, like, created this sort of system where one is being protected and taking care of, and the others being taken care of.
