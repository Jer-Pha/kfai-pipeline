The one I'd love is Harry Potter 100% okay when they open the Harry Potter land I'm still bitter that I haven't gone there yet sure they're opening one in LA or something like that yeah, LA or yeah Hollywood okay I gotta go to it uh I when I read the Harry Potter books so badly like I was like this close to writing fanfiction for Harry Potter that's how much I love that world you essentially did did did the April Fools video I about it it's amazing here's the link nope Greg won't do that um jokes on him I just it might um I love that world so much I think it's and they're",

I think it's and they're making three more movies now, and I'm super excited that that's staying alive. And I know when you were caught up in the Zeitgeist of Harry Potter, it was hard to imagine a world where you weren't like looking forward to something Harry Potter. So I'm glad I can get back to that emotional state. Um, the other fantasy world that I would absolutely not want to live in... Who, who no, you need to talk more about that. There's problems with your Harry Potter Universe. What's wrong with being a Muggle or are you a Magician? I'd probably be a Muggle. I'd like to be a Wizard. A magician - are they magicians? No, they're Wizards. They're magicians; they use sleight of hand all the time with their talking chocolates. They don't go like this and they Pi... your there's a whole part where they do that, where they're... at no point do they go like",

And then they used the wrong rivets, and they screwed it up; it's still wrong. One of my favorite college humor videos ever was one where Stormtroopers were talking in a bar about the Death Star as if it was 9/11. Which sounds really bad, but it was so well-written that it sounded really portentous. It was really funny because they're talking about it like it's a serious event and how bad it was. Oh, it was good; it's good. Yeah, you should check it out. Colin, Colin... The place I wouldn't want to live in is the Road Runner universe. Specifically because it's not...

So you turn 10, you get to just go out and explore the world with your new little animal friend, and like pretty much that's it \u2013 fight other terrifying animal monsters, but it's not perfect. There are so many issues in Pok\u00e9mon, like slavery \u2013 there's the slave issue, anim\u00e9 issues. Let's take that out of it. No, they're friends. I keep you in a ball; you beat one of your monsters, you beat the other one mercilessly until it can't protect itself, and then you put it in a ball, and then it's yours until it faints. They don't die, and when they do, it's really sad, and then you sell them on the black market \u2013 put them on the Rock, get them sold on the black market.

Here's the problem I always have a Pok\u00e9mon when I really think about it what is the economy of this world because it can't all focus on the animals, like there's no market for anything, like they have big department stores where they sell only items relegated to your exploration of the world and you're capturing a Pok\u00e9mon and then they're a Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 the **** is everyone doing in this world and why are there only like 25 people day-care operators? There's a lot of fishermen I'm saying but they all, they all it's all about Pok\u00e9mon, yeah that's their world man I just think that's all that matters.
