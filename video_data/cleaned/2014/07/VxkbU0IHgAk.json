I think they got it right, I think they pretty much nailed it, you know, with the Constitution. Um, do you want me to go first because I have the most obvious ones? I have a few, but yeah, you can go. Obviously, get rid of \"In God We Trust.\" What were you thinking? They come in with this whole thing of like America is this country where religion won't matter, you know, separation of church and state, and then they immediately throw it up with all this \"In God\" stuff. They should have bored any mention of God from the Constitution or anything. But you're misunderstanding what they what they mean by this, as a dumb person, and keep in mind, dumb people like me are what's ruining America. With them, they just say, \"In God We Trust,\" clear.

It wasn't about atheism; that wasn't even a thing with them. You know, they were a lot of them were deists, but there was a lot of religious Founders or whatever - that wasn't uncommon at the time. What they were really talking about was removing the state from a specific Church, a specific basically Christian church right because in England the Church of England was tied up with the government of England ever since Henry VIII right?

God being whatever God you believe in, that's you know I mean y y y fine. But like now we're to the point where we have to argue about a Ten Commandments in the building or this that it's just yeah. I mean we didn't you know I don't think they anticipated this particular problem. You know like it's the same thing like you know when people talk about the Second Amendment, you know in the Bill of Rights which is like you know they didn't anticipate the assault rifle.

But the first one - in that one, I saw that on an airplane, and that was an unfortunate movie. Um so, so all right, yeah. So I agree, well, slavery there is like somewhat of a killer clause in the Constitution with regards to the importation of slaves, okay? Uh but they didn't outright ban slavery now yes this would have been the total ideal right but they didn't want you know and I'm not justifying it at all so of course wrong but there was just too much there was too many land-based plantation politics in um in doing that especially in the South and you have to understand many of the founders were from Virginia, right?

I mean you're going to say it and I'll be like I remember studying that once but no the Third Amendment is ridiculous, I and I I appreciate I appreciate why they why they did it because what happened especially in Boston During the Revolution but and New York City but it's that the American government can never quarter soldiers in your house oh right and that was because there was something called the Quartering Act in 1774 where um the British would send troops to Boston and they can just live with you and eat your food and do whatever they want and that happened in New York City when New York City was occupied during the whole Revolution so we have this like weird Amendment where it's",

If that war went a different way, that whole section might be part of the United States. The Maritime Provinces; we also wanted Cuba, and that happened later in the Spanish-American War in 1898, but um, you know, so there's like little things there like where you read some of this stuff and you're like I don't know, you know, maybe I know a lot of people have problems with the um uh the Electoral College; I don't, I think it makes perfect sense, um, but a lot of people don't, so maybe maybe you know.

They would submit these essays to newspapers with pen names, explaining why certain things in the Constitutional Convention (1787, 1786, 1788) led to those conclusions. John Jay wrote a few, but Hamilton and Madison wrote the lion's share of them. They would explain themselves, and you can really get an idea of where they were coming from with the decisions they were making by reading these papers because people thought they were just op-ed writers, but later when they realized that James Madison actually wrote those himself and he wrote the Constitution, then you can start to kind of understand where they were coming from.
