Number one, buffalo wings, chicken wings of course. Pizza bagels then we're into broccoli, then we're into sushi. That's the five. Greg, that's not well-known at all. That is a topic I talk about all the time on the podcast and in conversations with... I mean, I'm with this one, I don't think it's well-known. I could have guessed four of them if you said Nick guess the foods that I love - pizza, wings, Oreos, everybody. Follow me on Game... this isn't happening live for you, but set... I would say his foods were... does the light always flash? Wings, I could have sworn the light always is on not flashing. Oh, does it mean it's not recording? No, it means it's recording. I'm battery near end. What? Oh, we didn't flick on the battery over to DC. We got it. Everyone good, good call Greg, thank you. It would have started beeping anyway.

Yeah, like they're a game changer because yogurt's good but it's lacking something. What's that something? A little crunch, yeah, yeah, little honey crunch. Honey crunch. Uh, we all know Wing Wings is an amazing wing restaurant in Lower Haight, SF. Um, on Twitter, \"gravy fries extra gravy.\" Yes, you want to do that. Across the street is a place called Kate's Kitchen. I went there for breakfast the other day. You've been there; you love Kate's Kitchen. Kate's Kitchen has the buckwheat cheddar bacon pancake.

One of the ones that I like was from Adam. He said, \"I know broccoli is in there somewhere along with wings and pizza.\" Then there was my chicken wings, Pizza, Sushi, broccoli, Patillos. That's good. Some people are getting it, but the majority of people are just like, \"Not well-known,\" not a well-known fact. I'm your best friend; I don't know. I'll tell you one thing right now about the cashew: Tell me more about it. It is the best nut; the cashew, like the almond has nothing on the cashew. What are you **** talking about? The almond's the best. No, the almond's the best. Is the healthiest. Everyone thinks it's got the most fiber; the almond has the most fiber.

The nut meat. Well, nice nut meat, what up yeah and uh I like the work that goes into pistachios because you can get the pistachio nut meat itself but that's it see like I could just eat that bag you can I can just buy nut meat yes you can also buy similar to how you can buy like seeds from sunflower seeds you can just buy the seeds but it seems like it defeats the purpose no yeah you can just buy a giant bag of just the pistachio nuts.

That might be one of my underrated foods. And a lot of people think pumpkin seeds are unhealthy. They always go, \"I'm going to the game, eat the sunflower seed.\" You should spit out the sunflower seed; you look cool spitting it out, but don't do that. You look gross. I get it. I like to get the pumpkin seed and eat the whole thing, shell and all, which is totally safe. Pumpkin seeds, yeah, yeah. A lot of people are like, \"Why aren't you cracking the pumpkin seed?\" I'm like, \"What's wrong with your mind?\" Yeah, no, you don't do that. Are you nuts?

So this sounds like a copout but celery dipped in ranch dressing is the best thing in the world, period. But, oh man, any of this stuff - I just want to dip it. This is what I came back to: it would be easier for me to be skinnier than I thought it would be because back in the day, once I did an experiment where I took a packed lunch and I brought celery because I do enjoy celer - I think it's an underrated food. You're right, I don't know about the negative calorie thing but it's fun to eat, it's good, I like it.

Um, what if Reese's peanut butter made a **celery** career out of this? Oh, oh well, something's happening. The problem I had though is that it died; the entire Tupperware was red, and I was like, \"Well, this isn't sustainable.\" The celery is a good choice. So here's my thing: the celery guacamole connection. You don't try it often, but when I go to Mexican restaurants because I don't like to load up on chips, but I love guacamole, so I always ask the person, \"Hey, can you bring me a side of vegetables with the guacamole?\" So I could just... cuz then you're not full by the time your entree gets there.

In fact, I hated hot dogs. I was a cheeseburger guy all the way, and everyone in my family was too. And then when I got older... not one person in the family liked anything but cheeseburgers. Then, when I got to college, my buddy Doug - who I lived with for a year, a good friend of mine - he was obsessed with hot dogs. We were poor, so like he would just eat hot dogs.

When I meet someone who really doesn't like onions, I want to kind of kill a man when I hear that because I'm like the onion is so essential in so many foods, and garlic too, that if you're gonna deny yourself the onion and the garlic and all these different things, whether it's on pizza or on a burger, God, beef with onion, a burger with that Bermuda onion, that slice of Bermuda onion, that pizza with peppers and onions, that sausage with onions on it, that hot dog comes out.
