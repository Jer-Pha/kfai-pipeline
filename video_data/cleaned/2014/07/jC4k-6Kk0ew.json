    "description": "Going to Greg Miller's favorite restaurant of all time for the first time? Here's what you HAVE to order at Portillo's.\n\nWhere is closest Portillo's? Find out: http://www.portillos.com/portillos/locations/\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=gameovergreggy\n\nBuy our shirts! http://www.districtlines.com/gameovergreggy\n\nFollow Greg on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\n\n---\n\nHey--\n\nAs many of you know, my favorite restaurant on the planet is Portillo's Hot Dogs. Hell, I bought a wiener dog like the one in the restaurant's logo and named it Portillo.\n\nIn 1963, Dick Portillo started his first hot dog stand -- the Dog House -- and over the next 50 years, it has spawned into dozens of locations around the Chicagoland area. There are even a few down by LA, one in Indiana, and a couple in Arizona.\n\nAnyway, as much as I talk about Portillo's, one of the most common Tweets I get is what a visitor should get on his or her first time. I try to respond to each Tweet and even have blasted the order to all my followers with the message \"FAVORITE THIS TWEET IF YOU'RE EVER GOING TO PORTILLO'S,\" but the 'What should I get?\" Tweets keep coming.\n\nNow, I can just send them to this vlog. Below is the order. It is a lot of food and not my regular order, but it's the order I suggest for \"This is my one and only time at Portillo's.\"\n\n1) A hot dog with everything.\n\n2) An Italian beef with hot peppers and mozzarella cheese.\n\n3) Cheese fries.\n\n4) A chocolate cake shake.\n\nNow, if you're a Chicago native and are warming up to comment below that Gene & Jude's is a better place or that visitors should go to Wiener Circle, STFU and GTFO. Portillo's is home to me. Period. When i go back to Chicago, it's the one constant. Walking into the place reminds me of after-school lunches with my grandmother, when the North Ave. location caught fire and my parents woke me up to go watch and mourn, the same order I've been placing (two hot dogs ketchup, mustard and pickle only) my entire life.\n\nI'm not a hot dog connoisseur -- I'm a Portillo's devotee, and I always will be.\n\nGreg",

So ladies and gentlemen, these are the four things every Portillo's first timer needs to get. So the deed is done, the food is here; it's time to show you the four items you have to order from Portillo's on your first visit. Number one, it's the chocolate cake shake. I'll open it up there, you see it; it's a milkshake but then it's got Gina's - no, that's incorrect - it's actually \"Gina's\" is not correct, it should be \"gotta\" or more likely \"get\" as in \"you gotta try this\". However, I believe the intended phrase is \"it's got a chunk of chocolate cake ground up put in there.\" That's what it's all about; it's delicious. And immediately you get a giant chunk of chocolate shake, chocolate cake in there - no, that's not correct either - it should be just \"chocolate cake\" - it's actual chocolate cake chopped up put in there into a milkshake. It's goddamn amazing. But here we go, the order we get right going first off, of course, this is Portillo's bag; this is what I grew up with; this is how you knew you were a true Chicago kid if you brought the leftover...",

You're going to Portillo's, it's a hot dog restaurant; it says it everywhere - the logo is a thing that says \"For Hot Dogs.\" You have to get a hot dog if it's your first time at Portillo's. I'm assuming once again you've never had a Chicago hot dog. Chicago loves its hot dogs, makes a big deal out of them. There's a very specific way to make them. You got to get a Chicago hot dog; you got to go up there and see - you want the Portillo hot dog, and you want it with everything. That's the standard Chicago style for a hot dog: you get the poppy seed bun, it's steamed; you get the Vienna Beef frank in there; you get onions; you get the relish; you get the sport peppers; you get the pickle spear; you get your two tomato slices; then you get a little bit of mustard on there. The big thing is then they added celery salt - this is a trick of the trade, they call their seasoning. You put it on there, it's delicious. Here, the thing about Portillo's is you're allowed to live.",

Here, the thing about Portillo's is you're allowed to live your life however you want. I'll tell you this right now, it's a confession: it immediately means that I'm no longer a Chicagoan, but I want you to know when I go to Portillo's and I'm not giving you the order you need to order, I order two hot dogs with ketchup, mustard, and pickles. I know if you're a Chicagoan, I've just been disassociated with you for the rest of my life. Ketchup does not belong on hot dogs, they say, but I don't care, and neither does Dick Portillo; he's an amazing man who made an amazing restaurant, which is awesome, and so he'll let you put whatever you want in there. I got to take a bite, oh my God, it's one of those things I don't do often, the everything, but when I am, I'm so happy because you know I'm not a big fan of the onions, but when they're mixed in there with the relish.",

But again, you could just add that, you could just get the chocolate shake, you could just get the cheese fries and be done and say that's enough. But ladies and gentlemen, you only live once, you're at Portillo's for the first time ever, you can have it all. One of my favorites is an Italian beef sandwich. Now you can already see the grease from the Italian beef, the gravy leaking through. Remember that Simpsons thing where Dr. Nick said if it turns the paper clear, you know you're on the right way to weight gain. There it is, you can see my fingers through it, you know you are in trouble town. But it doesn't matter because it's so good. Now the Italian beef normally would",

Now the Italian beef normally would just be amazing - spiced beef sliced and put on an amazing hogi roll for you. I say that's not enough for me, so what I do is I put on a whole bunch of hot peppers. I say I want the hot peppers; you can do sweet peppers if that's your thing instead. I go hot peppers, and I also put in mozzarella cheese. Now if you get a look at it, you can see how gross it looks, but... how amazing it tastes. Let me get right in here. Like, your initial reaction obviously is like, \"I know my face is covered in juice; I don't care.\" The second reaction is, this beef tastes really good. Second reaction: oh, there's the hot pepper, there's the cheese - they get together and they just dance for you in a symphony of flavors that is... it's a thing of beauty.
