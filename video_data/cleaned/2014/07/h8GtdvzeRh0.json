I was coming home the first thing I talked about to Colin about it because he was the one gentleman who had to miss it. I was blown away that at the Game Over Greggy panel, everyone talked to us about Game Over Greggy things. It wasn't about IGN; it wasn't really about video games; it wasn't about The Gauntlet that much. There was some of it obviously, but the majority of it was just like everything we do on the show, which was awesome to see how much crossover. Only seven people in that room didn't know we were... like, didn't watch the Game Over Greggy show; randomly stumbled in and were like, \"Who are these people?\" That fat guy? Awesome!

Why does organized crime exist in the United States because prohibition, yeah so that is the only I thought you were going to say the Italians I'm Italian so I can say you're Italian I uh Pro you know prohibition or organized crime was a is a direct product of prohibition one to one no one would ever deny that and when you make things hard to get you criminal Enterprises will fill the void there's no such thing as a there there being no market for anything there's a market for everything whether or not it's legal",

I don't know if you guys remember the poster cover of Aladdin, but he's like the biggest part of the thing. Yeah, he's the biggest. He was pissed, but then he was like, well, Aladdin's a big deal. And then there was the Aladdin cartoon that had a crossover with Hercules, and there was an episode where there's a crossover, and that was awesome. Did Steve from Full House do the voice of the main character in Aladdin too? Because he did the voice in the first one, I'm pretty sure.
