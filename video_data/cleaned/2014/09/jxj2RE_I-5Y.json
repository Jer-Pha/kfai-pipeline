I've always, it's always been a really important part of my life and one of my favorite things to do, although less now that I'm older and I'm just not as fun anymore is uh because I used to actually it's surprising but I used to actually be a lot of fun um was I, I love going to shows when I was in high school and college. I used to go to shows all the time, probably like two or three times a month um go to a concert, small concerts, big concerts, and I'm just kind of curious what your guys' like kind of seminal live concerts were in your life maybe even one or two really terrible concerts that you've been to. What acts were that you enjoyed when you saw them and why it was important for you to see them and all those kinds of things so I just kind of wanted to throw that story out there because there's nothing better than a great live show like",

I've been to scores and scores of concerts and a few of them have gotten to me so I just want to see what you guys think. I uh, I've only been to a handful of live shows because I've never actually considered myself like I'm not hugely into music - I love music but it's not something that I would mobilize to go out to a live show because it is a financial commitment and it's time commitment and you have to make sure you get tickets and if it's at the right venue, seats and stuff like that.
