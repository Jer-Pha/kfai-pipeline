Uh, been listening a lot to that Currency record, uh, the Stoned Immaculate. I know who's Currency is so good he's a rapper from New Orleans, and uh, he's just so good; he's just that that record front to back is just really good. Anyway, so listen to that, the Stoned Immaculate. Um, my topic is board games. Typically, you know I when I was a child I like to play a lot of board games. When I'm older I like to play some war games and stuff like that, some more in-depth games like like Axis & Allies or uh Shogun: Total War, which is out of print. Um, so I want to talk about board games. Uh, what games we played when we were kids? What are some of the seminal and most important board games in your life? What is the best board game of all time, and I'll start you off. Uh, I really love Axis & Allies a lot like some of the more complicated War Games even like you know again like Shogun.",

That was... going back to Monopoly for a second. I don't know that I've ever finished a game of Monopoly. I should probably have because I feel like all of my friends who were good at Monopoly are like, \"Make a ton of money now and like no business.\" Yeah, you know? Monopoly nowadays has like ATM cards, yeah, credit cards, so you don't even need to deal with all the like cashing out and stuff. It's just like it keeps electronically. That's amazing. That's one of the fastest ways to speed up Monopolies, you know, sit there, account, and debate and stuff. That's something we should do in this... We should play a game of Monopoly. One video that goes up because it's crazy. The problem with Monopoly is eventually someone quits. Eventually like people get tired and they're like, \"You know what? We're just going to...\"",

We're just going to do an alliance and screw everybody else.\" Then you're not really playing a game anymore. My property and all right, so here's the thing about Monopoly: it's an old American game that comes from The Landlord's Game, but it comes from an older game called The Landlord's Game. What's cool about it is that there are just a myriad of house rules, so like the game doesn't have to be long. In fact, if you play it with all the house rules, a game can last 30 minutes. But Monopoly is a special game; I'll play Monopoly anytime, anywhere with anyone. Like I love that game, and I've finished hundreds of games in my life. I used to play in college all the time and get all hyped up with my friends. Were you like me where you'd get super offended if",

Like, you decide to play Monopoly, you're playing and there's like a bunch of strategy to it about getting the Reds and the yellows, especially or the oranges - like there's certain strategies. A lot of people go all in, there's auctioning, or you don't have to auction, there's all sorts of things, like Community chest, free parking, all those kinds of things. So I really appreciate Monopoly and I recommend it to people. I think it's on Netflix, there's a Monopoly documentary about professional Monopoly players and it's like really, really awesome - these guys are crazy and uh they play, they watch, they play for money, and there's another one about professional Scrabble players too.",

We used to go to this place called Cafe Ruben down in Orange County, in Costa Mesa, and you'd be open till 2 o'clock in the morning. So we didn't when we didn't feel like drinking or have money for it, we just sit drink coffee and play these games. And none of us figured out until way too late that you could actually get Trivial Pursuit: Hollywood & Pop Culture Trivial Pursuit, which is way more fun 'cause we knew all of the stuff. But that came around late; people won't remember that now. But Trivial Pursuit was hardcore for a long time. There was nothing fun about it. It was all I know you're Mr. History, but no. But it was.

I mean, we'd just straight up play it. We'd get into it, like the first time you ever tried, and I've never finished a game of Trivia Pursuit. You sit down, you get into it, like \"I don't know\" and every other person at the table is like \"I don't know either,\" and it's like, well this isn't fun.

You all you need is pens, papers, and a bowl - like a big bowl. I know this. And you give like different pieces of paper to everyone. Everyone rips them up in like little sheets and you write each person - like writes 25 or 30 names on them so it'll like it could be a fictional character, a movie star, a president, um, a band anything like that. Everyone folds them up puts them in in it can be like a team of like two teams four and four whatever. So there's like a couple hundred things in the bowl.

K does have a problem though it's like it's it's super good but then I feel like you get stuck too much there's too much it's like Tic Tac Toe amazing game except for the fact that it's always a draw half the time it is unwinable like it's the reason why Checkers is whack because there's just because there's just so like just too many ways to manipulate the game you know there straight up there's too many ways to manipulate chess or Checkers and there's too many ways to manipulate Connect 4 like you.",

Why wouldn't you? You know, like just eliminate four ways to win for your opponent right off the bat. But right, four ways... yeah.

But it's awesome that you remember that game. I'm going to tell you guys a quick story about Monopoly though - it's a central story. Come at me bro.
