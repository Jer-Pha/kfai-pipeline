Greg, yeah, I know you at least love Starbucks breakfast sandwiches. That's true. You've been there when I order two. I don't know what your thoughts are on Starbucks. So let's start with you. Um, I don't drink coffee but I do enjoy like I go there on the airport over I'll get like a muffin and like an orange juice or something like that. But I don't drink coffee. Uh, otherwise I don't really have an opinion on Starbucks. Um, it's like a painful inhale. He was ready for that one. Yeah, uh, yeah. I don't, I I don't know. I think that they're like a lot of people look at them as like a predatory kind of store um like a small Walmart kind of but I think that the service is probably pretty good the coffee the product's good everyone that I know that drinks coffee likes it so does it terrify you at all though that there's a Starbucks on literally every corner something that",

It's weird like I kind of wish the mom and pop stores were like some viable competitor would come out. Because you guys, you guys don't you know live out there but in New York, it's not quite like that. Um, York donut, Dunkin' Donuts. So they're Starbucks, but they're they're definitely Dunkin' Donuts is definitely the prevalent brand. Starbucks Dunkin' Donuts out there is like Starbucks here where they're literally Starbucks and then they're literally Dunkin' Donuts that are across the street from each other right? It's just like hot the traffic actually you know mandates that people aren't going to cross the street to get coffee here they're going to go there so you have to have them right next to each other.

PS, I mean I was I was down from year one. I must have been going to Starbucks and getting these things but I don't remember it all that well. That was my first initiation to it then drinking coffee for a long time. Do you mind if I ask you to go back what were the circumstances under which you had the first Pumpkin Spice Latte? I was walking, and I think I saw a commercial or a sign for a pumpkin spice latte, and I was like \"it wasn't like in the door\" you weren't like Christine didn't get you in there. I'm like \"you got to try this.\" I didn't know her 10 years ago so no. Wow it's good point yeah so no it was just that I knew something pumpkin flavored was",

You announced you have a buffalo chicken pizza? Here's my money; give me the goddamn pizza and I will be the judge of how good this is. Throw your wallet across the table so then coffee for a long time has been a necessity for me, right? Especially when you know it wasn't an enjoyment act for a long time; it was very much a fuel. I'm drinking coffee at work, you know what I mean? I'm drinking coffee at home; I'm doing it because I want to wake up, I want to be on point. I like coffee; I'm not like into it like now, I'm into coffee now. I enjoy... I like walking on the street to the mom-and-pop shop here in Sunset, I get a nice French Press there.

Here's my money. Cancel. Put it in my wallet that night.\" It got hacked. Woke up the next day - $600 in Starbucks charges on the app. I have no idea what happened. What password was moved or received? And I was like, \"Well, I'm officially done with this app.\" Like had to call them and go through PayPal, and do it. Honestly, you know how people always say their identity got stolen? It was so easy. This was very easy. I just called PayPal like, \"This happened. Oh no, big deal. We'll refund the money. We'll investigate.\" Oh, here two days later, you're fine. I'm like, \"Oh great. You know what I mean?\" But like that was enough for me.

Now on the other side, they did start this program where they're basically paying for all their employees to go to college. I don't know if you guys saw that thing last month.
