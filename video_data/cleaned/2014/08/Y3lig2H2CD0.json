He likes I want we're we're about to go on this for a while. Nick, do you know where New Zealand is? I want to say now I don't know 100%, but I want to say it's near Australia. It is; it has to be yes, it's south of Australia, right? No, no, southeast. It's one of the islands, right, like by Australia, right? It's like it's like a ripple; it's New Zealand and then there's another one that's right by it, right, like what Tasmania or whatever I don't know. It's an archipelago or something like that, right, archipelago, whatever. See, I know this. New Zealand is two big islands. Big Island singer, oh okay, I know she was from New Zealand; I thought she was from Australia because when she talks, she kind of has that accent. I'm like, \"Oh, that must be near.\"",

I'm like, \"Oh, that must be near there.\" The only reason I would know about New Zealand is there's so much to unpack with what you just said, but we'll just dial it back. They pay in the globe; they show New Zealand next to Australia, and I'm just like, \"Huh,\" I did not know New Zealand was there, and in my head forever, like, like I tweeted this. I, you know, I'm very honest about my flaws right? I'm stupid for not knowing this. Don't get me wrong; this is one of those moments where you're like, \"Man, I can't believe I'm that dumb,\" that I I cuz like I you know I tweeted about it Colin wasn't even sure if I was serious about the tweet people were going people were going back and forth on Twitter like you can't be this stupid right?

Yeah, it's like down and around here, but here it's right about there, yeah. You go over from France up and over from France, like where Belgium and the Netherlands are, yes, okay, okay. And so I always thought it was there, and so what you said that was very funny is like they had the same uh accent as Australians. I knew this never don't tell someone from New Zealand they have the same accent, they'll get pissed off. They're weti for a second because we're all going to get back to the same point here real quick: it never dawned on me that fact that I thought that that was there, that like the fact that why would these people have Australian-like accents is that fine?

And so I didn't tweet anything out angrily or anything 'cuz I'm wrong, like I'm wrong, I should know where this is you know what I mean?

I don't think it's because of The Lord of the Rings a lot of Americans know for because I think all this is the thing that actually really got me because I was like how is that possible you know like it was one of those things where I understand that some people there are things I don't know and there are things everyone doesn't know yeah but when I think about the world I know where basically every country is generally sure you know like you'd be really hard pressed to name a country where I'm like I don't know somewhat or pretty specifically where it is I get mixed up like the Philippines and things like that like where those are all the islands stuff.",

New Yorker guy coming out, one construction worker. But I think like there's a lot of layers to this problem. But I took all the same geography classes you guys did and I passed them and did well in them, but I memorized what I needed to memorize for the test and then said \"erase it.\" Why do I need any of this? Yeah, see I think I know where like Mount Gagazet is in Spira from Final Fantasy X way more than I know things are, and that's messed up.

It's just that I don't know, and I don't have a good answer for you other than I studied general geography. I remember getting extra credit in geography because I knew whatever color you had to fill in on the map for some random place \u2013 no, not some random thing; it was green. Yeah, done good enough.

Internationals were offended again that I didn't know New Zealand; I'm dumb, I'm you're dumb American, which I I've always said I'm a meathead American from the middle of the country. I think there's something to be said, and this is what I was talking about earlier, I want Colin's opinion on this: the fact that the United States is so vast, there's so much going on; there are 50 states right here. The fact that if you're just England, if you're you know, you're the one like small, you're like the size of a state, you know what I mean? It's easier to",

The thing that the thing that uh fascinates me though is that you know, I guess you mean Northeast Europe so you mean like Scandinavia, that's where you thought New Zealand was right, so like not Northeast of France which we were talking about before but like going all the way around to like towards like Russia or towards the Baltic states and **** like that.

I don't really judge it. It's the same thing I was thinking with planets though. Where I honestly have those conversations with people sometimes and in my mind I'm like, 'Are you for real?'

You know what I mean? And people tweet about they like you're telling me that you met Lucy the lion O'Brien from IGN, and she's like \"I'm from New Zealand.\" I'm like, \"She probably said that,\" and just it never even registers.

It's the same thing when I became a journalist, when I was working at The Daily Newspaper. Right? I literally had to... When I I discovered early on that if I didn't come home and have a pad in my pad and pen in my uh pocket, I would forget things. Because I got so used to you asking me the question, you respond, and I write it down. And like that's what I remember when I need the article. That when we would just have a conversation 30 minutes later, I would forget what you told me. I just wouldn't even... Like your age, like you know what I mean?
