Pell, you got to go, I'm about to get serious. Oh, he's not going to go; he's going to come right back. He doesn't go; he walks under the table, people see him, they laugh. Uh, Tim, you know that I fly pretty much exclusively Virgin America if they go to a city, I'll go only with them. You and I both love the freaking Fly Miles; we're big Elevate members. I'm Elevate silver, it's a big deal for me. I'm going to plan on begging them not to take that away at the end of the year.
