For other reasons we can do another top about Heral one day cuz I I can talk about Heral all **** day because it's **** awesome, it is awesome. You want to talk about Poison, don't even M.C. or is that or is that too mainstream? No, no, that's awesome.

And then I'll never be as excited about a movie as I was when I was like nine - maybe that's just because I was nine. But in the 80s, also you were seeing new stuff all the time, like Jurassic Park blew my mind: \"That is a dinosaur! They got a dinosaur; they grew it up; they fed it humans and then they trained it.\" Steven Spielberg trained a dinosaur to be on camera - the beauty of Jurassic Park, by the way. This is a tangent, but it's just like that movie still looks awesome; it looks good, and it's because they didn't overthink it. It's like all real; you know what I mean? It's not like it's not like it's obviously not real dinos, but it's just like Spielberg and those guys - like understood posterity, that like the movie would look better if they didn't mess around too much.",
