See that's a hard one 'cause my mind immediately goes, \"Use it instead of booking those Thanksgiving flights.\" But I tend to gain about 10 pounds at Thanksgiving no matter what due to the fact that my mom not only cooks the traditional American Thanksgiving but also does an Italian Thanksgiving, which doesn't make any sense because the Italians don't, as you know, Colin, don't celebrate Thanksgiving; it's kind of an American holiday.

You're using \"cat\" to mean cat, right? Where this isn't a euphemism for something else? No, you sick! No, I just didn't know if this is like cat clubs where you go to it's like a strip club or something like that. This is legitimate feline animal that's sitting next to you, yep.
