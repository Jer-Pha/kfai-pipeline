Here's what I want: I want to give a shout out to a pie restaurant, a pie organization I just discovered when I went back to Columbia, Missouri, Peggy Jean's Pies, Peggy Jean's Pies. Now, the thing about them is they're amazing pies. We discovered that they have this crazy story: they had been open when I was in school, but I obviously didn't know because I wasn't going on many bakery trips when I was in college. Then they closed, now they're back better than ever; they ship nationwide. They do the whole thing where they make the pie in a jar, then they cook it in a little jar and then they ship it to you, and so then you open you have these little pies and these little jars. Yeah, I'll bring this in for the taste test next week. This sounds amazing; they're amazing pies, really good. It was nice to find a little local spot. This is what I'm talking about: is that what we did? Is that what we were going to do, barbecue that night?",
