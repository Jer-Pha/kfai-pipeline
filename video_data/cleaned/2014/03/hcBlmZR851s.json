So we were talking about it wasn't last week, I think it was the week before, we're talking about uh movie lines right and then the week after we started talking about movie trailers. And I realized there's a great line in that that really kind of struck me as it's a very powerful line - it's the Russell Crowe line that I talked about, I think it was last week or it's his parting words to his son right, in The Man of Steel trailer. The Man of Steel trailer and it got me thinking, I'm like what if the Earth were dying and I was the only person that knew it and I had to send my newborn son out? What message would I say to him? What would be my parting words? Why would you even do say **** **** to him? He's a newborn, he's not going to remember. Well, you know, he gave him the message right, like he's like this hologram guy - which I don't think I'd have the tech, I don't think I'd have the attention span for. I think I would just want to do",

He'd be like, \"How is he going to watch the movies in another world?\" But the thing is, he watches Furious will live on; do not worry, great. He watches them, but it doesn't snap until he's older and he's on his deathbed right? And my father was an ****; he spent all these years trying to figure out what the secrets of these numbers were. Was it how many planets are in this system? Is it... he's watched The Lost like 500 times to figure out if there's something in there that's decipherable, is how many molecules are in this you know they no; it's the order of these **** movies yeah I tell him to be a hero I tell him not you'd say go hero I guess I guess that's your the root of my question is would",

We were talking we had that that that thing that went around uh IGN where we're talking about what our favorite superpowers are right yeah and I started thinking about mine, every single one of them I could think of I would use for bad. See I would use for a negative thing I would use for my advantage which inherently is a trait that a villain has, villains use power to their advantage. Superheroes use power to to you know benefit the lives of others, that's the way it goes. My superpower that I chose was was to be to be able to morph into a better looking man and that might be altruistic but I really don't think there's there's no real way I'm I'm using that power other than to get on this I don't know if",

So live long enough to see yourself or has like you know the no, like I don't think like I don't think you know the greatest villain of all time is Shocker. Put on his suit and was Bane - Bane is the greatest Batman villain, but in the Marvel Universe, for yes he put on his suit to be bad; no, he put on his suit and he was like \"I look pretty good in the suit.\" Hey, I got this; I look like a booth at a steak restaurant. I don't know if you know the story of Shocker is that the floor of a Vegas casino; it's amazing. The story of Shocker is that he was a p he worked at a power company and he was and they would",

Because to be a superhero in any universe sucks most of the time.\" He probably thinks, \"I'm going to party with this guy just like we do in real life. You came in, you never had alcohol, you never had sex, you never did anything crazy, you didn't even stay past 10. You met Scarpino, you met Mor already, the Italians double-teamed you.
