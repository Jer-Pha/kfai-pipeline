If you like that, there are a number of ways to get the show, and it all starts each and every Friday when a new episode both in MP3 and video form posts over on KindaFunny.com. You can go there; you can get on the Patreon page, exclusive access, you get there; you can get it there. We got a bunch of different perks and stuff we'll be getting to in a second.

He likes if that suit were like plastic, it wouldn't read right. So we found a rubber compound that would do it. He goes but then we wanted the thing that sells metal effects is that you have to have reflections. Right? Reflections are what sell anything, makes it look like metal. The more reflective it is, the shinier surface, more metal-like it is. So he's like we'd have to go around and put lights, like flashlights strategically all around the set just so we could have the right reflection so this thing would look real. And he's like and then we also had to follow these rules of you know when you're shooting Robo, he calls him Robo, he's like \"you know shooting\"",
