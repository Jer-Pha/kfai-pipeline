Oh, okay, he's freelancing reviewing it for IGN, and and he returned to me ease memories of Selsun on Vita and my DualShock 3. You **** it all up, yeah, give it to me again. What game did you give him? NBA 2K15. Oh, here, that one's a slam dunk. God, you were on fire! Man, morard Miller, buy your shirts right now. Oh, uh, so I forgot to mention this before, but it's October now. Uh, so I want to thank everyone for supporting our Patreon. Um, I'm I'm you know we're super honored and humbled by your support of of our Patreon, and we want to really impress you with what we're doing. And the good news is we've been talking a lot, we've been hanging out a lot, the four of us, and uh Tim's not here obviously tonight, but you know obviously he has great input too, very knowledgeable.

Like, that one sum of money and with that sum of money they've done so much right. Like, his argument is that the distribution of spending in the global economy today, particularly here in the United States, is so skewed where we think we don't have enough money to spend on things like space probes and stuff, and it's really kind of stunted the growth of Mars. I think the problem here is that we would be a lot further along, certainly by 100 years, be a lot further than Mars in our own solar system if we could fix the social issues. Like, if we could really figure out what is you know stop playing for the quarterly report you know uh simultaneously technology is moving so quickly that by 2050 the world is going to be not recognizable at all right well no it'll be fine we that's the same thing people always happen like we always",

Well, that was 70 years ago, and some people think that like nuclear signatures are probably one of the first things that can be detectable too, so that's 1945. So you know, there's only 60-70 years for these things to pulse out now. When you think that there are only a few stars relatively that are around us that are that close and things travel at the speed of light, it's going to take forever for like one of these signals to get...and not just get to a place where someone receives it, then they have to receive it and figure out what to do with.",
