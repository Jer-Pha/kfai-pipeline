We have well, that was the thing. People, of course, on Twitter will tweet me and be like \"how can you call him like this?\" I'm like, well, we actually tweeted about this a day and a half ago, which means no one can see it; it's you'll never see it again. So here's where I'm coming from with this, and this is what I wanted people to explain. Maybe you guys can tell me what you think. When we were at VidCon this year in Anaheim, we started talking about how can we grow our channel at the time which was Game Over Greggy, it wasn't Kinda Funny yet; we hadn't settled on that name before Tim Gettys came up with it and we talked a little bit about like well could we",

And then those channels bear the burden of having to have 24-hour programming seven days a week. It's it's a nightmare. Now we've got services and HBO is very much leading the way with this, but actually I give it to Netflix as the creator of all this because they're the ones that first made the subscription model really work. I don't know how I've been a Netflix subscriber for maybe two or three years, and really yeah, I've been it's been for a while. I like I thought that was short; no, no, no.
