Wait, now, let's go back to when you say \"low budget\" because we're used to internet terms here. Well, people, we're used to these kinds of walls being low budget that really fall on Greg. By Fall, I thought that was real; Stone there, like, thought it was Castania. You laugh until one of them falls on our head, that's all right; that would be comedy. We want it to kind of be like in Smallville when the Fortress of Solitude collapsed on you and we thought you were dead but then there were all the clones and then you came back at the end of...

We were all going to go and film this movie in Pittsburgh. And then two weeks into prep, this is independent movies, oh watch the movie, you'll learn how to do that, they just said, \"Uh, pre-production says we lost the money. We lost half the money.\" So I went into a... You know, not a fit, but I was just emotionally a mess because I don't like to let people down. It was on my watch, and I was getting all these friends, and they kind of dropped the ball. So we tried to get the money, try to figure it out, but it was just too much to get that much money.

In two months, I was prepping the movie in Indiana. I mean, unbelievable. Think about that. I mean, we were ready to film one movie, it gets just... we lose all the funding, and then we switch gears.
