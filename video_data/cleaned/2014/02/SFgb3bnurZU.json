Okay, um, and some untrained workers probably in there right, some untrained artists, you know, some untrained workers. You got to have some trained stone masons now the big issue from where I'm at is getting all the enemies right, this is a huge problem and I don't know like I don't know the answer to this question yet but I have immortality so as long as I just stick with it presumably see I'm already in Eastern Europe I can somehow go to Chernobyl right I can bring like all sorts of normal people and animals there and just lock them in Chernobyl for as long as it takes 15 or 20 years, go back and see what happened to them yeah bring them back to the castle and then strategically lay them out in such a way now this is the thing that I have to I have to really pay attention to it must be",
