He doesn't have the Scarpino sense of humor; he'd be a really bad it would be a conundrum, yeah, for sure. I don't know if like, would it would it help you get to talk to your wife about it too?

We have to understand and they say in the show it cost $25 billion in 1969 to go to the moon it's an extraordinary amount of money today um how much is that today, that's what are we looking at almost half a trillion dollars probably Jesus, trillion it was worth it though so that's the thing is like here's the positive to me there was a a whole generation of people that were that were wondering right they were they were in the math and they were in the science they were in the rockets and space exploration and science fiction and they had they it was the Last Frontier as they say in Star Trek, it was like the only place we hadn't gone yet you know we were going to go to the Moon we were going to we were going to do all these crazy things we're going to risk.",

And that it would cost us to go to Mars realistically, like really go - like we're going to build the craft, we're going to train everyone, we're costing hundreds and hundreds of billions. Let me put it in terms that I think that everyone can appreciate. There's a little movie that was made not too long ago, oh man, called Armageddon. And in that movie, we use all the tech, all of our technological might to save our species.

The Earth on Star Trek is for all intents and purposes very peaceful; it's one Federation, I think. It's not one person, but rather one people - I don't think there are many governments, just one government.
