It's a dangerous place. I was watching Mad Men; I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, the last episode of Mad Men took place concurrent to the moon landing \u2013 spoilers and uh 1969 made it; the nuke didn't go off, no they made it there was no Soviet base on the Dark Side of the Moon either like we thought there was going to be. That was more fascinating; I didn't know that story. And so I was thinking about you know there were two interesting themes in that show that again are not spoilers but I'm sorry you know maybe you want to tune out if you're really worried about it one was like the wonder at that time in 1969 people everyone gathering around in the United States and around the world to watch Neil Armstrong and Company.",

It's an extraordinary thing when you think about it. Yeah, cuz like to real quick to bring it up, I guess this is maybe what you're going to talk about too, but I it's something I always take for granted. I remember my mom explaining to me especially now in this day and age where you send Rovers and you're getting all this imagery back people didn't know what they were going to really find right that was the thing they didn't know what the surface of the Moon really was. Yeah, there was risk of them thinking they were going to sink into the surface when Neil steps off right he talks about like you know there's like a few inches of dust and very fine powder yeah yeah it's really cool so was thinking about that but then one of",

They had it as the Last Frontier, as they say in Star Trek. It was like the only place we hadn't gone yet. We were going to go to the Moon; we were going to do all these crazy things; we were going to risk everything for the biscuit. Is it worth it? And should we still be doing things like this even though we have real problems here on Earth, and it would cost us hundreds of billions of dollars to really go to Mars, realistically?

Let me put it in terms that I think that everyone can appreciate right there a little movie that was made not too long ago called Armageddon. In that movie, we use all the tech, all of our technological might to save our species. They say they have a great line in it that I'm going to slaughter and paraphrase: \"For the first time in the existence of anything, any life on earth, a species has the ability to save itself from extinction.\" That's because of that moon landing. That's because we had a competition a while back that gave us the technology that allowed us to save our lives. So if we don't keep... if we do not keep on that path, we might be causing ourselves just utter... see, that's the bigger thing to me is like the way we sit here and talk about it right, like the prospect of a probe on Venus or uh investigating an asteroid.",

I remember them making a big deal about when they launch the planet, the planets align and you launch everything, and then they're far apart, you don't know. It's also I mean like I just wonder if you know we complain about money spent. I do, I mean I'm definitely a conservative and like I I don't want money to be wasted but when people really aim at NASA or they aim at the National Endowment for the Arts or they aim at PBS or they aim at all these things it's like come on, like government shouldn't necessarily have to fund culture and art and science.

Can you imagine what we could do with Apple technology, what we can do with all the things we make on Earth for practical purposes if we just said, \"We're going to spend the money to do this, and it might not be practical.\" Maybe we get some minerals and some rocks, and we learn a little bit more about space. But maybe it brings a whole another generation into things that they really should be studying. I was talking to my friend Sarah recently, who's a teacher, about how I'm really frustrated that no one said to me, \"I'm so happy you majored in American history.\" You know, I went to school, and all that kind of stuff. But no one ever said to me, \"This is great that you want to do this,\" or \"This is fantastic, but historians are necessary, people.\"",

You know we need those kinds of people, and we don't have them to the point where we actually have to get immigrants to come here to fill in our high-tech jobs because no one's studying that stuff. Because everyone says it's okay, go study you know medieval English literature and get a degree in that, and that's fantastic, and you're educated, but is it practical and is it useful?

Like why do we need to change what we're studying and stuff so that we can do cool things because I think it's the sense of wonderment right, like Colin was saying, like the iconic line from Star Trek is \"Space: The Final Frontier\" - there is an a vast just infinity out there of unknown possibilities that has a sense of and carries with it a sense of wonderment that we should be encouraging in people who are growing up and in each other right.

And there are very few things other than huge catastrophes that we look at that we actually join us as a global community like that's what I was thinking about. I was trying to remember, like again in Mad Men, and this isn't a spoiler, the next day Peggy makes a presentation and she talks about it right away. Like I know you all watched that. I was thinking I was trying to think about it like what is the last positive event that we all were like \"the next\" I maybe like I guess like Obama getting elected wasn't the Olympics because I didn't even know those were happening until like Obama got elected, that was a big deal right, the first black president.

I hear what Tim is saying in the like: We got a lot of practical science from the space program, and a lot of things that you use every day come from NASA. But you know, like a lot of stuff - plenty of stuff. But like so, we don't know it's the proof in having to use it in those extraordinary circumstances. But to me, I've been reading a lot, and I have been recently about there's a lot of declassified documents from the government, and all just a lot of talk about what we thought we were going to do.
