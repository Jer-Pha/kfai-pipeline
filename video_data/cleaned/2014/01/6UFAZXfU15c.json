Every Wednesday and Friday, I take one of your questions or comments or tweets, answer them, talk to you right now about it because we're friends, whether you want to admit it or not. Uh, today's topic comes from FCB713, and why don't I have the chance to talk about FCB, one of the most dedicated Game Over Greggy fans here on YouTube? He is I, you know, I wake up at 6 a.m. to post these videos, and I'm in there for an hour with you commenting; FCB is there every time. Great, Jude or girl, I don't know, dude or dudette - that's what the Turtles used to say. Uh, his question or her question is: What's the story behind Game Over Greggy? What how did I where did this come from? The the the moniker Game Over Greggy sadly it's not that interesting of a story; no, I'm just kidding - it's kind of interesting. Uh, I played video games for a long time in my life, right? Every time I'd play a Legend of Zelda or anything where you had to make a save file or a character, I would name it Greggy, it's my",

Every time I'd play a Legend of Zelda or anything where you had to make a save file or a character, I would name it Greggy - that's my nickname, right? Greggy was what it was. So, for years and years and years, that's the moniker I went by in the Video Game World, right? So then jumped to when I was working at the Columbia Daily Tribune, I convinced them to give me a video game column and a video game blog, and that was all of a sudden we had to come up with a name for the column. And there was a bunch of goofy ones thrown around that weren't great, and for some reason 'Game Over' is the one that stuck. So I wrote the Game Over column and the Game Over blog - it was the Game Over column with Greg Miller, and so did that... did that... did that it was great, great, great. Then I got an Xbox 360, now I actually got the Xbox 360s through totally screwing over my newspaper, sorry about that Columbia Daily Tribune.\"",

Right where it was just like I asked them, \"Hey, will you guys expense me a 360 so I can write about 360 games for the paper?\" And they're like, \"No, we're a daily newspaper, we're not going to pay for a 360.\" I'm like, \"That's fine.\" So I eventually started a whole campaign to have someone sponsor it. Maybe a sponsor could get me a 360 and it would be like... the CJ's downtown Columbia Wings Xbox 360, and I would mention that whenever I talked about the 360, I would have to say like, \"Oh, it's from blah blah blah whatever business Kmart, the Kmart 360 or something like that.\" And eventually somebody bit on this and did this and bought me a 360. And I was like great, and the next day my editor was like what",

And the next day my editor was like what the hell are you doing? Like you think you didn't take a journalism ethics class, did you think? And I was like well I thought journalism ethics is supposed to protect you know people from uh journalists doing things behind closed doors. I was publicly doing this entire thing for like a month and a half so I look like quite the guy. The Columbia Daily Tribune bought the 360 from the person who sold it to me, so that it was like their 360. So I have this 360 I now tricked the newspaper into buying for me and I go home and I turn it on and it's like all right now you have to make an Xbox Live account. And so I of course tried 'Game Over Greggy' as my gamertag, but that was not happening because I was way late to the Xbox 360 thing, but what was open was 'GameOverGreggy', the game taking the video game column I was\"",
