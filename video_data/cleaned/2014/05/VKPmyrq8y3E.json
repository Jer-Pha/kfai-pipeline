Now before you guys answer, no hold on, you answered way too soon. Okay, you can't name the dick of a dick you've seen or know about. Well that's going to limit a lot of things. I know for Greg it's true. I get so you can't you can't name dicks that you know this size of or the... it doesn't have to be about size, the quality of and you can't just be like I'm good, you got to trade. So my follow-up question: M, I can't have seen the dick nope. But what about a dick like I'm going to go straight to fellow mug grad John Hamm who like they made a big deal about that one time and they had like photos of him and he was all mad at these people about it's got a Twitter but you know how big it is because people talk about it and he doesn't wear underwear so like pictures of him. Yeah, that's so does that count? Cuz I'm taking John Hamm's dick if I can. I mean you know I I",

Because certainly he makes love really well, right? Like the women talk to other but this again is back to using what you got even if I had the Dos Equis guy's dick, I wouldn't have his sexual thing.
