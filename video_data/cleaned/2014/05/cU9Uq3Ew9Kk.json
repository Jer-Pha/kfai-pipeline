I was curious about that too; this was my main concern cuz you know of course vomit is very contagious in the way of if you smell it, you... oh doctor, and I'm pretty good, I have a strong Constitution among myself uh it didn't smell that bad. Okay there you occasionally catch a whiff of it and you knew it was up and you get that thing in the back of your throat, you're like \"back to Mario Golf\" but yeah no for the most part we were all right. I was concerned about my bag; I have this I now have a garbage bag full of vomit next to me what if that spills over?

So I grew up in a small town called Riverside, California. When I grew up there, wasn't much happening in this town; it's not a bad town; it's just a small place in SoCal and the Inland Empire - the IE, as they say. The IE is what, about 40 minutes... I guess inland of Orange County if you're familiar with that Anaheim, Tim. To put it in context, the things you know, thank you. Uh, it's you can get to Disneyland about 45 minutes; uh, great town, very hot; it's a high desert, so that's a con right?

The dead man switch is you have to keep pressure on it at all times if someone shoots you, your hand releases it and it explodes. So he was dying the way he held it; it made it look like it couldn't go down. Yeah, I haven't seen Terminator 2 in years maybe that's what he was doing - maybe he was trying to hold it up and it had like... that's a really shitty design.

Uh, you can surf; you can get in the water too. It depends on which side you're on. The North Shore is Long Island Sound, and that's between Connecticut and Long Island. And you can see Connecticut in a clear day or whatever it's out there. And then on a clear day, depending on what part of the island you're on - if you're out more Nassau where the angle is shorter... um...

I was like, \"I guess I could hit that point in my life\" from my mom was like, \"Whatever, let him let him just do whatever he wants to do.\" So I'm like, \"I want the Big Mac. It's two patties, three buns right? You got the middle bun. It's a little it's a little excessive, superfluous. It does is it is unnecessary. And not only that but their bread is so dry that every bite you just feel like you're eating sand.\" Bread's not dry. Oh, it's the it's too much bread. It's too much fake bread. It's not unne... too much lettuce. I'm not a goddamn there's a lot of lettuce and it's shredded lettuce. It's not the other kind of like everything's falling apart. You feel like",

And it just goes together so well with the Crispy onion. I agree man because the only the only killjoy as it were of the Whopper is that there's too much sauce on it, so it falls apart.

My mom was allergic to bread when I was growing up, and so she used to get the Whopper in a like they used to just give it a little Styrofoam box; you just eat it right with a fork and a knife. It gets a little more sloppy. Ironically, when you're eating it with a bun, it's built to be a sandwich. But let me give you this: let me throw this into the mix. The best burger because the best burger place is Five Guys, and so the best burger is their Double Cheeseburger because it's just oozing with peanut butter, not nastin', cheese and peanut oil, which is the same stuff they make Chick-fil-A in \u2013 no coincidence, no coincidence there whatsoever \u2013 and Five Guys; you're gonna pay a little bit of a premium.",
