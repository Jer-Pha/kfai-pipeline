Martin right next to George R.R. Martin Nick kick it off this week so this uh this question is actually was submitted to us uh as a result of our topic uh last week I believe which was if aliens were to come to Earth what would happen and I think a couple of us said well I think it was Colin and said that would completely destroy religion right like it would just completely uh negate everything that was written in the Bible because there'd be another creature out there that wasn't accounted for this question is a really interesting one though so we all decided okay",

Kenny K Belo - I'm not sure what he's on Twitter, I didn't write it down here, but he's on Twitter, everybody search for Kenny Beloo. What would it take to find The Jungle Book Guy? There you go, that's him. It's that guy from the Disney film B is the Bear right? He's the one... the necessity that's the one and then in the sh cartoons he eventually becomes a pilot. Correct, yes.

Yeah, uh, I would need some irrefutable proof that he... what does that mean? Like God talking, the burning bush? Yeah, I mean like my legs getting broken.

Here's my thing on that one though don't you feel like that's a little bit of a relief though because now they can go forward with Lawrence Kasdan as a writer and write something good, they don't have to adhere to Meta Llama 3's well I guess they actually still do, don't Lucas wrote that and that is canon and so was Jar Jar Binks. Yes, Jar Jar Binks is canon. Prince Shaak Ti not canon, Dantooine not canon, Mara Jade not canon, Garm Ralor Thon not canon. Jar Jar Binks and those racist Asian Trade Federation people are canon. N'Geeo let me ask you, let me ask you a question so so like flash forward to like six months from now right and everyone's like when you're sitting in the theater watching it no you get into work and everyone goes like everyone goes dude you haven't seen it yet you got to come see it this what always happens at work everyone's like dude you haven't and they act like the thing came out 18 months ago and you're just now catching up even you're",

And that a company like Apple is very ripe \u2013 they make a ton of money on the App Store, no doubt. But they're ripe on new technologies, and if they don't find that new technology really soon, uh, they're going to be a very old-school Apple again because you know the tides are changing; they're losing market share with iPhone; they're losing market share with iPad.

It was I mean it's a I remember the day I got my first iPhone and it's back to what you're talking about. I mean I remember I used to have the stupid flip phone still; I had the RAZR till I had the iPhone, and it was one of those things like when I got the job at IGN, it would suck to come in in the morning, you know, leave at 5:30, 6:00, 6:30, come in in the morning at 9:30, 10:00, and have all these emails right.

I sold my car the night Barack Obama got elected the first time, and the next day we walked in with that money and bought an iPhone, like that's what I did, that's what I did with that money, you know what I mean. And then from there on out, I had an iPhone, and that was like, what we're talking about right, like that was a huge investment, that was like buying a computer right, it was like what $500, $600, the first iPhone was $600, and that was insane. See, I didn't buy the first one, I remember still $600 sure well but now we before was $600, like no matter what, no matter what yeah but I remember when Craig Harris got it, Craig Harris was the first guy I knew to get an iPhone or whatever, and it's like mindboggling to see this thing and then slowly understand why you needed it",

I mean, honestly, I'll tell you right now, sound it to me. The next piece of technology that I think is super cool and I'm going to wait several iterations is Google Glass. Oh, when Google Glasses... you can go into a store and buy whatever glasses you want that then can give you an overlay of stupid information. Yeah, hell yeah. Give me that's so weird to me like I don't know if I need that Google Glass. When I see someone with Google Glass, I'm like \"Colin, you know better than anyone we don't need any of the **** we have.\" Like think about it, if the EMP went off tomorrow, what do we really need?

I think the next iteration is having all that information right on your wrist. I hate wearing watches, so I don't want to wear it and I think I'll get more information here. I see... I think that's just going to cause more car accidents. Oh look at that! I'm going... oh see or not? I don't know. Like I often think about it - like with how Google Glass works, with the speakers and stuff being able to give you GPS directions. Just kind of seeing what you're looking at your phone, you're looking at your thing... if it is there, you just got distracted. I don't know. I think my attention span would be like...

So the birthday party I was at when I saw the Razer commercial was in El Cerrito, which is in the East Bay, it's kind of near Oakland.

All of us are getting on BART and then we're going, and like you know more and more people are getting off the train, and we were like almost near Richmond, which is not a good place. And um there's this guy; he just looks at us, \"Where you going?\" We're just like, \"El Cerrito.\" He just goes, \"You're going to die.\" I was like, \"Make sure you get off before Richmond,\" good luck.
