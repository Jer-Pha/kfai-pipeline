He asked for a birthday shoutout about a week and a half ago. Oh, it's also Christine's birthday today. Also, it's also Christine's birthday. Yes, happy birthday, happy birthday! Uh, mine's pretty simple. This is a topic that did not come from Twitter, but if you have Twitter topics, please tweet at me, Nick Scarpino, and maybe they'll make it on the show. Um, if not just follow Colin. My topic's weird; it's one of those I think about this a lot because I go back and forth on this: is it better in today's society, in today's society, to be a guy or a girl? Guy, you think guy yeah, I think it's easier to be a guy yes well that's what I'm going for by far right but there are certain advantages to being a girl I think. Oh yeah sure Lex, what's your take on this since we have a girl here for the first time we can actually broach this.",

Am I wrong in assuming we all look forward to going to the bath? Yeah, I love, I love a good, I love a good poop, but the problem is, is that, and this goes back to my stomach issues, is that some of the poops are not good; a lot of the poops are bad. The good poops are better this way, but then I wish the good poops took a little more time. See, sometimes I go in with a book or I go on my laptop, sometimes, and I'm like, you know, I'm ready to go, yeah, you're ready to go, and then it just...I'm like, what the ****.

I'm convinced that when women, like good-looking girls, go into the bathroom, all they do is check their makeup, and they come right back out. That's exactly right; that's exactly it. Perfect. Make sure they look good. I mean, I always love to think about it. We never want to burst the bubble. It's like it's like the 70s book \"Everybody Poop\" tear it apart. I love it.
