You've only got five photos and videos on your Twitter. Can we make up Roy Zing's backstory please? Do yeah, like remember that the show uh with the shark people in the 90s Street Sharks. Street Sharks, yeah, yeah I'm sure Street Sharks was his favorite show. He was really big into it. He didn't like the main one though and he didn't like the like the other cool one. He liked the third one that no one remembers their name. MH, where did he come down on uh like Saved by the Bell versus 90210? Oh nice, he just didn't watch either. He versus California Dreams. Oh California Dreams exclusively. Uh I want to point out that the second tweet here on Roy's page is a retweet from Michael, he retweeted Michael Rosenbaum so he knows what's up. He does know. I say I want to say he's a huge fan of Bel Biv DeVoe. I'm not quite sure you retweeted me too but",

I'm not quite sure you retweeted me too, but yeah, I think he's a huge fan of that. Yeah, um, loves DVO man, DVO. That's it, I was thinking a you're right, I love you're definitely right about that. Really like he retweeted Colin very selective about Metal though, you know what I mean? Colin, yeah, I mean stainless steel is his favorite, right? Yeah, he likes heavy metals literally; he likes heavy metals but doesn't like Metal or Megadeth. He likes Alkaline Trio, remember them? That's almost every weekend at bars, but he fights dirty so he wins every fight. Uh, but he's the character that you can get behind when he does that, you know? Like he's not the kind of guy that you're like, \"Oh, that guy's a cheater; I don't want to align myself with him.\" He fights for the good cause, but he's not afraid to cheat to win Eddie.",
