He's doing that, PE yeah, it's weird at IGN peeing with Nick. I like it; why is it weird? I don't know. I just want to say it's weird to pee next to another man, but I enjoy it a lot. That's the whole thing when people don't talk; Nick talks to me the most in the no. Nick is a chatty Kathy in the bathroom; I love it, I love it, it's good. I like Nick; never tell him to face go to the bathroom together a lot. It just happens that I need to pee and he needs to pee at the same time, and it's fun.

Though, like, for me, I went through that - I wouldn't even call her face it's like a lifestyle choice of like me and all my friends; like, Jordans' Nike shoes are such a big deal to us when you get new shoes, it was like, \"You need to walk like a penguin, make sure you don't crease those **** getting them dirty anything like that.\" Okay, so that's break.

So I know the proper way they should wear out: where the sole should become bald when the little metal thing starts tearing away from the fabric.

Oh, was Kevin what a surprise. Kevin does more harm than good on this show lately. He no, he's the stuff he...what he reminds me of is stuff he gave me $9,000. He said $3,000 at first, then he cried to himself, \"$9,000.\" Yeah, just kidding, Kev. I love you. He's an idiot. I love you, Kev. Don't do the thing and sink away. I was always...I was always responsible, I think, because I did have an older brother keep me in check, and he kept me in check not by being responsible but by being really irresponsible and then making me clean up after whatever that mess was. So I told the story once where we used to throw parties, and he used to let me party with him, but I'd have to clean up afterward. So no matter how hung over I was the next day, I'd have to wake up and clean the party and stuff like that. He was just brutal to me when I was a kid.",

He was just brutal to me when I was a kid; he hated me until about the point where I was 16 and could drive and go get him stuff, then we started to bond, and then we started to party together. It was fun, but I think...I don't think...I mean, I had a lot of those sort of nuances or idiosyncrasies that you guys are talking about, but my brother just beat that out of me over the span of like seven years. He used to just torture me because he was way bigger than me. Actually, no \u2013 I take it back; the reason we became friends was when I got older and weighed more than him, and the first time he tried to arrest me to the ground, and I...like Jiu-Jitsu'd him, like I just threw his shadow box paid off, yeah. Because I used to do like Taekwondo, so I just grabbed him, put him in an arm lock, and he's like, \"Uh, okay, we're gonna be\"",
