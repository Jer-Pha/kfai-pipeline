What's up everybody, I'm Greg, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff, so every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at him; he has no idea what's on the cards until I read them here. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to us on YouTube, and please share it with your friends - it means a lot to us to get as many people into Colin's craziness as possible. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is spiders. Oh no, this one was submitted by @pyes on Twitter. There, um, you don't like spiders. No, I... I did not know this for a long time until you brought it up just out of the blue one day. What's your deal with spiders? I hate them; they're horrifying. Spiders are horrifying. You're like... the weird part about this is, and I'm sure this will break Mike Mitchell's",

How are the spiders the ones that are like the roadblocks to you being a full-on dude? I like that talking to the landlord is one of the manly activities that I do, that's he calls you Mr Colin, he doesn't call me Mr Greg, setting the bar really low, uh I don't know, spiders, um I don't I wouldn't say I'm like...

An interesting thing is that my old roommate Scott Bromley, who used to work with us, and he does a very popular podcast called The Comedy Button - subscribe to it, um... I used to live in this apartment with him for a couple of years; his ghost haunts these holes, and I used to make him kill the spiders for me. Um, so he's been in my room many times to kill spiders, so how did... how like that's the thing we've lived together now for a year almost a year and a half, how have I never been brought in to kill a spider? I don't know; I've never... knock on wood, but I've had no spider encounters in my room since you moved. You think I'm scaring him off me and Chloe maybe? I kind of think that it might have something to do with the animals, maybe Chloe in particular actually okay since she sees something.",

I think spiders are actually generally not aggressive at all, but yeah, um, yeah, I just, I'm, I'm horrified of them. So it's actually an interesting topic because I, I don't want anything to do with them at all; the fact I'd prefer if we stop talking about them now really, yeah, really. No, I was going to say like that's weird; it's like the ghost topic where I thought I was going to call them in by mentioning them you're worried you're going to call the spiders then, yeah. I just don't... You had a bad experience where you tried to squash a spider and it made a move on you? Well, no, I've certainly lost a spider or two when I've tried to kill them in the past, and then you're... It's over after that because you're like, \"Where is this spider? It's plotting.\"",

So it's kind of like... you know, in a medieval town, there'd be a head on the pike at the gates. Well, there's just a spider \u2013 a few spider corpses on my wall \u2013 just in case. I don't know; it seems like it might be working. Because, of course, there was that famous episode of Lost where the spider put out a pheromone that called in more spiders when it was squashed or whatever. That'd be my fear: I'm not scared of that.

There are a few of your friends that I've... demolished, and you can go tell their families that you saw them dead on this wall here. Maybe they'll teach or maybe maybe the children of that spider will now come, you know, train to come and get me. Oh wow, that'd be awesome if there's an army of spiders out there getting ready to kill you. Here's the scariest spider moment I ever had: okay, I was after college, I lived in this apartment building. I was on the second floor, came into a floor one day and saw a spider crawling on the ground. I was like, \"I'll take care of this,\" and I did the old foot squash on it.

Ladies and gentlemen, did you enjoy this conversation about spiders? I know I did. Like the video, subscribe to us here on YouTube, but most importantly, share it with your friends so everybody gets involved with how crazy Colin is. But then in the comments below, leave suggestions for what you want to see in the pile, just like \"pies\" did here. Come on, come up with better YouTube and Twitter names though, cuz I don't want to say these weird things all the time. Uh, we'll be back every Tuesday and Thursday with a new topic from the conversation pile until then. I hope we have a conversational day. It's almost too accepting of everything else that's going on around it, saying like well we all kind of believe in the same God, we just get there in a different way, like that's... all your gods are fake.",
