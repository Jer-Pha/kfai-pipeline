Across many, many, many movies over the course I don't actually know, and they keep adding them, Greg. There's a new one coming this year, Prey: Bad Blood that's why we're doing it. What it's happening? Oh mhm, I've never heard of this. It's happening. Yeah, I don't know. Is it like a Prey thing? It's the guy that did... yeah, they're like I think, and I think it's theatrical right. It is, and then they're supposedly well, I guess we're probably not going to the series but they're supposedly like Alien: Earth as well which is going to be rad. Thank you for bringing that up though. We will not be doing the series this is uh us reviewing ranking and recapping every movie in the Alien vs Predator franchises we will be doing this in release order a lot of people have been asking about",

Cuz remember Lionel Newman, brother of Alfred Newman and Emil Newman; Uncle of composers Randy Newman, David Newman, Thomas Newman, Maria Newman, and grandfather of Joey Newman. We got to save this cat, Joie. Andy, let me ask you a question: You're in this situation right? You go back for the cat... no... no dude, a catat... like... anyway, the end sucks. I saw this and I was just like, \"I don't care if it's Patel I'm out.\" Yeah, see you - you know what I mean. We got bigger problems going on here. Yep, I'm why the alien leave him alive?

Also, that's my favorite shot in the whole movie is when he like it rack focuses from the cat in the cage to the Alien realizing that the cat's like leaving and the Alien has to leave, it's cool cool stuff man. Uh, this one had a budget of $1 million on a box office of $187 million. In terms of Awards in 2002, Alien was deemed culturally historically or aesthetically significant by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the United States national film registry in 2008.

I think again so funny uh you know for what a movie is in 1979, what a movie is in general, what this franchise goes on to become right like such humble beginnings of such a small character piece you know I mean a sci-fi film to its core an alien that like appreciate it don't you totally Embraces even when he's like all tired on the Escape show you know",

And so for him to look at and sort of be inspired by New Hope and inspired by 2001 and be like \"What if we did... what if we could take that into space and basically make Jaws in space, which is how this was pitched?\" Um, and then have it be as good as this movie is and as iconic as this movie is and then as enduring as it is is just a testament to how awesome that crew was that worked on this. And I just give a shout out to Sigourney Weaver for just being like \"hard\" not hard carrying the movie but being just like the Ripley character in this, specifically obviously Ripley - one of the most iconic heroes basically of the Silver Screen.

So cool! I absolutely loved it. On the Kinda Funny scale, I'd give it a nine out of ten because I think it's such an incredible 1979 film; I can't believe they pulled so much off, but it's not without criticism.

Another great choice by Ridley Scott.

They're talking about like past this, what's this? I want to rate... whatever subtitles can't even keep up.

Giger another one was a guy named Syd Mead another one all these great designers and production designers shut the **** up super cool right all of them did all this great concept art and then of course that movie fell through and so Ridley kind of took a lot of those people some of them went to like the next Star Wars but a lot of them came over to work on Alien but Giger was definitely like known for this of over like crazy violent sexual phallic",

I remember talking about that on a Kinda Funny podcast a long time ago. It's it's it came out a while ago, I think it came out pre-pandemic, but it's cool because you see all of his like he did the ship design for Baron Harkonnen in and it's like just a face, it's like hitting the Baron's face with like... and then the people would come out of its mouth.
