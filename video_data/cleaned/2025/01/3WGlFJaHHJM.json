I'm one of your show hosts, SnowBike Mike, and today I am joined by both of my gaming dads, Mr. Parris Lilly and Gary Whitta, of course. For you watching and tuning in, whether you're listening or watching over on YouTube and podcast services, this is the Kinda Funny Gamescast for your Friday, January 31st, 2025. But we are taking over with a whole lot of green and a whole lot of smiles on this fun xcast themed Gamescast so let's get down to it, Gary welcome back! I feel like I'm in one of those dreams where you find out years later that there's like one test that you didn't take and you got to go back to school. This is the final Gary, this is it right? Oh God, I'm back why am I back here? No, this is good, this is it's always good to be with you guys just a little bit weird right because xcast has been done and dusted for a while and yet\"",

Like, the Switch obviously we've been there for a while, like we all have been waiting for the Switch to be announced, you know, play but PlayStation just put out a Pro, like a mid-cycle console, you know. Xbox has added some refreshes, but I don't know, I kind of feel like how long's the Xbox been out now? Well, you saved that for 2020, right, so 2020. So I feel like these cycles generally last around 8-10 years now, so I don't feel like we're necessarily in the home stretch yet, but maybe I'm wrong - that'll be the fun part of the conversation. We'll talk about console, but we'll talk about the games that are coming your way most importantly. But of course, we have to welcome in our other gaming dad; he's remote, it's my main man Parris Lilly, hi Paris, how are you? I'm good, man. I am still recovering from probably the worst",

Do we think that Horde mode multiplayer will be in this? We see so many people talking about live service games, and a lot of people are kind of wanting to push away from that. Do we still see Gears as a hey, this is a full product - you're going to get single-player, you're going to get multiplayer suits as well? I'm really on the fence about that one. I don't know... I guess you can't imagine a Gears of War coming out without multiplayer, so I'm going to lean towards yes, you do. But at the same time, it would shock me if E-Day is just a standalone story for them and they can consider it we're going to tell you the story of E-Day... we're going to tell you the story of... um...

You drafted me on this; you think about it. Where do you see them? Cuz they need a fall title here; they need that end of the year fall title. Yeah, and is that a Fable? Uh, is Outer Worlds 2 big enough to bolster your second half of what could be a great year or is it maybe Gears Z Day? But see, that's what I'll go back to: Worlds 2 isn't big enough to be this. I mean, look, Call of Duty is constant, so that almost doesn't count in my opinion. So, I feel like Outer Worlds 2 isn't a big holiday game for them. I mean, you could argue last year they had what Flight Sim, Stalker 2, Indiana Jones. If Gears were to come this year, Gears Z Day, then okay, yeah, that would be big enough to be your holiday.",

I do think it's more so of the engine, the character assets, and how like Gary is saying, the quality of the animations in like the faces and stuff still looks just like blocking and camera movement and angles \u2013 it just feels very regimented",

I don't know exactly how they're going to do it, but I do I do agree that the next generation of Microsoft Hardware has to have like a \"wow\" factor that's not just about more compute.

So, there are all these different things that you can see Microsoft doing in terms of non-exclusivity around games, the whole \"more games to more places\" this is an Xbox increased focus on cloud, all that points to if they're whole strategy is actually kind of joined up together and coherent, that all points to them doing something like what we just described on the hardware front to support that.

If it's not a PC, it is truly an Xbox. And when I say that, my entire Xbox Digital Library is available to me - first party games, third party. So whatever I could do on an Xbox sitting at home on my TV, I can do it on that handheld. That experience is there on that handheld. All my digital games are there on that handheld. Obviously, you bring Game Pass into it; I can subscribe to that, and I can play those games on it too. But it is truly the Xbox experience.
