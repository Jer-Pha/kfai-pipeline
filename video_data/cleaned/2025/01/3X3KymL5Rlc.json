I look at these visual fidelity, yeah, I look at the visual fidelity, I look at these assets, I look at these characters and I'm like, \"Oh, I don't like the jaggies,\" I don't like how rough some of these environments look. I play Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and I'm like, \"Why does it look like this?\" Like, what are we doing here? And so I've always been excited for it, but I will say I don't think the Switch to hardware reveal got me more excited necessarily. I think for me, it'll be software-driven, like we gotta get to that Nintendo Direct to let us know what the software is going to be because I think sure enough we're gonna get one or two or three things that make us go a snap.",

Horizon, of course, it's about Aloy, but there is a world there that I think you could see a business person looking at and going, oh we can do so many different things with this.

God of War might be too adult, too mature, and like we don't want to, we can't make a Lego game out of out of God of War. Um, same thing with LoU, right? Maybe even same thing with Ghost of Tsushima.
