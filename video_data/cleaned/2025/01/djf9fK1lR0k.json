Where did we go wrong with PlayStation Vita? You and I love the Vita, you know we love it. What happened? Oh yeah, well, yeah, there are you know multiple reasons right? Why be that didn't work?

Where did we go wrong? Was it the back touch? The touchscreen? On a positive side, you know when PS Vita started, you know Mark Cerny got brought on, and our team started joining. And the original idea for the so-called core processor, yeah, was a different one, and that was going to be a failure from our team's standpoint. And Mark was able to convince the team to change the main processor, so that was a very first contribution. And you know we did a lot of conversations, discussions, making prototypes, and several technical choices as a company made, which didn't really work out well. One of which was the like a dedicated uh memory card, right? Yeah, proprietary to purchase.",

It just doesn't make sense; it's a really bad idea. Right? So, the team removed that feature just to save a few cents of cost from the hardware. But I think the biggest reason in my mind, not a popular kind of thought, but I think the biggest reason the Vita didn't do as well as we had hoped was that we had to split all our efforts and resources into two different platforms. Sony didn't have the resources, we didn't have that um resource pool so on PS3 and PS Vita or PS4 and PS Vita, you know, the studio had to decide which team to work on which, and we didn't have that big talent pool to be able to support",

PS3 and launch of PS4 really, we had to stop many projects from Vita because we didn't have a team to make PS4 games, so otherwise, so I I I think that's the biggest reason, and and I think you know it's this is another personal thinking uh one of the reasons for the big success of Nintendo Switch is they uh stopped you know making working on two different platforms. They always had you know console and handheld right, and uh, and it's like opposite of us.

            "text": "who created beautiful hardware and the latest that I enjoy using, the Ion Pocket S - it's not PC, but it's a Android device with two analog sticks. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the GPD Win 2, you know. If you're an audio listener, this is a laptop there, a laptop that has dual sticks on top of a dad, yeah. And then the Ion Pocket S is an Android device with two analog sticks and all the gaming buttons, and it plays games beautifully. These recent mobile games, uh, some games are real action games, right? Yeah, and yeah. So this Android device you know plays games so well, so that's the category I buy one or two new hardware every year these days. So of course I'm so excited if a PlayStation in the future makes something like this. However, um personally, you know because I said company you know even now PlayStation is much bigger than you know PS3 days but I don't think it's it's a good idea to try to manage two different platforms like PS",
