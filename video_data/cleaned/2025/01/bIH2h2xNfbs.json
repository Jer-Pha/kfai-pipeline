Are you guys going to be nice to me at all or is it just going to be pure chaos? No, that's a hard pass. And I'll tell you why: expectedly, which is why I've been drinking espresso martinis for the last hour and a half. Joey, I'll tell you why we're not going to be nice to you. Look at what I'm wearing. Remember, you were like, 'I might have gotten a little revenge.' I hope you like it. Oh, I don't care what character I play as. I was like, that's perfect; that's exactly what I want to hear. You got to leave it up to fate now. The thing that I did not check is whether or not we needed to unlock characters on Mario Party before. Oh, it's fine. I don't have to play as this character.

I want to thank everybody who believed in me. I believe from today when I won stars in the car when I got a bunch of tattoos, including an A Garfield one. The CEO Junior, who never doubted me, that's what I'm talking about. How do you feel about Greg's under nipple? Not, I mean, let's just... I mean, sexuality. You know what I mean. Hot, hot game sees game. So like it doesn't matter what into or not into but like every chat was the same thing: \"Underbob\" is hot, that's hot, under undeniably hot. Thank you very much. This I thank everybody for 10 years of me winning somehow because this is the true story of Kinda Funny. We just... I think time after time I should've taken off your underwear right now. No, that was it. That was if we screwed it in a very specific way. We didn't screw it that way. Everybody chill, chat Satan.",
