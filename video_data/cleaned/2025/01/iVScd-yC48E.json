And regardless of how depressing it gets, there's always that sort of feeling. And I was just super drawn to it. And for whatever reason, it just worked in that moment whenever I played this game. This is typically a game I would never ever try because it's a lot of reading and there's no dashes, no there's no parries, there's no... yeah, that's what I was going to say if you're watching it obviously but if you're an audio listener, yeah, it's this interesting visual novel but",

Whatever I did in Dragon Age: Inquisition, even in having a catastrophic ending with all the choices that I was making, I was like, \"Wow, I really loved what I experienced.\" And then I started up a new playthrough and I saw different dialogue choices, and suddenly I saw the cringe that reviewers are talking about. And I saw things that weren't lining up, and I saw things that didn't feel earned. And I'm like, \"Okay, now now I start to see why other people's viewpoints.\" That's not a you know, I'm not trying to excuse the writers here or whatever.

It feels like there is one singular ending, but there are a lot of like... one A and one B and one C sort of like okay shades to it side endings to it.
