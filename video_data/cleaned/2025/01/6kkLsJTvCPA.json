It's an annual tradition that we love and call Fantasy Critic. I have talked at length with Blessing; you are the commissioner of the Fantasy Critic League. What is Fantasy Critic if folks don't know? Yeah, Fantasy Critic is a game where we each draft a bunch of video games that are coming out throughout the course of the year and we compete to see who can draft the best team of games based on what their score is going to be on OpenCritic. And so we go around... we have 10 slots to draft 10 games today for the opening draft, we each will draft five, and then over the course of the rest of the year we have our um we have money budgets yeah we",

Cool, I don't know what you're doing over there. No, I mean, there's a bunch of little Manu right so we draft five games today and at the very end then we draft a counter pick. The idea being that Andy, everybody has to draft a counter pick, so you look at the game you think will perform the least good or be the worst game somebody drafted, you pick that. The idea here is that on Open Critic, for every point one of your games gets above 70, you get a point for your score if it goes below 70, you lose those points for, of course, the counter pick. The idea would be that you're hoping it's below 70 so you would get the negative point somebody else would get and above 90, yeah, it gets crazy, you get two points, yeah, per which is crazy that really well for you, huh? Did it did yep, so the strategy again for picking your actual games right you want to go",

So I, I have a question if I can go back to what Blessing was saying with the Remake stuff: so if Oblivion remake comes out, does that not count? So okay's finessing that right now. Yeah, so we have uh certain band tags and allowed tags, and I think I figured this out now, right? So right now the band tags that I have are games that are currently in Early Access, so yeah Hades 2 wouldn't be eligible; something like that director's cuts and so something like The Director's Cut that we've gotten from PlayStation wouldn't be announced ports, so something like Doom 2016 for Switch wouldn't be would not be uh eligible, uh games that have been already released internationally wouldn't be allowed, and then",

Ys VIII was a JRPG, I think he means Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, no that's not it either...  I'm pretty sure he means Yooka-Laylee, yes that's it.

I look at Indiana Jones and the Great Pyramid DLC, I was really trying to hide that because I do have a belief that that could be and is probably the right counter pick when we're talking about low scores here. So yes, that's my 12 points no matter what, no 12 points, take it to the bank. Can I show you on a game called Kingdom Come: Deliverance too, Andy? I tried to get you on that one.
