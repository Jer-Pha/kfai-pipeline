You go in there, you fight the enemies, you get the currency, right, and then of course since it's Rogue, you're opening up chests on every run getting new things. But what's really interesting about it is when you start it, you have to create your path, and as you play, you create your path so you have a bunch of different rooms you unlock that you can put in there, and they can be filled with enemies, they can be filled with treasure, they can be filled with hearts if you need that or whatever they cost you a certain currency that you're getting as you run through right. And then you make your path to the boss every time or to the other things to get it does what I and a good Rogue like where you know you fail, you come out, you're back in the Overworld, right, and there's all manner of things to do - cool.

So suddenly you're here, you can't hear in the game; everything's got no color; you're taking more damage, stuff like that. So they really tweak and play with the things I love so much about like Rogue Legacy, where it was okay, cool, like you know you come back as this character, what's the pro, what's the con of them, how are you doing it? So you can get stronger; you can stick to it; you can put down just the enemy rooms to get the currency to do the thing. But what I found with mine, of course, is like oh man, I'm taking hits and I want to have as many hearts so I need to put down heart rooms real quick before I go to the boss. There's also in the skill trees you go through and unlock all the stuff, the normal stuff, more Health whatever, but you also can unlock configurations of rooms, so it's like all right if you put down tiles in",

But you also can unlock configurations of rooms, so it's like, alright, if you put down tiles in a way that makes a plus sign in the middle of filling the free heart square. And so it's like they got a lot of really neat stuff they're doing with tweaking it. It's not a 10 out of 10 by anything; it's a smaller game obviously from a small developer, but I'm really enjoying my time with it. It has been one of those that even when I'm doing something else, I'll be like, alright, well before bed, one run, uh, watching TV, watching wrestling, all right, let's jump in there go through another run of this and see how many I can do, what can I push, how far can I get. And you guys know that I'm not the D'oh Perry Prince of Persia kind of guy; I guess Perseus isn't correct for this one, but you know this is about oh it's these Candlestick guys that are coming at me so I know that I need to you know do my dash through",

I look at this like oh man again Tim loved Prince so much yeah I look at these two of like are you guys impressed with this? I'm I'm blown away that Greg is recommending this game, this is not a Greg game that I would put on you Greg so nice job way to step out there you got to get out you know you get this whole thing I want I want to be out there I want to play some yeah at what point does the main character talk about his dead daughter or something?

Is you just go and fight Candlestick people. Do you find yourself uh in any of these runs in the middle of a run or at the start of a run discovering... like one of my favorite things in Roguelike games is once you're kind of starting your run and you get those first couple upgrades, you go \"Oh this is going to be a this sort of run.\" Oh yeah, this is going to be a fire run. This is going to be a lightning and whatever run. Like I love knowing kind of going into runs at like hey maybe this one isn't going to be successful but I can make a",

I like a roguelike, I like the idea, the concept of building the world out as you go and like being able to make those choices like that but then I look at the gameplay of it and for some reason it's not doing it for me right. That doesn't look like a world that I want to be in. Yeah, 100% I think that's a great point, I think it's a valid one. Where I would say yeah, a takeaway I would have again is that then I think it also makes it feel generic where it is like again, who is the architect exactly?

So Miyazaki University is the new one that I'm going to introduce into the lexicon of Kinda Funny.

I think last year maybe up for debate between uh Black Myth and Stellar Blade - I wouldn't count Urery because Urery is like an actual FromSoftware game but I would give it last year to maybe a Stellar Blade.

Yeah, but I think that that nugget there could evolve and maybe you know get something out of me. And then uh, I think my other thing too is man, I hope to see like the world get more interesting, like the environments get a bit more dynamic even, like the pathing um, I think after the beginning became a bit more straightforward and that might be because the demo takes place in a more like foresty area so there's only so much that you can do with pathing. Um, in the very beginning of the demo there was like a cool part where you kind of drop down, you have to like look down and see where the next ledge is to drop off to then continue, I thought that was good level design but after that it felt like that stuff",

I want to see that stuff uplifted more in terms of getting me invested in the pathing in the level design and bringing that part of it too. My one other thing is, uh, like in any of these games when you get down to a stagger, you have like your finisher or like a visceral move or whatever you want to call it. I'm not feeling it; it's not hitting for me like that specific move. Like there's a plus what about it? Is it not looking good? Isn't it fun to perform? It isn't satisfying.

The Stellar blade kills were fantastic because it was always some cool shortcut scene that had her jumping up and doing something crazy, and it was always kind of enemy specific, yeah. Um, so yeah during boss fights that was a lot more appreciated I would say, yeah. So like here it is more you'll do like a harder hit or whatever and you'll knock the enemy away but I kind of wanted a bit more out of that, that's a small critique but that was one that I think stood out to me the most of like oh man I wish this was more.\n\nI corrected phonetic mistakes and spelling errors, especially for names and pop culture references.

I think my initial impression of it, of what we played for 2 or 3 hours, um maybe like 2 hours 'cause I think we switched to Dreams, but my initial impressions was it felt like it was trying to throw too much into the pot, like it felt like it was trying to do too much for the type of game that it wanted to be. Because when this game was initially revealed, I got excited because it reminded me of games that I like, I love, right, like Shadow of the Colossus, right, like they have the giant beast that you climb and then like you know fight against, and I'm like oh they're making their own Shadow of the Colossus style game. But then I look at other elements of it and there's this really cool like you know um like element thing of there's fire there's",

Right? You even see the climbing in the game in the video that we're showing right now. Like, so much of it reminded me of Breath of the Wild in terms of those things.

And so whenever I hop into Minecraft, I got I don't know a goddamn thing about it because I've played you know a handful of hours over a collective five years of my life. And I just, it's a pretty cool video. So anyway, that's all I got to say about Minecraft. A lot of fun, yeah. Minecraft Mondays, yeah. We're going to beat Minecraft. Uh, Minecraft Mondays. Uh, tune in everybody. The issue with Minecraft: we've always jumped in and we have the one once a year you get a week in your life where you're like I just want to play Minecraft. I want to devote myself to Minecraft. So that's where we're at right now. But every time we play all we do is build dope Mansions, so Washi will go, you know, go get a bunch of sheep.

Uh, and so this time around, we've decided we're going to beat Minecraft. So we have the goal of we're going to fight the Ender Dragon. Oh wow, we will go to the Nether, we will fight the Ender Dragons; that is the rule. So keep an eye on us trying to do that. It sounds exciting. The year is 2012, we're talking about \"Legends\" in Minecraft, and if Kinda Funny only plays the hottest games, we are playing the you know right on the pulse of everything.

It's a game I bought and wanted to play on a flight, then fell asleep on the flight, so I never got to play it. But the sequel came out this past week, and it has a lot of good ratings so far on OpenCritic; everybody's getting like nines and highs. I'm so mad that this one wasn't even picked up for The Fantasy Critic, yeah, because, yeah, this debuted in '87 or some other year, just kind of popped out, and even my replies are people like, \"Oh man, the sequel's out already.\" Um, and so I decided to start it over the weekend on my Steam Deck, and I'm having a good time with it.

But as far as Metroidvania goes, it kind of immediately opens up fast travel and double jump and air dash and all that stuff, and it just really fun to play so far. In addition to when you're walking, you know, it's not just one of the Metroidvanias that's only like I mean it's always 2D side to side scroller but then you'll walk upon one area where you're looking at it and there's a hallway that kind of runs deep that way. So then you can walk through there and then it becomes another area, so like there are walkway entries that are kind of like north and south, you know, and so it'll open up new spots and then you'll find bunch of cool secrets and things to upgrade your abilities and your um you're constantly finding",

But then you will use money to buy like I don't know, I always go with the word Talisman because Elden Ring's kind of the most recent version, and you can buy Talisman slots, and some talismans will cost three slots, and that the three-slot Talisman might be like get health back on every kill or whatever. So right now I think I have like nine Talisman slots that I've bought and upgraded, so I have nine slots that kind of fit either four Talismans or three depending if they're super expensive, and those will be you know your sort of passive stuff where it's like oh now your combat is 15% stronger when you're in the air or you have",

I was like, \"I could go play Eternal Strands.\" I'm really digging this though. Let me go back to... Ender Magnolia Bloom in the M. So some context for you: this has a 90 on OpenCritic, damn.

But a lot of these enemies and characters are all 3D models that are just it looks so 2D but the characters are 3D models that rotate and have like depth and dimension to them.
