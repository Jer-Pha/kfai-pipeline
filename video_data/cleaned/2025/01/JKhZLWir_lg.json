My first thing was games that I completed, I needed to have rolled credits on them or I would not have it on the list. So as an example, Metroid was not on the list because I didn't complete it. Um after that it just comes down to fun factor how much fun did I have playing this game was it something memorable about it that stuck in my head that carries on after I roll credits why I still think about",

Why I still think about it could be the story, could be the gameplay, art design, level whatever but something memorable about it that stayed with me and that's how I catered my list. Gotcha, yeah you know I really hate top 10, top 25s, top 50s and to a degree game of the year as well cuz I hate the arguments and I hate because when you start arguing about it right it always feels to me that it's come down that well no we have to objectively say this is the game of the year and it drove me crazy at IGN and obviously Kinda Funny is a way different beast and what I love about the way we do Game of the Year especially in the blind is the fact that these are the 10 games for each person that matter to them for some reason yeah this is this is what defines their 2024 and I think that is for me at least having been at",

I'm like, \"It's got to be Journey.\" Like Walking Dead is a great game and experience; it is broken, it is buggy, it is this...like I for me when I was like IGN putting their stamp of approval and saying this is Game of the Year. To me, when I worked there, meant that like in 30 years you should look back and be like, \"Oh, that was this amazing game.\" And I wouldn't want somebody booting up your game and it crashing every time Lee climbs the ladder, which was one of the issues, right? Whereas with this one, I come in here, and I'm like, \"You know, yesterday it was revealed at the end of our thing...of the games on our top 10, which are more than 10, which we'll get to in a second. Only two of those were on my list.\" And to me, that doesn't invalidate my list; it makes me so excited that I played different things and",

Uh, number 10 was a tie between Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Tekken 8. Number nine was Dragon Age: The Veil. Number eight was Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Number seven was Hades 2. Number six was Animal Crossing. Number five was a tie between Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. Number four was Batman. Number three was Metroid Prime 4 (Fantasia). Number two was Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. And number one, our game of the year, was Astro Bot: Rescue Mission. Paris Lily's Kick It In Reverse.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good that campaign was and not on my shoulder too Ben God dang it. You know the multiplayer is what it is now they've obviously had the Omni movement itself into it now but the multiplayer a lot of fun great Friday Saturday night sessions you know with the friends having a blast with that zombies was really good and I never really had been a zombies person before but playing that had a lot of fun in that mode too very polished high production Treyarch and uh was it um Raven yeah, Raven. They knocked it out of the park. I thought it was again one of the best Call of Duties we've we've had. Did this surprise you?

Um, again if you go back to like the original Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I mean yeah those were all in my wheelhouse, but I had definitely fallen off Call of Duty, I would say over the past probably eight years or so where it was like yeah I'll check out the multiplayer, campaign wasn't really doing anything for me. But this campaign was really good as you strip in front of me, it's great. Hey man, I look at this, I'm like there's got to be a line for how much of my son's bodily fluids I can have on me, but but no. I mean that that pretty much sums it up.

But this one was really, really good. So now does this inspire confidence in you that next year you're going to see another Call of Duty on your list, or do you think this is like a... I would hope so, but it wouldn't surprise me if it took a step back. Got it? And that's the curse of the yearly release of Call of Duty - where you've got to have one out every year. Yeah, of course, of course. Okay, fair enough. I like that pick; I'm glad it resonated with you and stuff. Yeah, uh, for me, my number 10 is Path of Exile 2.

Path of Exile 2 is that the top 10, 10th entry for me because it's fantastic, obviously, uh, but mainly because it is early access and it came out late and I haven't I didn't get to endgame with it and all this other stuff I've played a bunch of it - I'm wowed by it and I'm going to stop I think until it is time for the next major update or here we are, we're fully launching the game.

Like I think so much of that I'm able to say and do because of course I had no baggage about what Dragon Age looked like before or who characters were before, or all this other stuff. I thought they gave me a great introduction to what was going on with Solas. We were off to the races, and I was having a blast.

I think the game's failing points for me is the fact that there should have been more choices; you have a giant one at the very front, I think there should have been like two to three more of those to really make it branch out. Branch out. I understand how hard that is; I understand this game didn't start as this game when it was being worked on that way.

It is time to reveal our number one picks, and they're the same game. So Paris take it away; I mean, it's Astro Bot. Yeah, um, I've been pretty vocal since it came out in September about how much I've loved this game, and at first was kind of tongue-in-cheek going asot game of the year but then I started to realize oh wait no this is Game of the Year; this is my favorite game that I've played this year. Yeah, for what we were just talking about is just such a video ass video game that I love.
