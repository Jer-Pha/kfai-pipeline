It's interesting 'cause yeah, is my only Xbox Studio that don't know about right. Like Ninja Theory we just had Hellblade 2 so they're off the list. Uh, Mojang right they're making Minecraft unless they make another Minecraft spin-off with another Studio which they have done I don't think they're on my list right now. Uh, Rare with Ever Wild. We've technically seen Everwild. So does it fall into that bucket? Turn Ted Justin Forza he's in Discord he's going to turn it on Undead Labs at State of Decay 3 so like those are your proper Xbox but announced Aaron Greenberg out here.

MachineGames is doing an indie DLC, so that crosses off all my Bethesda stuff now. We get into Blizzard Activision, not the strongest with them, they're new, I don't know what their studios really break down into, but I would say this: there's been a big push for COD to go every two years, there's been a big push of hey there's some great studios there, what if we let them make their own IP? What if the chat is saying that the ZeniMax game is Starfield online was the rumor, what that's... I don't know anything about it. Can you imagine Starfield online, Greg Miller day one.",
