I am thinking if you're talking about Johto, you might be on the same wavelength as far as a Let's Go Johto game. That's the thing I would be at this point utterly shocked if Let's Go is something they go back to. You think done uh I think that that was trying to ride the the tail end of the high of Pok\u00e9mon Go and Pok\u00e9mon Go just doesn't have the sauce like that anymore, okay, you know what I mean?

A Let's Go Joto or a you know how they did Gen 4 but had like chibi? You think it's going to be that? Strap in... oh God no, it's not worth it. Just that's what I'm saying, that's what I'm saying.

Yeah, yeah, cuz I think it's plausible. I think you're right as far as it could happen. I would hope that Nintendo would resist the urge; I would hope that Nintendo wouldn't even need to be free. I think I even get into what would I prefer right cuz like could it be free? Sure, yeah, just everything, but then you then get into the cost of what it takes to do that and like are they willing to do that?",

It's unlikely, but possible: Ocarina of Time remake exclusive for Switch to E3.

Like Zelda, I think, is that unicorn game of all right people like we have a Mario coming out this year most likely, right? We have a Mario, we have a Mario Kart, but like Zelda needs to be that thing on the horizon that people are like \"I've got to get myself a Switch to play that Zelda eventually.\" And my bigger thing here - the reason I added this was my last edition here because I've been wavering.

Alright, now here's a Stalone something something different but something very exciting, like as exciting as a mainline thing before we get to whatever our next reimagined Zelda thing is. Um, but a Time remake just sounds too good to be true to me; it sounds and and yes you're right, it almost reminds me of how you talked about Sonic Adventure and why Sega wouldn't want to make a Sonic Adventure 2; it's so lofty of the difference with those there are many differences with those, but uh the difference in terms of like possibility to me uh I I've said this many times but for people just listening to this episode of the show, the amount that Nintendo is investing in Breath of",

I think Nintendo is looking at those two styles as like things that they want to push as representing Zelda, mhm. Um, and Ocarina of Time, like you don't get bigger than that one, you know what I mean?

Then eventually on the Game Boy Advance, they put out a game called... uh, I don't even remember exactly, but Super Mario Advance... four. Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. A lot of... Mario Maker 3. Mario Paint 2. Jesus Christ, they're not actually going to call it that. They're not actually going to call it that. I'm just joking; I'm just joking. But what it is is Mario Maker 3, and the big thing is, what's it going to be different? Is it going to be Mario maker like we know, like we love, but there will be other game modes of things that you can make, and that will be Mario Paint-style stuff for those who don't know.

Yeah, many people played this game; many people loved this game. This game let you paint; it lets you make music; it lets you use Nintendo sound fonts to make Nintendo songs. A lot of there was a game called Nat Attack \u2013 it was awesome. A lot of the elements, both UI and sound effects, the saving robot, the loading robot, all that stuff were used in Mario Maker one and two. Mario Maker, in a lot of ways, is already a spiritual successor to Mario Paint. I think with mouse support adding more Mario Paint modes to a Mario Maker makes a lot of sense.
