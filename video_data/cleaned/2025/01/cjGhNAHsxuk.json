Right, there's got to be some weird Nintendo decision. So mine is, every first-party game that was available on Switch has had a 4K upgrade for $7, but it's available and for free as part of a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Oh wow, so they have it. You can buy it piecemeal or if you have Nintendo Switch Online, you get the 4K upgrade. It's only in first-party games, or maybe they have some third-party connections there, but they're going to just do that. I'm with you on that to some extent, but I don't think they offer it piecemeal. I think that they really just want to push Nintendo Switch.",
