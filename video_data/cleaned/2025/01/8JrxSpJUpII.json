It's been claimed that's according to the previously reliable podcast Nate the Hate, uh, which claims that the revealed trailer planned by Nintendo will focus on the Switch hardware with a software showcase coming later in February or early March. Quote, \"I can share with you that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be revealed in the coming week,\" I've been told the Switch 2 will be revealed on Thursday, January 16th, just a few days from now. They said, \"I've heard that the reveal itself is going to focus almost exclusively on the console itself. There's not going to be any presence of games.\" There could be a game shown running on the screen depending on how the trailer's put together but software.",

Um, but I I think that the dream's not dead anymore; I think OLED is a possibility so I'm excited for that, hopeful for that. So that would be something that I want to know, but like at this point, if the Switch 2 is revealed, you're asking them 48 hours of them saying something yeah, if just if it's just the like they dropped the trailer, I don't know that they do that necessarily. Um, they did put out the creepy Mario picture before they um to get people excited for the Switch one so they could.

Like the fact that they're talking about both of those - hell yeah, that'd be an incredible move for Nintendo and a great first year, make me very happy. But I do think that the big one is you match Skyrim with Elden Ring. While I don't personally care, I think it's going to be a big deal. It would be crazy. I just think that it's the way that Nintendo makes a statement of like, \"look what the Switch 2 is, y'all.\" You know what I mean? It's not just whatever; it's like, it also has the big games. Okay, it's a statement that I think is important right now. What do you think? What are you expecting or hoping for? Mario Metroid - right, I'm looking for some of the titles that wow me.
