Look at how good Starfield looks on this PC or laptop.\" It's like, what is the point of having an Xbox Series X when this looks that great? It could do all the things you're talking about. I think as long as things start to get more friendly with the Xbox Game Pass app and Steam, once those start to get integrated, we'll start to see a lot more integrations where it's not just on Steam Deck right now. I have to kind of do some roundabout ways to get the Xbox Game Pass app to work on my thing, it's not the end of the world but it's definitely not user-friendly and something I would recommend. It's the point to me, right?

I don't want to deal with it; I'd rather ask about getting a laptop to travel with to make sure I have a better experience than what the Steam Deck would be when so many of our review codes are not optimized for Steam Deck. That's where the Steam Link would kind of come into place or come into play, where the Razer Blade would work like a PC, where you could just open up the Game Pass PC app or you can open up Steam and you have all your games there, and it's a more powerful piece of hardware but a little bit less, I guess, streamlined. Right? That's my thing is like that's where I think an Xbox handheld comes in and gets really exciting to me because I own a Steam Deck just got a Razer Blade last week; I boot it up, it boots right into Windows, and I'm like, okay, I'm gonna have to watch some YouTube videos to figure out how to set up.

That is a changing thing, and yes, I stand down in that, I was incorrect, I was reading it a different way. I meant the fact that it evolves but I understand and yes to that respect, yes it evolves, yes it changes. You are correct. Uh, I had another one I wanted to get in here before we get to an ad break. Uh, here we go Street Shadow says uh, I see a lot of people say we want one console or PC only world but what uh, but what does that do to competition and how to generate new idea and how does that generate new ideas?

We are talking about the Rog versus the Steam Deck. Like I think even as we go to one platform, everything's PC, you'd still have people making different things and working on ecosystems and different operating systems to try to be the best place to play. Yeah, I think people are working with a narrow view of what competition is because it's not like Xbox is going anywhere at least for now right? Like I think Xbox still exists in that space as far as hardware right? Like you mentioned Steam Deck, R.O.G.

Um, but like you have all these different pieces of hardware. Nintendo's like you know doing their thing right, PlayStation doing their own thing. And I do think that the moves that Xbox is making, I think are going to leave PlayStation in a place and not just the Xbox thing right, but like I think PlayStation in general are in a in between a rock and a hard place. PlayStation can't be PlayStation forever in the way that they're operating currently because of the amount of money it takes to make games, because of how long it takes to make these games that are more demanding as far as fidelity scope all these things right, how much difficult it is to like how much more difficult it gets every generation to make a video game right, like that isn't going to stand.",

Now they are going to PC with older games. Clearly there's a pipeline. Clearly if when this would get to that point, they could flip a switch for lack of a better term and be like, \"Cool, yes, our exclusives are coming to PC day and date.\" But even then, it would be the thing of cool. Hopefully my Xbox thing that boots on the side can do it right, cuz that's what we're talking about.

Yeah, I'm really excited to see what the Next Generation sell is right; we were sold this generation on the most powerful hardware available, oh there's a second shift to get into more people's homes and what is this one? Is it just a handheld because we are Greg, I'm right on board with Xbox with the ecosystem in that cell of every screen can have your games all of your purchases but what what are you selling me next one?

And I'm excited to get really hands-on with this on this trip, it's awesome.

Bubby Kai super chatting says, \"Mike, picture the next Xbox as a beautiful spherical rectangular thing with a button press and chime in all its glory playing your Steam library and Xbox Library whispering in your ear, 'Your home, I love it.'
