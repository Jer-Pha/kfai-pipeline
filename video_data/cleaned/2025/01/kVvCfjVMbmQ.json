I was wondering why Nick Scarpino was wearing that shirt all day today, and I thought you were, I thought it was like an undershirt; I've just never seen him in the shirt but I like it, I think it's new, I do like it, but so here's the thing: the shirt looks good with the like shacket - what do you want to call it? There's an accessory missing. It was navy, which like accentuated the purple a little bit. Here we go; time it was it was a very Lapis... here's I mean here's here's here's just the real deal Holy Field though right is that Yam right there with Andy? What the **** is what is this new texture they've put on Nick, you know what I mean? Awkward. Did we just start a new season of the show?

I'm just kidding; we're not doing that. We are not doing that. Uh, but what we are doing is this: I want to make this very clear. We're going to stop reviewing TV shows in In Review. The reason is it was causing a lot of issues. It's very difficult to do the format of INR in review where we give the plot and uh all of that for weekly content; it's just not a great way to discuss these things. So, so we're going to be handling the TV shows in more of a screencast form. We'll still review them whenever we want to, but we're not going to be ranking them against all of the movies um and uh now that we have Screencast and In Review on the same podcast feed, it shouldn't really affect you if you uh subscribe.",

It's like that's a great question, and guess what, because of these discussions you're getting Creature Commandos next week. That's when we're going to do it, but it won't be in Review; it'll just be a screencast review discussion. So far am I being clear? Yes, and I'm happy we're making these changes. No, stop. Take that back for a second. I hate this. What I wanted to point out is that all three of us were against this throw of the bus. I'm kidding; we love it. We love everything so much. No, so we're trying to just be like we're trying to make the best content possible, and the TV stuff just wasn't working despite our many, many, many attempts.

It's all going to be dependent on a couple factors: one of those factors is, is it inherently sick for sure? Uh, second off, is it part of a fandom that we're already covering, things like Marvel or DC, Fast and Furious, things like that; on top of that, is there interest within Kinda Funny in actually spending our time watching these shows week to week; whatever it is, and is there interest from y'all? Are y'all watching the shows? Are y'all watching our reviews of the shows? Because there has to be a balance of us figuring it all out. So every show will be case by case.",

We're trying our best, and we're trying our best to make the best content for y'all. Does that make sense? And I saw you had your hand raised, Greg - yes, sorry, you might have covered it up. Yes, that all makes sense. Great job, I'm I'm very happy with this, thank you. But and I may have... I was really ready to get you with that none of none of us agreed on the joke, so I kind of blacked out everything you were saying. Did you talk about The Last of Us?

So when people complain in the movies, \"Man, quit making all these jokes,\" it's like, okay, but some of them are funny and good, so I don't mind them a whole lot. But here, with What If, just the comedic writing isn't quite there for the amount of stuff that they try to pull off, and um, I've had kind of bothered me since season 1. And but I would say that this season didn't feel like as much of a waste of time as the like season one or two did.

I like when we sit in some of the jokes a little bit more, um, but this has always been one of those weird serieses for me where you look at it and I'm like, \"I shouldn't like this.\" I don't particularly like how fast it is; I don't love how things are animated.

Season 2. Honestly I think all things considered this is the weakest of the villains that we've had. Can I pit you on why this villain is better than you think he is? Yes do you know the voice actor that voices this no okay it's Jason Isaacs who plays Draco Malfoy's dad in Harry Potter series does that sway you at all it does a little bit I liked his voice it's pretty good you know yeah yeah but I just think in terms of like overall taming kind of late and only two episodes, two episodes for the here I agree yeah but look I like that the other two villains came back and like were you know had their kind of redemption arcs to I mean actually full-on Redemption arcs yeah I mean Infinity that's that's haunting yeah and strange yeah strange good point all right I'm we're not ranking them",

All right, we're not ranking them; we're ranking the Eminence. Whoa, whoa, top of D tier would put him below number 42, Strange Supreme in What If Season 2. Who's the bottom of C tier and above The Vision from Solo? In Solo, Oh I like that personally, yeah, that works for me. Cool, there we go, there you go. The Eminence is entering at 43, everybody. Top of D tier. Thanks for playing; don't worry, there will be no RaguBaGu circumcisions when we redo this. They're all we figure out what we're doing with RBagu but we figured it out.

I would start the bidding putting it below Number 35, Falcon and Bucky, and above Uh Echo. So at 36 is where I would drop What If...? Season Three again. I see this is why the list is broken because What If...? #47 over there. But like, is that a heartbeat or see? I like I mean I just I I've always been higher on the show I think than you guys sure um so I would be more inclined to put this closer to Season Two, like I enjoyed this more than Werewolf by Night, I think but I don't like it more than Doctor Strange. I would put this at Number 51 under underneath Thor. Whoa oh you better rethink that. I don't like that get that out of here Tim where are you going to put this uh",
