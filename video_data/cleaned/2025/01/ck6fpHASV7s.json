I've left this as is since it's an ambiguous phrase.\n- No changes were made to \"Red Bull\" as it's a well-known brand.\n- Corrected \"kind of Le\" to \"kind of like\", assuming the hosts are making a joke about Joey mentioning something similar to what they're discussing.\n- No changes were made to \"God knows I can't she's running over God knows I don't know how to do God knows God only knows Godly knows uh God\" as it appears to be a humorous, fragmented phrase and not meant to be taken literally.",
