Um, that plus, I don't know, there's something thematically I didn't tweet about this, but it feels like, man, could have gone to therapy but instead I made a video game; what it feels like is out - you got to get that emotion out is right, but would I recommend it?

I think the conversation will steer towards, \"we got to get a 3D and a 2D.\" Oh, I think they might go Breath or Tears cuz Tears could be on here maybe they're saying you get one.

Spider-Man's very good, I think Spider-Man's on this list. I got nothing, I I got nothing to say are you.

Yeah which is funny because the design around this game is definitely heavily influenced by Link to the Past. Um yeah yeah see now you're going into bucket number two of alignment right because I could say League of Legends and Fortnite should be miles ahead of Batman: Arkham City. I think we all can make certain you know uh certain arguments for each game but like for Batman to be on the list, I think it's a thumbs up.

No, it's not above Pok\u00e9mon in no world, in no universe, in no timeline is it above Pok\u00e9mon. Um, but this is one of those ones too where I think like you got to put it somewhere. I think it should be lower; it should be lower. You know what? I'm not right now. I thought you had to have a sports game; I'm not mad at it. This is probably not the sports game I would pick, but when we talk about NBA 2K and what that is, uh, it's it is one of the more quality picks for a sports game, especially a sim sports game. It's a very quality pick, one of the more quality picks you can go for. And number 32, we got Pac-Man, Miss Pac-Man specifically. What's up with Miss Pac-Man versus The Original Pac-Man?
