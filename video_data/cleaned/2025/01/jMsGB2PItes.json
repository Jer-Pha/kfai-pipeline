Well, you know, you have to rely on your instinct. Right? In the...in the well of course, the game...what the team is trying to do and what's the foundation they are able to uh develop to build the game up and their experience of uh polishing and finishing the game in the past - and of course, the like a commercial kind of uh thinking: you know how much more money we have to spend and what's the revenue and profit we can bring in and compare that.

Right, Namco. So that's the nature of the business, so so you know of course we look at the commercial side of things but in the end you know you have to trust your gut. The biggest one I did was the PS3 generation, it was a huge cancellation, the biggest one I did was the \"The Last Guardian\" project, you know two projects after we spent $25 million so that was a huge cancellation at that time, but these days the size of the games is even bigger, so you know we see and hear about bigger cancellations, but you know $25 million, we've spent so many years on a team worked on do we stop",

So no one knows right there's no A and B comparison if we had continued these games we might have had another game of the year who knows right yeah so who was making the games you canceled, which was 25 million dollars - I didn't say but studios so that's another thing. So what I always said and thought about is a great team, talented team, brilliant people um and spending so many years in development, they worked on this project. They got crushing so in order to make it a little bit uh more um acceptable I always said that I don't want you people - great people to spend another three years on this rather I want you to start something totally fresh and new um so so that's the best",

They really aim high and the PlayStation hardware team is the same; they only think about the best hardware in the industry.

And they also allowed me to do the play test with users and find the difficult points in the game. Many people would have stopped playing.
