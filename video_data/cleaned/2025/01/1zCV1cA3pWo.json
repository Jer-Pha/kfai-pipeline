We can't believe it's been 10 years of Kinda Funny, and to celebrate we want to create the biggest year Kinda Funny has ever had while setting up another incredible decade.

We've been asking for your support and saying \"if you do this, we'll make that,\" but the truth is, we always want to do everything on the thermometer. So let's celebrate in 2024. We changed up the way we did podcasts, created a highlights channel, and made Gamescast a Daily Show. And guess what y'all supported us by showing up. That's what we're doing in 2025: doubling down on our core content and promising you an incredible year of Kinda Funny everything. You're about to hear we're doing no thermometer milestones needed.

We rolled with it, and I do like my little Mr. Chedda, and it was... the rendition of it was created by a real human artist, so I think it counts - I think it's legit.

We were pounding on it talking about how much this meant to us and how we were so excited to be here, and we had this conversation of like when we're both EIC's, editor-in-chief of Channels, cuz that's how it used to be run, like we should get this tattooed, and so I always had it in my head that I wanted to get the IGN logo tattooed on my arm right because this is the only place I think no offense to the Garfield tattoo I'm about to get on my calf - this is prime real estate.",
