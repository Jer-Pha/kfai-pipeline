We don't tell him; just let live and then we just see how big the iguana can get before Andy figures out that it's there. I say we put in like a 15-year-old iguana, one of them big boys, and a couple mice - one of the ones that just doesn't like people, slow walk around. Yeah, yeah, you think an iguana will freak people up? An iguana, yeah, yeah, and an iguana will check Andy at the door, and a large iguana would definitely check Andy; give him a tail whip right to it. My house now, my house. I knew a kid who had a pretty big iguana back in the day. I don't know why his family let him have that, but he had a pretty sizable iguana. Remember the 15 minutes you had a lizard?

Mike says he'd handle the pain well but wouldn't complain about it like Nick did for six months.

So much what I'll say is this: I think when you look on like when you Google what's the number one cause of kidney stones, I'm pretty sure Monster energy drinks are like probably top three; an Mtn Dew, whatever the **** **** is in there cannot be good for you; it cannot be. It's just stuff that your kidneys just straight up cannot be expected to process, not even try to process. Your kidneys shouldn't be expected to process that stuff. When I see Andy do a move like that, I think that's a kid who would have loved Four Loko. Oh yeah, like I feel like Andy was probably smashing Four Loko back in the day.
