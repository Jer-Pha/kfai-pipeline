I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the best voice in the business, Parris Lilly. Hello Paris, hello Greg, how you doing? I'm excellent, how are you? I'm I'm doing okay, I'm getting over being sick and I blame me being in the studio for getting sick. I've been sick since...and I want him getting a sinus infection. I appreciate that you blame the studio and not my sick son, the three-year-old that I had you around for dinner all night long 'cause that's why I'm sick, that's why my wife's sick, that's why my son is still sick. We have just that toddler; he just doesn't go away. Yeah, see over here, J best in the chat says or JT Besta. Greg has been six since 2023 and it feels like that at the house right now. It definitely feels like that. How are you? Are you okay? You okay? No, I'm okay, like I said, it turns out I got a sinus infection 'cause my wife has been mocking me for about a week going what is wrong with",

Like I said, it turns out I got a sinus infection cuz my wife has been mocking me for about a week going what is wrong with your eye because one of my eyes is like swollen, it's been all red and just a freaking mess. So got a bunch of antibiotics, I'll be all right. See that's interesting cuz this is the whole thing we talked about on the show throughout the last week - there was a whole does Ben have pink eye or does he not? And it was like I was like \"he clearly does not have pink eye\" and then other people were like \"no, he does\" and this would make more sense cuz it's it never developed into pink eye but sinuses would make sense cuz he still has the boogies just like everybody you know how it is. But that's a three-year-old for you - you thought you were out when does it stop?

Everything is more expensive. I don't like that one bit; I don't appreciate that one bit. But what I do like, Paris, is video games.

Paris, for me, this was among the first things that made me go \"oh ****\" when we did the preview CU. For me, I've talked so much about this - where I love Starfield, I enjoy Dragon Age: Inquisition, of the Veil Guard; love Dragon Age: Inquisition, but I felt like The Veil Guard is such a great job with the backgrounds. Okay, cool, I can do this kind of thing. Starfield, I took so long to find who I was to then roleplay that game - the idea of getting in here and immediately having it; I have a screenshot from my preview where I can tell you the Arcane Scholar background right, 'cause they call this... if you don't understand why you'd be picking this.",

And when it comes to encounters, our combat brings the best of the moment-to-moment fun that comes with action-oriented gameplay, and the depth and breadth of choice that you get with an RPG. Here to talk more about Avowed's combat is Gabriel Parra, gameplay director here at Obsidian. Our team's overarching goal is to empower you with choice, so we'll have a flexible combat system. That's what I want to hear. Empower you with choice. I again like this is what I want out of these kinds of RPGs. He's about to go into talking about combat and switching up the loadouts, which I think is so cool.

You're like, okay, I get it, and I didn't experiment; I didn't use the different things, and I didn't change my loadouts crazily. It was just like I'm fighting another mushroom dude or whatever. Like, I want to make sure there's varied enemies and varied enemy encounters, and it's not brain dead. Uh, Liz, that was the other thing: fighting so many goddamn lizards. Right? If they make every one of these encounters rewarding and fun to go through, they're going to be fine.
