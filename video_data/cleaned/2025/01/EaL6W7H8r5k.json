The Celeste dev's next game has been cancelled and Dragon Age: The Veilguard didn't meet sales expectations. We'll have all this in more because this is Kinda Funny Games Daily. What's up everybody? Welcome to Kinda Funny Games Daily for Thursday, January 23rd, 2025. I'm one of your hosts Greg Miller alongside Forbes 30 Under 30 aka the Okay Beast AKA Magic: The Gathering pop culture enthusiast Blessing Adeoye Jr. My favorite thing is that I'm pretty sure Kevin was trying to catch you off guard with the cold open. Yeah, cuz he he hit the 3-2 like out of like oh man like I'm I'm trying to help you with your hair I was like does my hair look fine you're like yeah you got one thing he's like three two Let's do let's go so I think he was trying to prove a point, but then he got himself forgot to press the there no no it's like all automated and for some reason the",

It's working now, see, see. Yeah, uh, how are we doing, Blessing? Uh, I'm doing well, I'm excited for the Xbox Developer_Direct. I don't have any I guess predictions because I know we already know the bulk of stuff they're going to talk about but there is that question mark on there that people are saying could be some kind of like GPG franchise, okay, like a legendary GPG franchise, yeah, they said something there right, yeah, yeah. And like who could what could that be? Who knows, but I'm excited to see what... Okay, are you excited? How are you feeling? Yeah, of course, it's Xbox Direct.

This is my negative part of the preview right where find it very hard to go from what we played and tell you anything other than it's Assassin's Creed, it was going and doing this thing and it was doing this thing and it's like you know when you're playing as uh Yas there sure are a lot of doors they want you to run through",

I didn't turn it on but it was an option, immersive mode this time around right where it's going to be all these native touches so when the people who speak Portuguese show up they're speaking Portuguese and then the rest would be in Japanese until somebody else speaks Spanish like they wouldn't dub anything it would be the people are speaking the way they should speak. Which I do think probably hits a bit more uh in certain situations again we won't say it but there's a moment with Yasuke early on where like hearing it all in English, it does get kind of like oh this is supposed to be a moment that I think like could have hit a bit more in uh actual like native languages and Japanese.",

Noel and I now want to take all of the lessons we've learned from Earthblade, wipe the slate clean, and refocus ourselves on back to a smaller scale projects. We're prototyping again and exploring at our own pace and trying to ReDiscover game development in a manner closer to how we approach it at Celeste's or Tower Falls Inception. Scaling the core team up post-Celeste has ultimately been a failure, and that's okay. We gave it all we've got, and life goes on. We are happy to return to our roots and reclaim some joy in our creative process and see where it takes us.
