This Mario Kart is going to actually have online functionality with our understanding of how people are playing games these days. So I feel like more players and more focus on online multiplayer is definitely going to be a thing with this, and I think that will differentiate it from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe so far. Seeing this excites me; I think there's a lot of potential here for cool stuff. If you want to, I hope so, man. I just pulled from a communication error. I'm going to be real \u2013 depressed, loose guy. Uh, side by side with uh Mario, Mario cting it up. See see how puffy these goddamn cheeks are. See how they've revamped him if they've revamped him at all.

You have like a pit crew, way too serious as we just you know go with all the breadcrumbs we have here. If you can leave right here, Barrett, one of the things I just saw, of course, former IGN DS writer, handheld writer Craig Harris was on Blue Sky wondering if the fact that some of the Switch is exposed in the dock this time around if that could be used for notifications, if it be used for rather than just putting it nobody you know not nobody, I'm sorry, but people who dock it always always like it kind of set throws off the entertainment center cuz it's ugly.

What's up with Peach back there being on the motorcycle okay what's up what are you doing no it's I'm just trying to see any character model that is different I don't know I'm just surprised that he's the only one also I do I I believe I see an item pick up uh in that under Yoshi's little Burger Joint here um cuz that was an exciting thing as well of like maybe no items that'd be crazy, Yoshi's Burger Shop is shaped like Yoshi's head that oh yeah so cute Pro them I that me",

I mean there is a lot of characters in C8 Deluxe by the end of it all cuz they kept adding those, true yeah like not that there's like not more than 24 characters but I think if you're going to have that many people on in play like you're you're going to want to expand that anyway could you pick",
