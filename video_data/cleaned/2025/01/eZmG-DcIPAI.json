I thought a lot about how we can continue the story without just giving the audience the same experience that they got when they were playing. The movie has sort of the same tone and the same vibe but it expands upon the universe. I'm very proud to be part of this evolution onto a screen. One of the creative things the game did is that people make different choices and die in different ways. The movie has this mechanic where things start over and then they get to try again, what just happened every time they come back to life it's like they're in a new horror genre to survive they have to make it until dawn.
