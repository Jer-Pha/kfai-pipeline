We were sitting around outside IGN being like, \"When can we quit? Maybe a year or a year and a half,\" and then we quit six months later after that conversation. Then we're like, \"Well, maybe we'll be able to hire someone one day.\" Nine months later, we hired Kevin two weeks ago. There it is; that's Kevin. Everybody as much **** as you guys give me, I lived a **** dream. I've known Tim my entire life; I've never seen him quite this happy in this particular way, and it makes me so happy. This is Gia; this is Mom. Now that you're introduced, this is my girlfriend. So last week we did this crazy thing called Kinda Funny Live. Oh, I remember this, and it was a goddamn good time. It was fun. We knew going in it was going to be more than what people were expecting it to be, and now I'm like, \"I really do wonder what we\"",
