Um, and people can decide if they want to read that book and if so, much like with Kickstarter, you can back it and say yeah, okay, with InShare, it's a little simpler, you just decide I will order this book and I I'm a little bit cheap, I'll get an e-book that's fine or maybe I'll buy a hardcover version or maybe I want to.",

The whole production of the film has moved over to Pinewood now, and you know, I handed off my work and said, \"You know, I wish you the best of luck.\" I worked on it for about a year, and by the end of the process, I was just completely exhausted. It was by far the most rewarding creative thing that I ever did; like the entire time I was working on it, the 12-year-old version of me is going to say, \"Dude,\" um, but it was also completely an utterly exhausting because I was so... when it was announced, I got two types of messages on Twitter: one was congratulations, and the other one was, \"Don't **** this up.\" And that of course, oh yeah, thanks for pointing that out.",

I was just there as a courtesy - the directors invited me to go to the set because they knew I'd be excited to see it.

And how do we make it unique to us? And how do we use like the unique opportunities that you have for the player to actually be part of the story and influence it themselves.

Look at the tone of the original Star Wars which is really um it's just fun it's like camping places just like it's it's a save the princess story it's a save the princess you know the farm boy saves the universe and it's ends on like a tremendous triumphant note they all get their medals apart from Chewbacca uh and everyone they don't.",
