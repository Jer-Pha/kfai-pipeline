They'll take points off, and rightly so, because the standard has been set by Naughty Dog and Telltale and BioWare doing these games well. You can tell good stories, and now you miss it when it's not in another game. Um, so I've done a bunch of that work. I worked as a story consultant on season one of The Walking Dead for Telltale. You have a BA for that, don't you? Yeah, we want a BA. I mean, I don't get to keep it in my house; it's like Telltale's off the charts. We want a BAA for best story and um a bunch of story awards.

How do we use the unique opportunities you have for the player to be part of the story and influence it themselves? That's obviously what The Walking Dead is, essentially an interactive TV series where you get to play main character and decide where the story goes. People love that - people love the power of making moral choices and having that kind of power over the story. It's really something people are really into.

Lee and Clementine would do this and blah blah blah it's really exciting. And then they'd sit and go, \"what is there for the player to do during\" - oh **** well not very much okay. Well like, the player can watch Pitch that scene again but in a way that the player gets to influence what happens. And why is it interesting for someone not just watching but actually playing the role of the lead character? Right so it's really really hard to do that.
