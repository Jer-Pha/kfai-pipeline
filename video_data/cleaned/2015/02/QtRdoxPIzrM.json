I love to go \"I b\" since I'm way better than everyone else here at this F Tim. Why you all up on me, bro? You are Greg and I basically just been fighting each other. It's kind of funny that Kinda Funny game. Jesus, oh Greg coming in like a little Touched by an Angel kid. Yep, that's exactly what I came in like. Know what the heck that means? It's exactly what I was thinking, which is funny that you said that. Oh, where am I... oh my God, this character. Ah, it's too quick. I don't like him. I got aggressive there. God damn it. Oo, nope. Dam you, a-hole. Oh, ****, oh my little Whirlwind saved you there didn't it? Yeah, Little Pony. Ooh, Nick, you got nasty. Oh God, I'm playing bad guys. I was doing a thing, guys. I was doing my move. No, I missed. Nope. One Life to Live. Oh my God, this is too much. I don't know what's happening. God damn it. H, oh I got one.",

I don't know what's happening. God damn it. Oh, h. I got one more life. Nick has one more life, so what's everything at Link? He's not bad actually, too fast. He just doesn't use half of his moves. Yeah, I don't like... I like... I don't like characters that move this quick; they don't have heft. He's no D for sure. Woo, everybody tumbling off the side together. Call Morard trying to be the true Link, the true Link, green hero of time. God damn Moon nights. Oh, I almost got him. Oh, oh no, no. Okay, it is okay. Still the champ, yeah. I'll let them fight out their little battles. My pre-match prediction of Nick Scarpino seems to be looking quite... I don't know. This character is rough; it takes a little getting used to. He's pretty easy; he's pretty dope. He's pretty easy. Okay, think I might need... I know I well... I got eliminated like 20% with you cuz I got a lot of whack and fell off the",

I get you this isn't looking good for me, Greg - you're just down one, it's not looking that bad actually. I mean Nick's looking really good, Nick's looking like a fine-tuned automobile racing down the Sierra Nevada strip. Sierra Nevada strip, yep, heard of that, seeing the coast, looking at the Atlantic Ocean, smelling the breeze off Florida mix little chip damage getting you there too. My goal is to interrupt him and everything he does. You're doing really good. Oh damn, why are you picking on me? Why don't you have Nick because there's strategy here. I need to be the final two. Oh Nick, way out there coming back. Nick still has three lives looking pretty goddamn good. Oooh ooh ooh ooh, you're out, be a new Champion. Oh damn, you look so mad every time you lose a life.

That's all that matters. But can't you take Nick down here? I don't know; no, definitely not Nick. He has three lives - how did you hold on this long with three lives? Uh, Tim, it was a strategy of fighting only Colin worked in my advantage. Colin, how are you feeling after... Oh, fine! I don't like playing as Link; he's a little too simplistic for me. He's fast, and he has like eight thousand moves - it feels like. Don't really like him; he's too simple. Nothing has any heft that he does. Yeah, that slash, that strike he has is pretty far...

My pred up well, I hope the retention rate on the video is good right there. Nick says it's boring and he's gone. I want to go back to my guy before I... all right, before you put him out to pass. All right, you ready to dance? Only I'm ready to dance hard. I Don't Dance Tim, I dance hard. All right, good. It's the only way to dance. Is that supposed to... oh, you're already going for the power moves. Oh, it's working out for you. Damn, you guys are rolling around like two ferrets. Things aren't looking good.
