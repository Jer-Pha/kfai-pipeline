I've never met someone who's creative or hard-working, but if I had no money at all, the last thing he would want is for us to be sad. So I want to take a look at some of the amazing things he has poured his passion into. For me, it all started when he broke into the internet with \"Dead Fantasy.\" I remember being shocked that was even possible for it to exist; the animation was so fluid, the choreography was so creative, and just seeing two of my favorite characters fight without the restrictions of developers made sure that I posted on all of my friends' MySpace pages. And to have it all end in a K-pop dance-off \u2013 this guy just gets me! And to imagine that he made the entire video by himself was awe-inspiring, especially at a time when I was just getting started in Internet video. And then \"Dead Fantasy\" parts 1 & 2 dropped; it felt",

To see him at RTX or PAX or Comic-Con and to see the reaction you could get from thousands of cheering fans, I will always feel overwhelming pride for him and how far he pushed his dream. I will never forget the day I first met him and got to tell him how influential he was to me; we ended up talking for hours about how you would listen to a song on repeat for months, piecing together fights synced to the beat in his head, and how he had this crazy idea for someone to fight with nunchucks made of shotguns that Woodcock as they swing around \u2013 it. He just couldn't get it to work; now of course knowing Monty, months later I saw you manage just fine, Zamani. I just want to say thank you, thank you for the years of entertainment, for inspiring me to do what I do, and for being such a good",
