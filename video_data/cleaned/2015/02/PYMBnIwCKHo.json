Yeah, these guys are just hang around there's like no PL. I mean this is this is a tough stage it's weird like what are those Mon. I don't know, I don't Mony faces. I don't know what that is. You think that's Andros? It could be. I don't really know. I don't know what the hell that is. I'm looking at it really closely for the first time.

These will be the Metal Blades and you remember you can shoot these in different directions so it might help you to shoot them up in diagonal here there and then jump and then this guy's going to come yeah so shoot up and then he's yeah exactly perfect that's exactly right and then one more perfect perfect perfect I like how you know exactly how",

Yeah, I love how so now you're going to deal with these guys again. You might want to switch back to your um, to your peashooter, so go up to next press start, and then P perfect. And he's so now it's getting a little it's getting a little hairy but once you get through this Gauntlet, you're basically home free. But now instead of having Platforms in between him, you're actually going be jumping from guy to guy, so you need to you need to actually get to the right where where am I even going? You have to spawn him, so get to the right um once that horn disappears just see yeah and then he's there. Then you have someone to deal with.

That was scary all right, middle blade okay now you got the extra life. So I don't think this is your last life. I think you have one more after this. So I think you're okay and Air Man's not hard. So I think you'll be all right. Are the birds here? Uh they'll be here soon jump one more time kill the guy with the fan, and then when you go past him the birds will start spawning. The metal blade is just so heinously overpowered it's like not it's like not only because it's powerful but because it doesn't use any yeah like I don't know what the hell they do with this weapon and a little known tip and we'll learn about it in Wily's Castle is that um Metal Man's",

Oh God, there so yeah go he dropped the egg into the nice oh God you were close you were close you were really close what oh that's it all right I thought you had one more life. Oh I did two all right. So let me beat the Wily stage and we'll get through it. You were doing you were doing you deserve I could have had that. I guess we have to I guess we have to we got to get this in the in the butt let's get this in the can so I don't like this stage either.

But was that just like a one-hit kill thing? Yeah, it was cuz I damaged him, I would have had to hit him twice with it if I didn't damage him. So you try to use the Peashooter to try to like jump in between the tornadoes and block your shots so you have to try to get in between tornadoes and hammer him a few times. He'll do that three times, he'll jump to the other side of the stage and he'll keep doing that over and over again. Um but the reason we wanted to go here first before we went to Heatman is because we need item two, item two is basically the Rush Jet and it's essential for Heatman stage um so we'll uh I think",
