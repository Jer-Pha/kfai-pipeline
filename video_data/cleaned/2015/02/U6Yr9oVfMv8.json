We're talking PS4, PS3, PS2, PS1, PSP, and PS Vita. Wow, okay, that's a lot to list. It is. I don't know anything about any of these consoles. We faked it for 381 episodes - the wrong guys to have on the show. We should just get Nick. It should just be me and Nick. Jesus, I'm wearing the wrong shirt today. Yeah, I know right? Your PlayStation exclusive episode you're in. He wear your Xbox exclusive shirt. It is what it is, I guess. But what we're going to do here is we're going to go from current gen all the way back.

Let's do it. What's the best PlayStation 4 game? We're starting with the best PS4 game now. For what? What I'm going to do for these is I have a list. I did a little research. You like lists? You, you, you're making... You have a list! List the list! It's what I do. Check the list. So what I've been doing is I spent the day kind of doing a little Google research checking out sounds like a hard day other people's top lists for for each of the consoles and I just kind of made notes. Now, the criteria here for these best games is these games need to be either exclusive to the console okay or known for being on that console. An example is Grand Theft Auto III which is not exclusive to the PS2 but everybody so you would include like a Final Fantasy series in there that's exactly we yeah we were talking about that, yeah, VII was the game that came out and then",

Yeah, you stole my... You stole my answer for what the best PlayStation cop-out **** answer. You know, you're a cop-out **** guy, and I've been waiting eight years to tell you, and here I am on the Kinda Funny Gamescast. There are so many there's so many great games on PS4 that's not one of the games you should pick DC Universe Online then. So the games that I have on this list - let me know if you want to add more - we got Metro Redux, get the what Killzone: Shadowfall. I thought we just said you couldn't upres and do stuff re-releases so Metro Redux is tough because this is... This is your problem already gun, because Metro well it's there's it's a",

This isn't usually how we used to do lists. No, I, I agree but Tim's got a new world. I'm upset down. I'm swimming on this in this world. I actually think that it under this criteria to me you've named three of the best games on the console under the exclusive or known for being on the console only kind of thing and that would be I think Resi 7 is clearly number one and then I think You put Infamous in Killzone, you're not putting Transistor in there. I have not played enough Transistor to say anything about it. And again, Transistors are also on PC and will also eventually come to Xbox One so again it's known for being I mean like I think if we're going to",

I'm like I don't know how I feel about that, that's a right there's why it's not in the running, that's why it's the game. But I think that I think Resogun is obviously and I know people get some people get mad at me for this but it's like such a **** good game you know what I mean. And and then I actually think Infamous: Killzone Shadowfall might be with the exception of Mercenary maybe the best Killzone game, right? Some people really some people like Killzone 2, some people really down on Killzone Shadowfall. I I gave it an eight when I was at I stand by that score completely.

For me, Transistor I would pick you know 10 times out of 10 to play over Resogun just because I enjoy story like I play games for stories and experiences get lost in it, you know what I mean? Like I don't... But then do you think it's weird to say Transistor is the best PlayStation 4 game? It's a very interesting thing to say, it's something I hadn't thought about, you know what I mean? I really really hadn't thought about it in this way in so long right because it is still in the infancy of PlayStation 4 so it's not one of those things where I've had to really go out and say it's more.

I just well I really don't think you know I wrote a piece at IGN because I still write you know once a week over there and I wrote a piece about Dying Light and the whole argument was you know today right before we recorded MPD came out and Dying Light was the best selling game in the United States in January, not really a huge surprise, um, and what I wrote about was is that the context is important with Dying Light, Dying Light would have always been a great game, yeah, but it was when it came out that made it stand out, but even if it came out in October when it sold it would",

It still would have been a great game, so I think it would be unfair for me to say that Killzone: Shadow Fall - I gave an eight, and I really do think it's a great game, and then it's just not going to be a great game one day like for the place in time it was a great game. And I think that um they opened up Killzone again, and I'd like to see Guerrilla walk away from Killzone; there're not going to but they wanted to you know like we've said before many times on Beyond - Sony's desperate for Killzone to be a thing, yeah, you know they've been they've been it they've been desperate since 2004, 2005 for Killzone to be a thing.

Why wouldn't it be a PS2 game? There's new V, I mean because it's not a straight port there. It's they went through and redid it into widescreen. They went through and redid the graphics. No again, my waving hands. Yeah... I think that it counts because and we talked about this on uh last week's or this week's actually Kinda Funny Gamescast episode with Persona where I think that it being on the Vita kind of gave it to a whole new audience and like that was their first experience with the game so I I feel like it counts for that reason just because like people are going to forever think of Persona 4 as being a Vita game because that was their first experience they didn't play it on PS2 at least for a lot of people.

It's the same way I felt that way about Dead Nation um on Vita was just that the nubs are too small, the screen's too small. It's a great idea to have something like Dead Nation on the go, but not an execution. And I feel like it was the same way with Rogue gun. So I think this is a pretty solid list of games. The other games I'm thinking of, like Rogue Legacy or something, are not they're known for being PC games, so it's not really ported late. Hotline Miami story and I say Hotline Miami is best on Vita. Agree, I agree with you that game's made for analog 6. The reason I couldn't play and didn't understand how to play Hotline Miami is cuz I just don't know how to Playard and I don't.",

I can't wait for the second one, oh my God, I do soon, it's got to be soon, yeah. Um, so yeah, I think that's where we stand with Vita.

But what was cool is that it had this really slow burn: PSP games still come out, like every few months there's a new PSP game on Universal Media Disc. What I look at is the beginning - I think about Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories, those 2005-2007 kind of era games that stick out to me.

I think it had a lot of standout cool titles that stood on their own. Standout cool titles that stand on their own, damn. The Patapon series was awesome. Local Roco people loved Hot Shots Open Te, which granted don't get me wrong, Hot Shots has been around, but it felt at home. Lumines came and kept coming, yep. Uh, Metal Gear Solid.

And uh, now that it's on the HD Collection, I started it and I was like, \"This is cool,\" and I like the comic cutscenes, I like all that stuff. But I never felt the need to keep playing.
