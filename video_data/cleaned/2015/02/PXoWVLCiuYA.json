Like The Simpsons are still their old-school looks like Bart with the blue shirt as opposed to his orange shirt. Was that a big Switcheroo? I thought it just happened occasionally that he just wears a different outfit. No, I died wasn't just like season one. I don't know; I'm not a Simpsons official andado, but I just hate that I'm looking at this like earlier there was a cut scene you see it, and there was like a Homer who looked all different. Definitely, it's definitely still made when The Simpsons just started to explode. There's Bartman, yeah, you don't see a lot of bartmans anymore. I had a Bartman shirt, but it was like an off-brand shirt; it was a yeah, I remember when he flashed through Fox Chicago WFLD 32 when The Simpsons were brand new.

We still made it though; we made it to Crusty Land. That's really all that matters. Is that really it? I don't think I ever made it to Crusty Land. Extinguished. Well, did you have 37 credits before the prerequisite $4 and quarters at least? That's the beauty of these games - they're so short too; they're made for the arcade. Yeah, God, how much money they made off these back in the... Oh my God, I can't even imagine how they and how do they even report that revenue? I don't know. It's funny that you think that way though. Think about this: like I'm gonna beat the show. This oh my God, I just puked and just can't tell where I'm hitting. Tim, get off me, bro.

I remember the Ninja Turtles game was the same way, but it's like just being able to fight back Shredder and all that stuff was cool. Sure, sure, sure, and also being able to play with four people was kind of cool, yeah. And having 36 credits was dope. Nope, that would make too much sense for a video. Oh my God, I just jacked that dude up! You're getting jacked up, bro! Oh no, snowball too! Sharing Terry, thank you. I'm not crazy, right? There's just one attack that's all you can do... This game is so... you jump an attack, jump! I need that. You jump attack. I used to do that when it was Cyclops. Well, that's a true story. Did you know the X-Men are mutants? I did not know that.

This game is over 20 years old. I'm just saying there needs to be an eye for Quality, ladies and gentlemen. That's another let's play here on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames each and every day we bring you a new let's play. Today's was Multiplayer Monday - we all played this cooperatively.

Do you watch The Simpsons as a show? Was it ever funny? Did you enjoy this game? Did you enjoy it when it was re-released? Let us know in the comments then make sure you share this.",
