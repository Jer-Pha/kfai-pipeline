The that that light Bumble and bumble hairspray it actually goes away after a while. I can run my hand through my hair; I don't feel like it's a hair helmet, and then it gets kind of a little bit more volume in it not not right now but throughout the day as you kind of keep rubbing your hand through your hair that all that stuff kind of stays and gets a little more volume to it.

It's supposed to actually physically regrow the hair, so I'm just fascinated about trying it for a couple months. If I get anything, if I don't get anything, I'm not going to waste the money on it.

Get some hard data about our Patreon supporters specifically, which I think you could kind of sprinkle out in some respect, maybe not scientifically, but to the audience as a whole. Maybe in terms of age, um, for instance, or this significant gender gap that we have, um, and uh, and I think that that might just exist generally in spaces like this unfortunately.
