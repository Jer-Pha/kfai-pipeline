Last time we're gonna see this; they're not gonna make another one for a really long time, if ever. Thank God. Good job, JK. Um, is she writing another book? She has written another book - it was a prequel. In there, making another movie, it's a prequel. It is the policy to do it in three parts, right? It's only a tiny book. Right. I'm pretty sure.

But I don't know they were gonna call the first one Enter the Night right how dope is that and then the second one Dawn of Justice holy crap I don't need to know anything else, I would buy tix. Why do you see okay is it gonna be like five years we're basically movies are just ate our TV shows Jude I'm sayin like that's I'm okay with the hard was kind of dealing with that though is the how long it takes in between the gyms and that's why this was cool to me is that six months apart you'd be",

So why I think it's only a couple years difference for everything just change you to that model and everything yeah I love that he's kicking the crap out of movies right now it's true that's the whole thing and that's why I like I was getting this argument that the best live-action interpretation of Superman in my lifetime is Smallville, now granted tons of bad Smallville episodes got so many of them entire seasons that were just trashed but the good ones were so great instead of such an awesome storyline and lineage and like you know I feel like I know that version of Clark where is",

What's so it's like, like it takes so much effort to make like so many cooks in a two-hour movie like that script gets just like worked over like bad dough. And then if you have to do 22 hours, it's too fast to actually get an equality. That's why the eighth and tenth episodes are like the golden Spock \u2013 you can actually do them well. Are you sleeping? Well, I smelled something. You smelled sleeping. What look to soften someone call the hospital, she's having a stroke, Mrs. I smell toast. Yeah, I actually smell something too.

The \"red\" is likely referring to the 2016 film \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\", which was a commercial disappointment. So, they probably would have considered splitting it into two movies for better box office performance. Movie sales are down twenty-five percent over the last decade, and movies are more expensive than ever to make, so there's just a lot of weird financial reasons at play that they want to put the movies up and really few reasons it seems that would have anything to do with the subject matter being true to the subject matter. The \"hot oil\" is a great example - right, The Hobbit was shorter than The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, but Two Towers got a three-hour movie out of nine hours of material. You know, that was obviously a final decision if those movies were made today they'd be like 25 or five-part movies each. I mean, um, the funny thing is, what these super early movies are really just trying to see how Batman vs Superman does. The last thing no one wants is a bad Superman movie - there hasn't been a good Superman movie in a long time, and I'm not sure we've talked about science fiction recently",

Going to happen like you keep pushing out these movies, two or three parts, like you announce your movie slate for 20-21, it's insane, you're making it insane. Like I've never seen anything like it, you know. Like this show can't last forever, it's gonna be like a hard bubble burst. But there is that we are sort of going away from the traditional movies which sucks to say because I love movies above all. But like going back to your point, I like what the BBC does right when they put out in like Sherlock, 3 episodes and a half hour each, they feel like their own movie but there are TV shows and there you really can't put them in a category that we use or metric that we use to",

Yes, so it starts off in Austin, Texas; no, it starts off with me as a kid, like a very small kid who also did strange, weird kid lots of weird stories. I spent a year writing this thing, so uh talking about yourself for a year - it's like I'm over you, but hopefully other people know me um a lot. A lot is about how I started making The Guild, about the internet, about how I grew up on games, starting a company; like it really just uh it's all the things that kind of make me weird and hopefully encourage other people who are weird to just embrace who they are. I mean that's court the kind of core what it is, and I'm really excited for it - it's gonna be out in August, so I'm gonna be doing book tours, so obviously traveling quite a bit, and yeah you know it's I don't know if you guys",

And a lot of my struggle over the years was just figuring out how how to actually put myself out there or not feel like I'm just at this weirdo. Um, so yeah, that's the core of it, and I'm you know I'm excited to to get it out there. It's it's something I've been working on so long, it's like I can't wait. Can I ask because I always thought if and I know attempts but I think the same thing: If you were to write your own autobiography, would you embellish, and to what degree?

But oh okay, I tell it enough people will think it's true, and actually, I'll think it's true too. So were you? That's my question. The real question was how when you were recalling these stories, it was hard to be blatantly honest with yourself and hard to retell them without yeah, exposing yourself. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I write a lot; I mean, I wrote The Guild and other screenplays and things like that, but I'm never really sure when you're talking about yourself, you have to sort of zoom out and be like, \"Who am I?\" And how is this useful to other people without just",
