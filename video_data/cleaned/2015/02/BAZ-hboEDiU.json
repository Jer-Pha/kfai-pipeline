So I say, \"I'm an internet personality,\" and she goes, \"Oh, okay.\" And then so what? What does that look like in five years? Ouch. And I was like, \"What? You're like why would you start with that?\" No, we had been talking; we had been talking. Get a car. What do you do? What the... are you going to be in five years? What are you doing?

Joe role did you think when you were doing that that that was now life and that's what you're going to do no I at at that time as I said earlier I I came out the ostensible reason I came out was to be a singer and actor I was a singer first who became an actor a lot of stage work so I presumed that I would do you know I just like to work man and I still have and you know what it's about passion I love to work I've been rich and I've been poor and rich is better but I don't make money unless I'm passionate about",

I've tried putting the money first; it doesn't happen. But anyway, I just wanted to work. I never really thought that it would be my total ball of wax career-wise until I started really working with all these great actors who were not limited by their sort of visys parents, yeah. And I thought, man, this is cool. You can not only do great stuff, but then when I started to get a chance to sing in all these shows, that's when it really started to take off because I... a lot of folks you know, you come to find out a lot of folks can do character voices or dialects, but they can't always sing in the character voices of their dialects. And that really is the most fun for me doing this Animaniacs live stuff; it is an incredible labor of love.",

But all you can ask for as far as I'm concerned is the opportunity and be ready. And I'm like you; I didn't know anybody. I came from Flint, right? And but it was like, well, I'm not going to do it here, and I got to go do my thing and figure it out. Got to try and keep... and then at least if you decide some things, my brother's a great example of that. My brother is now in the financial industry in New York, and he was an actor for years. He'd had enough; he said, \"You know what? I was there, and I did that. I'm ready to just sort of do what I mean.\" I went back to school, got the NYU blah blah blah.

I know it's not like we have the same talent or the same gifts. I totally get that. But as far as I'm concerned, there are like three levels of passion. You know? If you're lucky, you find something about which you're passionate right away. If you're luckier, you find that you are good at that which you are passionate about.
