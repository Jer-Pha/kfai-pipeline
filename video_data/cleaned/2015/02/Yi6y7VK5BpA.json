Yet another reason why I'm glad I was an early subscriber to Netflix. Oh yeah, yeah. This is huge news, man. And you know, I'll be honest: like when I first heard this, like Netflix is a perfect platform for this. They're going to do what they always do, hopefully fingers crossed, which is they're going to buy an entire season. Which will be nice in terms of the budget; it won't be 24 episodes; it'll probably more like 12 episodes. Uh, and you're going to be able to watch it all at once just like you would be able to play the game all at once at your leisure. You take in the content as you want to take it in. No no more commercial breaks; none of that stuff. I'm excited about this. So where this stands right now, this is from a report from The New York Times and Wall Street Journal. Yes, and so they just announced this thing that",

R. Martin there was no other kind of barriers or gatekeepers for that Nintendo has kind of historically been um a little harder to work with on that side kind of a dick well on his own series he is man um but they're very very protective of their IP and rightfully so because their core content",
