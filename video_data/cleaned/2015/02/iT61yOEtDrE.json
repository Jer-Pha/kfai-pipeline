Tell me a little bit about how you believed it when you heard it. No, this is one of those things; this is huge news. Like every once in a while, you get the news that breaks and makes you go, \"Uh-oh, what are we going to do?\" We're the type of people who need to react to these things exactly. So, you know when Star Wars news broke that 7 and 8 were coming? That was like, \"Wait, there's no way that's real, right?\" And this is one of those things where there were rumors about this for so long - the Sony hacks and all that stuff. So we're all like, \"This is what we want,\" but will they be able to make it happen? Last night I saw a tweet come out, and I'm like, \"I don't trust this guy; this person tweeting this.\" I don't trust him. Then I clicked on it, then I saw Marvel.com, and I'm like, \"Is that an L or is\"",

No, this is legit, and I lost my ****. I found out about it from your tweet about it, but your tweet almost looked like you had been hacked, so I didn't believe it either till I clicked through and went through, and then I was like, \"Oh ****, all caps, OMG.\" Yeah, exactly. That's me, Greg. You should know better. Well, I know, but I'm just saying something about a dinner ring. We've been burned before. Uh, of course, the deal here is that Spider-Man will first appear they say in one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies; they don't say which one, but we have a good idea of when or which one it will be because then he gets his own standalone on July 28th, 2017. Now if you click over then and you look at when these movies are coming out right what we",

Now if you click over then and you look at when these movies are coming out right what we have on the slate already - the next it seems like it's got to be Captain America: Civil War, which makes sense where Spider-Man has such a big deal in the Civil War storyline exactly. And so this is just a partnership between Sony and Marvel; it's not him, Marvel's not making this movie, so Sony's still funding it and all that stuff. But uh we got our boy Kevin Feige - we already went through this whole thing, Fagi, Figy... let us know in the comments when he comes on the Game Over Show then we'll know how to say his name exactly; he's the guy overseeing the whole MCU and so he's going to be helping to make sure that Spider-Man fits into that - and that's all I ever thought that's really it.",

The movie there's going to be an Ant-Man movie, there's going to be a Venom movie; nobody knows what the hell is going on but that's the thing. So Amazing Spider-Man one I liked it a lot. Amazing Spider-Man 2 the internet hates, critics really didn't like; I enjoyed it. I saw the first half on a plane; I thought it was fun. It was fun way too much crammed into it and there was Electro was a piece of **** things are bad but what really fell off the rails is they were like oh Sony needs to build its own franchise like X-Men did so now it turned into this whole problem and Sinister Six was one of those things so now we're at this point where it's like all right we're going",

Um, what we don't know is what's happening in Sinister Six - it's not canceled yet, yeah, but so we'll see, but uh, I mean it could still happen just down the line as part of this which that could be awesome, yeah, um, but then the other big question is, is Andrew Garfield going to be in? Everybody said it looks like no, they said coming out of this stuff that he wouldn't do and then even last night, Vulture was saying probably not going to be him, it probably won't happen. What are your thoughts on that, cuz it upsets me. It's upsetting, yeah, because here's the problem with it is the fact that if you get rid of Andrew Garfield right then you have to start all over and if you're going to use Spider-Man in a Civil War storyline",

Well, there's a big issue already with the Civil War in the movie universe - in that all the movie characters so far we know their secret identities. There's not a secret; they're known that no one knows who Hulk is, but most of them... like the majority of them, everyone knows Tony Stark, everyone knows Captain America. These aren't like secrets; they're just identities that they have. Sure. Um, so to build that up already has that issue. So I think an easy way to get around all of this is just have some J Jonah Jameson goodness on news stories, Daily Bugle stuff going on in the background of Civil War. Okay, and uh, just kind of explain that like... oh, the mass Menace blah blah blah... and they kind of build up the fact that like saying don't even show Spider-Man in Civil War, but oh no, have",

If it was Donald Glover for sure should play him; of course, a little old, but whatever. No, he's old. Andrew Garfield, yeah, but he means he plays young. But Miles Morales is supposed to be younger than Parker. You are correct; yes, that is the other problem. M.Mor is supposed to be 8 years old, and that's an issue I have with him in the comics too, where it's just like you're not doing 8-year-old things; like you're acting like a grown-ass man, and it's just like you're only doing this when it's like convenient for the weird storylines and stuff. Otherwise, they're just treating him like a normal dude, he's going on dates, and all this stuff; it's like you're not 8-year-old Miles Morales. Yeah, um, but I don't think that the movies are ready for Miles Morales yet, like I",
