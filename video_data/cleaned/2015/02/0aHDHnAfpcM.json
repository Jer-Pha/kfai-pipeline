            "text": "Greetings and salutations. My name is Colin Moriarty. This is the illustrious Nick Scarpino. Hello. We are back here for a Teaching Tuesday right here on Kinda Funny Games. Nick, we've been trying to blaze our way through Mega Man 2, one of those great NES games from back in the day, and we've been beating it stage by stage by stage. No, I don't have a good memory, but I'm trying to figure out which, why would they design characters that are just all... That's because you beat me seven, this particular gentleman here. Okay, I see. So we started with I think we beat Bubble Man, Flash Man, and Metal Man early on. Then we went through guys like Wood Man, Quick Man, then Crash Man. And Tim and I just went through Air Man, and now we are going to go through Heat Man. You only have one option left, Heat Man. Who is the robotic Zippo lighter. So go ahead and select him. So real quick before we get into that. Wood Man was my favorite. Heat Man is",

            "text": "coming up on my favorite though. For a couple reasons, one he looks like he stoned out of his mind. As much. He is, he does look a little stony. He looks a little cross-eyed. He looks bonkers. Well and, and what, so select plus. Select him and I like how he's just, he's lighter. Oh, he is literally one of the lightest. Yep. Great. I'm coming at you Heatman. I'm at your heart. Now, now we've had the weapon for a while that we need to defeat Heatman, which is the Bubble Lead. But we needed item two from Airman before we really dealt with him. Now we have it and so we can continue on our way. The stage is somewhat difficult but it's kind of metered too. There's just well, first of all, you might want to press start and get metal blades out? Press start and get the metal blades",

Press start and get the Metal Blade out because that'll be the, the suction cup dudes and floating enemies with one hit. And that's the essentially going to be the only enemies you're fighting here with a rare exception. So remember that these guys come out. Remember you can shoot up. So if you find yourself underneath them you could always shoot up when they're coming down like that. They come everywhere. Come correct, son. Nice. Good old Sprites there. That was a really nice ship, nice sequence of shots. So yeah, you have to be careful with these jumps because these guys spawn. The good, the important thing to know is that there is only going to be three on the screen at a time. Nobody, I can't do it, I can't do it. Videos. Okay, now you have to get off me, though, buddy.

There can only be three of these guys on the screen at once so you can always, kinda-, Oh, my God. Gauge when they're coming from. Ahh. Oh, you're getting a little too se, you're getting' a little too, I'm getting a little too overzealous here. You're getting' a little too, I feel you're getting' a little shaky, like, you gotta just calm down, center yourself. Okay. Good. Yes. Yes. Yes. Nice. This is a, like, swarm attack.

You have come undone, but it's, I mean, it is what it is, so let's just see. This stage has beat me. You have, this is your last guy already. So be careful. Yeah, I got it. I mean, I believe in you, if it means anything. Keeps going right? Yep, they'll just keep spawning. All right. Okay, good. O. O. What did I do? Sorry wrong one. Press, uh, one. There. Nice. Alright.

So, in here, switch up before you go down the ladder to,. Your air A. What does this do?This is, you'll see, it shoots up 320 of those up and out.Okay.Oh, I'm sorry this is the wrong part, I'm thinking of the wrong part. Alright so. Oh, the. I hated this level when I was a kid. So yeah. And that's why we waited for- I hated it. That's why we are waiting for item two. I'm glad that, that we got to see this. I totally forgot about this part. I hated this. So the idea here on the bottom right square is to jump on that square and then quickly just jump up. I see. And again. It's easy.",

You had it. Okay, let's just patiently wait.Okay, perfect. Oh man, all right. This thing shakes your confidence, unless it's shaken. I should have played Mega Man or whatever the hell that thing was. Nice, Nice, jump off, there you got it. Now you want to switch. I, I fooled you with the arrow, that's my fault, the arrow is not used until later. So you might want to go ahead to blades.

Oh, go back and get that ah. What happened? You needed health and you could have used that health. I think I dropped it. Nice. Now see these platforms here, these special ones. Yeah. You can actually use crash bombs to destroy them, but you don't necessarily have to. You just need to be able to like jump, yeah. And over, perfect. Oh, close. You have the right idea. Oh. Oh, it spawned you off. All right. How can that even be a thing. Why is that a thing? Because two of those sprites cannot occupy the same space. Oh my god. Physics.

I feel like this stage, more than many others, is just about speed. Oh, I mean there's something about a stage that just wrecks your confidence. Yeah, I was actually anticipating. This is funny. This is going to be a funny bit. I was actually anticipating that I was going to collect the energy data drop but my metal blades have not diminished at all. So he just ran right through. So yeah, I think again, I think again getting through with speed there's like something about it. It doesn't necessarily have to be done quickly. My brother kinda plays this stage a little more methodically for instance but the idea generally is to try to keep as many of those guys on the screen if you can because the game cannot spawn more",

So you see like all those guys are on the, were on the screen at once. Right, that makes sense. And so, the game just doesn't have the memory to deal with it. And so it, it's just a different way to play, you don't have to play that way. Some people play it like really methodically, and I think this stage is somewhat difficult but once you get through Bubble Man's and Air Man's stage, you should come here, and just get rid of this stage as quickly as possible. Because it's just a straight pain in the ass. Do you need a specific a specific . Do you need a specific Power to beat this guy? Bubble Man is good to have from Bubble Man for sure because he's a pain in the ass without it. So we have that. But Air Man gives you an item too, which",

I'll show you what it's all about. Yeah, so let's wait for him to spawn. And I'll show you what I mean with the Crash Bombs. So, for instance, if you want to go here and just go like this, you can just get rid of those. Well, that's easier. It's not necessarily easier I don't think, like I don't, like, it is what it is, kind of. Like with this one it's actually not easier at all, just jump over it. Can actually use the Crash Bombs even though I don't need it I am OCD. And we keep on moving. Now here's where you need item two. Now you want to see it. This is the scariest sequence of disappearing blocks in Mega Man history. Ok. And you can just skip it. If you go here, and just",

But that's why, and this is why you need to beat Airman before you come here. Otherwise, you do that all on the blocks and it's hard. Oh, that's brutal. And so this is what I was talking about on your play through too. I made some mistakes here with you, which I apologize. This is when you need the arrow shooter. So you can go like this. And like that and then destroy his AT-ST kinda guy and then, immediately just kinda put him down. You just had like, a, like a, finesse with this, don't you? Now, who are you now? So I'm, this is Bubble Man's stage. Some call it, some people call it Bubble Lead. I've heard. From good authority that it's bubble lead, not lead. I, I always called it lead as a kid, but I mean, you can call it bubble lead, it's the same thing. So he's going to do this attack where he",

So he's going to do this attack where he shoots the fire and every time you hit him, he'll come at you like that and so you just plant the bubble like that. And since we're playing on normal difficulty he dies very quickly. Wow. And that's basically it. So all of the robot masters are done. Wow. And this brings us. And this brings us to Wily's Castle. And let's just, you know, let's just sit here and really reflect on the experience, but also enjoy the intro, introduction to Wily's Castle, and then we'll play Wily's Castle. Sounds good. At a different time. I guess Greggy's up next, and get through the rest of the game. And, of course, you know, three different times throughout the game you get different items. We had item two, of course, we had. Item 3 just a scrawl from Heat Man",

But I love the intro to Wily's Castle and so, I just wanna watch it as we, as we end this video. I'm gonna post that for this. And this is what I hate especially when people speed run this game, or try to play quickly because you can not skip this stuff and it's just so annoying. So there is Dr. Wily, and fairest Dr. Wily. What's he doing with this sweet UFO? What happened? In this big ass cyber house. That's awesome. Looks like a twisted Einstein. He is. That's basically what he is. And so this is Wily's Castle.
