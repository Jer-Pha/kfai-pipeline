Do you wanna, do you wanna explain it to people a little bit? Humble Bundle is a service where they bundle together a bunch of games for a very, very low price. Mm-hm. So it's kind of name your price. And so for this, for, if you just pay whatever you want, you get Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, and Star Wars Dark Forces. Then if you go a little over $10 you also get Star Wars Battlefront II, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II, and Republic Commando. And then for $12 or more you also get Force Unleashed: The Ultimate Sith Edition, Force Unleashed 2, and Star Wars Empire at War. So, what's cool about this to me, is that everyone's all excited. Star Wars is back, the movie's coming out",

Star Wars is back, the movie's coming out, we know Battlefront's coming out. Star Wars has a great lineage in video games. Yeah. And I feel like all of us at some point, enjoyed a Star Wars game. Oh yeah. Definitely. Maybe not some of those, maybe some of those, I'm not sure. Kidding me? Which one? Of course one of those. . Oh, yes, yes, yes. I've never heard it referred to as that. Slaughter? KOTOR. I have KOTOR, not- I'm putting SWTOR right there. Man, Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic. Now I'm actually confused. There's something else that is SWTOR. KOTOR is what I'm trying to say. KOTOR? Yeah. Yes, I know. We've covered the fucking fact, yes. Oh, The Old Republic KOTOR. Thank you very much. Gotcha, okay, okay, okay. .",

My favorite Star Wars games, KOTOR's a great game, but my favorite Star Wars games are the Super Nintendo Star Wars games. Those are... Oh, yeah. Those are extraordinary. Those are extraordinary games. Those are so good. And I think, I wanna feel like, what's so weird about them is- Not Star Wars. The first one was kind of crap. Super Star Wars, Super Empire Strikes Back, Super Return of the Jedi. I think they got better, actually, as they went along, but I feel like JVC and some, like, some weird, weird people were behind these games. Like, like, totally random. The television people? Yeah.\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n- \"The Old Republic Kotor\" to \"Star Wars: The Old Republic Kotor\" (added \"Star Wars:\" for clarity)\n- \"Super Empire\" to \"Super Empire Strikes Back\" (corrected title of Super Nintendo game)\n- \"Super Jedi\" to \"Super Return of the Jedi\" (corrected title of Super Nintendo game)",

And I feel that they. It's interesting to play a 2D limited, technically limited game like that. That tries to retell the entire story so. You're like crawling. There's a stage where you're like crawling. Like on the, on the sandcrawler. Like you're never on the, really on the sand, like really on the sandcrawler, except for like as 3PO and R2. But like you're, you're on it somehow, like- We should go back and play those. I've been thinking about it a lot. I feel like they might be on Virtual Console, not positive about that.

But those games were really good and they were hard and they changed a lot which was really cool. They reminded me a little bit of the G.I. Joe games. I don't know if you guys played Attack Team G.I. Joe games on NES. No. There were two of them. They were actually made by different developers, and you would pick a different character. You could play Snake Eyes or play as Duke or whatever, and the game kind of changed depending on who you played as. In this game, in the Star Wars game there were different feels to the game and different ways you went about things. I remember those games being extraordinary.

Alright. But then, I didn't really fall in love with games again until like Rogue Squadron, and. Can never tell when you're screwing with me. And, and then. No, that was a real question. And then KOTOR. KOTOR, come on. And, and I'm excited about Battlefront, I am but like, the last time we played Battlefront was on PSP. Yeah, I reviewed it for IGN.

It won't just be multiplayer, I'm sure, but if it was, ugh. The PSP ones were fine, but yeah, I mean, Knights of the Old Republic, come on. That's what motivated me to buy my Xbox, that was one of the big ones is why I bought the Xbox. There's Halo and then that. I didn't even care about Halo. It's just so into. I, I went to a friend's house and played for like 10 minutes. It was like holy shit. This is awesome. I I never played Knights of the Republic. I did play Jedi Knight.

Oh, yeah. $200 flight sticks, and I had to save up for ever. And it, and it just changed the game completely. And from that, cuz I was huge into like Aces of the Pacific and like Red Baron. All those games. So X-Wing was amazing. TIE Fighter I played a little bit less, cuz they started putting a couple other different mechanics in there, and then when. I think it was Dark Forces. I have to look this up. Dark Forces came out and it was the first, first person shooter game they did. It was like, it was like Doom. It was on rails, not, not on rails, but you couldn't.

And like in some weird way. And I think it was around the time of Shadows of the Empire and I remembered not liking that game. And the other game that I think came out later was a late PS1 game, if I remember correctly, was Star Wars: Masters of Teras Kasi, the fighting game? Teras Kasi, which was like, the fucking worst. And I remember that - I didn't know it was late PS1. I think that was - It was like 98 maybe, 99? Well, I mean, it must have been, I think it was like mid, because like, late would have been Star Wars: Jedi Power Battles and - Yeah, that's a good point. The Phantom Menace. I look at PS1 as 95 to 2000, that time frame. Yeah. So yeah, somewhere in the middle maybe. I remember that game coming out, I remember PlayStation Magazine talking about",

I remember renting that game. Oh, I rented that too. And, and being, because I'm like, I don't have the money to buy. I was buying so many RPGs at the time, I had n- no fucking money. Oh, excuse me, and I was like What. Yeah. The fuck is this. I rented, I rented Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (implied by context) and Beast Wars Transmetals, which was a Beast Wars fighting game on N64, I rented them the same weekend and it was just two horrible fighting games. You struck out out on that one again. Even as a kid I knew that they were bad and like for some reason that didn't affect my. Play through's of The Phantom Menace, but. Yeah. Man. It's just incredible to me like this, 1995 to 2000 era, is becoming this muddled",

You know what I mean? Does Yoda Story exist? It definitely does, definitely. I remember that, I remember buying that game and like, busting my mom's balls to get it for me and stuff like that. And I was, I was like, I'm sorry mom. Oh that's so great. Yeah because it was around the, like, that, I played PC games for just a little while. Must have been around that same time. So weird though.

Let me come back into this conversation. By, like, like, like, like. The only, the only thing I remember specifically about that is when I got my PlayStation, because I got it with Final Fantasy VII. That's basically it. I remember that moment, because I sold all my Super Nintendo games. From this moment. It was a mistake, because I had to go back and buy them. Leader.

You've got to do it, you've got to make rent sometimes. I remember getting Pok\u00e9mon Red just because I. All my friends had Blue and I was like I don't want, I want Blue. I like. Yeah. Blue better than red but. Sweet. It's way better. But I got the red and we got the link cable and it all worked out in the end. But, but if Uncle Ed was, if Uncle Ed was both a blessing and a curse.

Yeah.\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n- \"Funk Land\" \u2192 \"GameStop\" (based on common knowledge of gaming stores)\n- \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon Blue\" were already capitalized, but I added a space between them for clarity\n- No other changes were made as they would alter the original meaning or grammar.",

Yeah, they all got roped into that, same with GameStop. And, I, I remember that, like, a year or two before that happened, I was... So last time I went in I got Mega Man 6 and that was a good moment for me. All right- That was a good moment for me. I just remember the logo looked unnecessarily colorful. Oh God, it was so 90s.
