James Vanderbeek - James Vanderbeek is not Har. He is the one of the main actors in this this amazing first off, before we even get to Red Ranger, before we get to that. Well, here's the thing: he doesn't there's there's he's not the Red Ranger; he's a red ranger. I thought he was the second Red Ranger, but it's for a fairly limited time. He later becomes the Blue Ranger because time takes over - it's this whole rigma roll, it's this whole thing. But that's what was so special - that was was so special about this thing is they they actually put a lot of thought into the the cannon and story of Power Rangers, the Mythos if you will, which which you know I'm mystified that there is that deep of a I mean it's pretty expensive; it's really expansive.

When I first heard this happen, I was getting a million tweets from all of you guys. Now that's the other thing we were reacting to this very late and we understand that I was gone the last couple days and it it broke my heart that we couldn't do this right away. Let's back up for a second - this has been a project that's been in your brain for a really long time, I'm sure you and every other Mighty Morphin Power Rangers fan on the planet yeah and the reason behind that is what would it be like you know back in the day when we were talking about April Fool's projects you know when we were doing the ORS and then we did I Play Every Year - you would be like \"I'm going to say it again, this is the only thing I bring to the table: a gritty reboot of my more from Power Rangers\"",

Yeah, I mean, I feel like there's only one really tongue-in-cheek moment, and that's the Black Ranger Fitness video. That stuff was cool. You have the fight with the Black Ranger and the gangsters right, and they've got that whole little thing where he cuts his own guy's neck, and he's very nonchalant about the whole thing. Those moments were cool, but they all sort of worked together, you know, to my original point: 15 minutes could seem like an eternity unless it's good, and we're all so used to things not grabbing us right off the bat and not being original that you look at that 15-minute bar and you're like, 'Ah, I don't know if I want to watch this whole thing,' but this is a perfect example of how you make something good.

Let's put a machine gun in the Black Rangers' hand, and have them just... show them all running, and then all of a sudden it's like so tense and stuff. Then you see the Megazords fighting within the first 15 seconds of this. You see Megazords. Holy the money shot. We wanted to be the end of our thing was just a throwaway at the beginning of this, and that I was like, \"All right, I'm sold.\" Then all of a sudden you get these two actual actors talking. Yeah, I mean we're actors in the sense that we're idiots and we act stupid all the time. Uh, but James Van Der Beek, you'll know from Dawson's Creek, and an assortment of other films, and Katee Sackhoff, most notably from Battlestar Galactica, and Rick Worthy, which if you haven't seen either of those series, pause this, go watch those, come back 6 months later.",

Jones, which if you haven't seen either of those series, pause this, go watch those, come back six months later, and continue watching this video; both great actors, and both the correct level of camp for the casting, right? Because Battle Star Galactica had a very similar feel where it was serious but there was like it's kind of low-budget but it was also kind of a little campy at parts. Um, and Katee's actually become quite a quite a really good actress; she has a great look for the parts um so we cut to that scene where he's James Vanderbeek interrogating her and you get the sense that these two are both they're X Power Rangers right yes and he's a red ranger but not the Red Ranger yeah so what's really interesting about the whole thing is like this whole short is essentially the Power Rangers are being killed off one by one and they're looking for Tommy the Green Ranger right and Tommy's like nomadic he's",

I wish it was on IMDb; it's not because I want to know who shot it, I want to know who did the post effects for it, all that stuff with the interview where it's like Minority Report style throwing Tony Stark-style graphics - spot on. Um, it comes to a nice conclusion; it tells a sort of nice little story. The End is my biggest problem with it, like for sure, because they took a couple liberties with the end - yeah, like Rita never had those powers; like Rita comes and that's great, I like that we saw her, but it's like Rita never had those powers, and there was a lot of like random issues I had with the whole thing, like going back to like the fun things you",

He came out as gay and that's the reason he left Power Rangers is because the uh producers would bully him really, and so that's why he left the Power Rangers. I mean that's that's that's tough man, you got a '90s show that has to be that sort of archetypal you know uh uh casting you, that's that you don't want to see that stuff happen, that sucks, that that's just really interesting that like I love that like that's how much of a fan he is is that he's referencing these like real life things to he's basically you if you were an executive producer in Hollywood and had a lot.",

It makes no sense by the time the Machine Empire was around Rita was long gone. But I also love... you know? It was shot well, the camera work was great.
