Like this is not the serious game but by that point nobody cared. That thing jump-started the franchise and made people aware of it, you know what I mean? Where it's spread out and this always goes - I always go back to this with the review discussion of Eric at E3 from 2010 when he did it at GDC and said \"it's just about people knowing your game exists in reading a review, it doesn't matter if it was good or bad, people need to know there needs to be that cache.\" This is the same thing right? Like if you put your trailer out there and you make an impact great yeah especially for something that isn't an established franchise like that trailer came out and like that to this day is one of the most popular IGN videos of all time because of like we got the exclusive on or they got the exclusive.",

But so many people watched it, and that's why trailers are important - they don't need gameplay; it can just kind of give you an idea of what the game is supposed to be like. And I feel like a lot of people, even non-gamers, can kind of relate to that and latch on to it and share with their friends and all that stuff, and build that buzz about this game. So yeah, Dead Island was a thing before it was a game. Right? Right? Right? That's very, very important. Same thing when I yelled at you - we need an Xbox fanboy! I yelled at like Gears of War; you remember the Mad World trailer?

It really didn't start until Xbox 360 um, and so I still kind of consume things in the old way um, but you know some trailer I I really like the Resistance Three trailer, I never forget that Resistance Three trailer, the first one when they're on the train it was live action whatever the horns were playing and stuff like that, like the air sirens they get you excited. But I think trailers are in typically um deceptive and so like it's not worth getting excited over anything a trailer is showing you ever you know what I mean.

Like I loved it, and there are MMO kids who loved it, and DC kids who loved it, but like that trailer got it into everybody's head that it's going to be this crazy alternate experience where the heroes can die, and like that got people so stoked for that right, and like this is interesting to do this topic uh we just you know",

And the reason being is because that's all there is to talk about right now because we can't talk about it because of the embargo.

So I think that in my opinion what Sony's learning is like we can't do that again because inevitably as we've retweeted pictures and seen pictures they end up out there early, you know? People have them - hundreds of people have already played the game according to PSM profiles that are not critics, and this is what happens.
