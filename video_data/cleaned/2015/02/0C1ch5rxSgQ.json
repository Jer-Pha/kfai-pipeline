I'm not sure what he's bringing. He's bringing the cute; everybody loves that. There's no cute in this though - it's not the kind of cute Gamescast. What's funny is when he makes those mouth noises, he looks directly into your eyes. He does; he looks at you because he knows you hate it. Yeah, he just looks directly... he's like, \"What are you? What are you gonna do about it?\" You're not doing it right on this show. It's like the Game Over Greggy show but it's about video games and it comes out every Friday.

I still have not fought or killed anyone of those. I just I just leave them alone, you it's so easy to just they're so slow. You just chase in one side of the map and then you just break into whatever you need to do go and get it and run hard parkour if you got to do. There's one hard chest I remember I got to outside of one of the locations and like it, I I couldn't get him far enough away cuz it was a lockpicking mini game and I had to figure out what it was very hard or whatever so it's like there's like just that one fraction of a second where it",

Still no, no there's a few of those but this is one of those where you go all the way out toward the bridge and it's like he uh uh Rise of the Lords sends you out to like basically extort money from people. The second group you go to is like this little this little village underneath the bridge and you get in and it's just infested and there's the fast moving zombies that come after you like they jump and come after you so I can't really figure out what I'm supposed to do there.

The beauty of the game is that there's all these different ways to get through combat - I mean you can be very meticulous and trap them and use Molotovs or use guns or use melee or just ignore as many of them as you can. The exploding zombies are good, the guys with hazmat suits on are really good too if you hit them in the back; yeah, explod.

They had problems at Dead Island too where they just don't know or they just don't code properly progression attached to Trophies. So their games like this isn't the first one of their games that's totally botched and they still haven't patched it. The big problem and what sucks for these kinds of games is if you for instance get all the side quests and don't pop the trophy, I'm not so sure that the patch is going to help you exactly.

How like what is Fallout do that this game really doesn't in the sense of what makes them role-playing games? I think it was just funny because he said hardcore, yeah it's not it's definitely Persona, which I think we're going to talk about is a hardcore RPG, sure, sure, sure.

I don't really don't think that that's super inaccurate in my opinion, but again I just know that there's certain things that set Colinity off and it's when you award a game like hardcore no what it's the game that won the adventure game and you got all mad about oh we oh jeez we talked about.",

That doesn't make any sense. That could be a fun episode in the future maybe an exclusive one or whatever for our patrons about how to categorize games and what does it mean to be an action game or Adventure game, but I would personally call Destiny a Sandbox game.

Um, you can you can choose those in the skill trees where you're like, \"I've already gotten to the point where I can vault over people.\" I've gotten to the point where which I think is cool that you can actually interact with the NPCs or the guys where they come at you and throw them to the side.

Um, but it's a high score chasing dual stick shooter from Housemarque. I actually think Housemarque had this one out to another studio which is weird, and I don't think they were really talking about that uh their logo is when you on the game, I don't remember the studio logo, but it has another stud logo, and then it says like inspired by Housemarque.

Those those those are all nine pluses, you know what I mean? And Stardust and Resogun are frankly approaching Masterpiece status in my mind in terms of gameplay. Like they don't know what the heck is in the water over there in Finland, but like they're really nice guys over there who make great games.

And then it's also, as someone reminded me because I was stupid and just mentioned it, on Saturn. Um, obviously you're not going to be able to get the Saturn version of the game probably. But um, but if you're still kicking around your Saturn, it's on PSP also right? Yep, it is on PSP. You should be able to play the PS1 Classic on your PSP and uh, it's unlockable on Castlevania Chronicles all right or Dracula Chronicles that sounds good. It's a... oh my God, the game that game if we want to talk about you know review scores I think we're going to talk about that in a little with too uh which why I don't believe in but that game is pretty close to having nothing wrong with it as far as I'm concerned you know definitely top five probably of all time oh",
