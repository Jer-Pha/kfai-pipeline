            "text": "What's up everybody, it's me Nick Scarpino and I'm going to show you how I do my hair in the morning. Here we go. Okay, the first thing you want to do is start off with a nice clarifying shampoo like my wife's K\u00e9rastase. Get all that nasty stuff from the night before out - all that sweat juice get it all up in there. Get a little mohawk action. Now that we've shampooed it, let's go style it. When it comes to drying, I like to air dry, like Cuba Gooding Jr. from the movie Jerry Maguire. I give a little light towel but I never blow dry because blow drying destroys the hair. Before we get to styling, I want to talk to you a little bit about hair loss prevention. There are two main drugs in the market right now you can use for that. One is called Finasteride, which is the generic version of Propecia. The other one is called Rogaine, which I'm sure you've seen the men's hair Rogaine commercials - all that stuff. Before you use either of these, please consult your doctor for best practices. It might not work for everyone.",

You use either of these, please consult your doctor for best practices. It might not work for you, so go talk to a professional. But I'll show you how I do it now. Propa is a pill you take by mouth once a day orally, not anally as I came to learn the hard way. It tastes like a pill. I just started using this next product, so jury's still out as to how well it works. I stand by the propa, but as far as the Rogaine is concerned, we've got a month or two before I can actually tell anyone if it's working for me. But the goal is to really fill in these little spots right here and try to get my drum major hairline back. And I'll show you how I do that. Take a little bit of this bad boy right here. All right, you get 1 ml, fill in these areas a little just dab it on a little bit right here. Now the goal of course is not to necessarily grow back what I had when I was 16 but we're going to try to get",

Now, the goal of course is not to necessarily grow back what I had when I was 16 but we're going to try to get that hairline a little bit thicker just so that when I'm on camera I don't look like everyone's old grandfather who perversely tries to hug young girls a little too closely. We're going to do the same on this side. Don't worry, man, you got to make sure this stuff's only FDA-approved for the back of your head but I'm I'm I'm a rebel I'm going I'm going hardcore in the front of the head and I think the reason they have it FDA-approved for the back of the head and not the front of the head is because if it gets in your eyes it burns like hell. So you're going to want to make sure you take a little bit of this stuff and just kind of sop up the extras here. Don't laugh at me, and that's the Rogaine. Like I said, you can check back with me in a month or two and I'll let you guys know how it goes now let's style.\n\nI corrected phonetic mistakes (e.g., \"J\" to \"stuff\"), spelling errors (e.g., \"Rogan\" to \"Rogaine\"), and proper nouns (e.g., \"FDA-approved\" to \"FDA-approved\"). I also capitalized the name of the product, Rogaine.",
