And and here's the other thing, don't incessantly lament over this - okay, do not ask her over and over and over again was it good, was it good, was it good, that's the wrong way to do it; talk to her about what she likes and have that open dialogue but don't like, don't constantly be striving to have her pay you a compliment that may or may not be there in that department.
