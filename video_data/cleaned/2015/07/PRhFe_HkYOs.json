And as he's doing his things, then he's getting these piles of ants that kind of follow him around and build up his ant bar along the bottom. You see the little notches there as he takes these things in. That as he does these powers, then he gets more and more ants, and that little colony of ants will follow you around doing things. And so he has a bunch of different... He has kind of a leaping power here that gets him kind of a dash or whatever. But he's also got he's got a power that zips him around and hits a whole bunch of guys around him. Uh, we just did that a couple times.

Um okay, so let's uh let's go to his other tree here. Uh he also has these are a bunch of different uh uh Ant Powers we already did a few of these here. Um this is a regen power; this one does is just simply like a heal and you get a little buff for a little time okay, uh that's pretty pretty straightforward. As well as then he's got this power, this power is like using his gauntlets, uh and he does an electric shock to everybody around him kind of thing in a cone, uh and so that also debuffs the guy, so you want to kind of do that and then get in there with with some other power.

Now it's funny cuz you know Colin Moriarty isn't a big superhero fan - you're dead by the way, way to create the game and not be able to play it uh no. Colin loves ants doesn't like superheroes all that much I think would be a good fit for him no, that sounds like it's right up his alley, that that's what we're looking at, command the ant, the ingenious ant is he called on conversation with Colin all right so uh one is that he uh is that he can create ants using these ant this ant hill or whatever these are kind of ants creates an ant hill they swarm out and they uh they stick with it oh I had to heal that was good I I was able to heal uh you you've played this game once or",
