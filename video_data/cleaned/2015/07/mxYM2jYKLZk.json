What's really damaging is on other websites, like where a healthcare provider gets hacked and they have your social security number or something, which are all tragic things. What's what's interesting here is that this is a hack in which people are being held ransom for their impropriety and their immorality. And I was curious what you guys think about the site existing because I remember the site being a big deal a few years ago when it came out, um, and B what you think about the celebratory nature of some people on the internet today - a lot of people on the internet are like that, egging this on and want these people to pay and stuff like that. And I tweeted out this morning that on one hand you live",

Everyone almost unanimously was up in arms about the way they treated that guy. Right? They just found a random person who is not a public figure, he's not a politician, he's not a guy who's out there being like I'm against blah blah blah and I'm for family values; and they caught him doing this stuff. He's just some dude right, who happens to be a CFO and he's probably rich and who cares? But they found him and they possibly ruined him right. And there's real life consequences for that man now.

And to your point, we don't know the individual stories of...I'm sure there are some scumbags out there, sure, guys with 10 kids who have three families who are getting in there trying to do horrible things and offering women money for sex.
