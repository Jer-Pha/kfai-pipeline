My name is Colin Moriarty, and I'm joined today by three Kinda Funny fans who are going to participate directly with our video game book club for The Legend of Zelda on NES. Uh, they are Roger, Stuart, and David. And I'm going to now use the mouse, the hypersensitive mouse here. Where is... where am I using? What? It's this mouse, right? There we go. Why are the monitors so far apart? Is everything okay? Why not? Huh? What? Oh, well, that was great. Thanks, Kirk. Uh, all right. So, David, hello. Yeah, I'm going full screen to David first. How are you? Good. How are you doing? I'm all right, thank you. I'm doing just fine. Roger, hello. How are you? How are you? I'm doing fine. How are you? I'm hanging in there. Thank you for asking.

I appreciate that. All right. Sure. So, uh for the uninitiated, the Kinda Funny Video Game Book Club is basically when we identify a game that we think is important or just very good. And I think with this particular game that I chose, The Legend of Zelda on NES, it is both important and very good um and still holds up. So, we'll discuss the game. It's pretty amorphous.

Um, I haven't beaten the game um in several years, but when we sat down to do uh the video game book club uh kind of let's play to introduce this, we obviously showed a little bit of the game and uh I wrote a huge fact for this game when I was in high school and so I just know it uh very very well. So um I hope everyone out there enjoys it. We'll go into the comments and talk as well as about the game uh when the time comes.

Uh so Roger, tell me what did you think of The Legend of Zelda? Uh I was surpris I love this game. Like I really do. And it was very surprising to me because I don't know if you can tell I'm a 16-year-old kid. I've never played Legend of Zelda. And I never owned a Nintendo console uh before in my life.

I knew the characters of course, but I didn't know much about it. and starting it up. I remember going getting the Master Sword, going up, and then going right and going right and then going around the entire map and realizing how huge and massive this game was. And that's the point where I was like, I I I'm in love with this game because it's so massive. It has so many secrets.

It It knows that you can finish a game. It knows that you are smart enough to know where to go or to figure out where to go. And it doesn't give you a bunch of hints every 5 seconds like most modern games that I've grown up with. So, you know, going into a dungeon and finding it for the first time and hearing like and moving a block and hearing the like those are really special moments to me. And, you know, over time, of course, you know, me not having any tips or playing it for the first time, it kind of got a little bit frustrating.

Yeah, I I finished about half of it. More than half of it at least. But I made sure an effort a really good effort not to do that. Cool. Good for you. Yeah. Good for you. Unlike a lot of young younger people I'm so happy that you know you're a young person that enjoyed this game because it's just it's so funny you being a 16-year-old kid obviously not having grown up with it like we did.

I I'm 30 years old, so I'm a little older than Roger is, but I kind of grew up with the game. I was like six or seven when I first played it. And I remember we'd have we'd have sleepover nights with my cousin, man. And we'd be like, \"Tonight's the night. We're going to sit down and we're going to beat Zelda. We're going to run through it. No cheat codes, no strategy guys or nothing.\" Never happened. This is the first time I've actually finished the game entirely.

And actually, I had not gotten any of the rings, you know, the rings that reduce your damage. I was actually watching the uh the let's play that you and Tim did where you had kind of mentioned the ring, and I was like, \"Shit, I'm really screwing myself if I don't get this ring.\" So, I had to go online and I had to look um uh find where the ring was. And I feel a little dirty about that. But, man, some of those things I'm used to games holding my hand anymore, even though I grew up with that kind of thing. And I uh I wasn't used to it, man.

You being with your friends and someone figures out the answer or you pass it on from player to player, like how to burn the bush or like how to blow up a certain wall and stuff like that. I I I think these are very obscure. I don't know how the hell anyone figured that stuff out. Well, it's kind of funny you mentioned that because I was reading an article about Shigeru Miyamoto's mindset going into creating this kind of experience and he said that like initially, for example, uh the character Link started off with a sword.

And he took that away saying, you know, this is kind of something that I want people to he wanted to build a social network in and not like an online social network, but more like with your friends like he wanted to start a dialogue with people cuz I guess I don't know really necessarily what games were like if they didn't have that. But he wanted people to be conversing because you and I are going to have different experiences playing the game. You're going to find something that I didn't.

Absolutely. I would say about half the items in the game you actually never even really have to get. You don't have to get the the sword upgrades or any of the heart pieces, the rings. No. Um you don't need uh what it would be the red candle. I guess you don't need So there's it is it is it was designed to be very opposite of Mario as opposed to a very overtly nonlinear experience.

Um, so what did you think of the game and had you experienced it before you sat down to play it this time around? Uh, so to add into the conversation myself, I'm 23 years old. And my first introduction to The Legend of Zelda was Majora's Mask, favorite Zelda game of all time. Fell in love with it right when I played it. Um, the original Legend of Zelda for NES was a game that I always went back to and try to play to experience because it's such a legend itself. No pun intended. Um, but every time I did go back and play that game, it was tough. I mean, I would try to play it organically, get through",

I mean, I would try to play it organically, get through the first dungeon, find the bombs, the red candle, and after that, just be stuck. So, when I did hear about it being the game for the book club for this month that we're all doing together, I was like, \"Oh crap, here we go.\" And I typically try to play games organically, not trying to look up where to find things. But with this game, it got to the point where I was going through two weeks just trying to find a second dungeon. And I was just like, you know what? I'm I can't do this. This is tough. So, uh, I looked up some FAQs and things like that and, um, I basically did the gathering in the beginning of the game. And for people that don't know what the gathering is, it's basically, um, something I kind of find out from Colin's Let's Play you did with Tim, uh, where you could find the \n\nCorrected names: \n- \"Colin Moriarty\" (host) -> no correction needed\n- \"Tim Gettys\" (host) -> no correction needed\n\nCorrected game title:\n- \"the legend itself\" -> no correction needed ( likely referring to The Legend of Zelda)\n- \"the first dungeon, find the bombs, the red candle\" -> no correction needed (accurate description of a common challenge in The Legend of Zelda)\n\nCorrected phrase:\n- \"Colin's Let's Play you did with Tim\" -> \"Colin's Let's Play that you did with Tim Gettys\"",

Uh, once I did that, I was able to find the second dungeon and just kind of fly through the game. I didn't want to look up what to do in each dungeon. I wanted to find that out for myself, no matter how frustrating it could get sometimes. I wanted to stick it through and try to play it. I think up until maybe the last two dungeons, I just couldn't find where they are. So that was the second time where I looked up a location of something, just try to find out where those last two dungeons were.

This is a game where I imagine if I had it when I was younger I could have spent you know a year or two just playing it slowly advancing through it exploring and being a part of this world and even though there isn't much interaction with it it's just there's so much to explore and I think that's really fascinating. Um, yeah.

It's just a very simple and basic game. And I think that something that's so special about The Legend of Zelda to me is that having come out in really February '86 in Japan and then like mid-87 in the West is that it's very old and I still think it's very timely. I still think the game is fun. Like you guys were all saying, I think we'd all agree the game is still really good. It's rock solid, you know.

In other words, what what what have you seen in other games that you found in The Legend of Zelda?

No, Link of the Past is Super Nintendo. I mean Adventure of Link. But when I think of Zelda, when I think of repercussions in the industry, I think of Legend of Oasis.

Um, just because it's so it sets a tone and a tenor for what the game is. It reminds you guys are familiar with Kid Icarus. Um, but it reminds me of every fourth stage you go into like a like a dungeon kind of a special area in the game. And I like the tenor that the first dungeon sets with the music and the mood and the different enemies and",

So Stuart, did anything stick out to you as far as that or do they all kind of meld together? Because aesthetically they are all very similar. Aesthetically they are and they all do kind of melt together. Nothing stands out specifically, but it being so fresh in my mind. I will say right now that the seventh dungeon stands out to me the most because when I got to the end and I got to the ninth dungeon and this was a big funny moment for me. But I got to the last dungeon to dungeon nine after I finally found where it was. I got in there and I didn't have all the Triforce pieces and I had went through every dungeon and I had to go back through each dungeon to find out which one I had missed a piece",

So, I found out that it belonged to dungeon 7 and I went in there and I had cleared the dungeon. I had like found the map. I found the compass. I had found the item and I didn't collect the Triforce piece. That's funny. Yeah, you beat the boss and then just and bounced I guess kind of. Yeah, I was like whatever, man. I don't need this. Uh, Roger, what about you? Does anything stick out to you or do they kind of do they kind of blur together for you?

Uh, I remember just going in there and just like pushing the block and seeing the stairs and like all of that just like it was like, okay, this is kind of like a good tutorial of what is to come in later dungeons. But yeah, the first one and my assumption uh here with David is is is your answer similar or does anything stick out to you? With me uh the dungeon that really stuck out to me was actually the ninth dungeon, the last dungeon.

And it really stuck out to me because they were like, \"We want you to use everything you've learned before this point to finally, you know, accomplish all this.\" And it was really impressive. Like I I can't imagine back in the day people trying to beat that, you know, on their own or if most people did because to me it was one of the most complicated things I've ever done in a game. I mean, you really just need to find secrets and, you know, keep your resources, reload your resources, such as bombs, going through secret doors and things like that. And even rooms that are hidden on the map. And for example, finding the red ring to get the red tunic. Um, I stumbled on that by accident and I was like, whoa, this is awesome.

In other words, sometimes there's nothing that needs to be said. That's why I always really respected Link in a way. I I want to see Link speak more in a game.

But wanted to shoot a bomb or use, you know, um, bombs to like, uh, attack enemies with shields and things like that. Darknuts, uh, because you can't swing a sword at them. So, and even the rings, like finding that, I felt like it's it's it's so helpful because it just feels like Link is getting more powerful himself.

And again, we have to put ourselves back in that time and that place like The Legend of Zelda was really well ahead of its time.

One of the cool things about The Legend of Zelda that I think a lot of people don't even realize is that you can play it twice.

In the NES era, it seemed common um, and it was common for the second game in a series to be very different from the first game. So whether it was uh Mario, at least the way we knew it, uh you know, with Donkey Kong Panic, uh Castlevania is a great example of that and Zelda's a great example of that. Um are you guys familiar at all with The Legend of Zelda 2? And if so, why do you think that they didn't just recreate what they had already done, but instead went in a very much more action and RPG um uh direction?

I have a bunch of friends that, you know, would say that game is garbage. I hate that game. And I would always want to play it uh back in the day. And what I really think they aimed for was all right, The Legend of Zelda 1, huge open world game. Let's try to make it even bigger. And I mean, it is bigger. The world map and that is crazy.

They wanted to make a grander game. And you know, Nintendo's always been known for aiming for innovation, and I think with the first Legend of Zelda, they felt like they got that innovation by creating that game, and they wanted to take it even further. Sure. Stuart, are you of the same mind? Because I've always been curious about this whole sequelitis we suffer from today was so different back in the day that we got a game that was so very different and I wonder if you maybe would have wanted something a little more similar which we didn't really get until Link to the Past.

I mean that is one of the great inspirations for um this particular game. Um all right, so let's wrap it up. Final question really is more of an open-ended thing and we'll begin uh we'll go back to David. Uh is there anything left unsaid about The Legend of Zelda, your experience of it? Is there any closing thoughts that you have that you want to share? And you don't have to, but I want to make sure that you've said everything you needed to uh to say. Uh, I definitely appreciate that I I did have this opportunity to go back and play it because like I said, it's something I've always tried going back and playing. And, you know, now the fact the fact that I did actually go through it and had that experience, I'm glad I did and it really makes me wish I did experience it",

And, you know, now the fact the fact that I did actually go through it and had that experience, I'm glad I did and it really makes me wish I did experience it at a younger age. Uh, because that magic would have been there, you know. Uh, one thing I I'd like to say is that like it's really put me in the mood to go back and experience classic games that I haven't got to experience in my younger days. For example, right now, right after I beat The Legend of Zelda, I bought Castlevania 1 and I'm going through it. U, I only got to play Castlevania on like the GBA version. So, I want to go back to its roots and you know, kind of I've been making a list of games I need to go and start from the beginning and experience what they were experience what they were about and see why they were so great. Uh, so yeah, that really playing The Legend of Zelda really made me appreciate what where the roots of gaming have come from and things like that. So, I want to go back",

So, I want to go back and experience a lot of those. That makes me extremely happy to hear that. Enjoy Castlevania. Very hard game, but a short game. You can beat that game in about 20 minutes if you just pop right through it, but it's going to be harder for you to do that. I'll be interested to see what you think of it. Uh, Roger, what about you? Anything uh left unsaid? Yeah. Um, I just wanted to say real quick that this game is like it's really a classic. Like I I that's the vibe that I was getting from it. And uh whoever you are, where whatever statue or like how much you've played video games, like this is a game that I think that everyone should really play. And I I feel really happy and glad and honored almost that like I was able to play this game and actually have like a reason to go",

Um but yeah, this is a really really um good game for whoever you are, no matter how what age. And I think 16-year-old kid who plays freaking, you know, 3D video games all his life, like I think that anyone can go back and play it. I'm glad to hear that. And uh we'll leave it with you, Stuart. Anything left unsaid or closing comments for me that you want to leave with us? Not really. I think David and Roger both kind of nailed it on the head. Uh I've never finished it until this book club and I'm glad I had the opportunity to do it. I'm glad I had a reason to do it because there's so many games out there right now that I'm trying to play",

I'm glad I had a reason to do it because there's so many games out there right now that I'm trying to get through that I would never have done it in my own time. Uh, this may or may not be a good thing, but it's made me want to go back and play like I started up Crystalis last night as soon as I got done with it because I was like, \"Now I can see that...like I can see that Zelda formula and so many, so many of these other games that I love.\" So Chrysalis, uh, I want to fire up Legend of Oasis for my Sega Saturn. Like it's really invigorated that whole genre for me. So I'm happy to hear that. Well, I'm glad, uh, that you guys had fun with the game, uh, and that we got to talk about it today. And I'm so happy that a lot of you got to join us, uh, for the discussion. I hope you enjoyed it. Um, remember, if you tuned in late or or have to run or want to see something again or whatever, it'll this will be available",

We'll just export it over there so everyone can watch it and enjoy. Uh remember, you can find this game on a lot of different platforms. You can find the NES original, of course, that classic gold cartridge, um if you want to play it on, you know, original NES or a top loader. Um, but it's also available on Game Boy Advance and then you can find it on Virtual Console for Wii, Wii U, and 3DS. So, it is very available. Um, and I do recommend and highly recommend you play it. It's very affordable. It should be about five bucks. Um, and I think you'll be surprised about not only how good it is and how much it stands up, but how resonant it is uh in its gameplay, how emotional the game can actually be, about how meaningful the game can be.

And of course, all the things you find in games today that really started there. Um, The Binding of Isaac is probably one of my favorite games because it's is it is so literally Legend of Zelda. And what's so funny is that so many people tweeted at me after we did our let's play being like, \"I had no idea that this game was inspired by something.\" I'm like, \"This **** game is The Legend of Zelda, you know, like it's not even making any bones about it.\" So, distance has in terms of time has brought us away from some of these games and and it's it's important. And I'm so glad, especially David, that you're going back and playing Castlevania that um we can kind of start to bridge some of those gaps because it's important that we understand the genetics of games and where they come from.

So I uh thank you guys uh David, Roger, and Stuart for joining me and all of you out there. Uh, take care of yourselves. Be well. Play some Zelda. Goodbye.",
