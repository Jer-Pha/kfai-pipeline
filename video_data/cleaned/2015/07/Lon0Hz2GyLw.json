I'm thinking like what I'm running through my shelf Dark Souls, Batman, yeah, the Arkham games, sure. Um, Dark Void, no, I don't know, I don't know about that game, it was pretty rough.

Mhm, yeah, no one really does care about Little Big Planet. That's true. For a while, it was doing real well and then just fell off. Oh, LBP2 was huge. Yeah, but they made a mistake by the Guitar Hero games. Oh, yeah, that's really good - that's a good one. No, didn't those games start on PS2? Damn, um, well Rock Band, Rock Band. Rock Band still is kind of like a splinter of Guitar Hero, still though. I'd say Rock Band's different enough than Guitar Hero to get its own nod. Thank you for giving it a nod; it gets the nod.

I don't see how you can make a game like Shenmue for $5 million, doesn't make any sense um so there there are a lot of questions to be asked but I more shocked about how people are acting like this is the new thing Sony has done when Sony has done this before that was that was the biggest thing I walked away from actually with it. I feel like it's a game that wouldn't happen without, I mean that's so I mean it's like yeah I mean like for Sports Friends a little bit different amplitude thing you own but for this game right that is tied up and there's so many different threads to but I mean even Amplitude Amplitude would never happen if it wasn't for this like that's just a game.",

I think it's just the fact that it's a huge undertaking to get a game out when you're four or five, even 10 or 12 guys, and so yeah, it's hard when it's done, and less of a reason to announce a release date because you don't have stockholders and shareholders to worry about.

PS3 became known as a place where you didn't play third-party games if you had an Xbox 360 because they looked bad; they looked bad; they ran bad. You got them late. I mean we got games like Bioshock really late; The Orange Box was a great example of a game that was awful on PS3, um, so it matters because then it has a trickle-down effect on the library of games you get in the future and of course the money that the console manufacturer makes to put out more games in the future as well.
