Oh God, now already it's weird playing with the controller because I'm used to just doing you not like it much less things going on. You just kind of point and tap. It's all right. And also, I'm used to playing Blast so it's the vertical stuff. So this is kind of weird. Can you use the d-pad? Wow, no that's incredible. I mean, not incredible. I mean, I can think of more incredible things than that but mhm. But there's something about this. It's so simple and it's such a nice diversion. You know, you're just doing stuff. Hold on, is that...it's hard to see because on the TV we're playing on it like cuts off a bit of it. But I can get it in there right?

Yeah, and it's like, \"Oh, pay $2.\" It's like, no. Yeah, I mean, that's the kind of beauty of Peggle. And you know, the cons are this: first of all, I love the music. We were talking about that before. That's what I always found funny on Peggle, but it's cool that there is DLC on this and stuff like that on both Xbox One and PS4, but we're playing on Xbox one as you guys can see at home with the button prompts. But um, I just feel like that mobile version of any game is typically going to try to nickel and dime, which is why I have such a lack of respect for that ecosystem. But yeah, good games come from there; I mean, Plants vs. Zombies came from PopCap Games, you know, definitely from iPhone or iOS and Android-centric stuff. So you're going to try to play as",

I love getting multiple balls on at once, and I love when balls explode. Yes, that's my favorite part; it's usually most people's favorite part, you know? That's what you're always working towards ultimately: ball explosion. Mhm, oh what the... what's going on nice. Oh so that's what happens with his; it makes them frozen things that then can hit other ones cool, so that's nice. I could have used that much better then. Oh God again, I wish this was on Vita yeah, that would be nice. Everything would be better on Vita ideally. I wish it was on my damn phone but they... yeah.
