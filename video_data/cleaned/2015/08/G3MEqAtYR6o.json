You would think they're really good at a game, and you're going to go and they're just breaking the **** out of games and you know glitching through walls and flying all over places they shouldn't even be able to fly. It's like damn, you know what I mean? Like it's one of those skills that is so crazy to think about the time and dedication put into that then to get down and get down and get down like that's insane to drive your time down that way. It's interesting because I'm not a pro when it comes to this stuff, and I don't really know. I'm not the hugest fan of this so there's a whole group of things that I just don't understand when it comes to speed runs because there's different types - there's the 100% runs then there's the just finish the game",

The police and fire department are outside. We've been found. Um, but I'm always interested in seeing games that I've beaten a ton of times to kind of see how people play it differently than I do. Yeah, and um, I'm just not good at games that way. Like I could never never play, but I love watching the YouTube videos like recently I just did a run of Crash Bandicoot. One definitely no speed involved, just wanted to play through it. But the Crash Bandicoot speedrun just happened a couple days ago and I started watching. I'm like good Lord, like these guys are good. But then it's weird because if you saw them just play, they're not that good. They're good at doing one very specific thing, like they know the route and they practice that.",

Do you have anything? Yeah, I mean, I've always really been interested in speedrunning. It's the same thing I always say: I show the same admiration towards the fighting game community as I do towards the speedrunning community because I think it's a great discipline when you kind of jump into a game and learn how to just destroy it. Um, that said, I - it's not for me necessarily; there are games I think that I play very expertly, like Mega Man games and Castlevania games with like expertly... but I'm not necessarily trying to get through in the quickest way. I uh, what's more important to me when I'm playing a game is to play it elegantly, and I think I play Mega Man really elegantly.",

Sure, that's the other thing you need two copies if you're going to play in the same house. I think that's a bigger deal than the whole real estate or like different TVs, but I hope it never goes away. But I mean, that's not something I know how many people use, you know what I mean? I don't even know, and I can't speak to what's happening with these goddamn kids anymore; they're all finished basements doing all their damn things.

Like, I don't know that's the thing for me. Like The Witcher 3's out right? I'm saying when it came out right, I bought the season pass because I was so blown away with the game as is that I'm going to chip away at it for years probably. So yeah, even if I never touched the season pass, I want you to have that money, so you know you did a good job. And same thing with Batman right? Batman: Arkham Knight comes out everybody flips out that it's a $40-$50 season pass or whatever it was and then they're like all right here's what we're doing Batgirl, a couple things more villains I'm like done sure again your game's awesome take the money",

Like the season pass is content I want to get to, but more than likely it's content I don't get to, but I want to tip my hat to the developers. I did the same thing with Borderlands too, Borderlands 2; I bought that season pass because there was some bonuses up front I wanted, and then there were all these expansion packs down the line, and I never even touched them. But I like knowing that it's like Colin always talked about with cable \u2013 I like knowing it's there, I like knowing that I saved a buck or two on something I may or may not play. But it's also really honestly just... I love your game so much right now; I love it so much that I want to give it to you now.

It's just to me, I think that I understand why people are saying about this and why a lot of people don't like it because it's like WB came out with the Batman thing was like, \"Oh, we're charging how much?\" $50? No, it's 40, I believe. So $40, and no one even knew, \"Oh, season pass, 40 bucks.\" Everyone's like, \"You've got to be kidding me,\" you know.

That's why I like the idea of expansion packs, oh yeah, expansion packs are like as opposed to DLC, like but like it seems like a lot of the DLC which I can't play because I didn't pre-order the Batman game on PC is which is another stupid thing uh is like I've been hearing like you can get through this in like an hour, you know?
