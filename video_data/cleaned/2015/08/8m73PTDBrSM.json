But I just came back from Los Angeles, you know it, the City of Angels, where I played Metal Gear Solid 5 all week long, like literally Monday through Friday, I was playing it. Then I woke up today, Saturday, played more of it. I'm doing this video then I'm going to go play more; then Sunday we post this video along with a whole bunch of Let's Plays and I'm going to go see Kevin Smith but that's beside the point. Um, there's a lot going on in this game, it's hard to spoil and I won't want to spoil this for you. I've been waiting for this game for quite some time obviously Metal Gear Solid on the PlayStation one changed my life so this review will be spoiler-free does everyone understand?

You're excited 'cause Kevin's a big fan behind the camera just like me. I can't ruin it for Kevin; I wouldn't if I start to spoil it, Kevin would yell at me.

You can go in there and be like, \"Man, I'm getting my ass handed to me right now with Quiet.\" So instead, I'll go in with the D-Walker, which is the mech you get in, run around, shoot things, Tran everybody that way.

I can just sit out there and play this game until my eyes do eventually bleed and it all comes back to the fact that it's so much fun to play what I want to drive home if you're still with me here and you aren't a Metal Gear fan, if you are somebody who's like, \"I've never connected with the franchise. I don't like it for X Y and Z.\" Try this one, but get to at least mission three.

They're trying to get you a little bit of a here's what's happening, you have a lot of questions, figure it all out kind of things.

No we'll replay to get the S rank then now there's these new Mission tasks on there where you have to go through and do them in a certain thing and those aren't tied necessarily to srank you can srank a mission and not do all the tasks but if you want to get like the gold star which isn't I don't mean a literal gold star but you know trophies achievements stuff like that from what I saw leaked on the internet",

So as a player now informed of those mission numbers when I rolled on when I rolled credits on Skullface's thing, I was like, \"Oh, so that would have been if I'm a normal player who doesn't have an NDA who\"",

It really was the story I was building with my team in terms of what my Mother Base was going to do and how I was going to tackle this mission and what's gonna happen here.

But I really do believe that this is a response to that - of like okay let's dial it back where gameplay all of a sudden is super important and awesome, and cutscenes happen but they aren't like Metal Gear cutscenes. They aren't like the what you think of where you go and get a... a you know pizza or whatever during it. People still make pizzas, they order them a lot don't they? I make them sometimes.
