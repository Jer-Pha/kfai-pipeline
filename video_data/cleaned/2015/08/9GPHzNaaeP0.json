It's not, no; it's actually The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. So they made a movie based on it, and um Batman was upset that they changed it to be about The Twilight Zone okay because I don't know if you've been to New Zealand in the last like 10 years, TLC is cool. I I haven't been since Captain so unfortunately Captain's back; oh well there MJ died yesterday.
