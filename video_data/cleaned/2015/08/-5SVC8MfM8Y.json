That when the payoff happens, won't you get it right with Mel Gear? What I've noticed is that they'll just throw things at you, and there'll be characters that you haven't seen maybe even in like ten years, no setup, no reason why they're there; they're just there. And the excitement comes from the fact that they are there. You're being reintroduced into your world, not necessarily like a Hollywood film where you know you get a little inkling of that character in the first act and the second act, then that's when they show up and they're gonna fight with it.

And the game is totally been rebuilt and reworked now. And actually, one of the coolest things in December when we were there, one of the coolest moments was when Supermassive's Sue came on stage and showed it to the crowd, and they were freaking out making choices for them as you go. Oh yeah, I was cool. The timing is weird; I mean, I understand why people are skeptical of Until Dawn based on its August late August timing, the fact that two big games are coming out the next week, Metal Gear and Mad Max, so I think it's going to get buried a little bit, no pun intended, uh-uh.

But other than that, I still can't get over how you have to play the game over a period of nine days like everything, and it doesn't matter if you sunk in like five or ten minutes or ten hours, and one day you unlock the same amount of stuff. So it's like there's all the tools and different assets or can use to create the levels, and they didn't want to overwhelm players in the beginning by putting everything there. I mean, it's like Mike is being stupid, yeah, it's like the difference between Photoshop, you know?

Right? It's not one minute but five minutes or half an hour. Always been more of its nonsense like a classic game design where it's like make three levels and then we'll lock more stuff. That's what I'm saying is your attention on contingent on either hours played or more likely your accomplishments in the game. No problem locking anything, I'm just saying that based on days is stupid. But I'm really excited by Mario Maker. I'd be a little not to say that I'm excited about Mad Max.
