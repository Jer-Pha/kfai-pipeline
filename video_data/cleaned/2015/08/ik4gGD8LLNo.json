But it's the thing is that back in the day, I felt like it worked out well for the most part, right? And I've talked about this many times, so forgive me if I'm repeating it for some people. But Mario changed at least in the west with the second iteration, Zelda changed drastically with the second iteration, Castlevania changed drastically with the second iteration, Mega Man - no, Mega Man didn't change, Mega Man got better, I think, as well, it changed in its own way but it was pretty much the same, gameplay-wise.",

Wolfenstein is a World War II-based alternate history shooter right, and that's always been what it is. And so we know when we get a Wolfenstein game, that's what we should and could expect.

So I think I think that like that's what I'm saying, that there's there's a loose or maybe even undefined definition of what we're talking about yet. I feel like there's blame to be laid on all sides and because of the like Greg was saying the roving expectations because we as gamers like Castlevania is a great example, like we I had expectations of continuing to get the igavania Castlevania game and I got it over and over and over again. I was like it's just it's awesome, like when people like what's your favorite one, I'm like I'm not even sure, like they're all awesome right because I was looking for that.",

It's smart; the economic imperative is on them to do these things, and it's smart. I'd be interested to see what the audience thinks of this particular question: if there should be expectations when Dragon Quest 10 was announced and it was an MMO, I was like, \"I was a gas,\" I was like, \"You did it with Final Fantasy.\" All right, like I don't really feel like Final Fantasy is as sacred as Dragon Quest in terms of what it is.

Um, but when they made an MMO out of it, they called it Fantasy Star Online and Fantasy Star Online was huge and they didn't burn any bridges by saying like this is Fantasy Star 5 and disappointing people; it was just its own thing in that same universe. So I often think back about that game and the popularity of that game on PC and on Dreamcast and its sequel, um, which is also very popular although I don't think we even got it here.
