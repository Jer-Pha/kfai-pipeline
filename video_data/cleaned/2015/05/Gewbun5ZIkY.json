Hey Eric Meyer, how are you? What's up, Eric? Hi, Eric. Uh, you are another one of these cats who thinks he's too cool to put his Twitter link out here, so now we got to look at you here and then we get this all right. What's going on here in this picture? We get a Twitter picture; we get the picture of you on Patreon, and so is Eric Meyer the guy who's being hugged by the girl, then with the dude's face pasted over or is Eric Meer the face pasted over the girl hugging his friend? I know that's a good question. Um, I think it's the dude getting hugged by the other person, so you think it's him with glasses here. Okay, well we'll never know because Eric Meyer there's no other information about Eric Meyer that we can possibly use. We know that he supports uh both of our both of our Patreons as well as the comedy.",
