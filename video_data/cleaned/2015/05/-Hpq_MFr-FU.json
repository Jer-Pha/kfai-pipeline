Colin, you came to me with this code in your hand and said we have to do a let's play of Ultra Street Fighter IV, and I said why? This game's old, old game. Old no, Ultra Street Fighter 4 is coming to PlayStation 4 on Tuesday - let's see, that would be today's the 22nd, we're recording this, so it'll be on the 23rd, 24th, or the 26th of May, already available on PS3, PC, Xbox 360, of course. A spin-off and iteration of Street Fighter 4 from back in 2009. So just he was just doing that; he was doing the old \"zerberts\" on our belly, y'know? So this one comes last to PlayStation 4, but then PlayStation 4 gets the console exclusive of Street Fighter V, right? Street Fighter... yeah, PC and PlayStation 4 later on. It's telling me that I should probably use a fight stick - obviously I'm using a controller - and it's an important caveat because fighting fans are very serious.",

So we're going to go to an old temple in East Asia and fight DJ East. Doesn't that ring a bell? Remember when DJ was introduced? Man, I do remember - she was on Full House, sure do. Then this happened: her daughter had to go street fight against Michelle. DJ was introduced with Cammy and T.Hawk. He has his max pants on, of course. Do you feel like you know the lore pretty well?

And I think I'm pretty confident at them. I think I can beat Jason Schreier in a fighting game or Street Fighter anyway. Um, but you know, in terms of uh, you know, playing at a higher level, man. When I went to IGN and learned like what those guys are capable of - specifically Marty Sliva and Vince Ingenito - um, it's just a whole another level, a whole another appreciation, a whole another way to study the game. 'Cause sure, to me, fighting games are really very much like um chess.

Fighting game fans really don't they play in person it's still a very personal experience for them, be that second of latency yeah exactly they meet you know at Evo and play at a very high level.

My brother is way better than I am at these games; he's more on the level I think or was on the level of you know, Mark (no first name mentioned) got it, but I remember very clearly when Street Fighter II came to Super Nintendo. My brother went and bought it for $90, and we just played that game. We could only play eight playable characters, and there were 12 characters total, but you couldn't play as Balrog, Vega, Sagat, or Bison; you could only play as Ryu and Ken and Guile and Zangief, etc. So um, do a super here, and you know I fell in love with it, and then Street Fighter II Turbo came out, and that's when you can play as the bosses, and then Street Fighter",

No, no, it's just like... after a while it'll stop making noise. Ah, I see, and like you're not doing like I don't think I'm damaging it at this point. You remember the Herbie the Love Bug movies? Those need to come back - I don't mean the Lindsay Lohan one, I mean they just need to come back. Like get away from the cannon... was that when Lindsay Lohan did that Herbie movie?

Uh, yeah, well Dick Van Dyke was in a bunch of them back in the day. Really, I didn't know that there was a Herbie universe cinematic; I didn't know anything about it. So shall we? It's kind of terrifying when you think about a car that's just like cognizant, can talk to you, can move it. It wasn't talking, I guess, as much as it moved and honked. And Ken versus Rolento - Rolento is one of my favorite characters in Alpha 3; he's a cool-looking guy, he's a French Commando, and he would use all sorts of funny things, and I like how he would snap and just throw his grenades and just... he's just kind of a cocky character.

Are actually doing it with like the reverses and the crazy stuff flipping around and they're like holding each other and one runs up the wall and probably not very often. Not often.
