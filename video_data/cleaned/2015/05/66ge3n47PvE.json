And for me personally, I like performing, I like the idea of a stage show, I like the idea of mounting a spectacle for people because especially now we're never going to be able to do it again. Now the next year people are going to be like okay these guys, these guys are crazy right, like they're going to do something fun like uh that's that's going to be cool and we don't know what it's going to be, it might not be the same thing as always but um I think that going in with zero expectations and having letting people see what we wanted to do I think was part of the thing.",

She's like, \"That's crazy; you guys are waiting and taking pictures with everybody, that's super awesome.\" But you guys actually care about each and every single person, which is what makes this whole thing special. And when you say they're best friends, she's like, \"You know, the whole best friend thing,\" I always thought was cute, but then I was like, \"Oh, ****, this is real; they are best friends.\" And that's what makes me most excited about all this is",

I'm saying like in this episode we should probably recap what happened, but like we also announced the Kinda Funny forums, and that's crazy because we're already seeing all those um friendships that were made at the show they've now continued into that forum group, and now we're seeing all those people talk and like to it. It's great, man - totally unexpected. That kind of.com forums are there - people there like \"I couldn't go so I'm in Chicago, let's do a meet and greet here\" - I'm in the UK, I'm you like there's all these different threads about like all like even the Bay Area fans like \"Hey, let's try to get this together monthly\" and it's like whoa.
