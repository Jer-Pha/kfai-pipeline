We're here to play TiK ToK Games Adventures of Pip, and we like it very much. We've been in love with this game since I first saw it in the packs, and then you saw it at PlayStation Experience. Was there a show in between there where you saw it? I don't think so. I think that was the first time I'd ever seen it, and I enjoyed it very much. It's really right up my alley, and I think it's going to be a lot of fun. We have a build right here that we're going to play for you. Um, this must be a final or near-final build because the game's coming out on PC fourth right, and then Wii U June 11th, right, and then in a future time and place on PlayStation platform specifically I think PS4. I don't know if it's coming to Vita necessarily. Good, good, good, good. So you remember what's happening in the story here? I don't tell me. I never saw this opening intro. I've never",

I don't tell me, I never saw this opening intro, I've never seen it either. What's happening is like there's basically this guy's coming to town, he's killing everybody who he eats. I think every monster here he eats everybody who has more pixels and so I start off as a one-bit pixel, pixel. So I'm safe, I don't have to worry about nothing. So I just hop around as a one-pixel dude. Now you literally don't have to worry about anything this thing's not worried about anything at all. You know what? I'm sure I mean everybody's dying so I'm sure he has concerns but this is starting from the very, very beginning of this game. The whole idea is that you get bigger, do whatever you want.
