I picked everything in alphabetical order. You're a human computer, yeah, yeah, well, not really, well, close enough. Uh, Scott says any games or SL genres you wish you were better at? What's a weakness in your gaming repertoire that you wish you were better at? Colin, fighting games - yeah, that's definitely a weakness for me too. I don't know that it was necessarily identified for me as a weakness until I moved here. I thought I was pretty good at fighting games, yeah. Um, cuz you cleaned up with your friends back in New York, yeah. I used to be and I still think I'm a pretty competent Street Fighter player, for instance. But like, I never was introduced to this next level - not casual or high-end casual play until I came to California. And I remember playing Mark (Ryan) and other people, and being like, \"I'm not good at\"",

Um, and I played a lot of fighting games. I played a lot of the SNK fighting games. And obviously, you know, Street Fighter. And then a little bit of Mortal Kombat - although I think I never really liked Mortal Kombat. But then you know Street Fighter versus X-Men or X-Men versus Street Fighter. And sure, I mean, I loved all these games and I thought I was confident at them, but I'm not. You know, Street Fighter Alpha 3 is probably like my favorite fighting game ever. I love that game - yeah, um, on the PS1. But excuse me, some of these people just play these games straight up competitively. There's some people who aren't in the competitive scene at all, but they just play at a much higher level. So right, for me, I mean, like the first thing that jumps to mind is first-person shooters - like I'm competent in first",

I mean, like the first thing that jumps to mind is first-person shooters, like I'm competent in first-person shooters now, like, and I'm talking about like multiplayer jumping in and playing something multiplayer right because when Titanfall was coming up, Greg put me through a boot camp to get me decent, and I was decent. And when Titanfall came out, I hung in there for my month and a half of playing; I hung in there and was like usually in the mid-to-upper part of the rankings right? I was doing all right for somebody who hadn't really been into it, but like now I'd go back for sure and get killed. It just works on a different level for the kids who have grown up with that right? Cuz for us, it was like in high school playing GoldenEye right in Perfect Dark, and like that was like first-person shooting to me, and then there were Medal of Honor single-player games and stuff like that, but I didn't.",

I don't think that that's really possible like if you really just find the better equipment in level your character up. Um, Western role-playing games take a little bit more skill but still aren't skill-based. I don't think Fallout 3 is a game that takes really any skill again you can just if you know what you're doing and you find the right armor and the right weapons and you use especially with V.A.T.S. and stuff like that, like I would think yeah for me I think well I wouldn't say I think that Fallout was requires less skill than most of the JRPGs I've played like Persona stuff you have to know how to interact right what weaknesses are hit things in the right order when to block like that whereas Fall it was freeze time shoot him I'm out of V.A.T.S. run and hide you know or whatever sure but",
