Good, so my question here is like it really made me think, cuz it's like, you know, I'm not trying to force games on anybody, and like, I don't want to force my interest upon people. But I was really kind of thinking philosophically like what games could I show my mom? It's like someone that's never played video games ever. My mom knows they exist but has never played One M.H. If I were to show her a game, what would I show her? Cuz you know, like we think oh Mario Bros., you think like all these classic games or whatever, but it's like, I don't think that they'd wrap their head around what are you trying to what are you trying to show them?

I mean assuming that the the person the girl in question is has been under a rock forever and has never seen a Mario game then it makes the most sense to start with a 2D side scroller. So I think the original Super Mario was still a master class of gaming as we've talked about gameplay and stuff like that. It's just that you know I've never been in a relationship with a girl that plays games so I've I've never had to not deal with this problem in some sense. So I have like and it's not to say I would never date I guess a girl that plays games, it's just that like that's not I don't really want that you know and so like that is like I want something that someone that's totally",

I don't think they'd understand the first thing about playing that game, and so I think you have to start simple and start with like the fundamental aspect of enjoyment - and with that, you go back to like 2600 NES. I pretty easily yeah see. I disagree, but I think it's cuz we're coming at the problem from two different things. I'm not trying to get somebody to play video games, I'm trying to get them to understand why I play video games - and so I feel like jumping in and showing a Mario doesn't solve the problem of well that's simple, that looks like a baby's toy, like you've seen.\"",

And then we read more into them. And then games expanded and evolved from there. So I always think you should start from the very beginning.\n\nIt reminds me of how my mom used to tell me that, like, before I was born, my brother had an Atari 2600, and we had one when I was growing up. But she would say that when Danan would go to school, she would just play Frogger all day, and uh, she was a master at it.

It's like, you know, you get a nice sense of empowerment as you go, which I think is kind of a big thing for why we play video games - it's just that sense of growth. And so, I think Pok\u00e9mon might be my leading game, one of the OG ones, not with all these like freaking crazy beauty contests and pedometers and all this... no, I still think you put a Mario game in someone's hands because you want that instant gratification where it's like the first time you pick up Mario 64, right?
