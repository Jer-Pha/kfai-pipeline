Didn't she like look at her bank balance and was like, \"I don't know what's online; I don't know what this is.\" So I like it was my second last day, so I like gave her back all the money \u2013 it was like a grand, you're putting AOL out of business that was the move; it was 1,000 Irish bucks she got back exactly. Um, now I have another question for you guys. Generally, do you remember this was before YouTube but it was like maybe 2005 or '06 around there? So you know online video wasn't really prevalent then.

Yeah, they sent us a beautiful bouquet, and they're still going. That's what I want to talk about real quick. Stuff your ad up your ass for a second. This thing comes from ProFlowers. We were doing a live stream; Colin got all excited; he showed me the box, and then I walked out there, and I saw the hundred blooms in the vase right. And I was like, \"Oh, this is the difference between a bloom and a flower.\" Because these are like all these little buds and stuff.

This is now adding on to Bethesda and Ubisoft and EA and Activision, all that stuff we already know of course. The classics: We got Nintendo, we got Sony, we got Microsoft. Do we need more of these third-party things? Is this necessary? Does Square Enix need to have been doing this? And we're also going to talk about the fact that Kinda Funny is working with these guys over at GameSpot. Oh man, so that's pretty exciting.

And I think two games that they are are absolutely going to talk about which is Fallout 4 and Doom so it's like you don't think Dishonored's a guarantee, I think Dishonored is probably going to be there but I don't I I don't think that that's what's really going to matter you know if they like like Doom",

There's a lot to be excited about, and that's the difference between - and maybe it's just me speaking for my personal preferences, and probably is why I'm much more excited about Bethesda than Square Enix because I'm just much more excited about Beth's games cuz Beth's games are just much better. Yeah, so it's just like at least recently it's sad to say that Square has fallen that far from grace, and Bethesda seem to have their communications in order a lot more than Square do - like even yesterday I think they announced that they had like a patched version of the demo going live, like why are they patching demos?
