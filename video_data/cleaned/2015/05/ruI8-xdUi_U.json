I'm joined alongside the coolest dudes in video games, Colin Moriarty and Greg Miller. Hey, good to be here with you today. We got my boy Alfredo Diaz. Alfredo Diaz plays over on Twitch. Hi. How's your whole Twitch thing going? Good, good. Yeah. Um, it's just fun. Good. It's just fun. What have you been streaming lately? H1Z1. Just random encounters with people. Role playing. Cool. It's been what are you role-playing as? Uh, I usually just pick people up and then from there I kind of just feel out the situation. Fredo's Cab Confessions. Usually it's just like, you know, who were you in this life before the zombie apocalypse hit? And people give like random stories and you can't control where they go. That's fun. That's cool. Yeah.

Is this is it just chill where everybody's like trying not to kill each other now or is it still just anarchy? It's still anarchy, but I mean, it's the kind of thing where it's just like, well, I mean, I play battle royale, so it's like, how far do I you do I go using this person, right? It's like, well, Colin and I would be stronger the longer we go on, but once we hit what, five last people, then it's like, got to get close. Got to start thinking. It's like, hm, when does he go?

Ah, Christine watches in every like 3 hours and she's like, \"This game looks boring cuz you're just doing the same thing.\" I'm like, \"I know.\" Now, when you say she checks in, does it mean she just looks she's laying in bed already? So, does it mean she I've been laying in bed recently. She's been on the PC terminal. She's been playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on the PC terminal. Yeah, that's what they call it.

So, they announced Sonic the Hedgehog 2 3D and I was like thinking about it and I was like, hm, I don't know if the 3D would be cool in that or whatever.

I was Mario, they were Sonic. Yeah. Yeah. Which is surprise cuz Greg is a you know, I think having been a Sega fanboy, I know better than most that Sonic is garbage. Yeah.

It's the CPU and it just can't handle all that. So, the temp runs at like 95% which you need more fans, which is dangerous. The cooling units in there water, you need Oh my god, the water. I mean, what a lot of streamers do though is what um they essentially build a separate PC just for streaming. Yeah. You know, it's less expensive. Obviously, it's still cost like $1,000, but like just specifically for streaming. And then you just hook up your your gaming rig into that streaming computer as if it was a console, right?

Yeah, you're breaking it up. DLCs and whatnot. Expansion. Yeah, like The Walking Dead online multiplayer. Yeah. Yeah. This is a really interesting question to me because I'm a fan of physical games, physical goods in general. I like collecting things. I like having them. I like knowing that I own it. And when it's digital, I don't feel like I own it. Sure. It's always been an issue for me. And this brings up the interesting dilemma of why this is such a big deal to me of in the future when licenses run out or whatever, I don't care. I still own my copy of Tony Hawk 3.

So when we're really looking down the line when our PS3s stop working, how are we going to play those games? Right. That's the big problem. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like that. No. Now, does he mean it in the digital sense or does he mean it in the like the fact that like if I have my disc base of DC Universe Online and I try to plug that in 10 years from now, maybe that game's not around. Well, I mean that's because digital is a different rigor altogether. Yeah.

There is no more PSN, there is nothing to connect to, I never get those games. Whereas like, yeah, if Nintendo closed up tomorrow, you'd still have your Super Nintendo and all those games and plug and play and have a great time. Mhm. Yeah.

It's not going to work. Um, what I think a lot of people find right now is that 2600s work and NES's top loaders especially work and SNES's work, Genesis work. When you start introducing moving parts with PS1 and Saturn and all those like those consoles are you're going to be really hard-pressed to find a working PS1 in 20 years, like that's just the fact you know, and um I still think that like my 2600 still works and my original NES from '85 still works but it's because it's not moving it's not doing anything so I think that you have to kind of look at it in the other way in my opinion which is that a physical media is going to die, it's going to die.",

It's already happening. And um you can see that Nintendo is a really indicative example of this. Nintendo has the lowest digital uh buy-in from their audience, you would think from a kind of younger audience, a more casual audience. And yet they always show their numbers about well this game sold 200,000 copies including 80,000 digitally. That's you know that's an extraordinary amount of copies. That number is slowly going to grow. Um to me it's about more accepting what's going to happen and looking at the bright side. The bright side is that these games will be available forever.

So, because there's not going to be physical media anymore. And this allows people to explore the middle ground that we always talk about. That's gone now. You know that what what's stopping someone from making a $30 retail game? They don't do it because they don't want to be looked at as a budget title.

And that's, you know, Steam's thing. You look I look at my Steam library and it's just like, man, there's a lot of games in here.

It's just like that's that's kind of in the past like in a way the the digital revolution has been a blessing. It's just that we have to get the stakeholders and the licenses on board in in a more effective way because games do disappear even from PSN and Xbox Live. Um Turtles in Time.

So I think that we have to look at these old games will be available and I don't encourage people to emulate games but they'll always be emulations of these games too.

Just yesterday, a trademark surfaced what appeared to be a newly designed model of the PlayStation Vita. However, that doesn't appear to be the case after all. According to DualShockers, the then Japanese text in the trademark actually refers to a positional change of an element within the product rather than a modification of its design. As such, Sony's field filed request isn't in reference to what many assume to be the hypothetical super slim Vita 3000. According to Sony's full trademark listing, the registration is actually in reference to the three-dimensional position of the face buttons, not the shape or general form factor of the console itself.

Um, and that port doesn't appear anywhere on the Vita, just the dev kit, right? Yeah. That's the thing a lot of people don't know is and that's why Sony I think is shy about showing VAE devkits is the Vita dev kit has always had an HDMI out.

It's like this is a game with game music and that was awesome. Well, what's really cool too about those about the older eras is that they were so limited with what they could do.

Um, so the microtransaction thing shouldn't be troubling if it's done right. But we've talked about EA is a great example of Plants vs. Zombies 2, where I was desperate to just buy that game. Yeah. And they're like, \"No, you can't buy it.\" Yeah. It's like, \"You can't buy it.\" And I'm like, \"I'll give you $20 if you just leave me the **** alone.\" And now since you're bothering me all the time, I'm not giving you **** I played that entire game without giving them a **** scent. Mhm. You know what I mean? So there's",

So there's If they're doing it cleverly, then it's then it works. And if they're doing it like a bunch of **** then it doesn't work. But I think with the microtransactions, you know, for every 10 of us, there's one person spending $30, then there's another spending $100. You know what I mean? So, yeah. Hedging their bets there. Um, they're not shy about talking about that kind of stuff. A lot of those developers. And then Da L wants to know game delays are often but how come when they go gold early they don't come out early like which three um this is an example of a plan sticking to the plan. I think that CD Projekt Red was probably given more time than they needed. Um but the date was already established and it gives them time to patch the game too. Um so there's no reason to rush the game out and you don't want to like jump your",

Um so there's no reason to rush the game out and you don't want to like jump your release date. It's like it's like announcing an album six months before it comes out and be like oh it's available 3 weeks early. Like that's bad marketing. That's bad for you. So, even if the game's done, everyone knows the May 19th. May 19th, May 19th, you've been saying forever. That's what's interesting though, like, you know, with music, you just said that, but it's like I feel like recently that's people have been doing that constantly just because that creates those news headlines. Well, they've been I don't think that they've been announcing a date and then jumping in a month. I think they've been a lot of people have been putting out records. Well, I mean, like Kendrick Lamar put out like he announced a date of like whatever it was, March 21st, and then he was like, you know",

But some of these things are happening because of leaks. That wasn't leaked though. That was just they just did it like that happened though recently. A big album leaked. What was it? I don't remember. But I some female artists. No, some female artists that that I can't remember it. I think that it's we can't really compare. It's kind of apples and oranges. The music industry and the way they deal with albums is really doesn't it's also doesn't really matter anymore. Uh because it's it's it's just a single mentality now. Um, but yeah, CD Projekt has nothing to lose by holding on to the game. Yeah, releasing it early would be stupid. Um, because it gives them time to iron out the game just because the game is like people have to understand",

Um, because it gives them time to iron out the game just because the fundamental thing of a game being gold means it's playable and it's done and it's past certification. It is not necessarily finished. That's unfortunately kind of the nature of design today um and making games. Patch 1.01 will surely be available when The Witcher 3 comes out and it's going to have a bunch of **** on it, I'm sure. I'd be shocked if that game didn't have a day one patch. Everything does. Um, so yeah, give them time to breathe and they also, you know, again, stick to the plan. The publisher also has a plan. It's not only up to the developer. Mhm. Well, cool.
