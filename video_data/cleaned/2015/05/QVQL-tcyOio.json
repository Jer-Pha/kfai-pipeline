Full High School Musical, yeah, I've never seen that as a good movie, no. I've actually never seen it, but I played the singing game; I reviewed that for Ian - the High School Musical singing game. I bet that was a stunning review. It was... that was when we reviewed everything, didn't they? Always review every game on the show floor. And I'd be like, \"Nobody cares about Scooby-Doo Adventure on the 3DS.\" And then I was wrong; Fran would always be like, \"No, people care about...\" You know what the highest-ranking video of the day was?

We're like, 'Dude, are you kidding me?' And if you've ever been to Gamescom, which you all have - except Tim, have you been? Oh my God, the show floor in Germany is like 15 times more crowded; it's like a nightmare and 10 times bigger than E3. There's nothing getting back and forth by day three or...
