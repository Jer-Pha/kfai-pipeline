Um but this really I mean at this point Rare had already made a ton of games, Rare I mean as we went on on Kinda Funny Games cast was responsible for a lot of NES games games that people don't even know they're responsible for but I also feel like this might be when Rare became a name like a household name with Nintendo fans like it was a name where it's like well you might have seen one or two of their games, you might have rented Anticipation or you played you know Wizards and Warriors or whatever but this was the game and this was the series over the three of",

And uh there's a lot of times specifically in Donkey Kong Country 2 where they kind of lead you to the secrets early on but then they stop doing that later in the game but they expect you to remember oh I see this thing that looks oh God similar to how it did in the early levels I should probably go that way to see the extra stuff. Uh good example of that is a lot of the levels have secrets to the left of them right when you start so when you're trying to collect everything you get used to just always searching to the left before you",

The one thing I was disappointed in with the game, and I'm kind of remembering now, is why does the world map have to be so ugly? I know they're trying to remain consistent with the aesthetic again, but why does it look like that? Yeah, you know, like it's just doesn't have to look like that. It, it, it's just a pretty extreme difference between the prettiness of the game as you play it in the game as you're just stage selecting. Yeah, just a minor gripe but a gripe nonetheless.

We all fall in love with it.\" But there are certain classics that you know you're going to like, and I think this is a safe bet, yeah. Um, where am I? Oh, so I'm trying to think of all the places that this game is available. You can play it on GBA; is it available on DS? No, I don't think so, right? So um, so I'm killing myself trying to remember. I want to show you something real quick, and then... but it's then available on Wii and Wii U, and maybe 3DS. They might have taken it off the Wii shop; I remember there was some like weird controversy trying to make sure people know that there are multiple choices for them to play, yeah.

There's just little and like the very subtle almost dusk-like nature of the sky with the yellow over the tree line. Very clever game, very very pretty game, very well-designed game in many different ways. And then definitely not a forgotten classic; people really do talk about this game fondly still. MH and the series, the trilogy is I think one and two probably specific... I mean even returns games are awesome like a lot of people won't give them credit but man Returns on Wii was a great game.
