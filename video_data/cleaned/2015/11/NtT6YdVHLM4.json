So, it's like I got a legendary knife or they're not called legendary knives, they star-star and they have some unique property - basically AP points stuff, like the Legendary Super and dropped an arm which I was annoyed because it was the same arm as the safe one; couldn't have been the right arm I needed. The right arm random drops. Christine, um, it's this thing that increases my stats for endurance and maybe perception - like it gives me a plus one to both of those.

I was doing it early on where I was like, \"I really like this story and I want to see more of it,\" and go and do it. And eventually, like yeah, I dropped into a building had a companion with me came around and just obliterated, and I'm like, \"Well, I'll do it with this gun, I'll throw out a mine,\" and like none of it was working.

So how you allocate your points is going to make your character stronger or not but if you're if you're putting into more SPECIAL stats like I want more Charisma or Intelligence I want to have better speech or whatever then like you can level up 10 times and not be any stronger at all and it means nothing to like to go back into that battle so so that's like the one thing that's what I'm talking about where I'm like this is is not this is not the way I would have done it I might have",
