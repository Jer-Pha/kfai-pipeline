You're welcome, Jack. Over Jack. It's over. Jack, it's not happening ever again. Ladies and gentlemen, this has been the GameOverGreggy Show. Thank you so much for being a part of it. Remember, each and every week, four sometimes five best friends gather on this table, each bring a random topic discussion for your amusement. If you like that, head over to patreon.com/kindafunny where you can toss a few bucks and get episodes early along with exclusive content. If you have no bucks to toss, no big deal, head over to youtube.com/gameovergreggy where the whole show gets broken up topic by topic day by day until we post the giant thing Fridays as an MP3 and video for your amusement. Gentlemen, it's been a ride and I'm glad we have heartthrob now to play the rest of our lives. I'm telling you next, I want to keep playing it.",
