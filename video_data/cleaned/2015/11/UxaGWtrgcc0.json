And and like, like Rubber Ross and the worst way in the worst way possible - his levels are insane, dude. He's got me lost many hours to that man. So I love you, Ross, but God damn you. Um, I'm glad they're adding checkpoints. I actually haven't bought the game yet; my Wii is still packed up. But uh, I remember you for The Gauntlet during The Gauntlet was right when Wind Waker HD came out. Oh yeah, and you **** brought your Wii U on the plane and plugged it in and played on the game pad.

Yeah, I've played it since then. Yes, they're almost remakes of each other, exactly.
