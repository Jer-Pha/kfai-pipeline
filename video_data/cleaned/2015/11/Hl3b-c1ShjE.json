Right? I would feel bad about you know, shoes are filthy. God, though. I also did not realize you guys aren't messing around about how distracting he is. Oh, I know. Look at him; he's playing from Oddworld. The best is when he had a moment of terror in his eyes today where he thought his leg was stuck underneath the computer and on top of that, I saw him shift out and he couldn't move it and like he was trapped in a bear trap.
