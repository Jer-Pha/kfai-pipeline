Then flash forward to my end of my 20s, I got a great job, I'm on my way to being married and we're on our way to starting this business - might have been a little early for the business but we were on our way. So it's very fascinating. I don't know, I just wanted to ask open that up to you guys like what do you think overall of your 20s? Were they the best decade? Because I actually think that my 30s have been better in almost every way shape or form already than my 20s. Okay, I see the question that's kind of where I'm angling toward because I'm as I'm approaching lucky number 40, I think I'll look back how far... How far out are you? Five years out? Yeah, four years out, I'm almost 36 in January. Okay, so that's what I'm thinking like when I look back at my 30s, I'm going to say without doubt knocked it out of the park.",

So it's you know, yeah, we did drink a lot, and that, and I think part of it was what Greg was saying was that that group of friends - Dave and Eric and Nate and Charles are still here, but like we don't, you know, in sin like these guys are still here, but like we were all together together. And so I think we all hyped each other up and got out there. Ty and Brennan, and you know, there's a lot of just we all came up together in some respect. And I think that was part of it.
