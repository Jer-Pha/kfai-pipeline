I wanted you guys' thoughts on that. I mean, you guys - do you care? Give a ****? Never have ever given a **** about James Bond; never been able to muster faint interest in it. I've only watched one movie, and it was the one... And all I remember from it is where at the end he rolls over and he thought, \"I thought Christmas only came once a year.\" I was like, \"All right, I love that.\" You've seen literally the worst James Bond movie the world has to offer - that was it. That's all I've seen. I've never thought he seems that interesting or his adventures seem that interesting. And I also don't like British people because they talk so funny.

Well, yeah, that's actually one of the tropes that people make fun of a lot in the series\u2014that everyone knows who he is most of the time, like he just goes around telling people his name is Bond, James Bond. Like, oh, I guess I'll just do a quick Google search for you now. A Different World, yeah; money, pennies, in there taking it all out; she did, yeah, yeah. It's interesting; it's it's it's just one of those franchises that obviously has been around for so long and seen so many different decades of filmmaking and different decades of just decades\u2014uh, it's seen decades of decades, IAD of decades\u2014but it's interesting to me that the franchise has seen a lot of restarts and a lot of different styles in it.

I guess Sony's like losing the rights to distribute it this year, and so that may cause more contract negotiations. I don't know if they've cleared that up or not. But yeah, he's supposed to do five; this is number four. And it's interesting because it's gone full circle with me. He did Casino Royale, which was a really cool reboot right? It's very much what Tim's talking about, which is like a Nolan-esque reboot of like let's ground this a little bit more in reality.
