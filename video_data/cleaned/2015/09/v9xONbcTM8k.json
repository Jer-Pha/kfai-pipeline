Was there ever a time you walked away from gaming? If so, why? And why did you come back? Yeah, I mean there was. I I I had to stop playing games for about a year in college.

But I mean but but but but I I mean otherwise I mean that's the about as close as I ever got to to I think that's the whole thing is I definitely think there's been periods where it wound down. But then again I also think the industry was in a different place back then. I feel like we you would take months off cuz you had played all the newest releases. You didn't feel like old news.

And I was like, \"Oh yeah, wait for this thing to come out in the fall season. I'm done. I'm done. I'm not.\" And it wasn't even so much that I played that one game. It was just like, \"Oh, this is something I'm going to skip. I kind of like to do this, which I love.\" You know what I mean? Like I always talk about my Metal Gear story, right, of the fact that in high school, I distinctly remember going to a homecoming dance and one of the girls in our group of friends brought one of our friends that we knew from growing up forever.

For me, I feel like in a lot of ways I kind of am in that now. But I've never been out of gaming, you know? I might have been out of playing games religiously. Like that time stopped pretty much once my career started. Like once I started actually making videos for IGN, it was IGN. IGN killed my playing games. Sure.

You know, there's the key things that I like. I love Kingdom Hearts. I love Final Fantasy. I love Metal Gear. I love Mario. All the Nintendo stuff. Like anytime those games would come out, I'd play. That's a lot, you know, but I feel like as time went on, less and less of those started happening. Nintendo became way more sparse, just event based, right? Just like they're coming out and like no matter what happens, I play the new Marios when they come out. Everything stops and I do that. But it's gotten to the point where it's like I don't necessarily play all the the Zelda handheld games. I don't necessarily like when the new Pokemons come out like I I've played them I've played all the Pokemon. So, I guess that's not a good um example, but actually",

But, um for the longest time, like I said, the whole last generation, so the 360 PS3 generation, I missed out on so much. Having said that, I did beat a lot of games. I did play a lot of games, but it wasn't like I was constantly up to date. I always was playing them at my leisure. Like I didn't need to be part of that conversation and do all that.

And um, it's just there's something about not needing to play everything. That's never been my MO except for the PS2 generation. Um, and now it's interesting to me to see what's bringing me back to actually like, **** everything. I need to play this game, right? You know, like, **** my career in my life. Yeah, **** this. I need to do this. But yeah, Metal Gear, Fallout, Middle Earth, man. See Fallout. I don't know about that. You're crazy. Troll Speaks. Yep.

The whole dynamic of the industry has changed now. You'll see es and flows, right? But you're not going to see a cataclysmic crash because what people don't seem to just lose context with the crash of '82 and '83 is that video gaming was like eight years old at that point. Like really like commercial video gaming like from Pong. So we're not talking about like micro, you know, mainframe games or whatever, but like really like accessible arcade or home games.

It was at that point when the industry died was like all right games are over. This was another thing that came and went. What they didn't realize was that this was a ubiquitous entertainment medium. It's not going anywhere. It's just it's going to change. Oculus is going to change the game. PC gaming is ubiquitous and not going anywhere. Uh, phones, unfortunately, people are playing games on those. Uh, and tablets, um, which is, you know, fine if that's what people want to enjoy doing. Consoles, remember, PS, this can't be undersold.

Microtransactions, micro-transactions, uh, and day one DLC, and all these kinds of things are different kinds of issues I think Greg would agree that that will affect different games in different ways as long as for instance microtransactions don't wedge their way into $60 games or $10 games or $20 games in a way that is invasive it's not going to have zero effect on console gaming core gaming at all it's going to have a huge effect on mobile gaming and it is having a huge effect on mobile gaming uh same thing with day one DLC you have to speak with your wallet speak very powerfully like I always talked when I went off on Mass Effect many years ago, I",

I didn't say it eloquently, and I shouldn't have said it the way I said it, but one of the things I said was that you just if you have such an egregious qualm with the way they're selling their games at EA or you don't like Mass Effect, don't buy the next EA game. Don't buy Mass Effect: Andromeda. But the fact of the matter is none of us have that kind of constitution to be able to do that. You know, to have that wherewithal or that testicular fortitude to be able to do that. And that's the only way you're going to affect change. But since we all like to consume as we do because we're gamers, uh, it's harder to affect change on the market like that.

Does that make sense? I want to reiterate this and Greg and I have talked about this for years too. We have This is so important to remember when we're talking about this **** These we talk about the market a lot, right? The market is working things out every day for us in games. A good example of the market killing something is the online pass. The online pass was something that came out 2010, 2011. It was included in a lot of games, even games that were not very onlinecentric like Uncharted. Yeah. And people got really mad at these games. It kills the retail the resale value of the game.

Day one DLC and DLC generally and story DLC and the little anecdotal DLC and microtransactions have only gotten more and more in-your-face as time goes on in certain games because people use them. They're popular. They're making lots of money. Trust me, if a company like Sony was going to take a lot of heat and make little money on some choice they made with microtransactions in their game, they wouldn't do it. They're willing to take the heat because they make money. They make a lot of money probably.

I think that it is Yeah. I think that it's a very dedicated group of people that are very vocal and like that is what they do and they collect them and that's it. But I seeing being in stores and seeing who's actually like picking them up, it's the kids, you know what I mean? Like they're like it's the guys that are ordering them online that I'm not interfacing with, you know, wait in line. They're the only ones.

Like I think Nintendo would be making a game. My biggest thing is like wouldn't the weird place they're at with the Wii U and 3DS and NX and all that stuff. Like sorry, can give it to you. Um I don't know where it would happen or how it would happen. I think that's kind of what they're figuring out. But I mean there's definitely something there. No, there's something there. But I think the something there is that people want Nintendo merch. I mean, just think about, do you have to buy an extra thing to interface your to like let your amiibo interface? So, so there's x amount of Wii U, 10 million Wii Us out there. These things are selling extraordinarily well, like outstripping, you know, demand everywhere.

I only know people like in our circle and our friends and and it just seems like people buy them and put them on their shelves cuz they like because I mean that's why I want I wish they they were bigger and that they you could **** with them a little bit and stuff like that. But you know it see it's it's it's a nice gimmick. I I think what I'm saying here is that even though people use amiibo in the way that they're intended. This seems to me a thing where Nintendo I don't think understood that they should have maybe just released action figures of these characters and people would buy all of them. You know, if I if I knew that I could just go somewhere and buy them all of them, maybe I would. You know, there's still ones that I want. I would have loved a little Mac one",

You know, if I if I knew that I could just go somewhere and buy them all of them, maybe I would. You know, there's still ones that I want. I would have loved like a little Mac one and a few others of these characters I really like. So I just think people look at them as like fun little collectibles that let them associate with a brand they really like and and that's certainly the way I look at it. You see that Mario Maker bundle has the 8-bit Mario in it exclusively for a little bit. Yeah. Sales. It's going to be interesting to see. Yeah, because that's an awesome looking amiibo. Let alone that package for a little bit. Yeah. Will it buy your Wii U? Final question for the day. Bojan's 91. Bo, just a quick one. Why do you think there's no wish list feature on the PlayStation store? It's so annoying. Steam does this very well. They even email you when a game on your wish list is on sale.

But I mean, we're lucky we got what we got with the PS. Lucky there's a store. Yeah, you're lucky the store doesn't run off a browser anymore. Yeah, you don't remember PlayStation 3 PS Store, buddy. Yeah, there's a lot of It's funny. So many new people have come into the PlayStation ecosystem with PS4, not understanding the leaps we struggled, man. Oh my god, the PS3 was bad. But at the time we didn't realize it. Yeah. Like I said and jokingly there's serious Stockholm syndrome going on with PS3. But what are you talking about? Xbox is great. Um but we've come such a long way. So patience, you know, a lot of people jump jumping on the PS4 having no hindsight of just how real the struggle was. Yeah. Uh like I said",

Uh like I said before, this the PlayStation store wasn't even it didn't even run as an app until like 2008. It ran like you open it in the browser. I'm like that's how ridiculous. Championship Sprint. It was so weird. It was so like it was such a weird thing. So, I agree. I mean, PlayStation Store needs less functionality. That would be great functionality. My my instinct tells me that the the more sarcastic or part of me thinks that they wouldn't do something like that because they don't want you to know when games run. So, yeah. Yeah. But then again, that kind of conflicts with the fact that they do make their sales very public on PlayStation blog and stuff, but not everyone reads PlayStation blog. Sure.
