Oh yeah, Kenny Char's two endings from that topic on The Kinda Funny Games cast were my two would probably be endings for The Last of Us, which was in fact a great ending, and Flower, which was good not great but one I still think about quite frequently. I don't even remember the end of Flower. I won't ruin it for you, but let's just say really a tiger all right. So Kenny Char thinks that deluded yourself into thinking were great but weren't. I got them in spades. Really, the one, the big one of course, and I've talked about it before, so I won't beat it forever is Superman Returns. So I launched I was followed by I, I, The Henry Cavill one, no Man of Steel, Man of Steel Roth yeah Brandon Routh. Routh, excuse me.

And then bought it of course when it came on DVD watched it over and over and over again. And I'll never forget it was like a year and a half into owning this DVD I'm playing it and I'm with my girlfriend at the time and I'm watching this movie and I'm just like \"Oh, and here comes Brandon Routh's line.\" This is Superman Returns. \"She's such a terrible Lois Lane look at how stiff your performance is\" and this... And I go \"I hate this movie, I hate this movie.\" I've tricked myself into it for years now, and I've just discovered this movie sucks. You know what I mean? It's way too long and bloated. Nothing happens in it. Why does Superman have a kid? And why is there no resolution to it like what the **** is going on? Why is it the same plot as Goddard's Superman?

Oh, then that makes me I'm not behind anything. Yeah, what, what's Fear of the Walk de? Fear, Fear of The Walking Dead is the new spin-off, that's a prequel to like The Walking Dead we know.

And it's all about the slow character development. It's just for reading the comics for so long not to be one of those guys who's a hipster about it. It's just like I'm used to the fact that it's like we're going to get lulled into a false sense of security, which can feel boring. I remember when reading when the stuff was in the prison was happening in the comics - just being like \"All right, are we ever going to get out of this **** prison?\" And then like two issues later, it's the kill scene and you're like \"Oh, oh my **** god.\"",
