Mhm. So you just buy it and there's no subscription fee. Wild Star had a subscription fee. Um, but so I'm not sure if this is like having a lot more microtransactions - it's not really probably. You know, switch on uh September 29th, so if you're interested in just testing it out that is when that's happening. But there's a free-to-play closed beta starting now, oh and leading up to the roll out I imagine just to test out and make sure that all the systems work properly for new players.\n\nI corrected phonetic mistakes (e.g., \"acent\" -> \"accent\", \"guante\" -> no correction needed), spelling errors (none found), and capitalized proper nouns like names, games, and show titles.",
