We start with Darksiders II. I recently bought the original Kingdom Hearts, having rented it as a kid and enjoyed the limited playtime I had. As much as I love the idea and setting, the controls completely ruin it for me - why is hack-and-slash combat menu-based? Why not map those actions to the triggers and have the right stick control the camera? All ranting aside, what games have you tried your hardest to love but they just won't let you? Well, that's a design choice. Those are designed decisions of the time. Yeah, and that's like a gear conversation sounds like Nick Scarpino on the plane - why do I do this? Why can't I do this? Well, we didn't know how to do that yet. Nick, when this game came out in 1998, nobody knew what you're talking about.",

It's just that like every time I get in and I try to play one, the setting doesn't click for me, the characters don't click for me, and then I just don't care and I'm not going to invest 100 hours into it right. Which one did you have? You've played I've tried with VII, I tried with X, I tried with XIII uh there's probably a few I've missed; I'd be interested to see what you thought of IV or VI just because those especially VI I think the setting would more click with you okay it's like Magic meets like technology it's it's uh it's medieval but not really",

I think Mass Effect does a really good job of that. I'm excited to see what Fallout does with that. Final question of the day from Chimney Kid: \"Chimney kid, oh Governor play the chimney get some porridge my Lord.\" You see Mario Maker 2 in the future? If so, how can it be improved? If Mario Maker...I don't know if it'll be Mario Maker 2, but if Mario Maker does not come out in some form on 3DS within the next year, I'm going to be shocked. Yeah, that's a good point, completely shocked. I think it's going to sell really well and I think they're going to look at it going towards NX of like this is a no-brainer. Like we had a system that didn't have the install base we wanted but if we can make another Mario Maker...which is weird that they already remember when it was originally Mario maker and now it's Super Mario Maker because it would have been so easy to",

We fit trainers with all these different guys, can you have Metroid has that been announced or anything? Thomas, yeah, yeah, I mean people are going to make levels that are this thing going to break it in a way that they're trying to tell you a story and they're telling you to go get this next world and d and like if if they're doing it on that level Nintendo might have to look at and be like well let's not call it Super Mario Maker, let's call it Nintendo maker and you can make a game.",

But Little Big Planet should have just been a ubiquitous thing. Um, so I hope they're smart enough with Mario Maker not to like run it into the ground. MH, I'm so excited for that game to come out and see what people do. I saw uh Lucas Sullivan who used to work with us at IGN uh recreated Bubble Man's level for Mega Man 2 in Mario Maker; some like screen for screen, it's awesome, and I was like this is really cool. He played as Mega Man, that's cool. Where's he working? Is he still doing Freelance? He does Nintendo Force, that magazine.
