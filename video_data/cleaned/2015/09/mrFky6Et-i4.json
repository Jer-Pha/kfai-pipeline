You should stop paying attention to his wife and start playing more games. It's one of those yeah did you guys see that video that uh wasn't Tom Hawkins that made it, some someone else in the community made it of a super cut of Nick, like it was just me and you talking about games. He'd be totally out, just spaces out and then the camera just zooms in on him and they do Vietnam flashbacks and then naked women stuff. Yeah, was great. Oh man, I'd like to imagine that's what's going on in Nick's brain all the time. It is, I mean you know it's definitely not video games, definitely not video games... well now it is he's hooked on Metal Gear, he yelled at you and Kevin today to stop talking about Metal Gear cuz you're past",

Still waiting on two months on that uh, that Patreon still waiting on the VA version. Maybe by the time all the shout outs are done, it'll be out. The anger... No, did you see how well it's sold? No, it's already done more than Thomas Was Alone did in its first six months. I want to say I didn't see anything about. I'm going to check Mike's Twitter. That's very cool.

That's going to be hard to get back to being good. Um, the first topic of the day is why you need to play Mad Max. This is brought up by one Colin Moriarty already. Well, I figured that we can't do a proper review of it because no one else is going to play it, so uh, but I did want to talk about it because uh, people enjoyed the episodes the little clips we did of inFamous: Dawn and Metal Gear Solid 5, in which we just talked about the games why we liked them. So I figured we'll just kind of I'll present the game uh to you guys just like we did with those, and then you can ask questions and air your comments and concerns about just a fantastic game that's my first question actually is since technically this is going up today we're recording",

Um, so the game is a lot of fun, and I think that it's being somewhat criminally overlooked by a lot of people. And I understand Metal Gear Solid 5 is probably a better game, big deal. Um, but I think Mad Max stands up pretty nicely on its own. I'm not quite sure why they decided to release it on the same day as Metal Gear. I think they had plenty of time to not do that. Um, if they released it a couple weeks earlier, I think more people would have played it; it would have sold many more copies probably. But the game combines some Batman-like combat, which I think is dumbed down a little bit from Batman. But I personally don't feel like Batman; I know people like Batman, that's great. I enjoy playing those games too; I just don't find the combat deep at all in",

Um, you're basically just mashing the but and I know people are like well you can do this, this, and Batman. I'm like well if the game doesn't force you to do it, you don't have to do anything, you know? Yeah, if the game wants to be clever, it should force you to be clever. Um, this game doesn't make any pretenses about being clever; you're basically just hitting the square button to attack and then hitting the triangle button when someone tries to attack you to counter them, circle to kind of roll out of the way and stuff like that. So it's very basic, but I feel I find the combat to be quite visceral and quite satisfying. Mad Max has this thing called a fury meter where you like",

He does things like body slam people and do all that - it's actually quite fun as simple as it is, it's actually quite simple. You also have a shotgun but you have very limited ammo so you don't have to use it, and I don't use it really at all. Um, and uh what about the enemies you're going up against? They have guns - uh, none of them that I've yet had have guns - uh, except for snipers they have guns sure. But everyone's ammo is somewhat scarce there might be enemies in the future with with shotguns or something like that. Um but people have like baseball bats and just use fists and brass knuckles and stuff. Um now the one thing I think is really great about Mad Max is",

Um, now the one thing I think is really great about Mad Max is its style, and I was telling Greg that uh, I think no game makes a desert look prettier. This isn't technically a desert; it's used to be an ocean, I guess. But um, then like except for Journey, than Mad Max, the game is actually really beautiful, and uh, there's actually like stunning vistas, and uh, really just a really quite a lot of quite a lot of time put into the environment. So I think the environment is really cool, and also the enemies are cool because what what's so fascinating me about Mad Max's uh world is that everyone's **** crazy. It reminds me a lot of what I've read and heard about theories about Batman about how everyone's insane in that world, even Batman, and it's just a level of how insane or not insane you are um, and that's kind of the case in this world like Max is just as",

I think people are being unusually hard on this game. Yeah, and that's fine, I mean, you know, people are entitled not to like the game. I mean, if people don't like the game, that's fine, not calling anyone into question about that. But the general way I've heard people talk about the game is like, I'm a little confused about why people feel a certain way about it.

Like I play Metal Gear mainly for the story; the gameplay is like second to me, but it's like this is totally winning me over. The other way where the gameplay is awesome and there is a story - all those reviews scared me, like even talking to Greg early on, I was like, oh man, getting playing it, there is a story.

But no offense to The Witcher series, which is based on you know polish novels, and people really enjoy those games and enjoy those stories, and they're probably more coherent stories maybe even better told stories than Metal Gear.

Oh, you know, Xbox said that Sega said this. 140 characters that are just people talking about on forums, threads on threads on threads of just you know, 140 characters that somebody said.

So do people are people being heard and listened to? Yeah, I think they are, but are some things getting swept under the rug or like being kind of shrugged off and stuff like that? It's like that's not good business either. But I think there's a difference though specifically between the backwards compatibility and this where the backwards compatibility - it's not something like that people were asking for, that they wanted you know, and like I think before the Xbox one came out they would have asked for it but then once they said it's not happening it's not like people are like oh man please make things backwards compatible they're just like it's not going to",

I will, I will throw in real quick before we move on to the next question that I mean, I understand why people like it - yeah, it's totally one of those games I respect and understand, and it's just not my opinion - it's not for me either. But I will say that a lot of people ask like, why I like side-scrollers so much and just old games, and I'm like because these games feel great still - yeah, before things got too complicated. This is the way games controlled, and they still control the same as Rogue Legacy controls exactly the way Mega Man controls or Castlevania controls, the speeds in the in-game systems and all those kinds of things are different but that's why I love those kinds of games - they're Timeless, that is.\"",

Yeah, all right. Second one now Metro Shade, it's your time to shine. Metro Shade, what are your thoughts on fan bases of certain games? I recently finished the Dragon Age series and was really captivated by the tone. I poked around online and found huge dedicated fan base communities to the games, but not just the game characters, romances, etc., especially around Tumblr. Have you guys ever been a part of a fan base like that, and if so, which ones, and to what extent? This actually brings me up a point I meant to make in Colin's where he was like I don't think now a Witcher, but I think the Witcher Community is huge too, and and you know what you're talking about Metal Gear.
