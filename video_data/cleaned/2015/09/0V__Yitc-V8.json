So, so we have these horses that everyone's just riding bareback, and then they realize they can put spurs on their boots and kick them. It's like it's kind of...up when you think about it. It's kind of up, but like that's what they're used to; that's their natural condition. I have no problem with it. We have thousands of cattle killed every day just to feed us, and I'm fine with that.

So when you come to the gate, you're trying to get into the actual airport proper, you have to have a ticket, you have to have your ID, you have to get scanned; they have to do the hands thing to Tim every single time it really happens. I'm curious why that is. So I started asking every single time. For people that don't know, even though we've explained 10 million times, we get through the TSA security thing and then you walk through the dumb thing when you put your feet on the yellow markers and you have to put your hands up and look like a goddamn fugitive.
