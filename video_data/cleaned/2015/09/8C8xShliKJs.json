I taught you guys some stuff; you taught us a lot of stuff. Specifically the words lit and sus - yes, which are two opposite ends of the spectrum that anything can be judged on pretty much: is it lit or is it sus? Yeah, we cannot stop using these words in our daily vocabulary. It's now a thing. #hashlit is probably my most used word on any social media platform. I want you to teach us more, more.

People, damn it's lit. That's lit. It's lit. The DJ's going ham like it's lit. If you walk in at 10 p.m., let's take a step back because you're using you're throwing all sorts of terminologies.

Michael Jackson - Michael Jackson was bad. That means good. Greg, oh so ham. When when I call someone a ham, that means they're a goofball. You're a ham.
