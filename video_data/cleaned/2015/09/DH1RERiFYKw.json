It it killed me playing as much as I wanted to last night. I was going to say this is the problem: it came out right and we're still in a Metal Gear mode, but we have to play this game as well. God! So have you played any Mario Maker? Not yet. No, are you familiar with the looks? Freaking awesome - holy **** it is such a good game. And the thing is, it is a game I am very happy with how much they have made making a game like actually making the courses and stuff, and having like the way that they teach you how to do this stuff the first time you boot it up, and like you, you have to make a stage, and the way that they teach you it feels like a video game even creating the stuff feels like it. And I love that. And then you play the levels, and it's like this is **** Mario, and the subtleties that they add, and like the people... I am obviously very",

Wii U or whatever the heck um the differences between that stuff this game is so much deeper than I gave it credit for interesting that's off my my first impressions what what do you think about that deeper yeah than what you thought it was I'm I I don't know I don't know what I thought it was you know I mean I played it at events here and there obviously and when you're playing events it's like oh it's Mario okay drop and do stuff",

And I was like, \"That's really fun.\" A weird thing happened where the stream ended, went to Eric Castaneda's house that night, our friend, of course, MasterBater from Follow the Leader. He had just bought it; we played it. We pass the controller and like seven people who were there drinking having fun. Where son dies pass the controller and try the next one.

You can save anytime you play a level, you can save it. Uh-huh. So once you play it, like find there's... I don't know, that menu we saw. It's wherever you save all your levels, like you have a levels thing that you can save them all and from there you can save world so you can make a whole game with it. You can like name the levels one, one, two, 1, 3, four... and then have a world one folder and then it goes in there and so then you can make the whole game.

Seeing that and as that's my first... that's what my brain kind of goes to is like, \"Oh, make a level where you just start and then you slide, and that's it,\" and then everything else is just taken care of by the person who made it. That's what it is, but then they add all these crazy hazards so it looks like he's in a lot of danger, but like, it's not because it's a predetermined physics thing, right? And what's cool about that though is watching them; it's like, \"Oh, this is dumb,\" 'cause that's all it is, but then you start to understand on a deep level the limitations of the game and how the game works and the cool things you can do.

Right, uh, somebody in the chat was like \"you should play one of our my levels\" and I was like \"oh yeah, maybe we will.\" And then they sent over the thread from Kinda Funny.com forums where all the best friends have posted it.

And so it's like that challenge is the challenge, and then you beat that move on to the next level. For me, it's a little off-putting 'cause it's like I want that Mario experience of like beating the game - you don't beat this game; you just beat levels. Yeah, you know?
