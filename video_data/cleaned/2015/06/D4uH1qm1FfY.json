Lee to be the general, and he said, 'Virginia is my country,' and then he went to the South - damn big mistake, big mistake. Depends on how you look at it. Robert E. Lee lived a pretty fruitful life after the war, which is a problem. And this is what I'm coming down to with it. I think a lot of it requires a little bit of historical knowledge, which I think you guys might have, but I think a lot of people don't.
