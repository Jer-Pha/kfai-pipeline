Oh man, there were so many good games. Colin, yes. What is the Kinda Funny Game of the Show? Horizon Zero Dawn by Guerrilla Games, yay. The name still isn't natural to me, I'll tell you that right now. I often mean granted we're sleep-deprived and stupid, but when we were on the show, and I wanted to talk about it, I was like, \"The new Guerrilla game,\" cuz like I always get hung up on Horizon, let alone Zero Dawn.

See now, that's the thing - on the PlayStation blog, there isn't a colon after Horizon zero Dawn by the end of it. But in their headline, there wasn't one either. That can't be right. You're telling me Sid Shuman was wrong? Yeah, I am. There's no way that game's called Horizon: Zero Dawn without a colon. Without... I calling it, it doesn't even make any sense. I'm just letting you know, bro. He's just telling me what he knows, all right. Well, I appreciate it nonetheless. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm just staring off into space right now. No, no.

Their hit points pop out of them just like in a lot of action RPGs. Um, and then they showed that giant, kind of Tyrannosaurus Rex-looking creature, and they were saying that the thing has like hundreds of hundreds of animations, um, and 12 attacks. And they showed like a lot of them, like they're just playing with it to show like how many times they can attack. And there's like all these different weaknesses you can knock all the plates off in different ways to like expose different parts of the core. And like that the game is awesome.

You have to assume there was some symbiotic relationship between them. I'm sure they went back and forth with tech. But I remember at the PlayStation 4 launch, they talking about the fact that we wanted a new Killzone; we wanted a place for players to start. And I think the main thing people hear when people want to talk crap on Killzone is that it's brown. Yeah, I mean, I'm not a kill... I'm not that's what's so surprising about this to me too is that I don't think Guerrilla makes bad games; I don't think they even make mediocre games.

I don't think it's really relevant, actually, which one really won, but um Microsoft I think had the significant um messaging and the most significant announcement overall, which I still think is backwards compatibility. I think that's a significant huge step for them. I think unifying their digital and physical hard or re uh libraries rather across those platforms is very smart. I know it's going to be an incremental thing they're going to start with 100 games and go from there, but this potentially opens up a thousand new games for Xbox One ultimately, and that's a huge deal.

And everyone when I was like, \"Oh, what was your favorite thing you saw?\" That was their answer: \"You need to see that.\" You need to see that. So, everyone who saw it - that was their thing of the show. So, that's impressive. Yeah, and then um with Nintendo uh I never really got to play any of their games so I can't speak to those um what I was surprised about and I tweeted about this today because I'm kind of behind on news like I went out with a friend of mine he's like oh you see Heavy Rain's coming to PS4 and I'm like what the heck are you talking about and he's and he's like he's like it was announced like three days ago you're usually like way on top of this stuff I'm like I have no idea",

They're clearly in a space in between right now, like they can't do anything right now, their hands are tied. They're probably migrating some of their games over to NX and they don't want to talk about the hardware, and their 3DS is doing fine. But like there's a real visceral negative reaction I think to Nintendo's showing at E3 this year. And I did not even know that or was aware of that until we're recording this on Thursday morning.

But with Nintendo, it's like I feel like there's just an expectation with Nintendo where people expect to see F-Zero announced and expect to see Metroid Prime and expect to see all these things, and it's like in a lot of ways it's like yeah, why aren't we getting them? But at the same time, it's like I don't know, Nintendo has its directs all year, and then when they have their one direct, it is competing against the others, so that's why it gets confused. Nintendo's marching to their own beat, and I think it's to Colin's point that yeah, they're prepping for NX right, so you can't put everything out.
