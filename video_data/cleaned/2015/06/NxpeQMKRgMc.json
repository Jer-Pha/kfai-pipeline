We're posting it when E3 is said and done, yes, because we can't record an episode during the week of E3. A normal episode recording at this point, you'll have already known this, but we're recording special E3 Gamescast throughout the week. Sure, so it's going to be fun. So we're going to do something different because we don't want to be talking about news and stuff from the future that we don't know - that'd be presumptuous or boring. Stuff from the past, or that too. Wonder if Neil Druckmann came out at E3 and then he came out on stage, everybody's like 'Hey, Neil Druckmann's here!' Like if we said that now, we would look stupid. I'm gonna call this right now - Colin was right about everything. What a surprise! Points get in front of the table and genuflect at his feet. Why don't you? I think that Colin was right that we're probably going to see it in some shape or form, maybe a trailer early, maybe a week or two.\"",

Um, so that's one of the top ones on my list. This is not in any ranked order specifically. The next one I have is another one of those games that I played religiously, never beat because I'm terrible at strategy games, but it's XCOM - it's one of those games that I didn't realize was such a big deal until I started working at IGN and when they started doing top lists, I saw it pop up.",

It's all the movies that he's done, including The World Is Not Enough. Yeah, Die Another Day is one of the worst Bond movies ever made. Which one was that? Is that the one I've only seen in full? That's The World Is Not Enough. Yeah, the best Bond is Pierce Brosnan. Literally one of the worst.
