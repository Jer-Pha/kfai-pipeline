It's a bunch of tech guys trying to dance; it's that'd be awesome. We should do that show. Okay, that's kind of the equivalent of uh the basketball leagues that they do for tech people. Uh-huh.

He told me today uh by the way, I learned this uh was going to go to Northeastern decided not to go to college; scorned Northeastern and did his own thing instead, and now look at him. You know what Northeastern has never been the same? No, they'll never bounce back. No, we're not... well, the funny thing is that if if you went to Northeastern there could have been an alternate history timeline where uh you put them on the map for tech because right now they're really not on the like like the biggest thing for tech that ever came out of Northeastern is Napster.

Russia's giving a lot of oil to Eastern Europe and Western Europe.

You know what I mean? Things like that will happen. But I think to James's point, the more interesting question is, what happens to the countries that have dependent economies dependent on oil production - and again, the big ones to me are Venezuela, Russia, uh, and especially the Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, and all these other countries, like... and the answer is they're **** because they sacrificed I think smartly so maybe diversifying their economy because they were making hand over fist money you know on oil for decades and decades in pipelines.

So do they adapt to something else, which is impossible for them to adapt their economy to something else, and then does it basically look like Spec Ops: The Line, and all these abandoned multi-million dollar structures are just there? Yeah, so my personal opinion, you guys could say whatever you think to finish. We generally do um I think that it may lead to another war and we'll have really bad extremist groups because they have nothing else to live for, so the war is just because they have an axe to grind over the fact even Russia, like Russia's economy is still oil, yeah, you're talking about one of the biggest countries in terms of GDP and we're",

Yeah, you're talking about one of the biggest countries in terms of GDP, and we're just removing their biggest asset. And they've already kind of proven that they're unpredictable. But the thing with it is, like, do you think it leads to a World War III if it's like you were talking about in your scenario, where it's a switch flipped or if it's decades? I think it would start out as extremist groups and as the extremist groups grow and take over other areas, then it would grow into something bigger. I mean, overnight, not all the countries are going to go to war against each other. It would be yeah, it would be interesting because you already see it well, it's not related to oil obviously but with ISIS like really spreading in Iraq and Syria, whatever, and basically becoming like an autonomous country.

I think I mean some countries would have gone because we're allies, but NATO is a thing where it's like that's what activates during a war.
