Okay, this game is very physics-based; there's a lot of your weight and all that stuff, so I can't just jump off okay. There are spikes - look how gruesome that is! Yeah, I think I just impaled my jawline. All right, is there any kill count at the end to see how many times I died? I don't know; I'm not that far. But oh, you got to jump. I tried this controller has the responsiveness of a dead dog. So speaking of dead things... so the idea here is the game is called Limbo, right? So I'm not sure about Stu in Libo - is that so? Basically, I'm a child, but I didn't think children would go to limbo; thought they got a pass before 13. No, Kevin, you're from Peru - aka the other limbo! All right, so I've got to jump... yeah, jump. Well, this thing's not working okay. This controller is let me see... yeah, want to make sure try it why don't",
