Yes, I am. That's what I'm doing right now. Just making sure my Nintendo predictions begin with the announcement that Nintendo has made a deal with Amazon.com and Nintendo products will be sold on Amazon.com normally and not all **** up through third-party sellers. And everything's going to be okay. You're dreaming, buddy! What I don't really know anything about this. Can you can you explain this to me? Sure. If you've never tried to order something Nintendo related off Amazon, you cannot. Why? Cuz they don't get along. Why I don't I don't know if there's ever been a historical reason has this happened. It's been going on since probably the late Wii era. I kind of vaguely remember this. I'm going to look it up for you. Okay. It's an issue. My first Nintendo prediction is that Star Fox opens the show, is fully well they're going to do a Nintendo presentation.",

It's an issue with my first Nintendo prediction: Star Fox opens the show; they're going to do a Nintendo Direct, but we'll just refer to it as a conference. Uh, Star Fox is the first thing shown. Um, they show it in an intense look at it and it's dated for this fall. Oh god, um, I'm so excited. They have to get that game out; you know, like that game is basically the only thing between it and Zelda of any consequence. And I don't mean that as a disrespectful thing because I'm most excited about Mario. But the fact of the matter is unless they have a big first-party announcement, which they don't \u2013 because if they're smart, they're moving all their resources to their next console \u2013 um, Star Fox is too far along to move. And so I think that, uh, that is a safe assumption. I'm so excited for that; that might be the thing that I'm looking forward to most. Is I just want to see it and like that's one of",

And I'm very worried it's not going to be what I want. We see - I don't want to see no on football **** no on foot **** I like that - I like the on-foot stuff in Star Fox Adventures personally, on GameCube. Okay, but Assault was that the second one where there was it was like not majority it was about a third flying? Oh so you're saying I see what you're saying. So a mixture kind of like um like uh the Star Wars game on N64 where you sh - and was a disaster. Rog, we're getting now. I'm talking about Shadow the Shadows of the Empire game. Okay, my apologies.

So I think that now is the time because this is a Japanese-centric move, but ultimately for growth they need to show these games to the west and start acclimating them earlier because the Japanese Market's already acclimated to these games, or these style games, and certainly DNA-style games since they're such a big Japanese developer. So um I think we'll see DNA's games, and I don't think it's going to be like a passing thing; I remember Dena owns one-tenth of Nintendo now, so they have a little bit of pull on what is going to be shown, what's not going to be shown in these Nintendo directs, and it wouldn't surprise me to see",

We music too. No, no, no, no. Do I have one more right? Oh, do you? Yeah, for for one more, you had to make it up though on the spot. I'm I am going to make it up; uh, they tease and they do it in an ambiguous sort of way because it's not going to be a Wii U game, but what you're going to see is the first tease of an NX game without saying it so it's like going to be a Watch Dogs type.",

And because it's a Nintendo Direct, and they're not necessarily exposing themselves to journalists, and Nintendo obviously will have a strong presence at E3, but you assume that interview opportunities are going to be somewhat scarce with big outlets. You're not exposing yourself to a barrage of questions; they can then retreat back to their offices in Kyoto and do go about their business without really being exposed, as say Sony or Microsoft would be by revealing a game with an ambiguous kind of nature. So I think that that would be my fifth guess. Excellent, excellent. Love it, love that so much.
