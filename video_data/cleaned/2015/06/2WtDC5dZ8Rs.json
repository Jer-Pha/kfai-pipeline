A normal episode recording at this point, you'll have already known this, but we're recording special E3 Gamescast throughout the week. Sure, so it's going to be fun. So we're going to do something different because we don't want to be talking about news and stuff from the future that we don't know - that'd be presumptuous or boring. Stuff from the past, or that too. Wonder if Neil Druckmann came out at E3 and then he came out on stage and everybody's like, 'Hey, Neil Druckmann's here!' Like if we said that now, we would look stupid. I'm gonna call this right now - Colin was right about everything. What a surprise! Points get in front of the table and genuflect at his feet.

Now that that's out of the way, Nick, yes, what are your favorite games of all time? Yes, brother! Well, you know obviously I'm not as hardcore of a gamer as you guys are, so when I think of the games that I've played or my favorite game, I have to think back to the games that I was like religious about - like the games that I craved when I was in high school or junior high. I'm like, 'I got to come home and I got to play this game.' And one of the top ones on my list has got to be Doom.

And it was one of those instances where I was like, \"Well, first it was the maybe one of The Originators of piracy as well.\" Because we; he gave it to every single person. We were just like, \"Here, install this! Install this! Install this!\" I'm sure EA software really loved that back in the day. Um, but that was one of those games you installed because, like you, I had seen it somewhere and I'm like, \"I have to have this. I need to play this game.\" And I had to figure out like how to if my system specs were correct that they could they could play the game. And like had to go into my BIOS and like turn stuff off so it wasn't taking RAM so that I could like free up like the two megabytes of RAM that my computer had.",

Um, so that's that's that's got to be top one of the top of my list. This is not in any ranked order specifically. The next one I I have is another one of those games that I played religiously never beat because I'm terrible at strategy games but it's I'm going to give it to XCOM.

I'm like, 'Oh, you guys know XCOM,' and everyone's like, 'Yeah, we know XCOM.' And it was just to me it was one of those games where, like, you can't judge a book by its cover, but uh, you can because this cover - the cover was awesome. He flipped around, you're like, 'You're like holy crap,' uh, this looks like my kind of game. It was right in the time when I was super into The X-Files as well, and so it had that alien conspiracy vibe, everything with the X's, they really had a nice connection.

I'm better than you at Smash Bros.\" Everyone just uses **** Kirby and throws incessantly, but like Melee really kind of took it to that next level.

It was a suitable fitting swan song for Nintendo 64, and I don't think people really put them together that way because it wasn't necessarily the last Z you know or last N64 game. Something called Conker's Bad Fur Day and I remember getting my last purchase on N64 was Dr. Mario. Um, goddamn, you were riding to the end. Oh, definitely. Um, I was a big Nintendo fan; I don't know that's loss on a lot of people. I was a huge Nintendo fan when I was a kid, huge. But Majora's Mask - the themes of Majora's Mask fit perfectly with the end of N64 and almost told a story about N64's own troubles in a weird kind of way where it was just like imminent collapse of this platform and destruction and death and trying things over and over again and stuff like that.

Right, those were both very special games a lot of people gave **** to uh Final Fantasy VI would be number four for me um with the exception of another game on this list I think the best Japanese role-playing game of all time perhaps the media Japanese role-playing game of all time too uh huge cast of characters something like 20 characters you can play as um you don't have to find them all which I think is even cooler you can let characters die like Shadow.",

In other games, you start going back and realizing there's a little side quest and people to talk to and all this kind of weird stuff, and then when you get to the World of Ruin, you start realizing that there's characters you can totally never run into at all, like Yaro and um and Goof and stuff like that.
