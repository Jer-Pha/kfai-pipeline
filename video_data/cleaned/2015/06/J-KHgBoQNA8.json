He talks about meeting the actors in Interstellar, then gets into the science, discussing Gargantua, a black hole, and wormholes, explaining how these things could happen and are somewhat realistic. My topic is things that you know are real or think are real that you've learned about in science, whatever they may be, that you can't believe are real but like they're still mind-bending and you believe they're real \u2013 it's just insane. That's crazy. For my example, it is real, but it's so mind-bending that it's astonishing. And what are some of the things that you guys know to be true that are still hard for you to accept or believe? One of the things I was thinking about was when they land on the water planet M, which is awesome \u2013 yeah, awesome giant waves going by destroying everything, the planet has heavy gravity, and the planet...",

The planet has heavy gravity, and it's covered in a very thin layer of water, so they can stand in it, and there's a perpetual tidal wave going around the planet because it revolves or rotates, but then Gargantua consistently pulls out just like our moon does with our tides, but the wave happens to be two miles high and never stops. But the bigger thing that was crazy to me is that it's so close to the black hole that it dilates time, so they're on the planet for an hour, and they get back to the space station, and the guy there is 26 years older and has been waiting for them for 26 years when they were only on the planet surface for an hour.

Um, and then he did all that science that ended up not being important anyway because you know they were lied to, but the but uh so he just wasted all this time. But that was one of the things where I was like holy like because I've read a lot about time travel and time dilation; it's really interesting, obviously. The the quicker you go, the more time slows down, and they were talking about experiments Kip Thorne talks about in his book, experiments that were done at Harvard where they would shoot lasers from like the top of a building to the bottom of a building and see how",

Um, so basically large gravitational objects that create large gravitational poles screw up the spacetime fabric okay and what it does is like because of the large gravitational pole um I'm trying to think of the best way to describe it - how do they described in the movie? They fold over a piece of paper yeah and explain that if this happens then well here's, here's the best example I can think of and this is how it was explained to me when I was a kid right. You take a piece of rubber right and you expand it into a room and then you place a ball in the middle of it right - the ball is going to sag the rubber in the middle and so the fabric of spacetime is like a straight line right, and when time is...",

And when time is traveling and then goes into one of these wells - gravity wells, like Earth or the Sun or whatever creates time dips. And when you go into a black hole, which, like, you can't even see through, and nothing can escape, including information, light, or time, you can't even see into them because nothing escapes once you cross the Event Horizon exactly. Once you get to like... once you cross the Event Horizon, it's that's why you can't see into a black hole because there are things there possibly, but you can't nothing escapes, right? It's because it's because nothing couldn't get out of the black hole. Well, it's yes, thank you, Nick, but it's it's because it's because the rubber, like, is being bent just a little bit by the planet, but by the black hole, it's like a hole - everything just goes into it and",

So you're telling me that Matthew McConaughey can't hack into a drone that the drone that's flying in the air he can't do that. I like that whole thing with the vacuum cleaner thing; yeah, like Weird Science the bigger question to me is like and it's I want to read more about Nolan's like idea for this universe is like there's I I this is a spoiler I mean people hopefully you're not watching at this point if you really want to see Interstellar no but there's they know don't touch me there's a scene where the Yankees are playing yeah but it's like some Bush League Yankee team in front of like 20 you know two you know 200 people or something like that right and my bigger question about Interstellar is like what happened to the planet, like where is everyone, how many people are left?",

But then you accidentally trip and fall out of a window and the spacecraft decompresses and you all die. We went all this way, Scarpo, that's like a Twilight Zone episode that'd be hilarious. Um, I don't know. So that was like that. I just wanted to talk about that and I guess we all kind of agree that maybe those are some of the biggest questions we have or some of the...I don't know. 'Cause that movie was mind-blowing, you know? I really want to read a lot about it afterwards. I was like this is and some of the stuff I know about already, I know about black holes, I know about you know time dilation and stuff like that at least in in a rudimentary way but I want to read more about it.

It goes back to what I was saying at the beginning, where I was just like there are these left brain people man who are revolutionizing everything you know and it's it's awesome. And so Interstellar was cool, people should go see it, I'm sure most of you have already since you're way cooler than I am. Yeah, it's you know the one thing I'm I'm disappointed with uh in your situation Colin is that you didn't see it in IMAX. Going back to it, it's the future oh man Interstellar really was an experience, it actually was.
