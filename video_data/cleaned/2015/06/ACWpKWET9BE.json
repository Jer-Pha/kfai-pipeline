A Japanese-centric game like Dragon Quest might be unusual to announce at E3, but they want to globalize that franchise clearly. So I mean, do you think they're going to talk about their games like Just Cause 3 and Hitman? And all that stuff? Like, I think they'll just reveal it all out there, yeah. Oh yeah, no, I don't disagree. But they have to square up with Square Enix is still a Japanese company, you know, and they have to say something about the games that are being made at home, you know, other than what's been announced. Cool, that's the Square Enix conference. They announced Kingdom Hearts 3 is coming in 2016. Oh wow, that's bold. That's bold. We're basing that on Goofy does goofy come out and do it? No, Goofy doesn't say anything. What does he say? You **** yeah! It was supposed to be guys **** you, I told you it was going to be 2015, but he's wrong, 2016. This one's confirmed.

Oh okay to make sure I have my notes correct that's an interesting one so Mass Effect 4 2016 Mass Effect Trilogy before it comes out yeah you're getting the Mass Effect Trilogy this year this holiday 2015 on PS4, Xbox One, PC exactly. Mass Effect 4 next year 2016 probably same holiday time period okay I'm gonna go back to Bethesda for one more guess and it's similar to one of the ones Greg made uh Doom is shown for about 15 or 20 minutes I'm very excited about June 4 um and they announced the beta is live now for uh for people that have um that bought Wolfenstein yeah okay at the Ubisoft conference the best trailer shown is a Ubi Art engine game similar to Valiant Hearts when that got displayed but what can",

They'll announce it and they'll say like we have a movie-like an episode seven tying game, and then we have Battlefront, and they're two separate games, and they both come out this fall, um. And the reason that they're going to talk about this late and they kind of do this after... it's probably not going to be very good, yeah, um. But it seems like a wasted opportunity, and almost impossible to fathom that they are not going to have an episode seven game, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. And so you kind of have to announce it soon. I hope it's at least as good as the episode one game on PS1. I never played that, and I'm sure it was not good, but I played the **** out of it.

So whether or not you're surprised by them, I guess is up to the beholder. Beyond Good & Evil 2 seems like a safe bet because that has been rumored for so long, but I don't - I just don't think that anyone, I just, that seems like a weird game to make. You be soft's weird are, but Beyond Good & Evil came out like 11 or 12 years ago now, so I had it and I liked it. I had it on Xbox actually, um, but is now really the time to go back to that?

And then there's the um people that love Legends, that I think are a couple years older than me. And then there's guys a couple years older than that, like you, that're OG, you know? But everyone has their own generation of Mega Man. I think Mega Man is one of the few franchises that has it's kind of like Mario where it's kind of unfair to hate on Mario games cuz there's so many different types of Mario games and just cuz Mario's in the title it's not one thing.
