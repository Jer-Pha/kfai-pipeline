Yes, you never play video games; you hate video games. Very seldom do I play video games. I don't hate video games, but you love Batman. I do love Batman. You've been playing Batman: Arkham Knight. Look at him! Look at him! Love her? Batman this guy... Oh no, I said it. He's possessed. You hearing all this? Do me a favor, Kevin, shut the door, 'cause we need to be able to talk about what we've done and seen in this game. Spoilers will be had. I assume yes, we're of course going to... you can leave too; just go. We can uh, we if this is going live, I don't know when Tim's putting it live. We're filming a spoiler cast thing, you know, our whole our thoughts, our review discussion. I'm excited about that. So by the time that when that goes live, that'll be further in the future; that'll actually have been we've played more of the game. How far are you in?\"",

He says at the end of it (spoilers), that he's actually testing the Batmobile and getting all sorts of data as to what your new toy is so he can come after you. I fell right into his hands, right?

Yeah, but hard's not that bad. Hard just takes away their reversals. I'm not very good. I really enjoyed Arkham City on hard, and I don't play games on hard really. Yeah, and there's also no boss battles in this version. That was a big part of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City. You build up to fight somebody; you have to do something, and they're really isn't really yeah.
