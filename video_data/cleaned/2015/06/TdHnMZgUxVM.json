But I'd put that for sure possibly the top of the list, but it's somewhere in there. Bold yeah bold. Now another thing that I think is easy to say is Super Smash Bros. Melee. I braw on my list. Melee is the one that everybody would love to say and everyone's favorite, and like it's more competitive and all that stuff. And I have amazing memories playing melee. That was uh the first GameCube game that I had. I had the GameCube before it came out because it was coming out two weeks later which I'll never understand. But I remember just sitting there with the GameCube waiting to play this game holding the controller imagining playing Smash Bros and just the day it happened I was like oh my God who are these Mario people I don't know what's happening but it was so good um and going back from that",

Melee to come and just blow it out 25 characters it's like Super Smash Bros. Melee was well I never played melee that I mean you missed out I know I had a bunch of friends that did and it was one of again it was one of those experiences where they had been playing for like three or four months before I got my hands on the controller and then it was done I was like I can't win this game these guys are kicking the **** out of me I mean Super Smash Bros. Melee really took smash to another level like it took it to be hyper competitive I mean Super Smash Bros. 64 was competitive especially like in a bedroom setting of just like I'm playing with my friends like we all got super competitive and",

But then when Brawl came out it was kind of like this really nice like cross-generational thing - it was his friends, my friends, like all these different people playing this game because we'd grown up with 64, we'd grown up with Melee, and Brawl was kind of just that like next level thing of just we're going to adults, all of us adults, let's play this game. And man, we would just get so into it. It's like none of us were good to the point of being able to say oh I like Melee better because it's faster and all that stuff.

It's just like, just because it's the first doesn't make it the best. Super Mario Brothers 1 is amazing, it is not better than three, it is not better than World. Like that's not even you can't say that. Does it get points for being the first? It does; you got to give it the credit, but it's like anybody that says Super Mario Bros is their favorite game, I question that.
