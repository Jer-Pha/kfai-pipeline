I'm doing this, I'm turning towards... I'm just giving you the angle. This is what Colin always complains about. Pell is here too; he brought a rose to pay his respects. You know why I like this? Because it's his way of saying that he really liked Batman Forever, which the theme song was there. It is. Buddy, give it to me okay. Batman: Arkham Knight - heads up everybody, this is the review discussion where we just spoil the hell out of the game. So if you haven't beaten the game or you don't want spoilers, this is your chance to click off right now and get out and not have to yell at us in the comments okay cool. What did you think of Batman: Arkham Knight? I loved it yeah I loved it everything about it.

Um, and that's like the scene on the wall, yeah, and you see the scene of the Joker coming through and shooting, from The Killing Joke, yeah, he comes in changed his outfit which is weird but I guess we'll see more of that probably in the Batgirl DLC if you ask me, is that it? I think so. Oh, I think that'll be like her final night as Batgirl and then it'll end and transition into that scene. She gotcha okay um so there were there",

I like the story a lot. I enjoyed how they did all the Joker stuff. I enjoyed the way they incorporated him. I thought, \"I knew like once they did Arkham Origins and it was still a Joker story, I was like you're going to tell me three out of four games aren't going to be about the Joker clearly this is going to have the Joker even though he's really dead and... da d da... and we burned him in the trailer to make sure you knew he was dead.

I they spun remember they well it doesn't matter it you're right it wouldn't it doesn't make a look of sense. Doesn't make a look of sense but guess what it still does not overshadow that amazing ending where he's like \"where Gordon's like kid like why is he running?\" He didn't do anything, he has to cuz he's the hero, you know? He's our watchful Guardian, he's our Dark Knight, and he's going up that tube and it's done. I'm like \"that was worth it,\" that was worth all of it, and that's what you get with this game right where you're like sure it is a... you know I don't know how long did you play it for? Guess storywise the whole thing so far oh so far oh Jesus so far I I it's depressing to think you figure like what probably 12 hours this weekend alone just doing weird side **** and then it was like four nights a lot so yeah like 30 plus 40 probably I'm",

That's my thing, that's what I'm and that that should speak to how much I like the game even though I may be negative about it when I talk about it is that I can't wait to do the Riddler challenges to dedicate myself to the AR **** to knock off the little side thing trophies that I don't know exactly how to get yet, like you know Glide across the water, I haven't even started trying maybe it's easy but I'm just going to look at a guide and see what they\"",

One thing before we go is like I want to talk, I want to give a shout out to the Riddler trophies themselves. I remember Riddler trophies in Arkham City; I was like, \"I'm going to try to get these,\" and I played for like maybe an hour, I was like, \"This is not fun.\" I'm having a ball with all the Riddler trophies - lots of them. First off, a lot of them are just out in plain sight, it's kind of that rewarding thing of like, \"I can't believe they hid this in plain sight,\" like I've driven around the city for 12 hours, 16 hours, and I've never seen this or but then the ones that are there, like so far, I'm not getting the one that's like this **** all right hit this pod and then hit this thing and then do the like run and try to but do it all with the line launcher and ****",
