Melee also known from this game called Fire Emblem but whatever I know him from Smash Bros. Melee also in Fire Emblem 7 not my favorite of the Fire Emblem games he was my main character in Melee uh Roy Roy interesting see I never played Melee that was my problem uh now I need to go uh jump up my character here we pop out and do that yeah yeah we can do that cool so as you this is my Wii U ever played on Wii that I'm normally used to playing these are not the droids these are not you're looking for all right so so Nick um here you go you go up to the controls I let you do this so for everybody out there",

He still still is, but uh in Melee oh god, oh in Melee he uh he was way slower but he was more powerful and uh his sword did more damage if you hit it in the middle of the sword. Mar was the tip um I'm not sure if that's still how it is in this game. I'm going to assume but because this game is a lot slower than Melee, I don't think that Roy's at such a disadvantage with the speed that kick sucks. Oh this counter is still pretty yeah I know your counter is whatever it is good for your counter oh no no no think it's the same voice too are we going to get Ken ever?
