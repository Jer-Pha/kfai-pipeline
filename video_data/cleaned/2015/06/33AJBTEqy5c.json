You can get all the channels without the bundle; we'll see how that works cuz if Apple couldn't figure it out I'm not so convinced that PlayStation will want to do it then pretty big deal Call of Duty first one Sony thing then they said that the new home of Call of Duty is now PlayStation, so shots fired. Then Star Wars music started playing and it was a cheat pop and everyone got excited but it was for Disney Infinity 3.0 which is cool and they showed a bunch of stuff so there's your kid Star Wars game Colin it's Infinity which is what they're doing there's all the toys",

I'm not surprised that it was there, but I'm definitely surprised that they let off with it and I like that they just got it right out of the way. I think it makes perfect sense; they've made us wait long enough for that game. Like you want to talk about the cheers Shawn Layden got when he came out there and said this is something people have been waiting for, this is the place where it started going nuts because everyone knew what came next, and to come out there and have his name pop up, you know what I mean, have it look like the old game we had been saying that it's going to look a lot different, it's going to be that looked how I remembered.

I think that's important too because you know we were expecting uh something radically different in the fact that they gave us exactly the game that we've been waiting for like this looks like very similar demo to the one that we saw a long time ago and like some people can complain about that but I think that's that's silly it's like it, this is what we were waiting for, this is what we want if we were to see something totally new it'd be a different game you know but I I mean it had gone through so many iterations so many different things had happened you know what I mean I think that's what we",

There were bigger rumors that they were fired, um, and then brought back as consultants basically being, you know, kind of like a punishment. Who the hell really knows what happens? But that showed to me like for Square Enix and Studio Japan to say like everything's cool with us, and um, he's still working on the game, and the visionary, the man who you think is making the game is making the game because a lot of the rumors recently were about Mark Cerny, and we've heard this from many people that Mark Cerny is really the one finishing the game now, um, who of course is responsible for games like Crash Bandicoot, but uh it seems like Uehara is still intimately involved, that was a big symbol for people that",

It was also big that Yuji Naka was in the crowd, went to him and they talked to him for or they you know talked about him for a minute. I love that on your notes it just says \"wow\" next to it - there's a little bracket. Wow. This conference had a couple of moments that reminded me a lot of the PlayStation Experience panel when they showed Uncharted 4 the first time and Colin kept going, \"You're seeing this!\" and elbowing me in the ribs but you were you were off-kilter so you just kept turning around and saying things to me instead of physically poking me.

I'm excited about everything that the way it sounds and and the fact that there's just seemingly infinite amount of stars, and the comment that he said that got me really excited was \"There are gonna be stars that no one ever visits and planets that no one ever visits.\" Like, no matter how much you play the game.

I got two-thirds of that right: Project Morpheus was shown for 20 minutes or less was my guess and I got that right. Price drop: PS4 and Vita both get price drops, I got that wrong.
