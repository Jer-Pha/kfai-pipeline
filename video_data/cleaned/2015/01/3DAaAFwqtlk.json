See that's the skill - is that you when you get hit, you might as well just embrace it. Yeah, exactly. Now you can't get through that area because you don't have the Crash Bombs yet from Mega Man so you have to course so you're taking it kind of a labyrinth and you you're back where you kind of started which is fine. Yeah, it's okay. You know there's no timer here. There's no real rush this is weird. I want to shoot up but I can't shoot up. Can't shoot down. Can't duck. Oh, but I can slip and slide my way to victory. Oh, those lemons were going rad all right. So we're good. We're hanging in there. Extra lives are up there. You can't get it.

He'll stop time and he'll try to run into you in a flash so that's where Flash comes from, and then he'll freeze you and shoot. Oh, he froze me! But the thing is that he does the most damage when he runs into you, so he's going to just constantly chase you. So I just need to run from him and just pepper him, just pepper him. Yeah, lemon pepper. I believe in you; I believe too. Yeah, you're good; you're good. Yeah, you're real good! What? Oh, I'm frozen! I thought it was some crazy slow down. No, just hit him one more time; hit him one more time. He's dead. Got him! Yes, beat Flash Man that's it. I just did it. I just beat a Mega Man 2 boss, that's perfect. You all saw it happen.

I would say my favorite song is Metal Man; Metal Man's metal man is the best place to start the game because his weapon is the most useful. So I think that A Fine Place to Go is yeah, let's go there, man. About to get rocked. I'm impressed with Tim; you know Tim can play. Tim can play the game great. I like old games; I like them a lot. I like jumping and shooting. I always love Metal Man because his sprite looks like he's a doctor; looks like he has one of those little light things, yeah. Like one of those little light things. Okay, see this reminds me of Mario 2o the last couple levels of it you want to grab that, yeah. Definitely if you jump and go over, like it'll let you move quick okay. What does that tank do?

So yeah, quickly no, no those things do a lot of damage so you're going to want to just be patient there you go and watch this one's going the other way so all right damn it. And actually, it's good that we have Flash B's weapon because as part of this stage, that you can totally skip with it, that you don't have. So how do I like choose weapons? You press start and then you go up and down, so like B is Bubble Lead if you go up. How are people supposed to know this well presumably you don't need to use that but I mean if you want to shoot, you see what it is, it's fine definitely.

Oh man, he's really do metal man stage is a stage of patience; yeah I don't got much of that and the flicker here is just incredible; I love it. What I guess it did hit me; I can't even pretend it all right now by the rule; I guess yeah that's it cuz remember you lost a life on Flash Man, you died and then you lost your other two lives on Metal Man. Oh did I just lose two lives there; that's crazy. All right now by rule of this arbitrary game I've created about Mega Man 2 I must now be the stage uh and hopefully I don't screw it up; you know you never know I screw up every once in a while. The thing is that when I die in Mega Man I just restart the game cuz it bothers me so we'll",

I guess it didn't say. Um, oh I guess you have to get through the stage. I guess that makes sense. So Metal Man's stage is all about you know, it's all about feel, and he's one of the two places I always start with his weapon, the metal blade. It's arguably not, arguably it is, the most useful and overpowered weapon in any Mega Man game ever; it's insane how it's the weakness of like four different robots and a bunch of different sub-enemies on different stages. So how would you have ever known to start on the bottom left guy in The Brady Bunch Square? I don't know; I mean, it's just something you figure out.

I mean, a lot of them, I mean, a lot of them from the first run are Elec Man to MM, yeah... um Electro knockoff; that was scary the way these guys move freaks me out. I just don't even like it. So we're here in Metal Man's stage. I'm going to show you and I'm going to show you something really cool about Metal Man. A lot of people don't know there are two cool things about Metal Man. One, I can't show you now; one I will show you. The one thing is that you can kill Metal Man with his own weapon in one hit. You can do that in Wily's Castle. The other thing is that he will not attack you if you don't attack him. Oh really? He just hangs out, like once you start jumping. So basically, you want to",
