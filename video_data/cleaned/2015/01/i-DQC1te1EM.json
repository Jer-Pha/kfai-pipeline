Tim, what are the comments saying? Everyone's like, \"Oh, you guys are choosing the same characters.\" Not me, by the way. I switch it up every time. You're changing. You just stick your mic in your thing. What? You keep talking. I'm talking about a lot of stuff. People are upset that we're just playing the Omega stages. Not too many. I think most people are okay with that. Um, but today we're going crazy. We're gonna go crazy. And they're mad that we're playing just four player matches. So, we're all going to go random.
