What's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So thanks for your support over on Patreon.com Kinda Funny. We're back for one final season where I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, throw it at him, and then we talk it out. I got a lot of pent-up anger, a lot of pent-up throws in me if you like that, like the video, subscribe to us here on YouTube, share us with your friends, support us on Patreon.com Kinda Funny. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is Nintendo, submitted by Reggie NOA. Nintendo, Nintendo, Nintendo. Where do you want to start with this giant topic of Nintendo?

It's like Genesis was this secondary machine, this machine that had some good games on it, but Super Nintendo just trounced it. There's been really few examples - that's a good definition, that's not a joke - that's a good definition of the Genesis. It was a pretty subpar console compared to its competition. I'm sorry to tell you, okay? Um, but as time has gone on, Nintendo has become this company that has done nothing but disappoint me, right? Um, and I was thinking about Smash Bros., that just came out on Wii U; it's a great game, it's a lot of fun, really, really great game. We love playing it, but it's very indicative of what Nintendo is - it's a fighting game based on a fighting game that came out on the N64 with characters none of which are really you know new except for maybe that guy from Xenoblade yeah and it's played with",

There was a whole huge quality control thing, which was, you know, a relic of trying to fix what happened with Atari, which was, you know, a lack of quality. And the SNES had extraordinary third-party support, um, both exclusives and, and you know, obviously. But that's how far you have to look back then. You jump to N64, and it all goes to hell because that's when they started making really weird decisions, and the weird decisions just never stopped, you know. And that's kind of where they are right now. Now, the N64 was a great console; that was my secondary console. I mean, I was a PlayStation guy at that point. I had my N64 for the Zelda games, you know? I loved weird games like Hybrid Heaven, the wrestling games \u2013 played 'em, didn't play the wrestling games, but what's up with... you know, you know?

Now that obviously that controller wouldn't have worked today, yeah, um, so that was a weird console. I actually adored the GameCube; like I liked N64 but I actually adored the GameCube; like I, I had a ton of GameCube games and really, really liked playing it. But you had a lot of great Nintendo exclusive GameCube games, yeah, there were, and there were third-party games on it, like Resident Evil 4 and Beyond Good & Evil, you know, like there were big games on it; now those came to other consoles eventually, even though they totally lied.

When we went to the next generation, I was a poor college kid again, and uh, I wanted a Wii. I couldn't find one; I was a senior in college. I finally got one when I moved to San Francisco, and like, in the summer of 2007. Um, and I bought everything on the Wii, you know?

You're like, no, I'm playing this Virtual Console game on a Wii, what are you talking about? And uh, you know.

And really, we were talking about Genesis versus SNES, like Mario World versus Sonic - that's a joke, that's a **** joke, you know what I mean? Like 100% - when you consider the quality of those games and what those games are. And it's distressing to me that they just don't get it anymore. But the market gets it, and that's the big thing. Like PS4 is already outsold Wii U; Wii U had a year head start, and two of its three big games are already out.

So they need to make a powerful piece of hardware that developers want to make games for. They should get a bunch of third parties under contract and use some, like they did with Team Ninja and Metroid, to try to get a lot of third-party teams to experiment with their own IP and see what they can come up with.

The PlayStation was supposed to be a Nintendo 64 add-on, as a lot of people know, and there's bad blood there. I think it would be more likely actually that Nintendo would get into bed with Microsoft, but that's for another time. But I don't want that to happen - the best Nintendo is when they're innovating with games and making good hardware that people want to put games on. If you look at NES and SNES, those weren't unconventional, they were just awesome.
