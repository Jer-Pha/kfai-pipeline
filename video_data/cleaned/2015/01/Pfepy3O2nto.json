Hey, I'm just saying there was one victory before, and I think that was pretty clear, and then you go from there. That's what happens. It's so intense; I don't even want to talk about it. I know, I know, but we love each other so much it's so hard not being able to talk to you because that's all I do all day long every day, and I make a living at it somehow. Oh damn, oh see, I wasn't doing my single lines here at the beginning; I was trying to go for the Tetris, I was trying to get the big punches like you were. I don't know if it worked or helped or hurt. Oh doctor, I should, I should yeah. Tetris is where it's at, remember that song? \"I got two turntables and a microphone.\" Let's do this.
