So a lot of things were announced today, I wouldn't say anything too revolutionary, um, shocking, no, exactly. But this was a we all knew this was going to be a new 3DS-focused direct, and we got a lot about that, including a release date, February 13th, which is pretty soon, yeah.

The fact that this isn't a Majora's Mask special edition of the original DS, we should be happy about that - true, that's a good thing. So I'm pretty yeah it it looks cool okay now the other thing that it has is it has the NFC for amiibos right so we're going to get an update for Smash Bros so that we can use the amiibos on the new 3DS not on the the 3DS here's your chance to buy it yeah exactly here's your chance to upgrade, not be mad about your PO brick eventually there's going to be a little adapter for the older 3DSs but I there's no there was no news of that today we'll see um they announced wave four of the Smash Bros amiibos which",

I'm assuming it will no, actually it will. If you would have asked me last night, will the new 3DS come with a charging cable? I would have said yeah of course. I would have assumed that this whole thing they kind of learning learning as we go and again I don't have all the facts on this this is this is all breaking news Nintendo's really good at giving out peace mail information like when they revealed a new console and only showed the controller and no one knew what the **** was happening, is this a",

Okay, so I think that's okay. I'm not I'm not too upset. F I'm sure collectors will like that. Yeah, um they also talked about amiibo functionality and Kirby and the Rainbow Curse and Captain Toad and stuff like that.

Cool, good for them. I mean, that's the interesting thing we always talk about with Nintendo right? You buy that console for the first-party games and the exclusives and everything you want right?

So let us know what you think about it. We're trying to do something different than the Game Over Greggy show, which is each of us bring a topic. This is more just looking at the news and then trying to divide it up into four topics. What I want to try today is the last topic being a bunch of little little tidbits of news. So we're gonna start off with news that I really care about. You know what? Let's just call let's just call this section \"The News I Care About.\" The News Tim Cares About timing, yes. Kingdom Hearts 3 coming in 2015 according to Goofy. No way there's no way in hell that game's coming out this year.

So that's the thing we've talked about this on the show two weeks ago when we were talking about the games we're excited for in 2015 and I named this game because you know they're pretending it's going to come out this year, oh they're pretending good they're doing a good pretend game here. Yeah exactly and I I don't think it's going to happen but it's crazy that they would let this happen where they somehow let a voice actor say this stuff. That's the problem is you can't revoice actors in you have so much going on with that game, let alone a language barrier, let alone by the time you get out to these voice actors I totally get that what a it's like what who said what yeah all right they don't I mean they're not what am I allowed to say what am I not allowed say yeah and that's why like when we were talking to Troy yesterday on the you know Colin Greg live and then the Game Over Greggy show.",

People seem way more eager for Kingdom Hearts 3 than Final Fantasy 15. Um, Final Fantasy XV was not as welcome lately, putting out all these games and not the games people want. Kingdom Hearts has been in limited supply so people are still into it. Well, no, it's the same thing with Kingdom Hearts; they're putting out all these games and they're not the ones people want. Yeah, but the core core Kingdom Hearts games are the ones people want - those 3DS or DS games, even you know, like 365 over two days, whatever they're just trying to come up with as many different ways to not call it three as humanly possible.

And that's the weirdest thing - I remember back in the day, arcades were a big deal; that was the experience, that was the marquee experience. It's like what I'm always talking about with movies - they'll be around; it'll just be different experiences. There exactly, and it's you know especially there was in the early 90s, arcades were huge, and then they kind of dipped off a bit, but then there was like a resurgence with the peripherals with Dance Dance Revolution, Time Crisis, um... the skateboarding game - we actually stood on the skateboard.
