I think the game's gorgeous, and it gives you a landscape to explore that I think is just begging for you to run out there and not even like just not even pay attention to your quests. Like any good open world, you start with the tutorial stage of course, but the way the game starts - I don't want to spoil it for anyone - it's probably one of the best openings ever, not counting the opening cinematic. I'm talking about the actual opening that leads into a tutorial, which if you think hard, you know what I'm talking about. Then you come out onto the balcony and it shows you a nice panoramic view of the world you're about to embark upon. So, what are your next thoughts? There's obviously a robust combat system in this game - you get a little taste of it when you go out there. I didn't get as far as you in the game because I think you played for a little longer than I did. Um, but tell me.",

And yeah, I saw a Griffin still - a dude's horse. Yeah, messed up. A guy's horse while some cowardly merchant hit under his carriage. I don't really blame my guess maybe I would be the Cowardly Merchant in that situation. You never really know. You like to think that you're going to be the hero but let's be perfectly honest it's so much easier just to hide under your own cart watch your horse be eaten absolutely and actually, that particular situation showed off I think nicely the conversation system in The Witcher 3 and also how that affects things for instance when you encounter that Griffin eating the dude's horse you can be nice to him and refuse payment because obviously witchers are basically bounty hunters.",

If it weren't for Tim Gettys coming over and saying, \"Dude, we got to go,\" I probably would have kept playing for at least a couple more hours. Yeah, definitely. And interesting what was cool too is just visually the way the sun really shone and illuminated various objects in the sky as the day-night cycle kind of took over because the day-night cycle seems like it's about a minute every four or five seconds, so the days actually go pretty slow, and it allows you I think to explore the world in a more meaningful way. So when you start and really gain control outside of the opening tutorial at dusk, it really does feel and look like dusk, and I think that's really cool. And as the day progressed and I went to the pub to get some information on our lady, then ran into those guys, I beat the **** out of uh, then you know everything in other words the world constantly looks different based solely on really basic things like a really",

I never played the other Witcher games, and by all accounts from people who are fans of the series, they're really excited about this one too. Yeah, yeah, I mean obviously we just scratched the surface of The Witcher 3; there's probably many more hours to come of goodness from that game. Colin, thanks so much for hanging out with me today. Final question for you: do you think we can get these chairs and these furs back to the studio without being noticed? I think we well, we can. Let me let me answer that question in two different ways. Can we get the chairs back to the studio and the fine pelts here? Uh, yes, can we do it?",
