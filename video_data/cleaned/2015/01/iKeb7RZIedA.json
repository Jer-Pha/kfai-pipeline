Who's this dude with the freaking spikes and it looks amazing. Anyway, long story short, I'm stoked. It got me back in; it got me right back into the game. Yeah, dude, it... it impressed the hell out of me. Like when it first started, I was like, \"I don't know about this.\" I'm talking like the first couple seconds - we just see the dude jump up so little weird. The first like 5 Seconds were just sand. Yeah, you just see sand for a second and the sand sold me because instantly I had so much thought going into this.

I love that we just got those little like flashes of every little tiny thing we needed: we got droids, we got the X-wings, we got the TIE fighters. So do you remember when The Dark Knight came out? Yeah, and they did that awesome trailer where it was just the Bat symbol coming toward you and breaking apart as you heard Michael Caine's voice - \"He's some people don't want to, don't want anything, they just want to watch the world burn.\" Yeah, that's what I was expecting.

I was excited for the movie; I was excited for this movie. And now I am [Y], and I saw it in IMAX, and I was like, \"Holy crap, there are stars everywhere.\" Just it just goes to show you the power of the trailer, right? Like, there's so many trailers that come out these days, it almost seems like making a movie is way easier than it used to be. And I say that, of course, with the grain of salt that it's not; it's super hard. But you see all these trailers for all these Marvel movies, even the Avengers 2 trailer, and you watch like that's cool; it's still missing a little bit of heart to some degree.

It's just there's a nostalgia that this one had that Attack of the Clones didn't have. Yeah, this... the soccer ball thing about the practical effects is crazy to me. It's like every single shot in this trailer had a purpose, had a very specific purpose: \"Hey, look we have this for you\" and \"we have this for you.\" And when you first saw the droid, everyone thought it was CG, and then recently it was revealed that... I think Mark Hamill said that yeah, Mark Ham said it was a physical circus. It's like that's but like that's crazy multifaceted.

It would be if she was younger and isn't with Luke but just the character is still it would be it would be interesting, it be hard, it be cool. And so that's my one, that's one hope, and my other hope is that they start revisiting some like I want them to go back to some of the planets from the prequels, just be like especially Coruscant, like going to Coruscant there's no way because my dad asked a question he was like you know how he's like what how do they he's like I guess I never thought about after the second Death Star was exploded that the Empire still exists, yeah, and I was like yeah because",

I hope that plays really prominently and I hope that they give it a better vision than that weird Blade Runner rip-off **that** they did in in the... You know, here's what I like about the concept of using practical effects: they're technically harder; they take longer to do, like they actually take longer to film if you're going to do a big set with practical effects.
