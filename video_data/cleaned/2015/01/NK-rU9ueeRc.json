Don't do that; that'll actually not get you the record, will actually get you arrested, I think. I think oh yeah, animal cruelty - nobody wants that.

I want to ask you about about you know we only have you for a very limited amount of time and and I'm yeah like I'm the only musician other musician at this table so I have to ask you a simple two questions: did you a what did you obviously you're vocalist and you play guitar? Did you do any other any other instruments on the record, and did you guys play live or did you do track by track and mix it that way? Um most of the stuff like all the Rhythm sections um were done live. Every song was done with bass drums and guitar being done at the same time. Sometimes bass drums, guitar, and keys.

And we wanted to record a six-track demo. We ended up doing that. But I play drums, and I remember we wanted to do everything on individual tracks so we can really tweak it and master it properly. And I remember being so frustrated because I couldn't play without everyone around me. I'm like, \"I can't do this.\" You have your headphones on; you have to click and stuff like that. I'm like, \"I can't do it.\" We ended up throwing in the towel on most of the songs and just playing live. And we lost the ability to master it, so we lost some of the fidelity and the sound.
