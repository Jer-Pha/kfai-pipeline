I'll admit there was a time when we took a walk into the dark, pitch-dark for like a mile and I had to go to this lake. I've never it's never been that dark in my entire life and I've never seen stars like this ever. Look down there, it was um it was unbelievable. But and that was real happiness. I was just sitting on a rock drinking beers I'd buy this late so it's like but that's not always gonna make me happy. Sometimes being alone makes you happy. Sometimes listening to a good song makes me happier here.

So, I mean, the way that I think, look kind of what I discovered through just what I've done is, I think, there's a couple things that are really important. The first one is to be a selfish son of a gun - which let me just break it down - is just that's kind of a weird way of putting it, but just to pursue what you want, you have to know what you want, yeah, yeah, you have to go after and get it exactly like an example of you guys is IGN, and you were good there, you had a great career, but you knew that you wanted to do something else, so you could have stayed at IGN, but you decided to do the selfish thing and pursue your own business to do your own thing. And I think pretty much anyone would agree that people in this community, anyway, would say that this is a good move - like it helped them out, I'm sure people really like watching what you do here",

I'm sure people really like watching you do what you do here because you get to do it the way that you want to do it instead of doing it the way with under restraints, I guess. Sure, but yeah. And I just feel like being selfish gets a really negative connotation, but I feel like if you had a good moral compass, like a functioning moral compass, it's really not that bad if you're not going out of your way to step on other people to get what you want. It's fine; just find out what you want and pursue it. And it might be different for other people, but just know that I mean... I was gonna say it sounds very Objectivist, yeah, but with the context of countries like America, Great Britain, Australia, etc., we have the opportunity to do it, so you should just do it. It's pretty yeah, I'm Randy; I was gonna say it sounds very Objectivist, yeah, but with the context of countries like America, Great Britain, Australia, etc., we have the opportunity to do it, so you should just do it.",

Would you like to pursue I'll walk up the exact definition for you buddy well it's that it's not quite there because like her okay Colin don't put yourself on this one we have Kevin over there for sure. I just make sure Tim is waking up, objectivism for Tom, I got right now he just shook his head at me no anyway so it's not like it's he's being selfish out over there give him some credit. It makes some people happy. Is this stupid Google watch couldn't even say hey Google define objective? Is it is excessive so here it says objectivism central tenets or that reality exists independently of consciousness, the human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic.",

Like everyone has everything that they want, and it's just kind of up to you to figure that out. Well, yeah, but that's also we'll take a step back because what you're talking about those two examples that you just used one could argue that you're creating a charity to help other people because that makes you happy seeing those people not dying on the streets makes you happy, right?

What people like no no you start charity, you started charity to help other people because it's selfless, but can it be selfless if it were miserable? There are examples of selfless people, Mother Teresa, Gandhi, like that's why we respect these people. Did you know Mother Teresa derived an insane amount of fulfillment from helping other people? No, I really think she was so super pious and I think that that like was one of the things that drove her, she wasn't doing it to update her status or anything, or help bring those people just a little bit better off in life isn't there something that you use, take a step inside feels",

That's actually a good argument because something really terrible happened recently, and it's terrible in quotes because I mean it's based on how you look at it. We're a hedge fund acquired an HIV drug, and then the price increased by 5500 percent because they need to make money on it. My argument is like my $76 pill now costs $750, yes, something I mean maybe more than that, yeah.

So there's this offset - we offset the research and development cost exactly by the time it gets over there, then we can sell them for much less. Something like we have four point four percent of the amount of the population in the world; we pay 40% of the world's costs for help for medicine. And most of the profit from the pharmaceutical companies comes from Americans - so this argument about whether it's right or wrong is a tough one, because the medicine wouldn't exist if there was no profit motivation to make it in the first place.

It's a lot of money is you have to do clinical trial to clinical trial to make sure it works because hey you don't want to give and put a drug into the world that kills it doesn't work or kills people or has bad side effects. It has bad side effects. And B they take that money and then they were able to quote-unquote research and develop other pills for other for the other ailments. And then there's they also the opposite argument where they're like no one eats at the money and find the cure for it. And then of course the problem with that is there's no money to cure them, always say there's nobody to cure is only money and treatments right cuz if you care of something and it's gone like bull yeah we fix cancer that's yeah there's always been massive conspiracy theories about that - yeah with form so Komen said I don't like I'm not I'm not even I'm not gonna believe I don't know",
