I think that uh yeah, that's what turned me off to the shirt originally. Yeah, I like the shirt a lot. I would have loved it if it was like black and then white just white. Oh, just I would even love it with just the Japanese text and not the PlayStation logo. That's just to make it really obscure. Wow, yeah that be crazy. Like when they sent out... it says PlayStation. Remember when they had the rewards program? They sent out the rewards shirt that was in Japanese. That was like thank you for supporting PlayStation or it said PlayStation I forget but you don't read Japanese so you I read Japanese. I'm telling you, it has PlayStation. You don't read Japanese definitely, you barely read English definitely not remember uh years ago.",

You hit me up and said, \"Do I need anything from Sprouts?\" And I assumed it was a grocery store, but I wasn't sure. There's two different ones: there's one up in San Rafael or whatever that is, I go to with Cheryl sometimes; and then there's one in Daly City by The Habit, which is a great burger place - it's just obnoxious whenever there's a new place that opens up that's been everywhere else, everyone rushes it.

Let's start with the Battlefront beta. Colin, you played it half an hour? I call it a return to form for you in Let's Plays where you were funny, Nick was there, you guys were popping off each other, you're having a great time. Am I usually miserable and shitty on Let's Plays? No, you're very, very, very collegiate professor level. This was you having fun again. You took off the leather elbow patches and said, 'Let's play some.'

Like there's just a lot of like weird things you can do in the game. I didn't see any B-wings or Y-wings or anything like that, but... but like they're throwing things in there that don't make really a lot of sense. Like I'm a snow trooper then suddenly I'm flying a TIE fighter and no wonder I'm not flying it very confidently because I'm a snow trooper. Um, but I think it's fun. There's like... it's just it's beautiful. It ran well, I mean from what I was seeing it ran perfectly fine. Connection issues, uh, no, I had no connection issues. The load times were fine.

So it's like the the um... And I'm not saying that's going to happen; I'm saying that has happened in the past. Yeah, uh, no. This game's going to get server crush on this and load is going to be monumental. Um, and I'm I'm interested to see how they can handle it. It's not it's going to be like Call of Duty levels. Activation is used to that, though. I'm not sure that you know; I don't know that the exact sales numbers, but my assumption is that this will sell more than any Battlefield game.

Um, cuz I was kind of playing it just 'cause I was like, \"I want to get through this\" and whatever we did the let's play of it, but the let's play was kind of just the early on tutorial stage after that the game opens up a lot more. Um, um, it's it's definitely not open world, but it's like you can kind of explore the city a little bit and like you can go back to the arc and switch characters whenever you want so you can play through the game as whatever character you want whereas the tutorial bit we did was to introduce you to each of the the different characters.

I think two people liked two better than one. I just remember they fell off at one point. Yeah, um, but this it's different. This to me is what everyone remembers, Carto G. This is G1 completely. And it's they really kind of went out of their way to um give the fans what they would want from all the original voices of the living cast. Um, and it's set up like an episode of the old cartoon where when there's scene transitions it does the little like Autobot to Decepticon that like that whole thing. I'm like that's awesome yeah.

They're a triple-A game that are made with fewer than that, but if you go to Naughty Dog it's about that big, if you go to the team that works on Destiny is probably three times bigger than that, so it's like, so that's a pretty normal-sized Studio to make a game at a time maybe two games at a time.

Um, because you have to review it at the time it comes out at the price it's launched at, so that might change a perception later on. But that's the condition which you review the game. It's like we used to review the game without patches sometimes, and it's like this is the condition the games are in when they launch. Like the patch might come out in two weeks, but that's not the game the way it comes out of the box. And so I bring that up because I think it's relevant if Transformers is a good game at $50, but it might seem like a little bit of a ripoff. Does it become like a better game because it's $20? And I say like it doesn't change the game as it is, but it changes the cost-benefit analysis of playing it and buying it. And I think the economics are that somewhat relevant.

Rock Band is totally a party game and that's great and the people have a lot of fun with it but I think a big issue with it is a lot of the songs just aren't fun on one of the one or more of the instruments people are playing on and time right so a song that's fun to sing is super boring on guitar or even more boring on bass, drums are pretty consistent like C.U. drums are just the backbone to any song um but it's it's hard and especially when you have such a uh a focus on music you know these games completely run on music and without people caring about the music they're nothing like there's nothing there and",

Like what they really should have done is had a set list that's way bigger than 50 songs or whatever it is, and really give people bang for their buck. I mean, that's the music. I agree with you entirely with that because it's like The Devil's Advocate to that is the fact that like who cares about what the track list is if you don't like it just go buy the songs you like. You have to buy them. No, I know, and that that is an issue on top of already buying this, and I think a lot of the problems this game has are semantic stuff - why is it four?

And that was one of the things I've been asking leading into it with you guys if how much you knew about it, cuz if infamously, that was the one where like literally we were getting our review copies the next day and during what Raw or Monday Night Football or something they ran a Subway commercial with it, and they showed him falling out the back of the plane. And I was like, I had never thought about that; it had never dawned on me that we were going to exit the plane - we knew battle, but I never thought we wouldn't be on the plane. And like I thought that sequence even knowing that was so awesome. Subway Cup in his hand, yeah he did alright, and he's like yeah go to F Subway if he's fresh, and they did say that, but like, like that.",

So I think the exact ops that happen with two to three - two and three look very similar to each other because there's nowhere else to go from there.

Um, console launchers are always events; I don't think we have events like that anymore because I actually think that the volume of midnight releases and making something out of nothing is kind of happening too often. So um Halo 5 and the new Call of Duty are going to be big, big, big releases but they would have been more special, I think, years ago when it was more rare to go into a store at midnight or to have your digital download ready to go and it's already pre-loaded and all that kind of stuff. I think it's removed the like the excitement about having a game like Madden One um I think you've seen that go down with Madden as well; I think Madden back in the day there was they made Madden Day was something the fans made right, and then EA got on board with it but then yeah when it was you can preload everything and you don't have to.",

I'm curious what you guys think: how long does it take to really determine when you enjoy a game or not? Does it depend on the total length of the game, the genre, etc.? For me, it takes 3 to 7 hours depending on the genre. Thanks, interesting question. I feel like I don't even need to play it; I feel like honestly, it's like I know what I like and I know what I don't like, and I can kind of just... you know, watch some gameplay of it, see someone else play it, and I know if I'm going to enjoy it or not. In terms of stuff I know I'm going to like playing it, am I going to love it or not? I don't think it takes that long; I think it takes maybe an hour, not even... yeah, I think when you're playing it, you know pretty quick if I'm enjoying it if I'm having fun with it.
