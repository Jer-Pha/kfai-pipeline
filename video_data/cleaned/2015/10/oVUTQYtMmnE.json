            "text": "greetings and salutations welcome to Kinda Funny Games My name is Colin Moriarty now many of you out there might know that I'm a huge fan of the Tales series from Bandai Namco and our friends at Bandai Namco sent me a collector's edition of the brand new Tales game Tales of Zestiria and as you can see on the top I am 1st of 20,000 there's only 20,000 these in the world and so I thought I'd open them do a little unboxing for you in the style of a normal Kinda Funny unboxing which is to say a little bit silly and a little bit zany so the one thing I want to point out before I even unbox it is I like that Bandai Namco smart enough and cognizant enough to keep their Collector's Edition for the Tales games the same size so the Symphonia one for instance and the Xillia 2 one um they're all the same size you can put them on the Shelf next to each other I actually quite enjoy that and I appreciate that but let's open up the plastic and get this this box out see if we can do it just just",

We got okay, so this is similar to the ones they did for Tales of Symphonia uh Chibi Koncha Figure Set, limited edition. For Tales, it's Aria; nothing else really interesting on the box. You can see the little art there on the box. Let's just I'm going to just kind of bang this one open. I'm going bang it open. I don't really know what that means. No, I'm good. Thank you. And then I'll put them together for you. But basically they're just little Chibi figures; little Act figures. You got to put them together on their little stand. So we'll do that in a moment. We'll get it all out. Oh, it smells good. Oh, it reminds me the it reminds me of old Star Wars and G.I. Joe toys when you take them out of the bubble. Oh, that's a that's a nostalgic smell. Kevin, it's a very nostalgic smell. All right, there's more in here though we have a steel case for the game so you can do this. I've never been a huge fan of steel cases because I like the the normal look of all",
