We passed the baton and now you're just running. It's great. I want to talk a little bit about I want to revisit our our talk that we do every, you know, two three months about the current state of television specifically. You know when you have a wife which n of you have uh they sometimes like to do activities together. Now I know it is what it is but I do it one of the activities my wife likes to do is when it's Awards season she likes to sit and watch the awards. Now these Awards have not gotten any shorter in fact I don't have any science behind this and Kevin maybe you can verify this for me, you don't have to on this one actually I don't care uh they've got they seemingly have gotten longer and I watched the Emmy Awards yesterday, not a bad show but one of those things where you're like why do we need these ratings.",

Uh, walk uh Game of Thrones is still good but I don't like I missed for The Walking Dead last night, I'm like H I'm okay if I don't watch it for like another week or two, it doesn't really matter to me. I'm not addicted like I was to Lost or uh actually Lost - a perfect example the first two seasons of Lost I was like this is amazing like I'm in love with these characters and I'm like genuinely worried for their safety even though I'm a 26y old man who understands that this is a television show. I don't know are you guys addicted to anything right now, is there anything on the horizon that you like and I mean no crack Game of Thrones still I like that so did you would you",

What do you stop jumping tracks if we're talking about award shows, yeah? There's a whole bunch to say. All right, let's talk about award shows, okay. Yeah, they suck and they're stupid, okay. I mean like, topic over the point of it - the point of it, I think back in the day, and even with Oscars and all this other stuff is the fact that I think that they're there as uh method of discovery - this has won this award, you didn't know anything about it, and now yeah shows that are cleaning up and winning are shows you already know are great.

What one when I see them come through Amazon Prime or Netflix in 8 years I want to watch watch them. My thing with the with award shows, whether it's music stuff, music videos like VMAs or uh Emmys or Grammys or any of the stuff, it's like I I'm in it for very specific things.
