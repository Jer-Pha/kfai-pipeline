We've talked about music many times on the show, but usually in a more roundabout way or something else will be the topic and then we bring up music as an example, you know, like we didn't do this today, but we were talking about like what would you be buried with? We bring up the oh I'd be buried with this album because we've done topics that are like what's your favorite album of all time or whatever, like what music defines the 90s to you. This is different because a lot of people have been tweeting at me or like on the Facebook group and stuff, and they're like hey, like what music do you recommend listening to, like Kinda Funny? You should make a Spotify playlist or this or that. Well, that'd be fun; I don't use Spotify so I don't really do that but I will help Nick make one. I would love that. I mean, you two are the ones that know a lot about music, although Greg oddly enough can sing the lyrics to any **** song.",

Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, The Wall. You can't go wrong with that. Thankfully, you can also listen to Tears for Fears' Songs from the Big Chair. There's a lot of good music by them. Missing Persons has real life. These are good bands to listen to like New Wave, Stone Temple Pilots - Purple and Core 2. Great records, really seminal records.

De La Soul - you can't go wrong with anything from their catalog. But Stakes Is High as A Tribe Called Quest's Midnight Marauders is my favorite, but you again, you can't really go wrong with most of their catalogue either. Muse at Absolution - a **** really really really good record. Dredg - El Cielo is maybe my favorite record of all time and with exception of maybe Transistor by 311, Catch Without Arms is another good Dredg record.
