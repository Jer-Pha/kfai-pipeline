If you have a topic for us to read on this Gamescast, go to KindaFunny.com/GamescastTopic, leave it, leave a post and we'll get to it, just like we're going to with Matthew Clemens - but his name isn't spelled like that, it's M-A-T-H-Y-O-U-M-A-T. What no, it's Matthew, it's still Matthew, anyways. Do you think we get too many free games? If you're a subscriber to PlayStation Plus or Xbox Gold and have all the consoles, that's up to 10 free games a month. I love seeing new games and trying new games, I may not normally try but it adds to my backlog exponentially. What are your thoughts? Well, technically they're not free because you pay for them, you pay for your subscription service that then gets you that... but uh no, I mean for me the ones that come along on PlayStation Plus or Xbox Gold are totally just like 'oh cool' if I'm into that one, I'll get or download it, or you know, I usually redeem.\"",

It all stems from a simpler time I feel like when we started at IGN right - you literally could play everything, you know what I mean? Like digital downloads hadn't taken off, that wasn't a thing; the PSN and Xbox Live was just getting started and what was on there wasn't amazing, like Geometry Wars sure, Super Rub-a-Dub of course but I mean like there it was actually slow periods - I remember summers when there was nothing to play so I remember playing on my Wii uh",

And for five years ago I would have done it - all these races with all these cars and so like alright but now but now it's like you know what, I'll have like 80% of the trophies in that game, that's fine. I have 50 Platinum trophies, you know. I put in my time; my 50th platinum trophy was Shovel Knight and I and I I that was a hard one and I'm proud of that. So it's just the game but that was five months ago I was actually just looking recently like I haven't gotten a platinum in five months so it's it's you know it exists and it's there and the system is important and I care about those things, but um at the same time like it's not going to like ruin my life anymore.

Oh my God, so it wasn't like I didn't try; that was when the psychosis hit, like max level um but were you still 100% games 100% of the time? And that's what I'm trying to recapture with Mad Max is I'm doing I'm going through all the motions in that game and having a good time. I'm like this is the way I used to play games, but then I think about like Final Fantasy VII coming out, which is the re-release, and I'm like I'm platinuming that too. So it's just like... so it's just like and we already know what those trophies are because they'll be the same as the Steam achievements. So it's it's it's about identifying the games like Greg said that you like and putting the time in if you want, but they're there.

Um, so I don't know if you can call it a return to form. It would be like saying Tomb Raider was a return to form for Square Enix; that's not really a Square game, you know?

But I stand by the fact that just Kratos is such a dumb character; yeah, I think I mean I think God of War is style over substance, yeah.
