All Egyptians were buried with at least some goods that they thought were necessary after death. At a minimum, these consisted of everyday objects such as bowls, combs, and other trinkets along with food. Wealthier Egyptians could afford to be buried with jewelry, furniture, and other valuables which made them targets of tomb robbers in the early dynastic period tombs were filled with daily life objects such as furniture, jewelry, and other valuables.

I think about this a lot because I definitely pride myself on one of my passions being the music that I enjoy and I feel like I'm very knowledgeable about it, having said that, it's like I feel like I only really know very specific things and I don't know anything outside of that.
