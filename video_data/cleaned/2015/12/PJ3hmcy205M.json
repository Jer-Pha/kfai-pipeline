You know, early on Patreon, you can go over there on Kinda Funny Games Patreon.com of games and uh, you can get these episodes early or you can get them later for free on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames. But the problem there is then when we talk about what day does this episode come out, what EP, what Friday are we talking about - the early Friday or the later Friday? Yeah, now that's easier to handle when you're doing one at a time, but we're trying to gear up for the holidays so we're doing a couple episodes at a time out of order. We got all types of confused. So I celebrated episode 50, you got all types of confused. Hey GameOverGreggy, show wasn't perfect either, my friend. That's why we have to... did you do something? I put everything on the calendar and it made sense and then you went in there and messed it up.\"",

Um, but we didn't even explain what we did wrong, which was screwed up. We recorded episodes 50 and 51 already, and I made a big deal about it being episode 50, and then I teased what we're doing in episode 52. In each episode, we like don't forget in one week, in two weeks, this is happening. The first time I ever specifically call out like what's happening next week, and yeah, so then we're... So now this is the second-ever episode 49, which I like, yeah, duske. We might as well call it a final fantasy name, so it'll just be another episode of Kinda Funny Games Cast 49-2, nice.

Where it's like NX is coming; it's going to be out this fall. Smash Brothers is a launch title; it's a port; it has all the DLC, and they'll introduce a new character that'll be Mr. NX. I mean, I hope that happens. Um, I'm a little bit worried that he's saying this is it on this game. It's like, \"This is it.\" Maybe we do get the Game of the Year Definitive Edition or what the NX Edition? Yeah, M. Um, when the next comes and it is just all the DLC and all the stuff in one package, which at this point is a pretty hefty package.

Sure, um, so yeah, so that was the first announcement: there's another Fire Emblem character called Corrin from Fire Emblem Fates, that's not out in America, it's been out in Japan for a bit, um, and I'm excited; it's another sword character but it looks like it plays a little bit. Yeah, she is, it's a he or she, it's a he and a she, so it's uh, you see my confusing with these things, Greg, it's so it's a um, it's like an avatar character, so you get to choose and you decide if it's boy or girl in the beginning of the game; it's like Robin, I",

MH um so then the the the next thing was they really kind of uh went deeper into Cloud and they talked about him for a long time and really talk about his moves and all that stuff and how to use him and then they were like it's available later today it's like Nintendo the **** like that's such a ball drop to me where it's like have it available right now why are you doing like why say in a couple hours and like that's how long it gets the servers to go down I know but do it would leak they would have ruined it beforehand all these kids on",
