Let's start with the Vita. All right, okay. The only two games I have on the list that I could find are Danganronpa and Persona 4: Dancing All Night. Ah, yes. Did I miss anything? I mean, I have some games on my list, but nothing major here. No, nothing major. Uh, yeah, there weren't...there weren't many more games, yeah. Games were on PS3 as well. Well, the big thing is PC games that finally made their way over or whatever that's where it gets sticky, you know what I mean? But you're talking about like straight-up PlayStation or whatever it meant to you guys this year, like what did you play on it? Meant to me, oh okay, that's a different question. Uh, Danganronpa and Persona 4: Dancing All Night. Uh, I played it for 10 hours or so, it's still in my Vita, um, I mess with it every so often because I'm",

I mean, it's like that's what it's about. So um this game is like over the top um in in kind of the gore but the gore is like the blood's pink and stuff - it's not like you know scary in anyway. Um so I enjoyed it. Um but I have not seen enough to really like render a final verdict on it. I think people were a little lukewarm on it, it's just cuz it's not Danganronpa and we'll get more of that you know this coming year. The Bear is back, Monokuma, Monozukuri, Zuma's Revenge - you talking about like you know I'm looking through my trophies and like you want to talk about this was the year Vita I think fully did move into being the Indie station you know",

We talk about Vita, but before this trip to Chicago, I went on the store on my Vita and I was looking for something about I missed whatever, and it's this game where yeah, you play as a suicidal person or whatever, and like from their perspective, and it's like basically all text over a very 16-bit-looking you know out or whatever layout of the game or whatever.

I didn't I didn't want that; I wanted to play that game portably and uh you can't really do that with the the Wii U. You kind of can you play it on 3DS no I know but the 3DS I don't like the the buttons are too small, had same problem with Vita like it was the whole thing. But then I was like I want the the screen I have the OLED like I want I'm very particular when it comes to this stuff so I was very happy I played it on Vita and it definitely it made my Vita worth buying like I loved the **** out of that game.

Mega Man is like that too; it's a trial and error then you know the dragon comes. Yeah, but but they're they're different. This I think in that respect, this the game's design is a little different, whatever. But I I understand why people love those games.

And the other thing too is if it had been like a surprise later on that it's coming to Vita, maybe I would have played on PlayStation 4 and been able to adequately talk about it. But like when it sounded like all these games were coming out at the same time, oh great, no big deal. Same thing with Bastion, but I had played Bastion five years ago, so it didn't really matter. I can sit here and tell you Bastion's awesome. That said, that said, I just want to say Axiom Verge for what I played is excellent.

There's just not that many exclusives that you have to play on the console. There's not I mean I think Killzone's a fun game, a lot of people don't like it obviously Knack is forgettable, I think Second Son was a little disappointing although it's DLC I think was really great. Um Bloodborne and Until Dawn I think are really meaningful exclusives that people should play. The Uncharted collection is fun but when you really think back to PS3 and how poorly PS3 did out the gate yet it had MotorStorm and it had Resistance and it had Heavenly Sword and it had you know a bunch of games, folklore like there were games early on in the first 18 months that were pretty good and um it didn't matter so it really goes to show and I wonder what kind of information they're garnering at Sony about like do.",
