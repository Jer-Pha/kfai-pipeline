Because it's like, I don't ever want to cross that line of clickbait, and like, I'm getting people to click on sex, you know. But so then, like, love and sex, up example, yeah. I make the thumbnails for that, and I have rules of what I will put in the thumbnails and what I won't put into them, and I don't know where they exactly come from. And I think my internal struggle is the answer to this question: what it's like you know, obviously no nipples and no whatever, but it's too chief even more than that.

You know, and I'll try it like even if we're talking about stuff and in the content, like we can talk about **** and it's not bad but how to give a **** for some reason I question should I do that whereas how to get better at sex, I'm totally okay with saying what's the difference between that, how to give a **** on how to get better at sex, like why is one more graphic than the other. And that's where I kind of fall into it's like what are my rules, like why do I feel like the **** going too far but this law because **** is a term that's more of a slang term to where you would use that primarily it's looked at it, it's looked upon as",
