And I realized that that um I had great friends that really understood me, including the people sitting in this room, you know, so we would just meet. But, you know, whatever, you know, best friends and uh you know, because this is not something we've, you know, talked about with the audience or anything like that. just like something I had to deal with.

One of the parameters I identified is just like compassion, you know? Um, like understanding when a person needs to not be around for a while because they have other things to deal with. Um, and so you know that the breakup really reminded me that I have it pretty good with my friends and that I have a core group of people I can really lean on and rely on, including you guys. Um, I mean, definitely you guys more than anything maybe right now in my life. Um, but I just identified that yeah, that it's not just about laughs and camaraderie and all those kinds of things. It's that it's important, but it's about compassion. It's about loyalty. Like I'm a fiercely loyal friend, which I think that",

You're welcome. I just said that. I know. Uh and so loyalty is another thing that I really look for in like my friends. Like, you know, I don't I'm always I'm I really consider myself there for the people I care about. I'm I'm um you know, I might be like passive and and and stuff like that sometimes, but like when someone really needs me, um I'm there. So So that's another thing I identified. So anyway, I just wanted to open the floor up to you guys and see like what what are the parameters of friendship for you guys because I think it might be different for different people.

And it is that like compassion and honesty and loyalty. you know, I know that these three people I can really call on and rely upon for anything. Um, if I really need them, you know, I know that if I really needed Mike right now, he would come get on a plane and come here. If I really needed Ramon to be here, he would be here, you know.

Um, they do have these common themes that these check boxes that I like to to check with my friends, and that you know that you have someone in your life that you really care about. So I'm curious what you guys think about that. Yeah, for me it actually took leaving IGN to understand what friends meant to me, like what that word meant to me because you know like you were saying there are the different you know eras of your life. There's your childhood, there's your school, then there's your post-school. And with all of that, I've had a whole bunch of friends over the years and acquaintances and this and that.

But then there's people that come into your life and they don't have that time to kind of develop with you in the same way. Like you can't have those same experiences because you can't have class together. That's just not a thing we can do anymore in our life because that we're past that, you know? And I think a lot of those experiences kind of meld and form what uh friendship means to you because that's your entire life. Then you start getting just acquaintances and people you work with. It's like, oh, these are the people I hang out with every day. So, we're friends. We're having fun. And it's like, all right, so to be a friend, you need to have fun with them.

Or does that just equal people you're around? convenience. Convenience and all and Exactly. and and all that stuff and you're friendly with them. Yes, that's that's a really good way to put it. I've thought a lot about this lately. Yeah. And then you you think about like there's some good friends you can have that can kind of be there and they could be a good friend momentarily or even for a while. So, it's not necessarily that there's people that are just acquaintances, but it's like they were a friend from these years of my life.

Um but it really kind of made me realize that to me simplifying it to its most basic thing is my friends are the people that I want to eat dinner with. They're the people that I will hit up to get dinner with and to that constantly think I haven't eaten with this person in a while. It doesn't need to be dinner. It can be lunch. It could be whatever. But it's like for us when we go too long without getting like a group lunch, it stops feeling like friendship. It starts feeling more like IGN felt. Sure.

I haven't had dinner with Darren or whatever.\" Like these are people that I that they're my friends so I should eat with them because that is when we can catch up and actually talk and Yeah.

Like I I've you know, I struggled with a long time of like uh at IGN I always said we were always family, you know what I mean? And we are. And there's that the the family crest of IGN, you know what I mean? like you know it was so cool at the Game Awards this week to win my award and the next award Dunham won or Rocket League won. You know what I mean? So he came through with his award and it was like oh my god look at this. This is not the lives we thought we'd have eight years ago. You know what I mean?

I'm rolling through for work or whatever. You know what I mean? Like for me the best like I guess for me personally right now as I struggle with this definition and who's a real friend and who's just an acquaintance and how was it a matter of convenience for this that and the other the best example I can give is Scott Low and Cindy Tang, right? Is that like we when they lived in San Francisco Christine and I hung out with them all the time. Scott and I would go do stuff and it wasn't like I shouldn't say all the time right because we're super busy. So maybe I'm talking about we actually go and hang out and you know do this once or",

And when they moved to LA it was like a month later afterwards where it's like I really miss them. And as I went to text him he texted me the same thing and you're like that's what it's about. You know what I mean? And that's I think a similar thing with Dave Fenwick. You know what I mean? Like Dave and I have hung out in real life five six times. You know what I mean? But there was that bond where I remember that that Sunday morning. I was like, \"I'm Dave was awesome.\" And I he looked at my phone, he texted me, \"Hey man, just thinking of you in my backyard.\" But I was like, \"Oh, yeah.\" You know what I mean?

You meet these people and you do have that thing. And like you're saying, it's completely different adult friendship, right? You know what I mean? Like Dave Fenno and I didn't grow up together. You know what I mean? Like Po and I have hours and hours of stories from everything we ever did because we were together all the time. You know what I mean? Since eighth grade on or whatever and that we've known each other longer than that. But like that's real. You know what I mean?

Um and um there's that was the sign of friendship for me when some of the things Greg did for me in the fall. Um but it's it's uh you guys really are like my capital F friends, you know, after all that. I've known you guys for a long time, especially Nick and and um but we went through something that a lot of people can't understand together and it wasn't easy. It was really hard. It was the best decision we ever made, but we all had to convince each other over and over again that it was the best decision we ever made or that it was the right decision we were making and then we realized very quickly it was the best decision we could have possibly made. Um but there's something to that. It's I guess exper like experiential kind of stuff too is part of friendship as well. Um I met Raone because we both love 311.",

I would have never met Ramon if we didn't have that same musical experience of I walked by his dorm room and he was playing 311 on the guitar. Oh man, that's how I met him, you know. So, it's like serendipity. It's It's weird. There's weird stuff like that that sets precedence that then you're like, well, Ramon is like a brother to me and then isn't that weird that Ramon and Greg love each other? Isn't that strange? There's like something about all of us that's the same. Some weird commonality, some weird theme that we like Ramon and Greg love each other. It's weird.

And I I mean because I don't want to speak for you, Colin, but I'd like to give a special friend shout out and this is one is Clement. And you know what I mean like Clemens like I remember when he got laid off at IGN when that when that wave happened or whatever and was pissed off and I was devastated. I couldn't stop crying and it was like you at the moment I mean we've been through a lot of layoffs just how companies work or whatever and that was the first time where it was ever like I'm devastated. You know what I mean? And that was the part what you hit on earlier was the fact that like people leave all the time that we like you know what I mean?

You know what I mean? And I didn't want that with him and I didn't know that at the time. You know what I mean? Like I didn't realize his leaving would be that big of a deal. And then when he moved to Oakland it was all different. But like you know, you know what I mean? That's what happens when you move to the East Bay. It's now that thing where like when I see Clements and I'm with Clements, we're right back to it. You know what I mean? It is a personal kind of thing. It is a Colin kind of thing. Yeah. I think that's like what I was saying about the growth kind of thing. You know, the Nicole Tan thing.

It's like we're good. We're totally right there. And like going back to what you were saying, this is interesting because you know we're talking about the acquaintancing and working together and convenience and all this stuff. It's like in the same way this is very similar to IGN where it's like i don't think necessarily we'd hang out with each other if it wasn't for Kinda Funny.

I think that there is something about breaking bread or drinking with someone. And there it's symbolic. It's been eating with someone has been something for thousands of years since since cavemen were sitting around fire.

I like to make sure I'm always friendly. I see regulars. I see people I used to go to elementary school. I'm in a smaller town.

It's a it's a small community and it everyone is just happy. And I look at that as that's a lot of acquaintances. It's not like friends. Um, but the way I describe the parameters of friendship are lifelong friends and I have like maybe three just forever just solidified that they can go wherever they go and the moment they come back it's like you said you snaps and you can just pick it back up and you want to know what they're doing. You know that like you said when you're in your worst spot they're there for you. And I think that it's all about trust and loyalty. And honestly, I just like to laugh.
