You have to do this because if you don't prepare ahead of time, you might pull something like a hamstring. What's a hamstring? I don't know. That sounds nasty. So, Nick, yes. Today's question comes from 22-year-old Dave. Dave says, \"Nick and Tim, what are your thoughts on foreplay? Is it necessary? For how long? I don't always like being the one who needs to initiate everything. What do I do here?\" The answer to your question is foreplay is 100% necessary. I would bench I would say that The good rule of thumb on foreplay, Tim, and you you let me know if I'm off base here. Yeah. Always err on the side of more foreplay than less foreplay. Here's why. Women don't like it when you just go like this and then try to jump right into sex. I'm sorry. That is some weak ass stuff The important thing is this, Dave. You should like foreplay.",

You should like foreplay. Okay? You should never do something just because you think you have to. In sex, that is lame. And you do not want to be lame. If you don't like foreplay, you need to figure out how to like foreplay and you need to learn how to appreciate it because foreplay is the gateway to good play. Very true. Another good rule of thumb is don't forget your thumb. You know, you got a lot of different options going on. Thing there is it's just like, you know, get creative. Figure out what people like. Do a bunch of different things. And there it's it goes the other way, too. I think that uh the girl foreplay, like I appreciate some good foreplay, you know, hand jobs. Damn. Never get enough credit. You see that dome? That dome just wants to be touched. That's all that it needs in life is just a little",

That's all that it needs in life is just a little touch, hands. Foreplay to me is more about building the mood. Okay? And that's and that's for a lot of guys, we don't get this because when we see a woman, we're instantly ready to rock and roll. But women don't think that way. Guys are like, \"Pretty girl, done. That's all I need.\" Right? Yep. I'm ready to go. Ready to rock. Ready to rock. Women need to feel secure. They need the mood set. They need to feel like they are uh uh you know that you're putting forth effort, that you actually care, that you're trying. There's a lot more complexity that goes into them that goes into us. So, you should know this and you should start mastering the art of foreplay because it's very very very very important thing to have in your arsenal when it comes to sex. Mhm. We often talk about lubrication. You",

We often talk about lubrication. You know, you want to be well-lubed. And that is the most important thing about this foreplay stuff - you need to do it to kind of make sure things are ready. I'll tell you this right now, Tim. You know, I'm a huge fan of NASCAR, right? Uh-huh. Before they go out racing, they like to warm those tires up. Makes them all warm and sticky and they adhere to the road a little bit better and they get the most bang out of their grip. Yeah. On those racing slicks. That is foreplay. That is what you're talking about. I mean, you just nailed it there. Like, I don't think that anyone could have possibly said that better. Thank you, Tim. Yeah, that's amazing. That was good. Yeah. But also, you should put the expectation on her that foreplay is important to you",

But also, you should put the expectation on her that foreplay is important to you, right? If she's just if she's not, you know, doing anything to get you going as well, there should be an expectation that you should. So, you guys should talk to each other always. Always talk to each other. And uh, you know, it's a good opportunity to figure out what she likes because guess what? There's more to sex than just the penetration aspect of it. There's more to sex than just penis inside a vagina. Okay. It's a lot more to it. It's a big wide wide world of sports and you don't just have to like baseball. Yeah, that's very true. And the thing about not wanting to initiate every time, that's that's hard. That's a topic, dude. That's a topic for another time. But really what it comes down to is just like you were saying, you got to want to do it. Don't look at initiation as something",

Worry about like trying to make things happen, having a good time, having fun, and getting her where she needs to be. Ladies and gentlemen, this has been another episode of Love & Sex Stuff.
