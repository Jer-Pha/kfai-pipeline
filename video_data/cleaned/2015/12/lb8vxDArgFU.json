So um, especially for GBA, so you know, I feel it's sad to see the 3DS die or dying, but it had to happen. I mean, the same thing's happening to Vita in a much more pronounced way. The 3DS came out, you know, almost five years ago, so it has definitely had a good run and it does have a vast library of amazing games. But like I look at this, and yeah, Majora's Mask is obviously a classic; you know, and I'm happy that it came out on the 3DS. I was surprised by its announcement \u2013 like everyone else, it's one of those things where every time there's a Nintendo Direct, you go to NeoGAF and everyone's like \"Major's mask is coming\".",

U, you know Xenoblade Chronicles like supposedly people love that game I never really got into it and a lot of people have been busting balls about you know about Xenoblade like why aren't you playing Xenoblade? why aren't you playing Xenoblade? I'm like well I don't really want to play the Wii U and you know people like this game's right up your alley and I'm like I'm sure it is uh but it's just not what I want that's not the direction I want to go in right now I just it's Greg's point I kind of feel like you got the point we've made not this time but you know you want your trophies or",

Well, I mean, the biggest problem with the 3DS is you need the new 3DS to play it, so it's even more splintered, you know? Yeah, um, so I could even play it if I wanted to; I still have the original 3DS myself, the little tiny one that's ridiculous. So yeah, yeah, you dust it off once every two years to play something. The last time I played a game in any length was actually when I dusted off to play some Virtual Console games this year. I really want to play Metroid for some reason; I haven't played it in a long time, so I dusted off to play that and that was fun. But Link Between Worlds - uh, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds was the last like native game I really liked, yeah.

So like the Yoshi and Kirby are the okay ones, and then Mario Tennis and Animal Crossing - whatever the hell it's called, the Amiibo Festival... it's like they just did that. They just put that out as not a real Animal Crossing game, you know? No, definitely not.

There's the Mercedes-Benz event that they added. I don't know if you guys saw that, but I love that they can do that. I love that it's just like there are now these platforms for them to go on. And I hope that this is experimenting for the NX. Going to give us... no Mario Maker. I mean, that was one of the things that was amazing - is like, \"Oh, you guys want checkpoints? Sure, we'll give you that in a month, a month and a half here you go.\" Like, okay cool.
