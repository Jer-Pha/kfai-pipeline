Who's played Starwhal before? Show hands! You guys are so... I'm going to eat your goddamn breast. No, uh, Starwhal just came to the PlayStation Network here. Uh, it's this whole thing where you jump and you kill each other and you try to... This is what they didn't tell me. I played this at the E3 panel that was the video game Hunger Games. This is one of the things I had to win to go to the finals, which I did, and then I won the whole thing. You want to hit each other in the heart or your belly because you're a whale with a unicorn horn. It makes perfect sense when you play it. So I thought it was called Narwhal. Is that something different? It's not What's N Hog. Oh we get to choose colors. I'm blue, oh sweet! I want to be green. I'll be orange. Customize... Oh my God, this is a game into this already. I'm so pink body.",

I'm going with tutu and my head is gonna be an afro. I'm good, I'm ready. Lightsaber, excuse me guys, you're not excused. Yeah, lightsaber with the snail. All right, I'm going to wear the blue shell. I'm player well, you going to wear the snail? I should probably get rid of the snail. What's every who's everybody who's who's what color? All right, so I'm orange with the Mega Man helmet and the...

I just hit you; got got hit. What the hell? So is it like... I'm confused. So you're trying to run your ship, and oh god, oh no - X propels you wherever you are. Nick is just sitting there, oh my God. Oh, he's just 69'd whoever the orange one is; just did some fun stuff.
