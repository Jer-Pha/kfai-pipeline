Uh-huh, just like Peach Goblin poop (bit.ly/PeachGoblin). All right, which genre do you think will be the most successful on the current generation consoles, I.E Xbox One and PS4? That's a really cool topic, and when we were looking at it earlier, I was like, \"Oh man, I've never really thought about that.\" Because you know, I think that it's safe to say that last generation, first-person shooters were the dominant most important genre on it. Generation before that, PS2 - yeah, what you got? PS2, man, I don't know... action games. Oh yeah, action definitely is that so you're counting like Grand Theft Auto right? Third-person action, yeah, but also like hack-and-slash and stuff like God of War, all that stuff, definitely. And then the generation before that, role-play games. You think so, yeah. PlayStation one.",

Yeah. PlayStation one generation, like NES and SNES are like about Platformers. And then PlayStation one was really bad or old playing games. And then CU I was going to potentially say 3D Platformers. Yeah, but yeah. Jack, I I think it's safe to say that Platformers and RPGs work for either Super Nintendo generation or N64 generation. But yeah, yeah. Then you go before that, it's just arcade. It's the only gen. I'm sorry, no, no please. Please. I was going to say if you're going off what developers and Publishers want this generation is online co-op, co-op with now. I think you're already seeing like the industry snap hard on that right? That no we don't want that and you can't make games that do that and **** work at launch",

Great, leave me alone so I can play, yeah. Um, what is the question exactly? Can you read it just for me again, just because I want to make sure that I get the exact question, because I have a question about the question, I think, before I get into my answer. Which genre do you think will be the most successful on the current generation? So, what is the definition of successful? I think it's just commercially well, what we just said, like when we think about PlayStation 4 Xbox one generation, so ubiquitous with a platform, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go, let's go with that, okay. I think CU, I still think it's Shooters, and I think that you know it's an it's like Grand Theft Auto V is kind of a shooter now, now that it's in first person or you can play in first person, the not that you have to be in first person.",

I think that because all the everything we were talking about even back in the NES and SNES days to an extent, I mean those teams were small, but these were AAA games as we knew them at the time, you know, uh the original Zelda was made by probably fewer than a dozen people, but it's it's um a AAA game for 1986. So I think that we will see when we look back, I think we will see fewer big triple-A games or big budget games that we really give a **** about. I think that when we look back in 2020, 2025, look back at these games, we're going to be excited about games like Hotline Miami, not games like Call of Duty, which all blur together. I'm I'm not disparaging Call of Duty; I play them every year and I like the shooting mechanics very much, but these games aren't getting everyone.",

I uh, yeah, because I think about the NPD charts every month, and what they're telling us is that people buy the same game over and over again. Now, that's your prerogative if you want to do that, but the NPD charts were exactly the same month over month with the exception of Dying Light being included in February or I guess it was January, I don't know. Like the lists were almost the same, the only thing that changed month over month was that some of the order changed and Dying Light was in there, and Just Dance fell off. I remember that like very well, and I'm like this is the most boring stuff ever, like these are the games... again, this is only judging retail but it shows a stagnation and a predictability in the retail market that's slowly going to wane as their popularity wanes and people kind of go",

But so I don't want to be too hypocritical about it. I just think that when people are buying Madden in FIFA and NBA every year, they're going to buy Assassin's Creed this year, they're going to buy Call of Duty; they will buy Battlefield. Um, um, it just shows a space that is stagnant and boring. It's not to say those games are bad; it's just a boring space. And so I think the big success stories for this generation will be the independent game developers - they, independent game developers - and again how you define that, I don't know. You know, like No Man's Sky is a really important game for PlayStation 4, and it's a buy from an independent Studio but it's not really an independent game, you know? So like we in the",

So, like we in the future, we really need to, and we talked about on Colin, Greg, Colin, and Greg today, where it was like what is the definition of indie, and Indie, and really it's doing funding your own games and making your own games. And there are very so, like for instance Insomniac is an independent studio, but they're huge, there's like 300 of them, you know, they're way more independent than Bethesda, which I think is like 50, you know. So it's not about size, yeah, it's it's like it's a it's a weird and nebulous definition. I feel like it's at this point the way the word's used is not by its actual definition, is not about actually doing just more the the look of the game, the feel of the game, how the game's delivered all that stuff, and I think that we just kind of have to accept that, and that that the new definition of",

Even though yeah, even though Ori is funded by Microsoft, so it's like that's what's so... Yeah, so like it is funny. I would love to really sit down one day and figure out what independent is, and then like really propagate that definition because small or downloadable doesn't mean anything anymore. Um, yeah. And calling an indie game \"indie\" isn't effective as an insult anymore because people are way excited about these games now, which is awesome.
