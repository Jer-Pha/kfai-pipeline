Are you ready? Let's do it. So uh, it's telling me to adjust. I like it'll be a little brighter than usual, so let's do that. On these games, you know what they do? They always say, \"Adjust the maximum scary factor.\" I crank the gamma; I want to see everything coming from like three miles away. I don't like that stuff either. Uh, and I've already gone in and reversed the Y-axis as I do. Thank you; you do that, yeah. Very important for me, good man. Oh yeah, also there's a Paleblood. Let's see what happens. Uh-oh, here's what I'll do: I'm going to start the clock now. You've come to the right place, stop it during the character okay?

I don't know, actually I was going to say Dracula but no, he looks more like a bartender in the Tenderloin. Yeah, yeah okay, so there's this game I see, I feel like it's based on San Francisco in many ways and I'm really interested to see more of it, but at your behest I've gone ahead and named our character Galvatron - it's a dope name. Uh, which you and we'll keep the gender as male, the age... let's see what he looks like if he's aged. Should we have aged? We have mature. Let's go with mature.

Why the hell would I want a Threaded Cane there's got to be a reason, there's got to be that but that's the one that's like everyone in the Master Sport. It's like two months for now are be like why the hell did you choose the Thread of Cane?

So they're just telling you like what what's what people can leave notes and like hints for you, oh really? Mhm, that's cool which are very useful. So like I jumped in this a year from now people like don't do that choose the Threaded Cane but how do I leave like I oh my God look at how beautiful are they're amazing I love them I'm fine to just spend the next 8 minutes looking at these flowers but it'd be dope to get back to that dude and hand him his ass.

Can I just kill myself? I don't want to be in this world; this is a mess-up world. Oh my God, let me out of this world. There's got to be a way to get out of here. Oh, of course, but I'm...

Can we take off the cape? Yeah, let's ditch the hood. Like, why does he have all these things on? I don't want him to have them on. I want him to be as close to naked as this game will allow, 'cause that's where he's fastest when he's unclothed. It's funny that it won't let me use my weapons either.
