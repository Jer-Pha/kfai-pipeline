Um but like Greg plays Destiny, but he's not really going to experience like the best part of that game which is the raid because it allows online and it needs online and it needs like a solid core group of people to work together and so it's there needs to be balance and it's going to be interesting to see where game developers go with that. Yeah I mean I think my only real experience with it is like Meerse, like when you're in that doesn't count but why not the Meerse the posts yeah that's not real online no but what I'm saying is like get out of here no no no no way like it was like semi-invasive like playing through New.",

Should be enjoyed as single-player much like The Order: 1886 \u2013 for as bad as that game wasn't bad, for as subpar as that game was, there was no **** in that game, you know what I mean? Like it was just the campaign, that's what it was. And I wonder when there's issues with a game like not even Titanfall and Call of Duty \u2013 and all these aren't even good examples \u2013 but when a game like Tetris Ultimate is actually a great example.

And like, what's always not worked for us personally in the industry is the fact that we just don't have that much time usually to give into it right; like I love DC Universe Online, I think it's the best MMO of all time because it's the only MMO I've ever played that I fell in love with, and I've got like 500 hours in it.

I feel like it's going to rubber band back like I was saying, and that's how the fad gets smaller or whatever it becomes the movement. I hope so. I just think that they're you know Tim Gettys' point about you play for instance, like I just see like that they'll just cut through the rest anyway because they feel like they have to. That like you can't retreat, you know? I mean that and that and that's when you get into the whole thing of like though that's Ubisoft right? That's not a developer; that's just an example. Sure, sure, sure, you know, of a publisher that you know because I mean think about like the big publishers like they're not going to Sony - the one that's most that the biggest propensity to not do online stuff with their games even though they do do online stuff with their games.
