If you have topics for the show, please tweet at Nick Scarpino with your topic suggestion. Just like Rodney, the author, says San Francisco has become separated from the mainland and turned into a prison zone. How would you rise to power so we're in... we'll say either Escape From New York or escape from LA - those are the two. We'll say New York. It no one wants to be in um New York, Manhattan Island has become a prison zone. Uh, Frisco? No, well why are you changing this? He gave you literally what he wanted you to like now you're like it's a movie that you've seen. Well, that's fine. Okay, so where's the is it the peninsula I would say the peninsula right here. Let's see, let's include South San Francisco but not the airport. Okay, okay deal. It's become separated from... so let's say this earthquake it breaks off the peninsula and it kind of",

No one can save us we're R we can't yeah there's just a body of water between us that's unswimmable and the United States government in its infinite wisdom has decided to make it a prison God damn, just basically throw all the San Francisco Bay before that sounds crazy so we're all stuck here. Yeah okay we've got electricity we got let's assume we've got all everything that we have at our disposal right now how do we rise to power in this or do we or do we just die for but how would we why are we making that assumption because if there was a a catastrophic earthquake that split San Francisco into an island that didn't floated towards into the bay we would have nothing anymore we'd be totally cut off, the bridges would also be broken so the the so there would be no conduit.\"",

It doesn't... it's just, we floated out into the ocean. Well, we're assuming it's a prison, so by nature of that, the United States government wants to keep it there and keep them alive to some degree, right? Cuz it's a prison, but why would they let it be self-sustaining? What's the point? Let me read the question - that's what it says. We're lost in the weeds. Well, it says it's separated... did it say we're a prison? It's like Escape from New York; they've done that because I don't know what to do. This is all confusing, okay.

Speak yourself. All right, then. Then we also have the Avenue of like the Stanley Cup in The Hunger Games. We could be like that; people would like us. We'd be on camera. Oh okay, I get that. So we're going to...I don't know if that's Stanley Cup or not. Let's just not change anything. Let's just keep doing what villains do. They're going around with our version of the straw hat and the cane. Well, I feel like people will need entertainment in this new post-apocalyptic world.

You're Mr. Escape From New York. I mean, my first thought is... um, I don't know why, but I don't think we can fight our way out there; there will always be someone tougher.

Yeah, I want to be prepared. Just let me walk out to Berkeley, game all right, I'm right, leave me alone. The one thing that I don't think they touched on an Escape from LA or Escape From New York, and that they'll, you know, that we're missing here is that if there was a catastrophic earthquake that would split San Francisco off into the ocean, we'd have way bigger problems than being split off into the ocean as then.

Yeah, no like like and that's going to affect all these markets around the United States then. And I brought this up to you Greg where I was like what if this drought, 'cause they're saying this might be a decades-long drought that we're in the middle of, that started in like 2003 and California has not experienced it since it's been settled so like what if there just is no water for 50 years and then people can't live here anymore. And then everyone has to go East and then it creates all this strain and stress. There's like this is a pretty catastrophic problem which is why I think they're actually not talking about it because they're like this is actually bad and we can't control it, you know it doesn't matter how much you",

What do planes run on water? Not going anywhere that's a good point, that's a really good point but yeah we should definitely unpack that more in the future cuz there's like all these I was reading a lot like all these unintended consequences of what happens here yeah you know and like that we might be on the brink of something pretty pretty serious cuz like I was saying like if it's a 50 year drought or something like that and we just were like oh we have to save water and then we just drink half as much water, then we have two years worth of water, it doesn't matter",
