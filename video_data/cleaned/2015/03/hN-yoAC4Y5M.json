They're not like totally, \"Oh, we missed that fact that that boss was cheap\" or this happened or that you could see through that wall or whatever. And I think that's one of the what separates the good from the great in terms of game development. A lot of these guys have different ways of achieving this, but to make your game great, uh, you need a lot of there's a you need, you need something special. It could be extra time, a really supportive publisher, you know, ton of money to throw people on the problem. Uh, you need to have some kind of policy that it's like, \"We're not going to ship until it's ready\" and whatever, and screw you guys. That's kind of like a Blizzard approach, you know.",

But when you're at the point where I'm going to liquidate all my money and put it behind my own staff to support them for two months to get this out, and stuff like that, what's going through your head is, \"Is it just me? There's no other way, so you have to make this work,\" or that's basically it, right? Yeah, there was no way I was going to ship. I remember I was in a meeting; I remember talking to Darcy, our producer, and she's like, \"We have to ship.\" You know, they believe me when I say, \"This is our burn rate; this is how much money we have left.\" Like, we have to ship, you know?

Yeah, I was like, \"Dad, I'm 31 years old, I don't need a 401k right now.\" Right? And so yeah, used to want that as an extra backstop. But yeah, it's just when you invest so much time in, like, the Kickstarter backers too. You have 11,611 guys and gals who backed your project a year or two before that, and you don't want to disappoint them. You have this responsibility as a Kickstarter or as a Patreon right to do good by the other guys too. Like, if your game sucks, it's another mark against crowdfunding. Right?

Um, and if anything, the thing that's at a high level super super happy - don't worry, not worried about critical acclaim or not for our game. That being said, uh, I was surprised by the lack of enthusiasm on the mobile side for our game, cuz as you guys know, the game first came out on iOS and then Android, and now it's finally on PC and Mac, and I thought we were making like the game for these like you know mobile app reviewers, but a lot of these guys were tearing us apart way more than like the console-focused guys that are playing the game - like IGN or GameSpot or Game Informer or Eurogamer.

Stealth action is one of the least user-friendly genres; sure, it's always fun to fail over and over again so you figure out what... oh, that's what I need to do. But people get so frustrated. I remember watching I was in MGS4 reviews and preview events stuff like that, and just watching really hardcore guys who say that Metal Gear is their favorite franchise getting really pissed off at the game and hating it because stealth action is kind of by design a really frustrating genre. You know? You guys have to play that if you sit down and play Metal Gear; you have to be in the right mindset, y'know, and sometimes it's just not.",

Like, on average when we did the free app of the week with Apple, we had millions of downloads, awesome. Wait to wait, on average most players were getting caught eight times in episode one, that's way too much and they were quitting all the time, yeah, it was just uh, that was a tactical error. So we feel a lot more at home right now on PC and Mac because we feel like, yeah, the user base is a little bit more used to this genre, oh definitely.

Today on Colin and Greg Live, we talked about you know, Greg sent out a tweet to Shahid, and Gio, Cory, and Shuhei Yoshida to try to get the game on the Vita, which is where I think it really belongs, and on PS4, PS3, um, because there's definitely still a huge user base there.

But what I love about it is that if developers who show Vita love \u2013 I don't mean just put a game on V, but like show Vita love \u2013 they'll write PlayStation Blog posts, and DrinkBox is a great example exactly. Who I was thinking of when they're like, \"We write PlayStation blog posts, and we make these games, and they work on Vita, and frankly maybe they're best on Vita, and stuff like that.\" They get rewarded. And I was at GDC a couple years ago when DrinkBox gave a talk, and someone asked, \"Why would you put your game on V and not on iOS?\" And they're like, \"Cuz like V Gamers buy games, and iOS Gamers don't, you know?\" And like that's why we're like...

You know, two years ago it was something like 12, which is insane, ridiculous. So it's like people who read the PlayStation Blog comments or read our Twitter account or when we used to do Beyond! Podcast, they're just crazy about that device. And if people support it, they buy the game, you know? And so I really feel like you guys have a hardcore game that speaks to that audience, and if you gave that audience love by giving them the game, I bet you they'd buy it, sure, you know.

If we come to Vita, it needs to be an event right, whether they get episode four early or episode 5 early, or we have exclusive content for it, or we're just optimizing the hell out of the sucker. We have Cloud saves, you know, from Vita to PS3 to PS4 or whatever, anything and everything we can do to make the game, and that's actually one thing I learned from Metal Gear - one of the great things about Metal Gear is like no matter what platform they're on, they're always using those unique features right off the platform of the controller. And so that's what we want to do. So hopefully uh Sony or you know if Microsoft wants to do that with Xbox whatever, we're we're always open to talking about those kinds of things but that's exciting well good luck with that I think that yeah there's going to be demand I think from the first parties for your game so and there",
