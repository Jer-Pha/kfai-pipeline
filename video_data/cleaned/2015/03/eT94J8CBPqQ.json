Yeah, I definitely do want to have one tonight. So, with me? Yeah, yeah, not a lady friend. Yeah, no, no, no. Do those count over here tonight? You tell me. You defined it. You're sleeping over tonight. Yeah. Oh, why'd you do the eyebrows stop doing the eyebrows? Ra, I know, man. So all night sleepovers are a very important thing for friendships and uh for your formative years in a lot of ways. And I feel like we all have stories and I'd love to hear your guys' stories because I definitely know I have some. Okay, yeah. Sleepovers are great. Mhm. I my my sleepover stories range... We did the stupid stuff you do. You stay up all night. You try to do this whatever. I feel like every sleepover every good sleepover reaches that point where you're just like let's all right it's already 2 a.m. Let's just let's stay up till sunrise.

Like, all right cool, we'll wait for you here on the lawn of this guy's house. Of this guy I'm sure nothing bad will happen. So we just sat down and bullshitting in this guy's yard or whatever, and I don't know how he did it 'cause he did it like Batman but like literally all of a sudden, flashlight on Mike, and some of like what the hell are you doing out here?

Interrupt it - that was like even when Tim came to visit me the last couple times when I lived in Brooklyn, it was like we were staying up late listening to records and you know just kind of shooting the bull, and it felt like a sleepover. I think that's it. It's the are you staying up till 3:00 a.m. not wanting to go to sleep like you? If you have that moment where you're both laying in the same room when you don't need to be laying in the same room, and you're both pretending you're asleep, and then like after 15 minutes of silence there's the \"hey are you still awake dude\". I had a recent experience like that. I was in San Diego working on a music project, and um I was in a hotel with uh my buddy Ron who's a drummer, and we had gone back just from like a long night of drinking, and we were just laughing about everything, and it definitely turned into that you-you wake yeah and like just cracking up",

And it's like waking up in the morning and everyone else being asleep, and you just having to be like, \"I need to pretend to sleep; I don't want to be the first one to get up.\" It's awkward when the parents start fighting, and it's just like, \"Why are you fighting?\" It's like, \"Can you not do this while we're here?\" Or when the parents start fighting with your friend, and you're just like, \"Well, this is awkward. Am I supposed to be on whose side?\" And the mom gets you involved, Tim, think whose side are you on?

Sorry for me. I feel like my story, you know? I have a lot of friends that I have sleepovers with, like because I still am friends with my middle school high school friends, but I feel like more than anything is Kevin, because the man they call \"Disgusting\" me and Kevin, yeah... Me and Kevin grew up together, and at this point we had so many sleepovers that CU [he] lived in Daly City, I lived in San Francisco, so it was kind of a commute to get to him. So I'd get on the 28, get over to him, and at this point the night of the sleepover to me is more like the movie version of it where it's like this is probably a hundred different sleepovers but in my head it is just one night, one night of just...",
