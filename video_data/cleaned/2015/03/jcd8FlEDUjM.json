Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff, so thanks for your support on Patreon.com of Kinda Funny. We're back for one last season of me reaching into the random topic pile, pulling one out, tossing it at him, and us talking it out for your amusement if you like that. Like the video, subscribe to our channel, share us with your friends, and of course keep supporting us on Patreon. We have no real jobs. Colin, are you ready? Yes, today's topic of conversation is Star Wars - in your change of heart. This is from Stan Huskey over on Patreon.com. What an emotional roller coaster this has been if you famously infamously came on A Conversation With Colin and declared Star Wars is dead to me, and I said what about the new ones, and you're like no, I'll never watch them. Here we are though, the trailer's out, you got the Han Solo lightsaber with the Mandalorian on it, and you're like",

You got the Hanukkah lightsaber with the manor on it, and you're like a man. Yeah, candidly, my excitement for the new Star Wars movie began to grow when they released that black-and-white photo, and it showed the cast sitting around in a circle. Right, right, right, right, right. Um, and there was some old faces in there, and I'm like, \"Okay, that's one check box for me\" - like paying homage to Return of the Jedi and Empire and A New Hope, and having some of those characters in there is great. And then some rumors began to circulate that they were really doing right by the models that they were making the X-wings and the Y-wing and Millennium Falcon. Yeah, and then I saw that trailer, and it's very quick trailer - it's disappointingly short, but actually really long considering what they show you, or is it tantalizingly short? It is tantalizingly short. Yeah, they show no",

It is tantalizingly short. Yeah, they show no recognizable characters which is stupid on my except for like a guy as a stormtrooper and the Stormtroopers. But other than that, it's like Millennium Falcon - right, an iconic ship. Does everybody know that it talks? I don't know much about Star Wars - not an sentient ship. No, okay. It's actually kind of like a ship compared to a lot of ships in the... that's part of its charm. Okay, um. But I saw it, and I'm like this is shot well. It's shot right. It looks right. It doesn't look like George Lucas came and **** everything up, and it's clear that they're paying attention to what they need to be doing - that the world needs to be lived in and gritty looking, not all clean and weird, and everyone is acting on you know blue screens... whatever they're green screens.",

In New Hope or Empire, episode one, yeah, people shaking their heads, yeah, yeah. Right. And uh, I just was very pleased by that, just by the aesthetic of it. And then you know, so it's enough like the original trilogy to win your heart back after being broken over the prequels, yeah. Because the prequels, I went back and watched them, and I was talking to someone at work, and I'm like, \"Yeah, I gotta go back and watch that.\" Remember me Joe Black came out, and they attached episode one's trailer first. One C-3PO, right? I don't remember who was in it, but I just remember everyone went to see me Black. Well, no, you should have stayed because this is the girl from Attack of the Clones, Anakin Skywalker's love interest, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and I think she gets naked in it. Oh, I never watched it very well.",

Oh, I never watched it very nice. Didn't watch it, but I think that's what I heard. Okay, we don't know. We don't really know. Love can we...this into? I do love Mortal Kombat. Well, if you want, I think we already did Mortal Kombat though. Didn't we? No, no, we're talking about Kevin Smith okay. Um, and I...I just watched that episode one. I'm like, man, this sucks. Like, why did anyone get excited about this? This sucks. But people did get excited about it. We did all get excited. Are you afraid of being tricked again by this trailer? No, and that's the thing is because the aesthetic everything's different about those two trailers if you watch them. And they are not using visual tricks anymore like they did obviously. Like they have to use the technology that's available but it doesn't have to be all that. It's practical effects there's a lot of touchstones to",

There are a lot of touchstones to the trilogy that the trilogy that matters really resonate with me and I think that it's exciting in the sense that we're going to have a new kind of connection to the original trilogy that was relevant, you know. So, I... It made me realize and believe that there's more to this than I gave credence to maybe I was wronged to write it off because my love of Star Wars: A New Hope and Jedi and The Empire go really deep; my hatred of Episode One, Two, and Three goes maybe even deeper. No way, impossible but I love those movies so much and those characters so much and that those worlds so much and that environment so much that I just seeing Tatooine again and seeing Tatooine as it",

I used to watch the trailer when I woke up on my phone.\" She's like, \"You look like a 10-year-old right now, with a grin from ear to ear, just with the music and seeing the Falcon and seeing the X-wing.\" And it was uh, it was pretty surreal to see a real Star Wars movie that looks like it's going to be a real Star Wars movie again. Well, that's great. I'm glad you're happy again. You always find something else to be mad about, but I'm glad this is fixed for you. I'll... I'll figure something out. We'll talk about this many times, I'm sure. The next trailer would disappoint me or something like that. There's plenty of stuff coming on Kinda Funny.com. Colin, thank you for your time.
