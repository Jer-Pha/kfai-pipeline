Like you can't download the majority of those games, you know, PS1 Classics - those are things you can PR download, but the majority of the PS2 games I would want to go back to there's no way for me to play it because it's not backwards compatible and you can't download it all. Stuff I'm so glad I didn't trade in all my PS2 games; I kept all of them. Yeah, by that generation, I had smartened up because to your question, I had a catastrophic blunderous encounter at EB in 1997.

And that was my favorite trade. CU, I was like, I actually really enjoyed that game, and I had a lot of fun with it, but I made some really bad decisions. I got a PS2, and I had no games because that was the deal - mom was like, \"I'll get you the PS2, but like, you need to wait on the games.\" And it's like, well, that sucks. I really wanted a game so badly that I traded in multiple N64 games for Crazy Taxi because it was one of the cheap PS2 games just because I wanted it.

The worst Anarchy Reigns no no no no no. The only game I ever re-bought was uh Spider-Man 2 on PS2 because I I i'd played it, I'd done everything in it, I was like whatever, and then I went out for a summer to an internship in DC and there I would just come home on the weekends and like there's nothing really to do or whatever.

It reminded me of my ultimate video game trade-in scheme that I ever pulled off, yeah. Was um EB was doing a thing when the PSP came out where you can trade in three um current gen games which at the time was Xbox GameCube PS2 and you can get a PSP game. And I looked at the list and I did a lot of research on what games you could trade in and all that stuff, and I was like what's the cheapest game you can possibly get to trade in? And you know obviously at that point they wouldn't let you do what you did with like every sports game because like they just would give you nothing for it.
