It's a small country but it's very densely populated right, and so I was out there in the country not really knowing what I was doing cried my first night, and uh, but thankfully I had this freelance gig with SiIvaGunner (note: likely a reference to the YouTube channel \"SiIvaGunner\", which is known for its humorous video game music covers) Davis so I was for uh Xbox Nation magazine 1UP.com EGM, and ended up writing for Wired and Japan Times, so I was able to kind of subsist or kind of regain my sanity by teaching English, which I wasn't really a big fan of, but about",

I fought really hard for that one. So, uh, yeah, I was just... I was traveling over to Tokyo on the weekends, uh, to Tokyo; people the guys I was working with had never been to Tokyo and I was going there every weekend because I just couldn't stay in this like you know backwater town \u2013 it was nice people but just wasn't for me. So anyway, um, I was covering the beat; I was a freelance writer and uh were you living in like Inaba? Was this like... was this Persona?

So there's like 200 kids for this the school that would that could house 2,000, and it's just really scary and haunting, and nobody my age, and it was weird, it was a weird, weird place to spend two years of my life, but uh I I did again kind of like was able to kind of connect with with something I really love about writing about video games, and uh.",

This is so weird.\" And he like, and then it kind of cut to the chase like, \"Hey, are you interested in interviewing uh, I have an open position for a bilingual you know guy.

I'm translating for myself; I'm telling what's happening; I'm explaining. It's a baller thing as I frankly think it shows a level of modesty for you to know you're fluent in Japanese, and regardless of your wanting to get a job or whatever, I don't necessarily think he would have read into that if you just spoke to him in Japanese.

One thing I want to know is, so Konami made this mistake or Kojima made a mistake or his people made a mistake where they selected you and then they didn't tell you? Do you know the story behind that? Was it that they were like, \"We told the wrong guy,\" we messed up clerically, or did they change their mind and say, \"Oh, this is not the guy we wanted\"?

Well then I left three years later, so maybe bit him in the ass big time, but no. So what is the role they're bringing you on for? So what they brought me on for in Japanese was called Kay Tanto, which Kay Tanto means as you yeah you guys are very familiar K is like foreign or Outsider International and then Tanto is kind of like uh in charge of or manager so it was kind of in English I I I gave myself the title International Manager and then they're like no no no you're not a manager, you're not managing anything.

Do you guys like the box? I get the box art from Europe and America, I take it and put in front of Hideo so it's kind of like a messenger back and forth just trying to coordinate with the different branches.
