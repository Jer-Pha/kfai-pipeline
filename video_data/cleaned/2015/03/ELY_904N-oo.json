And you could totally see that. I actually really appreciate it that they were fun to work with, that's cool.

I'll one day ask him, but you know he's a pretty chill dude until he spills your drink on yourself. Yeah, he spilled my drink on me. All right, I understand what you're saying.

Uh, by the way, the first game was \"Disruptor.\" In case people are curious, but um, there wasn't a lot. There wasn't an established first-party at that point, so that's not a good example. Then PS2 had a lot of games, but a lot of random games like \"Fantavision,\" which was an internal game; \"Taiko no Tatsujin\" (also known as \"Taiko: Drum Master\"); \"SSX Tricky\"; \"Summoner\"; and stuff like that. But I don't know, and Smuggler's Run was a thing, but like I think PS2's launch lineup to me was about volume, it was not about quality. And I don't think good games really started to come to the console until you got \"Anubis\" (also known as \"Ape Escape 3\") and a few others. It took a while in my opinion, but it had some 7.5s and eights, yeah, launch 75s or eights, you know what I mean, like it.",

By the time PS3 rolled around, first-party was more um, was going a little harder on a first-party studio, but Resistance is an exclusive that was a launch title; they had MotorStorm from Evolution I think before they even owned Evolution, um, so things got things were kind of weak. PSP had a pretty decent launch lineup too, um, and then I think Vita had a strong launch line, I think PS4's was pretty good, I don't know if you guys agree with that.

I don't think Insomniac would want to do it anymore so I think if you look at for PS5, I think a strong launch lineup of three exclusives would be Resistance: Fall of Man again... MH um, you have The Getaway and you just call what you call it that Fall of Man again. Yeah, Fall of Man again in parentheses. Yes, I like that. Like with an ellipsis uh I think You'd have something like that and then I think something like Uncharted would be would be perfect so I mean that was that's how I stand.

So I think it's just a matter of like what's ready to go. Infamous was supposed to be a launch game and so so was Drive Club, so it's just a matter of what was available at the time. Uncharted was a launch game for Vita, Golden Abyss yeah that's true and I think still the that's a great point. I think it's still the most console quality game on the platform and still one of the best games on the platform. So I think you could it couldn't hurt that game also sold over a million copies on you know.

I understand what you guys are saying, but I do question the wisdom in why you can't have it both ways. That if like a console, like the first parties have access to these consoles very early.

But it took us over a year to get to that point when maybe it would have been nice to have that game right off the bat like why not have that game right off the bat? V did give us that game or about it didn't work obviously. But so it's you know, when a game like Infamous comes out second sun is I think the worst Infamous game, it's a it's a it's a good game, I liked it, it was just a little under again undercooked and I don't know kind of empty. Um, so if it's not ready to go don't put it out but why can't why not prepare a great AAA launch exclusive? Why not you know, and then you can you can still have that game a year or 18 months out like Bloodborne. Well, so okay moving on to Nintendo like with the NX what if they did just do uh the Galaxy Sequel and what if that was the one game because you you do have to imagine",

Yeah, and it's surprising; I wouldn't see Nintendo doing that. Like, so far, at least the last couple of generations, they haven't done it - it's always been like, down the line you get the Mario game, but like with Sunshine and then Galaxy. But I feel like that would be huge for them; they need that. They should look at the NX and treat it more like the 64, where it's this is why you're buying this console - we don't need to do all the sports games and all the other stuff. Like, here is the one game you're going to buy by the system by the game. But are those big Mario releases as much of a big thing now, like, to us, to people who you know grew up playing those games? Yes, that's like we want that bad; I'm sure. But you look at the sales and I think that like the new Super Mario Brothers games",

Wii see how well that did I don't know that is interesting though I mean Galaxy still sold super well it did well yeah gy you're just comparing it to like yeah freaking craziness but I think the new one sold significantly better interesting which I I like those games too me too I prefer the big main series stuff yeah yeah yeah the bigger question you guys problem I never even thought about is are we really going to go the entire Wii U generation without a Mario and I",

Um, so I hope that they don't do that again. That was a that was a bit of a that was a bit much for me. That was a bit of a cop out just inverting the game to make Link a righty. It's like the like that was so weird. You know? I was like, but they they didn't want to strand their game on that hardware and I don't really blame them. So it is an interesting conundrum that they're in. It's a good problem to have, I guess, in a sense, even though it's also a really bad problem to have because their console's already dead.
