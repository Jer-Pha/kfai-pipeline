Government in action. It's called \"For the First Time\" You can now directly buy the game that Forbes magazine called \"House of Cards\". The gameplay as a member of Congress and learn exactly how difficult it is to grow your political capital by passing and sponsoring bills, asking lobbyists for money, and paying to get media attention all while trying to take care of the people in your home district so you get re-elected. That does sound really good actually. This sounds very Colin. Very. He got what is it \"Muzzy Muzzy Lane\" making games just for you a world leader in",

Muzzy Lane making games just for you. A world leader in digital game-based learning for Colin Moriarty. For Colin Moriarty, all right. So let's... I got other stuff here. I got plenty of other stuff. The first one I got in my hand is Y2K. Did you see this one? No. Postmodern RPG. It's set... it's post-RPG, yeah. It's goofy. It's in America. I want to say it's in Portland, but I'll forget that part. Guy definitely looks like a hipster with a beard and flannel. You already know I'm going with the '90s are alive in Portland. He's in a record store right there. So you get it, Colin. What this is is the Japanese RPG gameplay put into an English game where this man is like living with his mom. His life's not so hot. An American game exactly meets this girl, then he's got to go... This thing. There's parts of like... there's like some platforming in there. There's some Zelda-like bomb.",

So I'm looking at this here: a killer Earthbound hipster hybrid, Heaven according to Destructoid, take on RPG battles with vinyl records, Norm core threads, and weaponized Panda plushies. Brave parallel Dimensions, existential humor, and Meandering Exposition right. Panda plushies... uh what's most exciting me about this is that it's coming to Vita, yes PlayStation 4, and Wii U. Y2K, a postmodern RPG okay so that that's the sub when when you said when you called it a postmodern RPG I'm like what are you talking about how is it a post-RPG but it's actually calling itself that yeah okay I'll allow it.

If you're ever in France, you see the different colored lines right there, and trains moving on these lines while you watch, and it's, you know, just like a map would look or whatever the subway system is, and you have to give them the best routes to drop off their passengers; their passengers are represented by basic shapes: triangle, circle, square. You can see how many, like different ones you can tell, like okay, I have a lot of squares in this train but it's going way away, but I've got to try to get it to the square drop-off point faster, get these people to the triangle route faster, and obviously as you play, you get progressively harder; you have to keep trying to get these lines under management.",

Exactly that was what I was thinking. You're right there with me. Yeah, that's Game Over Greggy, you better be listening. That's 100% sure. But I was thinking maybe on my iPad it'd be something to whatever. Now here's an interesting one. I want to bring this one up. Did you get to play this one? He played like two games. Everybody go to hecticcube.com, h-c-i-cube.com. This one was made by Graham Goring of course the gentleman who made the Conor McGregor intro for Game Over Greggy. He did the very special Podcast Beyond New York Comic-Con thing; he's known for doing these different graphics which is great or whatever right?

Your bar, your paddle, is bouncing back and forth right? But what you're trying to do is slam the puck into the other person's paddle to make the paddle smaller, to you know kill it. Yeah, the way you do this is basically if I'm using Colin's phone, I would pull back here on the screen on my side, and it would make a little another little uh projectile that would fly out and hit the puck.

Um 12 Minutes is interesting because it's like Groundhog Day With Murder, so you play the same 12 minutes over and over again trying to stop the outcome, so every time you play it you learn something new about what's going to happen but like it was described a little bit poorly but the idea just is you come home or your wife's there.",
