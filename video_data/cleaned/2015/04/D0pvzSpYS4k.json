That bothers my girlfriend because I still love Tera Patrick and it's not the T now, it's like the Tara back then. Because that was my chick. You had a chance to meet her at Comic-Con last year, Tera Patrick came to IGN's ComiCon part, I would have lost my right arm if I'd gone to see her and it was a disaster. I would have probably fainted because I loved her so much and it was disappointing to watch her downfall. People are mean to her but whatever, I don't know her.
