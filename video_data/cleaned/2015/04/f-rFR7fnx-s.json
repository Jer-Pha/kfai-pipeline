Tim Gettys here he thought he had it all see now the crowd just not happy let's see if I can win him back this is hard and I like that. So, that's one of the interesting things right is that he had it on regular and it was something that was easily just familiar to him but then he turned it up and easily was challenging and so now the crowd just not this yeah I'm used to this I'm definitely used to this all right let's see if I can bring it back. So for what I'm seeing is this fine balance of you know easy to easy to play hard to master yeah which is what it should be. Tim they're kind yeah that's pretty cool see the crowd's kind of getting into it the man's looking at him like what are you doing dude ah Tim",
