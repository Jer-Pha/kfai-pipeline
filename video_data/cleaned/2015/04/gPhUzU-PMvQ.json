I think um they're showing signs, glimmers of hope even Final Fantasy VII's re-release on PS4, which a lot of people are disappointed in because it's not like really touched up or anything like that; it's a sign that at least they're listening. Um, but with Bravely Second and Bravely Default obviously, and then Star Ocean, um, they're getting back to their roots a little bit, which I think is a positive thing for role-playing gamers because I've gotten you know some people are mad at me out there about what I say about JRPGs.
