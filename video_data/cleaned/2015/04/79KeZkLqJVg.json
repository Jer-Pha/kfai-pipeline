Yeah, well at least announced, sure, sure, sure. So like they've given dates for all of them except for like four of them, I think Falco and like Falcon - I know Falcon doesn't have his but it's like I never ever in my life would have thought that I'm going to get a Star Fox figurine in stores, yeah, that makes no sense. An Ike from Fire Emblem, what? Yeah, like there's all these like crazy things, and so there's Smash Bros, and now there was the Mario line, and then there now there's Yoshi's Woolly World, which is amazing - little yarn ones, I'm definitely getting one of those, I'm.",

Do you really play Skylanders? I do not all the time, I need to play more but it's um it's a hard game, it's most fun when you're playing in Toy Box with friends and the only friend I have that plays in Toy Box regularly is Brandon Jones so see that my thing with I agree completely with what you're saying but I just I don't think that Skylanders or Amiibo are the right answer like it's not like if Nintendo made that that it'd be like all right now it's worth buying these things like I don't know that we need a game based on that cuz that might be a problem cuz then you have to buy all these things to make this game fun and like that's an issue like I I'm not going to buy them to get additional costumes and stuff like that but like if they were the no but imagine if",

Yeah, I, I remember I did a demo of Infinity and I was just like, I, I love these little figures, I love Disney more than I should and I want these things but it's like I don't want to play this game, I really don't. Well, I would say Infinite's gameplay strengths are in the toy box whereas Skylanders' gameplay strengths are in their actual like campaign. I think that they just did a much better job of making that gameplay accessible and exciting to people that are above the age of like 10 um and I think we'll see in in the Infinity team take it even further with the next Infinite that they're going to announce which hopefully will be happening sometime soon, they announced it around this time last year um so I just think that they",

I mean, \"problem\" in quotes because I don't really care about the Amiibos right. I'm a Sega kid. I wish I had... I wish I made different choices, and the characters meant more to me than they do. They don't. I respect everybody, and don't get me wrong, but like you know when the Mega Man came out, I made sure I pre-ordered it for Colin for Christmas, like that was his Christmas gift, and even that got here in March.
