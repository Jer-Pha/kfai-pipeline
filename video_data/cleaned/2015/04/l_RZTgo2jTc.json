My name is Colin Moriarty, this is Nick Scarpino, and we've been listening to you, our precious Kinda Funny fans, who've been asking us to play Ori and the Blind Forest, an Xbox exclusive game. Um, and uh, so we're going to do just that for you, uh, Ori and the Blind Forest came out on Xbox One earlier this year, I think it's coming to PC or it might already be on PC at some point this year, and I think it's coming to Xbox 360 actually later this year too. But right now, for sure, you can play it on Xbox One, and that's where we are playing it. Thanks to our friends at Microsoft. So, Nick, you and I um, we saw this at the Microsoft showcase that they did about two months ago. Yep, and they gave us three different saves at that point to get into like kind of the beginning area of the game, kind of the middle of the game, and then towards the end of the game to try out some new mechanics. We're going to",

We're going to start from the break, we're going to start from the beginning and just see what happens. It would be cool, I mean everyone's already seen that level but I like the level where the gravity starts to become sort of a puzzle element so that's hopefully we can get to that stage at some point. I guess we can skip around, we can skip well we have to get to that point but we can't we have no save here. But I intend to play this game all the way through. People unfamiliar with it, Moon Studios made this game for Microsoft with the help of Microsoft Studios. This is I think their first game as a studio, as far as I know. I've never heard of them before this game but I don't know everything so maybe I'm wrong. They are located in Europe and the game is a Metroidvania-style game.",

I would say typically time to play is really important, but when you tell a story this good and this riveting, and something this sad that makes you want to see more, right? You could\u2014you can get away with doing a 10-15-20 minute intro. Um, but the usual so-called \"time to fire\" and all that kind of stuff is pretty important in the game. We still have not played it into it, though. I mean, mostly you're playing, and I'm watching anyway, so I kind of had a backseat feel to this whole let's play to begin with. Oh, is he dead?

Yeah, I'm controlling it. Get up, come on! What's his name, Nabo? I don't know, I don't know who's who anymore. I thought the big guy was Naru; maybe in this game or was he?

They aren't kidding around with this. Huh, they're not screwing around. Oh dear, is it living again? These flowers did he die too or something? I think he died. Yeah, his life force went into the ground into this tree. This is like very Studio Ghibli. Yes, oh my God. I don't even know if I want to play this now. My light revived. A new age had dawned.
