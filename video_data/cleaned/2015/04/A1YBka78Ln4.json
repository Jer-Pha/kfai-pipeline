And so well, yeah. But so we went, we went sixth and seventh grade without Pok\u00e9mon because it's just, that's whatever. But then Ruby and Sapphire came out on GBA and it was like the next gen, here's new Pok\u00e9mon. It was the first one that didn't tie in with the first two games, and I remember all my friends, it was that moment of like, \"Oh, we're supposed to be cool, we're not supposed to like this.\" Oh, did you buy you bought it?

No, no, it says I mean that's like is M versus Capcom superheroes because it has superheroes in it. I mean, yeah, yeah, right. No, so you're talking about like a standalone character's story or the X-Men franchise. We need some more Asian apocalypse games, remember those? No, X-Men Legends. Oh, I gave you the sub title, sorry, gotcha. Yeah, else we good. Some dungeon crawler, remember them? Remember these; they were on PSP, remember the PSP version. I never played those versions. No, so what's the story for week three? Week three, week three, we're going to No, we're going to try to step up. You only got a month just but I'm going to know the X's and O's, man.

Yeah, entirely a fast and Furious game would be awesome if done right, but it would never be done right; it wouldn't be done right; it would never be the best. You can hope for is that when they end the franchise, they start continuing on that way. Yeah, cuz that would make sense if like you know, like you just pick up where it always was, Dom's got some shoppies running or something, and Vin Diesel is like the main NPC, and you come in, and he sees something; I don't know; he's like the quest giver. Yeah, exactly. I never thought about how much I want a comic continuation of Fast and Furious until right now. You don't want a comic continuation; season 11 of you; you always think you do, and then you don't. I do; I think it can be okay for it to just be over. I see what you're",

Well, yeah, because it's their most profitable franchise ever. Right. I don't agree with that. I think that The Fast and Furious movie I just watched should have been the last one. No, think about there's three more coming for sure. Right? Not three, not three, three S. Thought I heard there was two more, at least two more. This is the start of a new trilogy, or whatever. Oh, I thought it was... I'm sorry, I thought there was a new trilogy Beyond this or whatever. Imagine how bad then the next movie is going to be. Well, what are you basing this on?
