But being a grown-up seeing these movies like well I think Back to the Future one was a bit better than you know we were not selling pizza product placement in the next one, you know what I mean? That was like the turnaround point, you know what I'm saying? I think it was all tricks before I think our kid eyes were happy with a flying car and a flying DeLorean. So it's like Ninja Turtles where it's like now you look back like the first one was definitely better but when you were a kid the second one was definitely better, it had Vanilla Ice and it had the bop and Rock Steady knockoffs, yeah whatever the hell their names are, Gorillaz or something, I don't know.

I was like, \"I want a hoverboard!\" This is the better movie, yeah, this is awesome. I mean, no one was cooler than Marty McFly - my parents' generation was the generation that grew up during that time period, probably. Maybe a little later in that time period, actually. Um, you've heard the disturbing fact, and it's now passed that if they did Back to the Future now and present day or whatever, they'd be going back to like 1985 or whatever - like that's how old we are, old that movie is. Right? It's like, \"Oh my God.\" Which they should do; they should just reboot Back to the Future and do that.",

But um, no, I mean the second movie was good, and it's funny because my wife actually was one of the ones that brought it to my attention; she was like, \"You know, the first one was better?\" Right? I'm like, \"No way,\" the second one had this and this and this, and Biff was in the future, and all this stuff. And then you watch them back to back, and you're like, \"Oh, you know what? It actually has a lot more heart.\" It is the original. Um, similar to how The Fast and Furious - the first Fast and Furious movie is the better Fast and Furious.

It's a horror; you're talking about a horror thriller, a sci-fi horror thriller movie versus an action genre movie which is the second one, which is why everyone that watches it similar to Back to the Future, which you watch that and it has all the elements of a movie that you'd love because it's action, it's got the Colonial Marines, it's got the cool attack and all the weapons and stuff like that. And it's about teams getting wh around totally different movie though than the first one. Yeah, the first one is very much about that psychological horror of being trapped in an enclosed environment with this thing that is picking you off one by one.

No, but that was a movie that was God, that was so devastating when that movie started because they killed off Hicks and you're like, \"Why wouldn't you just keep Hicks?\" You wanted to see more Ripley and Hicks, like, and Newt for all intents purposes, because you know eventually she was going to grow up and stop saying stupid things.

The hoverboard, no it's the garbage disposal engine that was pretty amazing. Oh yeah Mr Fusion.

And you were like, oh my God, to me that was like Lucas's 1977 moment with Fox where they go, \"We just don't value licensing,\" yeah right.

But now they go, you know, they got into hot water with the Chinese because they were the ones that funded most of it and they didn't show the hotel they were supposed to show; they didn't show the building they were supposed to show. Like, they upped so they had to make goods go back, reshoot stuff, make sure like the CG was different - things like that. Um, so I mean, it's a crazy world that we live out there. But that's that's kind of always the way it's been. I mean, I I can't blame people if we had a successful product, I would want to keep making that because it's easier to iterate than it is to create right?

Fang is a great designer, you know, but anyway, yeah, that's totally right on where do you look, and it's similar with the pacing. You know, like if you saw the Lego Movie, right?
