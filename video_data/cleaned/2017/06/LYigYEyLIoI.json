Now I'd like to introduce one of our leaders in the Xbox engineering team responsible for making the Xbox One experience great for gamers and developers. Please welcome my friend, Phil Spencer. It's an honor to be here at E3 and represent 3 years of engineering the team has done to bring you Xbox One X from the beginning. Our focus on game creators and you, the gamer, gave us three big goals we needed to hit: power, compatibility, and craftsmanship. Let's talk power, which starts with the specs. I love power - six tera-flop GPU clocked at 1 GHz, 12 GB of GDDR5 memory, and 326 GB per second of memory bandwidth. Damn, dog! There was one dude in the crowd... yeah, I work at Circuit City; I know what this is. These are impressive numbers that are more powerful than any other console on every dimension because that's what it takes to give gamers a great experience.",

Good anti-aliasing and volumetric fog. Even if you haven't made the jump to a 4K TV yet, oh we design this product for you as well. Since Xbox One X enables a technique called super sampling, the new 4k games you see on stage today will look better on your 1080p TV than anything you've seen before. And finally, craftsmanship: we meticulously detail of design as we crafted our most technically Advanced console can use it as a jet ski. It starts with the Scorpio engine; we use 16 nanometer technology, 0. mm chip with 7 billion transistors and a 384-bit wide memory bus. This is the fastest most advanced processor to ever power a console. Our premium design means that every millimeter and every component within the console has been architected for maximum power.",

The Scorpio engine is so intense that for the first time ever on a console, we're using a liquid-cooled vapor chamber, normally reserved for servers and high-end PC cards. I just picture them like all their business cards have 'AER' on the Xbox Hardware team. We've designed a new power management system, so innovative we named it after him - the Hobin method. Uniquely, it optimizes every single Xbox One X at the system and component level to deliver consistent performance efficiently and elegantly. Now, it's easy to think all this technology and capability will mean a bigger console, but again, we wanted more. We wanted more... Hell yeah!

Racing is more immersive and dynamic; ominous skies roll in as car parts rattle and vibrate. We've made racing more epic and grand: race through living environments featuring spectacular vistas and massive scale. You can see we've made racing more dynamic and surprising. Dynamic weather effects grow as the storm unleashes its fury - it's more thrilling and competitive.

At last a day dawned and we rose with this first light, but that light was a betrayal - only fleet in its wake. The night returns... Ain't got no eyes, that's how they're going to get killed, man.

We introduced a way to create unique personal stories for every player, and in Shadow of War we're expanding the Nemesis system. Two new features we're really excited about are forging an army of followers and Nemesis fortresses. Here we'll use the Ring of Power and recruit this Olog-hai broster Chopper to expand our army.

But we can take advantage of his abilities during the Fortress assault. You take out the Overlord, but before we charge headfirst into battle, we should plan our attack and select our followers. Apparently, Matt Mercer is one of the Orcs - that's cool. Who my black? The other actually look very floaty and weird, which is a pain in the ass.
