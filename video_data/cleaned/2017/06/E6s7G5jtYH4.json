From what you saw, is it more classic Uncharted or does this look like Uncharted 4? I didn't like that's a great point. I remember when we were watching that demo and it was pulled in tight for that walking segment when uh Chloe was shrouded, and this one didn't give me that vibe at all. This one gave me straight up Uncharted 4 again, where it's like you know they were crawling doing this thing, they jumped, they slid down the you know the mud or whatever off to the side and did that crazy ass tank car showed up again and was chasing them for a while. But I like that it was playing with expectations of what you expect out of these right where it was the okay you take that per oh no okay you got him, that's great. And then there was another one where at the very end before it cut",
