Wait now we've never met, sir. We...we actually might have met. I'm gonna throw you under the bus right now. No, it's fine. Okay, it's okay that you don't remember when did we meet? Past III. I was a lead designer on a game for Sony called Warriors Lair for the Vita. I think we might have interviewed me very briefly. What...well now let me forget out of this interview taking a completely different turn. I'd like to cut our Warriors Lair for you one person did what is it was going to be Diablo on the Vita.

Ok so how does this happen? How do I... I'm unfamiliar with Dec 9. What else have you worked on so Dec 9 Games is a set of veteran developers we've been building a team actually for the last three years and a set of tools to make cinematic adventure games. Okay, so we brought in storytellers from film and television as well as video games made a great team of storytellers and we made a toolset that really unleashes those people and lets them bring their creative vision into the game. Yeah, and we just had Square Enix come to us and start talking to us about cinematic adventure games next thing we know we're making the next Life is Strange game. We couldn't believe it. We wanted to play the next game, we didn't... ha ha ha ha. So I mean, I say it's all quite often, I know how to play video games and talk.\"",

So then what was the mandate from them or the order I guess they put in - is it like hey we want you to make a Life is Strange game that's before Life is Strange, or do they leave it up to you? Or well we knew that fans wanted to return to Arcadia Bay and there are a lot of fans who just wanted to spend more time with characters that they that they knew and that they loved from the first game. So other than that Square Enix gave us a lot of latitude to compare a lot of different stories, wow, and where we landed was Chloe as our protagonist and telling this story that's really about that special person that just comes into your life at the right time and just changes everything for you, and for Chloe that's Rachel.

Kind of a paradox there of exploring who she is at least through the lens of Chloe and seeing Rachel through Chloe's eyes given what she said about Rachel was really really really appealing to us sure so yeah I mean there's so many other things about Chloe that also were really interesting partly how different she is from Max right sure she's a little spiky, she's got a lot of attitude. Max is very timid and cautious and that just really appealed to us too we think it brings an all new tone to the game so I understand story forage you're talking about how great the Macan of the tools are what makes them special what makes them stand out well it really has it really has two parts it starts in a tool we call play right and",

It starts in a tool we call Playright and that's like letting our writers basically write a screenplay. Yeah, except they can also add in all those branches and consequences and all those moments that make the game play what it is. They build that straight into that screenplay. Then we suck that over into a game of a tool we call Storyteller where we start to build our cinematic sequences. That's like a giant timeline. You bring in a character, you give it animations, you get in there and do the facial expressions. We literally have sliders which you can grab and turn up the sadness and turn down the surprise or mix them however you want to. It's just a great basis for the smiley face or the spider \u2013 you go somewhere between literally that's what we do. Yeah, Wow okay that's interesting were you worried",
