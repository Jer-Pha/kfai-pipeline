They're just mailing it in; they're not, you know, going to give you a quality steak experience right. Two of my favorite steakhouses, real steakhouses in the city, are Eddie V's and Mastro's, and they are insanely expensive. I can only go there maybe once a year if I'm on someone's PR budget or if I'm going with like someone who's like, \"Hey, let's go on the company dime.\" I'm like, great, I'm in; I'm totally in.

The big difference is the critical and audience reaction to the two films also Batman v Superman was stupid - I just said that part, I know if you guys are still paying attention. Okay, no, I was saying while Dawn of Justice opened well, the savage reviews it received have hurt its performance overall, while Wonder Woman has been highly praised by critics. I don't think we have to be wishy-washy on this one; I'm pretty sure the fact that everyone paid to see that movie actually did hurt its performance also the fact that Wonder Woman was just a better film - it's just a better put together movie, so kudos",
