I've always wondered when you see a movie that costs hundreds of millions dollars and doesn't do that money back in the box office why people didn't go see that movie. Okay. So, what I want to do with you guys right now and um is watch the the official trailer for King Arthur, which is a movie that came out starring Jude Law, Charlie Hunnam, and directed by Guy Ritchie. And this movie came out and it did not do well. Gotcha. It by I don't I hate to use the word bombed, but it it it bombed. Um I can pull up the actual official stats for you guys here.

I'm I'm I am not of the mindset with the exception of things I'm super into like obviously superheroes and stuff like I'm not like, \"Oh man, this genre is so hot right now.\" It goes the opposite where it's like that looks all right, but I'm sure A Game of Thrones is better and I'm not even that big of a A Game of Thrones fan.

Then it's Jude Law. I don't I can't think of another Jude Law. He was in he was in uh Young Pope. He's young. Is that good? I haven't watched it. Who knows? All right. Same idea of like I just Jude Law I know I think right now and he's in Sherlock Holmes which I didn't see. I just know it from trailers. I don't like that time period so I never saw Sherlock Holmes. I like Robert Downey Jr.. Fine. But I like him in Iron Man. But it's like I think you'd really like it. There's few actors that actually get me to **** go and I'm going to go see that picture.

They put up just a picture of Baywatch and then they just put up The Rock and everyone's like this throwing like people are doing the you know 80s 90s stuff.
