What is your what you - a lot of them were the Worldwide Studios games you're in charge of these people at the top of the pyramid actually? That was really intentional, yeah. Um, like Grand Turismo Sport coming 2017, go to war coming early 2018 because um we had uh announced uh release dates of many games that we had to apologize and push back in the past so we got together um and this discussed seriously. Because the PS4 games are so big and uh all the teams you know very veteran teams making games for the last 20 years still mis-calculate how much work is done at the very last part of the development being you know polishing or debugging uh, so we agreed to not to announce a release date until very very very close to the release date.
