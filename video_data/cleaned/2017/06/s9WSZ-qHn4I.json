It's a good song. I don't care what Tim says. I don't know. Tim's a fool. He's a fool. Today we're joined by YouTube sensation Alexis Pence and her husband Hunter Pence. Never heard of San Francisco. Yay. If you've never watched a Kinda Funny Reacts to a movie, the rules are simple: We will go spoiler-free. Tell you all about the movie but without spoiling anything. If we thought it was good, if we thought it was bad, then at one point we'll say, \"All right, it's time to get spoilery. We'll give you two seconds and then we'll get into the spoilers.\" So, spoiler-free. Alexis, thank you. I was chewing ice and you're the worst. I'm going to try my best to be spoiler-free. I'm the worst at this game. Kevin's coming. I'm the worst at this game. So, I'll try my best. What did you think",

She held the movie like she was perfect. I don't even remember anyone else. Chris Pine, he did a great job. I thought they had good really good chemistry. Yeah. And that was one of the things I was talking about when we were walking back to the car. So I'm like I can forgive a lot in a movie. Not that there's much that needs to be forgiven here, but with Thor, for instance, it's like it's not not the best superhero movie ever made, but I really liked Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman. And in this, I thought they had good chemistry.

There were some fight scenes like I felt like a connection to like other movies that I've seen all put together into this. There were like Matrixy fight scenes and there were Gladiator fight scenes and um some artsy fight scenes. So like to me uh as far as these movies go, I'm not looking to like change my life, but I was highly entertained and I was like it was better than I expected. Okay.

You know, I would put it above Man of Steel and I would say especially because for an origin story, this I thought made sense for who Wonder Woman becomes, who she is throughout the movie, her motivations.

I loved the gender swap of the Superman movie scene. remember this from when like and it's really obvious of when you know how she blocks the bullet for him. Mhm. It's Oh, right. when he when he's about to get robbed. It's not frame for frame or anything, but it's literally they took the same framing from when in Superman the movie the gun comes out from behind a building and he goes, \"Come over here to Lois Lane and Clark and brings him into the alley.\" And the same thing happened here with the gun coming out and then instead of Clark grabbing the bullet, it was her blocking the bullet with her thing.

That's all I took away from I also think that the fact that there was a female there too when she looked into her eyes even though the chemistry Yeah. Right.
