I'm like, \"Work.\" We're currently at this like 50/50 split on Tumblr right now, and kind of tag it's like half people photoshopping him naked and then half people making video game jokes, yeah, like a perfect 50/50 split right now for me. It happened so quietly; I attended to pay attention but four years ago I went to do it. It was Greg Miller, Elvis impersonator in Vegas, Greg Miller lock-picking for beginners, and then slowly cracked my way up to like now I just dominate how the other Greg incorporated those skillsets into you know?

It's kind of a direct result of you believing that no one was watching during work right? We were watching; we were doing the Kinda Funny morning show with me and Andy Cortes, and what happened is Nick Scarpino as course **** everything up, and he got sick and went home. So Andy stepped in, but that meant I needed a host co-host for GOG as well because we had Jared Petty coming on, and I was like, 'Chat, let me know realistic suggestions.' Because chat, I love the tweets that are always like, 'Hey, have you ever thought about having Tom Hanks on?' And I'm like, 'Oh no, it's never occurred to me; he'd be made for a podcast.'

I guess my number one thing, and the thing that's like most exciting and interesting to me from the key art and everything else is like the vibe that this game seems to be putting out is some like adult quasi-Christian religious cult yeah maybe weird racist undertones thing going on, and I'm like that to me is really exciting because it's so so so so so risky for a series and again maybe a company that's not always the riskiest.

So the point that like you go in there and now you're on that side, and you need help getting out, you have to find people inside who are similar to games to take these people down, and do it with different stuff. And so it's the idea around their money - yeah, there's the cult leader Joseph; he's the father, then he's got his father being the priest, then his brothers Jacob and John, and then the half-sister Faith.
