This, this is the one where I'm going to turn heads and I'm going to be right on a lot of this okay uh guess what's going to happen. The developers from Supermassive will come out on stage and announce their next game and it will have a window of Xbox exclusivity. These are the Until Dawn guys yeah is it a sequel to Until Dawn though? No, new IP, new game we're coming out. We want oh no Sony owns Until Dawn. Oh Dawn go to the PlayStation conference that's a **** game that I want to see I'm on too how about this though Supermassive they said earlier that you know like a year ago they wanted they wanted to go multiplatform they wanted to reach more people. I think this is their chance to do it. I think Xbox has the money to throw behind it be like hey guys we're the ones who brought you on Until Dawn or the horror game so many people like",

Okay what do you guys think is going be called? I think that's a nice guess, I think they're already using Elite for their um, oh yeah, the controllers right right, which is why I think it makes sense and especially the 360 Elite there's legacy with it. Um, I think you're wrong about that $400 price point because it makes makes it like that, I mean I just think you're wrong uh but I think um yeah it's we're going to get a name it's not going to be called Scorpio we're going to get an official all right name yeah to be fair I think that you're 450 makes a lot more sense",

But I I wouldn't have thought of 450 and I didn't want to change mine so I'm sticking to what the prediction says cuz I'm a fair player, but I 450 it sounds like such a weird number to put out there, but I think that 449 yeah okay okay you're right, I do think that it's going to be like my real safe predictions that but it's under 500 because or else I think they're shooting themselves in the foot in a way that they can't all right. So are you copying my prediction? No, I'm sticking to the 400 for the that was real price right right it's like do I want to get in on this train or do I want because I have Scorpio prediction right but I had six here I think a lot of them are really good\"",

Where, like, I don't know if they have that really rich stuff so I think they're going to announce in some form three new IPs, wow, coming from yeah and in some sort of way. They have a lot of studios still working on stuff like new franchises or games within an existing franchise. I don't want to rule out the idea that they might reimagine a franchise that came out 15 years ago in some way but, like, I think oh they will right but I think they'll but I think there will be you know non-sequel exclusive games announced for the Xbox One but, like, a lot of them, like three at least three at least yeah okay yeah interesting. I was also gonna say as well I was also gonna say I wasna say a new AAA IP is announced um because I need one but um instead so I'm I'm toying with the idea I have two I have two I like this so I'm just going to say then if it's taking one of yours let me know okay it won't the first one.",

You've heard like there's a historic legacy to it, that even if you don't know that we should do a Twitter right now and see how many people have heard of Perfect Dark. The argument I would make is that there's so many people that even if they didn't hear about it the moment that they heard about it and everyone else is making a big deal, they're going to be like \"Oh man\" and they're going to fake and act like they were burned by that - because of the 360 Perfect Dark and then the other Perfect Dark that was... it was so you were burned by both of them. Is what you're saying? Perfect Dark one was awesome to me. Perfect Dark was one of those games that, like, people who didn't own a PC thought was good, like crazy - that's like \"Oh my God, it was like Perfect Dark.\" The problem was it was just trying...

Alright, now that we're done with the predictions on Xbox is there any last statements on Xbox? Yes, I think we'll hear about more about the Xbox Game Pass. Oh, that's a cool thing.
