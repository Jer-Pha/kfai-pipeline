So, is that like the hub? Is there a hub world in this? Or yeah, The Odyssey acts as Mario's hub. Um, you can actually change his costumes, uh, like his hats and his outfits. And there you go, he just did one of the capture moves using Cappy. Oh god, oh you got hit down for a second. So I just throw it at him, yeah, there you go. And now your Bullet Bill mustache and all boom see. But I I can't go up though? Correct. And you can only do it for a limited amount of time, so you try to figure out ways you can make use of him here. Oh, there we go. Oh nice, good old Mario 64 spin. I love that. Love it. Little tricky platform in here, yeah got some of the plumes of sand here jump across didn't think I was going to make it did you? I did all right. So this is one of the really cool features.\"",

So this is one of the really cool features of Super Mario Odyssey - these murals you're going to find these murals and you can actually jump into them and it becomes classic. I saw him in a sombrero when he went in here. Where do I get my sombrero? So you can change your costumes at one of two places back on the Odyssey or you can go visit the Crazy Cap store and you can purchase new outfits and caps. Or uh, we actually in this demo, we actually provided you with some costumes. Can I change? Yeah, you can totally do that. Actually bring up the map again by hitting minus and then you you can actually pull it down and go back to the Odyssey if you want. There you go. Just press a... We'll head up. Boom! I'm getting some brood up ladies and gentlemen, let's go. So if you want the Serena outfit we're going to actually have to purchase it but if you",

There's a closet to your right; open it up, just press the 'A' button really quickly. And so we got the Explorer hat and suit. So I need to wear where do I buy it then? So go ahead and step out, and then uh, you'll go straight ahead and you'll see the shop to your left - okay, can't miss it. See head there you go right into the town, and you see the Crazy Cap store right there, where that door is. Roll over there, y'look at that! Okay, all right. So go ahead and talk to that guy; get my sombrero, yes, is what I wanted. Very excited about this - yeah, not at all. All right, you're practicing, and there you go, Mario in a sombrero. Big fan of it, so what does the sombrero do? So the sombrero really doesn't gain any abilities with it; you don't... you don't have anything new, uh, other than it looks\"",
