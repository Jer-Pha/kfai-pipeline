I actually have a side white spider business if you guys want to buy some white... White SP white spider sounds awesome. So my favorite thing is uh so Brian, the creative director on the game, his passion was so obvious \u2013 not just from him talking about the game but showing it in just every little detail how stoked and hyped he was for how Spider-Man it looked and felt like you can just see looking at this; you're like, oh man, they nailed it. Like within 5 seconds, you're like, they got it right. Yeah, Brian and the team at Insomniac are incredible \u2013 they're all super passionate about, and then from day one, just immerse themselves in Spider-Man.

I've been lucky enough to be working with Marvel in publishing since the early 90s. I started writing for Marvel Age magazine, and then I joined the staff and became a copywriter. Then I started writing comics, then started editing comics. Had that long run. And uh, Bill's being modest; he edited all the Guardians of the Galaxy comics that became the inspiration for the films, yeah. Put that team together, yeah. He did, Bill, right? So I remembered Rocket Raccoon mod when I was 14, and there was that Rocket Raccoon miniseries, and I said, \"I want to bring him back.\" Everyone made fun of me, yeah.

You know, we don't want to rush anything out; we don't want to do Spider-Man the game, which is a game based on the movie, and rush it out for a movie window. That's not what we're about; we're like, let's just make the best Spider-Man game and release it when it's ready. And yeah, think of gaming as it's not a derivative business; it's another pillar of the brand. You know, people you know, the movies come out twice a year, starting three times a year this year. Um, we have our Netflix shows, TV shows that people love to binge and watch.

Um, but games is a very, very important destination now for Marvel storytelling. Marvel fans and the quality you've come to know and love from that Marvel brand right right. We want you to see that Marvel logo on a game package and be like, \"Oh, it's going to be awesome.\" Yeah, seeing Mr. Negative in this game I think is such a huge selling point because that shows that it is not just the Green Goblin story we've seen a million times.

What's a Purple Man and we knew what a Purple Man was and they really put the spotlight on him and elevated him made it so cool and so we thought this is our opportunity to, you know. We're going to have a lot of familiar faces in this game but why not pick a character that we believe in? It's only been in comics for the past five to six years but we believe has a great potential let's put the spotlight on him let's Elevate him and then the world will be like I love Mr. Negative he's awesome which to be clear was not it's not like we for we're like oh this game has to have Mr",

How does how did these partnerships start, you guys? Two and a half years ago, we're bringing Marvel games together; we're only going to put out good stuff.

So hopefully you'll see that fun of fun and humor throughout it all. You guys get it? That's the thing - when I was watching the demo, like yeah, the parts we had seen of \"don't screw this up\" and all that, but there was a part in the behind-closed-doors demo where there was a steel beam on a chain, and they could have fought all the guys and not done it instead you went for that and did that, and hit them all.
