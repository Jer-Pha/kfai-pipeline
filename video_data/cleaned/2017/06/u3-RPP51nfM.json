So, I'd be the plus. James Davis, (16 bits of awesome) says, \"Hey, first time producer, longtime seducer. Bernie uploaded a vlog last month titled How I Stay Motivated. It was very interesting. It discussed the idea of becoming disciplined versus needing emotional motivation, and learning how to work without that emotional trigger.\" My question for you this month is not what keeps you motivated. The question is, how did you gain the discipline to do what you do? As a content creator, I like to hear of the habits and rituals of other creators.

Journalism is all deadlines. You have to hit these. You have to hit this deadline. You have to get this done in this amount of time. You got to turn it around as fast as possible. Go get this.

College was the first time I was like, \"Hey, here's a class and here's an assignment that is giving you the tools to do what you want.\" I found that super liberating, super cool.

It just built me in of like this is a deadline you have to hit so go hit it. And so for us with Kinda Funny it's, you know, the evolution of a journalistic deadline to deadlines at IGN to now our own deadlines and our own schedule, right? I think we have a really good schedule right now in terms of morning show Kinda Funny Games Daily. Then what is it? Tuesday and Thursday we have a podcast. Try to get some let's plays in there. Try to, you know, keep the rest of the business going. Good god, Greg. What was that? There's just so much.

Now granted, there'll be another we're going RTX. There's, you know, there's always another convention there's packs coming up eventually. There's stuff like that that'll get in the way, but feel like for the most part, we're in a better place. And I think having it structured out, knowing how to hit it works, but I think it all just comes from at IGN podcast Beyond was always going to be, you know, in the early days, right? In the early days it was Thursday, then we moved it to Tuesday. I think it actually might have gone it was originally on Tuesdays and PlayStation published on Thursdays.

We hit it. I had a deadline for embargos for reviews. You hit them because you want to get it out. You want to do well. You want to, you know, get as many at the time clicks, readers, whatever. Now, it's views. You want all this stuff. I want to be part of the conversation. I want to lead the conversation. So, I guess that's how that works. It's just I learned how to do it just through repetition, good mentors, um, good classes, knowing where it was all taking me. That was helpful.

I always throw out Kingdom Come which is a whole collection of other superheroes as well obviously but it's anchored around Superman his journeys.

I've debated it before at length, especially going to, you know, growing up going to Catholic school from K through 12 grade 12th grade.

Maybe this isn't, you know, maybe it's just my story. I'm in my own little world with a whole bunch of simulation AI. And the reason I always bring it up that I think is weird is because I've had it on multiple times and it hasn't happened in a long time, but multiple times where I'd be growing, I'm like, \"Oh man, I'm having d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\" And somebody be like, \"Well, what's that?\" I",

You know what I mean? But then it was do this kind of grunt, do that kind of grunt. And I was like, \"I don't\" And I do it and he's like, \"No, like this.\" He just did things and then I passed them back to him at some point. He could have done the whole video game himself in much less time, but he did it for me. So basically go in there, you're going to feel like an idiot if you're like Greg Miller, but who cares? Just do it. Get it done. Nicole Humphrey is the final question for this AMA and says, \"Greg, can you tell us the origin of 'If I'm lying, I'm dying'? I keep up with most Kinda Funny content, but the origin of this particular line seems to have eluded me. It comes from the Grandma Miller raccoon story, right?\" Yeah, I think so. That's the first time I say it and I say it like 50 times and Colin's finally",

He once told me the story Kevin and I've never been able to verify because I've never looked into it. But he's telling me about on a job site where they were making instant mashed potatoes, but they were working outside or whatever that this guy would come by every so often and grab a handful of instant mashed potatoes and eat",

Not sure if that's true. That doesn't sound right. It sounds like a very unclean work facility of my dad, the construction worker, had a construction worker friend who walked through a mash instant mashed potato factory and was just putting his hand into wherever. Like what? That doesn't check out. Like was he also drinking milk? cuz you need to like add milk to that. Well, it's a liquid inside you. No. Also, why would you eat powder? You know what I mean? A lot of things don't check out this story. But if you've watched the GOG episode exclusive with my father, he's also the guy who's like, \"Oh, I got knocked out for how long? A week and a half. That's a coma.\" So, I'm sure with knowing my father, I'm sure he missed a",

Like in the teens, probably, you know, like a baby. But that's the origin. If I'm lying, I'm dying. I kind of made it up. But it kind of feels like something my father would say. I don't know if he has because if he had if he had said he would have said it since then and if so then I would have like been and like he wouldn't have gotten what that meant. Ladies and gentlemen, this is I've held it in an entire show. Kevin, you're so close. I can't do it any longer. You were one sentence. I couldn't do any longer.
