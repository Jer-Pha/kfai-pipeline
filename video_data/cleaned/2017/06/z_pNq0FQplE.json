Others said every mother's day, and he was talking about how he's grown up with it now and like he's trying to not be as controlling, and that this god of war is trying to allow the players to play how they want to play, and his whole thing is like you try to reassemble as much of the original God of War team as possible to come back, obviously way older now, and be like what has God of War become to us now, and how sweet it kind of tries to relinquish the control of everything being exactly how we want it, yeah, to players, and letting them kind of have their own input on what... oh yeah, okay, that was really exciting. What did you see one behind closed doors? What is different so speed in a control thing like he still is a very controlling dude; he didn't want it to be seen.",

The game looks very far along, oh yeah yeah like it well it's early 2018, I'm expecting pretty pretty damn January February ah yeah yeah it's like it definitely seems super super ready man like they said this last year but the entire game takes place in one continuous camera time and he was talking about Kratos and there's no no cutting around at all the camera is always just into one shot with gameplay or cut scenes or all of that yeah and what what's exciting about that is you saw about video games are finally at a point where technically they've gotten accomplished what they see in there oh well I wasn't trying to do",

But I out of the is like now we're giving the players control of the rage, so you can jump right in and use your rage, but anytime you want that might not be the best choice for whatever you're doing. The action in combat is a lot more like from seeing in the trailer, it's a lot more deliberate, and yeah, it's less button mashing RKT, and it seems more like alright, what's the best way to kind of go about the situation? One of those really cool things is there's actually a button for the Kratos' rage meter, and it's thinking said that finger made me really happy. He's just like I know a lot of people think this is going to be a giant escort mission, yeah, it's not at all. There's no point where the kid is vulnerable later on in trouble and like you need to worry about him dying, and laughing like they showed at the conference with the kid jumping on a stabbing arm shooting arrows and through this like, yeah, it's not one of those situations.",

Oh any examples of the type of world he wants to build okay where there's a lot of times that you see something like The NeverEnding Story where they'll be like these big monsters is like you think took their back but they're actually it could be your friend and we saw that in the trailer that we saw at PlayStation, yeah we're talking about that big world surfing where it came up and like you're stuck that's the ball, God of War, but he's actually the homie.

Yeah, well I serve a man I don't know said very good. I said he's always we'll have to see on, but it seems like that was kind of taking what you expect from out of War incident on Ted a bit. Where I as you go through the game just a lot of things that are similar but different. I think a lot of has to do with the fact that it's no longer the Greek mythology we're moving into the Norseman. Yeah, yeah he was talking a lot about how all the gods are essentially politicians and that when you think about it there's a whole world going on and there's just the different countries the different areas and have their own rules that are decided by the gods but the creative has had influence in all of them something like okay gods do govern all the areas in the world. And he really likes using this was not so much a reboot as much as a continuation, but a great jumping on point for new.\n\nI corrected phonetic mistakes and spelling errors, especially for names and pop culture references, while keeping the original meaning, slang, and grammar intact. I also capitalized proper nouns like \"God of War\" and \"Norseman\".",
