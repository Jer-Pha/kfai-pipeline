It's just like, whatever man... Like I feel great about this show, all due respect, E3 will be what it is. E3, in the Behemoth, it is. E3 is a known quantity. You look at the E3 schedule and you're like, 'All right, we're streaming.' They've spread the streams out, which a lot of people are annoyed about because they have to go to LA earlier. We're just streaming from home. It's like I get to come in, I get to be well-rested, do nothing, go home next day, do two more, do two more, do one more, fly to LA... I've blown all of Tuesday, then it's Wednesday, go see some games, do the GameSpot live stream, that's go to bed, well, party but go to bed, then eventually Thursday wake up, see some more games, go.\"",

Well, that's the other thing too: is right? We're we're as a group, as Kinda Funny, and on a as Kinda Funny Games, like we figured out how to do E3 a little bit more efficiently, which I think is cool. That gives me less anxiety. And B, we've got a bigger team; sure, so we've got more people, more hands to help, more defined roles, which is good. Which means that I can just kind of my scope of work for the show is a lot more defined, which again helps with my just like feeling of dread going into it.

Yeah, it's like when we partnered with Rooster Teeth, that was the first time a lot of people thought... which was back in March of last year.
