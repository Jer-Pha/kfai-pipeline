They're not Owen, this this this might not be those look like those gonna be stormtroopers actually because if they are there they're reflective more see like could be it could be brand new brand of tar people but we don't know work at some point going to see more of the nights around back sorry which is cool huh.

But that last shot and that last moment of dialogue... and I'm like, \"it has me really wondering yeah are we gonna take this in a whole new direction?\" Yeah is are the Jedi done? Is this going to be something else, like there's no more Jedi, there's no more Sith. Yeah, we're just like, force warriors or Knights or something... whatever the hell you're gonna call him now. And that's interesting to me and that's really cool and that's a nice evolution in my brain of what these new movies could potentially mean for everyone.

There was the first time I think it was, yeah. So but what I like about this is I feel like they have a lot of restraint when it comes to that stuff in terms of the visuals. Because I don't need to know everything began and I think that's what led to episode 7 being what it was in terms of criticism from people of like \"all was too much the same.\" Because when we watch the teasers, we all went crazy with like \"whole thing can I do this,\" they're gonna show this, I'm gonna do that based on what we saw online.

Talk about like when they were originally in the new trilogy 1, 2 & 3, they talk about and how Anakin is fulfilling this prophecy about bringing balance back to the Force. But in reality, you know what they were trying to angle for is like they want the Force to be heavily unbalanced; they want a bunch of Jedi I had no Sith and so the concept of them evening it out and having his line, his bloodline, having been the one responsible for actually saying, \"No, this is what it's going to be about. Now we embrace the light and the dark, and one thing we move forward.\" I think that's really fascinating to me. Yeah, I also could be completely and totally reading way more into that than I think you're right; then we are. I think that's what it is.
