Sub tweets are the practice of passively aggressively tweeting about someone else while not mentioning them by name or username. I'm very familiar with it; that's usually reserved for friendship-ending fights or call-out posts, but in this game sub tweets are all about love \u2013 some sweet, nasty love. In the sub tweet game, you play as a Twitter user scrolling through your timeline and doing out faves to your preferred tweeter, the other user. The other users all have distinct personalities: one's incredibly horny, Nick; one is cranky, Colin; I was complaining about one of them being a bot, and they react to your face and interact with each other. Kevin is the bot. The game is short, and the gameplay isn't too tricky to figure out \u2013 just like in life, you have to fave the object of your affection as much as you can.",
