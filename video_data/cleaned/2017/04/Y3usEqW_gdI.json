Yeah, I think six months before, three months before - I don't even remember, it was so long ago, it felt like it wasn't, it felt like there wasn't that long between the two, but maybe maybe there was. But so that's the other thing, Smash Bros., yep, man. So I don't see it coming this year, so I would hope, but they tend to announce a new Super Smash Bros. game pretty far in advance, so I do think they may show it off at E3. I don't think it's coming this year though - we're already getting three big multiplayer games this year in the forms of Mario Kart, Arms, and Splatoon 2. I don't think they could unload their last biggest multiplayer game in the same year. Do you think that it's a port? Though, I think it's a port, I think, well, I say that loosely - I think it's going to be a port in the same vein as the 3DS and Wii U versions; it's going to be a port of the Wii U version.",

Absolutely, it's true, yeah, that's a good point, and I do think it's small enough though that they can just make, make more, like, make a sequel, and like, I mean, kind of like Splatoon 2, where it's just, it, everyone thought it was a port, and is it a port? No, it's a new game, but it's like, really, it's not like that much of an increase, right, and I think Captain Toad can be the same thing, but so we're dealing with all the ports, we're running out of things that I think that they would port on Wii U, besides Smash Mario Maker, and that's probably it, that's, I mean, that's a big question, right, like they're, they're already",

We think it'll sell Splatoon one. I think it's that the fact that you have loyal Nintendo fans like me right who actually feel a connection to the system for the first time since I guess 64 really. And it's like, I didn't give Splatoon the time of day on Wii U because I did not like my Wii U but I heard Fran never shuts up about it; she loves it and so like it's coming out, I'm like well yeah there's not that much going on there's other games don't get me wrong. But like this is a trip Nintendo one so yeah I'll play this on a plane I'll see what the hell is all about. And and that's that's kind of uh what I keep going back to is I do feel like with the Switch and like yesterday or last week on The Gamecast with Greg, when we were looking at all the Wii U top selling titles",

Uh, when we were looking at all the Wii U top-selling titles, it was interesting to know that 13 million Wii U sold, and the top 10 there was so many that were like above 2 million sold, which is a great attach rate when you compare it to a system like the PS4 that sells way, way more, but its top-selling games aren't you know statistically near the same thing. And I wonder if the Switch can kind of pull that off on a bigger scale and if their release schedule is less dry than the Wii U was, then I think that a lot of people will be like, \"You know what? I'm going to give ARMS a shot; buy ARMS, I'm also going to buy Splatoon,\" and that adoption rate could just stay. That's the thing \u2013 it's the exact same argument every everybody made and I made and developers made about the Vita: people who owned the Vita bought Vita games.",

And then, that's without - I mean I'm talking about the end of its life cycle - without having a AAA game. So to have it be that like every if they can do it like right now it's every week it seems like there's another great indie game out... even if that tapers off and slows down, it's still going to be enough that you're turning on your Switch, you're thinking about your Switch, you're packing your Switch. And then yeah, it's going to be that good - yeah, Arms is that why not?

The thing is though, for me, I always liked a little bit weird because a lot of people like equate those two games together whereas for me, like I thought those two games could be more different at the time really because Mario 64 was truly open - you go into a world, you have like 10 things you can do, go off, do what you want. Sunshine kept the same size of the worlds but gave it to only do one objective at a time so that's where I felt like they started the path down the more linear route they went and to be fair, I ended up loving those games too - Galaxy I love absolutely 3D L 3D world are fine games.",

I know some people are loving that game, I was a little bit let down by it. I had I haven't played it, I mean I've done I've done a Let's Play with Nick and did a Draft House Let's Play watch out, that's right yeah. And so like I think I don't think this is going to have the same problem because I think Breath of the Wild's problem was it was too traditional whereas already having New Donk City and doing these different things I think they're going to understand where they need to take The Legend of Zelda: Galaxy, they need to take 64 and find this middle ground or combine them and make a beautiful baby. I don't think it's going to be the same, the text popping up be like all right well this is exactly what I think they're going to nail how to platform around that City, I think that city is going to be designed that",

It's a jungle gem, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah! I just hope I'm saying this because I'm saying like Mario 64 - one of my favorite games of all time. It is one of the few games that I go back to and play like every couple years, and it is still fun. But when you play through it, there's a lot of things where I'm like, \"Oh man,\" like it is a chore to uh play Rainbow Cruise right? And I try to 100% that level because the camera works so against you. Because that is one of the few platforming levels true in in the whole in in that game and it stands out versus the you know any the Lethal Lava Land or the more like open one, like Um All-Stars land. Yeah, exactly! Exactly! Like so we'll see - very excited.",

And then I think some time between then and now, more immediately, you'll get a Prime on Switch, that either if it's through eShop or if it's some kind of re-release thing. Oh okay, one of the OG ones yeah. So with the interesting thing with the switch being the console and the handheld is that means if they do get rid of the 3DS, there's two markets of games where there's the hand traditionally handheld games and traditionally console games. We're just talking about the console ones. Do you think that we'll get uh a a top down more traditional old school Zelda or a 2D Mario game or a 2D Metroid game? I I think we definitely will the next Zelda, I think will will I think it probably will be a 2D game so because I don't think they can deliver another Breath of Wild style game.",

The next Zelda, I think, will be a 2D game so because I don't think they can deliver another Breath of the Wild-style game anytime soon. And with Zelda, the question is: yeah, I think we'll still get those smaller-scale games like for the 3DS. How do you do they charge full price on those now or do they charge what they would have on 3DS? Like because people are going to compare the next 2D Zelda to Breath of the Wild. Why is it $60 as well when it's I think they'll charge the 3DS prices for this, yeah. And that'll kind of set the tone of what's happening right. Like this is not meant to be Breath of the Wild; this is not meant to be Mario Odyssey. These are games that are smaller experiences. I mean, there's a precedent already with One Switch and Super Bomberman R. It is overpriced but it is you know cheaper than the $60 games so man I'm very excited about this. I hope",
