Now, when I started this, I said I was the best Mario Kart player around - it was just a little jab, I wanted to take a shot and punt into the sun, but guess what, Adam and Josh, you decided to open your fat mouths and get involved too, so now it's all of you. All of you come to twitch.tv/kindafunnygames and try to keep up - my name is Greg Miller, and I'm pretty good at Mario Kart now. Don't get me wrong, this isn't going to be an equal opportunity ass beating - any of you Kinda Funny Best Friends want to go to the forums and sign up to play me Friday, April 28th live from 12:30 to 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time - what time is it in Central Time? I don't care. Break your dick off here's the thing - you all show up and we do the grand prix, and we have a great time, but Zigger, you're the one I'm coming for first, you might",

Sean, I'm taking your money, and then of course once Shawn Pitt stood up, little Zigger got up too, and he said, \"Oh let me pull up my diapers.\" I put $50 down as well; I take that bet too, Zigger. I don't think you have that money to give, Zigs, and I'm going to take it from you because my name is Greg try to keep up Miller, and I'm good at Mario Kart, and I'm good at eating chicken wings, and I'm kind of all right at being a boyfriend, so what are you going to do, Kinda Funny Best Friends, when Greg Miller runs over you.",
