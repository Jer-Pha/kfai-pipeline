This whole thing was like in Spaceballs, their secret handshake, the way they salute. Now tell me about this shirt; I was going to say, \"Tell me about this shirt.\" I like this shirt; it's an Invincible shirt. I freaked out on uh this show when they announced the Invincible movie and they sent me this shirt. I got some water spots on it - no, it's great! I was back there making burgers this morning; it's a barbecue day. I was making wings, had some raw juice kicked up on me, but that's just water from what I just did to my hair - no, it's great!

If I think there's too many low points for it to be my favorite movie series. Fair enough, lots of low points there. There's always two Fast and Furious series, really. I was at the worst, I was in such a dark place in my life watching that movie, I wanted to just end it all. Yeah, I know you by that, you mean... of course. I don't think we eat as much as we think we do. F&SF sure, sure, metaphorically take out the Blu-ray and just... it's it's good. I liked part four a lot more than I think a lot of people did. Five was really good, and six was awesome. Six was awesome, six was great. That's funny.
