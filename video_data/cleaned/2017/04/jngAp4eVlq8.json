Silver Sable Black Cat, I will be incredibly surprised if that happens. I would too; that sounds like some of the stuff you talk about, like when DC is off in the weeds about their movies they're going to make anyway uh but Marvel is involved with those. We had a very particular plan about Spider-Man himself, Fe explained when asked why Marvel wasn't involved in Sony's projects for those characters although he kept those plans to himself; he talks a little bit about James Gunn coming for Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and working on that then then he has this one that we've been talking about on the show a lot, the whole Josh Brolin Thanos Cable stuff uh the geek world was abuzz last week when it was confirmed that Josh Brolin, who plays Avengers: Infinity War villain Thanos, has been cast as Cable in Fox's Deadpool 2; quote \"we don't have\"",

Quote, \"We don't have anything written into our contracts about other roles that people can do,\" said Feige when asked about the issue. Indiana Jones and Han Solo are the same person; it hasn't been a problem, and I think Thanos and Cable are two very different characters. Interesting. Feige has no plans for an R-rated movie; he talks about \"I'll just read the quote for that because what he said before,\" but it's still interesting. My takeaway from both those films he's talking about Deadpool and Logan is not the R rating, it's the risk they took, the chances they took, the creative boundaries they pushed, that should be the takeaway for everybody. Uh, Marvel hasn't had to change; humor is key, sure, and that's that, those are the interesting tidbits all over on The Hollywood Reporter of course IGN Stax was over there, he did a whole bunch of stuff.",
