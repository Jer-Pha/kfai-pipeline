I'm like, okay, that's better. But yes, I'm not going to lie after the first maybe five minutes of it, I'm like, ah no, I'm good, I'm good. So here's the nuts and bolts of it; the takeaway from this game: are you going to play it when it comes out? Like, are you into doing it that much? I think I will. Okay, yeah, I mean obviously depends on what's happening around April 11th, um, and where I'm at because I'm excited about a lot of other games.
