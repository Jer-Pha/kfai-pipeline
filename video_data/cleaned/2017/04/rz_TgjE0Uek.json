Like, I still love my Vita. I have not taken the dock out of the box yet. Like, I have only played this thing in handheld mode as though it's like a Vita. Nick's the same way, too. I treat it like a portable system. I mean, 95% of that's how I've played it, too. Kevin, have you played with it attached to a TV? Wait, hold on. Kevin's going to throw a bunch of switches, turn on his microphone, make sure it's working. I have not. No, no, no, I haven't at all, actually. I just play the way to be while Paul is sleeping or I I would say that I'm I'm maybe 60-40 portable 40 on TV. Yeah, I probably have put a grand total on a TV. Well, I guess",

God, it's so good. No, I love it. BW I've beaten The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild since the last games, guys. I'm putting it off. So, I have 118 shrines. What? Yeah, I have uh I'm like taking my time. I'm so weird. Like, I play it so backwards. I unlocked the full map before I ever even went to Kakariko Village.

Yeah, you're you're pretty close. My thing with the reason that I play so much with the TV is I like the Pro Controller so much that it's not really comfortable playing the Pro Controller on the little screen, especially when I have a 65 in TV. So, I'm like, why wouldn't I just do this? Yeah. And the Pro, it's funny because like I I think when more games are out for it, like I've played at work and at events and stuff, I've played other games that are great and like I I like Shovel Knight is incredible. I can't recommend that game enough. And like Snake Pass seems really cool and and have you played the Shovel Knight Spectre of Torment? I haven't yet. No, it's",

Like I've just been like I've been hearing him talk about all this stuff forever and we played me and Colin did a let's play of the uh um Plague Knight DLC. I forgot what that was called but it was just like you just play as a new character. You have different abilities but it's the same game. Well that's yach club is like this has to be the most generous like they are cuz there are some Kickstarters I backed like I still haven't gotten the physical stuff from my Mighty No. 9 pledge like 2013 but then like shovel is the opposite.

And now they have the new Treasure Trove or whatever. Yeah. And so Yacht Club Games has everything for all of it, which is awesome. And there's there's still more. The King Knight one's coming out later, too. But playing the Plague Knight one, I didn't like it. Didn't like how he played and I was like, I already played the game. I I don't need to do this again. Uh but this one for for Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment, first off, my favorite of the nights. Second off, it's a prequel to Shovel Knight, and it's uh it's reminds me of Super Mario Galaxy 2 from one where there's no more world map. It's just you just choose the levels and and go to it, but they're the same style of level. It's just they're totally remixed to play",

Oh man, I'm blown away by how much they put into this game that's free for people who bought it years ago on any platform. You're making me want to play it. So, it's like Yeah, it's so good. It's exclusive to Switch right now, but it's a timed exclusive. It'll be on everything else soon. Trouble came too. Yeah. I mean, I'm in that boat where I think I'll start playing on my TV when other stuff comes out, cuz like Zelda I'm playing in a very specific way where I set myself a little micro-adventure every night and give myself an arbitrary goal to do it - find a Shrine or whatever it is. Um I think other games I'll want it on my TV again. Um it's also like I'm",

Graceful explosion machine shout out by the way. Have you been playing it? Yeah. I'm still super into its event. I'm bummed that I missed the uh global test fire for Splatoon 2. Feel like the times were so weird. That was so weird. Here's 55 minutes to jump in. I'm like what do you want me to do? And then Yeah. Yeah.

Um, it is my type of game and it just felt it felt wrong. I'm loving Snake Pass. Uh, I do think that that's the type of game that I don't really want to be playing right now. Um, like I feel like I'd rather uh Ukulele come, so I want to give that a shot. Pass is fun, but I just feel like the levels uh they make you they're so well-designed that they make you want to get all of the the coins and stuff and I'm just like I'm finding myself when Gio's watching TV that I'm like I I don't want to focus this much on what I'm doing right now.

But no, I didn't want to get everything, get all these coins and I did all stuff and I got all the stuff and then I fell and died and I came back and I was like, \"Wait.\" And I paused it and I lost everything.

But like when you lose it and have to do it again like that drives me insane. Yeah. Anyway, I've been happy uh with with the Switch so far. Oh, me too. But I want to talk about the accessories and and all that stuff cuz I've been doing a lot of research. I've gotten a whole bunch of **** Some I like, some I don't like. So I want to start with the cases. What case are you using? So on Amazon these things are backordered to hell. So, it's like I was stupid and didn't pre-order a case.

So looked for a case. Everything's backordered like two, three, four, five months. And I finally like I had alert me notices set for like every single case on Amazon. Uh cuz GameStop was sold out, Best Buy was sold out. Finally, Amazon 4 Prime had a um starter kit, like a PDP Starter Kit. So, I have the Lynx Tunic Edition. It is basically the same as that case on the inside, but on the outside, it is this very ugly like baby blue like imitation of his tunic with a bright gold zipper. It's just hideous.

This is just Mine's made by PDP, but it's like almost a PDP version of this. And then the front of it just even uglier, if you can believe it. So, Nintendo I think the Switch is cool.

I like things when they're sleek and a bit more fashionable when it comes to the the cases and stuff. So, when we saw this one, this is the charcoal PDP premium case is what they call it.

The worst thing about it is not only does it not protect **** when you go on the inside Yeah. just everything's going to scratch the screen. Yeah, I'm thinking this the game you're you're telling me that you're going to put it against the actual game carts themselves or against this freaking like this reminds me of like when you go to Ross to buy swim trunks.

But see, this came with a microfiber cloth, so ill give a shout out to them for that. Yeah, that thats a this one. We see we had ordered this one, the charcoal PDP one, and then the problem was it didnt come on time. So, i was walking around with my Switch wrapped up in a t-shirt and then Nintendo sent me this one, the official Nintendo one. And that one is a kickstand, which i think is cool, but it doesnt protect as a kickstand. Yeah. So, like this thing, if you take that out, this one Oh, thats what that is. I've never ever folded it up. You could mount, you could basically do it like that and then keep it. Yeah.

I eventually got in when Amazon had like a quick shipment. I'm like, \"Fuck yeah, I need this thing.\" But I love this case.

So it's backed up to hell. It is $80, so it's also pricey, but it is very much a premium case. And they have a giant one that you can put the dock in and the power brick in.

So, anyway, if you want to sign up for the Razer Power Bank, but there will be other ones coming soon. But the other thing here is like if you can hold out, hold out. Like these battery chargers are only going to get cheaper and Well, that was my thing of like I'll pick this up now. It wasn't that expensive and it was just like I need to charge a million things anyway. You know what I mean? I just put it in my backpack and never think about it. I've I've charged I've charged the battery pack once. I've used it once in the Switch and I still have full power.

Um the last two things I want to talk about are the the Ethernet connector. So, there's no Ethernet port on the the dock itself. And like not that it really matters for anything. Like the Wi-Fi has been fine for me for downloading games, but there hasn't really been a multiplayer game yet. So once Mario Kart and Splatoon come, we'll see how necessary it is. Uh the official one is like ridiculously priced. I think it's like $30. Yeah. Any USB Ethernet cable will work. So if you just go on Amazon, you can get one of those for like $3. I still actually had mine from the Wii. If you have one for the Wii or Wii U, it works totally perfectly. So I do want to give a shout out here to Canaries in the coal mine. I didn't listen to cuz when they announced the Switch and they're like, \"It doesn't have Netflix. It doesn't have this. It doesn't have an internet",

Jump cut to me in my Austin hotel room getting codes for new Switch games. And I'm like, **** yeah. Connect to the hotel internet. Just **** times out cuz there's no window now to pop up and say, \"Oh, hey, are you a shared guest or whatever?\" Hit okay. Put in your room number and other **** And now same terrible. So 3DS had if you have like a MacBook, you connect to a thing and uh Wi-Fi pops up and you type in the password and whatever. Uh on a 3DS you had three saved connections.

So it's frustrating that they didn't learn from that and make hotel Wi-Fi work. Um, man, I've had so many Wi-Fi issues with my Switch. Like I basically have to connect at work. If I have it this far from my router, like 3 inches of my router, it still won't always read it. Um, and if it does, it'll be at one bar cuz apparently it's just really susceptible to interference from other Wi-Fi devices, people were saying. Interesting. I've had a lot of trouble. So I'm definitely going to do hardwired. I've had it. I've had it. It works. It has worked great at home downloading stuff. Games go super quickly. I We have good internet at home.

That's a good And then I had to actually do the thing where you hold the power button down for 15 seconds to like hard reset it. Wow. Kind of sucks, but It's crazy how like in the same way I did when I warm up to my VA, like when I play it, I feel so comfortable with it now. And like I like I I have mine set to like the dark the night mode or whatever. Like and I just I like the menus.

Yeah, I'm glad I have that Ethernet adapter as like a kind of a backup plan. Yeah. And the last accessory to talk about is memory cards, which is one of the most important accessories, but I feel like one of the least important right now just cuz there's nothing to download. Um, but this is going to become a problem sooner than later. Uh, it's another thing like the portable chargers where I would recommend holding out as long as possible cuz the prices drop on them so quickly.

Future proofed. The thing is it comes in different sizes that are worth it right now. There's the 128 which is $44. So, that is the most like you're getting your best bang for your buck in terms of quality, space, and price. Uh the 200 gig one which is a weird price for memory card or a weird number. Yeah, 200. It's $77. So, it's like not too crazy if you really want that much space. Where we're getting crazy is 256 is $242. So, like you can kind of see that threshold and I imagine within a year everything will be pushed down even further. So, that was what I used on my Switch, Nintendo, bless them, never drops the price of their first party games. So, like if you go to buy like a used copy of 3D World, it's often still like $50 $60.

So, I just traded in like my whatever, like 10-15 first-party games and that was enough for me to buy a 256-gig card with credit. So, like I have a 256 gig in my system because I love Nintendo, but I know Nintendo and I was just so paranoid about hey, you can't swap memory cards or it's tied to your profile forever or whatever it ends up being. So, I just wanted high capacity. I can go digital. I can, you know, not worry about losing cartridges and all that stuff. Yeah. No, it's a good call.

Right now, so Zelda I think is uh like 135 somewhere there. And then like Lego City if you wanted it came out today and it's like seven. Um, so it's like it's getting there if you're just using the internal memory. But even then, like the next real thing that isn't just like a a tiny game is going to be Mario Kart and you have, you know, a month into from the time of recording this until that comes out. I think you're going to see micro SD. They said this supports the standard which is up to like two terabytes or something.
