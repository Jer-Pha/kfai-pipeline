Um, what's cool about this game is that are really you make choices that affect the end game but you maybe don't know what those choices are in the moment that you make them which I think is really neat. So you wake up kind of on this space station, you find out that this alien threat called the Typhon have kind of taken over and they mimic things in the world so you could walk into a room and not see an alien but then all of a sudden like your coffee cup will jump at you and start attacking you.

Just how extensive their reach into humanity is, and it's got this really cool like dark suspenseful kind of gritty sci-fi thriller vibe, an Alien: Isolation vibe. Yeah, it's the music is awesome; it's like Drive music that whole opening right in the beginning before you even know where you're in the helicopter, and that soundtrack they play behind you're like, \"Oh my, that was for me.\" When I was like this was... You get powers, and you know, you get to manipulate. I'm sure you did your your let's what you played but like in that first section, they didn't show you any of that, and it was like holy crap, this is so cool; there's so much style.

Yeah, you were getting raw materials right? They showed us this, and once you learn like the recipe for something, you can go there and make this gun because one of the storing Mach we saw early on right yeah was to go through recycled materials to make this key card or whatever it was to get through the door to get over here. Yeah exactly, and then at some point you'll be able to take um the Exotic material that you find in certain areas of the ship and uh create neuromods, and neuromods are what allow you to unlock skill um skills inside the tree, and so you have to kind of make a decision what kind of character do I want to play as",

Yeah, you know? I think they're saving some of that for player discovery, but they did talk to me about this one alien called The Nightmare, that's literally its name. Essentially, if you get to a point where you invest a lot of points into the alien branches, the Typhon are going to recognize that you're doing that and they won't see you as an ally; they'll see you as like a hybrid alien, and they send this thing called The Nightmare to come and execute you, and it's supposed to be like this big bad really scary monster that's sent down to hunt you and like essentially just kill you.",

Um, and the game looks really great; was running really smoothly didn't see any like glitch problems, and I'm really excited for May 5th. Yeah, it's coming real soon, May 5th, so that's like two weeks away from us recording this. Like do you think I'm never going to get Persona down time? That's my problem; I'm never going to get Persona is this the next big game in that sense or do you think this will kind of be like Dishonored was where yeah no it's defin I think it's probably even smaller than Dishonored.

Whereas when you say direct means something, you're saying to The Wider gamer audience, \"direct\" means Fire Emblem and Smash we're going to get a big big thing yeah.

Yeah, it was just so good. My Crash Team Racing I've got to give a shout-out to 'cause I stand by it as the superior kart racing game, but in terms of Mario Kart, I think I might give it to 8.

He wasn't even like he was making contact with another player or anything. And um, we had to go to the emergency room in Boston. The doctor immediately was like, \"Yep, your Achilles has detached.\" Sorry, that doesn't sound fun at all. Um, basically, the test is like so you lay down and then they squeeze the calf muscle of your non-injured leg, and your foot moves like a reflex test. And then they squeeze the calf on his injured leg, and there was no movement. The doctor's like, \"That's not good.\" Got an X-ray; yep, it's fully ruptured. Oh my God! So um, he had to have surgery reconstructive surgery to get it fixed. So he's now in his walking cast and on the road to recovery. And hopefully we'll have his boot off by E3.
