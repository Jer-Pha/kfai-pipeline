Yeah, so I mean like... but but that's the thing, referencing F8 obviously, which is the last one, I guess, and I don't really remember it that much, and unfortunately, I think it's because F8 was a little bit incoherent due to the loss of Paul Walker in the film.

So why would you name your kid after that when although to be fair they're brothers though I can see that like you can't just name someone just cuz someone dies like I'll give it to that how about the Fast and Furious franchise, you better believe the brakes Han was a brother too my friend Han was and Han was there for him. You didn't see Vin Diesel fly to Tokyo just to hang out with Brian no he flew there to avenge Han's death all right and talked to Lucas Black for some reason I don't know why they did that just because you know he was in need what were you doing here in Tokyo?

Everything that came out of his mouth was something that I laughed at pretty much. That's one thing that I was telling Tim about in the vehicle on the drive over here... why did I say vehicle? I don't know why I said that. Um, is that in every other movie I never really felt like Roman was written as well as he could have been. I think in this movie it was everything - everything was funny, everything he said was really funny and he was written really well and I enjoyed the out of his character where in prior movies I was like Tyrese you're trying too hard man.

They introduced their family Dom's actual family with the kid and introducing the idea that the Shaw Brothers have a mom; they're maybe not as bad as you think, and they have their own perspective in their brother's movie - that'd be great. But it's just like I liked that they were really pitting families against each other, and it was still all about the damn families.

I mean, by the end, by the time he put the headphones on the baby, I'm like All Is Forgiven, and for but see just got me, that was a great choice that they did because they really they're like we got to humanize Deckard, we got to make him likable because the scene between him and The Rock didn't do it, no, it was bad. Which is why they need to go back and re-shoot certain movies from the perspective of the bad guy so we know where they're coming from, maybe they are just human and they're doing this because of some other reason, the Cipher I mean, I love it because like if if we get somehow from this a prequel movie that is the Deckard brothers and they actually do have some.",
