You get into tight deadlines, big budgets, lots of risk money, lots of people's uh, uh, even people like you're being supported by a publisher; it's a big moment those people are putting their jobs on the line like they're standing up for you defending you inside a big company, you know, new launch whatever it may be.

You would never do that at a AAA level, that's what SOA publisher level is because you couldn't go from IGN to this, and the fact that YouTube is all about collaboration, you know? As soon as you get into they start telling you about that, but the fact at IGN it was like when I started at IGN, like we wanted to be number one. Like we were behind Gamespot at the time, and then when we all worked our asses off and did it, you were number one, and now we're going to maintain being number one, and we're going to hit every embargo, and we're going to do all this stuff, and it was crushing.",

As long as there was retail, I had to go convince salespeople, buyers at Walmart, \"My game has to be here and not that other person's.\" Right? And then there's cost of goods associated now - there's higher risk, you know more money, more risk, more pressure. That breeds the wrong vibe between us, that makes us want to get more isolated.
