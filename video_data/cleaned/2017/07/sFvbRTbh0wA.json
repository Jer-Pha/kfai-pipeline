Welcome to the Kinda Funny Morning Show. My name is Nick Scarpino. I'll be your host for today's proceedings. With me today is Andy Cortez. Can I just call you Andy? Because a lot of people called you Andy. I could I could see why people would get confused by that, right? Because I think if my name were Andy Cortez, an obvious username would be MaximumCortez. Yeah. Um, but yeah, so at one point I think Gia was talking to Jen about me and Gia's known me for quite some time now, like a little over a year, right? And she was like, \"Oh yeah, Andy did this and that.\" And Jen was like, \"Who are you talking about?\" And Gia was like, \"How does she not know who the **** I'm talking about?\" She's like, \"Oh my god, why am I calling him Matt?\" Yeah.

Last night I went uh home to grab dinner with my wife and then I did an open mic comedy night at Iron and Gold. Um I was there watching. You just didn't see me. Oh, you were there? Yeah.
