The script is written by 23-year-old Shay Hatten, currently working as the assistant writer for Robert Downey Jr.'s Team Downey production company. IGN can confirm Lionsgate's option on the script. So okay, however, while possible it may be connected to John Wick, it's not yet set in stone. Well now have you seen John Wick?

They put on VR goggles to watch and interact with those making a dangerous journey through the desert by using VR as a method of reframing the immigrant experience.

The first one you see is Lucifer and she looks a lot like David Bowie and I was like this is cool, it's like that 80s Bowie style, like Ziggy Stardust, where she's got that coloring.
