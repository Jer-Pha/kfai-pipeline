Right now, you're surrounded by people just as passionate as you are \u2013 people who will inspire us to dream, people who push us to create, people who are Kinda Funny. Nothing can stop us.

But I feel like there's still a chunk of you who have no clue who I am, and you know that's totally okay. First off, those of you who don't watch wrestling, you should 'cause it's awesome. Yeah, and second, I am WWE Superstar Xavier Woods. You might in the front row, you might want to get ready.

We go to Tokyo, Japan; Melbourne, Australia; London, England; everywhere in the states, and we professionally wrestle. So we three travel around, we wrestle in a ring, and people watch it, and we happen to be the best three-man wrestling team in the history of televised wrestling. I think that should cover all the bases. Welcome to Kinda Funny Live 3. Now we're all here for a reason: whether you like video games, whether you like anime, whether you like comic books, or whether you like to get real weird and cosplay \u2013 that's something that all of us share; we have that in common, and that's essentially our ticket into this nerd kingdom that we've created, and we all love it with our hearts.
