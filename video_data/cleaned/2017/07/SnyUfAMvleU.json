He asked us for suggestions as the photographer, so I asked him that the Marine was going to be attacked by an infinite amount of demons it would be cool if he was on a hill and firing down at them... uh the model was holding the gun in various positions and none of them were interesting to me he did this for about 10 minutes this poor man he's like topless in a shirt full of programmers doing this um he did it for about 10",

Um, he did it for about 10 minutes and we just didn't see anything that we thought looked cool on the cover. I kept telling the model what to do but he couldn't see the scene in his mind. Frustrated, I threw off my shirt and told him to give me the gun and get on the floor. He grabbed my arm as one of the demons defeated. He deferred. I aimed the gun in a slightly different direction and told Don, \"This is what I'm talking about.\" Don took several pictures. I moved the gun some, and the demon grabbed my leg, other arm, etc. At the end, we all decided the arm-grabbing pose was going to be the best, and that's the story of how the cover composition was created. I am the Doom guy; that is incredible. Like, my favorite part of that story is like he also took his shirt off. Like, was the Doom guy not topless? No, he's in armor.
