Number two on the rer report I filed this one under no duh but I think it's interesting to discuss uh I titled it when are Metroid Prime 4 and Pok\u00e9mon Switch coming because GameSpot put up an article; it's basically like whoa Metroid Prime 4 might not be coming in 2018, to which I was like did we ever really think that was going to happen?

Additionally, the console's core Pok\u00e9mon RPG is listed as 2018 or later implying that it may slip out of the calendar year as well. This isn't entirely surprising however when the Pok\u00e9mon company president announced the title during Nintendo's E3 presentation it stated it may not release for a year or more.

The Reddit post was, \"Hey, my friend got banned after he killed this guy after saying he was a fan,\" and then he had links out to the videos of how it all happened. I'm not we're not getting into the weeds of that, but in general, stream sniping sucks; it does suck, but there I think it's weird if it being a bannable offense, yeah, yeah, it's like cheating, but I mean it's just it's out there, right?
