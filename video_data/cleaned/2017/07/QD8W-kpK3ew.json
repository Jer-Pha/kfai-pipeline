I, I heard a great saying and I think it's honestly true: \"Whereas abs are made in the kitchen.\" Yes, that is the best saying I've ever heard because what you put into your body really dictates probably about 80% of how healthy you're going to be overall. The other 20% is how much sleep you're getting, how much exercise you're getting, uh, what you're doing for your body work, how much water you're drinking, how much water hydration levels generally things like that.

Um, it's quicker to burn them, so I guess it spikes your insulin levels, your insulin stores fat quicker. Right? Guess that's my method. I totally just said five different things; look it up. No, you did. Um, with protein and with fiber, your body burns those over a longer period of time, and so instead of storing it as fat, it keeps it and says we're going to break this down; it has to work a little harder to break it down, and won't spike insulin levels.
