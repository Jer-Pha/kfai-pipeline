The one Tim Gettys let host how are you sir? I am fantastic, fantastic. You say watched the Castlevania series on Netflix this weekend, enjoyed it quite a bit, okay. Inspired me to play Castlevania III for the first time in many a moon, oh many moons, okay. Oh, I never beat it; don't think I've ever beaten any of the Castlevania games even since the night no, okay. Yeah, no, no, got really far but but Castlevania III a lot of fun, lot of fun playing that game, okay. Good well that's a good one how was the series? How was it? Was great, it was great. It's it ended prematurely; it was only four episodes as soon as it was really getting good is when it just stopped and I'm like such a cliffhanger hour-long episodes what I'm looking for 20-minute episod you can't get enough of it, yeah. It's cool, really faithful to the series um as far as I know at",

Kinda Funny Games Daily, I got in, put the little bar down, and I went on a roller coaster ride of emotions when it comes to Middle-earth: Shadow of War microtransactions. Microtransactions are a dirty four-letter word in video games, so immediately I'm thinking it's going to be bad, and then I read through, and I'm like, \"Oh, XP for this guy getting geared that way.\" Okay, it's a single-player game; what do I care? What you're doing, what you're doing... what do I care if you're getting through the game in 30 hours, and I'm playing for 60?

But I remember back in the Yu-Gi-Oh days when I'd buy just packs of cards, and I didn't get the Regis that I wanted, but I could go to the card store and buy it for $30 for just that one card. But you are paying a premium on it instead of the risk of the $4 booster packs or whatever the **** is.

I mean I tweeted one of my most popular tweets - we saved the Crash Bandicoot now it's time to unleash the dragon. So I'm hoping that the dragon does get unleashed at some point.

He's trying to combine all the names uh with the announcement of Horizon Zero Dawn DLC dropping on November 7th for $20. The question on my mind is how do I manage expectation? What do you think we can expect in terms of scope? Is this adventure 5 hours or closer to 15? Is the map size 1/4 the original or more or less? Thank you for your thoughts. Smaller map, for sure. Definitely, I think it's going to be closer to 5 hours. I mean, it's...

There are so many little things that are going to go wrong and so when you're dealing with Sonic Mania a small team that's already got their game on every platform pretty much, you can't mess around with that and then Mega Man again we're back down to just dollars and cents Capcom looks at the install base.",
