Yeah, should we come over now, we're hammered, or should you want us to wait until you're done?\" So she paid me that nice courtesy. I'm like, \"Well, it's your house; you can do whatever you want.\" She's like, \"No, no, but you guys are shooting. I don't want a rager,\" and so I was like, \"If you guys don't mind, like waiting till 6:30ish that would be great.\" Um, and then they came over, and I'm glad that happened because they brought the party.

And I actually stuck around this episode to watch the creators talk about what they were hoping to achieve with that scene, and I'm like you guys **** nailed it right. Like Arya telling her, \"Hey, you know you don't know where I've been, I don't know where you've been.\" That Sans-Arya moment where they're like they should be able to talk to each other but they've both been through so much **** but they're just like well... I liked that there was that one moment where she was like \"Uh, oh yeah, I have my **** kill list\" and that's what kind of broke them to smile.

And then you see her later in the next the tree not the tree, you see that you see the scene later where she's fighting um she's training the Bran and schooling her and then Sansa has that look on her face like like oh. Also later when uh the they're at the tree with Bran right and Bran brings up the the list the list yeah like oh this is a realing real this is real, yeah. First off Bran though I get it but you dude dude he's just not Bran anymore man which I guess Bran was one of my least favorite characters so the fact that he's gone I'm okay with yeah I don't really care but I think it's cool that like he's I think it's cool because I think that like because if he weren't that character I think they would have\"",

Like in Tyrion's mind, there's still a little bit of hope that once Cersei is gone, he and Jaime can maybe reform the family or something. He's still conflicted about it, I think. It's not even conflicted - he's still on Jaime's side because Jamie rescued him. The last time he saw Jaime was when Jamie let him out, making sure he got away. So I wonder what they're going to do with Jaime though, because now that he's falling in the water, it's like he's definitely not dead no. So does he get away?

And Tyrion wasn't like talking trash even though he knows the shit's real, but he wasn't like talking trash to NYS because then afterwards he went to talk to Jon separately and talk to Sansa separately. Unlike Sansa who's just like \"oh you're an idiot, Jon Snow\" in front of his people. It sounds like go get 'em. I also hate seeing Daenerys on top of the mountain watching her guys get killed like what, like what's his face - the actor? God, he's so good.

Basically, I think Jaime either dies or is just a Bas prisoner of Daenerys if he gets captured. Jamie has been a prisoner so many goddamn times when he was a badass, but there's no way there's no way T would be like, \"I'm going to let you go back to your sister.\" Like that's a huge blow to his army. For Tyrion, I mean, if yeah, if he were to do that, Jamie needs to kill Cersei. Yeah, like that's it; has to happen. I want Arya to kill Cersei; she won't. I mean, like there's the whole prophecy thing. I mean, the show told us already with the flashback from Cersei that her little brother's going to kill her, right?

Netflix is the first company acquisition in its history has bought Millarworld, the comic book publishing firm founded by Mark Millar, creator of characters and stories including Kick-Ass, Kingsman, and Old Man Logan. Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed. Netflix said it will develop films, TV shows, and kids' series based on Millarworld's portfolio of character franchises to life through films, series, and kid shows.

I'm so in love with what Netflix is doing and excited by their plans, Mar said. Netflix is the future and Marvel's world couldn't have a better home. I'm telling you right now, I'm excited for a number of reasons: one, this is awesome; two, Chrononauts is in this lineup, yeah, and I've said before, Chrononauts is an awesome concept for a comic book that would work so well as a series.

Stand by Chrononauts, I know that, I think I only had a four-issue run, but I think it's an awesome concept, but still. And it's funny because when you're reading this, when he's comparing himself to Warner Bros in DC, it's like, \"All right, you're not one of us.\" Right, dude. And then being like, he's like a modern-day Stan Lee that makes me kind of roll my eyes, but then I think about it, and I'm like, actually though, he's made a ton of new properties that are amazing - it's kind of hit after hit after hit after hit.

I mean we've heard recently that Netflix is in a lot of debt, we heard that they were 20 billion dollars in debt or something like that. But I mean you have to understand though, like for companies like this, companies are in debt until they're profitable right? Amazon famously was in debt up until what, like three years ago, two years ago, two years ago. So like that's you, you look at that and you say okay. But these people, they're not on one year plan, they're not on like a one month plan like we are right.
