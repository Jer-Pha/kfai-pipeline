I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the busiest lady in the business, Andrea Renee. Every day, every day when I do it, you make eye contact, I feel like I'm like I'm I'm annoying you, you're not, you're not.

But this is a good example all the same right, of like okay cool, that's a turn off for some people. But if there were built-in base not achievements but I guess badges of the fact that like you've played this for this many hours and you can pin that to a profile or show it somewhere have it shown off that way. I understand where that would be like okay, that's its own reward in its own way. And I think it speaks to what I was talking about earlier - granted this was you and me being like we don't use Xbox as much this generation but like where I feel like achievements have been pushed off to the side and hidden behind stuff whereas before they were way more in-your-face, and this is what it is.

It's another small change to the Xbox ecosystem that is cool no matter how many times they pull a neat trick like this though the question still remains, where are the first-party games? If you were a betting man, have fun in Vegas, how many games do you think Xbox are holding out on announcing? They set themselves up to have a very strong launch with the next Xbox, but do you think this will make any difference if they don't have a strong lineup? I love the show and can't wait for PS.

My concern or, and even, and I don't know if it's a concern either, one of my hypotheses is what's happening over there with these where are the Tri-A Exclusives? Right, is the fact that I think as much as it sucks, Xbox realized they lost this generation, and so when you talk about Halo, the next Halo, you talk about the next Gears, you talk about the next big AAA franchise from them. I wouldn't be surprised if they were those are in production for sure, and they were waiting for the launch of the Xbox 2 or whatever the next real Xbox is. Cuz no, I'm not even trying to take a pop shot at Xbox One X it's the PlayStation 4 Pro again which is fine and cool and it's going to get people in but I feel like that's not going to people aren't going to look at the Xbox One X and go holy **** now is the time to buy I've been waiting",

We we hope um and so they still have time to get in on this generation for Xbox; they don't necessarily need to look that far in advance. I don't think we're within two or three years of a new Xbox, see my argument on why they would be is I think that especially with the way they revealed or first mentioned Xbox One X when it's still Scorpio at E3 last year right so E3 2016 when they mention it and they have the video and it's everybody like holy **** blah and we all were like oh **** this seems like a real thing.

They put in WNBA and then they have this I'm going to read from GameSpot: Electronic Arts is once again attempting to revive the NBA Live series this year.

An edge in price can only help boost sales as EA found out over a decade ago when competitors like NBA 2K5 and NFL 2K5 were released for only $20. Uh, on top of this, NBA Live 18 Launches on September 15th, four days before NBA 2K18.

Thank you so much for watching. Remember each and every weekday except tomorrow, we're taking Big Kev to Vegas for a bachelor party - Vegas! We jump into the nerdy video game news you need to know about. Get dirty with it, go into your questions, and have a great time. We hope you enjoy it. Remember, you can watch live on twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames like so many of you do right now. I'll read Tubs, uh, Subs, and tips after this. I remember if you're watching later on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames, the full play of Batman episode one is up there. And if you're just listening on the podcast, thank you so much - drive safe, enjoy your time here at the supermarket. Might I recommend pickles? That's what",
