I hate having to do that when Kevin's not here, so I'm glad Cool Greg's there. First story, I got a Destiny 2 dump for Andrea Rene. I saw this two nuggets at Destiny 2 information. Here you go: first off, PC streaming going to be weird if you want to stream the game to the old Twitch platform or some Mixer. You can use Mixer for PC games as well, right?

But even if you're watching it on a wired internet connection, you're still probably not watching it in its full resolution anyway because you're streaming it. Sure, I think the important part is that you can play this game when you're by yourself, full screen, and get the graphical fidelity that's more important for the development team to focus on than how it's going to stream.

Bungie said Bungie has been open in admitting that they did not release expansion content for Destiny 1 fast enough to meet demand for the sequel. Activision brought in studios like Vicarious Visions and High Moon Studios to work alongside Bungie, in Hur's words, he said Activision is widening its stable of developers to keep up with the demand for more content I have a little bit of an issue with this why you don't like these you don't like these other people coming in and muddling up the waters no I'm happy for other studios especially since those two studios have made great games so I'm happy for them to come in and work on content my problem is that Destiny",

My problem is that Destiny vanilla was severely lacking in content, and the fact that they're breaking out DLC and intentionally making these expansions really robust and not putting that content into the base game is my problem. Okay, I spent a lot of money on all of the Destiny expansions buying multiple Destiny discs getting the collector's edition. I probably spent at least $300 on Destiny nice over a couple of years. Yeah, that's a lot for a game especially when you compare it to a game like GTA 5 was like Hey for 60 bucks you get it all yeah you know and so I'm frustrated that Activision is saying this headline on Gamespot says Destiny 2 DLC could be as important as the main game why is that a thing?

But I feel compelled to say that I'm kind of irritated by the fact that Activision is withholding DLC content because the base game in Destiny was not good enough. Sure it got excellent but it wasn't good enough and from what I've seen from Destiny 2 it really feels like 1.5 and the fact that they're holding content for expansions makes me go, \"but are they holding it or working on it?\" That's the thing. I still think Vicarious and High Moon should be working on this game at this point. Sure, but when did they bring in you? Think about it.

You talk to somebody from Bungie, you see how that hits with the schedule and keep going that way.

It's people that come in intending to buy bulk amounts and then sell them for a premium price on a third-party site, that's the really unfortunate part here. And then we've seen some retailers taking specific um tactics to try to ward this off, for example ThinkGeek recently with these new NES Classic bundles that we saw, they limited it to one per person, they're like you can only buy one, so if you're a reseller, you would have to make so many different accounts that they were hoping that it was discouraging to people. So unless retailers start taking steps to help offset the shortage problem to prevent resellers from gobbling up the market and then charging a premium price for it, you know we are really kind of stuck here.
