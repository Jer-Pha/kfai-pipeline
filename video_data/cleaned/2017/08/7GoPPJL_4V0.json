Not alone on the same thing - work together find a vehicle and fight opposing teams and the shrinking map to survive and win. To catch that base to get that stake. We knew it was coming. We knew something's gonna do a book man. I never ever thought about Grand Theft Auto what a perfect fit for it totally. Especially because over the past like two years they have - they've added in like loads of game modes that you wouldn't consider like traditional GTA online modes.

We'll see, that's the thing for me right now in a player versus battleground I've played it and I enjoy it. I'm like when comes next box I'll be all over right just cuz I'm better with a controller, I feel. I don't know how to use PC gaming stuff, I'm stupid, I'm an idiot, everybody hates a lot of buttons, I'm sorry though. Like that was the thing of like even we were playing it and we the party modes that are up right now for PUBG and when we just play around the office and we don't record it, it is that thing of I'm good at you know camping and hiding and getting down to the final ten but then it is the thing where I just I don't have you know the acumen I don't know where to shoot from out and right you know I don't",

Like, if I want to shoot things, I'll go shoot things; upon racing, I'll race. If I wanna hang out, but but if I wanna play a round of golf, they'll do that in GTA. I'm like, \"Yeah,\" and this is just like another way of obviously keeping that crowd very entertained. Yeah, but this does have the other element of okay, there's a lot of people to work on The Last of Us 5... no, wait, it's Grand Theft Auto V. Yeah, GTA V is free right now; it's right there, just sitting there. It's updating or it's not if you've got installed, but you can go play with everyone if you've already have it.

Yeah, so I would be interested to see what it's like. I don't think it's gonna be the same slow-paced affair; it's gonna be more like...I mean, even the key art they use looks more like Mad Max than it does PUBG because it's cars racing at each other and all the stuff hanging up that you're in in a team site. It sounds super fun. I'd love to see a let's play of it, but a party mode of it get in there and see...as a big PUBG fan, are you offended? Not at all.

It had some shining moments and is unlike anything in any other gaming ecosystem. Steam does have the game hub, and that's somewhat similar to me versus, in that it's a centralized place for people to talk about that specific game. However, because there is nothing that shows up in the game, it's completely optional, and most gamers probably never look at it. While I'm sure many people would see this as a negative, Miiverse posts being shown in-game for many of its first-party games made the community feel more active than it would otherwise.

No Man's Sky was the biggest ticket for Sony last year for a long time, right? That was made by like a tiny team, and we saw our expectation management basically for them, right? So that's a massive part of it, but like if you take a game like, like for instance, Uncharted is a very lesser version of the problem that Fallout 4 had, for instance. Were Fallout 4 by any means like, way overhyped? It's a quality game, oh yeah, it's a good game, it's technically impressive, it has shooting, it is you know quests are well-written and all this sort of stuff. But we don't look at games in bubbles like that.
