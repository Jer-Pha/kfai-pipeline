I spent the first half of my career creating and so all last month I had the time of my life laughing and writing Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, a flick in which the Jersey Boys have to go back to Hollywood to stop a brand new reboot of the old Blunt Man and Chronic movie they hated so much. It's a tongue-and-cheek silly ass satire that pokes fun at the movie business's recent redo obsession featuring an all-star cast of cameos and familiar faces, and I already met with the good folks at Miramax and they're into it, so I'm hoping we'll be shooting in the summer. Never give up, kids \u2013 you can do anything you want in life so long as you're patient and malleable. #KevinSmith lot yeah I was, and now Kevin, you and I are big Kevin Smith fans absolutely.

Next bullet point: it also benefits some retailers more than others, particularly online ones and those with strong distribution channels for big games. There's a potential challenge when it comes to bandwidth if those who pre-ordered Call of Duty all go online straight away at 12:01, that would put a lot of pressure on servers. Piracy would also be an issue because it makes the code available ahead of launch; the end of midnight launch may be happening anyway but not for all games if consumers can get their games without standing in the cold.",

We got that crew, get that ass. You already saw me circumcise Zygar last time. Who am I going to circumcise today? Goddamn take by the dick HS rabbit says Tim what's a good Fire Emblem game to start with. I would recommend Awakening simply because it is the easiest to get uh it's on the 3DS. I feel like it's a great entry to the franchise because it has characters that look familiar to you if you've played the Smash Bros and all that stuff uh and more importantly I think that it the save system and the the progression in the game is the easiest to wrap your head around there's a lot more random random battles that you can do to like level up and",

I mean, he's doing his own thing, and I haven't seen this obviously; I mean, I've seen him in The Lego Movie and a little bit in Lego Dimensions, but he's doing his own thing. So it's hard for me to give him a real quality. I mean, Kevin Conroy is the best. Can we just say that? Kev, can we put that out: Kevin Conroy is the best voice of Batman. Wait, who did the voice of Batman in The Dark Knight Returns? I don't know. Oh, I don't know; that went off top of my head. I didn't like it. Yeah, I didn't like either. That's the only reason I... that's the problem is like even in The Killing Joke, it wasn't Conroy or was it Conoy? I think it was Conoy. That Batman was just weird; that's the problem I",
