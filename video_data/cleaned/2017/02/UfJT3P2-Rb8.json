You're talking about World - Super Mario World, Super Mario 3D World okay the Wii one yeah just catching up sorry. Super Mario World is a 10, just making sure it's not an opinion uh my controversial opinions. It's weird because as I've done more and more things with you guys, it's you, you kind of warp my sense of uh what everyone thinks because I feel like there's the internet, there's my friends, and then there's like when I have conversations with both of you so I feel like my answers might not uh be correct for the widespread thing but Metal Gear Solid 4 and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess - taking aside the first 5 hours which admittedly are garbage and the tutorial sucks.

But uh Metal Gear Solid 4 gets a lot of hate and like on the internet this is one of those things where like people are oh **** that, like three and the rest of them are so much better it's like I don't know man I think they're all so good in their own ways but four as an experience technically it was HD just to saving the comments from P3 game just throwing it out there.

You can get away with that anyways. I have many uh I do believe in my heart of hearts that games overall pound-for-pound were better 20 years ago than they are now. Um, and I'm not saying that there aren't games that are better today than there were then. What I'm saying is that if you take the volume of games that were available on say uh in say 1994 across NES Genesis and SNES - the volume of games that were available there then - you take the volume of games that are available now on PC Xbox 360 Xbox One PS3 PS4 pound for pound per capita, there are more better games than there are now.

It's the beauty of it is that there is no objective truth about any of these things, um, but uh and a lot of people think I have rose-colored glasses about the past, nostalgic glasses, but no, it's it's we're not talking about when we're talking about like the early 90s, we're not talking about 1979, you know what I mean, like we're games like you go back and play a 2600 game, those games are bad, there's a few of them that are good but like go back and play Adventure or something like that and tell me that that game's fun, it's not, but when you go back and play Super Mario World, when you go back and play ActRaiser, when you go back and play",

Those games are awesome. Uh, Link to the Past; for some people, you know, Final Fantasy VI or Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy VI: Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger - these are all amazing games. Um, and it's a great time for us to have been alive and cognizant of those games because I was so stoked during that time. You know, those that even though I started playing video games in like 1986 or 1987, really you know I was so into it by the early 90s. So, so those are my opinions.

Do most video game releases fail, that would be like classifying all the games that didn't suck to you as in failures. This depends on the game. I think that the Final Fantasy XIII apologists, for instance, that are out there, it's like guys, it's not okay that you have to play it for 30 or 40 hours up after 40 hours though, that's not acceptable. But a game like um, there are games that if I had abandoned them a half an hour and I would have been disappointed. Uh, but I also think Wolfenstein is a great example; Resident Evil is another great example, the new one, VII, I think that there is this weird it's not a popular thing, it's popular in YouTube comments, but I think they're the only people that really feel this way that like you have to beat everything you",

And then I think this actually speaks to a topic that we did on the Game Over Greggy show, I do believe recently or it was just a conversation with Nick - I talk to Nick too much - but talking about the difference between Amazon Instant and Netflix for me. Where Amazon Instant, I go in, I look at the new movies, I go through and I'll take a chance on a cast I like, I'll give them my money and then I'll watch that movie. Whereas on Netflix when it's free, I'll jump into it and if I don't like it in five seconds, I bounce.\"",

You can trade it in, but you can't necessarily return it. B in the store, or it's digital, and you just own it \u2013 it's that thing.
