You need the trailers; you need us to walk you through and explain what the systems are and how this is going to shake out. That's very true, yeah. Um, Mr. Hines says, \"How's that new Wolfenstein coming?\" Uh, I Colossus... what is it? Colossus - remember this one? You showed it in your little trailer. I did, yeah. It booted up and it went through all the games, and that was there, really. It said New Colossus. Weird. Um, MachineGames has been hard at work on something... which I can tell you I have played is absolutely bananas... and I can't wait to show what it actually is and what they're actually up to, and then I'll let you know when okay, okay.

Um, that the way we're organized, the way my team is organized, that you know um I I stand here and talk to Greg much like Todd does about the game, and it's sort of like it ain't me doing it. I I did not do the Fallout 4 campaign. I I will go on record as saying I didn't do almost the vast majority of Fallout 4. I um you know that was Paris and Carlos and an and Matt Grandstaff and Tracy and Aaron and Steve Perkins and all these people that I have on my team who spend all this time working on these things and making up cool fun ideas, the special videos that we did like that was all like Paris's thing, she she sort of pushed that and put together this great thing and it was so cool.",

So we don't really half measure it or say like well we'll try 70% because this game's sales are X. Everything that we do is like we got to make it feel like a Bethesda game, which means quality and fun and doing some things that are interesting and unique and really bringing the essence of what the devs are making to the fans beforehand so they really get a sense of what the game is about.",

The way a Prey trailer makes you feel is part of the experience of playing Prey because it's creating a tone and a vibe and for what your expectations are which is why I was talking before about we really don't ever do things that are",

You put TLC into it, use that from here a lot. There you go, yeah. Um, Space G says, \"Hey Pete as a young professional in entertainment PR myself film, what advice would you give to people trying to make the transition into gaming PR/Marketing?\" What are the most essential characteristics, tools or skills? Prey looks amazing. Uh, thank you. Um, I I I get this question a lot.

I've only been at Bethesda. But in general, I think that what we tend to look for are people who are well-rounded - they're they've been involved in a lot of different things. Uh, you know if you do PR, you didn't just do PR, you worked in a lot of different areas whether you volunteered for stuff or uh, you know took on uh, student assistant positions while you were talking about how much you did in college. Right when I was at Wake, I was a I was a DJ at the radio station and I uh, was the manager of the of the Macintosh Labs back when none of us had our own computers and we all went to to labs to use them.

I was an announcer for men's soccer games. I did women uh women's basketball color commentary. Like I did all this different stuff, that kind of gave me insight into different areas like public speaking and writing and working with people. Whatever it is. And I think the more you can do to make yourself more well-rounded, it's invaluable because you know if in a company like mine those lines are blurred - just because you're working in PR doesn't mean you don't need to know about Community or influencers or branding.
