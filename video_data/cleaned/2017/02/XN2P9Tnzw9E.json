And when it comes to that, my favorite stand-up special I've seen is Bo Burnham - love that guy. I've loved him back since he was just making stupid YouTube videos in his room, and just seeing the progression of him getting an MTV show, getting the Comedy Central special, getting the Netflix special he just got, and there was a CD in between.
