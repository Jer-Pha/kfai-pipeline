And then I was also kind of drawn to it by the enemies - these creatures that can mimic various different things which we'll see them in a little bit, you've seen them in the trailers already um and in this where they actually... weren't getting to a point by the way where um or we weren't we didn't get to a point in the game where we got those Powers sure um but you know in the trailer you see like you get you get some of those Powers eventually right now this is just kind of the core game components where they're setting up the world right I mean this is this is the beginning of the game establishing his and what his role is now it's interesting, I love the way they\"",

I apologize right about now, I just like to see like you turn on the radio there's a good 10-minute section that I cut out of this where I just flush toilets well that's I mean that's what I love about video games and what about like you know especially ones like this where it's like all right go do this but no I want to go see everything else in the world, there has to be something else in here that I'm fear missing out on right maybe there's that one thing at the very beginning that I can never go back and get I got",

Yeah, it's probably locked because of me, because they know I'm going to jump off like test the boundaries of the universe and just jump off this damn thing. Cool space suit that I've got to put on. Oh **** end of the grid dog. I hope that music happens every time you complete a... it really does. Does it really? Yeah, it's this - the the the music in this game is awesome. So then what's the synopsis from what you've played of what Prey is? Um, Prey is first person shooter first and foremost with pretty decent like RPG and Resource Management elements to it. Um, but it's I I like it. It's got a nice balance of both those things. It's very much it's you know it's very much up my alley. I don't want",

I don't want to I don't want to compare it to anything else analog-wise, but it's sort of like if like DS: X and like Bioshock had a baby, but like don't do that, Kevin. Know Kevin gets on had a baby, but like in space, you know what I mean? Like that kind of style. Um, it's it's got those resource managements where we'll see later where you you know you have to craft parts and you have to um you upgrade you know your abilities and things like that, but it's not too far out that it didn't get me okay, you know? Cuz you know like when we when I watched The Horizon let's play or like when we play when we did our own let's play, I was like this is a little too much for me.
