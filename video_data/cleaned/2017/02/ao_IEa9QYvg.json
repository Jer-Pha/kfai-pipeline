Dark Souls is so plodding and slow, and frankly, not very fun for me. Uh, I liked Bloodborne because it got a little quicker and a little more arcadey. This game is very arcadey. Um, and so I think you guys if you understand what you're expecting there and whatnot, I think you're going to like it. I'm really looking forward to dumping some more time into it tonight, tomorrow, this weekend, etc. So I wanted to give everyone a heads up on that. An opposite heads up is that but I also downloaded Double Dragon IV a few days ago. Uh, it's only $7. Arc System Works put it out. It's terrible; absolutely terrible.

Um, so there's a follow-up there. I still it still doesn't quite resonate or sync up at all with Jason's reporting though the issue yesterday was that they were incentivized to dissuade people from buying new gaming and new new new games and new hardware right according to Jason. The Circle of Life program at GameStop is split into four segments, uh, the segments I believe are something like pre-owned games, etc., and so on. They need to reach they need to hit three or four of those quotas which requires them not to or encourages them to push the fact to not right push new hardware and new software and in fact according to these sources that",

And in fact, according to these sources that Jason had talked to people who just straight up lie about the availability of these games in order to push the used product. For instance, he brought up Watch Dogs 2, I think, which is $54.99 used and $30 new, but they make more margin selling the game. Uh, wait did you flip those? No, I didn't. It's $54. It's more expensive to get used right because Watch Dogs is so much. Watch Dogs had a huge price cut, that might be why the used game price is typically lower at GameStop for a newer game. You're only getting $5 off the product even though they'll only pay you whatever, $30. So the margin there is much bigger - the rip-off for people who don't know. And I talk about this in Colin was right, the rip-off of a retailer typically is about $12 on a $6 game new within the first 90 to 120 days after it's released.\"",

The other $48 goes to the publisher to pay their bills, $8 of that goes to the person who or the company whose hardware is being sold, $5 or so goes to the manufacturers, etc., and so on, right? So that's how the breakdown goes. So since the margin is so small at a $60 game, $12 - they look at it as saying well if we have a $54.99 used game that we paid $25 for, the margin there is $30, it's thick okay. So basically just it boils down to margins and profits, yes, your margins you're just way better on you got it makes sense that is an interesting business, it's uh it it it makes me question their viability this this is a desperate company like I I understand that they're they're changing or whatever but you know I saw a story yesterday Electronic Arts reported that a full one-third of their",

Yeah, so you have to assume they were assuming that given the lineage of the game and how long it took to develop, they were just like, \"This is a risk, let's put this out, see how this one goes.\" I'd love to know how much money they lost on it - is it 10 years of development cycle?
