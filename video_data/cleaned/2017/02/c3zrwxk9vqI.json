So a decade for me; however, you have a decade of full-time this is your life as well, granted you had the freelance stuff before then, and you did a whole little things like that, but in terms of you moved to San Francisco, you worked at IGN, you did all this stuff.

We - I think the part we enjoy or seem to enjoy the most is when we do the shout outs, and you shout out games, you shout out sometimes people and things along those lines. I thought what we do is do a decade of shout outs, the PlayStation stuff because we're a PlayStation podcast. Whether it be stories, whether it be games, whether it be developers, whether it be people that have influenced our decade working on PlayStation. Yeah, I - I want to keep it. I'm just going to talk about people, the games that they're related to, I think are are tangential but important and then they'll be some great games in there.

A lot of them found their way into the industry, most of them didn't; I haven't heard from most of them in a long time. But it could have been any of us, any one of us that could have gotten that email that day being like, \"Can you...?\" Because the original email came from Stephen Ing, who used to work at IGN, who was like, \"Can we use your facts on IGN?\" The reason that happened is because GameFAQs and IGN had a cooperation in the late 90s, early 2000s; then it fell apart. I don't know what happened; it might have just expired, whatever it was. And so he's like, \"We'll just make our own,\" and I was like, \"Yeah, of course.\" And then they emailed back 10 minutes later and were like, \"Do you want to write\"",

So I started working with Chris Carle who's still one of my favorite people in the industry; he works at CBS now, but um, he was in charge of IGN Guides for a very long time. Um, he let me stay at his house when I was in California; I slept on his couch and all these kinds of things as I've said many times. And so I owe him a great gratitude.

This comes from Chris \"Charlie\" Ryan and Tom calling themselves Mile High City - one Chris with a K, one Chris with a C, just letting you know. Hi Colin and Greg, and Kevin if you're there; I don't think Kevin's still here. Longtime listener and big fan of your work. I've been waiting for the best opportunity to submit my song for singing a shout-out, and the time is now. I manage Mile High City, an upcoming indie rock band from the South East of England - don't say \"oi\" hard not to though - and we have recently released two singles to the world for free. Here is our debut single, \"Back Off Back of the Wall.\" We love it, and we hope you will too. Our debut album, \"Playing with Matches,\" will be released to the world on iTunes, Amazon, etc., on the 10th of February. In the meantime, you can download",
