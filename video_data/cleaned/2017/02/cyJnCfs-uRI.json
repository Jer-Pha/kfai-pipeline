What metal gear...like, what kind of world are we living in where that's happened? And that is where I think it all fell down, like, we're fine, and like...and the fact I keep going back to, you know, you asked earlier, do I call him Hideo? I do because, like, people call people \"Hideo Kojima\" or \"Kojima-san,\" and that's a sign of respect. And I understand that, but for me, it doesn't feel right.

And that and so that interview where he interviewed me, you know, I think if you watch that video overall it's five, 5 and a half, seven minutes something like that long, and we talked for 45 minutes until literally his people had to be like, \"Mr. Kojima, you have to stop,\" like, \"We have other people to interview.

You treated him the way that everyone thinks about Kojima, which I thought was really good and he appreciated too. I thought that well that's thing he's a normal guy and I that's and but the language barrier and then the respect factor I think always puts him in this place where people are like how do I talk to you what do I do with you?

What I find very interesting is the way he talks about that it's all about Connections and it's going to be about that when you play the final game too, yes, there's you know third-person there shooting or whatever he said, there's action elements to it but he was saying that you know two hours into it you're going to start to see that there's more to this than what you thought there was. Yeah and that is fascinating cuz what he talks about in search of new technology the best tech around I really wonder if this game's going to have some kind of weird meta thing to it where I don't know if it's you start it and you link your Twitter, your Facebook or and it's that drastic and then somehow it's playing with **** like that and making",
