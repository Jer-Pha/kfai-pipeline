Mankind Divided was a large investment for the Japanese publisher, taking nearly 5 years to make. Yeah, it took a long time. We did Greg Miller do a lot of panel talks about that. Look, I can attest to this though: if you have, I'm seeing some people in the comments are saying that they're they've always been interested in Deus Ex but they've never jumped in.

And when you've got a movie like Guardians of the Galaxy, right, where people can go one of two ways: Disney's really looking at that property saying this is huge for us, you can't mess this up, which could make an even better game.
