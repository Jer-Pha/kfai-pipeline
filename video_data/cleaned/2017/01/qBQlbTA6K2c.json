Um so but we you you remain a visual show like it's a YouTube show and it happens to be uh put out on podcast. The reason we're doing this is because you guys have been asking for it for so long. But in addition to that, you guys have been complaining about Game Over Greggy Show and Gamescast not being topical enough. And there's so many times on both shows, specifically Gamescast, where we're like, oh, as we said on Calling Greg Live, and the amount of people watching Calling Great Live is so small.

It's, you know, learning from everything you guys have talked to us about and that, you know, you brought up a thing there, the fact that we have so many different encampments of fans, whether it is Twitch, whether it is YouTube, whether it is Facebook, so on and so forth, Reddit, our own forums, all these different things.

And so that's why we decided, you know, we started talking to people and looking around and we needed a community manager. And so for, you know, 2017, we want to be better to you guys. We want to communicate with you. And we went and hired Joey Noelle to be our community manager from the community. One of the best friends. Joey, you feel free to come in here anytime.

You know, I was skipping around. Obviously, I didn't have two hours three hours to sit there and watch the entire thing yet.

You know what I mean? We don't. And I think that that's one of the cool things. That's one of my major takeaways from this experience generally is that, you know, I had a funny situation and I've actually had that multiple times with Erin where she's like, uh, it's like we're night owls, so we're up like in the middle of the night and she's like, \"Oh, I'm going to",

That was what I was very well known for at IGN was was big long form pieces. But I have a very uh acute passion for for fiction and and you know, I love Ray Bradbury and and and you know, like a lot of, you know, kind of more retro sci-fi stuff and I love a lot of dystopian things and I love, you know, my Tom Clancy techno thrillers and all that kind of stuff. And then, you know, some classics, your Dickens and all that. Stephen King, a big big Stephen King fan. I actually read like the first 10 Goosebumps books when I was a kid. Uh, I think I was actually a little too old for him. I was like, I was probably like 12 or 13. I'll be honest, I really I really liked the movie.

Um, and uh, he comes out after three months to find that nothing had happened, but everyone's gone. Um, and I couldn't figure out how to uh, like I was like, this is just a very short Ray Bradbury story because there's no it's like a Twilight Zone episode. There's no like beginning, middle, end. But then I stumbled upon this idea that I was like a full-fledged like what in my mind I see as a trilogy.

And then I'm like I look back and I'm like just you know there's not too there's not too much written compared to what's going to be written but the ideas and the characters and all these kinds of things and the focal point and the juxtapositions of the fiction and how I think it turns a lot of things on its head. I think I'm really proud of and one of the things I always wanted to do is write a book and I've had those opportunities in the past um to do that whether independently or with a publisher and I've just not been able to execute on those mostly because of time and so I'm going to write my book my way and um I hope to have",

And I think I've managed to succeed at that largely. Uh I think 2016, a lot of people have been talking about 2016 as being this really negative thing for them. And I look back and I'm like it wasn't really that bad for me at all. Actually, it was extremely positive in a lot of ways.

And I was like you have to be kidding me. And I couldn't take it. Like I was like I'm like they are miles away. My favorite band. And then I went online later and saw the set list.

The only other you know because to Tim's point like when I think about the things I used to do to see 311 because I've seen them now 23 times or whatever the you know Ramon and I got on an airplane when we were 18 years old with no money and like we literally had like $50 between us. We had like some rough days in New Orleans before before Katrina to see 311 and 311 Day which 311 Day 2004 for 311 fans is like a notorious super famous show and we were there and we we we did it and when I think about it I'm like we just didn't even",

And then two years later we did it we went to Memphis and we did it again. A little better planned a little bit more money to see 311 Day 2006 which was another great show.

Back then, I didn't give a **** **** I never had two pennies to rub together. I didn't care. It was like, you know, I remember seeing 311 at Starland Ballroom, which was basically just a parking lot and and uh in New Jersey and Papa Roach opened for them. Yes. And uh and I loved Papa Roach when I was younger. Papa Roach pieces. This is my life. Uh they uh that first I'm going to stand by that first album Infest is **** that's a **** rocking rap rock rock album. Just go check it out. Listen this song on Dead Cells track four.

So I remember someone threw something at the stage and uh like a water bottle. Yeah. And the band just stopped playing, gave the crowd the finger or whatever. And I remember those little things and that's to Tim Gettys' point like that's written up later on the forums and stuff that the 11 bulletin boards were up but like if you're not there like you don't get the vibe and stuff like that.

Yeah, there you go. FOMO. No, we're not going there. Going off of that a little bit, and this is a weird one, but for me, E3 press conferences are such an important, fun, monumental thing that I look forward to.

I remember me and Alfredo being in line and me being so upset and having so much FOMO that I couldn't watch the Nintendo press conference.

You're lucky that you get to sit home and watch all this.\" E3 is amazing now from sitting at home. E3 is like NFL now. It's amazing where it's like, \"Yeah, why would I go to a **** game? I can sit here and watch everything.\" Yeah. The experience, they made the experience too good. Yeah, it is the NFL problem where it's like go to all these Jets games when I was a kid.

So, it it was crazy, but I kind of prefer just watching on TV cuz not hearing the announcers and not not seeing the camera cuts and like all Same with me in fighting. Like I've been to a few a few UFC fights and they're fun and it's cool to see them and I actually was very fortunate to sit up on almost at the press box for one of them which was like right like ringside so you can actually hear the like the slap as people are getting kicked in the face.

Bizkit's one of those bands like Odyssey. For me, the other thing was like growing up so close to LA and not doing anything in LA was really kind of a that's one of the things I regret. Um, like I grew up gosh like an hour away from LA and then you know my wife is from LA, she worked in LA, she lived in LA for a very long time and so hearing her stories or like just just seeing how she grew up versus how I grew up and I'm like it's so weird to me that that you",
