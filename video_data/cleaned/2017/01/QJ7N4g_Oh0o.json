It's uh, you know, unno... sand um, unfortunately Carrie Fisher passed, so it begs the question: what do they do with Star Wars episode 8 and 9? And should they be considering doing something with her in CG like Tarkin, and exactly in Rogue Legacy - yes, Rogue Legacy, definitely. You know, Rogue one, I mean...

What was a little more off-putting to me was the Jeff Bridges stuff and like the flashback scene and all because then when you see what's supposed to be Jeff Bridges' character in real life, and he looks exactly the same as the computer villain version, that's when it was like a little bit weird to me. And I feel like they could have cut that stuff out. See, I just feel like you... I feel like we're just in the uncanny valley right? I feel like no matter what happens, we as human beings will never recognize that as real; it's just not going to happen in our lifetime at least or not in the next 20 years.

When that guy, remember the character on Star Wars, you can't do that on television. That used to shoot everyone; he was the Executioner, and then some guy would run on and say, \"Stop the execution.\" You guys don't... no, I for the record, you can't do that on television. No, you can't do that on television. I loved it as a kid, but all I can remember is the Slime and the lockers because I was so young. I could tell that you were older than me; I know. I watch... I mean, I watched syndication. Um, sorry to interrupt with Tarkin. I can understand; I mean, a lot of people thought he was real, and that was great. It was done very well.

That documentary just came out with her and her mother. I just don't know if people are going to be able to see that as real and if it's not going to uh hinder the process or hinder the actual final product.
