I don't know in what world it takes you 15 hours to be Resident Evil 7, but um it might take you longer. I might take you short there's a trophy for beating it in four hours. Yeah, um and uh I I think that it's it's it's atmospheric and ambient and well-made and I I really enjoy it. The one the one critique that I wish I remembered for the review that I didn't stand that I didn't state which is a big one for me and I don't know if you uh saw this, I don't know if anyone else cares is that the game being in first person yeah requires it to tell you your hurt in different ways unlike uh Isaac and Dead Space with the like his back like on his back or the typical uh Resident Evil Huds with like you know the the the health",

But I'm hesitant to jump in since the game is absolutely terrifying in VR. So I have to ask: with Resident Evil 7 being such a frightening experience, would it hinder itself from becoming a killer app for the PSVR or are we still waiting for the game/experience to Skyrocket at the PSVR? Thanks for all you doing the fun videos, Jeremiah. Um, I don't think Resident Evil 7 is the killer app for VR. I think it's a great use of VR. I think it's a...

I played on my girlfriend's PS4 naturally or normally and uh it was perfectly fine that way, I thought it was fun that way as well.

There are story-related trophies, but there are multiple endings, uh multiple difficulty levels, one of which you cannot unlock until you beat the game on normal um, and some certain things that you kind of have to do at certain times.

I was browsing the trophy collection of Colin Moriarty, and I saw a game that based on the time in which he platinumed it - 23 hours - is near and dear to his heart. That game is Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. I know some may look at this as a childish game, but the reviewer on IGN.com, one Mr. Greg Miller, stated that the variety of games is nice and the multiplayer is actually fun. And despite staring at a cave wall isn't very interesting, it's an very interesting storytelling device. It sounds like a Hidden Gem to me. Thank you for everything you do, and in case this is a turd, don't do it anymore.
