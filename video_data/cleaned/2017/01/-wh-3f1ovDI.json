Uh, so I'm going to go through the games. Um, so basically what happened is I went through my trophies and then I wrote down all the games that I thought could be on the list. Um, and I identified five games that didn't make the list for a specific reason, and then another seven games, I think yeah, that didn't make the list for a different reason. I'll just go over those really quickly before we get into the list. Uh, Hitman, the core Hitman game, I just started it's I'm going to spend more time with it after break. Um, it's important to note that this is an incomplete list because I'm going to spend the next two weeks playing games I didn't play so it could be that this list frankly isn't even valid by the time you hear it but I think this is probably going to be the essence of it but Hitman I just didn't spend enough",

Uh, last year I played less than I would have liked to because of personal problems and the business kind of taking off and all that kind of stuff. This year I played way more games than I intended to play or than I thought I would play - it's an excessive amount of games actually. Um, so this is the list now, and it's in alphabetical order, not in the order that I think I like them, not in the order that I think they should necessarily be. Uh, Battlefield 1, uh, the first game on the list, it's a special shooter, I think that its strength is in its storytelling and its vignette style. Um, I know that this was a redemption story for DICE in a way, and I know this is a redemption story for fans of the series after how bad Battlefield 4 was for a lot of",

It's not really really nonlinear, but you go to like a world, like a map, like a solar system map, just like you would in Mass Effect and you pick a planet or a place you want to go there's... the guys are over on Venus and they're at you can't land on Venus but they're over at Venus, there's a derelict ship there, they're trying to mine it, go and **** them up right, like you don't have to do that but you can and you do. And I liked the role-playing kind of mechanics of uh upgrading your character and upgrading gear and having kind of some options in that way.

Um, that I'm like, I don't have the patience for this. I just want to get through it, so I'm playing it on normal. Uh, there was a lot of skepticism with this game not only because of the fact that Bethesda, which published it - they own id Software - uh, not only because they didn't give review copies but also uh, I think skepticism because of Doom 4, what was once known as Doom 4's tortured development and uh, there was every reason to be skeptical and to think that this game was going to pan out, and it panned out, I think better than anyone could have possibly imagined. And one of the major things that I think is important to note about Doom in particular is that everyone's like, 'Well, it doesn't have a story,' and I'm like, 'I profoundly'\"",

I'm like, Gonna break my Vita in half when I'm playing it. But it speaks to the game's quality and the game's hook that I keep coming back to it. It's just really good. And uh, for people that don't know, it's just a very basic Japanese indie game - you're falling down a well, hence the name. You have gun boots, and the idea is that you're basically trying to build up combos by not landing. Um, and you can land on any platform if you want, but you reset your multiplier. But that's also how you reset your bullets. Uh, so you have to balance out this thing where like, if you bounce on an enemy it refills your bullets, but if",

That feeling I had a lot as a kid as a young role-playing game fan where most of what I played from age I would say well from the time I really got my PS1 until so Final Fantasy VII in '97 until 2001 or 2002, that's pretty much all I played was Japanese roleplaying games, and uh you always got that sinking feel when you beat a game that you like because you invested so much time in it.",

I bet this game sold significantly less than Limbo, and uh, I think that's a shame. I think it's a time and place thing, though. Really, with well, Limbo was the kind of headline title; you know, it's like you can download this, and then it took off, and not only that, it did brew and cook for a long time before it went everywhere.

And I think that's a great sign - first of all, not everything needs to be a movie. Second of all, $40 price point for a AAA Ratchet & Clank game from Insomniac is one of the best games of the year and uh I mean I don't think it's even close. Like I think that Ratchet is clearly special and uh you should play it. Number eight is Severed, uh best VR game of the year I think by a mile. DrinkBox Studios - what can you say about those guys? They've supported Vita since the very beginning. This was a Vita exclusive; it's on other things now but they made this game for Vita and they knew they were releasing into a void. Vita was dying, but there's a hardcore audience there that bought the game and has supported it. And what I like about it the most is that",

However, considering the context of the conversation and the hosts' preferences, it might be more accurate to assume that Colin Moriarty was referring to 'Persona 5'. If so, it should be capitalized.\n- \"saber\" likely refers to a gaming term or a specific mechanic in a game, but without further context, I left it as is.",

When I finished, I was like, \"This is a phenomenal, just epic game.\" And I'm like, yeah, it is, but there's a lot of problems with it too. Inside quickly went ahead of it and uh on my list end, um, I think that what you know we were talking about tone earlier with some of these games. I think that I think Uncharted 4 missed some of the tone of what made the old Uncharted 3 games good, and I also think that its focus on ancillary characters was a mistake. Um, because this is the last time we're going to see them, and so I missed they missed a lot of chances to give us a little bit more of what we wanted, and they're going to try to rectify that with the DLC with Chloe a little bit, but Naen's in it.

I platinumed it, I played it twice, I really enjoyed it. And I think it's just what's cool about it is the art style is a little obtuse and a little weird, but also there's not a word spoken in the game, there's no words on the screen, there's no words said; it's all through observation of scenes and facial expressions and all those kinds of things that you get what the game means, and even then there are a lot of ambiguity and there are a lot of theories about what the game really means and what's going on in the game.
