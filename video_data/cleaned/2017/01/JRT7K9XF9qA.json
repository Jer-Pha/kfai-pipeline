            "text": "Oh, this episode of The GameOverGreggy Show was brought to you by Blue Apron. I've talked about Blue Apron quite a bit, ladies and gentlemen, because you know #cooking with the Gregy. I cook all the time, and Blue Apron was a gift my mother gave me last year. I'm pretty sure she did not use the code; I'm not sure if we had the deal. But basically, Blue Apron sends you all the fresh ingredients you need to make awesome meals. And you might say, Greg, \"I have no talent at cooking like you do.\" And I will tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, I once had no talent at cooking either, before I became the male Rachael Ray. Basically, all you need to do is these are 30-minute meals for the most part; they send you the instructions, you go through step by step with the pre-portioned ingredients, and you make whatever you want. Do you want to know some of the upcoming meals? Hell yeah, you do! Seared pork chops with farro, pharaoh, and cranberry chutney. I don't even know what that is, but it sounds good.",

I don't even know what that is, but it sounds good. Spaghetti squash and marinara with mushrooms and garlic knots. Garlic nuts are great. Spicy shrimp and Korean rice cakes with cabbage and furikake. I can't be right how you pronounce that, but that's how I'm going to do it anyways. It's affordable; it's less than $10 per meal for per person. Uh, they deliver it all to you. It's seasonal; it's flexible. You get to go online pick your meals. Everything's great. So here's what you do: check out this week's menu and get your first three meals free with free shipping by going to blueapron.com/greggy. You will love how good it feels and tastes to create incredible home-cooked meals with Blue Apron. So don't wait; that's Blue Apron, a better way to cook. What's up everybody?

I got it from a local San Francisco brand, Marine Layer - they make them in uh, in the city as well; they're made over in the Mission. Okay, it's fun. I don't know if they still sell this, but I'm sure they still sell a sweatshirt like this - might be a different material though. But you want the terry cloth? I'll get you a terry cloth one, thank you; they're very warm. You look warm, cover up, but you look... yeah, that's why you're wearing them 'cause I've been a little sick and I was very cold last week, which added to the sickness, I think.

I think it represents um a pretty unique thing that I don't think we've seen in a very long time, which is an original uh musical. Um, B it's not something that's necessarily in vogue right now in the time of uh Star Wars movies and comic book movies. Um, but everyone seems pretty hyped about that, and there's a certain... and I think it's because there's just a certain magic to the trailer and a magic to the cast and a magic to Damien Chazelle who's the guy that did Whiplash. So I wanted to gauge like hear from you guys what your thoughts were on it and musicals in general right now, um keeping in mind of course that they're still doing all these uh live event musicals, they just did Hairspray.\n\nI corrected the following errors:\n\n* \"room room\" \u2192 \"La La Land\"\n* \"Daman chazelle\" \u2192 \"Damien Chazelle\"\n* No other changes were made to preserve the original meaning and grammar.",

I remember when I was at Northeast, I remember someone had a Canadian flag hanging in their dorm window or whatever, and people across from it were like, \"at this place called Stetson where this was a big dorm but then there was like a dining hall there\" and the people across the way would just play \"blame Canada\" out of their windows like constantly, like for months, like during the day, like just to insult this one person they probably didn't even know. It's great that's that's the beauty of South Park, and then there was Team America: World Police movie which I will never forget seeing the trailer for that in theaters because that was one of those moments because it's a different time last time they tried to do something different if that trailer comes out now it'd be like all right cool I'm used to it actually I guess the Sausage Party trailer did catch me off guard",
