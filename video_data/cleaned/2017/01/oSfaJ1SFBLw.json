Oh, so this one, okay, so this is very interesting. So we can time it a little bit and it looks like you actually actually that little prompt appeared. Looks like you can do it to enemies too, the little slash jump maneuver. I like this a lot. Greg saying it's cool, I agree. God, if you haven't played the original Shovel Knight, you really got to play it. I don't care where you play it, I know I played it first on Wii U and PC and I loved it. Um, but in case you're just watching this out of curiosity, I really do highly recommend the game. It is so fantastic especially if you love old school games like me. Uh, so let's see. Oh, how do we get... oh I think I ruined that one. Can I jump on the bubbles? Oh I see. Okay, yep, all right. So I wonder was there a secret with the the dragon probably. I love that.

No, I think it's a reworking of it. I think it's a new one, cuz it said it was Black Knight's map. I don't know, like the introductory map. I'm not really sure. It reminds me of the intro map, cuz here if there's a music note at the end, that's at least so. Here this will be interesting. Let's see if we can do it. Got kind of sacrifice yourself just a little bit. I'm liking it. Kev, I'll tell you what looks good, man. So we proceed on. I don't want to mess this up. There we go. Get that currency that we can use in town.

It ramps way more because that was actually one of my complaints about the original Shovel Knight - was just not hard enough. Cool, awesome. Oh wow, you can knock him off of it. It's awesome. I love that, and like that. Oh, it's so cool. Specter KN is a g tell you should we go and do try to do Polar Knight stage? Yeah, Kevin's giving the emphatic nod.
