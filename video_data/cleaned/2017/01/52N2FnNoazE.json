The fact for me is, if I was DC Comics or Marvel, to an extent - and this is also me saying this without really knowing their financials, knowing how much they're bringing in week by week - but in a perfect world, I'm in charge of DC Comics. Like you need to revolutionize this and make us money and do all this stuff again. I would say, \"All right, great. Stop everything. We are ending weekly comics. We are not going to do that.\" And I'm going to take the Netflix approach - not even the distribution model. We're going to do the thing where we took Max and we took Jim Lee and put them together.

And you know, that's what it is. And if Alan Moore wants to come in and write in that universe, he's more than welcome to that's fine. You can keep going there's but there's no continuity to worry about; there is no buy, there's no two issues a month you need to put out because those stories suck.

They booked him on a day rate, I'm sure. So that was like $50-$60,000 for him to sit there and go through like get the Kinda Funny get it to Giant Bomb get it, you know what I mean? Like or maybe I don't know. I mean if I had to do that I would've F'd there was a cut in there so I would have filmed all of it one take and then just that one little bit I would have been like 'do this here are the 10 things you're supposed to say' and then you cut them all together but yeah that was probably pretty.
