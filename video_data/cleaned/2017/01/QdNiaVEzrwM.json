    "description": "Welcome to Kinda Funny Year 3! Community is our focus in 2017, and we've heard that you want the Kinda Funny Morning Show (formerly Colin & Greg Live) on YouTube and as a podcast. So, that's what we're doing. \n\nThe Kinda Funny Morning Show will still be live on http://www.Twitch.com/kindafunnygames Monday through Friday, but from now on, the KFMS will also post here on YouTube, and eventually, it'll pop as a daily podcast. We're still troubleshooting the podcast process and expect to have it working in the coming weeks/months.\n\nCommunication is important to us, so understand that this is a whole new world for us. We're figuring it out as we go. There's a good chance that episodes of the KFMS will be muted, taken down, and so on. We're experimenting with this on the fly and learning as we go. \n\nSo, let's try something new together!\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunny\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nColin - http://www.twitter.com/NoTaxation\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller, Colin Moriarty, Tim Gettys, and Nick Scarpino talk about the biggest stories in nerd culture.",

We have a lot to talk about on this show. It will be pretty much uh, Switch-oriented, talking about it a little bit after following up with some of the news people, of course. Playing it ourselves, our own Tim Gettys and Colin Moriarty out in New York playing it right now. We'll follow up with some of their tweets, see what they think. But first things first, like I said. Anything Can Happen. Nick, I need you to come sit in. We need to come sit in, yeah. For two seconds. I just got to go to the bathroom. Sorry. We ran out of time today.

You find interesting little trademarks that you can right-click on things. I really hate the fact that if you scroll down, I can't see - there's no second monitor going for me, Nick, so I can't tell where you are if you're looking at the neon colors here. Hate that they're mixed and match Neons. Give me a blue Switch and a red Switch; don't give me the blue and red Switch because then this plays into their whole game of 'well, why don't you buy one half of it for $50?' We'll get to that in a second. Uh, keep on scrolling - this is insulting. The Pro Controller is $70, very upsetting. I like my whole thing.\"",

A lot of people were offended by I don't personally know the ins and outs of how that's working well based on the inflated cost of everything else, you can assume that that's not an appropriate cost for that. Sure, that and that's that's where it gets if everything else is appropriately priced and then this was 90 bucks or whatever it is, yeah, 90 bucks be like okay I guess there's proC processing power in it right, I mean that's taking it from 720 to 1080 or whatever I don't know what the hell's going on.

Zelda will sell very respectfully, but it's not going to do Mario Kart 8 numbers; it's not going to do Smash Brothers numbers. So as we saw with previous versions, well, Skyward Sword was really the last major one, and people remember that Skyward Sword on a console with 100 million install base came out around the same time as Uncharted 3 on a console with about half that install base, and Uncharted 3 healthily outsold Skyward Sword.

Nintendo said it to me when Mario Kart came out because I'm such a huge Mario Kart fan. And so looking at the Switch, I was like, \"I Wii U's launch library had nothing for me,\" and then no promise except for Breath of the Wild and Smash way down the line right? And so to look at the Switch now, I'm like, \"This is a bad launch lineup.\" I'm not happy with the prices on controllers, blah blah BL blah. But I do want to play Zelda, and a month later, I do want to play Mario Kart on the go when I... I do want Mario Kart on the plane that's awesome, and then in the fall, I'm definitely going to want that Mario game.

When it's not plugged in, players can expect between 2 and a half and 6 hours of gameplay at the highest brightness setting. Games like Breath of the Wild can run for about 3 hours on battery alone before needing a charge - that's what we were talking about last night. All that is Dev math: how long is that really okay? I'm getting about three hours of Breath of the Wild, so two and a half hours is about three hours, and is the brightness all the way dialed down? What the hell's going on?

It reads as follows: Carrie Fisher died less than a fortnight ago but in the minds of Disney movie moguls and Star Wars fans she's very much alive and with what might be regarded as unseemingly haste Disney is negotiating with the actress's estate over her continued appearance in the franchise.

Why do you think Nintendo's online platform seems to be so much further behind the competitors? It's been over 12 years since the launch of Xbox Live and about that for PlayStation Network. So what do you think is causing all the major delays? It takes time, man. I mean, that's the major thing. Is that the infrastructure you have to... I mean not that the infrastructure for instance of Xbox Live as it was released in 2002 is the same as it is in 2017. It's not that - was 15 years ago. But when you get the ball rolling and you have the expertise, and you have that infrastructure set up, it's easier to make moves. The fact that Microsoft was first is the reason why Xbox Live is considered the best ecosystem because of the best infrastructure because they had the most time to work on it, and then PSN is second because they had the second most time to work",

Nintendo ignored this problem for a really long time, and you have to remember that uh I think it was Zada not even a decade ago around the time that we launched said that people don't want to play online - well he was completely wrong, and Nintendo was completely wrong, and that was the \"I don't want to play online\" he was talking maybe talking about me but they were wrong, and they had that mentality. So when you need to build an infrastructure like that it takes a lot of time and and a lot of resources in there just ill prepared to do it - they probably do not have the expertise to do it; they cannot H you know it's hard, and um so I think that's the reason why I just didn't think that they were this far behind.
