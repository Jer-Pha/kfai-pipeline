Uh, my topic comes from Star Wars this time, it's uh, you know, no sand... um, unfortunately Carrie Fisher passed, so it begs the question, what do they do with Star Wars episode 8 and IX? Well, eight is done, nine should be considering doing something with her CGI like Tarkin in Rogue One. Yes, Rogue Legacy - definitely, you know, Rogue One I mean, spoilers...

Um, I didn't think it well, obviously the effect didn't work that well in Tron. I didn't see in I didn't see Tron so who was who in Tron: Legacy? They made Jeff Bridges younger, so his the villain was the younger version of him. It was it was a program but it looked like him. Um, and so when Jeff Bridges came in he had to fight himself which I was like that's cool but it didn't really work they couldn't I guess they didn't get the right team on it or there there was a lot of criticism it it was 2008 well it was but I guess they wanted the people that I the way I heard the story and I could be completely wrong was that the the Benjamin Button team that that did The Curious Case of Benjamin Button which was",

When that guy, remember the character on Star Wars, you can't do that. Intelligent, used to shoot everyone; it was like the Executioner, and then some guy would run on and say, \"Stop the execution.\" You guys don't... I for the record, you can't you can't do that on television. No, you can't do that on television. I loved it as a kid, but all I can remember is the slime in the lockers 'cause I was so young. I could tell that you were older than me; I know. I watch... I mean, watched it in syndication though. Um, sorry to interrupt with Tarkin.

I mean I I can't remember him in other movies after you know A New Hope for the most part so you look at that and you're like, I guess that's sort of okay but I mean Carrie Fisher everyone knows Carrie Fisher. I just saw her in a film, you know, that documentary just came out with her and her mother. I just don't know if people are going to be able to see that as real and if it's not going to uh hinder the process or hinder the actual final so to bring everybody up to speed episode 8 is done they said her scenes are done her scenes are shot, done and she's she from what the report I heard read was or heard on the Colin Moriarty live show was the fact that uh it's her stuff's",

What do you do? Obviously, that they're up against a conundrum - this is what I lovingly refer to as the Fast and Furious 6 conundrum, right or seven, excuse me, conundrum. Um, is that you don't know what to do? You can't not make the movie; you do that. I think there's a tasteful way to do it. You don't agree; you thought the end of Fast and Furious 7 wasn't... I think we're talking about apples and oranges here. I think if this was episode 8, and she was a main character there, and okay, we have to fill in a few holes like they did with Fast Seven right?
