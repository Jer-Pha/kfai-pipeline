So a couple months ago we did a topic on two topics actually - every game coming out before E3 and what we thought about it, if we thought was going to get delayed sure, and if you thought was going to like set the world on fire or whatever. There was a ton of games, but this was Horizon and then Enter the Gungeon. Now I want to do the same thing before E3 happens - all the games that we know are either hammering a release date in 2017 or that are said to be coming out in 2017, and kind of go from there. Also, it's the discussion of what games are we most excited for? My all-time iPad app is on you... I don't want people to know they need to know starting with the first big one for me - Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy. Super damn stoked June 30th, hell yeah! Get hyped!

I don't love it as much as you do; um, it's not a good game and just that the secret is I don't think it's a great game and so like that's why I think the remake is pretty but I was worried I'm like running at the camera you're on some **** yeah that's why I think they are fixing the problem the things I hate about Crash 1, yeah nothing; are they they're adding analog control? Yeah definitely.

Yeah, well, Splatoon and a shooter - you know I mean I get on a day yeah more Power Stone, no, and I love Power Stone so I'm like alright I'm gonna wait, the jury's still out, we'll see where that game lands but I don't know then Splatoon to July 21st again I'm happy that I'm gonna give it another chance because I had fun that one time we did a let's play yeah I'm at it's one of those really like the Wii U exactly I was so over with you at that point I never gave the game a chance, I'm gonna give it a chance here I'm yeah I think I'll be assuming Nintendo can get their online **** you know connectivity issues Mario Kart cannot answer we don't",

It's going to align with this: the online pay service was coming late around the year, but Splatoon One slowly became a relatively big hit, especially given how this whole thing is out there. So by almost five million copies, yeah, in exchange, Arabella liked it a lot; he just doesn't like Nintendo stuff. No Destiny never made its way to them, exactly, exactly. Um, yeah, I'm excited for this. I hope there's a sort of big lean into a single-player thing because I don't really have time, yeah. I mean, dude, that's my thing; I'm hoping for it.

It sort of reminds me of like the Mario & Donkey Kong: March of the Minis that I would like every year, and you're like, \"How?\" And it's there, like I think their whole thing is like Pikmin's too complicated for children, so we're going to get them in with this. And I'm like, stop it - stop it! Don't also what about Switch? I click it; I really don't want to open my 30s.
