It looks a whole lot like Destiny 1; it kind of does yeah and is that a good thing um I expected I don't know why I expected a jump in visuals because Destiny 1 was cross-platform on like PS3 and Xbox 360 so or it could just be that my eye has been trained to see newer games and I I just I don't see the huge jump in visual fidelity that I was expecting but uh I'm sure it's there it also could have been just been the shitty streamer watching new classes include the Warlocks Dawn blade complete with flaming sword",
