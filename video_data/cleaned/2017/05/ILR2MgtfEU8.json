I'm excited about our efforts together as well as the team assembled to shepherd these characters to life. The show will be executive produced by Shawn Levy, who worked on the Mummy franchise, and Jason Brown, who worked on The Expanse. The Oscar-nominated visual effects studio Platige Image is doing the show, but the official release doesn't specify if it's CG animated or live-action or a mix of the two.

Yeah, I know, I know both of them will probably be well-received, but I don't know if this one is going to... it depends on how they market it. Remember, this is Netflix, so like everything's new on Netflix. So to the Netflix audience that doesn't know The Witcher, it doesn't matter to them; doesn't matter right? Yeah, that's true. Now here's a... we just watched the trailer for Glow. For Christ's sake, that's awesome! That's **** awesome! I cannot wait for that.

It's worth noting that this only accounts for two days of sales, as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was released on April 28th. Wow, so that's nuts! Yeah, I mean yeah, wow - good for them. I mean, look, carts are a great game, yeah, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild continues to be a strong seller for Nintendo, as well as the open-world adventure was April's best-selling game. Do you think there are a group of executives in Japan right now, at Nintendo Japan, who are just swimming in large piles of cash?

Uh, King Arthur earned just $1.5 million. Let's skip down if you had told me a few years ago... actually let me read that. King Arthur just earned $1.5 million on its opening day, but we knew that was coming, and it just means that the multi-film Night at the Museum of the Round Table franchise isn't meant to be, but Power Rangers is the real tragedy earning just $1.5 million on the first day and arguably sealing its fate barring a post-theatrical miracle - it's one and done for the Power Rangers franchise.
