One is that like Will Smith got famous while I was in high school and I grew up in a small town in the South, okay? So everybody that I was in high school with I had known for like 10 years at that point nobody like nobody made that connection when The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was on TV and the guy's name was Will Smith and like I never heard a joke until I went to college and my freshman year in college I",

And like Gary's, like hey you want to come to my panel? Come to the lobby of the Omni and you can walk over with us and we'll take you in the Green Room. Will Smith wasn't there; it was his production team all that they were all there. So I met his brother-in-law who's one of The Producers on the film introduced myself, and the dude just started laughing and fell on the ground he was laughing literally rolled on the ground laughing when I... myself, little too much like I maybe I didn't need this for thanks for bringing me I'll talk to you later this is lovely but the panel was nice.

If you need to convey a bunch of information, you send them an email or they look at they look at a piece of paper or something like that. Reading isn't great in the goggles with the current resolution of the displays. So, we're having to build all these interesting UI elements that are like kind of mimic real-world objects.

The thing that that platform has problems with is the hand controllers, like the touch. I said the touch were great, like what five or six years ago when they came out, but the fact that you can't go in and out, that you lose that Z-access makes it really hard for people who want to port games from Vive and Oculus over to that platform. And then the other thing is that it's much more expensive to develop for a closed platform like the PlayStation than it is to just jam something up in Unity and jam it out on Steam.
