Did I like Grand Theft Auto 5 more than The Last of Us? I don't know. I think I liked... I mean, I probably would have said Grand Theft Auto V at the time, but looking back, The Last of Us was a much more memorable game and like, the transformative game. And so my thing is, back then and now, I still went with The Last of Us. Sure, so let me hit it off with my list: 2012 Journey, 2013 The Last of Us, 2014 Super Smash Bros for Wii U, 2015 Metal Gear Solid V, 2016 Overwatch. Okay, what you got? Um, I got Spelunky for Xbox 360 in 2012. Okay, like I still play Spelunky probably once a month; game's amazing. Um, I got Super Mario Brothers 3D World and The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, which I think were both 2013. Oh, you are man, speaking of my own heart, what you love them, those great games, love those games specifically 3D World; it's on way too much, man.

Um, it's it's it's open it's a it's a critical path game where you can go down this path the way you traverse that path is going to be different for everybody because if you want to play it like a stealth game you can play like a stealth game. If you you want to hack a bunch of **** and just murder everybody, you can do that. If you just want to go through guns blazing and kill people, you can do that too. And instead of kind of leading you by the nose like a traditional kind of RPG or um uh I'm trying to think Prey well Prey is the next game by the by those guys at Arkane um it's it's you see you you begin to look at the world you know that moment in The Matrix when Neo looks down the hallway and it bulges and he sees the code underneath yeah you get that moment about two levels into Dishonored right",
