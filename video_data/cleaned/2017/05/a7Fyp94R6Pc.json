How can I go that next step? And it's like, I want to be here but I want to be there as well. So let's just might as well just do it and start working on it. You find what makes me happy, and this past year for me has been finding that. And then um, because when I first launched Crusher Goals, I mean I don't want to make it a Crusher Goals topic but it was just the idea of it was based on fitness, cuz that's when I first thought of it.

Uh, which is just being said like I'm going to now if it's a podcast really share what I really feel about things right? But you're going out on a limb because you're actually like you're exposing yourself to people. It's easy for me to be like, \"The Morning Show\" for instance is a very easy thing for me to do because I don't necessarily have to run an opinion on something. I can just get to go out there and be like, here's all the cool stuff that's happening in the world that we like right? It's not really my stuff but like this podcast is. I'm a little bit more exposed because you know I bring topics to the table that I want to talk about and I clearly have an opinion on um and that's a very empowering thing, but it's also double-edged sword because you know it opens up for people to disagree with you. But that's good, that's not provoking, that's real engagement with people, you.",

Just two little quick questions, sure or at least to stay on this topic so I'll go with Tim when are you going to record your first mixtape? Oh my God, we're working on it, see well we are we are we are working on it. So here's one way to put it. One of the things I like a lot is that I'm answering this question for Tim. One of the things I like about a lot of what we do is we three of us and Kevin and Andy and sometimes Cool Greg, um, we all push each other toward things, yeah. Which is good, like I've often said and I know this about myself, like I can't I could not do any creative endeavor by myself, I just I'm not the Kevin Smith of the world where I'm like I'm going to go out there\"",

Bunch of videos things like that. So it's important to see that all right. And so then I have one smaller question, but since you answered his question, I'll ask you: yeah, perfect when is Nick Scarpino going to complete his screenplay for about San Francisco or that idea? Oh interesting about San Francisco, I remember him saying something on a topic about you having this like affinity for my love letter to San Francisco, that's something along those lines, that's in the back burner. I haven't even heard it, I must have missed that. Yeah, I had an idea uh for an indie film that I by the way I have like I'm sure",

But yeah, I had this idea of kind of mirroring what I felt before I was at IGN, which was trying to touch base or find that part of everyone that's like wanting to change their life, like where you're at right now, right? You're in this job, you're in this world that you know you don't belong to anymore but you don't know how to change that. And how does that manifest itself and what would happen if you're in that state and you're on the breaking point and you just decided to go out into the city and use the city as a distraction for one night, and like what would that look",
