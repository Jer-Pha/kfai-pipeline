            "text": "What's up everybody welcome to your update on PS I Love You XOXO. I'm your only host Greg Miller. First and foremost, thank you so much to so many of you who have reached out since Colin left talking about PS I Love You wanting to know what's happening with it, uh, wanting it to go on in some shape or form. Uh, I've held off on talking about it because I wanted to center myself, find out what I wanted to do with the show, where Kinda Funny goes, what's the right move for the company, and I think we're onto it. So it's good news, bad news; stick with me. Depending on where you live, PS I Love You XOXO is going to end. Um, I thought about it for a long time, and you know when Colin announced he was leaving, my first thought was, \"We gotta end this show right.\" This show is Colin and I, and so many of you reached out saying don't do it; Colin himself said don't end it. Uh, that in the same way that like I started Beyond, this was an extension of that, so continuing that on is an extension of that as well.",

You'll find out very soon, that's all I want to say about that right now. So May 23rd me Jeremy Dunham, podcast meon founder of Rocket League Superstar VP of something the company I don't know he's a big deal over there, he'll tell me about it. I guess I could have looked it up beforehand, I didn't. I know he's a VP of something, you know his official title is VP of something, it's Jeremy Dunham that's all you need to know. So May 23rd we'll be back here with the final PS I Love You XOXO then at Kinda Funny Live June 3rd we will talk about what's next for Kinda Funny Games until then, no it's been my pleasure to serve you welcome.",
