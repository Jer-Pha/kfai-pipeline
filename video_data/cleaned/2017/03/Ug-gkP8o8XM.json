I'm Tim Gettys. I'm joined by Game Over Greggy himself, Greg Miller. What's up everybody? Good to see you. Happy tomorrow, Taco Tuesday! I saw the chat calling it out - today is the day of anniversaries. Greg, I got two very important anniversaries to tell you about. Okay, one: my little brother, Cole, wanted to make sure the world knew that it was the 13th anniversary of WrestleMania 20, his favorite day of all time. His favorite day of all time - March 14th, 2004. I think why is that the favorite day? Uh, I don't know... He really likes WrestleMania. Why? I know... Oh, just because it was great! WrestleMania had Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero.",

The years go by so fast; years go by anyway. We got on the plane and we realized we don't have a camera because no one packed it because we didn't talk to each other and are idiots, and we get there. So then we had to ask favors, and of course, millions of people were like, \"Yeah, you can borrow them.\" So we got that done. Shout out to Sean - I was going to say thank the people at IGN; they were totally cool with it. It was fine. We're a bunch of morons. A garbage truck on fire is what I mean. I love it though.

Super Data says, using data supplied to it by both Famitsu and GfK, that 500,000 consoles were sold in the US, 360,000 were sold in Japan, while Europe's not far behind; the data center tracked I'm sorry, the data tracker observed that 85k units were sold in the UK, with France managing 110,000. Most of those figures were in the first week on sale, so the number will be now be higher. Nintendo says it will aim to sell 2",
