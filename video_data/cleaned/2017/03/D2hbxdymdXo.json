What's the end of their story going to be? It's going to be bittersweet at best. You ever like, exactly we've seen it now, this movie is a downer. Like Wolverine, it starts and Logan's not in the best of places. Yeah, and you don't get the feeling after the first scene that it's only going to go downhill? Right, right, right. I was when Nick said that in the car right over here, the fact that you know he thought all X-Men movies should be like this, I was like, \"I feel like all Wolverine.\" But then talking more about it, I think it's an interesting framing for Fox to walk away with, what do we do X-Men, how do we use this universe, how do we do it and not have it be the Marvel Cinematic Universe?",

You know, yeah, it's cool, but car-like, it's cool for the action scene, but it wasn't about that right. It was about that relationship between those two and like what that meant for him and what that meant for her. You have this incredibly broken character that's coming together with this person, and like how they're going to interact. Granted, yeah, they go through and they chop up a lot of people you see in the trailers, and that's cool and that's awesome for the action sequences, but I think that that was secondary to the actual like dynamic between him and the girl, the dynamic between him and Charles which has always been",

She's a big Gambit fan, exactly, big huge Gambit fan. Yeah, of course, there were great sendoffs to Hugh Jackman, and it was... it gave you all the moments I've been waiting 17 years for - for this guy, and for Wolverine, and for what you know, somebody who reads the comics and thinks, \"What if Wolverine fought Hulk?\" and **** like that.
