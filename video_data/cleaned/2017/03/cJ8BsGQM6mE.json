Hello all the way from GDC here in San Francisco. Actually, you've been in the United States, but originally London, yes. Uh, but we discovered you uh only in game shows that we're we all at together so for as far as I know you don't actually live a life outside of andc and all these things. I am loud out into sunlight for approximately three weeks a year it's great. So I want to thank you it's F. So we're recording this on Friday, the Friday of GDC, so everything's pretty much waning now uh I I do want to thank you sincerely because I know how tired and exhausted you must be that GDC is very exhausting for developers and publishers as you're wheeling and dealing and making deals and I hope that you had a lucrative and and productive week it has been it's been good we've been here two weeks, we did Dice as well so you're ready to get the hell out of",

What great historians as well as those videos get saved. Um, I had to do I'm going to be very vague here, I had to do a specific AI job um for something we're working on um, I had to write some AI essentially and I hadn't done that kind of thing before, that that specific element of AI programming before um, and I could go back and find like three AAA games I adored from like the last five years.",

And do wonder just from a practical level, it affects people on a human level, but on a commercial level, since that's what we're talking about as games, certainly that must have a negative ramification for sure. I mean, it's worth saying when I talk about the the he days of about six months ago when uh traveling to America felt like a train journey, that's me saying that as a white guy right; like I I breeze through airport security um except for when I tried to take a Steam box through like Poland and I had to explain to them how all the Steam games work.",

And I'm wondering if it's a positive thing - it's a really interesting question and it's a nuanced one, right? That's the thing. I mean, are we starting from this point that everything is political? Is that something we absolutely agree with? So you're talking specifically about the discourse. My view is that I think politics are a fascinating lens to talk about and look at games - I think we can learn a lot about games, and I think make games better.

And I think both of those in theory having uh better discussions about games, I think is useful. I think in terms of um, you know they're art and they should be treated like art. And we we I think often as an industry we want games to be considered art because we we know that that's a high feting thing that will make us less embarrassed when we talk about playing them at parties with people who don't play games. Like it's like they mean more than you think, yeah exactly. Like actually uh video games are art.

Honestly, I think everyone's talking politics more than they were. I think that's just a trend that's occurred. I think as well, the specific means by which we consume media pushes us towards um going down our channel - right, like finding people who agree with us and communicating with them and reading them and knowing them. My my I actually have to actively work now to get my internet experience to have viewpoints that are not like laser-focused on my my political views.

I think so. I always say my top tip to an indie developer is to release your game in 2012, that's like my first bit of advice because that's when Thomas Was Alone came out and Thomas Was Alone was a big deal, just to give you an example, Ori.

They would vote 12 to nothing to put it on the store. That's incredibly optimistic. Well, just because because I don't think they have to be the curator of being like this game my only question and it's an amorphous question that suggests that there's some sort of objectivity in judging a game which I don't know if exists is does this game does this game belong here and is it for someone is it reasonable that someone wants this game",
