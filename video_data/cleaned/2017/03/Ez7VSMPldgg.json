So that happened; we worked really hard to nail the art style and turn this headless or sort of realistic-looking and creepy snake into something cute and colorful. And when we brought it to EGX Rezzed's first time, we showed it to the public for the first time, the reaction was just amazing \u2013 like there were smiley faces all around; everybody that looked at it wanted to play it, there were queues around the booths all the time, and we had our big boss standing in the corner with a big smile. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right away on automatic, yeah, exactly. So that pretty much the day after EGX Rezzed was finished, they came over and said, \"We're going into full production; you've got it.\"",
