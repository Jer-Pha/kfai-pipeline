Freaking Soldier Boy starts to come up on a Segway behind me in line, so now you can't beat that. So now me and Soldier Boy are standing in line about to go do Halo, and this freaking Snoop Dog comes in. Me, Snoop Dog - they know what's up. This never happens in the demos I've been booking at E3. So me, Snoop, right? Cuz y'all gave me that demo; y'all were like, \"Go check it out.\" Yeah, we booked your entire thing. Yeah, so I went over there and I did it, and it's freaking Snoop Dog - I already knew Snoop, but that was my first time meeting Soulja Boy. But the fact that we're all in there shooting each other in the face on Halo, not to mention the HoloLens thing that they let us do first was freaking awesome because it was augmented reality. Right?

You can't believe every moment that goes by, you cannot believe you're actually playing this game in bed or wherever. That's the only reason I didn't get the Pro Controller - because I didn't want to get spoiled. Yeah, and I'm like, going back and forth - that was my thing.
