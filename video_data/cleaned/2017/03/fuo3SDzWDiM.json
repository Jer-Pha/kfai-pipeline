I hope that in the same way you get to know these characters and think of them as like people that you could know in your real life and about what happens to them. But also, you know, I don't think it's on our checklist to be like \"and how do we make people cry twice as hard.\" But um, but I I I think that when you have a game like this, you give people access to all the evidence of people's kind of personal lives and you flesh that out. Hopefully, it's natural to like make a connection with them. Well, what I find fascinating just from the you the demo we did or the let's play we did is the fact that you know like I made a joke in",
