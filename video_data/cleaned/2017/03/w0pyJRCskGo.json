We just might friend yeah we're pointing out yeah this React Monster by Amazon and Bethesda. So you take everything we say with a grain of salt, worth pointing out I think we only took the deal because you played Far Cry. We already... we like they're like yeah Holly they're going to go to some money i thought to get a little while ago. I like that I brought it back. We do the let's play was look cool yeah you showed me you you showed your first playthrough all right you see my computer like wow that came back a pretty cool neck maybe you do have a good table yeah yeah well I'll go that far I know that game was really cool",

We have better. We played hardware labs right, it's an extension of that. You're still on the space station for not too far off, takes like a little bit from where I want you hours, yeah. If you haven't, I think it screamed hours at your disposal, right? These alien powers and when I was dug so much about the original let's play we did was alright cool, it's cerebral what's happening this awesome soundtrack all these other things are happening and that's rad but it gave me that Bioshock feel next to get to play it now and have it be an even more science fiction yeah like I'm running around.

And so you can use it to get the drops and use it in a different way. Yes, what's up? Can you really have a better sense that you can use them more efficiently is because we're not forced to be in a constant back-and-forth, us right? One of the cool things about the game was cool when I really talk about it. I know this is such a buzzword term thing... like \"please wait, you're lame.\" Yeah, it was the fact that there was a door being blocked by an electrical panel that was parked right and had had a you know originally saying that if you have that leveled up, you can go in there six pack.

All of a sudden, you have to go make a zero-g like booster pack. Let's talk about that, because I like that content. Of your side, obviously, final stuff on the world you cross paths for the way you do it is by storing them into this gigantic recycler right, that like reassembles the molecules and spits out these little tiny cubes and whatnot materials. Yeah, wrong, and then you take those over and it'll 3D print from them anything you have if you have the blueprint for that thing. You can go, that includes ammo, gun, and this would be a jetpack. You can use it now to jump high, jump but more importantly in zero-g, you go out into space and you can do that. It's very hard to do in here. Geez, heart disease me up, and I like what big ups for me was like we're about to go outside into the space station.

Like if you get it has a little speedometer, and if it gets into the red, what that means is if you get something, you're gonna take damage. My gardener show so you're going to get the Jackal damaged right away. If I thought because usually when you want to do something, you want free space walk in the game - that's not really about space walking; it is are you looking to buy your O2? You only have so much good oxygen otherwise your heart's gonna start beating fast. There's a guy I don't know, I don't like him - he's a portal answer, they had an oxygen on the moon or whatever right this doesn't have that.
