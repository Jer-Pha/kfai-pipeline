We're not writing anything actually, uh, and The Saga surrounding what happened to Gawker and the demise of Gawker is very controversial. So one of the most controversial things I've seen happen to a publication maybe ever, um, so I want to catch you guys up on basically what has happened and then get your opinions on what happened because this is a very divisive subject. The basic gist of it is that Gawker.com, which is the flagship of Gawker, Gawker owned or owned until a few days ago, Deadspin and Kotaku and Gizmodo and Jalopnik and I9 and all these sites; so uh, I think they owned I9, yeah, yeah.

But what happened basically is, is controversial because a billionaire basically funded a lawsuit to put them out of business, like specifically designed to put them out of business, this is a billionaire who had been slighted by them exactly.

The decision comes just two days after Univision won an auction to acquire Gawker Media, the parent company of gawker.com as well as websites like Gizmodo and Lifehacker. It might seem surprising for Univision to spend $130 million for the company and then immediately shutter its flagship brand but the business logic behind the decision seems pretty clear. The Gawker.com brand has become so toxic that continuing to operate the site could have posed significant financial risks, shuttering gawker.com will allow Univision to get a fresh start; other Gawker media sites will apparently continue operating and Univision's management will be able to focus their full energies on them and what we basically heard I think is that 95% of",

Um, what am I doing there? We go uh, so it says Gawker's sensationalistic journalism brought about its downfall. Gawker Media's path to bankruptcy began with a decision by Gawker.com editors to publish a video of Hulk Hogan having sex without the permission of either Hogan or his partner. Hogan sued, arguing that this was a violation of his privacy; a Florida jury agreed, awarding Hogan $140 million in damages earlier this year. Gawker didn't have $140 million, so the company was forced to declare bankruptcy. The company was put up for auction with the proceeds used to pay part of Hogan's judgment.",

The company was put up for auction with the proceeds used to pay part of Hulk Hogan's judgment. We didn't know it at the time, but Hogan's lawsuit was secretly funded by technology billionaire Peter Thiel. Thiel has borne a grudge against Gawker since 2007 when Gawker published a post titled \"Peter Thiel is gay.\" Thiel started to look for opportunities to punish Gawker for what he saw as irresponsible journalism. These were not isolated incidents. Gawker had outed others, including CNN anchor Anderson Cooper and Shepard Smith of Fox News, in one of its most infamous stories. Gawker reported on a New York media executive soliciting the services of a male escort. The man was not a public figure, and the piece was later removed after founder Nick Denton decided that the story had gone over the ethical line.

Gawker isn't the only publication to be targeted by a disgruntled billionaire last year the liberal magazine Mother Jones defeated a defamation lawsuit filed by Republican donor Frank VanderSloot, winning the lawsuit cost Mother Jones and its insurance company $2.5 million in legal fees if VanderSloot's goal was to punish Mother Jones for writing an accurate but unflattering story about him, a loss was almost as good as a victory; his lawsuit sought $74,999, staying just under the $75,000 threshold that would have allowed Mother Jones to move the case into federal court and away from an Idaho jury that might have favored the hometown plaintiff so winning the lawsuit cost Mother Jones and its insurance companies 30 times as much as the",

And as far as I know, no one has taken him up on the offer, but the threat of freedom of the press is obvious: any news organization doing its job is going to make some enemies; if a wealthy third party is willing to bankroll lawsuits by anyone with a grudge, and defending each case could cost millions of dollars, the organization could get driven out of business even if it wins every single lawsuit.

Instead, he waited for years until he could find other plaintiffs with stronger cases. That's a tactic any billionaire could use against any news organization, and because most news organizations cover a wide variety of topics, the story that provoked a billionaire's ire might have nothing to do with the stories that actually trigger a lawsuit funded by that billionaire.

We could go see a movie right now.\" No, so they're like, \"Well, where can we go?\" And of course the next answer no matter what is inevitably going to be bad again on Thursday night with 12 people.

People that don't think that way and just think burgers are just food right; they do look at cookies as like that's something that I shouldn't have too much of. Sure, I think majority of people eat as much Burgers as they **** want - that's true, that's right, true. It's it's strange though because I don't I don't have an aversion to sweetness; like I like Coca-Cola for instance, yeah, I like I I do finish often finish dinners nice dinners with espresso which I like and I don't even like coffee which is the interesting thing - espresso is like super strong coffee. I like just I feel like it just helps me digest so I just have a weird rule set but I remember even like it's always been this way with Halloween.",
