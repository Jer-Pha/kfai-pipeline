Yeah, again, that was exactly my perception as well, which was it was similar to uh uh The Ghostbusters documentary that we watched, I think you're in, I'm in Ghostheads, Ghostheads, yeah, which was I went in expecting it to be a pretty like a documentary about Ghostbusters, um, and it was more about the fans of Ghostbusters, which was you know still a good documentary but it's just not what I wanted necessarily. Um, but yeah, but I guess the broader question then is let's just talk about Back to the Future for a little while. Absolutely, a perfect fantastic movie, uh-huh, period. Saying perfect trilogy that's crazy... talk that I can't believe you just came out of your goddamn mouth. Well, so here's the reason I say that is like, you know, no but yes, I'm two and three obviously have their faults, but I think in terms of one being just a great movie.",

I didn't know that and they totally **** canned the original uh girlfriend and brought in Elizabeth's shoe. They didn't **** can or she quitting didn't they also **** can. Oh I I see what you're saying but before they even released the film then they already have a different Marty too, and then oh yeah well the mar yeah they shot like a good portion of that's so incredible yeah so so weird, weird thing must been so expensive.

But growing up watching those, I definitely had that feeling of Back to Future two - I would fight to the death, it's better than one. Oh yeah, and Secret of the Ooze - I would fight to the death, it's better than the first one. But then it's like, when you do watch later, you're like, well, I'm absolutely wrong. The sequence in TMNT2 where they're fighting over the Ooze Pile in that lobby is awesome. I'll give them that - jump off, they freeze and say \"tur\" that was awesome.

I went on a weird journey yesterday on the way home and I was like, I'm in a great mood, I'm gonna listen to some Vanilla Ice; he's coming back. And at one point, Vanilla Ice in his seminal song \"Ice Ice Baby\" says, \"I'm gonna grab my nine.\" I don't think that really happened; I don't think he ever did grab his N. I don't think any **** went down that required him to grab a nine, unless it was a nine iron on the links. Sure, you think we can get Vanilla Ice in the show? I **** guarantee we could get him on this show; let's do it. I don't think we could, but he had a rap rock album in the late 90s, yeah, \"Too Cold\" \u2013 that he remade, \"Ice Baby,\" renamed it \"Too Cold.\"",

Fox and Lorraine and George and their old people I'm like oh okay and then when they went back to the back in time and they were young I was like how are they doing this what are they up to never thought they were taking young actors and actresses aging them up look old so I I don't want to be the contrarian here but I will uh Back to the Future great movie I think apart from",

That's an evergreen movie but predominantly it was about John Hughes making a commentary about what it was to be a teen in that era of the '80s very reflective so there's there's a lot of nostalgia baked into that right is that it was it was a sign of its time like it was. That movie has been remade multiple times, but you have to rely heavily on the circumstances of well I guess not necessarily for The Breakfast Club. I guess that is kind of evergreen. I take that back, Ferris Bueller is a little bit more I guess sign of the times, but for The Breakfast Club, I don't know maybe you both those movies I think are there you're cuz as a kid you can you can uh drop in either you can but but I'm going to take back what I just said because I I do feel like I feel like if you",

And so to me, like I always thought, that's one of those where you watch it at the end, you're like, \"God, I just wish there was like one more minute of this right or or or we could watch another one.\" And then it's slow. You want to get to Back to the Future 2 and then you're like, \"God damn it,\" my only other recourse now is Back to the Future 3, which we all can agree is not the best in the trilogy. Um, but I'm going to watch it anyway because you know it's more of these characters that I love, it's more of this time traveling gimmick.

And I think that you know Back to the Future kind of did that. It made us really think about time travel, like it was was definitely the thing that got me thinking about if we were to go back in time how would that affect things, and like that first time I had that conversation in my head uh it reminds me of Inception a lot where it's like that movie gave us something to think about and think about the rules that that movie has to fit in. It's like we want more now. Inception I think is a good thing we don't get more, but with Back to the Future I think that that movie ending and then yeah going going to the future in the second one going to the past and the third one all made sense because it wasn't serious you know",

And Back to the Future, the original right, they do that in such a condensed thing where you know you're talking about it being a nostalgia part to then this fantastical part of like that whole first part of that movie of Marty and Jennifer, and she's going to babysit and she writes on the flyer",
