Like, it's a fun, clever little game. I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that it was one of The Proving Grounds for the viability of the downloadable platform, and Inside is so clever. You can tell why it took a long time to make because obviously they're a small team, and they have the money to take their time. Limbo's on everything, and they made a **** ton of money, but um I like how there's nothing in the game that happens by chance, and this is - and this is a fact that nothing's coincidental in the game, everything's there for a reason, and obviously in a linear game like that, that's easy to do in premise, but designing an",

It's specifically when you're like walking um with a bunch of people in a la and I was like it's very simple and it's super creepy and it opens that part of the game opens the story up in a very specific way if you pay attention. But I'm like this is so this takes a high level of like game knowhow to make a game like this and nuance, it's all about nuance and I love how every death in the game is not even in a in a AAA well received game like Uncharted 4 Drake's falling off a cliff and he clips through the world and there's like a scream that you heard five times that's it right or in Metal Gear Solid Games always the snake or whatever but it's like it just goes and that's you know then like you know the game over thing whatever but um in this like if you die on this screen someone",

It's like there's three ways to die here, and each of those is like a very designed specific way to die, it's not brutal too yeah. And I'm like, I'm like it's so cool, this game is really cool. There's another part of the game uh where you pull a switch and if you just wait, wait for minutes like there's no reason to wait but if you just wait for minutes on end you see these guys pull out a machine and like it literally takes probably two minutes they eventually wheel out this thing and then turn it on and then it eventually just finds you. So like you can leave the game just sitting there for like five minutes and then eventually it'll kill you um, and so I was not knowing how it ends and all.",

Like I really don't know, like I really have no idea, like what I... I have no assumption of what it what it even is. And um, I just think it's an absolute master class in game design. Like this is exactly what I'm talking about when I say like the the the answers to our problems in gaming do not come from necessarily power of the machine but from clever minds that work within the confines of what we already have. And this game doesn't even need a PS4 or Xbox One to run, and uh they might have to draw back the graphics whatever it wouldn't make the game any less you know any less awesome.

Um so it's kind of hard to think back, it's like 20 years ago. Um so yeah those kind of games, Mega Man Legends specifically reminds me of that era because it was a birthday gift from my brother who came home from Philadelphia in October. And Tales of Destiny same thing I got it for my birthday, like birthday games generally will remind me of that too, same thing with records and stuff like that that I listen to so um so yeah and then of",

I would have paid more for Gone Home, and that's the whole thing.

Is different than it's Overwatch, where you're going to play it over and over and over again - or there's a reason for it, even if it's an Uncharted that I know I'm going to go back three times to platinum or whatever. Like, that's replayability versus hours of how long a game is, yeah. In that case, I might take the hours of gameplay out of my like, that's necessary - like, that makes it worth $60, I think.

So, like how long does a game stay with you, and and that might that might correlate with replayability, that might correlate with hours played. But um it's more along the lines of like how much do you want to play it as opposed to how much are you going to or can you play it. Um, I think that that's a a relevant point, and then the resonance, like how much does it stay with you and stick with you, and like and and occupy your mind.

So and this is what I've got into in the past where I think we have to there needs to be a more exploratory nature in terms of uh pricing of games. I do think games can and should probably cost more than $60 sometimes, and I think that games often need to not cost $60. I think games that are being that people are paying $60 for uh sometimes are not $60 games.

Why isn't that an $80 or $100 game? And I know that some people scoff at that, but are you not getting your money's worth, you know? Like, so uh, so I think it has to go both ways. And I would explore that. So, I think the $60 game model - I think that model will only persist as long as retail stores exist. Once that and we might end up paying $70, just like we used to. I mean, a lot of people don't even know probably because a lot of people are newer to games or they're younger - like we used to pay $50 for games before that. We would often pay between $40 and $80 or $100 for games, depending on the cartridge.",

That was when we would often pay between 40 and 80 dollars or even $100 for games depending on the cartridge size, because of how big the chips were. So we're in a good spot with $60 games now, because $60 games are extremely cheap compared to the games we grew up with - extremely cheap, the cheapest they've been ever. In fact, I did a piece on IG a long time ago called \"The Real Cost of Gaming.\" People can go check that out where I did all the math on how much games actually cost, and it turns out that today's games are actually cheaper than they've ever been. But uh, I feel like games could get even cheaper, and I think games can get even more expensive. But I think the thing that you... it's the intangibles that matter the most. I don't think you can look into and be like, \"Our graphics are definitely not most important.\" Our gameplay is very important, but I think that goes to the stickiness - mhm uh hours played and",

So I think it's these more intangible terms that you have to use, and I think it's going to change because if you say well, the 20 hour pre-the 20 hour point of this game is a reason why this is worth $60, and then I can just push you another game, then I'm like, well, this game's 20 hours, why doesn't it matter? Here, you have to use more vague language, I guess, is what I'm saying in terms of like what what strikes you than these these kind of like \"prish\" you know bullet points of like you know does does multiplayer matter?

It's the same thing with Brazil; remember you guys watch it all the time I talk about Brazil why things are so expensive in Brazil, and I asked you guys to tell me why and I was right, I might not be right about this one but let me know in the comments. Um, my assumption is that they're able to eat that because the like basically uh what is it like 70 to 30 split or whatever between the licensor and the licenser um on consoles so Nintendo just keeps all that money so basically they're just making a little bit less like that like they don't have to take a rip from themselves so I think they're able to charge less for themselves I just think that",

I wonder man, I I I still think it was doomed from the start just based on its library and what it, the direction that it went, like they're kind of doing what Sony is doing now in the sense of like they really focus on the more obscure games, like the RPGs and the really Japanese stuff, and people love those games but not enough people buy those games.

I am one of what now feels like a minority, but I'm definitely not where I don't care for the Dreamcast at all; I don't have these fond memories about it, and I think that in a lot of ways they ruined a lot of franchises on that system.

But um, SEGA, they were attempting, they were desperate, and if they showed a little less desperation and a little more quality control, I think what killed the Dreamcast too was that like you could flagrantly pirate games like it, it was a it was a not even with BleemCast and all that kind of stuff, like you could just do whatever the **** you want. It was it was like an incredible there was nothing on that machine that was stopping people from doing it, and I think that was another reason why the PS1 was also extremely easy to use a spring and put something in the parallel port and all that kind of stuff, it was a little it was a little harder some.",

Matterfall, the game coming from Housemarque, the people who did Resogun, Dead Nation, and Exit the Gungeon. This is their game; they announced it, I don't know when, last year at PSX. No, I don't remember where they announced it. The trailer showed a guy with a gun running as things are happening around him or whatever.

Luma dream says what Sony franchises should get the Pok\u00e9mon Go treatment my pick would be Ape Escape Jesus I mean Invisible is already there it was it you n of yet you all slept on Invisible you didn't help it on the PSP or the Vita so that's what's so funny is that Invisible actually is literally doing what Pok\u00e9mon Go does now but I never give a flying **** about Invisible so I didn't even know well because it was because it wasn't easy right it was booted up do this by the camera have",

Another one that I mean for real, for in for a mobile game, for them to make not in Pok\u00e9mon Go thing, but Buzz, so that Buzz Studio shut down, but I don't think not a I don't think it needs to be nearly as complicated right as just a trivia game you play and you sync up your friends there and stuff.

No. It could get canceled away tomorrow, and like the industry wouldn't be rocked to its core or something, but it's a cool place to debut a cool trailer and talk about an announcement, and then sit here and go, \"Hey, we like these people, and we're going to honor them.\" And it still is that the board is made up of people from IGN and GameStop and all those different you know sites that have an editorial voice. That's cool. Yeah, exactly. I don't think it needs to happen. I don't think a lot of things need to happen, but I think that this show happens.

People talking about video games on this level, like Greg Miller's winning an award for being the trending gamer, which means what you know, but then but when you think about it though it's like that it's explaining that type of stuff though it's teaching people that oh story in a game is something that deserves an award, oh soundtrack is something that video games have you know and it's I feel like we all know that right but",

Like Game Awards now are like that's something I'm looking forward to at the end of the year because we get announcements out of that. There's very few things every year now that we get a whole bunch of announcements and where you're expecting surprises, the only other thing is E3, yeah, besides that it's like Gamescom, TGS, PSX, like all the conferences of which now there's one every single month you can kind of expect what we're going to get from all of those.
