You've played it a whole bunch yeah. You've talked about it a lot Greg. You did multiple Let's Plays and streams. I've done let's plays. I've done streams. I've done panels over many Paxes. Have I been saying it wrong all the time? I say DEA sex and you're saying Deus Ex. I used to say Deus X really. I say de yeah. Deus X is it de X is it short?

It might be D-X, d mean now you say it and like he says it and he knows a whole bunch of random facts. It could be D, you say d is there anyone that we can like figure this out? Yeah I'm sure we have friends that work on the game get get on it anyways well Greg's doing that yeah I want I want Kinda Funny to do a review discussion of this game you know you know how we I don't know if you knew this Nick but we do reviews over here games I want to know should people play this what do you think about it how does it compare to um Human Revolution that came out last generation give me your thoughts yeah so human I think it's a uh definitely",

It's one of the reasons why I was drawn to Human Revolution originally, just because I like the style of it, and I was like, \"Oh, I want to kind of...\" every once in a while I'll jump into a game that I know I'm going to be in for like you know 10 to 20 hours. Um, largely I usually play games at about four to five hours 'cause I have the attention span of a gnat, but um, every once in a while I throw myself into these, which is funny because Greg even commented when when I first started playing let's play he like this is the strangest game for you to play because it takes a lot",

And Square is confirming Deux Ex okay because I was like, man, that seems like something someone would have corrected me on at the 30 Days of SX panels I've done over the last three years makes sense. So we will say that from now on let's all say it together: D'he's the only one saying it weird. You were right, you were right. There I I'm more on the Tim front. D I just wanted we could have thrown him under the bus but you for your little boyfriend every um yeah no I mean I think it to answer your original question I think it holds up very well obviously I think it's a fitting sequel or I guess it's what is the third or fourth still sequel yeah I guess it's a sequel in the series so um I liked it a lot it's it's it's gorgeous the game design is",

Um but I'm going back now because I'm tanked up, like a ****, like I'm just like all my guns are leveled up, all my augs are leveled up.

Uh well the controls are completely different okay so you can right when it starts it asks you if you want to do the new control scheme or the Human Revolution and pick the new one it's it's much better largely because I think uh if I remember correctly in Human Revolution you had to click in one of the sticks to aim and that was the worst. Now it takes a little getting used to and that's one of that's one of my only gripes about the actual control scheme is that the two cover you have to click in the stick which when you're in a firefight inevitably you end up vaulting over **** for the first like three hours of the game and getting your head shot off sure um because",

So you can't really remember what's going on, and then you're set up as working for one organization, and you're a sleeper in another organization trying to get to a third organization that may or may not be a good organization. Yeah, because they might be a puppet of another organization that might be tied to this Illuminati group.

You might not get a boss battle; it's crazy. Stuff like that's really cool. I'm going to be honest with you; I use the guide probably about 20% of the time. Like, I'd log on just kind of make sure I didn't [cuz] I wasn't sure I wanted to do another game after this. And I'm glad I did because a lot of those other things I would never have even thought with my style of play; I would never have happened upon them. A lot of them literally, like you have to sneak up on people and listen to their conversations, and they'll be like, \"Oh, this thing's hidden over here.\" Oh great! And obviously, you don't know that's not timing-wise; it's triggered by you going up to them. But if that person has a giant hole in their head because you just put a shotgun to their mouth.",

I don't want to do this anymore like I was kind of burned out. Sure, okay. Um, you know, you go back and play for like five more minutes in the level and screw around, and you're like... it just feels empty. Whereas there's so much more to do in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided right now that I'm like, \"Oh, cool!\" And I want to kind of want to play through the story the whole story again to see if I can get a better ending because I'm lot, but I've already... already started **** that up already. I've already gotten into a fight with the cops in Prague, which is probably wanted man right now. Now what are you going to do? They got cool ****. Got to live. Got to be Adam Jensen.

Absolutely I mean if you're a fan of the series or if you're actually just jumping in, you could probably I would say play Human Revolution first but if you don't have the patience for that, I completely understand. I would read a summation of that, yeah, read the Wikipedia page and then jump in. They do a really good job of sort of like... like right at the beginning obviously they tell you the big thing that happened in Human Revolution and how where the world's at right now. You get a sense of it. And spoilers, it's not a Utopia and I don't think anyone's expecting that but yeah definitely jump in play it if that's the kind of game for me it's great it's not that hardcore it it doesn't have that like hardcore RPG experience",
