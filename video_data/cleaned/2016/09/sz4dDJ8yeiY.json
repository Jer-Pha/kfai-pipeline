            "text": "Hi, I'm Nick. Yep. I'm sorry for the unintentional touch. Yeah. I mean, I didn't mean I just I saw your arms across the room and you were working out over there and I just thought maybe I don't know, you might want to hang out with me sometime and absolutely grab a cup of coffee and then No. Appreciate the offer. Okay. She got a phone call. So, so I'm just going to go over here and uh rage against my **** wall right here. Not even a phone. Damn. So, Gavin Nick, today's question comes from 27-year-old Gavin. Another Gavin out there. He wants to know of my exact age. You're 27? I am. Oh my god. He wants to know simply, how do I ask a girl out? Nick, you're married. I am married which means that I successfully did it at least once. Um I think that this one's a hard question but ultimately it boils down to confidence right if you are confident if you're having fun if you're in an environment that is conducive to this then you should be able to feel good about walking up to a a",

And if the conversation starts going well you might want to continue that over a cup of coffee sometime or dinner. It doesn't have to be any lines. Don't use any stupid like stickicks. That's the key though. It's be direct. Like don't play games and don't do weird things where it's like I don't know if I want like does she like me? Does she not like me? If you want to go out, ask her out and she'll say yes or no and you'll know. There's no question after that. But you know, it's so ballsy though. It is. But you got to build up to it. I'm so scared of rejection that I want to be like almost 100% sure she'll say yes. So I just go like full slow burn. I just like wait it out works out two",

I just wait it out and it works out two weeks later. I'm like, \"Oh, this is a guarantee. Like, I definitely got this.\" But there's something to be said for that, right? There are certain situations you should just stay away from asking out, right? No woman likes to be hit on at the gym. So don't ask a girl out if she's working out and you're working out. Yeah. Most women just don't like that. Um, from my experience, I'm sure there's someone out there who's like, \"I hope someone would talk to me when I'm at 24 Hour Fitness.\" But when they're at the gym, it's a very vulnerable time. People are sweating. They're not at their best. Just stay away from that, right? If",

            "text": "They're not at the best. Just stay away from that, right? Uh, in the supermarket, don't start a conversation with someone while they're looking searching, like you said, shopping for produce. Okay? If you're at a party amongst friends and you get introduced to someone, that's the time exploring. That's when you're supposed to do it. Weddings are great. Social experiences, you know, like that's where you want to do it. I think uh this this question comes up a lot when I look through the questions you guys send over at Kinda Funny.com/loveandsex. And uh so many people ask about what if someone like there's this girl at this fast food place that I'm like I'm in love with and it's like no you're not like she works the drive-thru dude and it's like she doesn't know you do not ask her out. You were talking about the gym and stuff. I feel like they're in a very vulnerable place there. When they're at their place of employment, you need to stay away because you don't want them",

When they're at their place of employment, you need to stay away because you don't want them to feel uncomfortable. You know what I mean? What if they're giving you like major eye contact? They're like, \"Well, I mean that's the thing.\" All the rules go out the window if you feel like it's a 100% chance. Yeah. But even then, like you have to be sure because like when they're at their job, like that's a very bad thing to mess up, right? Because Americans are friendly as hell. You wouldn't in England where everyone's like rude unless they like you, right? Yeah. I mean, let's put it this way. If you get your Starbucks cup back and it's got a little heart on it, that might be a good indication that that person wants to talk to you a little more. If the conversation keeps going but then you have to just be very subtly direct",

If the conversation keeps going and but then you have to just be very very subtly direct and I know those two guys are good, but don't don't mix words be like hey you know you're really cool you want to hang out sometime and if she says no be like cool no problem and then never go back to that Starbucks. Yeah. I mean that's the thing is when you're asking someone that at a place where they work, it's like it's putting them in an awkward situation cuz then they never are going to want to deal with you again. The moment you walk out, they're going to talk to their friend \"that guy\" this guy and that's super it's super awkward for everyone involved. So you you want to be able to go to any Starbucks you want. You don't want to limit your Starbucks. Have you ever done like the phone number dump like on a on a waitress you just like leave it or whatever? Yeah. I know a",

Have you ever done like the phone number dump like on a on a waitress you just like leave it or whatever? Yeah. I know a friend who keeps doing that and no one ever calls them. Yeah. That's the thing is like that's that that lacks the confidence. That's cockiness, not confidence. And that's bad, you know, I say it's just coward. That too. I mean, it's all it's all of that. It's just that's not going to work for you. And if it does work, that's not a good sign overall because you're treating it like a business card. Like you could be you could be doing that all over. Tossing it everywhere. And that's that's definitely not it's very personal. Mhm. And I also think the big thing is don't go out with a grand gesture. Like you think it's like because you you've been building this up in your head forever where you're like, I see this person, I'm in love with this person or not even that crazy. I have a crush on",

I have a crush on this person. Whatever. They don't know who the hell you are. So going up to them and telling them \"I've been thinking about you.\" I ordered, you know, a venti latte from Starbucks for the last four months and every morning it's what I'm looking forward to in the morning. Like they're not going to have a body pillow with your face on it. No, they don't want to hear that. Not good. That **** ain't good. Just, you know, be cool. Be you. So let's go over this one more time, okay? Make sure it's the right time, right place. Make sure you strike up a conversation and build a rapport with someone. And then when it comes time, be simple and direct. I like you. I'd like to hang out with you sometime. Can I have your phone number? All you got to do is be confident.",

Confidence is important. And uh if you're like me and you don't have any, just fake it. Faking things, I mean, they don't know is the key to success. Fake it till you make it.
