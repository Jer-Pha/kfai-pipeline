Black Bean Society of Chicago still popping off in Chicago. The BBS of Chicago. I got to be honest with you guys, I uh, I disagree with the lemon key lime pie is pretty good. Key lime Pie's good, but pie in general is not my go-to. Uh, much more of a cake guy. Love the red velvet cake. You're saying red velvet cake is the best dessert? I would say that is the dessert that I... If you're saying Nick, it's your birthday, you're going to eat carbs for this one day, you're going to go get Taco Bell first, and then afterward you can have whatever you want.
