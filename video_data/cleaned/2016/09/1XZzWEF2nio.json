They were light-looking people. One of them was incredibly tall. Taller than any man has any right to be. And I saw him sitting on the table and what was bad is, I mean there was an absence of one of the boxes underneath it, like one of the rolling cards. That was what I thought. If it broke, it would land on that. But he's still going to get a shard of particle board right up his anus. And that would have been bad. That would have been a bad look for us.

What does this self-driving car do? I would imagine there's a sense of ownership over the tech itself. That's like the two people in the car bought this thing that is trying to make this decision. So I would imagine it would choose owners over these, you know, to save the owners, five dumb people who are taking their sweet ass time. But do you think that's the right choice? I don't think either is the right choice. And those accusatory eyes are not going to do what you think they're going to do. But I mean, there's morals here. Like there, a decision has to be made.

You go with scenario one, because by the time the car gets there, those people will be behind the barricade. If I was to say hit the barricade, the people would be by the barricade and then we'd all die at once. So I think this is a case closed. The skulls mean death, GameOverGreggy. The skulls mean death.

Right. And the fact that this is something, if I were a writer to sit down and be like, this is a great story that I'm going to tell. No way would this ever happen in real life except that it did.

So there is, we do have a fascination and I think that's what this documentary does, is like telling that human condition of like, this person has fallen from grace and now they're climbing back and we can forgive even though I don't believe we should be really necessarily forgiving our public figures for smoking crack with prostitutes or cheating on their wives.

He didn't text back. And 8:30, he called me and was apologetic, but barely spoke English, but he was coming. And it was the weirdest thing I remember.

What we didn't know is that beginning at 10 p.m. and lasting until 4 a.m., large gravel trucks would pass directly by our campsite every three to five minutes going up and down the road. It was the equivalent of camping on a freeway. Needless to say, I didn't sleep for two nights.

And I go all the way through it, to you know how you gotta pee, you gotta pee, you gotta pee, and then it's just like, you don't have to pee anymore. Now the pain is so intense, that's just life. And then the movie ended and we got up and I had to walk back hunched over, because it hurt so much, and then I finally got into the RV, got to the toilet, and then I had to sit there for like 30 seconds warming everything up, getting this machine ready to run. That's the worst, is when you have to pee and it hurts a little bit, because you held it in for so long and almost nothing comes out, and you're like, what the, and you have to give it about another 20 minutes and then it's like, all right, we're",

I've been camping, but I agree with Tim where it's like, it's fun in your mind. I mean, there are people clearly that enjoy it really. My dad's one of those people too. My dad always would kid around.

But, so he likes doing those kinds of things, but honestly, and it's kind of sad, my camper day camper summer camp stories, or one of them is when I was in private school, we would go for a week to this thing called Nature's Classroom, which was like, I lived in New Hampshire and we'd go to upstate New Hampshire like Laconia or something like that, and go to this thing and I went and I fucking hated it. So the second year I demanded the stay and four kids in eighth grade at that time all stayed. I just played Apple II games for a week, so that was cool. But the other, the, the, a little bit of that, Chip's Challenge? Yeah, Chip's Challenge, yeah, I played like Oregon Trail and like Jeopardy where it had, yeah, like it has like 25 questions.

But honestly, and it's kind of a sad thing, like one of my camping memories, I've been between third and fourth grade, I had left Long Island to go live with my mom in Maine for a few years and she worked, she worked at Delta, so I went to this summer camp and it was like the only time in my life, I was kind of always flown to the radar in school, like I wasn't a popular kid, but I was just kind of like normal person, you know? And it was the only time in my life I remember getting picked on like every day. That's not good.

That's what I remember about that experience. Like I don't remember anything else like that whole summer, but that kid, like busting my balls all the time. Do you fantasize sometimes that you go back and just punch him in his fucking face? No, I fantasize sometimes about just seeing him now and him being a fucking complete loser. Would you be surprised if he was like, Forbes Fortune 500, I'd be shocked. He's a really nice guy. He was missing a chromosome. I would be shocked if he even graduated high school, to be fair, honestly. So that's what I remember about those kinds of things. I love hiking. Like I really love being in the woods.

Because Long Island's getting really overrun and like these guys like try to buy land and be like, just get the fuck out of here. There's a lot of NIMBYism on Long Island, which is fine. And NIMBY - I don't know what that means. No, I have no idea. NIMBY is an acronym for \"not in my backyard.\" And so like people that are like, just stay the fuck off the island. You have no reason to be here. And there's these guys, you know, these very nice people that my friend, my best friend Mike's mom works for. Mike Pope? Yep.

I was like, this is a supply. Lucky to get Lyme disease. No, I used to get poison ivy all the time, which is like, I don't, is there even poison ivy out here? Cause like I don't see it like in- You got poison- You got poison- Oh great, and poison sumac and shit like that. Like on, dude, it is, on Long Island, it is everywhere. Like it is everywhere. You're at 7-Eleven, you grab a bag of fucking T-Nose out and it just hits you. I used to get it, I used to get it fucking constantly when I was a kid. And we had an in-ground pool.

It's this like stuff that you buy that you can like rub on yourself and then like basically like put your hands like and weed and stuff like that and like you don't get it. So anyway, I lived in fear of that shit as well. So I tried to stay out of there, but when I'm in the woods here, I don't notice it. I see it when I'm back home, like ever. When I was at the wedding in Connecticut for Mike Pope in the middle of nowhere in Cornwall, Connecticut, we were going into the woods. It was like a very like a Game of Thrones. Like I told you guys, it was like, he like shot a, literally shot a flaming arrow into this bonfire to start it. Like it was all game, like his best man",

And it was my first time in years being in like an East Coast, like Northeast woods. And I saw everyone like motherfucker. I washed my hands so many times, like totally in fear. Cause I knew how easily I got it. So, but anyway, long story short, I got picked on. I hated nature's classroom. And I mastered Jeopardy! on that. When you talk about summer camp, I think of, I used to, the, you know, village of Glen Ellyn through the park district had a summer, like a day camp summer camp thing, which I don't know, it's not, you're going somewhere to stay, but every morning you get dropped off and you would do",

And I liked it, I liked being called Spud. So Tim, you can call me Spud if you want to. Okay, can I call you Spud or? No, yes, you can call me Spud too. Everyone can call me Spud.

So the top of the door, the triangle, caught me on the side of my head and cut open my head. And I didn't notice it till hours later, cause it knocked my glasses off. Were the glasses real, Colin? No, they were from a box of cereal and I wore them every day. Knocked the glasses off my head, and I noticed later that I had this blood on my head. You would be such a different person if you had an older brother. Yeah? Somebody would have reined me in.

This was of course the summer of Back to the Future 2. Right? So there was many cool sunglasses that came with Cheerios. Now, little Greg Miller did not like Cheerios, doesn't like cereal to begin with, you know that. So I was at an impasse on how to get these cool glasses they had. I wanted the Back to the Future glasses. Luckily, Poppy, big old Jamie Kennedy's dad, he ate Cheerios. So one day I went over there and he gave me his glasses and they were the Dwyane Wade knock-offs. And I was like, thanks.
