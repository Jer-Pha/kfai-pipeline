            "text": "\"Hey everybody, it's me Greg, and guess what, Twitch Prime is a thing. What's Twitch Prime? It's Amazon Prime mixed up with Twitch basically. If you have Amazon Prime, you have Twitch Prime. If you don't have Amazon Prime, what the hell are we talking about? How great it is forever, but what Twitch Prime does right, it gives you the benefits of Amazon - two-day shipping and all that other jazz, the discounts, the games, and then gives you on Twitch game goods, ad-free viewing, and a free subscription to give to a Twitch person of your choice. And that's what we're here to talk about. If you look over here in the best friends everybody with a smiley face and the little white crown, they are a Twitch Prime member. We are not on the air right now, and they are giving us their subscriptions. Thank you all so much; you're blowing our minds as we watch this happen. Now if you are not a Twitch viewer, maybe just like us on YouTube that's cool. Well, if you're not a Twitch viewer though, why not come over and give us that.\"",

You can link your accounts, and then you can just give us a subscription and never come back. And we would get the money from Amazon, and it would pay for this studio that was really expensive",
