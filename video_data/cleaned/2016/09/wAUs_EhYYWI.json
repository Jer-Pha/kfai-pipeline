Sure, if we had a lot of fun in that, I'm looking forward to playing that when we get back yeah it's it's a fun game all right Sombrero says hey guys Wendy can I get a minority report on that name Kevin? Yeah god damn racist Kevin if I put the hat down you know it's okay if I put the ceramic top in the middle you know what I do all right you guys are definitely gonna make fun of me his name absolutely not, Sombrero - his name is Somber Owl.

Do you guys have any insider knowledge as to why these price discrepancies occur? Oh Deus only or do Sony simply hate us? My love Nick, we have freedom and so our freedom all it allows is to use a solid point next question: Do you have any real answers? No, so there, there I have answers for why games are cheaper in some places - I should say in some places in Brazil, for instance, games are way marked up. Hardware hardware is like outrageously expensive there because of significant taxes on imports there. So, like, there's things like that that happened. I think they were saying wasn't remember what wasn't the PS world.",

I think they were saying wasn't remember what wasn't the PS world literally like $2000 or something like that - fake name, erm, like psych ward. So like it's something to do with like over there and I could be wrong, I'm sure we have Brazilians who could correct me. I don't completely get that's something like they have an import tax on electronic goods in a certain way and it just marks the price up so I know that like in that specific market that's the reason or that's one of the reasons, also in Australia and in places like the UK and stuff. My theory on this - and this is a long-held theory whether sure or not - is that the United States is a huge market, so volume makes you more money on the back end and when you're in Australia where you have a fraction of the people playing games that you have to sell them for more.",

And when you're in Australia, where you have a fraction of the people playing games that you have in the United States, you have to sell them for more. I really do think that it might be as simple as that in some places. There could be some taxation issues, there could be some funding of different boards that rate the games that you have to pay for, and all those kinds of things. But I bet you that, and a lot of these smaller countries - I said you K is not really a small country, but Australia for instance doesn't have a huge population - I bet you something has to do with the fact that in the United States it's like why they released the PS4 here first; they sold a million units in 24 hours. That wouldn't happen anywhere else. Yeah, so when you're selling at volume, you can afford to sell the game for $60 USD, that might cost $80 USD somewhere else because the money needs to be recouped somehow.

Nothing. Nothing needs checkpoints. Check Brogan's so it's interesting anything about it that way. Yes, absolutely. I like this show LeLouch Lamperouge shout out sound. It's a Code Geass. They're considering Colin's admiration of Inafune and love of the Mega Man series. What is his opinion of the Battle Network series, which was my favorite?

I really like Battle Network; they were really great games. It's just that they - and actually, really all of them are fine - it's just that like they came out too quickly and then Star Force, which is the same thing, and it's like these aren't really Mega Man games, and that's always why I've always questioned the admiration of Legends as well because like what is it? What is it about this game that people really love that makes it Mega Man?

It's not the furthest Mega Man has ever gone out of the side of the classic series, where it's Mega Man is X and the unfortunate thing is classic and X are dead. We had never even got a bridge game that put them together, which would have been awesome. And would have been obviously they do maybe for you it's 25th anniversary Command Generations - no, sorry I was I was I was I looked real quick I'm like is that it Wily Castle? Um so uh I feel like the future of Mega Man is uncertain. So first of all my number nine, no one likes my number and I came sucks and it's a it's a disaster. I think in a few days legacy is definitely injured over it. And depending on how Recore goes - and I saw a Record behind closed doors at E3 - and I think it looks just very generic but I don't you know, I don't know if it's gonna be any good or not.

But Capcom definitely has plans for Mega Man and I still really do believe that they're gonna do a big triple-A Mega Man game and and I think that that would be cool but I also want Mega Man 11, I also want Mega Man X9. It's a similar argument I'm making about Tactics or these other games, or the Castlevania Metroidvania style games where I'm like why don't you just release these a lot and then stop when when it feels like it's time and then bring them back as opposed to like Battle Network she's dead right like Star Force is just dead.

Thanks Congrats on the new studio and keep up the great work. No, they should play a version of it and be very clear on which version they played. You know when we were at IGN and we did multiple platform reviews? I mean it was always the thing of I'd play through it usually on the PlayStation SKU for trophies or whatever the reasoning was, or that's what I got because those are my dev builds or vice-versa. And then I remember when you had to play the review would go up and then they're like \"the retail version\" would come in and I'd pop in the Xbox version or whatever version I hadn't played, and I'd play it for 20 minutes, 15 minutes to make sure that it seemed like it had the same issues in those same things, and then we'd transfer the review.",
