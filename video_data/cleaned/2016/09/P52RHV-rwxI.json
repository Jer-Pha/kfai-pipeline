I come back and there is a bag of dog shit on my car, and I'm just like that's weird - it's a little bag of shit, so I just take it off, bling it off, and that's it. Two days later, it happens again: there's another bag of shit on my car, and I'm just like what the hell is this so weird? Then I leave to go to Texas; we're there for a couple of days, and I get a text from a dude saying there are three bags of dog shit on your car right now. And I'm like, well, literally okay. Have you made sure that Kevin's not doing this to you? No - see, that's my thing: I haven't had time to talk to Kevin, and he was pissed off when I told him he couldn't come to Austin with us, and this is a perfect way for him. Also, when we first met, a bag of dog shit fell out of his pocket. Here's how we'll know if you set up the camera and you catch the person - but he's wearing the Scream costume; it's Kevin, you know? Yeah, car.",
