And obviously in a linear game like that, that's easy to do in premise but designing an interesting feedback loop where you almost want to die just to see what happens, and that that is one of the mechanics in the game is just figuring out what happens if you pull this switch just so you know. Um, and one of the cool things that with Erin specifically is because she doesn't play games and she's learning is that like she's learning it's fun watching someone learn what I would call gaming logic in this game. I'm like well there's just pull the box or like pull the switch and like figure out what happens, like things we take for granted.

But then even October with Halloween being great - we've covered before there's all these different games coming on October that's gaming and like big releases go hand in hand with school. I think starting back up and so that's where I'm coming from in terms of what games you associate with going back to school because like I said for me it's it's NCAA football, it was that one month to it.

I remember one year it was uh Soulcalibur 2 - that was the big one that everyone was super stoked about in 2003 or 2004. It was always there. It might have been something I think it was two, but two or three - that was such a huge deal because Soulcaliber one was so amazing, but Soulcalibur 2, with the different versions: Hayabusa on PS2, which no one cared about; Spawn on Xbox, which was random and awesome; or Link in the GameCube version, which obviously was superior.

Rocket Robot on Wheels? No, I'm thinking maybe it was SmackDown! 2, maybe it was just Bring It!, but wherever they introduced creative pay-per-view and all that stuff when they really went crazy with Creative... I remember having these loose-leaf sheets where I would do like booking this entire thing, this entire **** run of how I wanted this to go. And then I'd go home and create those pay-per-views and then create those matches and have them play out the way I wanted them to play out, proliferate these feuds between Owen and Hart and whoever... it's like crazy kids are weird man!
