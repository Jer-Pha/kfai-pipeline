The polls were so wrong, sometimes off by 10 points in certain states, just out of whack polling. Where I was like, \"I knew Donald Trump had this very silent support\" - we talked about the cone of silence and Shai Tory supporters and all that kind of stuff. And I knew that they were out there; I just didn't think they were out there in this great number. Um, what was the other name you used? Another name about how the uh the shyness of a person - it was a a black guy. I thought that Bradley effect. Bradley effect - thank you, that's from the Los Angeles mayoral race in 1982.

Uh, Michigan hasn't been decided but he will win Michigan, so he'll end up with 306 electoral votes, which is uh pretty close to being a landslide. Um, it was six. So right now it's 61.3 million popular vote for Clinton, 60.5 million for Trump; Trump lost the popular vote; he's probably going to lose the popular vote by more like one and a half million when everything's uh tallied because a lot of outstanding votes are in California and Washington where a 2-to-1 ratio are being voted so he's getting he's getting buried there. So for swing states, Clinton won New Hampshire, Virginia, Colorado, and Nevada; for swing state Trump won Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Iowa; um, and then the big thing here is that Trump won three states no one even had in play, so he won uh Pennsylvania which was the most likely of the three that he would win but",

Exactly, Florida's heavily polarized; it's got a native Republican uh population with snowbirds that come from the north, making it a swing state. Ohio is typically a Union state that would lean uh liberal with some and some college towns, some industrial cities with a huge Rural and Suburban Republican vote. So these states typically go... The big swing states are always Ohio, Florida, Iowa - isn't Iowa a swing state this time because Obama won it twice? Um, but you know... The big thing here is that Trump had this very specific path to win, and he just nailed it in a way that no one ever thought he had to win the Rust Belt. And so he did.

Education, this is also interesting: high school or less, 51% for Trump; some college, 52% for Trump; college graduate, 45% for Trump; postgraduate, 37% for Trump. Um, and then I'm just using Trump as an example because he won obviously do the math; he's also the more polarizing of the two candidates that makes sense. Income under $50,000, 41% for Trump; $50,000 or more, 49% for Trump.

Republicans were 33% of the electorate; 7% of them voted for Clinton and 90% of them voted for Trump. And then independents - Trump won independents by six points, 48 to 42, and that's what won the election. Um, and then these are other interesting ones too: that I just found. Union household - you would expect unions to vote for Democrats. If you're in a union, uh, you voted for Dem Clinton 51% and 43% for Trump. And then if you aren't... 46% for Clinton, 49% for Trump. And then if you served in the military, veterans: 34% for Clinton, 61% for Trump. Um, and then first-time voters voted for Clinton 56% to 40% for Trump. So those are the exit polls for what happened.

Is that casting the Metal Gear movie slightly more important than this? I think just in my opinion because Steve Harvey needs to work.
