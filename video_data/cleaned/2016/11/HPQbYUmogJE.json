I run around doing all the side stuff I'm just collecting non-stop because it's just one of those things that I'm doing so well at getting the research points and unlocking the new things on my trees why even bother playing the game until I've done all of that until I've gotten every paint job until I've gotten every piece of clothing until I've gotten every research point.

So the Alola forms, uh, it's you're still getting Vulpix, but now it's Ice-type instead of Fire or whatever, so it's like those types of things are nice. But in addition to that, the game even from early on switches up what you'd expect. So everybody that's played Pok\u00e9mon knows that you get the Pidgeys and Rattatas early on in this game. You can catch Ghost-types, you can catch Water-types, Fire-types in the second area of the game, and I'm like holy **** they're really opening this up to be a different type of experience um while still giving us the the old a nice mix of new and old so that it never felt overwhelming with new like clones but it also didn't feel like great it's just the same thing over and over that we're",

This game made the decision to have the trainers on screen at all times, so before we would just see the two Pok\u00e9mon; now it's always the trainers with their Pok\u00e9mon, so there are always four characters even in a one-on-one match, which I guess aesthetically looks cool but like man it causes a lot of slowdown. Yeah, and the good news is the chugging doesn't affect the gameplay uh because your screen text and stuff still comes up at the same rate; it's just kind of annoying to see like camera moves and stuff and like them just like moving super slow doing moves, it just looks kind of shitty yeah um and also being on the 3DS like the the art style of the game is really good and Pok\u00e9mon's always had a real nice",

Nintendo didn't think it through like that. That was the thing where again a cool function and feature, but then they just really poorly managed it, especially because you can't throw a Pokeball at one if there's two out there, so you need to kill one to be able to get the other. And it gets frustrating when you're trying to catch one; they keep calling backup, so you have to keep killing this stuff.
