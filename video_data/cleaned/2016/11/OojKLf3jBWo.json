Where there's so much other stuff going on last year, where had it been earlier in the year I think it would have been more popular because you don't really see people talking about Rainbow Six Siege now but the people that are into it seem to be super into it yeah but Rainbow Six Siege has always had that hardcore fan base and I think one of the things as you know to go alongside with the fact that it released you know during the time of Call of Duty and everything like that was the fact that it just had a lot of issues, you know what I mean even off the bat like when it was",

And then there's the whole another uh season which they'll probably have another season pass for that too. And it's great, they're doing free DLC right, that was one of the things they were talking about today. And their thing is how Ubisoft, like going forward, doesn't want to charge for DLC that's crucial to the game or critical to the game in terms of changing the experience. And that's, have it more cosmetic and stuff. And there's just a bunch of like little things like they have a ranking system that's kind of like League of Legends where you're like you play 10 matches right and then you place and then",

They even they even do little things like uh you know like last season I placed in Platinum so that means that I got a little Platinum keychain that goes on my gun, like it's something that's tangible right, that everyone can see, like oh this guy is a platinum player as opposed to like this guy's a gold or anything like that. So it's just little things they've done well. Yeah, is there a punk ass **** medal? Yeah, bronze, oh that would be me. Yeah, true, it's like the embarrassment one. Turn oh my God.

And they do the same thing with Siege, but it creates an interesting dynamic as opposed to like Halo where you just go in and you just play as opposed to like, oh snap, okay, like do we want to change things up and take Rook? Where now we all get armor and it takes more bullets to penetrate. You know what I mean? Or as opposed to like, if we don't take this character then we're taking like, we get this other cool character that can see gadgets through walls but we risk not being able to take down their reinforced walls. And so it adds this cool little dynamic in terms of like play styles. So I love Overwatch. Overwatch speaks to me because it's that, but as dumbed down as possible if you want you can, you know, get super into it and play hardcore but like it's just fun to play as the different characters.",

How do you compare the two? I mean, Overwatch is Blizzard-like; they just do things right, you know what I mean? Like, they came out with Overwatch; they're memorable characters. It's got like this mobile-type feel to it, right? Or even in like I like how they kind of implemented this mobile feel and even baby-stepped you into it where just like oh, you pick all your characters, like oh not enough defense characters or not enough healers or not enough attack, and I think Overwatch does a great job of being like fun to play with iconic characters but like hard to master.

Um, and I like, I just like what games are doing right now where they're adding more content, right, and having events, having events, and having uh more things to like with Overwatch specifically, how now there's a 1v1 you know what I mean? I'm not paying for that, but now there's a new map with a 1v1. There's events; I remember it's one of those things where I can come back to the games now, you know, there's a reason for me to come back as opposed to usually I would just play something like Overwatch, I'm like all right cool, but now now, oh there was a Halloween event with a Halloween-themed game mode and they really went like full on through with it.",

Oh, there was a Halloween event with a Halloween-themed game mode, and they really went full on through with it. Now, there's like costumes and stuff like that. This is the antithesis, right, of what happened with the original Titanfall, where you played the original Titanfall to death, and then it just wasn't growing right; there weren't making a thing out of things, no content exactly. So, you leave, and you don't come back to it, or if you do, you're like, \"Oh, where did all this come from?\" That's great, but they didn't make a thing of it. And that's what we keep talking about, you know, so often on these shows, is games becoming platforms. And Overwatch, right, is a platform; Siege is a platform; Division is a platform. These are shooters that are putting more and more things in there trying to get you motivated to stick around and be like Destiny has done so well, right?

What you need, yeah it's very interesting to see how like different games in terms of level of success with that right? So you got Overwatch and Siege, you've done well as you know as time has progressed, and then you get like games like Destiny who just keep hanging on there, and then you get games like The Division which I feel were just too ambitious. 'Cause I saw The Division, I was like, \"Oh my God, Destiny was my jam,\" here's another like loot shooter they've got this great content plan lined up like with multiple expansions and DLCs, and every time they dropped a new content it was just glitched that game was glitched out of its mind and it just worked against it right even to the point where like they",

I mean, they're still going to have the Infinite Warfare multiplayer tournaments, and I feel like that's because there's a new generation out there that loves the new age Call of Duty multiplayer - that just isn't me. So, like, instantly, I'm like, \"Con multiplayer, what the hell?\" Like, I played the beta, and I was like, \"Uh-uh, no, not my jam.\" But, personally, I would say Infinite Warfare's multiplayer - they did a good job with it, better than I thought they would. Battlefield is great, Titanfall is great, but yeah, that one. Even though it's still going to sell well and they're going to have tournaments and tons of kids are going to play it, it's going to be huge player base still. Do you think all three single players are worth playing? Yes, yeah. Um, I-I enjoy Battlefield the most. I think they did a great job of like telling a story with like different characters - I cared about all of them. The pigeons, the war pigeons - you actually be a war pigeon - it was very",

It's you know what to expect, it's an action movie Michael B. like campaign thing about it for me is that you know I started Battlefield and then I started Call of Duty and I beaten Titanfall single-player play uh and so Battlefield because it's segmented I feel like I got the thrust of it I'm not like anxious to get back to it but when I beat when I Platinum Watch Dogs, the plan is to go back and finish off Infinite Warfare's campaign cuz it's like it's still just in the middle of that story like I you know I took the bookmark and put it in there and shut it and I'm like I actually want to get back cuz I did like those characters and I did think they were doing interesting stuff and I want to see what happens next, yeah um I think they all did a",
