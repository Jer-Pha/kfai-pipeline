So let's get right into it. What y'all been playing? Big Call of Duty, uh, few games. I played all the way through Battlefield 1 on hard. Um, got all the codes, got all the Battle... or Field Manual, so I got all the collectibles. I have every single player trophy. Uh, jumped online for a few hours started playing it there. I like it. I want to get back to it. Um, maybe press here on route to platinum. Yeah, it's good. It's you like the multiplayer. Yeah, it happens once every couple years.

Um some of Call of Duty zombie stuff is great but uh yeah I I so I I really spent quite a lot of time with Battlefield 1 and I really think it's one of the great games of the year. I we've talked about it already, we talked about more cursory way with giving our impressions of it from early on but I think the vignettes are fantastic, I think uh the storytelling is awesome, it's diverse, it gives you different perspectives from um different Allied perspectives including D-Day and and uh etc an American perspective uh which is cool uh kind of through a British lens so I think the storytelling is really good.

Um, and I guess you know multiple storylines, you start, you commit into it to actually start into it and play through. Colin likes the story so much, and that's what I like the most about video games in general. I'm in the tank one right now, the one we talked about with the pigeons and stuff. But even like, I guess an hour into that, an hour and a half maybe or whatever the hell, I miss totally the same thing of like, man this is actually awesome. I mean the game obviously throws you into this thing, this is actually really, really cool. I am invested in what's happening in these guys' world and where it's going to go and what's going to happen. Yeah, it's very cool.

That one's uh, yeah, he's telling the story of his friend um Matt Matros, I think, um, yeah. So I I jumped in, I I think you know there's a lot of gameplay diversity there. I I really think um mechanically, I mean we'll see. I played a little bit of Titanfall, which I'm sure we'll talk about because Greg's beaten it, and then Call of Duty, uh, I have it, it's just I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet, that kind of Trifecta along with Doom, I think pretty good year for Shooters, um, which is awesome because it's one of my favorite genres, uh, and then I played Virginia, um, and I beat it twice, I platinumed it, um, I really like it a lot, uh, I think that it's a little vague, I think intentionally.",

I beat it a couple weeks ago; I enjoy it, but it's an interesting one. I think worth pointing out not a spoiler of course, but no dialogue in it, yeah, yeah, no dialogue, a different time, yeah, nobody talked to them, it was, yeah, no, no talk, no dialogue, written or verbal. So I think that that's pretty neat. So a lot of it is, uh, you're just getting it through facial expressions and all that kind of stuff. We I played with and we both really enjoyed it.

I wish it was just a shooter where you're getting a mech and then get out of the mech and keep shooting. So I'm not wild about that. But um, I'm also very early and uncomfortable with the controls so you know that might change in time. So that's what I've been messing around with the last week. So that brings us to topic one of the day Greg. I played so many things this week though. You oh okay, I played Sho. I want to talk about Shu. I want to talk about WWE 2K17. Look dope.

So um and I know that you - I don't want to necessarily compare the two but they are I mean this is what I was telling Greg is like this is a great year for shooters actually, and with and there are others, but Doom, Battlefield, Call of Duty, and Titanfall, and unfortunately out of those four games, Titanfall is clearly going to lose. So I just feel bad for Respawn because I don't necessarily know or think that they have anything less than a good game, but I haven't played it 100%, I haven't played enough of it there, but it's just it's going to lose and I really do think it has significant ramifications for Titanfall as a franchise again. I don't care what Blake Jorgensen and these guys at EA are saying about the game like the game's not going to sell - isn't selling well; games typically sell a lot, the vast majority of the copies.",

This creates a massive problem, and this is what I was talking about with clogging the pipeline especially for third parties with these iterative consoles now they have to make two versions, they have to patch their games for PS4; they're going to have to do this with Xbox One now they're going to have to have a downgraded version if they want to put their game on Switch - just like it's a disaster. I mean, for third parties, I kind of feel bad for them, and I suspect Switch is not going to get strong third-party support. Um, ultimately we'll have to wait and see how those games sell.

Game Boy actually was another device where you kind of have to separate those things.

A redditor, triple H280 reported that he was riding a Montreal subway and took a picture of a guy's laptop, and if you zoom in a bit, you can make out the name Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which is also a name we've heard floated for the next game in Lara Croft's iconic series. A source told me today that this is indeed the name; it certainly fits with the last two games, Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider. Square Enix has not yet responded to a request for comment.
