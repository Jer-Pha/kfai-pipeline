Trump lost the popular vote; he's probably going to lose the popular vote by more like one and a half million when everything's uh tallied because a lot of outstanding votes are in California and Washington where two to one are being voted so he's getting he's getting buried there. So, for swing states Clinton won New Hampshire, Virginia, Colorado, and Nevada. For swing states Trump won Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Iowa. Um, and then the big thing here is that Trump won three states no one even had in play. So, he won uh Pennsylvania, which was the most likely of the three that he would win. But Pennsylvania is what's called fool's gold in politics; the Republicans never win it, and they always go there saying they can win it and then",

Uh so a swing state is a, you can pretty much look at the map and predict the way 40 states will vote every time. Um so Texas is always going to go, Utah is always going to go to the Republicans; Texas will go to the Republicans, California is not even in play ever it goes to the Democrats; New York which was Donald Trump's home state still not in play for him.

If you guys want to look at the house, which is Republican plus 60 or plus 50, that's what the election looks like now from now on. The other thing that people are talking about is giving it up by um instead of win or take all, diving It Out by um by popular vote; I'm like the Republicans win there too. So you have to be very careful and not just in a popular vote literally in the Democratic way but in terms of congressional districts: if California had 55 votes and they all went to Clinton under that under that scenario, Clinton would have gotten 35 votes and Trump would have gotten 20.

No one saw it coming - Tory Brexit, conservative won against all the polls in Austria next month a far-right coalition is going to win, then in France Marine Le Pen is going to run and she's probably going to win, and then they're going to vote to leave the EU and then they're going to leave the EU, and then the EU's gone. All of a sudden, like that, complete political turmoil in Western Europe. And then in Germany there's going to be another far-right party coming up. The thing is, we are dealing with right-wing reactionary politics versus left-wing politics versus standard generational left-wing politics for a long time, and it's not going to start, it's not going to stop here.

Um, so here's what I want to say about this particular topic. Sure, the idea of varsity blues or fan films - the fan films, my apologies, is it goes back to what we've talked about with like people making fan games and stuff like that. I'm like, why like like the like the idea that um like Pok\u00e9mon Uranium, I think is that game or whatever, I'm like you know you're going to get your ass shut down the second you release this and why are you even putting your energy into this? This isn't even your universe; you don't own this; you didn't make this. And my whole thing is like I want to write a Mega Man game really badly, I'm dead serious about it.

But I don't want to rewrite Mega Man 2; I want to use the themes from Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3 to make a unique new game. It goes back to like why is Blade Runner getting a remake? Why do they go back and do all these things where it was technically a sequel, though? Yes, okay, okay, so that's just to clarify; that's fair. So why is any other remake ever getting made? That happens 17,000 times, and I for some reason selected Blade Runner except I'm concerned about this because this goes back to what I think: there's a void of new ideas in the arts, right?

Just enjoy it while it lasts, yeah. It's a beautiful argument, my one thing, and I have no attachment to Star Wars, uh, couldn't this just be like the Marvel film universe where the Marvel universe doesn't run to the ground?

It's crazy man that and they did that though, and that that's the magic of Pixar, that's what I think is what they did really well with that film. Is that because I was older when I saw that movie, and it it was nostalgic for me? It did make me think of those days when I was younger. It did make me think of playing with toys and the attachment you have to that that world that you create in your own brain with these toys. So they did that, they did a good job at that. But again, yeah, I mean Inside Out was probably it was complex and it probably was a little hard for a lot of people to grasp. So I think maybe just missed the mark a little bit. But but what I was saying though about Pixar is they are the golden standard, and despite a couple I don't even want to say misses but just not surefire hits, uh, I think that they they do everything right, but it's all the other people, the animated movies there's the Iron Man",
