Field Manual, so I got all the collectibles. I have every single player trophy. Uh, jumped online for a few hours started playing it there. I like it. I want to get back to it.

It's for those that don't know what is Virginia - Virginia is a kind of a walking simulator, and again, I don't use that term properly. It's just a great game; it's a great term. Um, you're an FBI agent, a black female FBI agent in 1992. Um, and it's about uh a time in your life, specifically with your partner who... and I don't want to get too into spoilers because the game is only 90 minutes long or so. Um, there's not much on PS4; I think it's on Xbox One and PC. Um, so on PlayStation 4 you have to beat it twice and get some collectibles and stuff. I just did it all in one afternoon basically. Uh, I really like it a lot again. I think the ending is a little vague; it gets into kind of some weird territory um that I think holds it back from obviously being uh on the level of something like Gone Home you have to think about",

You have to think a lot about this one when you beat Virginia; you got to sit there and uh reflect on everything that happened, try to draw some conclusions, find some interesting things online. I beat it a couple weeks ago; I enjoy it, but it's an interesting one. I think worth pointing out - not a spoiler of course - but no dialogue in it. Yeah, yeah, no dialogue, which is different from the time when nobody talked to them, it was... yeah, no talk, no dialogue, written or verbal. So I think that that's pretty neat. So a lot of it is uh you're just getting it through facial expressions and all that kind of stuff. We I played with and we both really enjoyed it.

But it's the funny thing of what you're saying right is that the people who are talking about how great it is and how much they're having fun with it - again, I'm not saying these are bad; we're going to get into what I'm talking about here - uh, they are the minority on the internet as well though. Right? This game is not selling; it doesn't matter that it's a critical darling; doesn't matter that all these people are saying they like it a lot; it's not moving units, which is sad.

And what's most heartbreaking for me is I jumped into single-player uh and immediately was underwhelmed. This is one of those you know downsides of not getting to it until after the weekend I was in Montreal right so reviews had posted kids online were already playing it people we were Alex O'Neal friends like that, and so so many of them - and I'm talking about like you know Austin Walker too and Jeff Gerstmann who are saying like holy **** this Titanfall single-player is on another level, this is so amazing, this is doing so much cool stuff.
