Uh, Ratchet took a lot of my time; we already discussed Ratchet pretty extensively, so we don't talk about that anymore. Um, so the game I'm playing right now is Severed, although I can't talk about it the game's embargoed actually for a long time. I don't think that we're even allowed to talk about it extensively until after PAX East. Um, that's where I'm at with Star Fox, but uh, there's a lot of those games right now. Yeah, but I will say, knowing DrinkBox and knowing the PR agency that's repping them, I think I'm comfortable saying that Severed uh is um a game worth being excited about. I mean, that's that's my my interpretation of it. The way I keep interpreting it for people is, I played an hour of it last night, uh, and the hour confirmed everything I've said at the PAX East preview as I played it where I'm like this is fun; I think I'd like to play this.",

Like Skyward Sword, uh yes it's kind of like Skyward Sword, um and and uh but never mind. So uh there's these Circle icons that represent all the enemies and you can click you can like press them to turn around and fight the next enemy and these yellow gauges fill up to show like when they're going to attack so you have to like face the enemy and either interrupt their attack or block their attack by slashing them in the opposite direction that they're slashing at you, so uh parrying exactly.

Even though if not, if it's going to be the experience I had where it was like \"all right, let's do the same thing\" and you pop your special on this and I'll pop no, not that. So that's been part of it. Uh, so then yeah, Enter the Gungeon. I jumped into Enter the Gungeon - I'd been waiting a long time since Nick and I saw that at that event for Gamescom here in San Francisco. Totally delivered on what I wanted.

And then getting it home and playing it, I was like oh it's it's a you know is Dungeon Crawler, it's all different things, it's like Rogue Legacy but then dying and starting again, Rogue Legacy when you die, you kept your gold and you got to go buy something to make the next round easier or whatever that's not happening here with the exception of some credits I'm getting up here that I haven't found what to spend them on.

It's awesome, fun, it's clever, it's cute, it's funny, it's got everything going for it. The characters feel different - like that I was playing forever as the uh pilot because he looks like Nathan Drake. And then I was like, \"Well now I'll try the Marine who looks like uh you know a Halo Spartan or whatever.\" He had a different gun set, he was different.

Um, there's a couple mini games in it; they're not really fun, they're distractions at best, and uh I feel like if they were a little bit more fleshed out, and if they weren't so hard to access \u2013 you need to get a certain amount of points to be able to even play the mini games.

You're in this weird little toy car and you're doing stuff. I'm like, \"Why? What is happening?\" And it happened so fast that you then moved on to the final section, and the final section is a boss fight with uh this Iron Giant thing, and you turn into adult Noctis, and you'll you do Carbuncle helping you out. Carbuncle's the **** homie, Nam mind Portillo, natur thank you. See that's the thing is like no matter how bad this demo is or how weird it is, I'm still going to do it at some point 'cause I want to make sure I have Carbuncle on my game. Yeah, you got to mean again it's so fast you can beat this thing if you if you ran through it, I think you'd probably get it done like 15 minutes okay um so then we get to the the final part which is the boss fight and that's the thing that I wish that I could be like \"that part was awesome\" so it's all all fine",
