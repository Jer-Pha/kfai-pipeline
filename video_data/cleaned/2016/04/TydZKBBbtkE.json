And immediately started freelancing for GameSpot because, like, oh, you have a debug kit. No freelancer has a debug kit. It's like a hyper-rare thing. Like, three freelancers I've known ever had a debug kit, right? Which is crazy because why would Microsoft ever send me a debug kit to this kid in the middle of nowhere? We'll send one of these $15,000 machines. So it was like my entire career. The running theme throughout everything is that people literally just handed me dreams every time.

I get it, but then there's the family level, where you're like, \"That is a family member; we can't do that.\" I remember at one point, God damn, and I forget how many times we were there, but when we're addressing the IGN mission statement or whatever, you know what I mean, the values, and we wanted to put \"family\" on there. And like, the business guy in the room had to be like, \"I understand; that's a love sentiment; it's not a family.\" You know what I mean? And it can't be otherwise; this doesn't work. What do you do when something bad happens and you have a fight or...yeah, it's hard because you're at a place like that where it is very lame because everyone is always like, \"You know we're a family.\" It's just...is yeah, like I talk to everybody I know who has ever left IGN still on a regular basis.",
