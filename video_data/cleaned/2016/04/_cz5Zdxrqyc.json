Uh, it's going great, man. Uh, we had a panel today. How did it go? Uh, well, we announced not to plug too much and too quickly uh that our new game LawBreakers is coming to Steam exclusively, which is kind of a no-brainer when you really think about it like what would we put it on Origin, no offense um and then uh we also announced we're not going to do free-to-play with the game, really. So that's a huge change; we were initially thinking free to play, and the more we dug in, the more we realized we weren't thinking about how to make the best game possible. We're always just worried about how we're going to monetize this, how we're going to monetize...

So I'm looking for there's got to be a gray area between you know free-to-play sleaziness and $60 disc-based games. There's maybe an impulse initial gate in there and maybe some interesting microtransactions inside the game, but but we're kind of rethinking and upending that whole model because I announced the studio and first off people are like \"Nexon, really Nexon?\" And I'm like, well, you know, yeah, they make Cart Rider, but you know they have some money and they want to make western games, and that's what I do. Um, I make shooty-shooty western games, and umong... well, not like WoW West West anyway, and so the um... and then the other thing was free-to-play, like you lost me at free-to-play, and I'm like, well, League is free, come on man, um, and so we want to have",

So, it takes place in the near future where there's been a massive earthquake, and uh, people have managed to rebuild, however, gravity just gets funky - there are areas with no gravity, areas with increased gravity, areas with inverted gravity as well as humanity learning how to harness these powers.

I just felt something which so this just blew my mind for a second. So you're actually you physically are walking yeah so since it's the Vive it's room-scale VR so you're actually you know they have the cord taped down it's it's only about you know 10 to 15 ft you know but they but you walk you know you feel the cord beneath you you look down you see completely below you you actually I shouldn't have looked down that was my problem and you walk to the other side and you turn around you walk back and like",

Can you imagine what they're going to do with the big, biggest thing about VR? That's you know, there's a lot of things I could go all day about VR, but one of the things that'll screw VR first is bad and cheap VR. Like people like we got one too, and then you know if it's not VR is not perfect, it'll just make you sick. And like there's always going to be a small percentage of people that it might hit you know, like there's people that get sick in cars all the time and things like that.

Um and the other thing is like dumb VR experiences, that's why Oculus has a store that's curated so it's not just some vomit-inducing roller coaster or it's not just some big dumb cheap scare. Because you know something when something you're next to a big robot who looks at you in VR, you know you feel like it's right next to you. You know I did one of these uh multiplayer games with my wife, I can't remember what was called on the Vive where like you know we're back to back and this and we're shooting robots together and she's in the other room but I turn around I see her avatar like moving around behind me shooting robots",
