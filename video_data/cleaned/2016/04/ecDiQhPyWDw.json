The final topic of the day, as always, brought to you by the Kinda Funny forums. Go to KindaFunny.com to leave your topic, and we'll get to it just like we're doing right now with Antonio Lana. Antonio says \"hola\" from Bolivia. H from Bolivia means hi from Bolivia. Kevin, oh Kevin, can you is can you translate? Is that correct? No. If you could exchange a first-party IP or first-party studio of equal value that would benefit more between PlayStation and Xbox, who would you pick? So was a trade yeah it's something for something, and it can be an IP or developer but they have to be equal, correct. I'm reading the question right. Well, hot off the heels of Quantum Break, I would want Remedy to make a PlayStation game, and I feel like a good trade is not first-party though. Is that what he said? Yeah, I thought it was exclusives my apologies. Yeah, it's first-party. Oh, um can I cheat well then how",

How about that Colin? Remedy because they're in this deal with Microsoft all the time when they're making these exclusive games and then I'll... They can have Quantum Break. We'll flip-flop that dream. What did I say, Quantum Breaker? Got him **** up, you know exactly what I mean, the same way you said quick dream. I still want Detroit before it's announced and done, cuz I already got Quantum Break on this side. Give me Detroit on the other side then we get a flip-flop to go over there and do it.

Do you think it's possible for a game to be too hard by design to its detriment? I think hard and frustrating aspects of games are different. I agree, and I think the game that comes to mind is how games just aren't that hard anymore, and if you can just really beat any game you want as long as you put your mind to it, which isn't really the case when we were younger. Yeah, um, the one game that I remember, and I reviewed it, if I remember correctly, based on me playing it the same two stages or so over and over again not being able to get past it was Under Siege on PS3.

The reason I chose this question is because we've answered this many times before, but it was the Keir story that's really good one; yeah, I was talking about my PS2 story being a big deal where I knew I was going to do that, so I took a job at Walmart over the summer and would go over to Best Buy on my breaks because I hated the job at Walmart and would buy DVDs and then just sit and look at them in the car and then put them on my shelf and then be like \"I can't wait to watch these special features,\" then waiting in line nine hours at GameStop to buy my PlayStation 2 or whatever, and taking it home and all this different stuff but one",
