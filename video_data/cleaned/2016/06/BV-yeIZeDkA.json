Coming into this one, is that in your mind, you know, you have to do something bigger and better than last time? Uh, not so much scoring the yeah I want to win the award but uh, I think we, you realize that when you come out and you first announce that everybody's going to love it because it's great. And there is such a thing as kind of the second the second album - you need to prove that it's actually a game, sure.

Perfect well speaking of challenges you know looking at the gameplay demo one of the most challenging things that seems to me from a development perspective and then you know just sort of getting the player balance right is Aloy's skill set as a player. It seems you know you compare to the stuff you could do in Killzone, he chose different classes there was a lot on the table but this is one character but she can do so much depending on her different tools and they combine in different ways in different environments against different creatures. So that core skill set seems to be one of the real big pillars it must have been you know in terms of your design initiative well it's it's a role playing game, so part of a role.",

Well, it's a role-playing game, so part of a role-playing game is that you progress your character and what we showed I forget which exact level she was in in the capture that we showed at the press conference - I think she's a level 12 - that means that she uh has unlocked certain skills that you can choose and uh one example is the concentration mode, where she's able to slow down the game so she's got a lot more precision in her attack uh the other one that I see in there is a silent strike, so she takes out one of those Watchers by just gliding underneath it and stabbing it and it's a one-strike kill. So these are skills that you don't necessarily begin with uh but up to your uh flavor - whatever you like first - these are the ones that you can pick and build out your character well, so speaking of these skills",
