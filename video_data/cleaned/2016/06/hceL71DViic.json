Which in terms of Executives I know exactly what you mean, dude, that show was like watching movie trailers before a movie, there's no one talking, it's just thing after thing after thing but you haven't seen any of those trailers before and they're all really awesome and there's a live orchestra behind the entire thing. Yeah, really, oh my God, the fact that they had that through the entire show so impressive. Yeah, no raise in the bar, I it was literally they came out of the gate pedal to the metal and didn't stop and there was no catch your breath moment, Call of Duty wasn't even there like in in the the real way of like we're going to make a big opening or",

Most of the third-party stuff was contingent on VR; we don't know if a lot of these are PSVR exclusives or whatever. But like, with these, I mean, I'm counting uh, let's see, just two, three third-party games maybe there, the entire game, like the entire that would most definitely be on multiple platforms. Resident Evil 7 is going to be on multiple platforms; Star Wars is going to be on multiple platforms, etc. So um, thought that it was super strong. What I was really quite interested in was that all the first-party games really appealed to me in different ways uh god of war and like start let's just go chronologically like we do in the Gamescast we'll start",

Doesn't take away from them being fun just means that I never looked forward to a God of War game, and with this it seems like the design mantra is totally different. It looks like it's going to be like Tomb Raider - um yeah cuz you walked into this new area discovered new area discovered. It seems like it's not going to be an open world but it's going to be is connected to each other kind of like Dark Souls - um so it seems like it's going be like that.

So uh, I think uh, I think God of War looks fantastic, um, super excited to play it, interested in my assumption is that they, I mean at the end they confirmed just in development for PS4, I assume that God of War must be a 2017 game, I don't think in any way it's this year, I don't think anyone expected that it was going to be this year, but I think it's a safe bet for that and I think it looks really cool and old Kratos coming out of the shadows in the beginning even though I don't resonate with that character at all and I know you feel the same we've been talking about this for years and years, you and I, um, cool to see him as a different Kratos and that they do kind of play with the like you said play with the temper tantrums.",

Yeah, know I'm still excited about it; I'm a little hesitant about how the story is being told because how much can you do with that, you know, with this many different variations happening? Like, well, I mean did you ever play Heavy Rain? No, I mean that was Heavy Rain's bread and butter. And the fact that that game had what was it 23 or 22 different endings that you had to play through to get the platinum, and how different it played out and the choices that did...
