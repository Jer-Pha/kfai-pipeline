How are you? I'm getting some text messages. You're blowing up. You're important. Do you think it's about E3? A lot of E3 stuff happening. No, I don't want to. I can't. Please. Over here. Hello.

For days on end now, people have been tweeting about Overwatch. People were foaming at the mouth to get this game. People are crazy about Overwatch. I don't get it. Why are people so crazy about Overwatch? Well, people really like Team Fortress 2, right? Yeah, from what I hear, they had hats? Yeah, no, they had skins. And it's pretty much the same. Yeah. No, it is a class-based shooter like a Team Fortress 2, but with more classes to choose from. I really like its art style, and they've found a way to make the classes very friendly to play.

It's a nightmare. It's a nightmare. Not what I want to play. Not at all. So every one of these shooters that comes up and it's like, it's MOBA-inspired or has MOBA tendencies.

It's escorting a payload somewhere. It's defending points. It's capturing points. But all the different character class stuff from a Team Fortress 2. So you've got healer roles and assaults and tanks and the sort of stuff you expect to see from a class-based game. Other than it being the next coming of Team Fortress 2, for you, what makes it stand out? Because it's one of those, I feel like we've had so many multiplayer shooters. There's been so many good things. There's Borderlands. There's this, da da da da. And all of a sudden, with, yeah, it was. So, alright, here is Battleborn. Here is this one. Here is Paragon.

What are we going to do? And then, you know, Paragon was born. And then Hobby Grade Battleborn started its wheels turning or whatever. And so now all these bets are starting to hit the marketplace. I think some of them pay off better than others. Overwatch is a little weird because, you know, apparently that started from Blizzard's MMO ambitions of making this thing. So some of these assets just came out of some different game. And then they were like, that's not going to work out. That's a terrible idea. Why don't we pivot into making a Team Fortress 2 style game with these characters? And they did. They actually, like, they nail it. It's quite good for what it is. I hate Team Fortress 2.

I don't like class-based shooters generally either, except for custom class type stuff, like a Call of Duty or something like that, where I can go like, okay, I want to, this is the gun I want. But when it's like, okay, you need to play your class like a MOBA, like some of these other games, I just, I don't play games with other people I know often enough to get the most out of those types of games. So generally speaking, I just, those games never work out for me. Overwatch is well made enough that I'm having more fun with it than I ever expected to have.

And I started to, like, I've been playing healers, which I don't play a lot of, but they've made healer classes actually fun to play. And someone needs to do it because no one else was doing it. No, it's never been fun to be the healer. Sitting in the back. But when I'm healing these people and then they're not getting the job done, they're not hitting their shots, they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing, at some point if you start to care, you start to get mad.

I played a little bit as soon as the servers came up, played a little bit last night and then put another hour in this morning. I have not played a ton of it, but First Depression is really impressive. And like I said, I think they've made a better one of these kind of games. A better Team Fortress 2 in my view from the limited time I've played it. See, it's the talk of, that's what scares me about it, and that was for The Division when I hit 30 was the big thing for me of like, ooh, I'm done with this.

And then maybe half an hour later I'll be like, I'm going to play a little bit more. I'll launch it again and play one or two more. But it's not the sort of game where I'm sitting down and like, okay, for a six hour stretch, this is what I'm doing. Sure. And you're not alone. I think I saw Mike Drucker last night tweeting about it. I'm watching this and then I jumped over and played this and now it's, or it was somebody else actually. And then I'm stopping to watch, stop watching a Bachelorette or whatever to go play Overwatch and somebody else is like, all right, that's enough Overwatch. I'm going to go play Fallout now. Exactly.

But also that makes it impossible for me to go like, hey everybody, let's get together at eight o'clock and play this game. Because I'm just never going to play for 15 minutes. I'm never going to be that person. Sure. So that's, this is not the game for me, but I, that said, I am actually enjoying it quite a bit. What do you see from what, and what do you hear in terms of longevity? Right. Cause I was blown away. Cause I'm, when the betas were going, I saw people tweet about it and they were really into it and it was from people I expected it like, you know, Boogie was up there talking about how great it was.

But yeah. Do you think it'll burn out? Do you? Cause I think if you look at Blizzard's track record for like adding content to its games and all that sort of stuff, if you, if you assume that they will take a similar approach with something like Overwatch, I think they'll probably hit a good cadence with it.

I'm probably good. I also had a weird bug where my screen was in shadow mode, great. Where everything was really dark and I was running around. But my question I guess is since you already have the heroes, you already have, is it just that I'm unlocking skins? Am I unlocking weapons? Yeah. So every, every time, every time your bar fills up, you gain XP to gain levels. Every time that bar fills up, you get a loot box, which has five items in it. They could be sprays for, you know, spraying your logo on walls, additional voice lines and taunts. And then yeah, there are skins for each character that also unlock. Gotcha. And then",

Best value, you spend $50 for, they're $40 for 50 boxes or whatever it is. But then at that point, like you're basically destroying the whole progression, which if you just like playing the game and want a certain skin and this is maybe the best way to get it, I guess I could see someone going down that road. But that seems crazy. I mean that to me, that's what it speaks to with what you're saying, right? And the fact of like, it's okay, I'll play for 30 minutes, two matches, whatever it is. But there it is. It's, it's, I can get in, I get out and there is no, oh, I'm so close to the next level, which would unlock for sure this gun, which would give me this path tree or duh, duh, duh, duh. Yeah. Yeah.

For, for a few years there where it was like, okay, I'm going to actually sit down and play this for six hours straight. Sure. But yeah, I think that, that, you know, Overwatch will have a pretty good sized audience for some time to come. It seems like a pretty safe bet really. And not just because it's Blizzard. I know they, they seem to, you know, like Blizzard has its fans, they have their own convention, you know? Yeah. So people go nuts for Blizzard stuff no matter what.

I think that game's got real problems. It was the same thing for me with Overwatch where it was coming up. We had talked about it. Who knows what's going to happen. It's probably going to be a disaster, but like you looked at video for it and I was like, Oh, it kind of looks like Borderlands. That's neat enough. And then it came out and I was like, well, there's, I'm not this guy. There's a million other games I want to play right now. Right. Yeah.

Yeah. That was the thing about, I mean, I called, I mean, it wasn't even a call cause it was so obvious that Balborn was going to crash and burn. I mean, that was so fucking obvious. It seemed like a year ago or so. Like the first time I saw it, it was just like, okay, this demo seems kind of bad, but maybe there's more to it than this.

Like, you know, I was like, this seems like a game with MOBA tendencies. This is obviously gonna eat Battleborn's lunch. And then there's Paragon on the other side. But then there's like Destiny and The Division, which are not MOBAs, but are like persistent shooters where people are playing these games. And what it came down to was like, it's not so much the genre, but like how much time can a person possibly invest in these games, these games that require you to play them for months or maybe even years at a time if you really want to get the most out of them.

Overwatch is a huge Blizzard game. And then you have these games from Ubisoft and Activision that are obviously going to get a huge push. So like these, I kind of, I feel bad for them too, but this was a bet made by a studio that has way too much money probably and knew that they can have a failure. And I don't know if they're stupid enough to really like, you know, they're clearly not stupid at all actually over there. They knew that this game probably was going to fly. I'm surprised that 2K really wanted to get involved with them on this because like post Evolve especially like 2K, you know, this is obviously a different developer, all that other stuff, but like 2K seems to want to make",

We have our open-world games. Now we have our MOBAs on console. Now we have all these persistent shooters and all these kinds of things. Like what is the next, you know, is it a massive, almost I feel like maybe the next thing that people wanted to get involved with 18 months ago at the embryonic state is something like a very ambitious The Witcher 3 style open-world game or whatever.

There's definitely very transparent reasons that they're doing it. I just hope that developers and publishers have taken a look at some of the great examples that seem to have bucked the publisher or monetary trends going on. And MachineGames is a great example to me with Wolfenstein, which I think is a fucking immaculate game, especially the DLC with the exception of, of course we talked many times about the intro, which is awful of Wolfenstein. The beginning of Wolfenstein. But that game is awesome. And they were like, fuck all of this. We don't need multiplayer like any other Wolfenstein games that were very tacked on.

Even going backwards into that market, I think they worked on Shovel Knight for the Japanese market, which is a really crazy concept to me for some reason.

Second topic, ladies and gentlemen of the Kinda Funny Games cast, the ever changing face of E3. Yeah, right. As of recording this today, they announced and I read it on Giant Bomb. Oh, I've heard of that place. This Austin Walker fella writing up news and stuff over there. They announced that on top of this already being a weird E3 with no EA, no Activision, no Disney, that they're now doing this public one right next door at LA Live. There's this public thing where kids can go. They already sold out of tickets on the first two days or whatever. It was free. It was free. You just had to go check it out. Oh",

So like it was noon to five and five to 10 p.m. when you went to go sign up for it. By the time I looked at it, like an hour after they announced it, almost all of them were already all booked up. Now what's interesting in Austin Wintory's article on Giant Bomb, he puts out that, that said, the list of attending companies is a bit of a weird mix that definitely skews toward general games culture more than development. So far on board for this public E3 thing is Alienware, Facebook Oculus, Frito-Lay, HTC Vive, Loot Crate, I know them, Monster, Twitch, Ubisoft, Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment.

Well, I mean, EA pulled out and wanted to do its own thing and they're letting the public into that. They're even doing a simultaneous event in London at the same time. That's what simultaneous means. Yes. And so, you know, E3 kind of had to look at that and go like, okay, well, if they want more public interaction, then maybe we can give them that. Do you think it's too late? This year, yeah. Yeah. But I mean, for going forward, do you think? Oh, I think that there's room for that.

Yeah, they'll probably have new stuff for that, right? Oh, so it's Jeff. Oh God, I hope so. I bet Disney would have been done really well at something like that.

And then you, you know, you bring in a company like Frito-Lay to sponsor the whole thing or whatever, you get some bands, you do some stuff, uh, and there you have it. Uh, I don't know how it would go. I'm interested to see it, but like, you know, E3 is not as big of a deal anymore for a lot of reasons. For some of the same reasons that the like traditional video game press is not as relevant as it used to be because everyone is cutting those types of things out of the loop. You know, you have a company like EA just speaking directly to its audience or speaking to them through like influencers or something. Um, and as a result, like the idea of like, hey, let's, let's",

And I think that, I mean, when we were at IGN, I was saying for a long time that because of the public nature of Gamescom, that Gamescom is going to be, and I think already has become more important than E3 in many ways because of how big it is. So it gets the headlines of, well, we have our little press conferences and all these things, but the people that are really like the smaller YouTubers or bloggers and obviously the websites go and then people, hundreds of thousands of people getting their hands on these games then it kind of starts to chatter, especially with VR, which I think is really important.

And you saw Sony having to do that as well. Like Sony was just like, we're not going to Gamescom. And everyone's like, what the hell are you talking about? But they don't have, there's just not enough content to justify being in every one of these shows. And so I think that, you know, E3 is, sorry, I love that event.

And we were talking about like, we don't really need to go like, but we want to kind of see some of these games. So we're going to, but with the press conferences being the most important thing, we could just stream them. Exactly. And so we all, we were all in games media a long time ago and we know that like, the gatekeepers were, it was important to have the gatekeepers that were like, I'm at the demo and here's what I'm seeing.

I think Sony is actually kind of delegitimizing its Tokyo base and actually putting everything now in the West because they realize we already saw the Canay and the Colin with PS4 launching in the United States first.

So for Sony to sit there and be like, oh, like Activision's blog was the first step. And that's catching up to what we knew print or print digital media was. Yeah. I mean, four years ago, EA was interviewing themselves and putting it up on YouTube and no one was watching. Yeah.

So you throw in an ad market that is steadily crumbling and it gets harder and harder to make your revenue targets as these big monolithic video game websites and all this other stuff. At some point, you're like, you know what, we're going to double down on the things that people actually want to read. And so, you know, that's like two of EA's games. But they've got eight more.

So do you feel I mean, because I feel like it's such hyperbole, but it seems like is E3 dying because my first E3 was the dead E3. All right. Go to Santa Monica and run around. I'm like, this sucks.

That to me just says that they don't want to lose their booth space, because if you give up your booth space on the floor, someone else gets it. And if you want to come back in the following year, you're at the back of the line. Nintendo would probably be a little closer to the front of the line. But you get my point.

It's just so funny that they keep suffering. I love Housemarque, but the amazing game. Like how does that stuff not roll back into like their core like code base or whatever? Absolutely bizarre. Someone's definitely the producer not paying attention probably. But yeah, I'll be interested to see how this all pans out. And to Jeff Gerstmann's point earlier, I'll be interested to see if and",

Because I think PSX, the first PSX I found to be a little, it was fun but it was a little sad almost where I was like, it was too big, the space was too big for the amount of people there. So it was like, it looked a little empty and I'm like, this is not, Vegas isn't the right look for the show, this space isn't the right look for the show. And then PSX at Moscone was totally different. And I think that they kind of nailed the tempo, they nailed the breadth of what they want to do. And they had some good announcements there as well. I mean, it wasn't like E3 scale every single time, but like it was a good, it was the right level of announcements that you would want to have for this PlayStation.",

And we're all like, rah! And everyone's just excited to see Geo. Look at that jersey, it's beautiful. What hockey jersey is worth a day? Oh! Yeah, like that stuff's great. It's great that they've been able to do that sort of stuff. But you know, I think yeah, the E3 press conferences are the things that matter.

I think it's rubber banding again in the way of like, the amount of press people that go to these are like, can you turn off the fucking music? Can I just hear, can you talk to me? Can I not scream over the game? What's happening? Like, you know, that's the E3 I want. Just like how we always talk about though, that's the industry party we want, right? Right.

And you know, CES was really great because there were a ton of great Super Nintendo games there, but also car stereos. But also video games were in a tent and it was in Vegas in January. They just had this big, huge, heated tent full of SNES games. This is like 92. And the games just got treated with zero respect.

And it's like, it's really great. There is a future of video games feel to it, but it's all very expensive and most of these games are bad. So it's very early days and eventually people will start to figure out what are the right ways to, you know, sort of like, you know, like iOS games were terrible when they first came out.

And then you have a lot of people that are just like, hey, here's a quick way to make some money while people are content starved and bought this $800 headset. And so some of that stuff feels a little bit like a scam. But then you play something like Budget Cuts, which is a demo that's on Steam. It's for the Vive.

It's just like, hey, here's kind of a dumb game. I'm going to keep hitting this ball and or I'm going to keep shooting this stuff.

I'm certainly a believer in VR. I think it's awesome. I've not played nearly as many games as you have, but I do think it's a new way to play. I think it's akin to shoulder buttons.

I don't think I don't think there's going to be fundamental things that are ever going to change in that way. We just might not we might be doing it in different ways.

No. I'm a guy on a chair sliding down a hill. Right. Doing it with like, what the fuck is going on? And I think that that's actually my one concern about PlayStation VR is the PlayStation Move controller stuff not being as accurate as the HTC Vive motion controllers. With HTC Vive motion controller, you can kind of move it as fast as your arms can move. With the PlayStation Move controller, with the camera tracking on the PlayStation Move controller, I was doing something recently, which I can't actually say what it was, but I was trying to move as fast as I possibly could.

The other thing I think you'll see, and this might be the thing that actually changes more traditional games a little bit more than this, is when augmented reality, when AR or mixed reality, MR, as I saw someone calling it recently, starts to kind of happen. There's a company, I think they're in Florida, Magic Leap, they're called, and they've got something like a billion dollars of investment. Very few people have tried their tech, but everyone I've talked to that has says it's the thing you want these VR headsets to be, that it's the real deal. And there's a video on YouTube of it, of like the DreamWorks or Weta or somebody, yeah, Weta did the graphics on it or something, and it's like, you're putting on glasses, you're looking at an office, and then you're picking up a real",

I think that that's the whole reason why they're making new console. And I think that until we can get onboard processing on these things, which is far away and at affordable price point, that it's going to be shitty to be tethered to this machine that you know is just not strong enough to run the games that it can really run. On the other side, you have Oculus, which I think is going to suffer from not only its high price point, but being first in a lot of ways, even though they aren't the first VR headset.

And then three years later, everyone's playing games on their phones and Nokia's over here and I was like, I told you. So I think that there could be something with that where it's like, it's too expensive. It's too soon. It's it's they have a lot of funding from Facebook, so they're good. And I think Vive has a visibility problem. So I think and I don't mean an optics problem from the machine. I think they have a also like, you know, HTC is tethered to the phone market in a lot of ways and they're not doing the numbers there that Samsung is.

People that even I think supported it very early aren't getting theirs. But you can go in a store and buy one. So Best Buy must have done some deal with Best Buy a while ago that they had to honor, even though their shipment thing went totally sideways. Right. There's no other reason why they do it. But it sounds like the Best Buy is, you know, in some cases selling five of them. So it wasn't even going to put a huge dent in that preorder market and was probably something they were just beholden to in a way they couldn't get out of. That's my guess.

They have since locked that up from the sounds of it not on purpose. It's just some other changes they made to avoid hacks and stuff. But still in early days, that's the sort of stuff that doesn't look great. But more importantly, I think they maybe underestimated the early adopter market. And something I did as well, I thought like, well, make the Oculus story make sense. They put it out, use a gamepad. Then when more enough people have the headsets, they go, hey, check this out. Here are some some controllers. But it turns out anyone crazy enough to spend 600 is crazy enough to spend 800 and get a Vive and get the controllers right off the bat. And that is",

You have, you know, a lot of cases where like, you know, Job Simulator is a wonderful minigame kind of thing. It's a great illustrative thing of the power of the touch controllers and or the the Vive wants and stuff like that. But also they at launch, they want like 40 bucks for it. And they've cut price since then. So, you know, people are figuring out. But you know, when it comes to PlayStation, it'll be the same deal. Yeah. Yeah.

But I also think that Curio, and this is something we talked about with Shuhei at GDC, which I think goes to the point you were making earlier about curation, which is having a great volume of launch games makes sense for hardware that's proven. So we had it with the Sony ecosystem. Vita had a lot of launch games. PS4 actually had a lot of launch games. And we know what these we know what these can do or whatever.

And if you come out and people feel burned spending one hundred dollars on some of these fucking trash games that I know are going to be on the PlayStation Network because they're on the PlayStation Network every goddamn week on PS4 and Vita.

If you like it's almost what I've been saying about PSN for years where I'm like, you could probably get rid of 75 percent of these games completely. I don't think anyone would give a flying fuck. How much how much could this game with this broken drop description like we were talking about on PS I Love You. That's translated from Japanese that no one even read. Right. How many hundreds of copies is that going to sell? I mean, can you really just get rid of it? And then when someone searches for a game of a similar name, they actually find what they're looking for and it's good. Is there any quality control? I do think that there's an object.

And you must pay attention to that stuff because people have a bad experience with VR. Their first or second time, they're never going to go back to it and you are going to lose them forever. Yeah, I suspect that like the requirements I actually like talking to developers, I think the requirements for getting a VR game onto Sony's stuff, there are more performance requirements than you would have for, say, a traditional game.

I hope so, because that's that's my one major fear is that seeing PSN slowly turn into the App Store has really been distressing because it used to be it's still a good place where you can play great games. But I look at PSN all the time and we pay very close attention to that ecosystem. And I'm like, what the hell is these games that limp out out there nowhere, their face featured on the store like what the hell? Xbox One is not that different. You know, their storefront is definitely, you know, but but at the same time, like I feel like those games don't get featured very often. And that's the difference.

No, this week, what's going on? And you see like eight games that you've never heard of that you look at and go, OK, this like a dollar forty nine thing is trash.

But I think, you know, like the dark end of that is the early days of most Xbox Live Arcade and the Xbox 360, where they kept a very tight grip on that and had like one game a week. And sometimes that game was not great. And you're like, OK, well, I guess this week's game sucks. And they eventually loosened it up a little bit. They don't know we had two games, three games, but it was still like, you would talk to developers and they'd be like, it's I don't I don't want to work with them because like if, A, if we can't get through this process, it's not even worth like we were wasting money",

And then on top of that, because of the way the store is built, I think this is a problem with definitely with Steam. I think PSN, same deal. If they don't get featured, the game will not exist. It's the thing you hear about app stores on phones all the time is if you don't get featured, your game is dead. Like that's starting to happen. That's definitely happening on Steam. And it's definitely happening to a certain extent on consoles as well. There's a year of people saying like, well, we didn't get the promotional slot that this platform holder said we were going to because someone else came in and bought up all the space or whatever happened.

So I just had an indie developer hit me up that I need to respond to because we're so busy. But an email just like, how do I get anyone to pay attention to my game? Like I'm trying I've taken all this feedback. I'm hitting up, you know, podcasts with codes and trying to get people to play. And it's just not happening. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's that's the the reality of it now is that, you know, every week we've started saying no to more games like we used to you know, we used to record more quick looks than we do now.

He's got on his luck. But we just get nonstop Kickstarter pitches like, hey, here's the game. We're launching the Kickstarter tomorrow. Here's our trailer. We're not going to run ads for you.

And so, yeah, like I said, I talked to a few different people that some people were looking to start kind of new arms of their existing publications. And then I ended up meeting with Dave Snider, who was running Comic Vine at the time. And that whole company was ex CNET people. So it was all people that I'd worked with before Dave had worked on MP3.com when he was with GameSpot. And he had worked on GameSpot and all this other stuff. And, you know, Sean Connery is like a great team of amazing engineers and product people, just like smart people top to bottom that had were running this comic book Wiki site.

And they were like, it was weird. Like, I was on an IGN podcast, actually, that was one of the which was fun to do. Let me tell you, coming from GameSpot. I don't know if you had the same experience. It wasn't quite. You didn't rock it out of IGN. I didn't leave during the dark times. I mean, I talk about it back then.

Matt Casamassina and I had the same pair of Oakleys. So of course I wanted to fight him. And no, but you know, yeah, like, like people were trying to run it like that. And at the time, at the time GameSpot was pretty far ahead of IGN, if I remember right. We got to a point where like we were doing all right. Getting kind of bored with the competition aspect of it. Because that's what it was to us. Like from day one, like same thing with IGN. And, and it was dumb. Of course, you know, it was very dumb to, and that's, you know, that's the thing I learned really about, you know, getting fired and getting out of there was that thing of just like, here's this",

And then they were like, and I was like, okay, I'm never going to do that again. Unless it's my name on the door. Unless it's, so starting something new felt really good. And starting with these people who understood what I was coming out of, why I was coming out of it. And, and what we wanted to do was very powerful. So we were, we were able to really rapidly iterate on what Comic Vine had done with a wiki and, and built that aspect of the site. And then, you know, figuring out the editorial component, the content component of it was a little harder because it was just like me and Ryan and, you know, we didn't even have a video guy, but we bought a, we bought a Mac Pro and all this other stuff going like, well, we got it.

Those are stories I can only tell because they came back around and bought us. You know, like that's the sort of stuff that would be like the shadowy. Yeah. So yeah, it was great starting it up and you know, we kind of lucked into a lot of stuff that then kind of became standard. You know, at GameSpot, you know, the idea of putting up a video that was like longer than five minutes was crazy because you were just like, you know, you would almost have to contact the publisher and be like, Hey, we want to put up some gameplay footage of your game.

And then it became clear that editing these videos was actually more time consuming than recording them. So Brad actually happened on the idea of just like, well, why don't we just go for like an hour or you know, or actually it was more like 15 minutes at the time. Like the Quick Look was actually quick eventually at one point and then it just became us just putting up unedited hours of video game footage. And we kind of happened into that at the same time that like, you know, YouTube had started to happen and you know, kind of the let's play community was kind of spinning up and it's just starting to become a thing and becoming more of a thing.

No, it's, it was everything, you know, we were doing deliberately, we were doing everything that we didn't get to do at GameSpot for one reason or another, you know, whether it was, you know, the, just, it didn't make business sense or like we were making the website we wanted to use, you know, which was the early days",

And this is all wrapped up in it I think. Next question is from Tom, the Killah Snap, the Killah Snap. Okay. Who says this question is aimed equally at Jeff and the Kinda Funny Boys and he's actually right this time. I recently became a Giant Bomb Premium member after listening to you, listening on and off to the bomb cast for a good long time. Since then I've seen and watched a bunch of awesome content and really enjoying it. This got me thinking about the way Kinda Funny pays the bills with Patreon.

You're dying to stay away from it. You had me up until the end. For sure, for sure. When we launched out with ours, you know what I mean, like the story is old at this point, but like we had a meeting in the summer before we left and it was alright cool. The week before we all go home and figure out how much money you need to make to leave IGN. Like what do we need? We came back with those numbers and sat down and we're like, well, nope, that ain't gonna happen. Like maybe we'll look at this another year and a half, two years from now.

It was just like, I don't know about coming back to this daily. I like Sudoku. Yeah. It's not, you know, like it's not quite that, but you know, but I occasionally like a puzzle here and there, but nothing too deep. Um, but there was something about being able to like, it was a game much like Portal one where when you solved problems, you felt like the smartest person in the world. Sure. And there were definitely cases where it was also the time type of game where when I got stuck, I could go to sleep, wake up refreshed and solve the thing I was stuck on. Okay.

Like this, this is making me crazy. Like I just can't do this. Um, but, uh, I was able to make fairly steady progress and, and really got sucked into it. Uh, and you know, a couple other people were playing it. So we kind of like, where are you? Where are you? Okay. Did you find out this thing? And they'd be like, no, I don't even know what you're talking about. Okay. Well don't spoil anything. You know, it was, it was exciting to have a, a puzzle game that could inspire that level of conversation. Um, so yeah, it's, and it's beautiful and it's, it's really, uh, just a, a nice quiet, long puzzle game that was very relaxing, but also very mentally taxing at times too.

And I didn't do the final challenge. There's a, there's a final thing for the final trophy that, uh, uh, I wasn't able to do immediately and then had to go review something else and all of that information went away. So I can't ever go back to that game and probably finish that off without replaying the entire game. I was having such a great time with Catherine back in the day and then we took a week off and came back and I was like, I don't remember how to do any of this anymore.

Speaking of games you don't enjoy, this is the final one. Comes from Sam NW who says, Jeff, you're one of the few people in games media who really disliked Red Dead Redemption. I think it's great personally, but there's certainly room for improvement. So what could Rockstar do differently with the sequel to win you over? What if they had like cars?

Yeah, I definitely was like forcing myself to come back to it and I was like, okay, I don't really like the open world aspects of this. Like, what, like finding horses and plants or whatever. Sure. You know, like the different stuff around the edges of the game didn't grab me either. So at some point I was like, you know, I don't, I don't need to play this game because other people on staff are playing it and I don't want to.
