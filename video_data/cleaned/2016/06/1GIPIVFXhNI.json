We are, and over there, this is your one Tim Gettys, let Tim host. How's everybody doing? I'm pretty excited. I'm good. Why are you excited? We're recording this - we're in a time machine for this. We record this before E3, but yesterday I finished my E3 wardrobe update. Oh, so I'm pretty excited about this. I got some new shirts from Nordstrom, and I debuted a whole bunch of new stuff. I did not get something from Vans; I got another pair of those Nintendo shoes - no, Nintendo shirt. Okay, it's obnoxious all over print purple and blue, Donkey Kong's involved. It's exciting. What I'm super excited about is that if you remember for Christmas, I got an adult sweatshirt, an adult hoodie. It was gray heather gray; you've seen...",

And then but immediately this tour right here, but I stitched it back up myself and everything was great. It's the one hoodie I have that doesn't have like a logo on it. I don't know why I don't have a Kinda Funny logo hoodie; I don't know why that doesn't exist yet. But I you know I don't have the Twitch one, I don't have an oversized Missoula one and I loved that one; it pulled together outfits nicely. I wore it to the South by Southwest Gaming Awards right? If I want to go out and I want to look good but not too good, I put on a college shirt, I put on a tie and I put the hoodie over it with my jeans and my cons and I look like there you go; I can go anywhere.

I got so excited because it came back from the laundry the other day, and I put it on. I was like, \"Yeah.\" And then I went out with our friend Caleb, and then I ran into Marty and golf Barb, and I got completely wasted, wasted, wasted drunk. So then on the way home, like I'm too drunk; I need to eat some pizza; I need to sober up. Went to the pizza place, got a slice. Was like, \"You know what else I'm feeling?\" I'm feeling give me some of the ranch dressing, damn! You were really feeling... oh, I was two pieces of cheese and that ranch stressing.

GIF became popular because it used LZW data compression, which is more efficient than the Run Length Encoding that formats such as PCX and MacPaint used, and fairly large images could therefore be downloaded in reasonably short time even with very slow modems. So what's interesting about this is that really nothing has changed about like - I think that it says here on Wikipedia that the last like the last update, the latest release of it is 89A released in 1989 - that the format like hasn't actually changed fundamentally at all since then. Since before the World Wide Web, it was invented; the World Wide Web didn't come out until the early 90s.

The White House and TV program Jeopardy also weighed into the debate in 2013. So, it's basically finished. I mean, the people that used it in the beginning all pronounced it GIF intentionally like \"jif\" but the dictionary accepts both some dictionaries accept two pronunciations while others put stress on the first syllable.

The problem with Will Hight's thinking is how we see acronyms: Are they their own words or do they stand for something? Is BBC a word, B, or is it BBC? You combine the letters into a word. How does JPEG for \"jpeg\" make sense as opposed to \"jaeg\"? If GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format, does the graphics portion of the phrase point towards a hard G in the acronym? It gets confusing. I know, but the clearest difference for me is that there are different things pronounced like GIF and not spelled GIF already.
