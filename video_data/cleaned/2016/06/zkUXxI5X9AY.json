They said from the ground up, I don't believe for a second that those games are being remade. I think a lot of people think that like they're gonna be given the Ratchet and Clank treatment no it's not... there's been there's been a lot of rumblings a lot of interviews going off here and they're like random little sources, he said from the ground up, that's a direct quote but it's not what they're doing is it.

How are they gonna do that? You're gonna do widescreen, this is what I'm interested in - it's like how they can I don't know, they're gonna be able to do it, yeah, it'll be interesting. So reason to all you do is run straight to the camera the whole goddamn game; that's not your right sometimes the cameras behind you. You guys, you know, you've made me, you convinced me that these aren't good games, no, but you guys are wrong, you guys are straight-up wrong about this.

Yeah, and I really, really fascinating stuff, and I didn't realize how well the original Crash game sold - all three games were top 10 best-selling PlayStation 1 games, all three of them sold more than Final Fantasy VII, mmm-hmm, over 10 million copies sold in the... yeah, Crash man, whose huge, they turned those games really quickly. And the other thing is they did a reboot now.

I think that the first time I played it, which was years ago now, I knew that it wasn't gonna be like this fantastic game. I remember the first time you played it, and you came back and said, \"It doesn't feel like Mega Man; it's different; it's more action-based.\" Yeah, it's not Mega Man, and then that's and that I think is a disappointing kind of thing. You know, a friend of ours from Deep Silver, who's you know they obviously published the game, tweeted out today that P was this point what some people's reviews which I understand, I mean but saying that like people are expecting are docking the game for not being Mega Man whatever and I'm like well no offense but the game was marketed and funded as a successor to Mega Man so we do expect the",

And in a fun way, can do better, and any creators can definitely do better. Back to my point that Deep Silver is filling the void that THQ left of like here all these mid-tier games that you have no real reason to care about but they're Homefront, I never know, yeah, like if I had... I mean I've only played I only played Mighty No. 9 and a few a couple stages and I thought it was fine, all that was fun and I was excited to see the whole game was excited to get back into these robot master type enemies and like to get the war and really learn about the world and stuff but if I had Deep Silver only got involved with the game late and if I was playing the game if I had access to the full build, I played again, I beg no way in hell are we publishing this so like I don't see what they were seeing or what they thought",

And it's weird because my number nine is super generous with checkpoints and lives and power-ups and things like the E-tank type of thing they have in there. It's just like the game wants you to beat it, and there's so much movement going on - I've got to move fast! God, the idea is moving fast, so there's just part of the game where... the Mighty No. 9 is the boss, and the other eight are the enemies that you've beaten already, which become your friends after reprogramming them.
