I'm a big fan of ice and I've always thought it's weird that Colin's not, and it kind of bothers me that thing whenever we go to a restaurant for lunch, Colin orders a Coke no ice, and then it comes, and inevitably the straw keeps coming out and going all limp on top, and he's got to shove it back in there. There's nothing to hold it there; the surface tension is trying to repel it, an' no anchor. Yeah, ice is totally unnecessary. Like I never... The reason I get a Coke with no ice is because have you ever really had a fountain drink at a restaurant that wasn't already cold? What's the point of the ice? It's literally like one in a hundred restaurants I go to, the Coke is room temperature because I got it with no ice. Usually, it's cold as if there was ice in it already. Mhm. So you're suffering from the principle of displacement and also water.",
