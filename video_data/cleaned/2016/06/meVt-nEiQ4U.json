Yep, you can combine the classes, so you can make a cyborg ninja or whatever they were talking about. But I like too that like when you change it, you get to see that backstory. Course, the E3 demo showed the back story of you know, you're the Speedster because uh your dad... your mom. But now when you change them out, you can see what made that that kind of hero, that kind of hero. Yeah, dude, so the demo kind of elaborated and was a little bit longer than the the press conference thing that we saw where um after the whole the the backstory thing there was like a battle scene before he finds out that his dad... up and uh I I thought it was cool. It's really it's really funny. I like I like that it's funny. I like that it's in the same, and this sounds stupid but I like that it's in the same universe like",
