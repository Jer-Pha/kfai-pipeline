It's weird that they've persisted. I don't know anybody who checks them still. This seems like a grandma thing we were talking about right? This seems like something that you check and be like, \"no, okay.\" I think... And here's case in point maybe we should one, we'll do another one of these where you mix them up and we'll see if it actually matters. I've always wanted to do that.
