There's nothing they could do against the hero's final strike - Sonic Dash. He was just too Speedy with the Intruder, soundly defeated. You thought you were safe until a third massive Intruder entered the fray. Bigger than the other two Intruders, I just flushed one little... **** now here's one more before you could react.
