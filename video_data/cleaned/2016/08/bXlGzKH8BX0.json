I am a competitive local guy, and I never get all the trophies in Madden.

That sounds really appealing; that's what I always wanted out of the Vita version \u2013 I wanted there to be a Vita version that communicated with the PS3 version, so my team comes with me and I go and I play, and then Vita just sucked because nobody cared, nobody wanted to do that.

So in terms of what would I do, I would make sure that it's a handheld system that is powerful enough that it's not a joke. Yeah, um, and it's weird because it puts it in the place of like, I can't believe that we're now talking about this as if it's a good idea, cuz it's like that's like the Vita too, but yeah, is that a good idea? No, it's not a good idea. Why is it a good idea for Nintendo? Cuz they're Nintendo - that's the whole thing.

I think that the Theater Mode is very important, but that's not a selling point. I think that that really is a sense or something for the people who have it. Yeah, is that because you know, you can just make your life a little bit better?
