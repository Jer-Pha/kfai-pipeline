Hey, this is the first time I've ever done a show with you. I know that's true. We did the Patreon exclusives, but those are different. You didn't have to do the intro roll in the beginning. You just got to do whatever. Now you're here. You gotta be locked in. You gotta be delivering the goods for everybody. You gotta be very professional. #profesh. Yep. That's definitely not trying to be Colin. That's what I'm going to do today. No, Colin doesn't host shows. He only hosts Colin & Greg Live. That's just a whiteboard and a lecture every day. The lecture. Oh my god. He's a teacher. He is a teacher. Colin's a teacher. Man, he was trained for it and he uses it. Oh man, that would have been I'm excited for this.

He comes in, he just rants and raves. And you're like, \"Is any of this going to be on the test? Do I really need to know about this third party Gary Johnson right now?\" Yeah, exactly. About the third party Gary Johnson. We're talking about American history, not American right now. What are you doing, ladies and gentlemen? Patches on him. This is Kinda Funny Gamescast.

So we're going to do two topics of of audience questions. We got some good ones. Okay, good. About time these kids brought something good. It's going to be fun. Let's start with Abzu. Abzu cuz my god. Yeah, that game looks like a game. It's taking us It's taking the world by storm. This Abzu. It's not hit the Pok\u00e9mon Go the world threshold, but okay. Our industry, it's taking Marty O'Donnell by storm. Oh, and Mitch Dyer and Kotaku and Chris Blazinski. Everyone's out there tweeting and talking and reviewing Abzu talking about it. I just played it.

I just played it. I just beat it. Yeah. Okay. That was something I did for two hours. So, let's give a little bit of background on Abz\u00fb. Absu not made by that game company despite the similarities. Giant Squid is the developer, and they're led by Matt Nava, who previously worked at that game company. This is their first game. The art director for Flower and Journey, right? Aka two of my favorite games of all time. Yeah. Leaving here to do this. Correct. Also, Austin Wintory, composer of Journey. Yep. Composer of this game. Look at you with your facts. And that took me two minutes of watching you play for me to be like, \"This is a game for me.\" Right. This looks awesome. And that's the whole thing about it is what I want to as we get into this. What do I think you should play",

It's It's another one of those games, of course, that's going to be our games are art. And here's this thing like my it's it's similar to my inside thing when we did the review of Inside where it's just like it's really abstract. You know what I mean? And like I get that and you want me to talk about it and think about it, but I kind of don't like that. You know what I mean? And so to go back flow and Flower never hit the mark for me. I played both those games, finished both of them, right? Yeah, probably. And even though the it's the journey, not the destination with those kind of games. IMO Flower I like Flowers.

Flower didn't click with me. Yeah. So, but Journey did click with me. I love Journey. Journey I thought was okay, cool. I get what's happening here. And with Abzu, I never really got it and I just beat it like literally 20 minutes ago, 30 minutes ago. And so I need to go read about it. I want to go do the first thing I did though was jump into Jose Otero's IGN review and he was with me there. He gave it eight three I think.

Is this an a game for art's sake? You know what I mean? Is it that kind of thing? And not anything wrong with that. But it and it also just does feel like in a lot of ways underwater journey of like you're going it's like what's happening? Okay, here are some of the cave paintings or like I'm trying to figure out what exactly piece it together how it's going.

It's this game that's meditative. It's this kind of thing. That's what I've been applying to my expectations for No Man's Sky. That No Man's Sky is going to be the game that I sit there and play and chill out for 30 minutes a night and be done with and go to bed. Uh, jumping into this one today, I wasn't necessarily in the mood, but I wanted to be able to talk about it. I wanted to see what everybody's talking about. I get why people love it. It is beautiful. Oh my god, is it a beautiful game every and like that's the one that's for me the best part of the game is like at any point I felt like I could put the controller down and look back or go into the meditate meditating because that's like one",

It's always beautiful like the colors whether they're using a very very dark palette, you know, and you're underwater it's it's dank and it's gross or you're this bright beautiful it's tropic. It's a coral reef. Awesome stuff there. Awesome. Awesome color. Really beautiful game. Animated incredibly well. Swimming very fluid. It's funny.

And I was like back to inverted. I'm flying like a plane. Whatever. Yeah. That that's that's always hard that inverted thing. We talked about this before. I think with Ratchet & Clank, I was having the issue with the the remake of it where the I play I used to play inverted, now I play normal, but then when uh it comes to the camera of the left and right movements in like a third person thing, sometimes it just doesn't click right where it's like I want one to be horizontal and or one to be uh inverted and the horizontal to be uh non-inverted and or stuff like whatever it is, the opposites and it it just tricks you up.

So, it's like I was trying to swim, you know, over there, right? So, I'm pulling up and I pulled up too far and did like the I was like upside down and trying to come back. Yeah. A minor gripe. I don't want to make this out to be a thing. It just for me, I had a little bit of trouble wrapping my head around it, but I eventually got it. And it's also not a game where it's like you need to be precise. You're going to get punished. None of that. Back to the relaxing thing of just like you're underwater and it's chill.

It doesn't and it's PS3. It doesn't matter. PS10 can be out and that's going to look amazing because of the art direction. And I think that this is another one of those moments where the art direction of uh Matt Nava, he gets it, you know, he gets how to design something to evoke emotion. Uh just just from the look of it, look just watching you play. It's like I get the feelings of of Journey and of Flower, but like this also it had its own own thing to it. I remember back on the the Gamecube, the one of the the really special things the Gamecube had um in terms of graphics because it wasn't the most powerful. The Xbox by far was the most powerful that generation. PS2 tend tended to look better than GameCube did. Gamecube was a little bit more round around the edges and stuff.

It was so like, oh my god, like this is and they kind of overcompensated in a lot of ways with that. Um but I feel like that those things are what push the limits of stuff. And now these days, water, video games have nailed it. Like we've seen it time and time again, but seeing you play this, I'm like, man, this is making me think about water in video games in a way that I haven't in a long time. And it made me stop and think, all right, so from flow to flower to journey, flow is like on a really small scale, right? Like a microscopic adventure, bacteria in your eye. Yeah. Flower is this like beautiful grassy fields",

And like kind of caves, but mainly desert. Then the big question is where do they go from there? And I think underwater is the uh obvious answer. And I think the other obvious answer is space. So that's why I think No Man's Sky makes sense getting brought up in this conversation. But what's also funny is because I've thought about this. I'm like, what do I want from um that game studio next? That game company and that game company. And not to say that that these are them, but obviously when you're it's the spirit. Not Hello Games, but obviously I mean like that's what my thing is to quickly aside is like playing this game I and I'm enjoying this game",

It's not none of that's bad. None of that's like oh how unoriginal. It's just like I'm not as blown away by it cuz I feel like I I know this game already when I just sat down to play it. Yeah. And that's and it's such a weird thing cuz people never be happy. It's like you can never be wowed again like that because that was so so amazing and such a unique thing.

And I I always thought it was going to be Underwater or Space. And it's funny seeing you play this because taking No Man's Sky out of it. Um it you could replace that with space because of the way you control it. Like seeing the way that you were navigating and stuff like it made me think of Star Fox, you know, or stuff like that where it's like you're you're you're it's a linear game. You're driving through. It's a kind of like an on-rails um space sim, but you're underwater, right?

But that but also just like um the epic moments felt like you were building towards them. And you know, games get a lot of credit these days for being like, \"Oh, it's an interactive movie.\" Mhm. Um, and then we talk about the Uncharteds of the world or or the Call of Duty single player campaigns or stuff like that when when we talk about that.

You can go you can go to the floor fish the ground floor hidden spots and you know unleash new fish by letting them go. You have to but then there's some light puzzle solving of like all right, I got to get this chain to move and that chain to move and that'll open the door. It's all super simple.

Like I was, you know, not trying to get every fish unlocked and I and I don't even know if I would be motivated to go back for the, you know, silver trophy.

And it's weird because it's not that far off from the Super Mario Maker uh levels that people make that are just you hit right once and then it or just hold right and run and it like plays through the whole level for you. Um or or you know people always talk about certain games like um I mean even even Journey is like oh you just hold if you just hold straight you'll win and it's like that is an oversimplification of",

That was the same thing in Flower. Now, Flower was different because you had to move the controller. Six Axis. We love it so much. But there's a um it you start to feel connected to it in a way that you don't with other games because the the way that you're controlling it becomes like a roller coaster in a lot of ways.

It's like Sonic the Hedgehog. That's probably a really good way to bring this up in terms of everyone's like, \"Oh, you can just you just go fast and hold right and jump.\" It's like, no, that's not how that works. Maybe the first couple levels, Sonic is actually really more about the um the physics of it and using ramps and stuff to get better, play the same level over and over so you can understand how to just and like bounce through it super fast.

Even watching you play made me feel like there's a sense of momentum. And when you add the music to that swelling, like it that's where the emotion comes from. It's momentum mixed with um this this auditory visual feedback combination that it's just like momentum. Momentum is a great way to describe it, Abzu.

Interesting. Where people have differing tastes and neither is right or wrong. It's like I can understand the arguments on both sides for this.

Like I didn't know what GTA 1 and 2 looked like until after I had played three. Sure. Um, but that game was unlike any other in the sense of the the um playground chatter of did you did you play this? Do you know what this go? There's prostitutes. You can you get a tank. There's cheat codes. You can get all these weapons. You can go anywhere you want. You can steal this car. You can steal that car. You can make that car spawn. Like you can set them all up. And it's just like what can't you do? Yeah. You know, and like",

Yeah, those are the little things.

Yeah. They have the characters, they have the games, they have the so they have so many genres covered. So many in unique different ways that the other guys don't do. No one else does.

I always thought of it as a console hybrid where it was backwards where I didn't want it to be it's a console that you can kind of take with you. The idea of it being a handheld that you can also play on the screen I think is the right way to think about it because then it's handheld first which is what Nintendo has always done right.

No. And I think that that this keeps that going. So it's not all just mobile games. Not to hate on mobile games. I think that had Nintendo backed out completely of hardware and made mobile games like real mobile games and uh PS4 and Xbox One games, my god, that would be amazing.

Like the numbers are all skewed into different things, but like I people always I mean like I I almost brought it up in excitement like I was wigging out for the Wii when the Wii came around.

We all have to figure out how not to get motion sick, what works, what doesn't, what a control scheme should feel like, what it shouldn't feel like. And that feedback is getting translated to developers who are then hopefully working on the next things. A a a prediction of how this looks. It's PlayStation Move. It comes out, the games are underwhelming, nobody, we all bought a bunch of them in the beginning, sure, and then nobody buys anymore and developers run from it and don't want to develop for it.

I think the fact that everybody's gotten sick playing it, the fact that you can play it without the VR, these are red flags for me. And the fact that everyone you talk to about VR, it needs to be built from the ground up for VR. You can't tack it into another game. You can't do something with it. The fact that people are getting motion sick tells me that's probably a big problem for it. And the fact that I think everyone's going to get it and be like, \"Yeah, a real game for VR.\" And put it on and be like, \"Oh, this is not I can't do this. This isn't what I I think it might be cart before the horse and the fact that like, hey, let's put out a real game, but we don't know the rules yet. We have to go and",

We have to go and learn so much about PlayStation or VR in general. So, the prediction, yeah, would be is a PlayStation Move thing. It would bring profits down, but again, you know, PlayStation as a brand just accounted for 76% of the profits for this quarter or whatever for Sony overall. So, that number comes down, sure, but they're still making hand over fist money on the PlayStation 4. That's I'm in the same boat where I don't think that I think that it's going to to fail overall in terms of it not being a huge success. I think that is the the marker for um how this does. Uh I but I think that it's not going to affect them too much. I think they know that going and that's and I think the success would be a surprise to them, right?

And that's the big thing with me where I keep banging this drum and saying the same thing, but Shuhei talks about it being Gen One PlayStation. They know they have a lot to learn. I feel like the fact that it is sold out, you can't get pre-orders anymore. It isn't because millions came out to pre-order. It's because they put out a limited amount of these cuz they're setting their expectations where they need to be. And gamers just need to do the exact same thing. And that's I think that's smart. I mean, obviously, it's an investment. They are putting a lot of money into this and trying to see where it goes and what it can be. And I talk about this all the time with Nintendo, but Nintendo uh with the Wii U and the Wii and all that stuff. All that innovation is just a gimmick that succeeds. That's it.

It No, I mean, you know what I mean? At the end of the day, we're looking back at it and we call it a gimmick. We don't call it waggle. Yeah. So, it's that if they had figured it out, had they found that game that one year down the line, we're going to get a lightsaber game or whatever, then it would have been the greatest innovation of all time. I think VR is the same thing and specifically PSVR - it is a gimmick. You need to go into it thinking it's a gimmick and if it happens to succeed then it's an innovation and then it's going to be super awesome and great but until then whatever it's going to be very similar to the Oculus Connect where they pushed it and now",

I'm doing all these different things. I still feel that for me as a personal when I get my VR unit, PlayStation VR unit, I'm going to use theater mode a lot. And I really think that is going to change the way I play games in the way of oh, Abz\u00fb's two and a half hours. Sure. Boom. Headphones.

All the things you're describing, that's such a personal thing to you.
