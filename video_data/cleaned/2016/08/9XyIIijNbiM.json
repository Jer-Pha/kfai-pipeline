So here's the deal Jared, I don't know much about Monster Hunter, I know it's a big deal, I know in Japan it's gigantic, I know everyone plays it, I have absolutely no idea about this game. I did uh one time I had to help someone at IGN review it so I like captured the video for them so I saw a bit of the gameplay never grabbed my attention too much. Pitch it to me, explain it to me, what are you wanting me Greg? It never grabbed your attention, mm fun Co-op play, cooking your own meat got all these cats that cook for you, you have cats, did you play Great? I used to like back in the day IG and reviewed everything okay which meant that games were dumped on your desk and they said review this it didn't it didn't matter if you knew nothing about it so yeah for the I did what two or three PSP Monster Hunters back in the day a bunch of PSP, did you ever do the original PS2",

You go to McDonald's, four-person tables, four people playing, and the whole restaurant would just be groups of four people all sitting down on PSPs playing 400 Monster Hunter hunts together on like ad hoc Wi-Fi, yeah it was amazing. So what's the appeal of this game? Well, one is the depth and the fact that it's kind of an obtuse game - not quite to the degree that Dark Souls is, um, but it takes a while to learn your way around and there's a lot going on, like you said, yeah let's talk about the things going on you mentioned cooking meat, yeah you got you can't just go out and you're going to starve to death, but you can't just cook the meat, you also got to keep the stamina, but you're not just",

I mean there were accusations floating around that Dragon Quest IX had four-player parties, uh, because of Monster Hunter. I think that's a bit of a stretch honestly because I would have been very upset if they did that, yeah. But yeah, but um, Monster Hunter is... let's talk about that multiplayer element. I don't play a tremendous number of non-couch multiplayer games; I really prefer to play with people in the room it's because I'm old and grumpy, um, and uh, but Monster Hunter is a delightful online experience because it is purely beautifully cooperative in a way that very few games are.

Wow, I talked a long time is the Everlasting Gobstopper. Yeah, I don't know, I'm calling it. I mean, what does this ever hold any appeal for you? No, I, uh, I played one Monster Hunter game a long time ago. It's just not for me. What's funny is that there are certain games that are informed in some way by Monster Hunter that I actually enjoyed quite a bit. But Monster Hunter to me was always so unnecessarily deep. For instance, I don't mind deep games; I love Civilization. The game is incredibly deep, but it's because I can just sit there and think about it. You know? Like, I'm not actively thinking about it; it's very passive. Yeah, so I can.",

People thought there weren't many legitimate killer apps in all of video game history in Japan, but Monster Hunter was the killer app for that handheld generation period. It was the reason people bought the handheld; there were people who only played it all the time and just waited for the next one to come so is so Generations is the latest game correct? Generations okay cool, and so you're saying that that is it the best jumping in point or is there another one no jump into Generations, that's so yes I think Generations is where you start, you get your 3DS um if you don't have a GameCube controller buy one if you have a New 3DS you don't need one um but you can play it with that one but I don't recommend it um back to the claw yeah yeah otherwise you're well",
