And then there's a good there's a small portion that might be as loyal following so I just want to get your guys' perspective on this because he said that now he's forecasting that into June and July he will actually start to make his money like he will break even on it, and then he can take it to Netflix or to Hulu or to Vimeo wherever he wants to go, whatever the next platform is. But it's fascinating to me that a guy of his stature - because he's arguably one of the most well-known comedians in mainstream media today - would choose to do that while copying us basically, which is what I'm trying to say: copy how we do things right, which is just to develop our own little audience, market to our audience, and just live in that ecosystem.

Um, and so from what I understand he didn't want help making this thing, he wanted to control it all himself, which I completely understand from a creative standpoint. And when you go through a studio or go through Netflix, they usually have a say in it; he just wanted to see what it was like to make something of high quality.

Like, I saw a couple of those articles too; I forget who the actress was that was talking to influencers, but she was talking in such a negative light. And when I originally heard the story about Louis C.K., and I'm actually a Louis C.K. fan - my first thought was, \"Hey, stay in your own world over there, buddy. Don't come into our world and try to market because you're going to lose money; you don't understand how this works.\" But then I'm like, no, that's stupid because all he's trying to do is evolve, which is all you can really do - evolve or die.

It's it's not so much that is it brilliant or not, that at the time definitely was brilliant. That was a game changer in the way that you know people just consume content that's what we do like so much of that I don't even think Patreon could exist if that you know moment didn't happen. Um, but at the same time it's like it's not that it was a brilliant idea, it's the fact that it was different. So it's like instead of spending a bunch of money on marketing to get you know little square ads to be on IGN, like you're just putting the it's not even so much money as much as the effort in a different way and like if you can make headlines for how you're marketing your thing you're going to be way better off than\"",

Um, same with film actors right we're like Chris Pratt's hot right now too, like Ryan Reynolds was hot 10 years ago right up until Deadpool he was really not getting any work now Grant I don't think he was hurting for money but still he's not in control of his own",

We're doing that on a micro level every day here, and so it's interesting to me that a guy like Louis C.K. would be like \"I can work with these people and that's cool\" or I could market it to a smaller audience have way more creative control over this control over my destiny in general and just maybe get - I can I can get my money back from these people, I've proven from the sales and my other stuff that it might take 13 months but I will get get the money back and then I'll be in the in uh in the black and making more money off this thing.
