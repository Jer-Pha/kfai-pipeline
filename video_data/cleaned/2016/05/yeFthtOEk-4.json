It may strategically choose not to do so; however, a two-million-dollar penalty will be assessed for each unused screen, and the total sum of all penalties will be deducted from the player's box-office total at the end of Comic-Con. That's interesting. There you go. See, yeah, it could be that I'm gonna put Neighbors on to that's looking really pleased with enough money for one movie but then I have five so I'm 10 million dollars out all managed to play against that Bastion more interesting exactly super super interesting I like that if a player does not select any movies for their Cineplex, all movies from the prior week that are available in the current week will automatically be carried over.",

Is this is what I was concerned about is opening up to everyone as you can't guarantee everyone's gonna play and then this in the standings will be useless and the bigger the league gets the more useless sustaining will be important note that's right that's one of my major reasons why wouldn't open it up okay go on um the actual box office earnings of the movie featured on each screen is the is the player's fantasy Cineplex, the player's fantasy Cineplex are added together to form a total score for the week that's easily the total of all weeks during season is cumulated for ranking purposes but does not carry over from one season to another I think those are",
