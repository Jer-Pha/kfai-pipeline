I mean, it's not so much that I've searched for it, but the whole \"I'm your dad, you're my daughter, and we're banging\" thing. I get sucked into it. I'm just like, it's weird. I'm not into it. Yeah, it's definitely there. How does it happen? You know, how do they get to the next level? I want to know. I'll tell you what I don't like this current trend of cam girl content where it's like, yeah, this was a live stream, but I've just put it on this site and every 5 seconds like, \"Thanks, hun. Thanks. Oh, you know, I hate that, but I watch it. But I watch it. I'm not allowed to watch it. So, Michael, today's question comes from 26-year-old Kevin. Kevin says, \"I've been straight jerking off since I was 13, and I feel like over time the search terms I've looked for have gotten weirder and weirder. Is this okay? I don't know if okay\"",

I don't know if okay needs to play into this. Yeah. Like I don't think that there's a good there's no real uh accepted rule when it comes to this stuff. Uh aside from maybe just make sure everything you're searching for is legal within the confines of the United States of America or wherever you are. Wherever you are the internet. See, I mean here's this is where this gets a little bit tricky and I need to be careful with my words here. It's not so much that what you're looking for is legal as much as what that implies and you knowing that it's okay. For example, when you search for teen, you're not actually looking for teen cuz that would be creepy and weird. You're looking for one is this guy might be you shouldn't you shouldn't do that. That would be bad. But uh teen usually means, you know, we're talking like",

Porn is such a vast vast ocean uh that you just you got to swim in. You know what I mean? You got to first you kind you walk into it but you're a little bit wet and you're a little scared for it to hit this region because it's really cold and you get up to the nips and you're just like but once you hit that point then you just go straight in and then you just kind of dip for you once my testicles are in there looking back. I feel like you don't have to feel bad about the inevitable escalation in the search term. Well, also he said he was 26. You know, you figure that's someone who grew up with the internet. It's hard.

You know, you couldn't just click click click in your Oh, no. You had to like figure it out. You had growing up with it. Like even even when I was like 18, I remember waiting for the boobies to load. My thing that I found is I either go straight teen or straight milf. Like I don't want I don't want none of these like 30-year-olds. Like no. Who wants that? Yeah. Get out of here. I have a I have a wide like I I cast a wide net when it comes to my liking in the online porn.

Um but I will say I I sympathize with you because after a certain point and this is actually a real issue like you do become desensitized to quote unquote like normal pornography mentally and physically. Very much true. Um and so I've gotten to the point where I've just started throwing random words in the search term just to see what comes up and it's always fascinating. And literally I got so far down the rabbit hole the other day I typed the word love to see what would happen. So that's nothing. No, you got you got all sorts of like really nice like well-made poor woman like the weirdest thing now is this new uprising in like the DSLR like there's not weird music underneath it. It's just like two people making love. I'm into it. I'm into it.

I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Yeah. I would say try sounding next if you haven't done that. That's crazy. That's when you put something in your dick. Oh god. No. Like like a Michael like a metal rod. Oh my god. Michael, thank you very much for joining us. Where can people find you? They'll find me right here in this warehouse.
