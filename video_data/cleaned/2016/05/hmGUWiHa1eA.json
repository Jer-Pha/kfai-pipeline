The first day is going to be a completely ridiculous stage show but we have planned this year and it completely blows last year out of the water, and I don't even know how that's possible because we were really stupid last year and this year's somehow even stupider. Day two is going to be a full day of meet and greets; we're hanging out with all of us, a bunch of Rooster Teeth people are there, Funhaus people are there, Achievement Hunter it's going to be a grand old time. There's going to be some games to play, there's going to be signings, it's it's exciting, it's a really fun time. There's going to be exclusive merch; oh yeah, this is definitely going to be exclusive merch.

I actually think that Uncharted's not gameplay is King typically, but I think Uncharted is really one of the examples where I'm like, \"Is it really King in this game?\" I don't think so. I mean they're you know the king of third person shooters, even Gears of War is way better, Vanquish is way better, there's a bunch of third person shooters that are better but that's not what we're playing Uncharted for um so I was listening to the review yesterday after we because we I had I had reviewed it with you guys you had beaten and you were very patient with me and and and uh waiting for me to beat it um and I beat it yesterday and I was I was kind of Blown Away by it, the end and um it went a different direction than",

I had way more fun playing Uncharted, and I think that it's not necessarily talking about the gameplay but as an experience all of that does go out the window because it was so much fun, and I couldn't stop thinking about it. Ratchet when I was playing it, I could step away from it for a bit; Uncharted just had me totally, and even now that it's done, even though I'm not playing it anymore, it's like all I can think about\u2014it's all I want to talk to everybody about\u2014and I wonder how long that'll last. And the good news is I think it will last through the rest of the year; I think that this is going to be a game that we keep talking about going back to forever in the same way we do about the other Uncharted, Ratchet and Clank.

Um, Ratchet & Clank - I don't think we're going to be talking about much of it, no. I don't think so either. But it's funny; in a weird way, Ratchet had me hooked more because it was not expected that it was going to be as good as it was, and I was just like kept remarking to myself, \"Wow, this is fun! Like, I'm having fun - look how much fun I'm having.\" And Uncharted is a fun experience, but it was an experience; it was like watching a movie. It's like I almost didn't want to play it sometimes; I'm like, \"I just wish that I could...\" Erin remarked to me, saying these things - meaning the cut scenes were like my favorite part. I'm like, \"Mine too, you know?\" Like so, like I wish that...like you know, it's fun walking around looking for treasure and fighting in these gun battles and platforming and all that kind of stuff.",

I was in love with Awakening so much, so when it came out, I kind of wasn't anticipating it. So when it got there, I was kind of like, \"I'll get it when I get it.\" Started playing it and I'm like, \"Man, damn, they got me,\" I'm hooked. And the fact that that game kept giving me more because there's three games to play... um, it did not for me on planes where it's just like it never ends, there's just more and more and more. Now there's DLC coming out. I just think Five Houses has this very special uh gameplay where it's just... and especially portable, it's great.

They wish they'd kind of go away for a little while now; it's like 15 of them, it's like okay, they're great games, I love them, but that last one was left much to be desired. Um, so that was really cool news to see, or whatever, but what I was going to say is my takeaway right now is that we were talking on PS4 about kind of the dir (of) PS4 exclusives like triple exclusives that are really worthwhile and in terms of like AAA exclusive; so I love Ratchet & Clank and all the Horizon Zero Dawn stuff, but I mean in terms of like you go into a store and you spend $60 or $40 because Ratchet's a AAA game; um, Bloodborne was really the only one that was like really, really amazing to a lot of people, and I think Infamous: Second Son and Killzone were kind",

I think to a lot of people and I think Infamous and Killzone were kind of on a below that level, and then everything else like Knack and The Order \u2013 everyone can kind of take her leave. And it's so funny that within a 3-week period or so, or less than a month, Ratchet and Uncharted are coming out, which are basically the first and second best exclusives on the console. And so my takeaway is that PS4 is finally getting its games. I mean those two games alone justified my PS4 entirely \u2013 not that I didn't have great experiences before \u2013 but in terms of like exclusive stuff, it's done it's like that is totally worth the investment because they are amazing.
