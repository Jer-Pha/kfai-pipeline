The first day is going to be a completely ridiculous stage show; what we have planned this year completely blows last year out of the water, and I don't even know how that's possible because we were really stupid last year, and this year's somehow even stupider. Day two is going to be a full day of meet-and-greets; we're hanging out with all of us, a bunch of Rooster Teeth people are there, Funhaus people are there, Achievement Hunter it's going to be a grand old time; there's going to be some games to play, there's going to be signings; it's it's exciting, it's a really fun time; there's going to be exclusive merch. Oh yeah, there's definitely going to be exclusive merch.

Right, like which Masterpiece is the best Masterpiece, cuz they're all amazing games it seems unfair. And especially it's just it wraps everything up and like so what Uncharted is the best Uncharted? It's probably Uncharted 4. I feel the gameplay is the best there. I feel the story is the most coherent and I was into it the whole time. Uh, the ending let Al... the ending like before we even get to the epilog and then into the epilog is awesome. And then the epilog itself.

Right now we have a job to do.\" And it's like... yeah. And then right after the next battle Drake's like \"you know what?

So I don't know, I mean if you're putting a gun in my head literally, I would say yeah, I, I think it's still so fresh which I hate doing 'cause you remember it took me years to say Peace Walker was my favorite game of all time 'cause I needed I couldn't just let it usurp Metal Gear without anything but yeah probably Uncharted 4 is the best in the series. I agree completely. Um, I disagree in the sense that uh like I think that uh this game is a hundred times better if you play the other three.

You're in there and I feel like it organically gets into via him as a conduit, introduces him to Elena and him to Sully in a way that to the player could introduce them to these characters and what they mean.

The only thing being the set pieces. Because you think back to Uncharted 2 and even Uncharted 3, like it has these crazy moments. The more I think about it, I really enjoyed the set pieces in Uncharted 4. Well is Nick here? I um I really really really like it. And it's funny because so many people say oh well nothing could ever compare to Uncharted 2 because that was so fresh and new to us back then. For me I didn't play two and three until Nathan Drake Collection last year when you discovered I was correct and uh no it's when I discovered you were actually wrong all those years about Uncharted 3 um but again three is amazing and like I would never say that it's not a near perfect game but",

They think I'm crazy for getting **** about my Uncharted score, right? It's not even people calling me out that I say that Uncharted 3 is better than two - it's the fact that Uncharted 3 got a 10 from IGN and Uncharted 2 got a 9.5.
