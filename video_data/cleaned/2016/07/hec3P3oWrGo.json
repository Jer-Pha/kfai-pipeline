My topic... uh I want to talk about the weirdest hotel rooms you've stayed at or the weirdest hotel experiences in general. And this came up because Chris Oster tag um video Grandpa on Twitter tweeted me a picture of a hotel that we stayed at one time that I totally had blocked from my memory because it was arguably the worst experience of my life. Um, it was in Amsterdam; we went out there for a uh a gig that we were both doing as freelancers for my friend Brennan... they flew us out uh and put us up.

Um, and yelling and screaming and having a good time as one does when they go to a convention called PAX East Expo, right?

Like the year prior to that we stayed at the W Hotel, same hotel, same accommodation is good but it was just a little farther off so people weren't doubling up to a room over there.

I don't think about it, don't think about it. Go, it could have been spiders. I thought it was going to be spiders. You could have been used condoms exactly. No, there's a lot, and that's why I said it wasn't a real bad one. It was just like one of those things \u2013 the LA one, of the I'd already had my last straw for that. I accept it, most because we stay usually at nice hotels. I accept that stuff has gone down in that hotel room. I mean, I know we've all contributed to it. I know what I've done.

So the entire crew comes back to this thing and we just all stood there for a second and looked at this gorgeous motel that we were staying at, that we had no idea about until we returned at night. And it was really, really cool. I mean, some of us barbecued, some of us left, and some of us ended up staying there that night. Um, but that was a really good memory ever since then. I'm like, I want to do... I'd always... I want to do another short about that hotel. Well, we did. We were like... like we had just done this awesome, like western style of thing.
