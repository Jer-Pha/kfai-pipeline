All right, topic three: We're doing something a little bit different today thanks to my boy Steven Inler, Patreon producer. Once we're going to do two topics of audience questions because there was a whole bunch good whole bunch and they were good, they were they were good. Some of them are all over the place; some of them not so good but that's why I gotcha okay all right Blackheart vinyl has a long one here: \"Hey guys, I want to talk about the relaunch of Evolve, but in a broader sense because I know you guys didn't play the game.

And I mean look at us, like the videos we started making and now what we're trying to make, and we have an animated show and different stuff. We moved to Studio, it's all about that learning curve. Definitely next question comes from cm14 says hi guys, what do you think of the Final Fantasy XV theory that Luna is connected to the Shadows of the First Sun from VII, the theory that they are connected sounds so cool. The Emerald weapons in the King's Glaive trailer, I can't wait for Final Fantasy XV.

It's the same thing with Dragon Quest, with slimes and all this kind of stuff. But they're um, and they do have arcs. I mean, those games are paired in threes, but um, I don't know.

Then I think that they can probably play that up. Yeah, Ali Pardi says, \"Hey guys, what happened to cheat codes and why did they exist in the first place?\" I always thought the developers put them in so they could access levels and weapons, etc., while showcasing the game to press. No, because there's debug modes in games. So, um, if you play a game on a test kit, um, or a debug kit, um, this is like we have PS4s and PS3s that play debug software, which is like software that's not done; they play it on burn discs usually, and um, or you can play it on a dongle or whatever. It's basically a way to access the games, and like you'll notice that... All right, so I played Horizon on a debug PS4, and uh, the guy wanted to reset put me somewhere else, and so like the code, like uh, developers put like different code or different input.",

So I miss codes, but I also don't think that they have a place in modern games at all like I don't think that they even work in certain things like when NBA Jam came back, yeah cool that should have cheats because that makes sense, sure. Um, um, but I can't even imagine how cheats would fit into a Call of Duty, you know? Yeah, and then it breaks it and then it breaks it for other people are you're playing it on like the thing that I the I never really used codes, I didn't care much.
