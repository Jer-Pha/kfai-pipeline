The additions that would make this get in our rating in Greg Miller's mind are very simple and very small. There's a **** remember the guy who lost his legs? I can't feel my legs. Wally, remember Batman, your man, the guy who kind of feels like he lost his legs blows up the capital crucial character to the plot. He says **** it. The wheelchair guy says **** it. One point when Lois is in the bathtub and Clark gets in the bathtub, we all remember the glasses hit the water splashes. We cut away; here we cut back. Superman sits up takes off his shirt - yolked out - then comes in for the makeout, and we get a scene from behind of Lois clutching his back. You're like, \"All right, that doesn't seem too far\"",

NC-17 formerly X: no one 17 admitted a movie that in the view of the ratings board most parents would consider patently too adult for children 17 and under. So you know, that goes on NC-17 does not mean OB scene or pornographic in the common legal meaning of those words, and should not be construed as a negative judgment in any sense. Is it possible that they... I don't want to say because I know the MPAA or whatever is not on the take, whatever, but like they wanted the R rating didn't they?

It goes on, of all the Indiana, all the films in the series, Indiana Jones, and the Temple of Doom is the darkest part of it. Was going through I was going this is explaining like this until 1984 there had only been four ratings a film could receive: G, PG, R, and X.

That's why Spielberg did it and that's why Red Dawn was the first movie to be released as PG-13 - I told you. But to be fair, I am also obsessed with Red Dawn. Was right. Uh, here's the thing about it though: Point come back. I used to mean I saw dozens of movies when I was a kid rated movies with my friends or by myself even like I remember going to see something about Mary by myself when my dad saw some other movie when I was in eighth grade um and I would just buy the ticket for I'd be like I you know oh I want to see",

Um, but the reason I have no problem with the rating, the ESRB or the MPAA, is because they are bodies, organized bodies, have nothing to do with the government. The thing is, is that the ESRB actually was created in the mid-90s because the government was like, \"You do it,\" or we'll \"do it.\" The government was getting ready to, and that would have been like, \"That's a bridge too far.\" Why is the video even involved?

Okay, before we finish because I'm sure we're almost there, there were two or three trailers before the Abomination I saw this weekend, and one was for Suicide Squad, which I think was fun; I want to see it. I'm not convinced it's going to be good. Did you guys see the trailer for Suicide Squad that uses \"Pony\" cuz it's ****? It's a we need to watch Resurgence and I blame us, but the other um, but the other trailer I saw was for Ghostbusters: Answer the Call, which I think is a trailer I've seen before. People I want to just give a little perspective because I'm of two minds with this movie where I feel like it's going to bomb and I also feel like it's going to be fine; uh, where there was a lot of laughter and um and uh Chuckles during during it from the people in the",
