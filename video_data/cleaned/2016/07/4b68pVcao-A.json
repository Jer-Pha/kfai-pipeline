We did fantasy movie League; we bet $100. I do yeah, of course, the most serious game I do is in that fantasy football league with my uncle and his friends where you know you can lose a lot of money but no more than usually 500 bucks or something like that. You win, you can win an ass-ton of money in the league, like $5,000. So um, but I, I kind of like have started to pay closer attention to gambling culture the last few times I had gone there and like what it is to gamble, and I got lost at a blackjack table myself one night for two nights actually, but one night for like a long time, um, and realized that uh, man, I get it now. You know, like uh, I got it in such a way where I'm like, I can't do this anymore, actually, because oh really, it's it's it's not even it's not even that I'm trying to win; it's that I'm",

You sit out a few hands if you're losing, and you kind of get a read on the table. I enjoyed it, so I was curious: what you guys think of gambling in general?

And no, it's really not the end of the world.\" So, I'm saying is, I enjoyed it, so I want to hear your guys' stories. I wish I got more um, I like Blackjack fine. I had a similar experience in St Louis at a bachelor party on the Riverboat down there where I sat down at a good table and it was one where the guy next to me saw me struggling and then started like coaching me.

Oh sure, like easily one hand, and to Colin's earlier point, these casinos don't make it hard for you; they don't give a **** if you're drunk or not; they don't care if you're got a mortgage, your don't, and that's great. I mean, that's kind of like what it's not great; it's completely insidious and it's horrible, but that's what Vegas is right?

And like you know, it was uh, it was just a nice experience. I wanted to share with you guys see if you guys have any anecdotes as well. Um, Tim did you say anything about gambling? No, I was eight years old, it was like a freaking weird little festival thing and it was kind of like one of those Chuck-E-Cheese situations where there's like all the like arcade games with tickets and stuff.

And it became this whole thing of like getting more money to fund more tokens to get more tickets to get these James Bond things. And somewhere along the way, I'm like, how much would it cost to just buy James Bond cards? This is stupid. Yeah, I stopped there from then on. I'm like, I'm not going to gamble like this; this is dumb. There's better ways to make money, and that's why one day when I have time to look into stocks, I'm going to be a master of stocks.
