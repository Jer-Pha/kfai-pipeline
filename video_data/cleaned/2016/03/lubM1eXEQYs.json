I was reading it, found a really interesting thread by one of the Cake's, he says if you had to choose five games that best represent video games, which would you choose? So five essential games to best represent video games in general, don't factor in factors like oh well this game's too hard for a beginner. If it represents all video games in some way that you think should be mentioned then post it. I thought this was really interesting and reading through all the responses there wasn't really a through line really yeah like there's a couple things that come up a lot but then obviously that sparks the debates of well which Mario, well which Zelda, well see that's the thing for me when you present this topic Super Mario Brothers right like I feel like we we talk about it all the time right that that's like such a great example of a game period tight mechanics all these different things but also a game of like nowadays you start and",

Otherwise I would wish everything was a side scroller cuz that's awesome, I love side scrollers, but I think that's where we get five and we can we can even push it to a couple more like I guess what are the video games then? Like take the number out of it but just what are the games that that do define what video games are. You bring up a good point though because it's like, we're talking about you know the actual games themselves, like the code or are we talking about the industry? Because if you bring in Call of Duty then that also kind of speaks to franchises that also speaks to you know Tomb Raider and Assassin's Creed and stuff that like these are back every year so it's not just like\"",

I think that one of those spots needs to be for that obviously platformer, it'd be it'd be Mario, whether it's a 2D1 or a 3D1, I think the answer would be 2D but then I think I think a fighting game needs to be in there like I think there's something about like Street Fighter II that that is just it stands the test of time and like that is what a video game is, it's just competition. Like I would put Street Fighter over Pong you know, like I I obviously understand the the argument for Pong but I think that Street Fighter represents um more of the why people play video games and it's a similar thing in terms of the competitive aspect that makes sense yeah I don't this list is obtuse though because I that that's what I'm trying to like I don't.",

It would definitely be something like Candy Crush Saga or um, you know, some of these cell phone games that you see commercials for when you're trying to watch football. Uh, and then that Schwarzenegger game, Game of the Year - yeah, you'd probably put something like that on there. You might not even put Call of Duty on there now; you might because Call of Duty's kind of waning in some way. You might even put something like Destiny on there. Um, so I don't know. I think it's more about putting something like Fallout - an open-world, nonlinear sometimes procedural RPG - um, on the list. Got to have an MMO in there somewhere; we got to have just something online that's the best right now. Final Fantasy XI, Game Over - but uh, yeah, just to kind of communicate that like this is a whole you know all of these people are playing the same game.",

That's it, that's your whole game. You could have a college course just on Ocarina of Time but there's a ton of text in that game. So if there was like a Russian guy came to me and I'm like \"here play this\" he couldn't, you know, he wouldn't be able to read those letters when they pop up in blue. But would that be better for an alien or someone else who like, you know, how many fingers do they have? I don't know. There are lots of parameters yeah. I mean I think the list that I would want to make would be the most important games just generally with the genetic code of video games from beginning to end and so... I'd put something like Space War from mainframe computers and punch cards",

Um, I would put something like Wolfenstein on the list I'd put Mario 64 on the list Paradigm shifting games and experiences as opposed to we were talking about it not too long ago about the last time because we were talking about how PS1, not PS4, doesn't really do anything that PS3 can't do except for its technical prowess like it's it's not giving us new experiences at all it's just and that's fine I don't think we want new experience.

But I think you can play Mario Bros and not have your head wrapped around video games the way Mario World needs there's more going on in Mario World. The other thing about COD is you get esports and that you have to show that you got to see a bunch of uh Korean people just screaming at a what because I mean we're we're in the industry and a lot of us are still like what am I looking at right now, when did this happen?

But it's it's like um I don't accept those parameters for myself because it would be about the games that I like, I mean that's basic basically what it what it comes down to like there are much better Platformers in the original Super Mario Bros and Super Mario 3 and Super Mario World like there are like and so like and so but they're not as important Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3 are way better games than the Super Mario games in my mind you know but",

Like, there are many more ideas in those games, and the platforming is more solid, I think too. But they're not as important; they're not as symbolic of the trend. I mean, the original Mario isn't the original side scroller; it's just that we look at it as the original sidescroller because we recognize sidescrollers. I mean, games like Pitfall existed before Mario, so it's not like...
