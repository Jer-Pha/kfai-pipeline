Yeah, have you been playing video games a little bit? What have you been playing? A little more of The Division. What level are you now? 13 maybe 14. I... uh... I tell you what, I had a lovely time at GDC. Yeah, I had a lovely time at South by Southwest. I desperately missed The Division. I can't wait to get back to The Division. It's a good game; it's a very good game. Level 19 is where I left the main character. The secondary character is level 13, I think level 12 somewhere in there. I gotta get back and get to 30. I gotta get into this Dark Zone. I gotta help Fran. I can't leave him out there unprotected. No, you must... I've been doing that. I've been Tuesday we have a date to",

Uh, go try it out if you'd like; see if that 2D hardcore grueling game is for you. You collect salt instead of souls to upgrade your character, you lose your salt if you die, and then you have to go back to the enemy that killed you to get it back and stuff like that. So, I mean, it is dark; it's not trying to hide it, and I respect that. Why go halfway if you can go all the way?

You will get the VR headset, a processor unit, the headset connection cable, an HDMI cable, a USB cable, stereo headphones, an AC power cord, and an AC adapter. The PlayStation VR doesn't come with a PlayStation camera, which is required, nor does it come with the PlayStation Move controllers, which are optional. Its external dimensions for the headset are 187 x 185 x 277 mm (counted width by height by length). The processor's dimensions, counted the same, are 143 mm by 36 mm by 143 mm. The headset weighs 610 G, and the processor unit weighs 365 G. Its display method is OLED, and the panel size is 5.7 in. The panel resolution is 1920 x RGB x one uh by 1080 or 960x RGB by 1080 per I. Its refresh rate is 90 to 120 Hz, its field of view is approximately 100\u00b0, it has six AI motion sensing systems built-in, three AI gyroscope and three AI accelerometers. You can connect an HDMI cord auxiliary cable and headphones into the headset; HDMI to TV, HDMI to PS4, a USB cable, and an",

I don't want to spoil too much of what Shuhei says here about why the camera is not bundled in but I think he has something interesting to say about it that was not what I expected him to say about it.

So, is working for them right? The price we talk about - the Optics of it - that it is so much cheaper than Oculus, that it is so much cheaper than Vive. It's half the cost of Vive, and that it's approachable. You know what I mean? Like, right now we have a Vive in the living room, and Kevin keeps asking me every day, \"What are we doing with it?\" What are we doing with it? Can I take it home? Don't take it home because one day no, we're going to use it for stuff. But it's like, we should sell it.

It's not to say gaming has a very intimate relationship with Computing; it's just to say that the technology was proven later IBM PCs weren't sold in 1981, 1982 on the back of games; it was sold on the back of spreadsheets. So to have this technology come fourth and be like we are going to prove VR with games is exciting and it could be daunting but I do think that the the the application of this is going to be obvious like immediately it's going to be obvious to people much smarter than us about what to do with it and it's not going to have anything to do with games now we might be playing games on PSVR or just VR generally in 10 or 20 years I'm sure we will be but I hope that we don't think",

Our sources aren't sure when this upgraded machine will ship to consumers nor how much it will cost. The PS4's price dropped from $400 to $350 last fall, and one source indicated that this new PS4.5 could let Sony keep selling PS4 hardware at a higher profit margin for $400. There are still a lot of big questions surrounding the device: Will Sony allow people to trade in their existing PS4s to buy their new machine? How will developers cope with releasing games on multiple types of hardware? I don't think they will. Could some games only support PS4.5 as is the case with the New Nintendo 3DS? I don't think so.
