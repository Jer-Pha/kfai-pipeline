And I think they made the world dangerous because it's one of those things I think I agree with you. I felt like when I was playing I was I was you know definitely upgrading quicker and I think it's just based on the fact that you have to because you can't find an M16 or this that or the other, you know what I mean?

Another good diversion, I feel like for my Vita. Cool, I like the name. Yeah, no, that's a good one. And considering it takes place on the stage, I would say my standout so far.

What do you think's going to be happening? What is the price going to be? What are the capabilities going to be? Is there a bundle?

Number two, of course, there is Sony has filed a patent for a glove controller that can be used in conjunction with PlayStation VR. The three patents associated with the glove controller were dug up by NeoGAF user Roasty or Rosty Rasty. The patent applications were filed in the United States between September 30th and October 17th of 2014, and were published on February 25th, 2016. Here's what the applications say in part: so he or she broke out pertinent information says the abstract of the patent says \"A glove interface object is provided comprising at least one flex sensor configured to generate flex sensor data identifying a flex at at least one finger portion of the glove interface object, corresponding with your fingers; at least one contact sensor configured to generate\"",

A Communications module is configured to transmit the flex sensor data and the contact sensor data to the Computing device for processing, to determine a finger position pose of the **PS Move** glove interface object; the finger position pose being applied for rendering a virtual hand in a view of a virtual or environment or a head-mounted display. The virtual hand is rendered based on the identified finger position pose.

They float around.

Move a lot of units. I wonder when eventually just going to abandon it, mhm. Probably not for a while, but eventually they're going to... eventually in two years we're probably going to get maybe one free-to-play game, no PS3 games, and then maybe four or five PS4 games.

Dev is likely (hopefully won't be) looking only at the PSVR install base, that'll be looking at what Oculus plus PSVR plus Vive install base is. I assume SLH hopes the porting between Oculus and PSVR will be a similar process as porting from PC to PS4, so even if it's not exclusive, the total install base between the different variations of VR may be worth the investment. I'm not a programmer, and could be completely wrong; just a thought. Greg guy 1926: Well, I don't think it's... I mean, I'm with you, don't get me wrong.

However, nowadays anytime I'm listening to a podcast or browsing gaming forums, Assassin's Creed III is commonly maligned as one of if not the worst Assassin's Creed games.
