But at the same time, you know, I don't know if history is going to remember that so much as they remember he's the guy that revolutionized the way we interact with each other, um, which is pretty crazy, I think. But I think there's a happy medium somewhere in there. I don't think you have to go all out; you can have a lot, but prioritization is a really huge factor of both success and happiness as well. Because there's one thing to be said: it's depressing when you think, \"I want to do all these things,\" but you can't do any of them because you don't have time, so it's crippling. Right?

In the chat room, it doesn't mean it's not bad; it's not like evil or dark, or it's very transparent. The chat is built to make conversation amazing and positive. Management is the same way, personal management: when you're managing a person or a team or people, when you see a behavior that is amazing, you call it out and you write an amazing email. One of the greatest CEOs that I know, um, wrote this; I saw this email that he wrote to the team.

I think a lot of CEOs would send an email back be like \"so **** tell facilities and shut up go away.\" Dan, the CEO, writes an email to the entire company - tens of thousands of people - attaches a picture and says \"everybody look at this email that I just got. This is high-level; look at how aware and how awesome this employee is. Look at how much they care about this company that they even care about the trash overflowing. Trash when you drive into work, it's not nice to see overflowing dumpsters.\" So he reinforced that positive behavior and it empowers everyone at the company.
