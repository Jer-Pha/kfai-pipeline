I want to talk about Fuller House, but not so much the show itself, although we can talk about the show itself if we like. But more about these kind of old school things coming back, not really old school, but things from our childhood coming back pretty old and if we really need it. This was the question I was asking myself when I was watching Fuller House because I only made it through two episodes where I'm like this is just terrible so it's just the show, it's more of the show, like that's what I was saying when we were talking about this with at dinner or",

I watched three episodes, I watched the first two and I was like, \"like this is bad.\" I had it on in the background, I was playing Vita and then I jumped to the Hunter Pence episode, I was like, \"all right, cool, I've done my due diligence or whatever and I've seen Hunter our boy so I can move on\" and I was like, \"this is this is bad.\" But Full House was always bad, yeah. But of course, the I mean that's that doesn't matter because the context is different we were kids when we saw these and so we have um different memories and different ideas of what Full House really was and uh also it was kind of a kid show back then right like it wasn't supposed to be a Netflix exclusive kind of rated R program not that this one is but that's not what Netflix has to be well you know what I mean like it's day it was supposed",

Like, it was supposed to be programming for family viewing in the evening around 7 o'clock, you know, TGIF all that stuff. So bringing it back now is just a totally different era. Like we don't even... Yeah, and this is what I'm wondering because this isn't kind of exclusive to Fuller House, and I mean The X-Files. Not that I was an X-Files fan, but The X-Files came back, and apparently it's atrocious. Um, the uh, you know we're gonna get Twin Peaks back, and that was like really tortured and stuff like that, and Baywatch is coming back, and all this... So I'm wondering, like first of all if you guys saw and what you thought of it because I I the first uh I was reading a review before I even watched the the first episode and they were saying that like the first episode is uh kind of the season finale",

No, no, it was that they were too busy; they couldn't come back for the going-away party because they you know are busy in New York running their fashion line and then they all or what her I guess and then they all look at the camera and like hold it and the audience goes crazy and stuff like they all break the fourth wall for it.

Ryan Bloodworth says here's some background if relevant why not it's your topic Ryan you can do whatever you want. My girlfriend and I recently had a lively disagreement involving how we each wear our shoes specifically tennis shoes or sneakers when I commented on what I considered to be her odd tendency to leave her shoes tied and simply slip them on and off. I asserted that this must be very abnormal as my shoes when tied are far too tight for me to even imagine achieving that feat, pardon the pun. A cursory Google search suggested however that her behavior is perhaps more common.\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n* \"kindof funny\" \u2192 \"kindafunny\"\n* \"Ryan Bloodworth\" (kept as is since it's a proper name and already capitalized)\n* \"Castlevania\" (added capitalization to match the game title)\n* Removed extra punctuation marks\n* Kept all other text intact, including filler words and phrases.",
