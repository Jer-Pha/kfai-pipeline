Like, there are many more ideas in those games, and the platforming is more solid, I think too. But they're not as important; they're not as symbolic of a trend. I mean, the original Mario isn't the original Sidescroller; it's just that we look at it as the original Sidescroller because we recognize side-scrollers. I mean, games like Pitfall existed before Mario, so it's not like... To me, it's the same thing with Shooters. Like, there is some Wolfenstein - really is the first first-person shooter, but it's not really the first first-person game.

So I mean that's like more where I think things become important, and then you have to kind of lay out your list like that. I don't know but it's tricky because if you understand D&D then you don't you already get that, you know it's like you don't have to explain that someone in video games so it's like you mention reading you're like well reading is a part of games but it's like odds are the person you're talking to understands how to read and understands that if a character is talking to them in the game they can respond to them",
