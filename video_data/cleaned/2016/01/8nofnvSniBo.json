Topic two is going to be PlayStation, so we're going to review all the PlayStation exclusive games, both Vita and PS, and just kind of review PlayStation's year overall. Then Nintendo, then Xbox with a couple of PC and mobile stuff will add all in that into one little thing just because all the **** we don't care about not as knowledgeable about that subsection of the the Tomb Raider.

Not mundane activities; they were fun. I enjoyed leveling up and building my character, and you know, D&D. But for me, Fallout 4 is about me and this one companion I chose, and then fell in love with, and then... you know what I mean? Like that's the story of Fallout 4. Whereas like Fallout 3, you go down, meet this robot who thinks he's Thomas Jefferson... the first time you run into a Super Mutant or Behemoth... those are like standout moments: \"Oh my God, that was crazy.\" In Fallout 4, I do feel it hit the spot, loved it.

Col uh, I played for like 25 hours, went out to breakfast with a friend of mine yesterday, um, and we were talking about the game; he's playing it as we speak, and we both kind of agreed it's just not Fallout 3 - and that's a shame because it is it's a good, it's a great game, I think it's a fantastic game actually, but it's the bar was set so high by its predecessors that I I think that's why I just fell out of it. I just didn't feel like playing it anymore; I've really barely touched it since it came out, actually.

It's weird; it's a weird game. I'm not quite sure what they were thinking with this game. Um, I mean we know what Kadokawa and those guys were thinking - they wanted to do... they wanted a stepping stone, a dang RPG 3, and I don't think they were ready for it yet, so they made a weird quirky third-person shooter. It's bizarre; it's a bizarre game.

I'm not sure 100% if it's story and I should probably look it up because I talk about it ever so often.

This one in 3 years will be the same way - of like, I remember there was this guy and these people and they wanted that, and then at the end they were totally setting up for a third, so that's what they did, you know? Mhm. Rare Replay, I want to give a shout out to that just as being one of the best compilation games I've ever played - it made me care about games I don't care about. And you know we we did a a let's play series where we kind of played through all of them even a lot of the really early really shitty games, but it it was fun that they presented it in a way that made me want to try them out and want to appreciate them for what they are. I loved the whole theater look of it and I loved the all the modes that they added - the challenge modes and the the um I forgot what they were called, but like maybe they were replay modes.",
