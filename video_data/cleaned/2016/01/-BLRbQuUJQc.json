Mmm, I'm trying to get a copy right now, and even then, I'm gonna be behind on it, but that's supposed to be really good too. So we'll keep an eye on that one. And then third honorable mention, The Witcher 3. Mm, The Witcher 3 - this year, I really... I was you know in the mood. Oh, we hit $45,000 on Patreon.com slash Kinda Funny, thank you very much.

He talked about how Act one does go on too long but Act two and three pick up and get crazy, and that's really where it is. And oh well, I never got out of Act 1 or whatever, you don't know. I mean I was gonna run through it, I'd like to see why so many people freak out about it - when we say now my game leave you're freaked out about it, so many people lose their **** and say it's the best, and I've put hundreds of hours in it and I beat it.

Batman: Arkham Origins was set up as this game about Black Mask hiring all these people - you're like, \"That sounds pretty cool.\" And then you played Arkham Origins, and I think it was in the first hour, but maybe the first hour and a half, where it's like, \"Aha, no, it's not. I'm the Joker, and this is the Joker's origin story.\" And you were like, \"Holy ****, that was whoa yes yes a million times.\" You played through, and it was awesome. It doesn't get enough credit as a game or Batman/Joker story because it's amazing.

Where, like, in the Arkham Asylum right where you all of a sudden start walking around as Bruce Wayne, you know what I mean? After his parents get shot, and your baby Bruce Wayne or whatever. Or, you know, then in Arkham City you get dropped into Mad Hatter's thing, and it's all twist around. It's like for so long it's just been I'm running around fighting criminals, and all of a sudden now I'm in this weird world of the Scarecrow emissions, racing on the ground, and stuff.

I looked at my game clock and it was something like 64 hours platinum in Arkham Knight then did all the DLC trophies and before I got... I probably put like 75 or 80 hours in Arkham Knight according to it, you know what I mean? Maybe you know, 70 to 80 will say somewhere in there based on the fact that I think was 64 before I really launched into the deal. See you every week and that's preposterous. I did not expect that when we were talking about Arkham Knight when we were looking into Arkham Knight ahead of time, you know?

And so I remember, I think it was Mitch who came back and said \"you're gonna love this, it's Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker\" - you know what I mean? I'm like, \"oh my god.\" And then Ground Zeroes came out. I took a day off work to play that on stream with him, and I put around 10 hours in and got through the main mission and tried to do all the side stuff, but like, I'm getting captured every five seconds - I feel totally impotent in this game. And I like the way the concrete walls got there on the side, I'm like it doesn't feel freeing, it feels more constricting, you know what I mean? And I'd never... it was like whatever. And so then when we left a year ago today and I got invited to that preview thing, I went down, previewed it, like this is cool, I'm excited to play. And then it was like \"you played that, holy ****\" - like this is awesome. And I came back and told you...",

Any meme like that is in this what I always say, and it gets me a lot of hate. I really wish that would have come to PlayStation because I'd love to add that platinum to my collection. Like, I there's so many other things I want to play that I don't wanna invest in Xbox to get a thousand points because I'm just not an achievement guy, you know what I mean? But playing through that game, it was just so good, it was so much fun to play... the story again though totally forgettable.
