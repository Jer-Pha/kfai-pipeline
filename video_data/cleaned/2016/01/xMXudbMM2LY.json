So I propose, I mean, we could do the two shots in sequence, but I don't think that's going to be, I mean. No, I think we should space them out. Yeah.

And I was going to say, we're drinking Matty Kerr's whiskey that he brought over from Montana. Yeah, so Matty Kerr brought us awesome, this is straight rye whiskey, early release. Only aged two years, somewhat low proof, it's only 90 proof, 45% by alcohol, alcohol by volume, bottled, distilled and barreled in Montana. Oh, he's not in Montana. Of Matty Kerr. Because I believe he's from Missoula, if I remember correctly. Yes. So, let's start handing these down, Kevin, start handing these down. Now, I'm busting out some glasses, thank you, pass them on down, that Nick and I will assemble real quick. Because, as you know, I know not everyone here drinks like the fishes, Colin and I are.

So I reached in to the Kinda Funny refrigerator and found this bottle of Dom Perignon given to us by one Elon Musk the first time he ever came back to the United States after we started Kinda Funny and he said open this on a special occasion. And I think our one year anniversary is quite that special occasion. We will do the shots first and then we will open this and do that. Did you measure the Amy Gill's Guinness glasses? That is, did you see the mixologist Colin over here? That was like some fucking amazing things. What's that guy from Shovel Knight? Is it Plague Knight? That's one of them.

These, because it gets bigger at the top, this is about a shot and a half. This might be good for like car bombs and stuff like that, but these clearly weren't, you should never do car bombs. Those are huge. But yeah, these are not pure shots. So I poured a real shot first and then wanted to measure it so that two people didn't get the short shrift because, you know, but still we're only drinking something that's like, you know, 90 proof. So it's not terrible. Sure. We can drink like the stag up there that's like 140 proof. That would be good. Do you want a shot of that Tim? What's up? You want a shot of the stag?

I mean, it's one of the things I talk about all the time when I talk to PR people about what we are and what we do. And I'm always talking about the fact that I think honestly, we are only a few months ahead of the curve or whatever. And Guitar Hero Live was definitely one of them where they reached out with that opportunity of like, hey, do you guys want to come do this preview op? And we were like, yeah. And so same thing with that Nintendo thing we went and did, right? And maybe didn't yield the views that Guitar Hero did. But we went there and we were like, hey, cool.

We wrapped up our stuff and then I was like, by the way, did anybody else do that? And they're like, no. I was like, all right. And now, I mean, it's getting to be the point where you see more and more people do it.

We used to, I do think there's going to be times when we want to do more than one in a week and we should do that.

I was at his wedding and he had over, he had a table of like some of our old friends from Northeastern who every time they introduced someone in the wedding party just agreed to all go dog show, which I thought was like the funniest, stupidest thing.

Well, it would be two hours if you want to talk to give me the arugula. Now, Nick, did you wipe card too? All right. Thank you, Nick. Thank you.
