Gears of War for obviously gonna be very excited about the marquee title, that's a flaw game that's developing definitely fall. See you Pheebs, the Rare game. You think we'll see you next year? Probably not, but I don't know that it matters. Yeah, that's just a... it'll happen, yeah. Like a cameo, yeah. I don't, I don't think that it's really going to be super relevant to their to their lineup, not with some of these other gaming crackdowns - Crackdown is gonna huge, I think. I think that will be that will come out that if they were smart they would release that in the summer, I'm like an August game and get out of the way of everything else and let it kind of breathe, that's gonna be a big one.
