I thought we were bros. Oh no no, I was thinking that you were asking for my name, I'm sorry. Oh no, I knew your name. Maybe we should start again. No, we'll leave it in there. This is how Kinda Funny rolls. Sorry guys. We call it GameOverGreggy's garbage truck on fire. No, hey, thank you for coming through. Give me a handshake there. I'm already hugged, don't worry. Everybody knows I'm a hugger. We got the table in the way. You're here to talk about Life Is Strange. Now, if the title and what I just said a second ago, I didn't spoil it for you, this is a spoiler cast. You should only watch this if you've beaten Life Is Strange. This is not going to be like the Steve Gaynor spoiler cast for Gone Home, where an hour and 15 minutes in I spoiled Gone Home. I'm going to spoil Life Is Strange pretty much from the get go.

I interviewed you at E3, you came on the show, Alexa came on the show, this Ashley Johnson, I'd never heard of her before, she's never done anything since came on the show. And we were sitting there talking about Life is Strange, but I told you I've only played episode one at this point. Episode four had just come out. Alexa was shaking me, telling me I had to have played it, but E3 was there and it was too much and I didn't get to play it. I finally sat down and played all of Life is Strange. Just what, Christmas break, right before the new year. And God damn was it good. And I usually I take my, you know, my role in the industry is very small, right?

And I feel like I did you a disservice by not playing it earlier. Oh, thank you so much for that. And no, it's good. It's really cool that you had the chance to play it eventually. And that's great. Thank you. It is great. Life Is Strange, everybody. Now, but here's what I like about Life Is Strange is like right now people are getting another shot to play it. So it came out, it was digital, but now you got this collector's edition coming out. Yeah.

So I'm really happy that there is a new opportunity for new players to discover the game and even for other players to get the hardcover and the soundtrack and stuff like that. It's really cool. So when you, how long have you been working on Life Is Strange? It's been quite a long ride because actually the real production time was around one year and a half. But we started really working on the game. We were a really, really small team of three people when we started to create the concept for the game. And it was a bit more than two years ago, two years and a half ago. So we had almost one year of mostly just conception phase, not full time",

So we are at Dontnod Entertainment, we are an independent studio working with publishers. But we just finished working on Remember Me with Capcom and there were those ideas to maybe make Remember Me 2 or other big projects. And one of the co-founders of the company came to myself and two other coworkers and proposed us to think about a small independent game that we could maybe self-publish as a company. And we had mostly, we could mostly do whatever we wanted to do. The only constraint was to somehow use some of the knowledge we had on Remember Me working with time mechanisms.

So we went standard and we were a bit on our own for one year just working on the, maybe on our love project. And when you're, exactly, when you're working on it and it's just try this indie thing and this love project, did you think it would ever actually come to be? We hoped to because we were really passionate about it. And we, something that's interesting that we didn't, when we were working on it at the beginning, we never thought about targeting audience marketing. We just wanted to tell this story and make the game. We were really, we're passionate about a game that was mostly for us as gamers at first and for creators and for us as creators.

We were really not thinking about that and just thinking about writing this story, making those characters and creating them. Maybe the game of our dreams. I don't know, something like that. That sounds awesome. I mean, like gaming your dreams. Is that how you think of Life is Strange? Right now, I think at this point of my career, yes, I think it's already the project I'm the most proud of having worked on for sure. And so was it the, did the story idea and like you, did you think about like, is it the story idea that comes first or is it the fact that we have this awesome time manipulation mechanic? It's a bit of both. We knew that we wanted to have the time mechanism, but you can use time",

We knew that we wanted to have the time mechanism, but you can use time mechanism in so many different projects. It can be an action game, it can be an adventure game, it could be just only a puzzle game with time, time mechanism. So we already started to brainstorm a lot with that in mind with the two other people. And so there is my co-game director, because we are two directors on the game. The other one is Raoul Barbet and we worked closely also with our French writer Jean-Luc Cano. But you're the only person here because you're the most important. I can say that. You can't say that. I'm kidding. Everybody at home. Don't listen to him. That's not true. Or they will kill me at work if I say that. But yeah, we started to really think about what we could do with this.

I think because we were, you know, in Remember Me, we had the chance to work a lot on the, I was the art director on Remember Me. We worked a lot on the environment. I think we created a really cool universe. But since it was an action game, it was quite fast-paced. You're running through those environments. Yes, you run through. And we had a lot of environmental storytelling, but it was somehow lost with the rhythm. You just, you were rushing the game. So we knew that we wanted to have something where we could maybe take a lot of, where the player could take his time and where we could use this environmental storytelling to really be a part of the story. And so an adventure game, point-and-click adventure game was really a good genre for us to start on",

So there was a lot of different leads. We had some pitch with a male character. We had some pitch with another setting. But I think that the pitch we have right now in Life is Strange was for the strongest because it was really resonating with the time travel mechanism because we have all this kind of nostalgia in the game. The high school setting is for most of the players is in the past for them. So it goes well with the idea of going back in time. And when you're a teenager, we think that it's still a moment of your life when you're making your decisions that will affect a lot of what's how you will be later as an adult.

Yeah, I think we could, everyone of us would want to change things of our teenage years. And yeah, we also are guys in our 30s. So we grew up with American pop culture. There was a lot of influences from that that we really loved like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Veronica Mars, like The X-Files, like Twin Peaks. All of this, somehow we started to create this story. And I think it's really a work of working everything at the same time, story, game design, characters, main themes, and start to build layer by layer everything until you find something that's completely cohesive. Because I think that for me, what's most important in a game is to be sincere about something, to have a strong message, a strong point of view, and try to have everything go into that direction, instead of trying to do a bit of everything.

And yes, starting from that we worked on the secondary characters, we brought Chloe quite early in the writing, but at the beginning, we didn't have Chloe, we only had Max and this high school setting slowly going down into a more darker scene with adult world. But it wasn't completely working. And when we added the character of Chloe, we knew that we had something that was really, really good, because we all fell in love with the relationship between those two girls.

Of how do you relate to a stepfather that isn't your father, that is your real father? Oh, yeah, I think it was a really an awesome time when we were just working on that and finding the bricks to build layer by layer is this story. We talk about the layers and layers of this, though, whenever I talk to a developer, I feel like the thing most say, right, is that by the end, they can't tell if it's good or not.

To be honest, we had doubts every time all along the process because, like you said, you're never sure it will work and never sure it will reach an audience. Even if we were not really thinking about that, we are not sure. We knew that for us, it was interesting. We were talking about stuff and characters and themes that were important for us. But would it work for others? We had no clue at all, to be honest. And I think that it was hard because even when we were talking about the project to even other people in the company, they were really looking at us with big eyes like, okay, you're telling us a story about two girls",

You're telling us that you have those two girls who just won't do a lot of things without a lot of actions and will be talking and talking about their friendship. Are you sure it's interesting? It's hard. I completely understand that on paper it's hard to sell this kind of project because it's quite different. Do you start, I mean, is positive reinforcement coming through playtesting? I mean, is there a moment, like, you know what I mean?

I want to keep playing the game. And they were like, okay, we're onto something. I think that it wasn't that easy for us because we managed to convince people in the company that it was good because after just the pitch of the story, we quickly built the prototype. It was the scene in episode one in Chloe's room where Max and Chloe are seeing each other for the first time and you explore Chloe's room and then you have the drugs, of course, and the scene with David.

He was working on another project. And when he played this prototype, it just came to us after playing and saying that he wanted to work on this with us, that he just loved it. So we knew at this moment that we had something that was working, but it was still a long stretch before showing that to publishers and finding a publisher that would be with us on that. And so then I think, I reached out to people on kindafunny.com slash forums and asked for questions. And one of them came from our friend, Frank Sizemore, the Arctic Sloth.

Were you ever thinking about doing it on your own completely indie? So at the beginning we wanted to go completely indie, but the company was in a difficult time because Remember Me wasn't the success we needed it to be. It was a moderate success, but not enough to... It didn't do the huge numbers. Yeah, it didn't do the huge numbers. It was okay, but it didn't bring more money to the company than what Capcom originally gave us. And Capcom was closing deals with most of these Western companies. So there was no Remember Me 2 on the horizon. So the top management of Dontnod, the CEO told us, okay, we need to sell this project because we cannot do it by ourselves anymore.

I like things called trophies, you know, these PlayStation network trophies and stuff. Is it a new platinum on this?

They don't want to change anything. Thank God. Yeah, that's good. Then what happens? Is the next big milestone episode one comes out? Yes, I think we start to finish working on the production. So prototype was almost the pre-production, but we still needed to reach the level of polish that was wanted for the game.

Probably have a sodded content. It's really not as easy as people think it is. Actually, it's quite harder than making a game in one release. Because it's basically like making five different games with no downtime at all between each game. So you're just finishing one game and you're already working on the next one. There's no chance. There's no milestone where you get to stop and have a celebration. Episode One's out. It's like, no.

For my side, it was really on the creative point of view because we really wanted to explore this way of storytelling using, of course, the knowledge of TV shows. And it's really a different structure. I think that there is a lot of really advantage of doing that for us on a creative point of view. You can really control the pacing because you know that most of the players will play one episode in a go, in one playthrough. So you really know when they start and when they stop. So we can really structure the episode having that in mind. And it also",

In a game that's released as a maybe 20 hours game, a player can stop whenever he wants. And if he stops at a moment of big, slow pacing, he might feel bored and maybe not want to come back. In an episode he created, we knew that the end of each episode, like in TV show, we could have those cliffhangers or crescendo or big moments that would keep the players on their seats and wanting to come back for the next episode. And it also forces us to create the game on a chronological order. Because mostly when you're making a big game, sometimes you are starting by the end. You're not always making the levels in the proper order. And sometimes it ends up with cuts and changes and stuff that doesn't make sense in the",

So is one of the benefits of episodic content that you get to see the comments and you get to see what people are saying about it in the criticisms? There is also that aspect. I think a lot of positive aspects. There is also the fact that there are five releases of the game. So there is a much more media presence because after each episode, you have some reviews, some articles, some marketing from the publisher. So the game grows more and more. Instead of one game where everyone plays it at this release and then it starts to disappear. Sure, you get one big debut, right?

They are screwing us because they want to make more money, which is not the case at all because the game is not made in one go and then we don't cut it in five parts and wait to release them. We are really working during the conception. When episode one is released, we are still working with episode two and etc. The game is not done before. You're not just cutting it up and sitting back watching the checks roll. Exactly.

It's really cool. I've been amazed by the number of discussions, fan arts, theories, fan fictions, cosplays, letters we are receiving almost every day from the fans. It's incredible. So thank you to our community for that. Speaking on their behalf, thank you for making the game. That's the thing about it. When I played episode one, I enjoyed it. I was like, this is cool and it wasn't what I expected. I think that was one of the things about it. It kind of rocked me because jumping into it, I wasn't sure what I was getting into.

Right, exactly. But then coming back to it, I enjoy episodic content. I didn't wait for them to stack up because I wanted to do it all. I wanted to go. I just did it because that's how my schedule shook out. But the relationship you develop with Max, with Chloe and with the family, Joyce, just wanting to hang out and talk to her all the time. By the end of that, I'm dialed into this game every so often. I look on the Reddit and I look on Twitter.

When you finish a movie, you're mostly excited about the stories, about what happened. But it's a bit less about the characters, I think.

The way they handle situations is always different than how I did. I feel like it's almost like it's different from TV shows because TV shows, yes, like when a TV show ends and I'm really into it, right, it is I'm saying goodbye to my friends.

We're the concrete laid between the bricks and we start filling in those gaps and that's where it starts to become that we have ownership over the character, right?

And that's what for us our goal, because the main theme of the story of Life is Strange is really a coming-of-age story where you should learn or see that in order to grow up, to go forward in your life, you need some times to stop looking to the past and to accept the trade-off, to accept a sacrifice and to take a stand, to make a solid decision, be it sacrificing Chloe or sacrificing \n\nNote: I corrected \"coming of age story\" to proper title case (\"coming-of-age story\") as per standard English grammar rules.",

And when you decide to, you accept one of those two decisions, it's when you start to accept that you should concentrate on the future of what will happen next and not try to have this perfect life and changing everything and always try to have a perfect outcome. Because we think that in life there is never a perfect life. It's never black and white like that. Exactly. It's never perfect.

And for us, the destination was the destination we proposed in the game, which might not feel complete for some players, but it's it was really our goal to have this. And one of the critics I read is that people are lacking closure with those two endings. And when I read more of those critics, for example, in the ending, when you're sacrificing the tone and saving Chloe, people say that they would have loved to see what will happen next. What's Max and Chloe will do in a few days. Sure. Who is alive, who is dead. And of course we thought about that.

Because when you make the final choice, you are, you really have to take a position between accepting to sacrifice everything for Chloe or accepting to sacrifice Chloe to save the tone and the other people. And when you're making the decision of thinking that Chloe is what's the most important for you because of all the bonding you had with her. And if you accept to sacrifice everything else, you shouldn't look back. I think that you shouldn't even know what's happening. You know, we could have shown that some people are still alive, that maybe people survive that, but if you start to show that you are reducing the really strong position that Max and the player did by, okay, I want to be with Chloe, everything else",

But in Life is Strange, which is a game about choice and consequences in the game, we never took away. We try to take away the less possible ways, the freedom from the player. And if we start to show what will happen in two months, three months, one year, I think that we are taking the right of the player to create his story by creating it for him.

I don't think I made it on the actual thing, but they were talking about like the Prescott stuff in episode one, didn't come back in full force by episode four. So there was one, one thing that for the Prescott people are talking about that the Prescott knew about the storm, which actually is not true, at least not true in the game.

We should have maybe had six or seven or eight bottles in the junkyard and you should just find five or it was definitely a mistake on our part. And we knew that the players were not happy about it and that it caused some headaches for some of the players. So we, we saw that if Max is in a nightmare, as a player is in a nightmare, we should maybe bring that again.",

I'm like, Oh, this is the photo. And I'm like, I'm not going back. Cause I had done it all without getting caught the first time. And so then when I went back to just the trophy, whore it out and I got caught and then remember that I can rewind time. I was like, I'm such an idiot. I could have been getting every one of these bottles right here. You know what I mean? But in the nightmare, I didn't think to do it. So yeah.

Basically what we did also is in episode four, the scene, if Kate is alive, you can go back in, you go back into the hospital and see Kate. Basically at the beginning, we had cut this scene for budget issues. We, and when we saw that the players were loving Kate so much, we tried to put back the scene and we did put it back. So without the, without the players reaction, we wouldn't have this scene in episode four, which, which, would have been a shame because I love the scene, but, but we saw that it was something that we could cut for, for maybe easing the production.

And if she is then, is she written, I'm going to clean this up. Is she written to be bisexual or is that something decided by the player? If that makes sense. He's saying, and that's what we're talking about where we're totally makes sense. Okay. Basically we, we did write Max as a quite neutral character where every players could put some of his own personality and memories and, and, and soul in, in her. And we did write her as she's questioned. I, of course, I guess that when you're a teenager, you, you have those moments where you, you're questioning yourself.

And yeah, that's the same thing I said before is really, I think that when I, when I look at the player's reaction, I think it worked because I've seen so many players who are completely rooting for Pricefield like Max and Chloe, they will be together. And that's great because that's something that we wanted for them to be able to do with their choice, with the way they're playing, with their relation with Chloe. And on the opposite, if you are not rooting for that, the way you're playing, you can also think that it's only the best friendship ever. Yeah.

We need to have the player have the possibility to do that in one way or the other. Okay. I want to close out with two reader questions. The first one is a three part one. Okay.

And that's something, it's our main concept artist, Edouard Kaplan. He did a lot of those cool posters and t-shirts and he came up with a lot of ideas. He's also the guy who created the Hot Dog Man. And, and yeah, that's a, that's a shirt he made and I just love it. Okay. Number two, what was your or the team's favorite poster out of all the ones scattered around the school grounds? Cause you have, you have posters all over the place. There is so many. I think basically, oh, I might take a long time to answer that. I love environmental storytelling. So for us, it's, Life is Strange, it's a game. So you're playing a game. So there is a need of,\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n- \"prawns\" ( likely referring to the shirt design) \n- \"Josh\" ( likely referring to Josh Shapiro, but in this context, probably just an example name)\n- \"Joe's poster\" ( likely referring to Joe Henson, Life is Strange's co-director)\n- \"Edouard Kaplan\" (corrected from auto-generated error)\n- \"Hot Dog Man\" (corrected from auto-generated error)\n- \"Life is Fun\" \u2192 \"Life is Strange\" (corrected based on video title and context)",

I don't care actually. It's okay. But I think that anyway, since you're controlling your character, controlling the camera and going well everywhere you want, it's a game. You have full control of how you are making the story evolve at your own pacing, et cetera. So we really wanted to have a lot of intricate details in the environment. So you can go, well, that's why there is so many interactions that are not mandatory for the main story, but we really wanted them to, all of them to bring some secondary tertiary layers of narrative to the story.

And so for those posters, I think my favorite one is a creepy one. It's one of the posters in the dark room in episode four. The creepiest place. Great. Okay. I love this place. It's not creepy. I don't know. It's one of the anime posters, which basically I saw that it would feel great within the theme of Jefferson and Nathan. And this is a picture of a girl tearing up her throat with tentacles coming out of her throat. And it was an homage to the Higurashi, a Japanese style of manga with also like Junji Ito, for example.

But I think that in the end, it was something that's perfectly in line with what I wanted to have in the game. And another one, something I love with the posters, we have a lot in the compass in the high school, is that we were able to put a lot of really small details in those. For example, there is one poster for the next game of the Arcadia Bay sport team of the Bigfoot. And it says that one of the next game is the Bigfoot against, the Arcadia Bigfoot against the Sunnydale Razorbacks. And the Razorbacks is the football team in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

You said Square Enix made you make no changes to the game. Did you or anyone from the team actually think Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is one of the best sci-fi films ever made? So yeah, actually someone did. So it's Christian Divine or writer. And so he doesn't say it's the best sci-fi game. He said that is one of the best sci-fi not game movie, one of the best sci-fi movie ever made. So it may be in his top 10 or something, but he really loves it. That was like the one part of that.

Because they felt that maybe people, players would say that it was Square Enix who asked us to put that, but no, they did not ask anything. It was Christian who really wanted to talk about it. And to his defense, I really, I quite enjoyed the Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. I think it's underrated. Okay. I think it's, it has a lot of good points. Maybe I wouldn't put it in my best sci-fi movie list, but I would say that it's better than people are acknowledging it for. Okay. Everyone, give it another watch and let us know.
