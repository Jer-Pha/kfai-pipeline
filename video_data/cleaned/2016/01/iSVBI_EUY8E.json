There are two large reasons for this problem: one being the large number of platforms supported - the solution for each platform is slightly different, I think there's like nine platforms or something - and the other stems from the fact that the engine we're using is no longer being updated, which means adjustments for matchmaking and online code have to be made manually, actually requiring reprogramming parts of the engine by the dev team themselves. Unfortunately, this is all a result of miscalculations on the part of us, the development staff. As a result, our fans who have been looking forward to Mighty No. 9",

We're never talking about Mighty No. 9 on the show ever again until it's out because there's two reasons for that. Number one is I want to remain as objective as possible about this game. I obviously love Inafune, I know him, you know, and I know how hard they work, and uh, I know that everyone knows that Mega Man is my favorite thing. I mean, Inafune is my favorite developer of all time. So it's hard. I'm not mad at him personally.

You can hug Blob too, which is... but uh, you have to use the jelly beans in Your Arsenal to like figure out and get through the environment. So I'll give you an example: so like there's a Jack Jelly Bean, and you give it to him, and he turns into a Jack, then you press X, and he like lifts things up, so you can like walk underneath or uh, there's like a bouncing ball that he can ride, and it lets you like go over water or like bounce a little higher to like reach platforms.

No, I think that it's been interesting so far how they're trickling things out. I think that you can't really draw comparisons to the way The Division has been marketed compared to other triple-A games that came and went. Um, generally simply because The Division was delayed and it's kind of in... I don't want to say hell because I don't think it was, but it disappeared for a while. They clearly removed things from the game, and clearly wasn't meeting some sort of internal expectation of what it was going to be. I think they dialed back the graphics and everything else. Right?

Or it's like really, really good, and they've been sitting on it because they want to make sure it's as good as it can be - which was my assumption, what I hope it's going to be, because the game looks extraordinarily good, yeah, and they're releasing more and more plot details.

It sounds like a really compelling game, so. But I have no expectations for their marketing, and I'm not sure it's going to be an easy game for them to market either because it's dire and it's realistic. This is a game you can't think of marketing the way you would market Fallout: 4, GTA V; this is The Division, it's brand new.

They're obviously super creative and make great games; however, Tearaway on both Vita and PS4 sold poorly. Their upcoming game Dreams looks intriguing but also super weird.

History can be the guide here though I think that cuz I think you're right I think that it's going to be not more about execution than sales because sales are relevant obviously but it's going to be about execution because at least two of the studios Sony's closed uh were closed after they delivered subpar games that didn't sell well, they didn't so Zipper and Bigbig delivered Socom 4 and Little Deviants respectively, both games scored mediocre and were mediocre and sold mediocre and so they disappeared it wasn't like Socom 4 was the **** tour to four Socom",

Um, and obviously, you know, Bigbig was kind of hung out to dry, I think, in a way, but they were closed down. They didn't deliver a game that was like that great, so um, so there's something to be said about like quality because at the end of the day, it's it's the Studio's job to deliver on the product that everyone agreed they were going to make, yep. And that they travel around and see these games often and are playing builds constantly and seeing all those things.
