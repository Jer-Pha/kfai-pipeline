I don't give a **** about it, but I saw the second one, whatever. I look at the turtles, they look like morons; they're awful. It just looks awful; it just looks terrible. Now Rocksteady and Bebop being in it is cool, and they look fine. It's just it's like C - it's like a CG someone took a CG jizz over the screen, and that's totally fine. But I did like obviously Megan Fox, but also I liked uh Casey Jones, who's like by far my favorite character in Turtles like by a mile, and uh so it's cool to see him in there, and and it's his like what they show of him I like.

There's a moment where they're about to go up in an elevator and they have this stupid back-and-forth, and I laughed and I'm like, \"You know what?

This hurts every time you guys say that - a part of Colin dies. What hurts the most about it is that a long time ago, Jim Ryan and I were waiting for a train to IGN outside of this before phones did video or whatever, and there was a pigeon who was eating a slice of pizza and flipped it over his head onto his back. If we could have been filming that moment, lives would be completely different right now - it would've been viral as heck. There was also the Toronto raccoon. I don't know that guy.
