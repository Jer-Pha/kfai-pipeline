And I feel like with Geoff is the same way - Geoff's that guy for that group where he makes fun of the sponsorship. So him doing it, it's kind of the joke again misses the mark when most people don't get that reference. But at the same time, it had to happen for this thing to happen on the scale that it did. And unfortunately, a lot of it comes down to all right, well they needed money to get celebrities to do this thing. But we don't want celebrities; we want to see Awards; we want this whatever the problem is. They don't care what you want; they care what the majority of people want; they care about growing this thing. They have their obvious business ramifications that they need to consider, but they also have goals.",

And I think that The Game Awards has filled a void of the late year E3. It's that second thing we got PSX, but where else are we going to see all the other guys have stuff you know Nintendo for years has been debuting things there, whether it's like Cranky Kong's playable in Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze or things of substance like uh Zelda: Breath of the Wild before we knew was breath of the wild being shown for the first time.
