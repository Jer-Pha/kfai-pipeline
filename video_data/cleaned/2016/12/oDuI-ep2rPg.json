There are a few that you can make a case for. I think everyone would make the case for Panzer Dragoon Saga. Yep. I agree. Um yeah, I I mean I people adored that game. Was also super hard to find as people might remember. Very underprinted, very rare game and not enough Unreal games like that. Like Star Fox, I love it. I I think Star Fox to me is better just because of the characters and **** but Panzer Dragoon is a better game. What else? Well, you had a Saturn, Greg, so what did you mean? Nights into Dreams.

That's a tougher sell it feels like on everything. I would I would just at least a shout out to Bomberman on on Saturn. Sure. for the multiplayer alone. Best Saturn game, but it's Yeah, like Virtual Cop on here. It's like I remember playing that and enjoying it, but I mean, I don't need to put it up there. People love Radiant Silvergun. I don't have enough experience with it. And Shining Force III. Yeah, that's the one. Um, can you go over to the right? Colin said, \"Can you go over to the right?\" You're welcome, Kevin.

Although it was because I just needed something to play on. There's things about them, aspects about them that are cool. Escape from the City and the snowboarding and uh Sonic Adventure 2 is great, but I mean it's not that great. Jet Set Radio Future Soulcalibur now. Yeah. Gamecube. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Okay.

The Wii U, I don't think it was. That's true. So, they didn't feel they were both middle consoles that that led to part of the problem. But, shout out also to NBA 2K and NBA 2K1. Those were both great games. Yeah, amazing games. I personally couldn't stand by it because of NBA Street Volume 2 and also well yes there are better games on PS2 and another I mean NBA 2K17 but the uh but also the online component of it was what really made those games tick and obviously you can't do that anymore cuz I really was flabbergasted playing those games online in like 2000 I was like this is unbelievable keyboard plugged in like this is insane like I don't understand how",

You want to put both on there? I think so. Okay. If I had to choose, I would cut Rock Band. You would cut Rock? You're crazy.
