I think it's great. Uh, I think that there are a lot of technical issues. I actually had a back and forth today with the CEO of Telltale on Twitter, where he was asking about what the problems were, and I told him, and then I, I reflected after that, I'm like, you know, guys, I really hope you figure out these problems out, like your narrative and your storytelling and your characters deserve a better engine. And frankly, um, just to get the negative out of the way, uh, Batman is another engineering failure, um, on Telltale's part, and uh, especially the fifth episode, um, I I want to go through this, like actually what we saw in episode 5 that like outside of this we talked about on Conor Greg live, I had the little hitches, like The Telltale hitch I always call it, where you're about to transition scenes in the other episodes I was like all",

And uh there are no more excuses these games are not technological behemoths they are not doing anything interesting or unique from a technical standpoint the game should be able to run especially on these new machines and so just getting the negative out of the way, they need to fix that as inexcusable. Well what's crazy about it is the fact that we're all seeing the same how many how similar they are and how different they are so I didn't have the slowdown and I had seen people bitching about that when I was getting ready to launch I was like **** I didn't get it and I was like oh great it's not a widespread problem then",

Like how many times we need to hear the same story? My biggest complaint against Arkham Knight spoilers is that right, it's just all right. This is just the Jason Todd story again; this is you know Red Hood, why did they make a big deal like this is going to be original when it isn't original at all?

Where any moment where you're walking around a scene or identifying things, I'm like, \"I don't need to see or do any of this.\" Just show me; make it more of a pure adventure game where I'm making decisions, the things are going, and I'm selecting things on screen. But you don't have to. Like, I feel like they throw this **** in because they feel like they have to. And I don't think it adds anything to the game; actually, I think it detracts from the game. I think the most exciting parts of the game are when you're... like the first episode's a great example: when uh Bruce Wayne's at you know with Harvey at the at some sort of al fresco and it's just a long time of just making decisions, walking around; you're not controlling anything; you're just making decisions.",

That's when Joker puts that toxin out and they all go crazy. Duke's family goes, he then becomes one of the Robin kids, and now he's the guy in All-Star Batman running around in the black and gold suit or whatever, and like just the way that he saves him reminds me so much of the way he saves every one of the Robins or whatever - it'd be awesome to see him introduced not as Robin but as the All-Star Batman, you know, a different thing. Here's what I thought: I'm not knowing anything about this Duke character; I was like, \"I assume that's going to be Robin,\" yeah, and I would love to see that and have them continue to just branch off and do their own world and do whatever they want with it and all these different things. It was cool too, like uh, it was weird when in that Veil family crime scene episode 4 when she chokes",

Is probably the best way to phrase that. Otherwise be like, \"I want to do,\" and shout out... and like that's another thing about it is I that was a surprising moment for me where I was like, \"I want to watch,\" and I expected them to slow down. They do the fade back, and it's like, \"No, here I'm unzipping.\" And you don't see like nips or anything, but I was like, \"Damn.\" Like this is actually again an adult Batman story right? Like EP, it's the same thing in episode one when like a guy's been shot in the head or whatever, and he comes in and like uses that thing to like suck the bullet out. And like... and then you impale Falcone if you want at the end on the rebar, and it's like, \"Or\" you break the guy's arm. And he was like, \"This is actually a very mature Batman.\" You know.",
