And I think that's a failure on that level as well. And as I said before, it's a failure on media's level, uh, the way the media hypes up games um is sad to me. And this is a good example of we're allowed to be excited about games right and sometimes it doesn't pan out. Mafia III is a great example. I was super excited about Mafia III and I was actually positive it was going to be good. Um, and I think the narrative was good and I think it was an interesting story and a very dynamic story but but the game wasn't very good; it was super boring. And that's why after 25 hours I just like I can't play this anymore. I just I'm not interested in this game um so we all have we're all complicit in that in a way, but the way the media and as I've",

Obviously, you can't talk about those things without mentioning Nintendo. I feel like the last couple of years have been really rough for them, and I'm happy that in the last few months they've done nothing but made great calls, great decisions - the Switch, the marketing seems amazing, everything with Super Mario Run. Uh, the internet stuff we'll see, like by the time this posts, people are probably playing it already.

I mean yeah, and the writing was on the wall before the game got even remotely yeah, it's there was a lot of issues with that, and then other things like and this is more recent but it it still is in what I was talking about the trend of them switching over in that weird place from Wii U 3DS over to Switch. Things like Super Mario Maker 3DS - awesome game I've been playing the hell out of it the last couple weeks, and it's great, but it's super limited, and why can't I download levels that I'm specifically looking for um from the internet and like made in the Wii U version, and it's it seems super backwards, and it's an obvious hey there's going to be a Switch version and it's going to be definitive, and like that's again insulting\"",
