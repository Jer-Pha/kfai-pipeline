Well, you guys all know Stu at this point. I know of him in this. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Yeah. Good friend Stu and his wife. And we were talking about just the difference in generations. Um, and it reminded me of a topic that I that we have talked about before in the show. Um, the singularity, right? We were talking about how people are glued to their phones. And she was arguing that there will be eventually a point where things bounce back. Um, where people kind of revolt against that, which I always feel like is the idealistic way of looking at things. But the reality is, and this is what I was trying to tell her, I was like, we are headed toward that convergent point of, you know, when they're going to be able to put chips in our brains, uh, to regulate hormones, to regulate different things, to regulate dysfunctions, to",

Um, and then I randomly read an article on Wired where a guy was trying to hack his own brain, like went down to BISCUIT to to um have a brain surgeon put like wires and copper wiring and stuff in his brain and like totally messed him up for a little while, but I guess he's I guess he's okay. For a little while. Yeah. I mean, like, well, he bounced back. They were like he he was having He just restarted the system. Well, he was having problems. Hit it a couple times.

Eventually, it came back to him as the brain as the swelling went down, he was able to get it back. But for instance, he would say like, \"Hey, I have this pencil.\" And you'd be like, \"That's a pen.\" And he'd be like, \"Yes, pencil.\" You know, like **** like that where he would just say, \"Sorry, sorry, sorry.\" Because he couldn't form sentences. You'd ask him a question, he'd be like, \"Uh.\" But but that's that's literally that's in the article. But what's fascinating about this is it's all going towards something, right? Eventually they will figure it out. And they they they talked about um the uh Colin Moriarty, I think you read the story, the science, the guy that there's a neuroscientist that did it to a bull and was able to actually have the bull stop and like turn around.",

And then there was another story of uh how you can do it to cockroaches where you can actually like tap and like put electrodes on cockroaches and actually steer them. It's that's crazy, right? So my question to you guys is we all know what's coming. Would you in your lifetime consider doing this? You wait for the S version. You wait for the S version. You wait till Apple does it and then you do it. I wouldn't do Yeah, I wouldn't do Gen One, but I would I would totally be open to it. I'd want to. We're going to I mean the reality is, you know, this goes what Ray Kurzweil talks about a lot and people should read his stuff because he's he's a futurist and futurism is like is is fascinating stuff to re read about because it's it's the idea of it's not a it's not a it's not supposed to be science",

And it's supposed to be like what do we really think is going to happen, right? And so these guys like look at this and I think Ray Kurzweil thinks the singularity is in 2045. I think it might even be sooner than that. I think he might even um I think it'd be as soon as the 2020s. Um you think so? Yeah. But but not in the form of like man merges machine and then Skynet happens, right? You're talking because that's not what that is. Like Skynet's AI. So like that's that's that's different and AI is dangerous and like that these are things that um you know AI is something that even like Bill Gates is starting to talk about being like and Stephen Hawking and and and um you know a lot of these kind of you know phenomenal technological minds are being like we should really be careful what",

Um but that's different theoretically and technically than the singularity. The singularity is the idea of becoming a cyborg, of which I love that name - I love the term cyborg because it's so 80s and you're like that's never going to happen and eventually we're all going to be cyborgs. It's the literal merging of technology in a substantial way. So I think that these things are going to start happening like in the 2020s. Um I think that like you'll start people are going to start having kind of heads up displays and stuff like that. Um do you think they're going to actually be implemented into their eyes or will it I mean obviously it'll start with I mean that's that's the thing that comes down to me, right? Is there",

But when you start saying, \"Hey, they're going to put lenses into your eye that never have to leave, right?\" Well, they're already doing that, right? Like you can go get permanent lenses fixed to your eyes now if you have problems. Like that stuff exists unless I'm I think I'm I mean I just found out this week that there's contacts that you can leave in all month. Yeah. I didn't know that.

It's the gradualness of it and that's what's terrifying to me is that like I thought I mean I'm I'm a late adopter of everything. You know that I still have an iPhone 5S and it's still rocking. The new update works wonders for it. But like the newer generation is going to be like cool a chip that I put in my brain. I don't need a cell phone anymore. I can just be like Snapchat people and you know this is this is the thing is that there's going to be I don't agree that it's going to be gradual.

Yeah. But think about it this way. Like we've talked about Moore's Law, I think it's called, and stuff like that. The idea that I think every 18 months the processing power multiplies by two, right? This has been true for decades. It's incredible. Um, and we've talked about in the past, but like 10 years ago, the most primitive version of this phone you didn't even know would exist, right? Yeah.

And uh I was gonna say iPhone, but everyone just Uber, for instance, changes the way we interact with a sharing economy, right? And um really came up with one of the ones that come up with the idea of the autonomous vehicle. The autonomous vehicle was something we were hypothetically talking about two years ago. They're like really close now to that. Like there's it's only a couple years away from Apple probably revealing Project Titan and these other companies driverless comes to you and picks you up and you're like in 10 years I was just listening to on NPR about this in 10 years like they're like these things are going to be everywhere now like a year ago we didn't even think about it as more than a hypothetical and they're like in 10 years you",

You know what I mean? Which which is literally probably 1 billion times more powerful than the Apple I, right? You know, it didn't take that long. Like, this thing is smaller and more compact and more useful and more ubiquitous. It has more utility than anything we could have ever imagined. 15 years ago, no one had any idea that this was going to happen. And so, all I'm trying to say is that, and by the way, we had cell phones 15 years ago, 20 or 25 years ago, but no one knew it was going to turn into this. We all thought we were stuck with those little tiny keys on the back. What it requires, what this hall requires, what",

That was what Steve Jobs was. You know, that's what um Elon Musk is. These guys have vision. And that's a really rare thing to have because this technology here, the ability to do what we want to do, the ability to go to Mars, for instance, is possible. We can do we could have done it 40 years ago. Mhm. It's going to take someone to be like, \"Well, maybe we maybe it should be a suicide mission.\" Like someone to just like cross the gap and be like, \"Well, how do we actually make it happen?

Go people should go read about the Xerox Alto and the Xerox Star. These computers in the 70s were what the Macintosh would be 10 years later, but they had no idea what to do with it. It takes like someone with vision to say like, \"Oh, a mouse.\" Like you don't have to use keys. Like you use your hand on a track ball and it clicks on things. And these guys like, \"Yeah, we invented this 10 years ago.\" Mhm. And he's like, \"All right. Well, they like like we're going to like I see what this actually is, right?\" He was the one that said, \"I'm going to take this and go and and and pair it with a user interface that works for it and put it in living rooms.\" Right?

That's just something that and that's something that I wish I had more of. Obviously, everyone wants to be more like Steve Jobs, but like I I can't draw those parallels, right? Like that's why I'm such a late adapter for everything where I'm like, um, you I look at these things and I'm like, I just don't need this. I don't need the next generation of it. And you're holding up an iPhone 5. I mean, to be fair, Tim's is the most powerful at the table, right? Sure. Kevin would argue that his many times more powerful. That's when it turns on. The thing is, at Xerox PARC, people should read about Xerox PARC. Um, uh, Paul Allen, it's called PC, Paul Alto Research Center. Really remarkable place in the 60s and 70s what they were doing.

Like they and like the guys that were getting really frustrated, a lot of those guys ended up going to Apple, getting poached to make the Macintosh and the Lisa, which is, you know, another computer people read about. Like the the the point is that this technology is like latently sitting around a lot of times and it just takes someone with a little bit of vision to say like what can we do with this and that that's why that I'm bringing it back to you know more cyborg technology or chips like we're not going to you know we are going to meld one day with machines.

No, I mean, we're bigger and smarter, but that's basically it. The thing is that the point I was bringing up is that like cavemen in the Stone Age or whatever had a focus on survival, right?

They didn't have time to think. They died quickly. The next group of people came, they died quickly and so on and so forth. And then with like animal husbandry and with agriculture and all that kind of stuff, people started to be like, well, we can raise cattle and like plant wheat and do all these kinds of things and outsmarted the system for the first time really.
