Yes, people have always wanted us to do more tabletop board game stuff here we are. So we're doing it. Our boys over at Cyanide & Happiness are making a card game called Joking Hazard. Right now it's in Kickstarter. Yeah, they need your help. It's... you know, oh they're struggling. They're goal is $10,000. The goal for them is $10,000. There's a link that you can see there. There's also a link to click in the description for you to go support if you want the game you can buy it there. Their goal is $10,000. They are currently at $1,597. So why do this let's play? Why even help them? Because that's a testament to how many people want this game. And that's the thing when you said hey we're going to do this let's play about Cyanide & Happiness I said I don't know who that is. You said yeah, you do and you showed me the cartoon I was like\"",

I'm looking at him spoiling it as always, want I got get Nick for ruining another game. We're going to play together as friends. I'm going to take this mic. What are you going to do with a tough guy and swallow it? No, you're going to listen to my stomach because I die. Here are the rules: all right. The game Joking Hazard is a party game for drunk and boring people alike where four or more players compete. Get me a beer to finish a three-player, a three-panel comic. Now we're playing with three - um, I don't know if that's going to affect this but we're not drunk. Yeah, but we're boring. I'm gonna get drunk. Yeah, um... Set up one: every player starts with seven cards visible only to them; two, the rest of the cards remain face down.\"",

I want to be the first judge. Nick will be the first judge. So I get to pick between who's funnier - that's what I'm doing. I don't know; we'll find out. Schon's on your mic. I got it all fast. How to play: One, the deck plays first. The judge flips the top card of the draw pile blindly and plays it on the table face up. Okay, if it's a red card, read ahead to rule number five. So the deck plays first. So okay, go for it. The judge - this is the deck. Okay, these are uh B beta cards, yeah. Right now this isn't how the game is going to be.

Here's my other point of feedback for you guys: I I don't know if you're going to have enough money to do this but maybe um like making the cards slightly more slippery with like a gloss or a semi-gloss would be nice um really anything that's more than - don't look I dropped one okay, the judge, the deck plays for also the presentation of this box well I'm actually liking it's like snake skin.",
