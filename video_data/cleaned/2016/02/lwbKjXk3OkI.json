Now I didn't have a topic today going in so I was thinking I was like, \"What do I want to talk about?\" I was like, \"I don't know.\" I was looking on Facebook scrolling through some stuff and all of a sudden it hit me how much I want to be sleeping right now. I'm like, \"That should be my topic,\" and you said this applied to your hair somehow. Yeah, I really like sleep. I like sleep, you know? You guys know me; you all know me. There's a couple things Tim Gettys likes: I like soda, yeah, I like Coke. I like eating out in all senses of the word, a Jesus God! Um, I like that's pretty much it and I like sleep. All right, so here's my topic about Nintendo; you're N, I like Pok\u00e9mon. I like I like a lot of stuff right but I really like sleep, and I think sleep kind of overcomes everything. Really, like I enjoy food; hunger is definitely an emotion to me, okay? Just you know I need to feed it; it's hunger, yeah. Um, but when",

Um, but when it comes to sleep, it's like I could sleep forever, you know? There are people that are like, \"You sleep too much, you're just too tired.\" No, I mean maybe, yeah, I guess that's true, but I think that's just exciting because I get to sleep sooner right, you know? And I could always sleep instead of doing whatever I'm doing at that moment, okay. There are a lot of things I like to do, but it's like my perfect vacation, I've said this before, is to just sleep forever: wake up, eat with Kevin, eat out with Kevin, and then go back to sleep. Now what's weird to me is the fact that I have trouble sleeping; I don't sleep well, oh really? Yeah, I wake up a lot, and it takes a lot for me to fall asleep.

It's cuz I'm always in my head, I'm always thinking about stuff, scheming **** and doing all that. But I just you know the older I get the more I realize how much I just appreciate sleep and how much it just makes everything better. And the hair thing is because you know getting my hair done is a is a process man like it's worth it most of the time but then it's that 15 minutes or like 20 minutes of shower and hair and all that I'm like I could be sleeping man. And is that 20 minutes of sleep worth everything? No, it never is. But it feels real good, but it feels **** good.

I don't I don't know any of the signs behind it, I just know that I **** no, no one's been able to figure out sleep. Yeah, some say we we never sleep, we just go to another dimension of Blackness. I haven't heard that, but I'm just letting you know that's something Kevin and I have been kicking around in our off time. You guys aren't here, we're doing experiments. I like his socks a lot, swinging into the frame, Kev show that American FL and I'm proud to be uh sleep for me is a means to an end, I wish I could, I wish I didn't have to sleep, 'cause like I always have more to do there's always more things to do and like I'm playing a game usually at night you know what I mean?

I can't just sleep in like Kevin can just sleep anywhere - like he'll just lay on the floor and just fall asleep, like not even laying down, it'll be sitting on the floor, that yeah you have or like Sean Finnigan's another guy like that.

I liked doing that; it made me feel like I could get more things done because there's fewer distractions. But um, I rarely get eight or nine hours of sleep at a time.
