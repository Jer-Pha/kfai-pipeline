And it would mean the world to me if you went and voted for me, of course. Every time we win one of these things, it's a win for Kinda Funny, and it's a win for you because we get to go there and be like, 'Hey, people who've never heard of us - guess what? People like us!' And maybe I want to be your best friend, or they're jerks, and they say, 'We'll stay away forever.' So if you go to KindaFunny.com/SXSW and vote for Greg Miller for most entertaining online personality, I would take it as a personal favor that I will never ever be able to repay. What's up everybody? Welcome to the GameOverGreggy Show. I am one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside our producer slash seducer Nick Scarpino. Colin, if you grab that thing any harder, you're not getting into heaven. Did you ever find your high glass cleaner? No, I didn't. Well, you told me when I asked.\"",

I mean granted Ellen's not a kid, but at the same time, like we eight people a Palin all the time, you don't see them going after it right? How many people are doing lip sync videos right now online right? Like how many people are getting bashed for that stuff? That's just the nature of how this goes. Like it's not it's it's a little bit insidious to go after people who are inspired by your idea, they want to do it there, we're not going after them like the Fine Bros. did.",

And so again, this is where all the fear comes in because no one wants to go through that and people are scared that the content that they're doing, that might be paying some of their bills, the big bad Fine Brothers are gonna come take that away from them. But that's the problem of what's happening right now is they didn't say any of that - that's not there in ten. Their intent and I believe this was simply to say we have an awesome brand if you want to be a part of this awesome brand, you can now. This is the way to do it. And from that regard, I think it's really, really sad what happened to them. Simply because that is a - that is a crazy kind of cutting-edge idea on YouTube at least in the TV world that's been happening all the time like you know Andy Cohen starts",

So it's like that just sucks, man, like it just sucks. They just need to be there; they're just taking such a hit, just like this whole thing that we planned out. We're just not doing it all; I'm just gonna keep going. We're not gonna trademark this thing that we could totally have gotten the trademark for, and we're just gonna just keep going.

Why encourage people to keep that in mind because it's not easy like that seeing those guys worn beaten faces in the second video alone even though I didn't agree with so many things they were saying I thought they were backtracking and kind of changing their story a little bit at least that's what it sounded like, that is my opinion still.
