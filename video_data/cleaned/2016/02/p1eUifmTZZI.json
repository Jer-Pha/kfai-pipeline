It's so cute. We call this sporty in a little fat car. So fat drive and this car was so underpowered that it couldn't make it up one of the bigger hills in Riverside that I had to get home.

I know you're stressed and it's not a big deal.\" He's like, \"I just want you to do know this though,\" in the middle of your rant and rave, you did call me and Kevin **** Yeah.
