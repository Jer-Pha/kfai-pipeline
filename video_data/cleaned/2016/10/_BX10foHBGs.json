Yeah, it's going to be interesting and here's the thing it's going to be interesting to see where they go right because we had a cool twist right at the beginning uh which is not not revolutionary but it was like you're like oh they're going to **** with us a little bit like we're not we're not sure what's happening um 10, 10 episodes, more am I so excited and then we sort of are on this story line that's",

You think so? I would agree with that. I think because the maze gets referenced, I think when - and I could be wrong on this - when they were talking to Dolores right or whatever, it seems like the maze is for hosts. And I don't know if that's in the last episode they made it seem that way. If the maze is a like a test to be like, if you can get through this thing then you are... yeah, you found conscious.

Sure, sure, and he's just like, \"I know it's not for me,\" but I'm going to do this so that the completionist guy is satisfied. Yeah, cuz that's the thing of like too where it's like he went and you know takes the guy's scalp to get the the Maze map or whatever right. But it was interesting when they're cutting back and forth to Evan Rachel Wood in the barn; he goes to scalp her too. It's I don't think the map was on every person right, like he's been going through systematically trying to figure out who has this, and it turns out that there is another game.\n\nI corrected phonetic mistakes (e.g., \"fandy\" to \"Evan Rachel Wood\"), spelling errors (none found), and capitalized proper nouns (e.g., \"Ed Harris\", \"Evan Rachel Wood\").

Well, that's the other thing too is like people clearly know he's on this TR doing playing this game right because at some point something told that little girl to tell him more than was right or that it wasn't for him whatever it wasn't for him what it was she's like go to the the whatever and go but it's not meant for you. But it's not meant for you, right? I mean so she shut off and then came back to herself. So someone that was that just be a program that was already set in there.

I'll look it up after this. No, that's what I'm saying - that's why I think there's got to be something. The Man in Black is got to be something. So but I mean ultimately like this is obviously based on I think it was Michael Crichton's movie not a book; I think he wrote a movie and it was called Westworld, I think it was Yul Brynner, but the concept was originally and that it was a bunch of reporters coming to this brand new theme park - it was Jurassic Park basically. Yeah, bunch of reporters coming to this brand new theme park with all these robots; then lowy hold one of the robots, they all start going crazy and killing all the humans, and so that's that's the general theme that we're dealing with.",

Does he just stay there every day in the same outfit getting sticky and nasty and finishing off the I mean that's another one of those questions of just like how are they getting these robots in and out? Like well I mean interesting. I understand how they're getting them out with the elevator, but I mean like how are you like are new people coming in every day and if so how? If I just shot James Marsden's character is he there interacting with the lore the same way? You know what I mean like is that we're all it doesn't make sense that the story is reset every day right, but that doesn't make any sense then because there's people who are staying multiple days even the guy right now with his brother-in-law on an overarching quest and everything.",

It's like in-game: if you were to go and some events have been triggered, you can't do that side quest anymore until you come back the next day. What do you think? I understand what you're saying - when the two uh... cuz I mean, I'm sorry, just I'm sor- but what happens then when I take James Marsden out on the trail with me and we're gone for like people can't use him anymore? Yeah, so the quest changes a little bit. But you just said that it starts anew every day right? But so if you take James Marsen out - that day and that's the day that's the only day I'm there, I don't get to do that Quest because someone else took him there's only one of him.

Just I don't know, I don't want to see everybody oh hey, I just **** shot you or I couldn't save you yesterday and your whole family was killed by the Man in Black murderers or whatever.
