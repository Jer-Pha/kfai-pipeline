Tim, yeah what's your topic? Um my topic I mentioned earlier it's Kazaa and Napster and LimeWire and all of these peer-to-peer uh networks that we used to use um I was thinking about this because I came across a screenshot for LimeWire and it instantly just gave me all these flashbacks of downloading all types of stuff and that was you know I started with Napster moved on to Kazaa eventually LimeWire eventually FrostWire then eventually Torrents. Give me Timel, give me a timeline here.

So, I'm more comfortable paying for this kind of stuff, and it seems like Torren has taken that over - I don't have any experience with that world at all; going to the Pirate Bay or whatever people do, I don't know how to even do it.

So once it made that shift to torrenting, which was probably around 2005, I would say is when it like really started. Half-Life 2 came out in '04 and that was huge; that was like the torrent exactly. And there, there's a whole bunch of uh, I mean LimeWire and FrostWire and SoulSeek and all this stuff they still existed, like I mean they still to this day exist or at least Soulseek does.

Um, but you have to kind of segment that and separate it from the reality of the 12-year-old or all this kind of stuff, and whether you can justify it or find some moral high ground or whatever in there, I don't know. But like, I don't think it's not really it seems like a dead issue to me because what really what really nullified it, like I said, was was ultimately Pandora, and then especially Spotify, but actually YouTube was really what nullified it for me in college, like people are just uploading everything to there every album, yeah, and I was just like fine that's fine you know, like I'll",

It's like if you had to go look for it, then that's... And that's what happened. That's exactly right. And so I like that there are solutions, like Apple's Ingenuity, which started with the iMac for some, or renewed Ingenuity, which started with the iPod for some. But I think it started with iTunes, and like, the iPod came out first, and when iTunes hit, I'm like, 'Yeah, you guys understand.' And then they changed the marketplace forever, and that's still the way the market exists to this day, which I think is remarkable. And once they make it easier... and so it's all about ease, and then extracting money in ways that you don't even think about. I was just looking at my bank statement today, and it's like $8.99 for Showtime, and I'm like, 'I have no idea where the **** I even signed up for Showtime,' but all right.\"",

And I'm too lazy to figure out where the hell I go to even cancel it, so I guess you're going to just extract so I can watch The Circus every week, you know what I mean? So it's like, yeah, probably, but it's it's so it's it you know. And so Spotify is the same way, but often said that I think that Spotify um is worth more and I think they're eventually going to have to charge more as well. They also need to give their artists a lot more money than they are. Well, that's what I'm saying - like I would gladly if there were some sort of Premium premium premium thing, I don't even know what it would look like because there's really just a premium account um that you pay $10 or whatever it is for. If they were like, \"You get all this ****\" for $50 a month, and then you get all of this, I'd be like, \"That's fine.\"",
