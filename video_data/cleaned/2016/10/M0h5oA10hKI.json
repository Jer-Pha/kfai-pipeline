We liked why it didn't make sense only because gun making sense and here we are in Battlezone. Anything can happen back then, but it's I what I like about I mean this is why VR works and is so different right - the fact that there is depth of field. Right, like when I kill this guy, I got to look down at my little radar that's in my tank and actually understand where I'm going. And granted, like that, you know having a tank HUD like that made sense, but it feels like it's right there - you know what I mean? Like I feel like I should see my hand as I reach out to touch it. Oh man, tell you what, I can't wait for the Batman Arkham tank combat just kidding, I don't want to be in that crap ever again. Damn son shots fire. What's interesting about Battlezone and why I think it's going to get so much press at launch and like that.\"",
