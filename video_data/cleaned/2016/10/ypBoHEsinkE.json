I think that Mafia III's presentation in terms of its story, its voice acting, its characters and character development - I think it's fantastic. I think that they really nailed that. I think there's a lot of compelling characters. For those who don't know, it does take place in the same world as Mafia II. Vito Scaletta is actually one of your associates in Mafia III. The game takes place in 1968 and a place called New Bordeaux, which is a fictional version of New Orleans. And it's you play as a black man named Lincoln Clay. That's important because the Deep South is incredibly racist, especially in the 1960s. He comes back from Vietnam; he's a decorated soldier. He's also a special ops kind of guy, so he has a lot of special training and stuff like that.\"",

He comes back; he has an adopted kind of family that took him in when he was younger. Push comes to shove, it's very early in the game, and I want to spoil it for anyone who doesn't want any spoilers, you can go away for 15 seconds, don't bother just go away for the next 15 seconds - but the very close to being of the game his family is killed by the mob, and he has to basically go out on a revenge tour, basically to seize at the assets of this particular mobster through all of his lieutenants and kapos, and then work his way up to the top. So the whole foundation of it's great; it's just that everything else isn't great, and the game is a little half-baked, with a lot of technical problems - what are some of the technical issues you're running into?

Nothing too weird in terms of like gameplay things that you wouldn't expect, but necessarily not world-ending no, I mean the game crashed probably four or five times. I mean, like, just crash in the middle of whatever, and I have to restart from wherever you know the last checkpoint. That's one thing. There are severe and significant lighting issues in the game. I've never seen it - I've never seen anything like it in my life. Actually, I played this for a couple hours with two guys, yeah, I played many video games. The lighting is all messed up in this game, and some people are saying that they're not having problems to that - I don't know.",

The idea is really cool because you're basically doing monetary damage to their take, which is an interesting thing - the rackets are controlled so that there's a take of $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, whatever it is. So you're going around like murdering people or like stealing money or like destroying trucks and like ammo and all these kinds of things. And every time you do a little spin thing, something's gonna happen in the corner saying like you've removed this much more money out of their pockets and this much more money in other pockets. You get it down to zero then you can attack the racket, and it's a nice idea except for the fact that like you just do the same thing over and over and over and over again - it is just so",

With a story that's good, and a voice acting cast is good, and a plot kind of idea and setting this good, the gameplay must serve the story but it doesn't, it's basically a distraction. I'm playing through the game just to get to the story instead of playing the game because I want to play the game, and I play it very meticulously where I'm finding all the collectibles and the Playboy magazines and the and the Vargas paintings and and all these little switches and stuff like that that you used to take over call boxes basically as a whole mechanic there but it just it just comes",

So yeah, man, we were talking about New Year's Doom but that's a release date for Doom, and it released, and they didn't get CoD until the game came out or like where should we worried about it and end up doing it ended up being the Doom was one of the best games of the year.

Thought I know how they were looking forward we're looking at this being like this is gonna die Grand Theft Auto, but it's certainly not even in the same league as Grand Theft Auto in terms of mobile world games.
