Did you think it was going to last? How many episodes were we going to do in your head? I don't know, like just the ones we filmed the first day basically. Uh, no. I remember you came back from VidCon last year, the YouTube convention, right, and you had this great idea apparently weren't you driving in a van is that true?

Well, again, like you, I always think you're like, 'Oh yeah, I've only known one of the topics.' The other day you're like, 'It's surprising that I haven't been stumped at one of these conversations.' It's like, well, no ****, I'm P pulling topics that I know you have an opinion on. It's rare that I'm not like, every topic I get is just a pile to see what he has to say about shoelaces - I might or might not have something to say about botany or shoelaces, I don't know.

We, you know, Girl Meets World, Girl Meets World, great. Cats versus dogs, cats versus dogs. Yeah, so I can't believe there's still things to talk about but apparently there are more and they're getting better. I'm really excited. This is the first conversation of the day today, for so we have many left to go. Spoilers: we filmed them all in one day; some of you started putting it together also yes.

Thank you all so much for your support. Remember we do these all the time if you enjoyed this like and favorite the video subscribe to the channel and we'll have a new topic every Tuesday and Thursday until then have a conversational day. A number cruncher, I got an abacus yeah I'm not going to be that guy, not going to use an abacus at work every day, not going to sit there in front of the Excel spreadsheet and add up you know how much corporate loss we have and what the net gain is. I don't even know what business term a lot of business terms just throw out terms. What's the vend diagram intersect this parallel course? Um, you sound like someone that has a business background.\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n* \"comic gorons\" to \"Comic Gorons\" (assuming it's a reference to a comic or a character)\n* \"Batman's a quarter of the way there so just keep watching him just watch him over and over over\" to remove unnecessary repetition\n* \"Freddy fingers\" to \"Freddy Fingers\" (assuming it's a reference to a person or a character, possibly a play on Freddy Krueger)\n* \"Col I think that is about wraps up this conversation\" to maintain the original sentence structure and grammar\n* \"business ter\" to \"business terms\"\n* \"vend diagram\" to \"venture diagram\" (assuming it's a reference to a business concept or term, possibly a play on words with \"venture\")\n* \"parall course\" to \"parallel course\"",
