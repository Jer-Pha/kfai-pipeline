The turning point in the movie is when Adam Banks joins the team. He's a turncoat and Adam Banks basically is a Hawk. He's the captain of the Hawks, and the districts are redrawn in a gerrymandering scheme that we don't really get into, in which Adam Banks is suddenly drafted on district five. Now see it's worth mentioning right here that there is another running theme throughout The Mighty Ducks Trilogy, and that all the referees are basically 1980s WWF referees where they're not paying attention. It's you could run up to a kid and hit him in the neck, and he's like nope, turn around. They're like come on man, I didn't see ****",

And then his mother leaves right away; she doesn't want a deadbeat son, no. And then he turns to that darkness - she goes, \"Mar.\" So what happens with the mom is she goes and marries into a family where the mom had died, but the son is going to Cornell and playing hockey there because she wants... I made all of that up; it doesn't actually happen. So let's talk about some of the running themes in the trilogy here.

Again, the Redemption game, Iceland penalty shots, all these kinds of things, they win.
