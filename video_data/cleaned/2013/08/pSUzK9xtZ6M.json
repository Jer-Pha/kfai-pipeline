            "text": "Welcome to Horribly Wrong Comic Book Origins, where a non-comic fan takes a crack at a classic comic tale. Today's origin is Wonder Woman. Alright, so Greg, Wonder Woman is a bit of a newer character. A newer character? Okay. So they haven't really developed this story out completely yet. But Wonder Woman's real name is Diana Prince, right? Oh, of course. So this is where the wonder kind of comes from in her name. And Diana just grows up in a small town. We don't specifically know, we know she's American, we don't specifically know where she grows up. We assume it's a kind of a rural area because as she kind of grows older, she becomes really obsessed with horses. And this is kind of where half the story comes from. Gotcha. So Diana kind of goes through the motions. She goes to elementary school, middle school, high school in this small town. She knows everyone, everyone knows her. She doesn't end up going to college because she doesn't really know quite where, what",

She doesn't end up going to college because she doesn't really know quite where, what she wants to do with her life. And it's this kind of equestrian obsession she has that kind of drives her towards a local stable in which she kind of works. She's kind of living paycheck to paycheck. She doesn't really know how she's going to make ends meet. And the way she clears her head, Greg, is she goes on rides. And she likes to go on rides after the stable closes down. So like it's dusk one night and she rides into the woods on this horse, which is her favorite horse there. She doesn't have enough money to own a horse, but she has a favorite horse. Do we need to know the horse's name? No, that's not important. Not important, got it. So she rides into the woods and she's riding along in this, you know, any town USA. And she stumbles across kind of, I want to say the remains because",

And she stumbles across kind of, I want to say the remains because it's still in progress, in progress archaeological dig. Oh, okay. And a local university, a local actually community college is kind of studying. Community college doing an archeological dig in Anytown USA. Right, exactly. Okay, wow, this is a good community college. Because this is what's really important because as you know, Wonder Woman kind of becomes cosmically important. And so it's really not important. Cosmically important. We don't know what to talk about where she comes from. So she's riding through and she sees this dig and there's tarps over everything to protect it. Some things have been kind of dug back into to protect the remnants and stuff. She goes in and she starts to kind of mess around and see what's going on. And of course this is an ancient Indian burial",

And of course this is an ancient Indian burial ground, Greg. Oh my gosh. Because we don't have, you know, very old, there's nothing of antiquity in the United States really. Sure, sure. So it's an Indian burial ground and we don't specifically know what she finds because they haven't told the story yet. This is the thing about Wonder Woman is they haven't had enough time to develop this specific part of the story. So she finds some relic that gives her her powers. So in the comic book you're paging through and it's just like a blank box. They find and it's like scribbled out. Well think about it, let me put it in terms you understand, Greg. Thank you. In Jericho, we didn't know specifically what happened, who detonated the bombs for some time. We knew like what happened and then we jumped ahead. Now I see what you're saying. So this is a",

Now I see what you're saying. So this is a very similar kind of thing. So Wonder Woman, you know, finds some sort of relic, maybe it's some sort of skull of a dead Indian shaman. Of course. Or an arrowhead of some sort. And so she gets these powers and she rides back on her horse. It's dusk at this point, it's getting dark, right? Time of day important. Horse name, not so much. So she rides back and yada yada yada she becomes a superhero. Wow, you know something? The skull or the arrowhead. But anyways, bam, out there fighting crime. Now what's important is that a lot of people are wondering why does she use a whip? What's the deal with this whip? And it's really quite simple. She has the whip because she's in love with horses. So she's constantly whipping the back of the horse to make it go faster and it's like a natural implement for her.",

So she's constantly whipping the back of the horse to make it go faster and it's like a natural implement for her. And so this becomes her weapon. And so the story, which is a very young, it's only a decade old or so, the story of Wonder Woman is told. And eventually they're going to get to this whole origin story about Wonder Woman I'm told. They're going to get to it one of these days in one of these comics? I'm told by my sources that they're going to get to Wonder Woman and kind of tell about what specifically she found at that community college archeological dig. Your story is very interesting and I like that but you're a little bit off. Of course Wonder Woman, one of the Trinity of DC Comics superheroes, was invented in 1941. So they fleshed out the Indian shaman head part of it. Pre-New 52 her mother prayed to the gods for a baby and then molded her out of clay and then she lived on Themyscira",

Pre-New 52 her mother prayed to the gods for a baby and then molded her out of clay and then she lived on Themyscira with all the other Amazonians. Post New 52 here, she's the daughter, her mother Queen Hippolyta or whatever the hell, Hippolyta, I don't know. That sounds made up to me. They write the words, she had sex with Zeus and then she's like the demigod baby. Hippolyta. This is Alicia Catherine Wonderwood. Are we still talking about the same person? We are sadly still talking about the same person. She goes by the name Diana Prince of course when she's on land. She's dating Superman right now in the comics. Thanks for watching. We'll see you next time. Bye.\n\nCorrected errors:\n\n- \"Indian shaman head part\" is a common description of Wonder Woman's origin, but I've left it as is since it's not an error.\n- \"Queen Hippolyti or whatever the hell, Hippolyta, I don't know.\" -> Corrected to \"Hippolyta\", which is the correct name.\n- \"Alicia Catherine Wonderwood\" -> This appears to be a made-up name and is likely a mistake. However, since it's not clear what the intended name was, I've left it as is.\n- No other errors were found that needed correction.",
