See, Superman is an orphan, right? He lands in America; he doesn't know what's going on; he lands in our world and then all the great parts of America, all the good values, all the down-home spirit of the bread basket of this here country gets imbibed in them by the time he learns how he's a Kryptonian. Everything else, he's like, \"Well, it's okay, but I'm going to sit here and fight for what's right on the planet Earth and protect Earth and take care of Earth.\" And it's a great story. And he takes really good care of all of us. See, the cool thing about Superman, of course, is that he is you know basically a God, right? He can fly; he can shoot heat out of his eyes; he can do all these crazy things, but he chooses not to let the power go to his head. Right, you always remember this from high school history absolutely",

You always remember this from high school history: absolute power corrupts absolutely. Not in the case of Superman; he could very easily kill all the world's leaders and take over, and just rule the Earth as he sees fit. And some of the good stories that you see in the Superman continuity about this - such as Injustice: Gods Among Us, the comic book, which you should be reading right now, digital download from DC Comics - they toy with that idea. But the basis is that Superman doesn't; he's such a pure person, and he doesn't do this. And I've talked about this before on my podcast, Gregway. The fact that I went to Catholic school for the first 13 years of my life - kindergarten through high school - every year going to get in uniform, going to masses.",

It's Superman's morality tale - it's a bootstraps, raise yourself up from the ground thing. It's an outsider tale. There's so much to get into, and I'll tell you why I think a lot of people don't like Superman is the fact that the Christopher Reeve movies everything up and don't get me wrong, love these movies; love the Richard Donner movie. But the problem is, it's just one piece of Superman - it's just one interpretation of the character for Superman. But for a lot of people, it's their only thing right? So people saw those movies and they're like, \"Man, this guy can time travel, he can rewind the time of the earth and undo everything.\" That's way too powerful, and they're right; it was too powerful. And of course, this is a big problem in comics that's why there was a whole crisis thing back in the day that",

Of course, this is a big problem in comics, which is why there was a whole Crisis thing back in the day that basically depowered Superman a bit, brought all the universes together, made one DC Comics universe, made one Superman who wasn't so crazy powerful that he could just push planets out of orbit when an asteroid was coming in and bring them back. They got rid of that. I grew up reading about a Superman who still was Superman, obviously bullets bounce off, and all that. But you know, he had to go through trials and tribulations; things got in his way; he had villains that could match him; he died; Doomsday, and everything else. There's a lot to Superman; he's a multifaceted character. And I think one of the big problems with comics today is the ongoing comic makes for really boring storylines.

Uh, if I had my way, and I bought DC Comics, I'd say, \"Great, we know all these characters. Let's not do so many ongoing series, and instead let's say Jeff Johns, I want you to write a 12-issue Superman story, and that'll be it.\" And it'll happen outside of any continuity. You'll be able to read it, enjoy it. You know, these characters - Lex Luthor's up to something maybe he's not. You look at the things that are most exciting right now at DC; it's the digital stuff. It is Injustice. It is Smallville because they're allowed to do whatever they want with it. Right? Injustice is simply all hell is broken loose, Metropolis has been destroyed, Lois is dead. What would Superman do with that information, and that's a super interesting story. You're able to kill characters in that that you're not, meanwhile, and what I feel are the boring books of the New 52 such",

Nothing can beat a great Superman book, that's why I told you in one of the other Gregways: go read Last Son, it's by Geoff Johns and Richard Donner - you will love it. And if you don't, you're stupid. So there you go. Thank you so much for your question 77, Jappy. If you have one, ladies and gentlemen, leave them in the comments here on this episode of Gregway or tweet me at GameOverGreggy - I don't care either way. Then make sure you subscribe to this channel so you can come back every Wednesday and Friday and see me answer another question here on Gregway.\"",
