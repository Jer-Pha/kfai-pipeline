What's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation with Colin. I'm Greg, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into the random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at them, and we talk it out for your amusement if you like that. Like the video, subscribe to us on YouTube, and share this video with your friends. Are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is the dos and don'ts of bar etiquette from The Bar Podcast. Wonder why they care; I'll tell you the first one: when you go to the bar, make eye contact with the bartender at some point and smile. Don't sit there and be a dick with your money out; don't be all yelling; don't be on your phone. These are why they ignore you when you go to the bar. Go to the bar, smile. You understand that they're working hard; he or she.",

And then that forces you to give them a $150 tip. I think that's why they do it. Partilla, don't eat that beef stick. I think that's why they do it. When I was in Austin, Texas, I did that; I went to a bar of the same kind where I was like, \"Okay, it's $450,\" and then I get and I leave them the 50 cents and the dollar, and I'm like, \"Wait a second; I'm wise to this game.\" Yeah, I think I think that's a little messed up. But my favorite bar in... there's a few bars I like in San Francisco. If you want to go underdogs is really one of our standbys; that's 19th in Irving; that's a really good bar. In terms of more traditional bars, Yan's in the Inner",

But in terms of more traditional bars, Yancy's in the Inner Sunset I really like. And the reason I like Yancy's is there's a few reasons right? Got an old feel to it, it's like it's carpeted, it's all dirty, there are tables and people hanging out, people in the back playing Yahtzee like playing darts like doing all sorts of stuff. But you can also bring outside food in there, that is a nice move, yes. And like you can bring in whatever you want so you can bring in like a whole pizza and eat it at a table or like bring in your burritos. I really like that part of that bar. Yancy's gets too crowded on like Saturday nights for me, that's the problem, it's too loud, it's super hot in there, I'm not a fan of that. And then they are playing games in the back you can't hear. I I'm already hard of hearing, that's why I like Fireside a lot. Fireside is a good bar to go chat at.",
