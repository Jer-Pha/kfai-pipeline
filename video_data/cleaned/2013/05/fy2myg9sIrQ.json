It's not because it's an abomination, but you know it's whatever. It's not an Oreo. This is just saccharine. Oh man, it's not it. It's just that the cakestir is not an Oreo. As I'm sure you knew and were well aware that this is not an Oreo either. Do I have other shows? Well, you bet your bottom dollar I do. Silly goose. But I'm not ready to talk about them yet. But subscribe and as soon as they are live, you will know. Until then, beyond. Oh, and I have a wiener dog named Greggy's favorite, Patilla, that everybody loves.\"",
