That's why we started this YouTube series where we make season two predictions about the hit ABC drama. Kristine, we go through, pair people up, tell them what we think is gonna happen to him in season two. We're starting this episode with Lamar and Tandy. Yes, Lamar of course - the old man who was like... I loved him in episode one. Lamar you know starts pulling the strings, he's gonna make Teddy the mayor to get his baseball stadium, and then that thread totally went quiet forever and ever and ever. And Lamar popped back up to talk about his baseball thing in the second half of the season - almost it seemed. It seemed like we were talking about the baseball stadium, yeah. He's been there, he's been there. But I want more Lamar, I love Lamar, Lamar's great. He does have a really good power booth is his name, by the",

I think Tandy and this is this is a random thing yeah I think she is going to go either start up her own company or join in forces with a rival company and try and get the baseball stadium built there um yeah see I think that's it it's definitely them butting heads all of a sudden but it's gotta be because she quit in Season Two or something seasonal yeah yeah and remember like that like business stuff isn't super exciting so I think she's gonna try to she already tried to blow everything up with Coleman right where she went to call me I was like looking at the",

You know who she'll team up with? I've been waiting for this one; I've been waiting to work him in, Wade. Oh, why the old music producer guy who cheated on...who? Yeah, he had an affair with Lamar's wife, and that's what ruined his relationship with Reba. That's a good point; we've been waiting for that to come out because he flipped out of the hospital. So if you wanted to hurt him, what would you do? If you're Tammy, yeah, you team up. Although I don't know what he does except for...yeah, he's got a ton of money. It doesn't matter; that's true. Hey, help me finance this baseball stadium or this uh construction company or whatever; that could work. But then Wade always seems like a nice guy; she's a really nice guy, so she would have to manipulate him in some way in order to convince him to do this",

And in that case, I guess for them, for both of them, I would say it's business first, family second. Okay, interesting. We'll see what happens in Season Two. Uh, before we say goodbye to our predictions, we're gonna do the Wild Card prediction. Christine, as you know, each and every episode ends with us letting the gods make a prediction. We made our educated guesses, but you're gonna reach in the People bag, then the Places or Things bag, and we're gonna see what happens. We'll see, we'll see what they think's gonna happen, the gods. So who do we got in the People back? Gunner. Oh, Gunner, the biggest... the biggest... what's gonna happen to don't know Gunner Season Two not really. I like that actor. Wait, it's it's cut off. Ah, it's because it's a two-parter. Oh, Gunner, the first part is has sex.",
