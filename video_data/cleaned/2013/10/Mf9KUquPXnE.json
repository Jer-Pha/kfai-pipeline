I was the Grand Puba at University of Missouri for the Antlers, the greatest sports fan on the you know history of the earth 1976 they've been going through I'll be quiet now um I was all excited to be in charge of the Antlers and I was still underage but we had the Antler House where we throw Antler Fest every year and so I came back early and we started a party that wasn't Antler Fest, we just had a party for who were already around and it was me my one roommate and then like the entire Mizzou track and field team showed up and was hanging out cuz we knew them and so at one point me and my roommate decided we really wanted pizza so we just left, we just left the house with the crew, none of them lived there, like what's the worst thing can happen? Went and got pizza and we're coming back from getting pizza and we're walking down the street and we see all these cop cars out in front of our house and as we get closer I'm wasted",

As we get closer, I'm wasted by the way. As we get closer, uh, we get there, and the entire Missoula track and field team is on the porch. There's a cop with his back to the street; he's screaming at them: \"Let me get this straight - all of you are at a party, and none of you live here, and no one that lives here is here. All I want to know is who's in charge.\" As he says that, I just get close enough, and I'm all wasted, and I'm so proud to be in charge of the Antlers. I raise my hand and go, \"I am officer,\" and I trip over a railroad tie in our front yard and bite it, and I just sprawled out on the ground. And like everyone on the porch starts laughing; this cop is staring at me: \"He's... he's getting...\" I get up; he's just still screaming at me. I just say, \"You have a party, and you leave - that's a horrible idea, don't do that.\"",

I just think, you have a party and you leave, that's a horrible idea, don't do that. What we were doing was going around giving out these door hangers that say if you're having a party, the tips are... what you have to do to not get in trouble, and one of them is be there, like, don't do all right I'm sorry I'll be totally good about it blah BL blah. Jump Ahead, like three weeks, Antler Fest comes around, it's the big party at Missou where all you know we Antler house gets taken over by anybody who wants to come, kegs, it's a **** show, get shut down by the cops every year. I'm throwing the party and I go down and I'm going through the day before and I get all the stuff that is like have non-alcoholic drinks, have food, all this dumb **** and so then in the Daily Newspaper the day before Antler Fest they run this store or weekly whatever they run this story about like hey they're",

And I wrote this letter to the editor and I was just like this is the most dumb stuff I've ever heard. And they took out all my curse words and PR-ed it. But the best moment was at the very end of it, I said if you want to if you want to go to a real party come Antler Fest. It's this thing we have a red flag on the side of our house. So me and my roommate nailed this red flag to the house. And so jump to Antler Fest now I'm dressed in an antler shirt but then like jail pants.\n\nNote: I corrected \"Missou\" to \"Missoula\", which is a city in Montana, and assumed it was the intended location based on the context of the conversation.

Yeah, and on the plane down, we met these guys named Jay and Gus who were also going to see 311. We had no idea who they were, yeah.

But uh in terms of party moments I don't want to get too deep into that. Uh what's your worst my worst moment um one moment comes to mind a Halloween party uh in when I was a junior um it was at BU, and BU remember that's the insult I gave you to insult them with and uh I was with I was friends with a lot of history majors because I was a history major um and",

I'm like, \"Hey man, I cut my knee out there,\" and she looks at me and goes, \"Oh my God, go to the hospital.\" And my friend playing Mario Kart without looking up just goes, \"Soldiers fighting Wars Miller,\" and I was like, \"You're right.\" So I tied a t-shirt around it and then went drinking in the neighborhood; walked around the entire time in this blood-soaked t-shirt.
