Welcome to A Conversation with Colin. I'm Greg, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, throw it at them, we talk it out for your amusement if you like that. Like the video, subscribe to us here, then leave a comment below telling us what you wanted us to talk about. We're here all the time right? Are you ready? Yes. Your first topic is that you have no idea about why Google is the worst thing ever, submitted by LaserDethCannon. Thank you very much. Uh, K, why is Google the worst thing ever? Do you agree with this being the worst thing ever? It's not the worst thing ever. I mean, you can think about, you know, fascism would probably be on that list, you know, as Kansas may maybe on that list, uh, the Soviet Union from after World War II until",

As Kansas may maybe on that list, uh, the Soviet Union from after World War II until the collapse maybe it would be, you know. So there's a few things on that list that would be worse than Google but Google's maybe one of the scariest things, yeah. You see it's trendy now to be scared of Google as they buy all these things and they want you to log in and all the things. Colin was at the forefront of being scared of Google; I mean I met him six years ago at Denny's he was talking about how evil Google was, it's true. Why are you so scared of Google? Um, so Google has Google's a great service, I mean like the search engine itself is brilliant everyone uses it I use it every day, um and I think that they've become scary because they do everything and so now now you have a Google name you know you sign in with your Google name and and suddenly you're you you're using like their video.",

They know everything about you; yeah, they know all the dirty stuff you search for on Google. They read all your emails so they know how to advertise to you. They uh, you know, they're logging everything; they don't delete. If you didn't know, YouTube's owned by Google, this is happening to you right now. Yeah, yeah, YouTube's another great example. I mean, you're going to get the oration videos, you're going to get lose weight videos; it's all coming your way. I mean, that's what a lot of people don't understand about Google, and like I'm not going to stop using Google; I don't sign in when I use",

It's one of those things where I feel like I should be scared, but I'm not scared. I like Google. I feel like they're the ones who speak to me with all this technology; they make it easy. I hope they go as far as to end up replacing all sign-in with Facebook. I don't want to sign in with Facebook; just let me sign in with Google, I'm already logged into Google. It sucks that Google+ isn't more right \u2013 that's the one from The Social Network \u2013 because I would rather it replace Facebook and it's just an easy thing. But I understand what you're saying. Here's the weird thing: I've seen this story play out before. It was called Batman Beyond, or Project Batman Eye; he made a satellite called Brother Eye that he put in the sky, and it knew everything about him. Yeah, yeah, he's Bruce Wayne \u2013 he's got a lot of money.",

Three Donald Trumps couldn't get a satellite off the earth, I don't know. I mean he got permission from the government to do this? Probably not. I mean, well, Wayne Enterprises has all these contracts obviously with the Army. I'm sure at some point you could finagle your way and say, \"Hey, take this up, General Kaiser.\" General Kaiser takes it right up. Um, yeah. So I don't think Google - like, you know, YouTube's awesome, uh, you know, Google's awesome. If I didn't like those things, I would tell you, you know that.

I never knew it had a name, yeah, yeah, it does - what's the Jeopardy? Oh, that's another thing too. We so there you go, LaserDethCannon, Google not the worst thing ever, the scariest thing ever.
