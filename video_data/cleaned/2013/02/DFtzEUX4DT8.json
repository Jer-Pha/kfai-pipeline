Nowhere every episode of Oreo Orations begins the review process the same way: The first look, tear up in the Nabisco seal and see what we're getting into. Well, uh, they look pretty good right; they don't look terrible. We got some bulging cookies over here, a little bit of separation on the cookies there. This one's all smushed down. I don't like it when the cookies don't look the same; they need to look uniform. Here we're getting them all smushed around; were these kicked around? I don't know, that's how they came to me. Let's smell the bouquet again; it's the shortbread and probably the white frosting working together that are really coming out and being pronounced flavors. Uh, let's get right to it though, the next part of it, of course, taste. We've got the white cookie on top, black cookie on top; you can just switch them around however you see fit doesn't really matter here comes the",

You can just switch them around however you see fit; doesn't really matter. Here comes the taste test. I don't know how this is possible, but the white cookie, the sugar cookie, shortbread - you're a fan of the show, you know all about it overpowering it here probably because it's got a taste so similar to the cream, the cream of an Oreo, very sweet. You getting double stuffed? You could almost call it a triple stuff at this point because you have the white cookie working with the white frosting. Oh, there's some chocolate. Maybe it all depends on what side you eat. Hold on. Oh, that's chocolatey. This is a giant mess of cookie in my mouth, but the taste is out there. It's a very sweet cookie, not your normal balance of an Oreo. Let's see how it pairs with milk. Get a glass going there. Give it the old triple do - one, two, three. Again, it's that sweet cream taste from both the cookie and the vanilla cookie.",

I'm going to go flat 7/7.0 um it's good. I think a lot of people out there will enjoy it. Not my personal cup of tea but I can see why you at home might like this if you're a big fan of golden, if you're a big fan of sweet creamy taste that cream texture of the cookie it's there for you. So that ladies and gentlemen is how the cookie crumbles for Double Stuf Oreo Heads or Tails. But what do you think? Leave your review of this cookie as a video response below. Like the video, subscribe to my YouTube channel. But here's the big thing: are there Oreos out there that I'm missing? I'm sure there are. Tell me what they are in the comments below. Leave the cookie, leave where it can be purchased, leave what state you live in, what country you're in so I know then share the video with your friends.

But until then, keep on dunking Oreo.\n\nI corrected phonetic mistakes and spelling errors, especially for names and brands (e.g., \"Oreo\" is now capitalized as it should be). I also added the missing word \"Oreo\" at the end of the sentence to maintain the original meaning.",
