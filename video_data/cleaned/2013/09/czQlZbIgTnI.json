I was going to bring my car, uh, I brought an air mattress, you know some odds and ends - that was going to be it, that's all I needed. I figured my TV of course, all my consoles, and so I decided, you know what, I'm going to drive out there, I'm going to get a U-Haul, I'm going to tow my car and I'm going to drive out there. Now when I told my father this plan, who is like basically you know heavy equipment operator, he's like \"you've never driven a U-haul before, that doesn't sound like something you could do\" and I'm like \"you, you never do anything till you do it, dad\", I'm going to do it.

I can go north or I can go south, and take you know, go up through the Rockies, or I can go down here and like it turned if I was going to go down here, you know, and go off that way through like the desert, whatever it was going to be a longer drive, so I said no thanks. And uh, on top of that, I should point out that there were like tornadoes and thunderstorms and all this horrible stuff happening in the South. However, up north, there was this winter snow system moving through, but it looked like I... I could get around it if I went up there and just maybe I would just miss it or whatever. I was going to shoot through Nebraska - you're heavier than you look, so I quit deciding I'm going north to get west",

By the way, this is a problem. I was planning on dragging it, you know, over like three days out to San Francisco. So I call U-Haul, they're like, \"Oh, we didn't know what you wanted to do about it, man.\" And so things are not going right to begin with. To begin my journey out west, I had to drive southeast for like 45 minutes to go to another U-Haul in the middle of nowhere, Missouri, get one of the ones that could tow an entire car up on its thing, drive back to Columbia, load up my car, then get on the road. I'm already way behind schedule; I'm not happy about this, but I do it. Take off, drive you know, I-70 out in Missouri, then start going north like I planned right.

And I get maybe 30 or 45 minutes down the road, and it's like all snow, and it's just really bad - whiteout conditions. I'm like, \"Huh?\" So I finally turn off the PSP, and there's no other cars on the road by the way - usually a red flag on the highway, there's not even a truck on the road. Turn off the PSP, put on the radio, and the radio is like, \"Get off the roads, you're stupid!

I'm like, what's up, man? Like, yeah, you can't go that way. It's even worse down there. Uh, they're closing the highway pretty soon too, so you don't want to go that way. And I'm like, oh crap. Well, I'll double back to the hotel I was at right. Like, I'll just go back over the overpass, back down the other side, and onto the highway, and go back to the hotel I was coming from. So I leave, come up the... you know, I'm coming over up to the top of the overpass, and I come back down, and I apply the brakes to turn, but there are no brakes.

And I'm like, trying everything; I just can't get it out. And I climb out of the car, and I walk over, and this big rig was just starting to pull down. And I run over, and I wave him down, and the guy rolls in, like, \"What's up?\" And I'm like, \"Sir, I have no idea what the heck I'm doing. I'm having a terrible day. I've been stuck now for...the car. Can you please help me?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, yeah.\" And he climbed out and came over and gave me some tips on how to drive a giant U-Haul. Got it moved; I went over, took up like four parking spots in the parking lot, parked it, went upstairs, got a room, went upstairs, uh, took a nice hot shower because I was just disgusting. And then I ordered a pizza at Pizza Hut, cuz there was a Pizza Hut in the parking lot. Uh, I'll never forget you; I ate the pizza and threw up.",

Uh, I'll never forget you; I ate the pizza, threw the stuff away. I moved the nightstand so I could plug in my phone, and there was like a pile of unopened condoms back there. But somebody was having a wild weekend with their girlfriend or whatever, and they'd dropped all their condoms back there, and there's like 30 condoms piled up. I'm like, \"Whatever,\" and I plugged it in. I passed out, and the next morning at like I don't even remember any, but I guess it was like 5:45 or whatever. I got a phone call from my mom who's just sobbing; she's just like, \"I've been watching the weather all night long, and it's not getting better. Please go back to Missouri.\" And we'll if they won't if they won't pay to ship your things, I'll ship them for you, and we'll get in your stuff. I'm just like again emotionally defeated; I'm just like okay. So like I call Jeremy",

Wakey, wakey, sleepy head! And he goes, \"It's 4 in the morning,\" and I'm like, \"I know, sorry.\" It turns out I'm not going to be there on time; I'm going to be a day late at least because I got to go do this. So I drove back to Missouri that day, uh, then got a plane out to IGN, shipped most of my stuff, didn't die in a blizzard because of the kindness of Earl. So Earl, if you are watching this YouTube video, I'm glad - first off, I'm glad you have the internet now in your trailer; second off, thank you very much for saving my life.
