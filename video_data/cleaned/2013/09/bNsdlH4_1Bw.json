They're the Karaoke Masters, is what they call themselves. So they come out, host the whole thing, they do a little act, and then yeah, they call you up to come do your song and then they stay on and sing behind you as back-up for you and help you out. So the first night I ever met Greg was there. This is when I had only met him at IGN about six or seven months prior, right? You started in July, you said yeah, so right well not less than that even, and uh, I had this obsession with Ed's Ichiban Library, Hillary, and I lived right by it, so we found it and we wanted to go there all the time, so we started going there. I think it's only like a year or something.\"",

You were in a Yankees cap; you still had all your tattoos and stuff. And do you remember what happened? We sang there, we drank, we hung out forever. Yeah, so yeah... A little backstory: So I started freelancing trying when I was 18 months old, and when I was 19, I was still in college during a summer between my sophomore junior year at Northeastern. I came to IGN and lived on Chris Carle's floor for about a month and a half. Then I slept on Mark Ryan's floor with a pillow and a blanket for about a month. I was an intern; I had like a mohawk, and I was loud and annoying and just happy to be there and kind of like not.",

We had been drinking - I think we went to Pescatore's and then we're drinking or whatever - and like we rounded a corner and I rolled down the window and I screamed at Jay and Silent Bob quote 'Hey, there were two girls on the corner waiting for the bus' and I scream at them, 'I go hey ladies, you ever had your... eaten by a fat man in an overcoat?'
