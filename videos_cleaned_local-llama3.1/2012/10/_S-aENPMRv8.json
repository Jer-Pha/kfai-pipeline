Last time, the Bouquet from here, I can already smell the cool mint. The quotient is quite powerful, quite powerful of course it looks like you know maybe taking on those Skinny Mints you might hear or see from other places. Ah so let's go taste from these weirdly packaged bet a poor first look. Poor first look here we go for the taste bit perplexing I'll tell you right now it's perplexing. The smell is so strong, you expect to be jumping into a Thin Mint of course I'm making reference to the Thin Mints but you get in here the smell is really strong. You get into the actual biting of a Cool Mint cookie, the taste isn't overpowering, it's very not there, it first doesn't taste like anything, won't a clog I'm eating a Cool Mint Oreo but is there it's there a little bit okay taste not great either let's jump to how it goes with milk again if you're joining us for the first time every\"",

If you're joining us for the first time, every Oreo cookie will take it, but how then did the taste? How does everything come together with milk? It's not such a big part of an order; you got to dunk them and get them nice and saturated - they're a big part of saturation. Well, people don't know that. Not at all, not happy with how this is pairing with them again. It's just a chocolate cookie. We talked about how the berry burst could give hints of strawberry. I'm giving basically no mint, but then there's a mint aftertaste, which is weird - not even a regular Oreo. Also, did I eat the mint? What is it or you? It's got to be one of the other kinds. People aren't twisting this big part. Let's see how it whips together here. Twist a part, I guess we say. Ah, come on. What is that? No kid wants to do that. I am. I'll give it a second chance.",
