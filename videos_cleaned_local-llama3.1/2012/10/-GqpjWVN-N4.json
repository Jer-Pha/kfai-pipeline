Take the P.O. it's not very good, I mean um so in the 90s in the mid-90s there was something called the Project for a New American Century and it was a policy for a New American Century and it was the origins of the neoconservative movement that took over the Republican Party towards the end of Clinton's Administration and then basically the Bush Administration and what PNAC said was um you know it was basically almost an imperialist Mantra of um American Empire basically that we would kind of have um many eggs in many baskets and kind of be policing the world and doing our thing or whatever which you kind of saw play out during the Iraq War um with people that were signatories on the PNAC um that were in the Bush Administration such as Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney why I tell you that story is because PNAC turned the Republican Party into something that it wasn't and what we're dealing with now are kind of the repercussions of PNAC",

The fact that you don't hate gay people there, I think Republicans to a lot of people is a dirty word nowadays because it's so veered off on this track of well, yeah, I'm Republican; that means I'm for a responsible government about money and then not having gay marriage ruin my world.

I think the way to get what we want, the way to get where we need to go rather is to change it from the inside. And that's what I'm trying to do. Because like any political party, they're malleable and they change over time somewhat, yeah, not much but somewhat. And if we can drive social conservatism out of the Party, Republicans win every single election from that point forward. This is what we talk about right?

I mean, I was a huge Ron Paul fan in 2008, but I'm not really in the Ron Paul movement anymore because I kind of feel like he couldn't really articulate his stance well enough. He's really old now; well, he is. But I also feel like he could have easily been the standard-bearer of the party if he was just able to articulate his position better, which he wasn't. And that was kind of disappointing to me. But I think his movement, the libertarian movement, the Ron Paul Revolution as it's going to be called in the history books \u2013 and it's already called \u2013 has brought in a lot of young people into the party; um, in their teens and their well now they're in their 20s and their 30s.

My whole mantra is if you're not hurting anyone, you know do onto others, you know what I mean, um to each his own Live and Let Live and I really believe in that so if a gay man wants to marry another gay man or a woman wants to marry another woman or whatever like who the **** cares if we have another family that can support a child and you know and raise children even if they adopt them or have to adopt them that's great that's important that's good stuff it doesn't mean you can't",
