Um, a lot of questions lately about cancer because I got cancer - if that didn't clue you - and I have Hodgkin lymphoma. And one of the big questions I get is what is chemotherapy like? People think either number one it's like I'm getting irradiated in a tube like you'd expect from The Incredible Hulk, or number two it's like 50/50 and in a room with other people eating pot brownies. And the fact of the matter is this is what chemotherapy is like. Look around; give me a good pan. You see there's some hand sanitizer on the wall? Yeah, there's a bunch of stuffs in here they use to plug him into, but anyways... I mean, the basics are that uh I come in here every two weeks for my kind of chemotherapy, I guess, and I sit in this chair which is very comfortable. And I get something shoved into my arm, and for four hours I sit here and play PlayStation.",
