I want some sort of realism in this. And if Batman is going to fight Joker for like 7 years at some point the guy must be murdered you know because he's killing other people and he's causing havoc in Gotham. And it's like, just put him in prison a few times, he breaks out. Just kill him. See now this is what's always so interesting about you though is that you're so into America right? You have these tattoos for the American Revolution, you love law, you love our society. Batman can't walk if he does that, he's no better than the Joker. He can't go around killing everybody who's ever been bad to him. I know I'm not saying that he has to... you know I'm not saying that you know the first time he met Joker whenever the hell that was and uh he you know Joker was pulling some gags and killing some people do",

And I'm not saying that Batman has to kill him like you know, and go on the lamb or something like that. Like I don't think Batman has to you know, literally take him out back and beat him. But why not, like you know, bring him to Gordon and the DA, whatever DA is working, and be like, \"Here he is, let's FastTrack this trial. We'll have a death sentence, we'll bring him to the chair or to the gas chamber, whatever, and just finish it.\" You know? Alright, there are no death penalty states, so there you go. Now what's your answer? Where are they? Yeah, it floats around Gotham is very nebulous on what it is. I mean, arguably Metropolis is New York and their world, and Gotham in Chicago. Oh really? Yeah, um, so I I understand, I understand that. I understand everything you're saying, everything you're saying makes sense.",

It's just a little frustrating that these they deal with these guys, these clowns over and over again for decades, and again, though here's the thing, that you're an idiot coming into our world just stomping around it. Decades is exaggerating a bit because stories get universes get rebooted, and even if they're not getting rebooted, you figure there's 12 issues a year that are telling one story right so it's not like in real time like a year for us is a year for them. So no, I understand that, and and but to me the the idea of the reboot almost gives uh gives the the creators an ability to kill off these characters and then bring them back again because it's like well we've rebooted so now these characters that you know and love, the Joker and the Penguin or whoever, like they're back.",

Yeah, you know, you clearly are, and uh, I, I understand why, why I understand completely what you're saying, but to me it's just it's just frustrating because it doesn't make any sense. That's why the Punisher is awesome, no that's why the Punisher sucks, and no one reads his comics, and no one goes sees his movies. Really, The Punisher is not popular well I mean he's popular every thinks he's got a cool shirt and cool guns and stuff but it's not like you're seeing a lot of Punisher fans see because as far as I understand",

But it's not like you're seeing a lot of Punisher fans see because as far as I understand the Punisher, his family was killed right by like a crime syndicate or something like that, and so he goes and kills them. And that makes a lot of sense; you know? And that makes a Punisher an emotional one, you see, like with Bruce Wayne, like his parents were killed, right? Yeah, and you know he's got like this emotional pent-up something in him, and he's become very successful, and all these things. But I don't see how he gets from point A to point B; you think he would actually be full of more vengeance than he is. And even though he keeps it kind of tapered, so that makes him, you know, M... it doesn't really make a lot of sense. The Punisher makes sense to me; that's a real person. The Punisher, as far as I'm concerned, that's like how a real person might react, might yeah not.",

The Punisher, as far as I'm concerned, that's like how a real person might react, might yeah not likely to but might react well. I think the Bat, I mean Bruce Wayne makes sense because his parents are killed so he wants to make sure no child ever actually suffers that fate again, that that there is that so he he that he another person in Gotham City never has to feel like they're so alone that they're all alone that this could happen that their world could be shattered like that. Okay, that's where it is but let me circle back to something you said a little bit earlier okay you you said something about how a lot of these superheroes are F like there's some tragedy to them Spider-Man Uncle Ben yeah oh so I was going to bring up Spider-Man as far as I understood with Spider-Man wasn't he just a nerd who was bitten by a spider and lived next to some chick that he liked",

Yeah, well, that's why Spider-Man is so popular, right? Is that because he is one of us? That he what is this Uncle Ben? What happens to him? He gets killed. You didn't see the original first I know the new one just came out. You see the one with Tobey Maguire. I did see that but I don't remember what happened. Was there something where he yeah, he could have stopped like he in the movie you're referencing, uh, the guy steals the money from the wrestler promoter runs out and the guy the wrestler promoter just screwed over Spider-Man so Spider-Man steps by and lets the guy go? Right, right, I he's like you could have stopped them. I don't see how.",

Yeah, that was great. But yeah, that was the point \u2013 he could have stopped it. That's when the whole 'great power, great responsibility' thing comes around. That's fair; I understand everything you're saying to me. It just doesn't jive with me, that's why I'm not in the comic books because I just can't. Cuz I tried to read one of your Superman comic books \u2013 yeah, and it's...I just Superman's not interesting either. But that's a whole another topic for another day.
