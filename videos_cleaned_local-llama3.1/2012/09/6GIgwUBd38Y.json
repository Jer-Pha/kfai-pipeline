I'm Greg, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin here says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday we throw a new topic of conversation at him; he responds, and he has no idea what's on my little cards here with conversations he gets one every Tuesday, Thursday, gets to talk about it. Colin, are you ready? Yeah, right! If you're ready at home, like this video, share it with your friends, subscribe to our YouTube channel. Today's topic of conversation is the Electoral College - what's its deal, Colin? Like we all get to vote and like, but the world doesn't trust us enough to like count our own votes. I have to have some other guy go and do it. Yeah, I mean so the Electoral College uh is really an old idea, and it makes perfect sense when you really think about it uh back after the Revolution was over and we were",

Of course, smaller states had a concern that the bigger states would trounce them electorally if they had bigger populations. So, when you think about states like Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts - the bigger states back then, yeah, they would dwarf electorally the states with smaller populations if it was just proportional based on the electorate of those states. So a state like Georgia or Delaware or Maryland would just not have a voice. But I so in order to balance that, yeah, they said you will vote for electors that will then cast a vote, you know, quote unquote, uh, at the national level. And so the electoral votes would go um and count more for the smaller states. So a state like Delaware has three electoral votes - that's the fewest you can have",

I mean you live in San Francisco, you know everyone here has a bunch of crazy ideas they don't listen to each other. Wouldn't it be one idea that dominates everything? Yeah, I mean I wouldn't use California as an example just because California is a complete disaster. But when you think about it this way, even today, think about a state like Wyoming. Wyoming has very few people, like under 100,000 and but they have certain things that must be dealt with at a federal level, like for instance ranching and farming and stuff like that. Things that maybe the agriculture department will have to deal with and stuff like that. But if you were just to take their electorate of maybe 100-150,000 people that actually vote there, and the needs of Wyoming would be drowned out by the millions and millions and millions of people that vote in California.",

But if you give them three electoral votes, even though California has many more than that \u2013 many, many more than that \u2013 they still count a little bit higher. It gives them a little bit more of a voice, so it makes the small states feel like they have something to say. And I don't mean small states just geographically again; I mean small states by population. Because a bigger state in population, you know, Rhode Island is a good example of a state with a bigger population than you would think of the size of the state. Uh, and Massachusetts is the same way. Vermont has no people, Wyoming has no people, The Dakotas have no people, and those people wouldn't have a voice at the national level if that the Electoral College didn't exist \u2013 at least in terms of presidential politics",

The Dakotas have no people, and those people wouldn't have a voice at the national level if that were the case, thanks to the Electoral College, at least in terms of presidential politics. So I mean, it's down to two people when it comes to president every year, yeah. And is one going to be like, \"Well, Agriculture,\" and the other guy's like, \"I'm Pro-Agriculture.\" Then Wyoming is going to be like, \"Everybody has to vote for the agriculture guy.\" Yeah, I'm just saying that you know a state, a state like Delaware was the first to ratify the Constitution because of something like the Electoral College, because none of those states would have ratified the Constitution if we didn't have the Electoral College in place, because they were afraid of being drowned out at the national level. So if you actually change your Electoral College by amendment, you would have to kind of wonder if the Constitution itself would have to be ratified.",

I think there's a rational realistic reason why it exists and I actually don't think it affects the big States at all so people don't really need to worry about it if you got rid of it, the small states would suffer, the big States wouldn't suffer, the big States actually would have all the say, New York and California and Texas would basically dominate everything. Well they already do though, not really I mean I mean those states don't turn you know Texas always going to vote",

I mean, I mean those states don't turn you know Texas always going to vote Republican and those States always vote Democrat but when you think about the sheer amount of people in those States and then you take everything in the middle of the country and put it into a ball and it has the same population as those three states that's problematic at a national level and it's not fair. Okay, well Colin I think that about wraps up this conversation if you enjoyed this conversation make sure you like the video share it with your friends subscribe to us here on YouTube youtube.com/gameovergreggy then check back every Tuesday and Thursday where I will shove a new topic into Colin's head and we'll see what he says about it until then I hope you have a conversational day",
