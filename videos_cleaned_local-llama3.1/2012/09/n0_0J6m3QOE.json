Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg Miller, and this is my roommate Colin Moriarty. Now, Colin says some crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my topic pile, pick one, toss it at him. Colin has no idea what's in the topic pile; he hears it when you hear it. If you like that idea, like this video, share it with your friends. Then subscribe to us. Colin, are you ready? Yes, to today's topic of conversation: Cats vs. Dogs. Which do you like more? Cats much more. Why? Um, well, I mean, I think part of it, I mean honestly has to do with what I grew up with. I grew up with cats; I never had a dog. I always had cats. Um, but I just think cats are are more my kind of animal. They're not needy; you don't really have to do anything for them. They kind of want their space; they like you every so often; they need to be petted or",

They're like you, yeah, because you like to be alone 99% of the time, yeah, that's the usual thing. I like to be alone about 95% of the time, 95% of the time. Um, so yeah, I I prefer cats. I think dogs are fine but they're you know they're needy and and basically like another member of your family that need to be fed and like you got to walk them and bathe them and like it's like all right enough, enough, enough's enough. All right. See, I used to be with you, I grew up with cats as well, then I got a dog, Portillo, follow him on Twitter, and I was like oh man he's great, and then I moved into this house with cat Chloe, don't follow her, and Chloe's disgusting, like it's it reminded me how like I I used to use I grew up with the cats, I thought I was a cat person.",

Like it's it reminded me how, like I, I used to use I grew up with cats. I thought I was a cat person, but part of what won me over to the dog side is because there's not like a box full of her stuff in my room, and then like Chloe comes out and just throws up all this hair. Yeah, it's like come on. Well, Chloe is a long-haired cat, and Mike Mitchell refuses to have her shaved down. Uh, so to kind of help her, because I mean she let's put it this way, she's not very disgusting because she has hairballs because she is constantly cleaning herself, so that, and that is the reason why she's throwing up hairballs. So Chloe's actually quite clean. Uh-huh. The litter box in the bathroom or whatever, Chloe's got a little bit of a problem that some cats do you know have, and I actually had a cat that had a similar problem which is that she just doesn't cover her stuff up so like most cats are very",

They don't clean themselves; you have to clean them. You know, all those things. Cats...you can pick up Chloe and just kind of put her fur right in your face, and she doesn't tell you anything at all ever. Mhm. You pick up Patton (corrected from \"Patillo\") - you do the same thing. He smells like...that's an exaggeration. Patton smells good once; now he's got a dog smell. He smells like a dog. Yeah, I don't like it at all. But at least he's not bigger because when a big dog smells like Patton does, the entire apartment or house would smell like that. Patton is so small and dumb that...he doesn't...he doesn't smell off the apartment quite as bad. You want to give\"",

You want to give your impression of Portilla before we go with the toy? Oh, he just looks very vacantly and just squeezes the toy and he can just look forward like this for like two hours just squeezing a toy. He's very he's the most vacant dog I've ever met in my life but that's part of why he's so endearing okay. And I also like that Chloe basically rules the house and he doesn't well not according to YouTube we have that video up already where Patillo hands Chloe her ass it's contentious yeah well not not in this this house not not here in this court of opinion okay.
