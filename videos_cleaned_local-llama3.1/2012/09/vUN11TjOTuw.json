Oh yeah, you you you, it's one of those things that everybody remembers, rap rock from the early aughts, '98, '98. Oh yeah, most people gave it up but you you've held on, you've carried that torch. Why I really like rap rock, I know it's not something to be proud of necessarily, I know a lot of it is uh musically bankrupt and not",

I know a lot of it is uh musically bankrupt and not very you know doesn't really require a lot of talent. There's a lot of bad rap rock bands and those bad rap rock bands ruin the entire genre but there are a handful of good rap rock bands that I really like so um that some of them still make music, some of them don't. And I think it's a genre worth exploring because I really like hip-hop a lot and I really like rock a lot and I don't see why you can't combine the two into something that's great. And and I think if you artists haven't managed to do that who is still doing it well um well I think people some people are alive you're gonna like this but I think with Biscuit when they came back and made Gold Cobra last year yeah it was a really great record and I think that they like totally fell off and I don't understand why people don't like",

I think, yeah, well first to me at home who has no idea what we're talking about, why would people not like Limp Bizkit? I think I think people don't like Fred Durst, yeah, and and I understand that he's my Chocolate Starfish, yeah, yes, of your chocolate of your chocolate flavored water, of course. But he got a like him; he's like a little bit brash, and so with that, I also understand people think that Limp Bizkit musically is actually really good, and I think a lot of people really like Wes Borland who is their guitarist, yeah, very very technically talented guitarist, but when you think I think people are being a little bit hypocritical about rap rock, and it bothers me a little bit because Limp Bizkit has sold millions of records right, a band like Linkin Park when they released Hybrid Theory which",

Everybody was doing it, yeah. I think I think that there's a level of like you know it's cool to hate these things on both sides. I mean, think about like the Bee Gees - right, the Bee Gees are awesome if you're gonna hate on if you're gonna hate on the Bee Gees, you're kind of crazy. I mean they were very disco-centric, you know, group and and they did their thing or whatever even like ABBA - if you listen to like some of ABBA's those songs are awesome, better when they were in the 80s, remember the 80s? Yes, I swear they're Swedish, like... yes, I'm super attractive, yeah, okay, yeah. You enjoyed that, yeah, of course, but yeah back to the topic of rap rock - I think that it will probably come around at some point and I don't think there's anything wrong with enjoying the genre, I understand why",

I understand why people don't like it; I understand that some of the stuff is really corny, some of these guys just totally went off the deep end - they're really what killed rap rock. I mean, I think Limp Bizkit's decline in popularity had a lot to do with the killing of rap rock. Well, let me give you an example of the hypocrisy of what rap rock is. Rage Against the Machine is the most prolific rap rock band of all time - okay, and Rage Against the Machine are really great. I'm a Republican, I'm a conservative, but I really enjoy Rage Against the Machine. I think Tom Morello is awesome; I think Zack de la Rocha is incredibly intelligent individual. I think those are really good songs when they came back and reformed a few years ago, they played",

Yeah, we're doing those things so I think people need to be a little more honest with themselves about the place rap rock has in the industry and rapcore and rap metal all that stuff and understand that it's going to come back eventually okay you heard it here first everybody Colin says \"Eminem\" doesn't everybody out there get ready for a rap rock's return it's coming god wait what you think this video did you like it then like the video share with your friends subscribe to us tweet at us tell Colin what your favorite rap rock song is or leave it in the comments below here in the video and until then check us out every Tuesday and Thursday when I throw a topic at Colin and he catches it with that big mouth of his",
