Mhm, I think the environment will probably persevere. I like the plastic bag. What's up everybody? I'm Greg and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random conversation pile, pull one out, toss it at Colin, and we talk it out for your amusement. Colin has no idea what's in the conversation pile. If you like that idea, like us here on YouTube. Subscribe to us here on YouTube, and then in the comments below make sure you leave your suggestion for a topic. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic is paper or plastic. This one's submitted by Michael Joe. Vote now.

Um, I don't know. So I got a conversation with about about the paper bag conundrum here that I I think began on October 1st of this year on Twitter with some people and a fee like this uh is generated in order to say like we want you to bring your reusable bag, reduce reuse recycle yeah all that garbage and uh Save the Planet Colin, and so uh yeah. So they started to charge you 10 cents a bag in order to kind of you know pretend like they care about the environment but really they just want to raise you know money and they probably prefer in fact that you don't bring your own bag and so they can charge you uh 10 cents now I I spent about $40 uh on my groceries which makes a a a 10 cent per bag tax uh for bags about you know 2% extra tax on my on the money spent, so it's a tax levied against me. I don't really appreciate",

I don't really appreciate, you're not a fan of the taxes like this, no I'm not a fan of taxes in general okay so what are you going to do about it nothing just complain about it just going to keep living here in San Francisco bitching on YouTube that's what I do uh no I I think uh you know back to I guess the question at heart paper or plastic they have their different uses now I understand that plastic bags are bad for the environment mhm I think the environment will probably persevere I like the plastic bag it's very useful in a g you know when we're taking out the litter for instance you got some garbage kind of hanging around you throw it in the plastic bag you throw it out it's totally fine there the plastic bag is heavily reusable you can probably use the plastic bag several times the paper bag uh is",

The plastic bag is heavily reusable; you can probably use the plastic bag several times. The paper bag, uh, is recyclable because it's made of paper, and itself is probably post-consumer paper mostly, so it's already recycled anyway. Now, for argument's sake, you could use you could reuse the paper bag a few times couldn't you? Sometimes that handle gives out; that's what I'm not a fan of when the you're you're walking somewhere and you get the tear in the paper bag never never good. Yeah, I think the you know I think generally you know it's nice to have choices and so you want both available to you for for different things maybe. You buy some you know we go to the vegetable store here down the street a store I'm not a fan of they give you the plastic bag; it makes sense you're carrying your you're carrying your onions and your apples and your tomatoes in it, and it makes a lot of sense.",

It makes sense; you're carrying your onions and your apples and your tomatoes in it, and it makes a lot of sense. And you're a little sack maybe you go and you buy some heavier groceries at Safeway so you want the paper bag. I just don't understand limiting consumer choice based on pretending to care about the environment because I, I environmentalism is good and I care about the environment too. But I think that you have to kind of do it, you know, you have to kind of convince people the right way to go about their business in such a way that that's good for the environment. Is this similar to the whole hotel thing of \"oh man, leave if you want to save the environment\"? Get started on that. Well, we're getting you started right now. It's A Conversation with Colin. Oh man, if you don't want your bed made then put this card on it or whatever and don't leave your TOS on the floor if you want them.",

If you want them recycled, but if not, could you struggle through using a towel two days in a row? I know I hate that because you see that at hotels all the time. But it's just a way for them to save money, and it's the same thing with water bottles. Like, you see a water bottle and they're like, \"This uses 30% less plastic.\" Well, it's like your plastic bill is now lower 30%, but you can pretend like you care about the environment because it saves you money, and also you get to look good by putting on your product like we're very environmental because that's what's chic right now. It's been chic for a while, and that's cool. Being an environmentalist is fine, but like, you know, it seems like people are trying to do it in a way that is self-",
