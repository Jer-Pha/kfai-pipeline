What's your favorite bagel place out in Sub County? What's your favorite bagel place in the city or in Brooklyn or in Queens, and I'm like they're all pretty much much better than anything you'll find in California, yeah. Um, but uh, you know, but the shitty bagels have kind of grown in their power. I mean these Jess up just for these Bagels on the public like they're real Bagels well people don't know right?

Yeah, you know, um I go home and I eat the good Chinese food there and it's **miles ahead** of what's going on here, the bagels are miles ahead of what's going on here, the pizza like in the stratosphere compared to the pizza here which is like somewhere in the **earth's mantle** in comparison. Yeah, well now let's not throw Patsy under the bus, you like a good Patsy pizza I like a good Patsy pizza but that's different okay okay out there just saying it's not as bleak as you make it out there no no I mean if you're looking for Chicago-style pizza you're looking for something like you know Patxi's is is good Pascal's on Haight is really good too you",

Um, when I went home and I had Joe's Pizza, which is my favorite pizza in Brooklyn, New York, man, that stuff is so good \u2013 it's still so good, it is so goddamn good, you know. And the bagels... My favorite Chinese place is called Jing Fong in Chinatown, New York; um, that place is excellent too, light years ahead of whatever the hell is going on in this city. Um, so I'm spoiled. San Francisco's got good Mexican food, oh yeah, I'll give it that. Now here's here's the thing that's weird for me and you don't find weird at all; you're from... I guess I'm raised on just whatever a bagel is \u2013 round, it has the hole in it, I know what a bagel be. You don't put cream cheese on your bagels? No butter? What's that all about?

What's that all about? Um, why don't you like the cream cheese? I don't like cream cheese, but I mean, cream cheese is common; everyone uses cream cheese everywhere. It's that - that's the most popular topping for a bagel, uh, anywhere. I would say, but butter bagels are close second, um, in New York. And I'm surprised when I meet people out here who don't even know that they have never heard of putting butter on a bagel; like, that's just bizarre. I remember the first time I ever brought bagels into work - Hillary and you asked for butter, and I was like, what the hell is your problem? I don't know why would you want butter; it's probably in the fridge, are you going to fry up an egg? I don't know what you need it for. I no, I think butter on a bagel is - it's simple, it's clean, it's it, it brings out that that flavor of the toasted bagel, you know there's",

No one eats egg sandwiches anywhere but in New York; I don't understand like what like egg sandwiches are so like so common that you you order them in a very specific way: two eggs, salt, pepper, ketchup \u2013 you know? You write it down: \"two egs spk\" like if you have to like write it down. I used to work at a deli; that's how you that's how you write it down. Like people were surprised that you put ketchup on a bagel. I remember ordering a bagel sandwich from this one good place by where we work, Great American Bagels \u2013 they have great bagels there and great water bagels. And I ordered a sandwich there and said, \"Can I have bacon, egg, and cheese? Can you put ketchup on it?\" And they had to like take the ketchup packets and like put it on; that's so bizarre \u2013 like that is such a common thing to ask for.",

But I'll tell you right now, I mean, I've traveled the country pretty extensively, um, and no one eats as good as we eat in the tri-state area. Very interesting. Very interesting. Period. Period.

How about ketchup on bagels? I mean, with egg sandwiches for breakfast, sure. Yeah, yeah, when I'm making the egg sandwiches back there in the morning on Sunday with Christine, I usually put ketchup.
