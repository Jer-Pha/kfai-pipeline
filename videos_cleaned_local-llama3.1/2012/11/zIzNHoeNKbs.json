What if I was at home hungry? Now, here we go. Firstly, alright, alright, look, look what we got going here again. They're all here; they're all uniform, no breaks, no split cookies - that's what you want. Let's get a small bouquet, not strong, okay. Either way, that's interesting. Of course, you know on the regular Golden Cookie it was the cookie that really spoke, but right now it seems the chocolate in the cookie here they're cancel each other out. I can't get a good smell. Let's see what I can get in our next segment taste there we go. Now, look at how it looks, okay. Oh, I'm excited about this cookie, know again, the yeah, the outside cookie sugar-ish short British sweet that's what you initially get; let you continue to chew and mull over all the taste in your mouth the chocolate really comes out, I can taste it right now as an advertised - that's dynamite.",

The chocolate really comes out; I can taste it right now as advertised - that's dynamite. I'm a big fan of this one so far. Let's see: up next, of course, how does it pair with milk? A big part of every Oreo cookie. How's the pay with note? Remember last time we had the Golden Oreo on the show; it didn't go well for the milk test because it didn't absorb the milk. You know what the way you want I don't know that's gonna change here, that we have the chocolates on the inside. I'll give her the traditional few dippity-doo dogs here and here, gonna pull it out, see what we got. Yeah, I'm okay; a few extra dippity-do does there come he really took it a soggy cookie still - Auggie's. I think the chocolate cookie would be but then we saw here than the Golden was the first time around so something about the cream maybe the duration of the dippity-doo - but I thought I gave the same one again, really.\"",

So I've just given it an 8.5 again or a 9, giving it a 9 that's right. Snap judgment. The char, the taste is what I'm looking at it and that taste category when I get the chocolate aftertaste I get the nice sweet bread cookie right in front of my tongue it's dynamite for your palate highly recommended 9.0. So that's the way the cookie crumbles for Golden Chocolate Oreos but what do you think? Leave your review as a video response below, like the video, subscribe to my channel and then I need you for the most ladies and gentlemen are there any Oreos out there I'm missing? I'm sure they are. They seem unloved, they don't know that I'm looking for them wanting to consume them and score them in a brutally harsh manner in the comments below please leave any Oreos I'm missing then tell your friends share this video with them. I'll be back every Wednesday and Friday until I run out of",
