If if you thought like here's the thing, ladies and gentlemen, at no point do you need to make this cookie. There is too much frosting taste in here already. Do not do this because then you will just go straight to diabetes mode, and I will have to come to your house and cut off your leg. But let's talk about the final review score of Candy Corn Oreos. I i talk about it a lot. I'm not a fan of super sweet things, overly sweet things, and these are super sweet. But it kind of works. It also is for me personally a deterrent to eating more. I eat one, I eat two, I'm done. I don't need any more Candy Corn Oreos, which is not a bad thing. Real Oreos, I'll say you give me some Very Berry Oreos, I'll sit right now and kill that package in front of you, no regrets. Candy Corn Oreo is going to cut it short. Taste okay, good, good. First look in the packaging don't pair well with milk twisting.",
