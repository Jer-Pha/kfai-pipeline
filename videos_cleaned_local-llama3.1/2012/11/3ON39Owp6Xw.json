Greg, yeah, she has 15 minutes to decide this case; she's got to get through it as quickly as possible. What's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation with Colin. I'm Greg, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at Colin; we talk it out. He has no idea what's in the conversation pile. If you like that, like the video. Subscribe to us here on YouTube, then share it with your friends so they can be part of our conversation with Colin. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is Judge Judy. Oh, submitted by @Jushin on Twitter. So thank you so much. Um, you are obsessed with the one and only Judge Judy. I am. I am. Um, God, Judge Judy. Where do you even begin with Judge Judy? She's a firebrand, is what she is. I love Judge Judy. I think that you",

I think that you know she brings the justice down to the everyday people, Greg. She's uh, you know, she's a mediator; she's not really a judge. I mean, there are a lot of rules that people don't understand about Judge Judy, but well, it explains some of the rules of Judge Judy so... Judge Judy as I understand it might have changed a little bit in terms of money now, but when you go on Judge Judy, Judge Judy takes place in New York and um, people from all over the country go, and so immediately that raises red flags. It's like how could you possibly be going to another state to solve a rental dispute in Alabama or something like that doesn't make any sense. Well, you're basically signing over your rights to the case to a mediator, a mutually agreed upon mediator which is Judge Judy okay um",

It's an awesome gig because that show is syndicated. She also makes a fortune - regardless of that, Judge Judy. When we get down to the cases, she asks all the right questions. Judge Judy delves right into the issue at hand. She doesn't want any ancillary nonsense. Greg, yeah, she has 15 minutes to decide this case; she's got to get through it as quickly as possible. But I really... when I went back to Long Island not too long ago - just a week ago - I was with my good friends. We were smoking cigars in the backyard. We went inside; we turned on the TV, and Judge Judy was on there. Immediately, we just started watching it because it's that engaging; it's that funny.

I mean, you know, I love that Judge Judy is just mean to everyone; she just screams at everyone once in a while. She likes someone very much, yeah. But like, I'm telling you, they walk into the courtroom; she's got preconceived notions about everyone, and whatever is going on it's so **** funny. I love that show; it's so good. That's all I really got to say about her. Okay, that's all we have to say about Judge Judy. Uh, great topic. Uh, Justin, thank you so much. Was there anything else you wanted to ask about Judge Judy? No, you just said it all, I think didn't you? You nailed it. What I mean is she's a sexy grandmother, is what I always think of.

I think I don't think you have to worry though cuz the rules for being accepted by Judge Judy are pretty simple: you show up, call her your honor, and don't interrupt, and don't listen to what her rules are right. Judge Judy is really just a TV game of Simon says because you can make one mistake, you can cross the line once and she'll say \"don't\" you can't speak when the plane is speaking, you go okay and then if you do it again that's when the gloves are off, cat's out of the bag, she's scratching yeah I like the little thing she does, like you have to say yes, yeah she doesn't",
