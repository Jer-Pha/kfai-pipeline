I'm happy that we were there to remind the nation that everyone loves Ben Savage. It's like Happy Days begets Joanie Loves Chachi. Perhaps it's like I hope this is more successful than Jan Loves Chachi, maybe but it's also perhaps like Perfect Strangers giving us Family Matters. There you go, that's more like it. I think all right, all right. Um, yeah, but it's so apparently Disney Channel correct, yes, Disney Channel and also ABC Family they syndicate the Boy Meets World because the Boy Meets World is quite popular even with the Young Millennials. Oh, sure, yeah, yeah, they can all get down with Chubbies. Who doesn't know Chubbies? A good burger, yeah, it's a good burger love affair uh and so this is popular in syndication and so they're thinking about bringing back in the same universe a new show starring the same some of the same characters I don't",

Greg is extremely excited about. I mean it's it's good news because it reminds me a bit of uh the last episode of or the last I guess it was two seasons now Kirby enthusiasm they had the entire fake episode of Seinfeld that they made and and they showed parts of it and they brought everyone back and it kind of gave you um a window into what that show would look like in you know today obviously ended in 1998 we got see in like 2010 2011 so that's pretty exciting. So yes, this is for real, for real, for real. Maybe it's more like Dallas and then the new Dallas, that's a really good reference actually, that's what it's more like than all the dumb things you said yeah the Dallas and then the new Dallas",

Yeah, the Dallas and then the new Dallas. Give me the over/under: Is Feeny back? Yes, yeah. Fen's got nothing to do with it. Yeah, I assume I assume everyone will be back in some respect, even if it's a cameo or like kind of a bit part. Uh, but I I make an assumption that Feeny will be teaching this young man. She has... he has... He's done, you know. Cory graduated, so there's no reason for him to be in college anymore. So he's swung back to go to you know elementary middle school. He he stopped being the dean of college like he was in the end when Boy Meets World ended it series and then he was like, 'You know what? It's time to get back to my roots, get back to teaching.' I I... What if Cory and Topanga have the same house? What if they took over the Matthews estate because something tragic happened to the Matthew's family? Yeah. Well, I mean, I think we all knew...\"",

Speaking of season one of A Conversation with Colin about Jericho coming back on Netflix, we've heard nothing about that. So who knows if this will go anywhere? I I think the reaction of the internet has shown Disney That Girl Meets World has to happen, of course. Ben Savage dusting off his acting chops; he's been he's been resting, he's been waiting for this to happen to go living up with that syndication cash, that's what you got to do. It's got to be fat cash right. I'm sure it's enough to live on. We need to get some of that someday. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, that about wraps it up for the conversation on Girl Meets World.
