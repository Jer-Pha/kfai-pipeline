But that's a tangent. Yeah, much to do with Sarah Palin; it might as well have tomatoes have more to do with rational and coherent politics than Sarah Palin does. Actually, what's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg, and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at Colin, we talk it out; he has no idea what's in the random conversation pile; he doesn't hear it till you do on the show. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to us here on YouTube, and for the love of God, please share this video with your friends. Let them know Colin's crazy and says funny stuff. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is Sarah Palin. This one was submitted on Twitter by Windam83. Sarah Palin; remember her? She",

Sarah Palin, remember her? She was a big thing, yeah. Thought there was a lot talking about her. Well, you start with me. Sarah Palin, let's dial it back even further than anything else, okay? When's the first time you ever really heard of Sarah Palin? You're a Republican; we've talked about it before, link. When have I heard of Sarah Palin? Probably like 2007, okay? When did I know anything about Sarah Palin? Two days before the Republican convention in 2008, probably, okay. Because no one had any idea who Sarah Palin was, yeah. It was weird all of a sudden, right? Like for me, you know, not being dialed into the political community and not being part of the Republican party at all, like you know it was just all of a sudden out of the blue, bam! John McCain's running mate, and it's this woman from Alaska that was crazy. I didn't think that that...",

You know, and she, Sarah P, was embarrassing - she's embarrassing, but why? Okay, so like let's get into the nitty-gritty of it here: so like who would have been a better pick for John McCain as a running mate? The obvious pick was Mitt Romney, but you assume that Mitt Romney said no and you assume that other people said no too because there's no way that Sarah Palin was the first pick or the second or the third or the fourth - like you have to assume that John McCain and his",

There was no way he was going to win. I knew from the word go that he wasn't going to win, no matter who won the primary on the Democratic side, because Obama and Clinton's or Hillary Clinton's primary was quite heated; yeah, that was one of the best primaries ever, yeah, um, but Sarah Palin is just she's the epitome of why people think Republicans are not smart and why they think Republicans",

And it's really about how you carry yourself. Um, Sarah Palin had no business being in a national spotlight at all; she was not ready, and she embarrassed us. You know, I'm very open about having voted for Obama; yeah, I talk about voting for Obama. I did vote for Obama. The reason I ended up swinging against McCain in the LA... you know, at the end, was because he picked Sarah Palin. I'm not going to vote for that ticket. There's no way. She's so unprepared, she's not articulate, she's not intelligent, and that really bothers me. It's still to this day; we're filming this two days before Obama wins re-election or Romney gets elected.",

And uh, you know people still care about what she tweets and Facebooks, and well yeah now she's a big star right? That was where you concerned that she had a shot at being in the primaries for this one, being in 2012 having a shot at being president? No, I wasn't. The one thing no one should ever be concerned about is Sarah Palin being president - because that's never going to happen in a million years. Um, but was I concerned that she was going to get into the race? Yeah, I was concerned just because it's like, no, we don't want you in this; we don't want anything to do with you. You're not articulate, you have no idea what you're talking about. Yeah, and that's okay because most people in this country have no idea what they're...",

Yeah, you know, or vice president at the time she's just she was out of her league and she should have known better and the McCain people should have known better too, that is that was malpractice like McCain should be embarrassed that he let his team pick her; she and like I said she was clearly not vetted. Yeah, you know, so you have to assume that they went really low down on the list. I mean I would have taken almost anyone else in the Rep like... almost anyone else in the Republican party over her. Um has nothing to do with anything. I'm sure she's a nice woman; she I'm sure she has a very nice family but think about the circus that surrounded it, you know Sarah Palin gave us Levi Johnston or whatever",

Um, when was pizza invented or was that a different conversation for coming? Pizza was invented uh, I believe it's actually French. Yeah, but I mean, like, like when, like it wasn't like in the revolution people weren't eating pizza. No, it must have been sometime after the after the colonization in the United States. Tomatoes are American. See this is here's the interesting thing Greg is that tomatoes and potatoes two things that are often associated with Europe Ireland and Italy respectively yeah are both American.
