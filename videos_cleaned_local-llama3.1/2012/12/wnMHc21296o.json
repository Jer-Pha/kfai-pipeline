It took me like a half an hour to get my food without a jerk, never again. Yeah, these people are supposed to be known for efficiency. Greg, you're up. What's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation with Colin. I'm Greg. This is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday we're reaching into my random topic pile, pulling one out, throwing it at him; we have a conversation about it. He has no idea what's on the cards till he hears it. Here if you like that idea, like this episode of A Conversation with Colin, then subscribe to our YouTube channel and then please share with your friends so everyone can see how you waste your time on the Internet. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is McDonald's, submitted by @DRTHENE, and I'm not even trying to pronounce that on Twitter; they're uh, you love fast food, so let's see how he compares the big three.",

They're uh, you love the McDonald's, I do, I do a bit, but you don't go to it all that much anymore. No, you tell me your sordid tale here of love falling in and out of love with McDonald's. I guess I never fell out of love in the Bell... yeah, why? I didn't have you possible right? Let's start with me again, McDonald's in general. Um, I mean I love, I love McDonald's. I mean McDonald's is great. It's not like the best fast food, I think what's the best is Chick-fil-A, okay. Um, interesting choice why is that an interesting choice? Well, you're Joey from Burger... someone else I would say In-N-Out and now it's awesome. No, I love Chick-fil-A, okay. I've only had Chick-fil-A like my college days. My favorite part about going to the South is eating Chick-fil-A. I eat Chick-fil-A even when I went to visit my girlfriend outside of Pittsburgh.\"",

Oh, even when I went to visit my girlfriend outside of Pittsburgh just a few weeks ago, I went to Chick-fil-A like three times, yeah. And of course, are you getting there what do you get in Chick-fil-A? I get the number one, which is this basic chicken sandwich with no pickles, and then two more chicken sandwiches, I get the ones with pickles. I don't like pickles on the chicken anyway. McDonald's is good, I mean, I've been eating McDonald's for a very long time; it's not even my favorite anymore. I've kind of grown to have enough more of an affinity for Burger King actually, but Burger King is like kind of rare out here for some strange reason. So, like, I don't know why Burger King's like a rarity. I think I know, like, there are two Burger Kings, with one in the city and then there's like a gas station one, yeah, which is like an awful burger, yeah. You don't eat there, and then there's like a Burger King in",

So I think they change it up and and you know the numbers are different sometimes go with a quarter pounder sometimes I go with a double quarter-pounder when I had gained all that weight a few years ago and I was like really like almost 200 pounds I would go to McDonald's after work and get a two-cheeseburger meal, extra-large, like supersize, whatever.

And so I'd get it sometimes and I'd have my mom or my dad take the cheese off - that's just the bread with this, yeah, yeah. And then one day we went to get pizza and I accidentally ate... I didn't take the cheese off, and I accidentally ate... I had to slice it, and then I realized that I like pizza. That's the story about how I started eating pizza. How did you accidentally start eating pizza? Like, common conversation, yeah. Think you know that I like this, I like this a lot. Yeah, this is quite good. That was the end of it.

Now, of course, the tie-in to the traumatic story we already talked about on A Conversation With Colin is that one of the most traumatic moments of my entire life happened at a McDonald's, and that was when I accidentally ate mustard, yeah, yeah, I'm like, \"The pizza you didn't like, that was bad.\" Yeah, so I go to meet my mom in Hartford, Connecticut, with my mom, and we don't talk, and they give me this burger. I bite into it, and I'm like, nauseous at the table, all grossed out, and I open it up, and I was like, \"Mustard on my burger,\" like hot mustard is like butter or something, like that.

I'm not gonna go there. Some people do, I don't know if it's why now but I think in the Chicago area they were doing bratwurst for a while. I brought one that I never saw that one, wide I saw pizza.
