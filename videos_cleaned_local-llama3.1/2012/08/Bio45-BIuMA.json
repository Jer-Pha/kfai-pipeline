The Goon was or the Enforcer was basically designed to play only a few minutes a game and he was basically there to make sure that there was someone that could kind of deal retribution to the other team if say one of their star players was victimized by a dirty hit or the other team's enforcer wanted to kind of throw down to get everyone's energy level up or things of this nature. So it was a very specific unskilled position on a hockey team that has kind of evolved into something else more recently. What has it involved into now? More recently there's no there's no roster room really for a player like that anymore, like now like a fourth line",

Is hockey getting too civilized for your tastes? No, I mean I I I I understand why people don't like fighting in hockey and I understand that I understand that most people an interesting thing well I I I I like it and I also understand why it exists um it's",

Um, let me put it this way: if you go on YouTube, you're on YouTube right now, actually. Yeah, but don't click off yet unless you've already liked, shared it with your friends, and subscribed. Uh, but you can find plenty of on-ice brawls and plenty of bench-clearing brawls from back in the day. Um, and a lot of hockey players back then just had a mental and physical toughness where they could kind of take care of themselves, and then that kind of evolved into something that was more uh assigned to a few role players on the team who would take care of the fighting. So um, a player like Marty McSorley on the Kings defended Wayne Gretzky, and Wayne Gretzky wouldn't do his dirty work; Wanye Gretzky did fight every once in a while, um not very often at all, did he fight? Well, no, yeah exactly, pretty boy but.",

No, yeah exactly pretty boy. But like if someone took a shot at Wi Gretzky, Mar Moriarty would punch you in the face so it kind of made you think twice about what you were doing and those players still exist. And actually when the Islanders played the Penguins two years ago and it was the third most penalized game in NHL history that was when the Islanders had brought up all of their like a couple of their goons including Michael Haley who recently signed with the Rangers unfortunately uh they called him Haly in order to fight um and that was because the game previous uh the Penguins got the Penguins' goalie game and the Islanders ended up winning big in that game and also getting on penalties so it's about fighting and goonery in hockey is about cadence, cadence and it's about energy um it's about uh e and flows which is really",

So how does it still exist? Like, why is there still fighting in hockey? Is it always going to be this way? I think it is. I think there's a conflict - hardcore hockey fans understand why fighting is in the game, and they like it. You say it's there because of pace and flow to bring up retribution on people who are you know going after your star players. If you're in a slump, to get you guys riled back right? If you let up a weak goal for instance, the team's down, you're at home, the crowd's not into it, the players aren't into it - you send your goon out maybe the other team sends their goon out, pushing and shoving happens, they start fighting, the crowd's into it, maybe a huge punch is landed.",

I showed you the video and it's hilarious; you can find that video online. It is funny if by this point in a conversation with Colin I've gotten good enough at editing, I will be linking to it right around here. So, so just consider that hockey has a fighting aspect rather than a place in hockey, and the hardcore fans understand it, but it turns off people who don't understand hockey, but they might be into hockey and they're watching it, and it's a great game; it's fast, it's back and forth, it's high-scoring, which I don't like high-scoring hockey, but a lot of people do, and then suddenly dudes are fighting, and they're like, \"Why are these guys just fighting?\" and why are the referees just standing there, yeah, and letting it",

It's well, it's because it's allowed, and there's a place for it. And you saw in the playoffs, because we watched some of the playoffs together, how when a team plays each other six or seven times in a row in a series, how ugly those series get, and how people just fight over and over again, and it gets really gritty and really emotional, because hockey is a really emotional sport, and fighting is kind of one of the conduits by which the emotion is let out. And it has real repercussions, like I've said in the game, so I don't think it's going to go anywhere, but I don't think the NHL itself, that the front office likes fighting anymore because uh it turns off the casual fans that they need to grow the sport, and so I think you're going to see more penalties, I think you're",

I think you're going to see more instigation penalties, which happens when someone instigates a fight, they get an extra two minutes, maybe they get a misconduct, maybe they're kicked out of the game. Um, to decrease fighting but I don't think I think it's ever going to be illegal in the sport and it never should be. Who's the best goon of all time? That's tough. I really like Rob Ray. Um, I think Tyler Ennis is one of the greats because he was small and scrappy. Um, and you can find plenty of footage again on YouTube of him um taunting fans and going crazy. I think he actually went into the crowd and fought a fan once and you you find that took off his skate tried to murder him. I actually think what happened was a dude was taunting him and like leaning on the glass in the penalty box and the glass collapsed and broke.\"",
