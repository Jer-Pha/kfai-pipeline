And he lives next door to the Matthews family and he teaches them middle school and then he teaches them in high school and then they go to college and voila, there's Mr. Feeny. What's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg and this is my roommate Colin. Now Colin sometimes he says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday I go into my topic pile, pick one out, toss it at him. He has no idea what is in the topic pile. This is all happening live here on YouTube. Uh, speaking of YouTube, you like it, subscribe to it, like it on the thing, share it with your friends. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Topic of conversation today is Boy Meets World. Oh, how about The Boy Meets World? I love that show. Why do you love Boy Meets World? I don't really know. I mean, it's it's there's something there's something endearing about the characters that I I really like. But, as you know, I'm also fascinated by the relationship of",

And he lives next door to the Matthews family and he teaches them middle school and then he teaches them in high school and then they go to college and voila, there's Mr. Feeny. He's the dean, right? Or something. The dean or whatever the hell he's doing at the college. A little weird. Yeah. Not really explained thoroughly, but very interesting. But now, see, we can't get caught up on little things like that cuz lots of things in Boy Meets World never explained properly. Remember Morgan went to her room for like two seasons and came back much older. But they did make a joke about that. They made a joke about it. They they they broke the fourth wall on that one.

You got to like that about it. But uh why does everybody get stupider on that show? Uh what do you mean? Like like Eric? I mean like Cory especially. Yeah. Remember how Cory used to be the cool older brother and then he slowly got dumber and dumber and dumber. I think Cory is the best character on the show. He's No, cuz he gets so dumb at the end. He's so funny though. Like he's a he's a funny like foil. Why Why is he a funny foil? Um because he I I first of all I think that like the the interplay between him and his parents is really are really funny. I think when he gets older and like they're just like in this college situation that like it does get a little out of control. It's kind of like uh Stifler in American Pie 3. Oh my god. Stifler gets so uh when he gets like a little over but then like you",

Scott Stifler gets so uh when he gets like a little over but then like you know in the fourth American Pie movie they kind of bring him back in. Um, they never really had a chance to do that with Eric Matthews and I understand what your concerns with him, but they never had a chance to do that in like the nine seasons they were on the air because they thought they were gonna have that 10th season where they were gonna kind of wrap it all back in and make it so Eric wasn't stupid. Yeah. It didn't come together. No. Uh, did you ever hear this rumor that Eric was going to kill himself? Wait, like the character? Yeah. No, I heard a rumor that uh that he was going to kill himself in an episode they were going to do like a really serious drama episode one time. Really? Yeah. So, he was it was slowly building up where he was getting more and more depressed in a season. I",

So, he was it was slowly building up where he was getting more and more depressed in a season. I haven't seen the seasons in forever, probably since they were originally up there. Or, you know, we catch the we catch the TNT runs, reruns or whatever. And at one point, he went up in at a party. He went upstairs and uh he was supposed to kill himself there, but they decided that that was too dark for the show. This is a true story that I heard. I've done no verification on it. No verification on it. Someone will have to check that. If we find it, we'll annotate it. I like I like that. That would have been a nice turn. I wouldn't have wanted to see that character go. I would have, but it it would have given the show more depth because you figure the later seasons of Boy Meets World. They're they're just There's just they're in college. They've got Cory and Shawn, not even Joey, the other one.",

They've got the the Lawrence kid, not even Joey, the other one. They got the redhead for some reason that Eric and Joey Lawrence's brother want to have sex with. She's cute, though. She's real cute. Yeah. Yeah. You got Topanga and Cory. They're getting married. I remember there's one episode where she cuts her nails and flicks it into his face or something. I don't Yeah. I don't I don't uh I don't understand what was really going on in the later season. I think that show might have lasted a little bit too long because we knew Cory and his and his and his story from a very early age. He's a young Phillies fan. He's lives in the Philadelphia suburbs. He goes to the school, his teacher, happens to be his neighbor. All this kind of And then it kind of just spawns into something that's like a little more unwieldy and that really had no direction.

And I'm not really sure at what point because I haven't seen him like you. I haven't seen it sequentially in such a long time where that happened specifically, but I do think Boy Meets World is one of the special shows that was on in the 1990s. TGIF. Yeah, it was. And it wasn't a late TGIF show because of course the classic TGIF is Perfect Strangers and Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step, etc. and so on. This was kind of a later TGIF show. This was the more kid-friendly TGIF. Perfect Strangers doesn't play super well to kids. I watched it. I didn't really understand what's going on with Balki. But of course, Perfect Strangers is important in the grand scheme of things because Perfect Strangers spawned Family Matters. See, that's and I know you know that, but a lot of people don't know",

See, that's and I know you know that, but a lot of people don't know that Family Matters is a spin-off of Perfect Strangers. And without Perfect Strangers, having been on TGIF, this Miller Boyett production stream of shows that we knew in, you know, from Full House to Valerie, which later became The Hogan Family, and on and on. Uh we would have never had Family Matters, which was a staple of TGIF. And so, you know, one begets the other, Greg. And we could have almost never had Urkel. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. See, and that's the big thing is even looking at that one, right? All these shows start off so normal and then by the end Urkel is Stefan jumping around and he's got a robot and like even Boy Meets World, remember there was early on really serious threads of Cory's like drunk dad and how he'd have to go live with Mr. Feeny which was a weird choice",

Mr. Feeny was cool though. I like Mr. Feeny. I always wanted him to be my teacher. Like a guy like that. Yeah. Yeah. Why not? See, I think that was it. You're talking about the turning point when Mr. Feeny's disappeared from the show. That was like when they were done being serious. That was maybe the turning point is what you're trying to say. I like that. That's where we're going to stop. Well, Colin, I think that's an excellent conversation. Good job. We're getting better at these. Unless this is the first one.
