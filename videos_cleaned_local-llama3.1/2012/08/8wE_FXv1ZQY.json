But man, they were getting their clock cleaned in the 90s, and they were making terrible devices like the Newton, and all this stuff that no one wanted. And um, he was a visionary behind you know, let's have all you know, like almost another Macintosh with you know, iMac, and let's do the iPod, and let's see the iPhone and the iPad. I mean, like you know, he was the visionary behind those things, and that's great. But when you study him in the 70s, um, there are so many awful stories about him that I think you can't help but kind of look at him a little bit dubiously, and I can regale them, please do this is your conversation, so uh, one story that is really fascinating to me is um Steve Jobs went to Xerox PARC (not zerox), had uh, a lot of people don't know",

Please do this is your conversation so uh one story that is really fascinating to me is um Steve Jobs went to Xerox PARC (not zerox), had uh a lot of people don't know Xerox owned something called PARC, which was in Silicon Valley and Xerox was basically just giving them unlimited amounts of money to just build whatever they wanted. And Xerox PARC made something called the Xerox Alto, which is really the first personal computer. It um had color graphics, it used the GUI (graphical user interface), uh had Ethernet, they were sending email, they had a laser printer, and all these things that no one had any idea what the **** was. And Xerox certainly had no idea what it was. They even invented the mouse. One of the famous stories about that is Xerox went to New York in the 70s with the mouse and was like 'We made this thing called The Mouse, and we want you to look at it.'\"",

That's just one of the many stories. Of course, another story is that Steve Jobs used to work at Atari, and Steve Jobs was tasked with creating games like Breakout for Atari 600, and he had Wozniak help him with the game. If he could get it on as few chips as possible, they would give him a bonus to make manufacturing costs as cheap as possible, and Wozniak was a genius, so Wozniak made it on like ridiculous, you know, just made the board so small and so compact, and Steve Jobs got a like a windfall from Atari, then lied to Wozniak about how much money he was paid and gave him like $500 of the money, um while he promised to split the bonus with them. So why did Wozniak keep working with him? Um, I think Wozniak was like a little bit naive, but I also think Wozniak was altruistic. I think that",

I think that there's like a lot of you know he had an affair with a woman, um, and basically neglected her for 15 years named Lisa, but totally ignored her, pretended that she didn't exist. Like he's just not a good guy, and when you read Walter Isaacson's biography, like he doesn't hold back. So do you think I mean you know when Steve passed not too long ago it was very much this like whole like giant worldwide grieving thing and stuff did he make up for it in the end? Like we keep talking about this stuff in his past did he eventually acknowledge Lisa, he did start taking care of her and stuff like that. Yeah, I think that like when first of all I recommend everyone read the book, Isaacson's is absolutely fascinating.",

It's absolutely fascinating. Walter Isaacson's like a really brilliant biographer, and he had unlimited and unprecedented access to Steve Jobs, especially when Steve Jobs was dying, and that's when he was saying like for those two years when he was just saying everything that he needed to say, and I think that he was trying to redeem himself. But um, think that the proof is going to be in the pudding specifically about how Apple in the next five or 10 years survives without him because I think the story is going to be written about him how much of a visionary he really was if Apple starts to tank, sure, um, because Apple was great with him and then fell off the planet, he came back, they were great again, and now we're in this period where you know with Tim Cook and all these guys where we don't really know what they're going to do next.",
