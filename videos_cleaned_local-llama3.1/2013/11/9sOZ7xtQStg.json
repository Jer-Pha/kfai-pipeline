Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at them, and we talk it out for your amusement if you like that. Like the video, subscribe to our channel, share us with your friends. Are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is 24-hour cable news channels from @MooreSaiyan. How do you feel about them? They're fine; they're interesting. CNN sucks. I think that they... I think that you like Fox. No, actually. Like I said, I watch MSNBC. You do watch MSNBC, why do you watch MSNBC though to antagonize myself? Doesn't watch it for any kind of news gathering information. I think you originally told me you did it to keep one eye on the liberal agenda. Yeah, no... I got to keep... got to keep one eye on the liberal agenda. Right, right, right, right. No, I I",

No, I watch...I don't watch Fox News. Everyone's like, \"Well, go watch more Fox News.\" Like, I don't watch Fox News. I know how I feel. Yeah, I don't need to like watch someone like re-reassess the way I feel about things, even Fox News though. I don't think they reassess how you feel most. No, but I mean like they're...yeah, yeah. I mean like, yeah. Now with that said, I read Drudge Report every day and Hot Air and stuff like that - those are conservative news sites. But I like watching MSNBC because A) I like some of the people on there; like I like Chris Matthews and I like Rachel Maddow a lot. I think Rachel Maddow is super smart. Rachel Maddow is a road scholar, she's not a dummy. Yeah, and I respect that. Um, you know, as opposed to like Sean Hannity who barely graduated high school.",

Go read about the Boston Massacre in Boston in 1770 and read those newspapers and say how straight news they were. Give me a break. Like it's always been that way \u2013 the news has always been tainted by perspective. And that's okay because you know news is factual, and you read the AP or Reuters, and it's like, \"This happened today, blah blah blah.\" It's boring. That's cool, yeah. And I read the AP every day; I read the AP every day for 45 minutes on the train, both to work and on the way back. That's all I read; that's all I do is listen to music and read the AP. Yeah, some AP you're all set, yeah. And like because that's like giving you this is what happened today in Rwanda, this is what happened today in Washington, this is what happened today in",

Like, why did the Cincinnati IRS office do this, and like, what does that mean? Where did these people come from, and like, what kind of perspective illustrates the way they feel about these conservative groups? That's the stuff that's really interesting to me. It's like it's like reading history. My old history professor used to tell me this is a common thing in history when you study it. History is 10% facts and dates and 90% interpretation of those facts and dates, and so I know that Yorktown happened in 1781, but why was Yorktown important? I could study the columns and like see how the units fought each other, but why did they fight like that, and why did Washington beat Cornwallis, and how did that happen, and what were the repercussions of that, and how did that lead to the Treaty of Paris.",

So it's very much informed by how I feel about history. So do you think part of the problem is that people, Average Joes, aren't reading the AP they're just going to MSN or Fox and then saying that that is the news? Sure, that they're getting a skewed perspective and taking it as fact, fact, fact, fact. That's a problem. But I think people need to know what they're getting themselves into because I don't think MSNBC or Fox News portray themselves as being like the dirty, raw news. Like I don't think MSM is fair and balanced - that's a Fox thing. The thing about well, I'll get to Fox in a minute but like the thing with MSNBC is like they their whole thing is \"lean forward\" it's like a total nod to them being left-wing you know",

You know, like Lean Forward, like, don't lean right, don't lean left, down the middle way. They mean I'm saying that's how they spin it when they talk about it, that's not what it means. Like you know, like when and their commercials are all about if you watch their commercials with like uh Lawrence O'Donnell or you know Chris Matthews, whatever, it's all about how conservative ideas are bad. Like, that's all their commercials - \"we attack Social Security\" but this is what blah, like it's all like they don't hide it. And like so when people give MSNBC a hard time I understand, MSNBC has no viewers and like they're tanking, but like they are what they are. And I think with Fox News, I think Fox News is more",

But when you have people like Sean Hannity, um, on there, great of ancestry is another great example of a person who has really no agenda, but when you have someone like, um, John Stossel, or, or you know, who's like a hardcore libertarian, I love John Stossel, so like when you have those kinds of guys, I understand why that people think that about them, but actually, I think Fox News is actually a lot more fair.",

And even people who watch something like Brian Williams on MSNBC or NBC News every night on your regular channel, like your regular NBC channel, it's like 7 million people. Think about all the people that are not watching anything at all, not reading the news. IGN is a huge site; we have millions of readers. We're by far the biggest video game website in the world. There are websites like that, like Drudge Report. Right, Drudge Report has you know millions of readers too. Drudge Report is bigger than IGN, right? But that's still a really small amount of people per capita. In other words, there's just a huge group of people in America, a majority of people in the United States are not reading news at all, not watching news at all.",

Let us know in the comments. Then leave your suggestion for future conversations with Colin. We'll be back every Tuesday and Thursday, so like subscribe, share, and have a conversational day. Andrew Jackson is just crazy. Also, there's another great story about Andrew Jackson: he used to let people into the White House a lot of presidents used to do that for parties and stuff like that, and a dude walked up to him; an assassin walked up to him and tried to kill him, and had two pistols, and both the pistols jammed, and Andrew Jackson beat the **** out of him.",
