And uh, I, I check in there and I'm, I go upstairs and I'm so excited; it's like, you know, it's Thursday night or something, it's already probably already Friday morning, it's after midnight, and I'm like, \"I'm going to go to bed; I'm going to wake up and have a 9 o'clock call time.\" Because what we're going to do rather than just go interview Dan is that we're going to run around all the Ghostbusters locations in New York. We're going to go to the Firehouse, we're going to go to the public library, we're going to go then meet Dan here and think we're going to do all this different stuff have a great time for real. Come here, what are you doing? So it's nine o'clock call time; I'm super excited; it's already midnight the night before. I try to go to bed; I can't sleep; I get back up; I'm, I'm so...",

I try to go to bed, but I can't sleep. I get back up - I'm so stoked that I'm finally going to be in New York City for a Ghostbusters event. I'm going to meet Dan Aykroyd. I decided, you know, screw it; I'll unpack everything right now because I'm already awake longer than I want to be. So that when I wake up in the morning, I'll be able to shower, throw on, get up, meet my cameraman, run around New York City. And so I lay everything out, and I realized I did not pack a black T-shirt. Now I will be goddamned if I'm going to go meet Dan Aykroyd about Ghostbusters and have a blue t-shirt on underneath my Ghostbusters jumpsuit. Everybody knows Ghostbusters wear black T-shirts under their jumpsuits - it's canon. There's something you can't do so anyways now it's like 12:30, and I call the front desk of the W, and I'm like, \"Bro, do you guys sell t-shirts here? I forgot.\"",

I run out into the streets of Manhattan. I find this Walgreens, go in, no T-shirts. Find the CVS, no T-shirts. I'm looking around; it's like I'm buying Time Square. I'm expecting there to be like the all-night T-shirt shop. He's sitting there, asleep. Can't find one. Finally, I'm like, \"I will go to bed. I will wake up in the morning. I'll set my alarm even earlier. I'll wake up and I'll run through the streets of New York trying to find a black T-shirt.\" 9:00's the call time; I set the alarm for like 7:30, shower, get ready, then I run out into the streets trying to find it. Can't find anything anywhere. Nobody's selling T-shirts now. The W does have a gift shop also not open - that was selling black T-shirts. So I don't understand why they couldn't have opened it for me the night before, but whatever; still not open now can't help me at all. Finally, I find a Hallmark.",

Finally, I find a Hallmark store and for some reason New York runs weird hours, so rather than opening at 9:00, they opened at 8:45. So I line up outside of this Hallmark store - just me, so not much of a line. Door opens, I run inside; they have T-shirts. I run to the aisle and there are two T-shirts that are black. One is \"What happens in New York City stays in New York City,\" and I'm like, \"That's too clich\u00e9; everybody knows that's Vegas.\" I'm not going to support them riding the coattails of Vegas on this shirt ($70). I demand a recount now. The shirt is right next to 40 (\"Over the Hill\") and 50 (\"Loving It\"). I'm wearing your grandfather's T-shirt - this is a joke shirt you would buy for your grandfather on his 70th birthday, like, \"Man, Grandpa, you sure do love being 70.\" So I buy it; again, didn't matter.

He gives me a bottle of that Crystal Head vodka. \"Dynamite young man,\" that Dan Aykroyd. He's got a future in this business. Talk to him though, you know? It's great. I had the shirt; it all came together, of course, at the event they gave me a Ghostbusters shirt that was black, and I was like, \"Could have done with this last night.\" But there's nothing I could do about it now. The funny thing is the bow on... The Dan Aykroyd story, of course, is that I knew that this was a great shirt; then this shirt now had purpose, so that when I wore it, I always had a story. So when I knew people were going to ask what does that shirt mean, and I get launching this great story about you know Dan Aykroyd and running around New York and the guy with the polo.",
