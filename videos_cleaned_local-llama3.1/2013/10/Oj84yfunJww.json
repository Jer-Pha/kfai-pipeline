What's up everybody, Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg Miller and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff, so every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at him, we talk it out for your amusement if you like that. Like the video, subscribe to our channel, share it with your friends. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is: If Colin became president, what would he do for this country? Submitted by Chris Bloch. Thanks, Chris. First things first, get rid of that Congress so I can be an actual dictator. You're gonna be king, no one... uh, I would um, the President doesn't have a lot of power, so you'd have to hope that I was elected with a like-minded House and Senate, and then uh, and then we would get down to business. Let's say it happens; what do you want to do? What are you going to do to this country? Uh, the first thing that I would do is try to...",

Uh, the first thing that I would do is try to um roll back the entitlement programs, uh, in a sense that so entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security - not to get rid of them because we can't get rid of them now, like practically, in terms of like libertarian principle, like I don't believe these programs should really exist. Yeah, but to like they exist and people really like really a lot of people that don't like them deny the fact that people depend on them and like set up their whole lives and anticipation in them, like Social Security which is you know 80 years old now or Medicare which was in the mid-60s this isn't like a new thing where you can like take it away from someone now.

Um, okay, that would make the situation a lot more solvent for the people down the road because like we're paying into these systems now, that that might not be there, certainly at this rate, not going to be there. So the one thing Portillo shut it, the one thing that we uh we brought we broke out these beef sticks right where we shot now now P's on Cloud9 running around here. The one thing that we don't like to talk about is um that we have systemic problems with these entitlement programs that need to be taken care of and and I feel like we either deal with them now when we can kind of deal with them in a way that best suits us, a series of bad situations or just let the situation play itself out. It's going to be worse, yeah, but if we let it play it out, it'll be just like the bank thing right where at the last second government steps in.\"",

Okay, so we have to do something about that. Raising payroll taxes to pay for it is not acceptable - I mean, we already pay way too much in payroll taxes. So, one thing I would want to tackle is taking care of our older senior citizens, but we just can't do it until 75; you've got to figure it out. With life expectancies going up so much, there are people that retire - back in the old days, especially in private companies, you could have retired at 50 or 55. There are people that are 90 years old that have been retired for 35 years, and on Medicare and Social Security for 25",

There are people who are 90 years old and have been retired for 35 years, receiving Medicare and Social Security for 25 years. When Social Security was created in the early 1930s, life expectancy wasn't 80 years old; we've never adjusted it to correspond with increases in scientific and medical advancements that save lives. Medicare was a product of the 1960s, when we wanted to take better care of elderly people who couldn't afford their medical care, even though medical care was expensive back then. I'd want to address those issues, but also get our taxation and spending problems under control; we spend too much money on things like foreign aid which we have an enormous amount of money for",

They lost, and this war was useless; the line never moved more than like 15 miles, like the front line of the battle. It was a total waste of time, and a bunch of people died, and gas attacks, and trench warfare - it's some bad stuff. But this resulted in the Treaty of Versailles, in which Germany was blamed rightfully so for the war and had to pay reparations. And I almost look at our situation as having them know they had to pay for it, and they couldn't pay for it, and they didn't know what they were going to do. The situation they did was they printed money to pay for their debts, hyperinflated their money to the point where if you walked into a caf\u00e9 to order coffee and then sat down and drank it, and then went to pay for it, it would cost more by the time you went and...",

The only way out is to do something like really self-injurious, like print money. You'd never get elected because you'd be saying we have to take the hurt now - nobody wants that.

I think like you know everyone like well what about defense? What about all the... yeah, cut defense by 50% whatever. We spend more than the next 10 countries combined on our military, you know.
