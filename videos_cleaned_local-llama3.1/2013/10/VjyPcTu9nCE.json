That was submitted by my mom. I hate being tickled. I hate it. Oh God, why do you hate it so much? I... this is one reason. Why did you scream like I was going inside you? Is the better question, I think. Oh God, I'm so sensitive about being tickled. Why Cheryl knows, like even if you touch me in certain places, like very delicately touch, like I can't be touched, like on my chest or stomach, like just normally really... I can do it myself, but if someone",

But if someone else does, it makes me want to jump around - I hate it. So here's an interesting story: I thought I was going to tickle you, but you wouldn't react and we would end the episode. Little did I know, you'd scream like a hot poker. One of the things that I hated being tickled when I was a kid is my sisters and brother used to tickle me and tease me or whatever. Yeah, and uh, I used to have recurring nightmares about a monster called the Tickly Monster when I was a kid who would come into my dreams; he was a man with a handlebar mustache. This is the most messed up part of it all: we had these portraits in our kitchen - my dad and mom collected antiques, so they were old hand-painted things.",
