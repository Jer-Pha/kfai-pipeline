Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff, so every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at him, and we talk it out for your amusement. I hit the thing if you like that, like the video, subscribe, share it with your friends. Col are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is the perfect boob size and the perfect dick size. This is from Walky 407. To be clear, Walky only asked about boob size, but I thought that was a bit... no, we're going to cover all of it at once, you know what I mean? Dick size, boob size, let's go. What do you, what do you got to say about that? My answer is whatever gets the job done. Okay, I've seen beautiful small breasts; I've seen beautiful big breasts; I've seen beautiful small dicks; mine; I've seen beautiful big dicks. Colin's right, that's how it goes around. I'm half Italian and all the Italians down there",

I know you gotta compensate somehow. Uh, so the I agree. I think it's all it's all relative right? Yeah, I've seen beautiful small perky breasts. Yeah, like... You smile totally. This is such an awkward... most pervy smile I've ever... I've seen beautiful small perky boobs. Uh, but I've also seen uh large bulbous sloppy breasts that have you know that are that are bigger and so you know bigger is often better for a lot of men right? But but I don't agree in that case. I think that it's I think that it depends on on the woman, the the size of the woman, the stature of the woman uh uh I think there's a fine line and also person preference yeah yeah I think like you know like it's not",

Uh, when you were a kid, I mean has your dick always been so big that you don't have to worry about it or were you ever concerned like oh man maybe I have a small dick?

Like, it's not just, \"Whatever, here's my dick,\" and she's like, \"It's a small dick.\" I'm like, \"Get out of here. No one will hear you cry.\" That's never happened, that's what I'm saying. I'm not like... but yeah, I think if you're for the people at home who are worrying about your dicks or your breasts \u2013 also really creepy \u2013 when I look at the camera in the back there's a dad and his children looking out the window. But anyways, I don't worry about it. I say, \"Don't worry about it.\" I think you've got to work with what you've got, and... you know, I think that especially with a man's penis, it's more about how you use it to make\n\nNote: I corrected phonetic mistakes (e.g., \"cryz\" -> \"cry\"), spelling errors (none found), and capitalized proper nouns like names and places.

Well, as we all know for most of the things you read about online or whatever, it's not even straight sex usually; vaginally, I only talk about heterosexual sex. Real deep in here, well, I mean vaginal penetration usually isn't what leads to an orgasm for a female; you usually have to get down and use your hands, face, do some stuff \u2013 do a good job with your face. Just gotta get in there. I don't know how to do that either. Someone directed me to a conversation about sex because I don't know what I'm doing.

But she probably wouldn't know that because in my eyes, she thinks these models are the perfect specimen of what a woman's form should be. And I think both sexes don't realize that the other sex or the same sex - if you're a homosexual person, whatever - actually want something that's a little more normal and a little more like girl next door, guy next door kind of thing, opposed to this thing where you have huge tits or you're a huge dick.
