This is Burnie; he runs this thing called Rooster Teeth. It's a big deal. I don't run it anymore. Yep, you're in charge. You're the one employee Matt Hullum is our CEO now. I was CEO. Make up names too, like 'n years dude' - years the grind and now you're out; you're golfing all the time. That's exactly what it is for me now. Oh okay, no, I'm not creative director. So that means I'd like to work on upcoming projects, stuff like that. And you, like it? You're still doing Red vs Blue. You're still talking on that; you're still a voice on that. Yeah, we actually thought this uh season 11 of this year we have a new writer and director, Miles Luna, and he's been doing that so it's the first time we've ever had anyone besides me write a season.

I love that style of entertainment and you know, going through your whole cancer and staying on camera the whole time was I think that was tremendous. Yeah, hats off. Hey, you still wearing your hat? But nobody does uh what we do here is we answer questions every Wednesday and Friday usually it's just me but you're here Jeriah King writes and he says my question is what suggestions do you have for anyone starting their first podcast? You do the podcast there's the RoosterTeeth podcast, it's also incredibly successful always right in front of podcast be on there on the iTunes rankings sometimes that happens sometimes that happens.

And it was when I finally got there, I said, \"Why did you hire me this time?\" And they said, \"You finally had experience.\" I'd spent six months of my final six months, it turned out, writing for a paper doing a weekly column and a daily blog. And it was like, \"You finally showed that you could write consistently about stuff.\" So now when people ask me, I tell them that. But I also say, start making YouTubes, start making podcasts, and just do it. It doesn't matter if you're not in it for views right now; you're not in it for Twitter followers. You're in it to get good at it. And so that when we bring you in for an interview at IGN, right, you can come on camera and be like, \"What's up everybody blah blah blah blah blah blah,\" and be nailing it.

That's something you'll realize when you sit down at a mic and you do it for the first time. You'll realize just how hard it is. Oh yeah, it's a craft like anything else, and you've got to hone it. That's why the time isn't wasted; you're honing your craft. Yeah, so yeah, get going, get doing it. Sit on them till you're ready to go until you think you have something if you want or just start putting them out there. It's the internet, YouTube's just garbage - people send things there to die every video game sends things up, jeez. 100 hours of footage is uploaded every minute, yeah, over 4 days, every single minute on YouTube it's a lot, it's a lot.
