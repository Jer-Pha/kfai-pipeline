You tweet me a question, you leave it in the comments below or you send me a video response, and I answer it here in front of dozens of YouTube viewers. Today's question comes from \"Bless The Music TV.\" Let's see what he/she/it has to say. All right, Greg, I think I have the perfect question. If you can't answer it, I'll give you a secondary option. Heads up: if you say you have the perfect question and then give me an immediate out, probably not the perfect question. The first question is, who's your top five favorite people at IGN? And I guess why I'd explain the reason. Do you have coworkers? I'm not going to be like, \"Oh man, these are the five I like, everybody else get the **** out of here.\" Number one, Sam Clayborn. If you can't answer it or you want to play the dad card or I love all my kids equally kind of thing, then what's your top five favorite moments?",

Now it's worth pointing out of course what I'm driving at here is the four of us, we were drunk; Clemens was still sober, he didn't come out, he's staying in his room, and so now he's putting up with all of us being a bunch of idiots in his room hanging out, we're all being loud and obnoxious or whatever, and Colin always tells the story of the moment he thought he killed Dave Clayman when he like basically bent down and grabbed Clayman at the legs and lifted him up and then just let go and so Clayman just went completely over his back and fell down; he got up, he was fine, no broken neck like we were concerned but in the middle",

But in the middle of this, for some reason I forget what it was, believe it or not my memory is kind of hazy that night. Uh, we called Chris Roberts and left a message basically that uh things had gotten out of control that night and Clement had broken a window, or that uh no, we had like claimed it had broken a window and that Clement was in the bathroom spinning in a circle vomiting, and we thought it was the funniest thing in the world. And then forgot all about it, and I kind of passed out in the bed and just laid there. It turned out that Chris Roberts did not think this was a joke, so he got out of seeing the movie at midnight, and so it's like you know 2:30 in the morning or whatever because Christopher Nolan loves the long films, and uh he gets the message and he comes back just furious, just so furiously angry and he throws",

The way the crowd reacted to that and the way everybody flipped out was just awesome. That was like one of those experiences, like just wow, we're so so lucky to have this all right. So for a fourth one I'm going to say the Ghostbusters story with Dan Aykroyd. Now here's the whole thing, I'm not going to tell you the Ghostbusters story with Dan Aykroyd it involves this shirt, it's a really good story but it's kind of long and it should probably be its own video. I don't I don't see why I'm wasting all my video ideas in one video right so I'll do that soon enough and then I'll come back and I'll I'll link the shirt but the first day this goes live it won't be so somebody remind me Ghostbusters story Dan",

And it was like it was just one of those crazy like races against the clock. And like this story doesn't sound much better being told, but it was fun, it was a good time. We got... I got there in time. Now the interesting thing is this guy knew the package and misdelivered it, but he still opened it, which I thought was super weird. Don't do that if you get somebody else's mail, don't open it. And he's like, \"Oh, it's games.\" He didn't of course think that it was a huge unreleased game that was a really big deal. But whatever.
