I got into the Jets when I was younger, like in Middle School, and uh, they play at MetLife Stadium, which is on Long Island, but they're also Giants fans and Jets fans in the city and stuff, so doesn't really matter.

And actually, I was like a big Sharks fan when I was a kid. A lot of people don't know that too because um, I really loved Evgeni Nabokov who was their goalie at the time. So like I had like a West Coast team and an East Coast team. And then when I got into high school, I was like, \"He wasn't on the team anymore.\" And I was like, \"You know, now my allegiance is totally with the Isles again\" and stuff like that. It was easier too because they were an expansion team right? Yeah, when like NFL expansion started to pop up and like the Patriots... you know what I mean? Sorry, the Jaguars and Panthers.

Like, people slowly come out and infect others. She's really excited; she's moving back here 'cause she was on an internship; she's a doctor now, and um, she's coming back, and she was like, \"Are you not going to be in Japan for opening week?\" I'm like, \"No, no, no.\" She's like, \"Yeah, I'm really looking forward to watching that opening game,\" and I'm like, \"I'm not.\" But but yeah. The Jets love the Jets. You know, I love them because I know in my heart they're never going to win the Super Bowl again, you know? Like, they're never going to win like that; that's okay.

I was like, \"Oh, you know, they're turning into the Buffalo Bills of the championship game.\" Right? Um, well, that was the thing with the Bears right when I was watching you know I when the Bears made the Super Bowl I drove in to Chicago to be downtown and my thought process was if they win I get to be part of this huge celebration if they lose I'll be around other depressed bears but I'd gotten my job at IGN literally a couple days before that so I was on cloud nine, so I don't even remember the Super Bowl hurting.
