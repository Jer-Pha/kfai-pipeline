Exactly he went to... yeah he went to college uh he's a great football player there yeah um I you know James Polk made a one-term pledge before he ran yeah and stuck to it. He could have gotten reelected and he didn't. I was really really why did he only want to run? Why do you only want to be it was supposed to be like... like you know we've had a bunch of two-term presidents. Keep in mind that the first seven presidents of the United States, six of them were two-term presidents, only one of them um well actually that's not true yeah no two of them out of the first seven or one-term president so it would be Adams and John Quincy Adams okay but Washington Jefferson Madison Monroe and Jackson were all two-term presidents. Um I think it was more of an oath like I'm here I have a plan I want to do something and I'm going to get the hell out of here\"",

And he stuck to that which I thought was kind of neat, you know when you read about him um that he wasn't there to be realized in Polk. Kind of neat, yeah there you go. Why do you think it's cool like he wasn't there to be like a career politician and he could have easily gotten re-elected. I think he actually would have died in the second term um he did die I think a few years after his his uh his term was up but um yeah I think he was an interesting person. I think they're I think the more lesser-known presidents that were terrible are more interesting than or lesser known presidents that we're good, a lot of people don't know about some of the terrible presents uh ZGAMER it's Polk congratulations now Game Over Greggy wants to know about a terrible president uh how about James Buchanan what",

You get up there, you got all these lobby groups plugging up Congress and everything else, the Senate and whatnot. You can't give me past the House Representatives, all screwed up, nothing works, that's caution doesn't work. It's kind of the idea that the executive is like... for instance Obama's just like done, like no one cares about Obama anymore, like he's just a lame duck, like no one gives a **** what he has to say about anything, like that's kind of the way the founders envisioned it, yeah, like the House and the Senate are where the power is, and I feel like that is like going back to the way it was intended as opposed to like a more imperial presidency as they call it, you know.
