We're reviewing Birthday Cake Oreos. This is we've been getting Oreo Orations on the air for a while now since episode one; people talking to me about these damn Birthday Cake Oreos and I'm like, \"That's great! I can't find them anywhere.\" People started sending them in, and then I'd get them \u2013 I get this broken-down, broke-ass package of Birthday Oreos. Like okay, great what?

They're a little bit broken. I'm not going to fault them for that. Oh, they got a good texture to them. They got a good... I can feel the ridges on them. I enjoy that in an Oreo texture. All right, so uh next part of the oration, of course, taste overwhelming smell. Let's see how that affects the taste. Bus, whoa! It's whoa! You gotta ask Greg how much you like cake frosting, like you know if you took the little Pillsbury thing and you... you scoop it up.",
