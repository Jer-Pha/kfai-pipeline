I'm Greg Miller, and while you were out living your life basking in the sunshine or whatever state you live in, the fine people at Nabisco were making endless variations of Milk's Favorite Cookie. So every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like the video and subscribe to my YouTube channel today. We're reviewing Oreo Cakesters. Well, they got out of my hand; there are so many. This is not at all what our normal Oreo Oration goes like. Right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll stick to the same pattern. First look: where you gotta open it up and see how they're packaged and stuff. Well, this is actually impressive already. Look at that - they're all lined up in a little conga line of Oreo cakers. We'll get right into one; they're prepackaged. If I really wanted to, I bet I could go out and sell these on the street. I won't; that's probably frowned upon. Two cakes in every",

If I really wanted to, I bet I could go out and sell these on the street; I won't do that, that's probably frowned upon. Two cakes in every package, if you're wondering. Crack it open now. I guess we're into a real first look. You got a little bit of a gooey, gooey open there - I'm not a fan of anything I open that's immediately gooey like that, but whatever. And then we're going to open them up. Wow, well look at these guys; the first look continues: they're gooey on the sides, Oreo-looking. It's you know basically trying at home to make an Oreo - you make an Oreo cake, you put them together, and this looks like all we're going to jump right into taste now. See how these little guys taste. I was expecting not to like them, but I would say I want to go as far as saying I like them; I want to eat them again. But you remember SnackWell's - these SnackWell's cakes were a big thing back in the day; the makers of fat-free.",

The makers of fat-free SnackWell's Devil's Food Cookies apologize for the short supply; meanwhile, keep enjoying the other variety. They kind of got that cake feeling, like the SnackWell's cake, but it's also tastes like that Snack Pack thing where you bite into it and you're like, \"What am I even eating? What is this thing?\" It's got that grainy chocolate thing going on. I'm not letting it go; let's see how it goes with milk - see if that changes my mind. No, not liking this aftertaste either. So we'll do the triple dunk: one, two, three. You can just see it splurging milk out there. Now it's not even to the... you know how I like... you watch the show or Oreo Oration; subscribe to us here on YouTube - you know that I like the fact that a traditional chocolate sucks in that milk gets a bit soggy. This is too soggy, not a fan, but it's not bad, it's not a bad cookie.",

That's literally the way the cookie crumbles for the Oreo Cakesters. But what do you think? You probably have tried these before. Leave your review as a video response below. Like the video, then subscribe to my channel now. Here's the big question: ladies and gentlemen, I'm or reviewing cak... I'm going out of my way to review every Oreo. What Oreos am I missing? Leave it in the comments below, along with where you are so I know where to get them. Then please share this video with your friends. I'll be back every Wednesday and Friday until I run out of cookies to review. But until then, keep on dunking. I have to wash my hands.\"",
