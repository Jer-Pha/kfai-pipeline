I don't understand how this keeps happening to the NHL; they're not a super popular sport. No, it's not like, you know, oh man, we're bringing in the fans so here we are, give us more money or what. Hockey is a very lucrative sport, but all right, well tell me about it. Um, it's the smallest of the four major sports and and you know, but like you know infinitely bigger than any of the other sports in you know in the United States that are not in the big four um so the CBA, the collective bargaining agreement which the union had the players union has with the league had expired and there were fights over a few things but the the major sticking points this time around were um are different than they were in 2004 2005 when this happened last time and we lost the entire season um the sticking points back then had a lot to",

Um, the sticking points back then had a lot to do with the salary cap; which we have a salary cap now, we didn't have a salary cap before then, so it was designed to create parity in the league. This time around, the arguments had to do with profit sharing; the players are making like 57% of revenue from the league, which is strange because they don't own the teams; and the league wanted to basically reverse the numbers; and in addition, they wanted to start making rules about entry-level contracts and uh contract lengths and how you can stagger money over contracts. Because what would often happen would be a player would sign like a six-year contract at $30 million but he'd make like $99 million the first year and then he would make like $7 million the next year or it would reverse it, and so it would be cheaper up",

And um, you know, the players had dug in, unlike the last time, uh, The Players had had uh hired uh a representative named Donald Fehr, who is like prolific in athletic labor disputes. You're telling me about this? It was the baseball one that was the other one he was famous for. Yeah, so everyone well maybe not everyone remembers it but not uh I mean it was a huge deal and baseball was like all all **** up in the early mid 90s and um there was a lot of disharmony between uh the league and the players, and so there were this was a lockout. So this was the the the league saying you cannot play. The things that were happening in baseball were actually player strikes, um mostly, and um Donald Fehr came in and got the players the deal they wanted and something that was acceptable to Major League Baseball.",

Yeah, I love the Islanders; I watch every game, and and um, it was just unfortunate in the sense that if you look at it through the lens of the fact that this just happened, yeah, and that we don't want something predictable like this to happen every six or eight years when the CBA is up, um, I think that the solution would have been, and the players offered this in the league declined, that they should have just kept playing under the terms of the old CBA until they made a new one while they",

So it sucked, it sucked. And I think it's bad for the sport to have uh people think that we're not a legit league because we can't get our labor together and stuff like that. And I think we lost a lot of gains that we were making um with American you know Canada loves hockey and Northern United States loves hockey too but we were starting to make strides in the Midwest and in the South a little bit um in certain markets that I think were ruined um and it's just disappointing that the peak",

Um, Mighty Ducks helped, street hockey helped, yeah, yeah, well street hockey made it accessible to markets that don't have rinks and um Southern expansion with the Panthers and the Lightning and the Coyotes and the Dallas Stars and all these things.

And it was a shame but I'm just glad that it's back and it's 48-game season, and we'll see what happens. And and uh it's just good to have the sport because it's it's what I do to occupy my time, in it is what you do, it is what you do.
