I'm Greg Miller, and while you're out living your life surfing in those waves, uh, the fine people at Nabisco were making endless variations to Milk's Favorite Cookie. So every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like the video then subscribe to my YouTube channel today. We're reviewing God help us all Golden Oreo Cakesters. Now I'm sure you know all about Oreo Oration; you saw last week's show on Wednesday, there I reviewed regular Oreo Cakesters and did not enjoy them - they left a very bad taste in my mouth. I gave them a 4/5 on the review scale, of course we go zero to 10, 10 being the best, zero being the worst. I might have overrated them; it's just sticking with me. We'll see if I have to adjust my scoring here at all. Of course, we start with the first look - once again a good first look. I like the packaging; I like the fact you open up and there's just...",

I already can tell you that the texture is better; it's not as soft and gross as last time was. Definitely a market improvement over the original Oreo Cakester. The Golden Oreo Cakester, I guess this is what it is right there - it's golden cake. It tastes like golden cake when you bite into it, with some cream in the middle, that's a real thing. Whereas this little chocolate cake bastard that was the Oreo Cakester before - granted, there's chocolate cake, I'm not saying there's no chocolate cake - but the taste, the snack well-taste, it didn't work. This is actually working. I'll take another bite; I'll show you. I don't hate them. I'll also spit it all over the place because what the hell? Okay, let's see how these guys pair with milk. Of course, milk and Oreo go together like milk and Oreos. I don't know - here we go, we're going to",
