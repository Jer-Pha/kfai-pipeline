Alright, one thing a lot of people don't know about me, I'm not sure even if you know the depth of this, but I was always a huge Star Wars fan when I was young, yeah, I was just as passionate about Star Wars, but then I found girls, well, I found girls one and two, I found the prequels, and the prequels were so offensive to me, yeah, especially as they went along to like where episode 3 was like garbage.",

Now that Disney has acquired Star Wars and they just... they're just going to run this thing into the ground and I don't blame them, they paid like 4 billion dollars for this but they are just going to take this thing and just destroy it even more, don't you think?

You know, I mean what we had here was A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi - an amazing trilogy of movies that told a concise story with an unknown backstory. It started with Episode IV; we didn't know what happened, and that was kind of cool. They would talk about the Clone Wars and Jedi of the past and things that had happened with you know Obi-Wan and and Vader and and all these things - it was kind of left unsaid. The expanded universe was kind of a window into what would have happened if the story had continued with Han Solo's children, for instance Luke Skywalker kind of doing his thing at the Academy and all those kinds of things.

He captures Han Solo right; he works with Darth Vader for you know the money. He flies away and slaves one right. He's like he comes back in Return of the Jedi, he's at Jabba's Palace. He does battle with Han Solo; he's knocked into the Sarlacc pit right. There's an air of mystery around him right.
