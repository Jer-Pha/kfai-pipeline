I supported gay marriage for like 10 years before Barack Obama supported gay marriage. That guy is full of ****. What's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg Miller, and this is my roommate Colin Moriarty. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff, so every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, throw it at him, and we talk it out for your amusement if you like that.

It requires cooperation between both sides because one side, the Democrats want to buy a permanent majority by making all of these immigrants legal now. Let's not mix it up at all, like the Democrats do not care about these people; they don't care about them, okay? They want to win in posterity, future seats, future future future gains voting very similar but much bigger and more important than the Republicans secured with the Cubans when Castro came to power. Right, Cuban Americans until very recently were a hardcore Republican as a legacy of what the Republicans did for them when the Communists took over Cuba right there's a legacy thing there. And that happens over and over again; it's the same reason why uh black people voted Republican for generations is because of Lincoln, it wasn't necessarily because of like what the Republican party",

It wasn't necessarily because of like what the Republican party was doing for them after that. It was because Lincoln freed them, beat the Confederates, and then occupied the South to make sure they could vote and live. Gotcha you know. And like that's something that they didn't forget. Now this happens over and over and over again in American history. And I think the largely Hispanic illegal immigration population is being taken advantage of by the Democrats really in a shameless way by saying that like we'll give you a way in, and we're doing it because it's the human rights thing. It's not they don't care about that. They like don't care. They want to secure cheap labor for business interests that fund their campaigns period. And they want to secure a permanent majority at the federal level in elections period. That was the idea. And I don't want",

That was the idea, and I don't want to disparage only them because Bush tried to do it sure in 2005 and 2006 with the Republicans, in which the Republicans still controlled the House and the Senate until 2006, and that failed. So here's the solution: Here it comes. The Democrats just passed a bill in the Senate that has no prayer of passing the House, so I'm not even worried about it. But, but even if you know about it, I won't ever read about it. Uh, in that bill, uh, which is like 1,100 pages long, like absurd. I don't even know who writes this stuff. Like, why can't this be a few pages? No one knows. Um, it basically gives illegal immigrants legal status and a pathway to citizenship. Okay, now I agree with half of that.

We can't really do anything about it now, so just come out of the shadows, register, get your driver's license, do all those kinds of things. You can never become a citizen of this country or you're free to leave and get back in line in the country from which you came, and come in the legal way, and that's basically it. I don't understand like why we can't meet in the middle ground like this. Oh, it's politics - that's not how this works. You can pay taxes; you can do all those things but you can't vote. You know, you have to pay taxes. Yes, if you mean if you work, you're going to have to pay taxes.

Let's not act like Barack Obama is a great champion of freedom and a great champion of civil rights because he's not.

What they care about is getting votes and permanent majorities in at the federal level, and making the Republican Party a regional party, which is what it will be. You know, because let's not forget that the Republicans didn't have a majority in the House for like 40 something years; they were a regional party. We sent a few people, like Nixon and Reagan, to the White House, but by and large federal politics were dictated by liberals.

And it's okay to say, \"Like, we're not going to do that to you anymore,\" but like, you can never be a citizen of this country like that.
