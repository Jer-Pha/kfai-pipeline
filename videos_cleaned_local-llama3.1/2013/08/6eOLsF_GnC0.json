And if you didn't know, VidCon is basically this YouTube internet video convention where we all learn to be better at making videos. And with that in mind, I had a few things I want to talk about. Number one, new show - it's one of the most requested things I think I get. Uh, we put up a conversation with Colin, of course you should check it out every Tuesday and Thursday here on youtube.com/gameovergreggy. But a lot of times in the comments, the question I get or I guess the suggestion I get is that you guys like to see a conversation with Greg where instead of hosting - cuz you know I'm good at this hosting thing - I should actually be answering questions and you know saying what I think of things and what what what do I think things are all about. Other than Pello, I like Prello, I like you so I'm starting up a show called Ask Greg Anything. I know real creative title on my part I'm",

I'm very tired if you can think of a better one let me know in the comments below we'll figure it out from there but basically what I'm going to do is every Wednesday and Friday see filling in the gaps here up at noon on Monday conversation with Colin Tuesday and Thursday Wednesday and Friday now uh uh uh conversation with me where I will answer your questions here on the YouTube in a little vlog style it'll be fun you and I talking to each other so how do you fit into this Ask Greg Anything? It's it's simple you can leave a comment on the video here you know whatever you can tweet at me give me the thing there. I'd prefer it for the viewers this is going to be a visual show it's going to be a YouTube vloggy show I'd prefer it if you left a video response with your question that I can then put in",

Will be one question unless they're really short, I guess I don't know, we'll see what happens. And you know, we'll answer. I'll talk it out, I'll see what I have to say about this, see if I can help you with your problem. Spoiler alert: I cannot help you with your problem. Topic number two? Yes, well, this isn't topic number two, but Colin's doing dishes right now in the kitchen. Topic number two... that's something I've known for a while and I haven't been able to figure out a great way to get around it. Right, I want to be better to you guys as YouTube subscribers, YouTube fans. You come here, you watch the content, leave all these great comments, but the problem of course is that I publish the videos at 6:\"",

When I wake up, I go to work, and I can't answer comments in time. So you guys just talk amongst yourselves. I feel like I can't get in ever in a timely fashion to give you comments to talk about what you're saying on a conversation with K.H., what you'll soon be saying on Ask Greg Anything. So what I'm doing now is going to set an alarm every day, wake up at 6:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time (8:00 a.m. Central, 9:00 a.m. Eastern, 10 p.m. GMT). I used to think that meant General Mountain Time, but it's really Greenwich Mean Time; it's what all the UK people use for time, anyway. So I'm going to wake up at 6:00 a.m. my time, set a little thing, get my coffee, maybe make some.",

Uh, for the first time ever, you want to know what it's called? It's called \"Horribly Wrong Comic Book Origins.\" Uh, it's an a long requested thing right where I said, hey Colin, hey Colin, there's this here tell me this person's origin story and Colin who knows nothing about comics tells me the origin story. They're usually really wrong, so it's part of Geek Week. And as part of Geek Week we have to launch at a set time, so all seven episodes are going live on Wednesday the 7th at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time again, again uh, 2:00 a.m. Central Time, 3:00 a.m. Eastern Time, 7:00 a.m. GMT. Before we start bitching about the times too, that's what YouTube said to do. I can't, I mean I'm working with them right.

Fact of the matter, Game Over Greggy's very hard to edit; takes a long time to edit. Game Over Greggy's other shows aren't that much time, and you see I do this in my free time. I have a job as you probably know, and hopefully read and watch videos over at IGN.com. But I'll get back to Oreos one day, probably. Me and Nick are kicking around some ideas on how to uh edit the 14 we've already shot - that just sit on my computer and do nothing. So we're working on it. Oreos will be back one day; no timetable. Enjoy our conversation with Colin on Tuesday, Wednesday ask Greg anything, Thursday a conversation with Colin, Friday ask Greg anything.

I don't go to Vic's anymore at work all that often. When I do though, I always get The Big Burrito and say I'm going to cut this in half and throw half of it away. I'm going to cut it in half, put it in the fridge, and I just eat the whole thing. I don't need that. Nobody needs that much burrito. No one needs... yeah, no one needs the amount of calories that I Burr. But we're programmed to eat. Clean your plate, yep, yep. That's why you gotta make smaller portions they say.
