I imagine that's what it's like in the shower. It's not like he's submerged in water, right? InFAMOUS Two around New Marais - that's when there are big problems. He drops into the water, gets electrocuted, kills himself and everybody around him. I think here just a little bit of like a sponge bath; he'd be all right. Also, maybe just doesn't shower. It's like the apocalypse, right? Do they have running water? That's the other problem too. I guess now everywhere he goes is the apocalypse pretty much - it's the end of everything. Remember Zeke misses Pizza. I think that's the least of their problems if they...if they have like a shower. So what else you got? And the second idea is, uh, you talk about Portillo's and your favorite...what are what is your favorite food to eat? What do you like to uh eat the most? What what's your favorite food out there? What's my favorite.",

I I have videos on this channel about how to make my favorite food. You got to get this is when you don't want to go touching your eyeballs, your butthole, you don't want to get sick, you want to get your butt hole sick with some chicken juice. I talk about it on Up at Noon. I'm going to order a chicken wing and I'm ordering a pizza and like a gallon of beer and be the happiest man in the world. It no, I mean like you asking me what my favorite food, it calls everything into question about me, like am I not... I mean you know I like PlayStation right? Am I not serving team fat well? Well enough? I mean like I'm I'm I'm pretty vocal about\"",
