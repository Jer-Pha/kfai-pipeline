Um there was a moment in college actually about a year in college where um I was freelancing for IGN, but I rarely played games that like were not for work, um I was just going in a different direction at that time, I was actually working at the Massachusetts Historical Society and kind of doubling down on academia and stuff like that. And um I remember that that was a specific year when like um Resident Evil 4 came out and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, I think, SRE, and some and a few other games that bought but like those were the only games I played not for work, not for freelancing. But then I got you know way back into it and it's always been there, always had. I know it's impossible to imagine that. See I don't think it is for me.

I would not have the appreciation for the things I have the appreciation for now, because I appreciate comics even if I know nothing about them, you know. Jon Snow, no nothing, yeah, Jon Snow. It's a reference to Game of Thrones fans out there, so yeah, that's that's basically it. It's actually kind of sad to think about life without that game; it is very sad.
