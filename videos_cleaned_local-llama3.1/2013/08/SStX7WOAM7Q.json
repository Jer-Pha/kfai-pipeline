            "text": "Welcome to Horribly Wrong Comic Book Origins, where a non-comic fan takes a crack at a classic comic tale. Today's origin is Superman. Well I'm glad you asked about Superman because of course this is one of the most famous stories in the entire history of comic books. Greg, I'm going to give you a little bit of insight about where Superman came from. I know you're really into him but I don't think you know the entire story. I don't think you, this is like the one that no one's going to be able to, everyone knows the story of Superman. Well in case you're confused let me catch you up. There's a planet around the binary star Sirius about 40 light years away, it's called Krypton. And Krypton is under, for hundreds of years has been a civil war, a global civil war. And it basically all comes to a head when the planet is destroyed by an aerial bombardment. This creates ejecta. Greg, you're familiar with ejecta right? Sure, it's something spiraling off the planet. Why in an aerial",

Why in an aerial civil war would you blow up your own planet? Well because they had somewhere else to live at this point Greg, they had hundreds of years to find a new planet. So the ejecta is sprouted off, this is hundreds of thousands of years ago by the way, in Earth time. And the ejecta shoots away at about 30,000 miles an hour, hurdles through space and it just so happens that on one of these pieces of ejecta is the person who will become Superman but we don't know his name yet, we don't know anything about it. Why don't we know his name? Well because we can't speak that language Greg, we don't really know anything about what happened on this planet. Seems like a boring part, so like the first, the pages of this story are just jibber jabber that doesn't make any sense in the word book. Well we can recon it",

Well we can recon it later Greg but right now what we're focused on is this man hurtling through space and about 10,000 years ago Greg in what would become Missouri, a meteor crashes and our friend Superman is in this meteor. Now you've seen Encino Man so you're familiar with the man in the ice? Paulie Shore, Sean Astin, who hasn't seen Encino Man. Right exactly, so Superman is encased in ice very similar to Encino Man because he's been hurtling through space, a vacuum about 4 degrees Kelvin, very cold Greg. Incredibly cold. Now the meteor strikes Missouri, nothing happens for about 10,000 years. In 1932 during the height of the Great Depression, a potato farmer named Bob Kent. Potatoes in Missouri, that's what, okay. So a potato farmer named Bob Kent is kind of tilling his farm. Now Greg I don't know what",

Now Greg I don't know what you know about agriculture but you kind of have to switch and swap crops every once in a while. So Bob doesn't do this, he continues to grow potatoes and so the soil is becoming not good, he's got to till it, he's got to kind of dig it up and when he's digging the soil up in 1932 he comes across this ice, this man in ice. This is very similar to Encino Man, this might have actually inspired Encino Man. And so he digs this man up, he melts him and it's a boy, he's a teenage boy. And this is of course the story of Superboy but that's really not very interesting because at this point Superboy doesn't really have any powers, we don't really know about his powers yet. So this is Boy, this is the story of Boy. Well his friends really liked him, he was actually really good at baseball so they",

So Superman is dug up out of the ground, he's raised by Bobby Kent, Bobby names him Clark after his grandfather actually who was also a potato farmer but a potato farmer in Ireland. And so he grows up kind of a normal life in Missouri and then goes to Notre Dame, the University of Notre Dame, the Fighting Irish. And he studies journalism. Okay so he's in Missouri, home of the greatest journalism school in the country and he decides to go play some football at Notre Dame and it's at Notre Dame when he kind of starts running into some troubles he meets a dude named Lex Luthor at",

And him and Lex have some problems and it's really there that he starts to kind of figure out his own origin story and his own strength and it's at that point that he becomes Superman. Okay a lot wrong with that. Of course everyone knows the origin story of Superman but I mean nice try. You did your best there. Of course Krypton explodes, sends him in a rocket ship, not encased in ice. You know why Krypton explodes, it changes every time they do the story. Maybe it's Brainiac, maybe they're mining, whatever. Aerial bombardment. No, Vans in Smallville, Kansas gets found by the Kent's not single father potato farmer, Mr. Kent, Jonathan Kent, Martha Kent.
