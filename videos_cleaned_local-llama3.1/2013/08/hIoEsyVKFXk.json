I think it's a kind of a thing that a lot of people reflect on actually at work or people we know, people on the internet like: how do you not get tired of each other? How do you... you know, you're you know even like my best friend at home, Ramone right? You know, Ra'onne. We live together; we live next to each other when we were freshmen and then we lived together when we were sophomores. We wanted to kill each other, you know. I like... I love Ramon.

Other way, I always describe us, I: We once talked about something and like it was the same situation but we had different views on it. I'm like well that's why I'm Superman and you're Batman, and you said something annoying like well that's why you're totally out of date, nobody cares about you, and I'm cool, my God, but I mean more like I you know I I like I'm always really positive right, I'm always trying to see the good in people and the good in the situation, and you're always like everybody everyone's out to get us we got to kill them, yeah, I mean Batman doesn't kill for",
