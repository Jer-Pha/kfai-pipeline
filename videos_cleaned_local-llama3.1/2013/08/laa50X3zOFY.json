Shut up Portillo! Portillo, you **** I'mma kill you. What's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation with Colin. I'm Greg and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin here says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull it out, toss it at him, and we talk about it for your amusement if you like that. Like the video, subscribe to your channel, share with your friends so everyone can see how crazy Colin is. Colin, are you ready? Today's topic of conversation is: Is a college degree really relevant in 2013? This is from Snoogans2You. Yeah, absolutely. Why is that? Now you don't think... we work at a website IGN; we write about video games. Oh, for a long time, talked about how people come to work for IGN and don't have",

Oh, we for a long time talked about how people come to work for IGN and don't have a degree in journalism or writing or English, whatever they may be. Even finish college sometimes. They get to work with us, yeah. Uh, so there's an emotional sense like, like a kind of an emotional plea for college education, but there's also a really practical data-driven reason for this. The unemployment rate of college graduates in the United States is very low, like 4%. The overall, uh, especially during the recession, the overall unemployment rate was like three times higher than that. So, uh, you can just do the math - someone without a college degree, um, just mathematically is less likely to get a job. Um, so does it matter what your degree's in? Clearly not, I don't think so. Like I think my mom always put it really well, my mom's an English major.",

Like, there's obviously very practical applications for all these things, but studying at KU probably isn't as useful as other options. Yeah, that's good, that's good little rival, I never understand uh it's how I feel about BU - so BU is easy to make fun of, that's all you have to do, that's it, dude. Yeah, be you there, you go everybody north that's what you do, make like one of those cardboard signs but then have the hand animated, you just move the hand back and you know somebody does this and makes a YouTube video, you'll see what I mean. So like, I think that like a college degree is not obviously there's plenty of people out there that are successful and do their thing without a college degree it's just like you're at an inherent disadvantage to that one, like always I don't care like how successful or how much money you made or what you do, you're at an inherent disadvantage to a college degree and um",

Yeah, like it's just there's something about a college degree, you know? Obviously if you get higher and higher in grad school and get a PhD, that speaks for itself. But like just having a bachelor's degree might not be as significant as it was in the past. And uh, there are too many people probably going to college today because there aren't enough jobs that require a college degree. So like there's always this argument that maybe we're sending too many people to college and maybe that argument is fine - you need a blue-collar worker or low-skill worker who'll take a job nobody else wants.

That's actually more important, but it's about segueing from one to the other, parlaying them and connecting them together - that I think is really important. And I noticed that like an education is super important; I'm not saying you can't teach yourself or be intelligent without a college degree or high school degree for that matter. I want proof that you know something, and that's proof that you committed to something, trained for something, did something. So, like, that's kind of my take on it. Let's go to... put it this way.
