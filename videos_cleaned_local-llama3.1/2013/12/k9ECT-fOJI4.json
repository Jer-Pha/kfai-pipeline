So public restrooms, like I'm never I'm never happy about it right? You go in there, you got I hope my shoelaces are tied tight so like the laces don't drag on the bottom and you you hope that they have the little toilet seat covers but then you hope they don't have the automatic flushing system cuz sometimes you know you put the toilet seat cover down and you'll move and that will trigger the automatic flusher thing take the C and you're like God I just got a crap, let me go go to the bath and you lay the toilet paper down that's always like the worst right? That's the the poor man's cover seat you don't want or anything and the worst of course is when you have to go so bad and you get to a bathroom and you get in there and it's just like destroyed.",

You don't want or anything, and the worst of course is when you have to go so bad and you get to a bathroom and you get in there and it's just like destroyed. Right, this is what I don't understand about the pooping in public thing: anybody who's going into these stalls to poop - they're all in the same boat. I have to poop so bad or I just have to poop, and I'm not going to make it to another toilet that's like my own thing. So why would anyone destroy the bowl and leave it that way? Like you were just me, you were literally coming around that corner hoping for a clean toilet, found a clean toilet - clean is - and then you made it worse and didn't do anything about it. That's bad. I'm not a fan of that. So yeah, JB, I'm not a huge fan of public bathrooms, but they are a vital part of the poop economy. You can't not have them; you need them there to get the job done sometimes, you know what I mean, and like I'm...",

You can't not have them; you need them there to get the job done sometimes, you know what I mean? And I feel for you, dog. I wish that was like in American Pie, he had to go home every time during high school. I admire that kid's fortitude because, like me, it's go time, and it's not like I don't want to do it; it's not like I'm going to poop my pants immediately. But when I get that urge, it's like I said on the Girl on Guy podcast \u2013 one in the hand is worth two in the bush. I've got to take the shot while I have it. God only knows what's going to happen next time. So, of course, this is a Gregway; they're disgusting YouTube shows that I post every Wednesday and Friday where I answer your questions.
