Yeah, I do. But I really... I really do like Bane. I think Bane. I think Scarecrow is probably actually the best villain on. I like Scarecrow. Uh, but Bane is close second. And I like the unsettling nature of his voice. I think it's from that GE (he's got a cool mask and a cool voice) and that's all you like about him. His plan makes no sense; he's just stupid. He's like, \"I'm going to destroy Gotham anyway,\" but he makes everybody live with no bridges for a while. All the police go underground, Batman comes back... Never mind the fact that he's got his back broken in another country, climbs out of the hole, gets to Gotham, no problem, no problem whatsoever. Gets back to Gotham has time to put in gasoline, his symbol up... Let me ask you quick. Let me ask you a quick question real quick. Right? Yeah, you like a superhero from",

I like the story, I like the plot. What did you like about it? I like that so here's the thing: the problem I have with it is that there's actually a really cool setup for a really even better plot when they're in the stock market. I was like this is actually really cool because they're going to tank the economy, yeah, like that would have been awesome if they just **** up the market you know, like by deleting whatever the files or whatever, yeah, that'd be fine, sure, that'd be interesting.

That the whole sequence with them on the plane when he's talking and he's like no one cared about me until I turn on the mask or whatever the **** he says. I was like yes, that would be very painful for you, shut the **** up, dude. I think Bane was awesome; I still like Scarecrow the best in all those movies. Like I think that's what's cool about Batman and it's cool about the Joker too because I thought Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was great. All three movies were great, mhm, mhm, um, like the best superhero movies by far that I've ever seen. I haven't seen them all; yeah, but I've seen most of them.

Well, he sounds like Mr. Peanut, and he's way clearer than Mr. Peanut even. I never heard Mr. speak; it's because dumb Mr. Peanut would sound so they don't let him talk that way. And why, in the plane scene, everybody's like, \"What's your plan?\" Makes it now you couldn't understand him. They're stupid all and why what was the point of like Batman going to the doctor for us to find out he has no cartilage in his knees, and then he gets a robo knee or whatever? That'll come back; no, never comes back; never matters again. Alfred, Alfred is his only family in existence, and he fakes his own death to Alfred, and then Alfred sees him at the cafe, and he's like, \"Oh, good job.\" I'd be like, \"What the heck if you faked your own death to me, and then I see you at a cafe?\"",

Remember that guy? Yes, man. I don't know... I think the Undisputed King of the trilogy is Scarecrow, and I wish they brought him back in the third one. And yeah, I think you know they're all great. I think all the movies are great; that's my favorite one though. There's the third one... crazy talk! Call to thank you for your time, Caleb. You're so mad, Caleb. Thank you. We need to watch it together and just figure this out. We need to sort... we should watch them all. Okay, that one. Caleb, thank you for your question.
