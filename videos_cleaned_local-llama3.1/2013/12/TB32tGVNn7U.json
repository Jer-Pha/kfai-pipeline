Today we are reviewing Golden Mega Stuf Oreo Cookies - they were an experience. I mean it's a sheath of cream in my mouth right now. Now let's see what's happening before we even get into the first look, I'm a bit terrified at how the shortbread cookie sweetness will mix with the over sweetness of the cream but that's why you have me to do it so you don't",

Let's see how they twist. Obviously, a huge part of any Oreo is making sure they twist fun. Yeah, perfect. I'm not going to eat this one; I'm going to make another Sixpence None the Richer one. They make great ones. Then there you go - a Sixpence None the Richer Oreo with like the stap puff marshmallow filling in there. Not going to eat it because that will where's... it's one of those things everybody worries about me getting diabetes. I can tell you right now, my brain's like, \"Hold up.\" You are very close; we're Gonna call the doctor and I'll come over with the saw to take your leg. Final score for Mega Stuf Golden Oreos - hmm... it's hard, right? I'm passing judgment; this will affect the stock of Golden Oreo Mega Stuf. I take my job very seriously here. I can't say seriously, but I believe I'm gonna go 75. They're good; they're good, but it's one of those",
