All right, that's the first look. Let's get a taste in here. I'm going, I'm going to bite it right down the center so I get some red, some white. Okay, we have things happening in my mouth. Mhm. What does it taste like, ladies and gentlemen? What do you think? A thin mint? We got a thin mint competitor here. Uh, We've of course done the fudge covered Oreos, the mint fudge covered Oreos. We thought they tasted a lot like a thin mint. These guys really tasting like a thin mint. I like this a lot. Still crispy so got the crispy cookie then you got the mint in there. It's I talked about when I took it out right that had an overwhelming mint smell to it. Tastes not overwhelming at all, very subdued mixes very nice with the chocolate and the mint. Big fan, I'm enjoying this so far. Let's see how this pairs with milk. Give it the old Melrose minute.",
