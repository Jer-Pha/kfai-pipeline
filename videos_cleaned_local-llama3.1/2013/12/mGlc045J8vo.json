Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff.

Like the video, subscribe to the channel, share this video with your friends. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is should the death penalty be abolished, submitted by @AMcCarthy83. No, I agree. I think it should be ramped up a bit. I agree. I think it should be like because here's the thing a lot of these people they'll start telling you that it doesn't solve everything this that and the other. I think that if you just started executing people, be like based, and not like I'm not saying like oh man you jaywalked or something stupid, you know what I mean but like",

I'm not going to steal or be an ****, so that's harsh, that's really harsh. I know, so I I I think the death penalty is totally fine. Um, I think that um argument, like I really think the arguments against the death penalty are borderline incoherent and what is it that we shouldn't think to their level? There's something that like the state shouldn't kill people; we shouldn't you know, two wrongs don't make a right, that kind of thing. I say like that's garbage. Um, uh, and my favorite argument is that it costs more to kill them than it does to keep them in prison, and that the reason that is true is because we give them like 17 appeals and keep them alive for four years before we execute them. So yeah, so here's",

So yeah, so here's here's I've thought a great deal about this actually, thanks to @AMcCarthy83. The death penalty right now is only for capital crimes, like if you killed someone. You killed someone, it's a capital crime. Right? You think that it should be wider than that. I think that if you raped a woman, if you hurt or touched a child or hurt a child, that kind of violently heinous crime - raping a woman is really just as bad as murder. Something you might as well have killed that woman. I'm not saying raping anybody, yeah, of course right. But you know, I'm just helping. There are male rape victims, that's true, yeah. Um, and but see then, just I'm trying to poke holes in your theory already, that would come out right there's that.",

These people who are 18 dating a 17-year-old, no, that's I'm just making sure there's some there's some we got some let me let me let me get to where I'm going, let me get to where I'm going all right. I'm going tell you where I'm going stole a car, bam it's over man. So, so the once the death like so you have your trial right and everyone should have the right to appeal, like for sure, sure, sure. And so you run you run you you have your trial and I think the biggest problem is that we often talk about if the death penalty is on the table before the like before we try people and then like often they'll render the verdict later like well they render the verdict and they'll render the sentence, sure, sure. And what I think we should do in",

So, oh my God, he can't even get down 'cause there's bags everywhere. Nick Scarpino staring at the cameras apart; everything's gone to Hell. Kill Nick too. So, I really think that with, you know, the death penalty like we have to make sure that in his people aren't being killed and that happens and it's not right. It's not right, like, and that I agree is a is a knock against the death penalty. I think that you have to take it one step at a time. Did you do it? Yes or no. If you did it, are we sure you did it? Yeah, yeah, yes or no. If we're sure you did it, is the evidence conclusive where everyone knows that there's no possible way you didn't do it? You know, taking the Reasonable Doubt thing to another degree then you you execute the person; you don't give them any time for any more Appeals. Yeah, if someone is killed and there's some",

You know, it's like... what was that cop Peterson? Right, the smug cop Drew Peterson, and like, I think that whole case against him is totally circumstantial, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, and I'm sure he did it, but you can't really prove it if, like, you can prove with ballistics, if you can prove with DNA evidence all these kinds of things, they did it, then you execute them. With rape, that's actually really easy to do most of the time, if the woman or the man has... you know, the DNA under the fingernails, sure.

Like I think that's important because we don't need to, like, have firing squads and **** like that. And you could still die by firing squad in states like Utah, by the way; they got it right. Um, and you can die by hanging in some states too. Um, some states let you choose the form of execution, but I think that's part of living in a federal system, 10th Amendment lets you die by roller coaster, yeah, let states choose what's right and wrong for them. In a lot of states have outlawed the death penalty, and some states have ramped it up, yeah.
