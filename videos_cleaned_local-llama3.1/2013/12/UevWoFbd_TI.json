I'm Greg Miller, and while you were out trying to figure out what the Vine is, a whole bunch of people over at Nabisco are making endless variations to Milk's Favorite Cookie. So every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like this video, subscribe to my channel, and please share Oreo Oration with your friends - it means a lot to me. Today we are reviewing... drum roll please... Gingerbread Oreos, limited edition. There's been a lot of these limited editions; this is how Oreo holds it over your head, like they got the Disney Vault that they open up, let a couple flavors out, and slam it shut on you. Gingerbread Oreos - still available for some people out there. Uh, the gingerbread, of course, not the cookie. They're not making the cookie taste like it... uh, let's start the oration as we always do with the first look: see what we got going here... they don't at First Look at",

They don't at First Look, at first glance, you're not super impressed right? Like, wow, a whole bunch of brown stuff. It smells like that smell, like gingerbread, they're right. Py all right, I like the smell; I do like the good smell in gingerbread clearly. So does my dog. Let's get a good look at one. Got that? See what I mean? There's no not much difference there in how they look from cookie to cream to cookie. I personally don't think they're that visually interesting, but of course, Oreos\u2014it's all about the taste. Let's see what we got here. Hold on; I like where this is going. Okay, no, it's good. Okay, you're you're too excited. Uh, the shortbread and the gingerbread they work really well together. The gingerbread is not super sweet; it's that gingerbread taste. Get that Starbucks mocha; you tell them put some gingerbread in there. It tastes like that.",
