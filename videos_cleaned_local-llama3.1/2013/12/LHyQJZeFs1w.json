I've eaten out with you many times, and you're actually very similar - if the service is good, I'll give you 20 or 25% tip straight up. Like, I like service that's mindful and not all over me, but like, you don't ever want for anything, and they're friendly. Just being friendly goes a long way; I don't care what your name is. You don't have to be like that at all. I don't like that kind of service, but like, do you want him to sit down at the table when you take your order? No, I don't like that. What's up, Chief? No, no, you call me if you call me Chief; I'll burn your restaurant to the ground. So like, I don't, I don't want like that kind of service where it's like they're very all over.",
