Rayna has ruined his life pretty much because she's a well... I don't know. I don't know about that. What do you mean you don't know about it? I don't think she's a... I think she was stuck in an awful situation, and then it kind of came one of those things where you know it gets harder and harder to tell them as it goes on. Yeah, yeah, I agree with that too. I mean, obviously, you're keeping up at home: Rayna married to Teddy, but she got married when she got pregnant with Maddie right after she got pregnant with Maddie. Deacon went to rehab. Deacon was her old boyfriend; she was kind of seeing Teddy at the same time, then they decided to get married when she was pregnant and hide the paternity of Maddie from everyone - only like three people knew. Yeah, now the problem with that, of course, is that then Deacon came out of rehab and he was...",

Now the problem with that, of course, is that then Deacon came out of rehab and he was totally fine; he'd been sober up until this final episode of Nashville, and now his life's in ruins. He's a mess because Matt knew exactly where to go for paperwork, which is weird. Yeah, I don't know why you keep your paperwork in a little silver tin in your closet. Don't open children's paternity involved, yeah. But now okay, so let's get back to the fact that I still think... I mean, like what was Rayna thinking? What did she mean by it when it became clear and like this is you know we're talking about the Nashville prequel here that we'd film one day when it became clear that Deacon was no longer an alcoholic, he was on the recovery track and sticking to it. There should have been a discussion between Teddy; we have to figure this out because eventually",

Frat boy suits - someone's going to have to know they're not the father. Someone's going to have to tell her she's going to want to know who her real dad is. Do that dance on the Mario couch, yeah exactly, exactly. So that's where I'm saying she's at some point you had to figure this out, had a conversation. They probably should have had another strategy. I enjoyed that Teddy was so protective of Maddie and I totally get his stance in the situation. So I guess she's not... I'm kind of just throwing her under the bus here cuz I totally get Teddy's thing of like I've raised this daughter, this but in the same breath always be two dads early on exactly there",

We reach into a bag of random names of characters, pull one out, and then we reach into random actions and pull them out, and just let go, let God in fate and Buddha and all them decide the state of Nashville. So I did this when you were in the shower; I was about to say, do we have these ready? All right, so now you're going to reach in and pull out a person. Shut your eyes, okay? There you go. Reach in and pull out a person. Shuffle it up! Pull out a person. There you go. There you go. All right, who do you got? Juliet. All right, so Juliet is going to murder someone.
