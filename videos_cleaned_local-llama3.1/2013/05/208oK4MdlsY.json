Oh Maddie, one of my favorites I was hoping she'd be pregnant or oh God I then now I'm starting to question what I put in here hopefully nothing bad sorry and the Nashville Gods say Maddie is going to take up pickling this season. She has a new hobby that's cool that's good. And the final Nashville Season 2 prediction from the gods: Who doesn't like pickles, you're a monster if you don't like pickles? Wy who I've already predicted will die nope he can't die cuz Teddy's going to die put the Naal Gods W is",
