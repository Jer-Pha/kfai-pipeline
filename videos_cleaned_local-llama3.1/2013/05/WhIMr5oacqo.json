Tell me how Gunnut came to be. Recap season one a little bit. Well, season one, Scarlet and Gunnar worked at The Bluebird together. I think it's a bluebird, right? You're right on target. And they become songwriting pals, and then they get a deal. Yeah, a publishing deal. No, it was for them to be songwriters like it was kind of like artists at... I thought it was at a publisher.

I think it's I think it'll be like one of those... oh, I don't know, like it won't be a straight no, 'cause that's crushing right? Right, yeah. Be like no, get the hell out of here. It's going to be like slow, slow, it down buddy. Let's take it'll be like on Lois and Clark when Clark proposed to Lois and she said, \"Who's asking, Clark or Superman?\" Office glasses, and then that was the end of the season but then we came back and they strung out the is she gonna say yes or no for a while? It's like that's Superman going to say yes, stupid. Especially if it's Henry Cavill, it was not it was Dean Cain. I know Dean Cain was hot; Dean Cain is hot. He is hot. I just...

That's an wow, you just blew my mind, that there's a Nashville paradox. Is Peggy ever going to meet Brad Paisley's wife, played by Kimberly Williams-Paisley? Like wow, yeah. Is Brad Paisley single in the National Universe? We go back and watch to see if he's wearing a wedding ring. If he is, that would be that'd be really up. You just blew my mind on N. You think that's the reason he did the show is cuz his wife's on it. I think it's one of the reasons probably, yeah. I never even realized they were married, yeah.

Maybe they'll redeem him somehow, but that quick little try at redemption at the end didn't sit well with me; I was like, \"no,\" yeah, yeah, he goes and tells the guy, oh, anyways, being all creepy at the bar right there was weird, and then just walking up to Deacon's - I don't know, yeah, that was super awkward. I can see the writer on that too, like, \"oh man, somebody's got to discover Deacon\" who can do that; Gunnar well, Gunner hasn't been in the episode since he was drinking at the bar, M, like I guess we can send him off, like okay cool there's a few interesting things anyways all right so every time we make our predictions on these shows then we let the gods make their predictions - we have one bag with people's names in it, one bag with verbs in it; this decides a random prediction, a wild card.",
