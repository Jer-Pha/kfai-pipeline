            "text": "What's up everybody, it's me Greg Miller. I've been getting a lot of questions there on the social media about Man of Steel, namely, you're a huge Superman fan, what are you going to do if Man of Steel is a disappointment? And the answer, of course, is deny everything. Let me take you back, ladies and gentlemen, to June 29th, 2006. This is an article from the Columbia Daily Tribune: \"New Superman film returns to rescue our emotions, minds\" by Greg Miller. Don't let the 15 minutes fool you; Superman Returns is a good movie. You can choose not to listen to me and begin to panic, but I suggest you put your faith in director Bryan Singer, who left his budding X-Men franchise to helm Superman. He must have known it would be a lose-lose situation. Goes on like this: I have some good criticism in here, right? Like I point out the fact that the comics told a really good story but then the movie totally ignored it, but still denying a lot, denying a lot. Kevin Spacey's Luthor is",

Kate Bosworth, Kate Bosworth, K.B.W., she's a lovely woman, liked her a lot in that Kevin Spacey flick, uh, the one where he's Bobby Darin, that she was good in that, not good in Superman Returns. Very stiff, very terrible, very terrible. But here's the thing about Superman Returns: I didn't know it was bad. I wrote that review not being a jerk, not being a Superman fan. I had to see the good in this movie that I had waited my entire adult life to get this movie. And so here it comes, Superman, directed by the guy who did X-Men 2, Bryan Singer. He does great superhero movies; this one will be great. I watched all the dev diaries about it, you know, leading up to it. Like he showed the Kansas, with the meteor, the ship. You read the comics, and the comics talk about, you know, Clark's been gone, and this is how Lois feels, and you know this is what Bryan Singer from Watchmen",

First off Zack Snyder's here to show action he's going to have Superman punching people we've already seen him punch his way out he's going to throw his Zs there going to be a lot of flying He knows what Superman Returns did wrong because everybody knows, hey Superman Returns, what did you do? I lifted a ship. Uh, I'm vulnerable to Kryptonite but I lifted Kryptonite City out of the ground threw it into space and uh you know remember Superman the movie repeated the same exact plot that's what I did Superman so Zack Snyder knows this right you're coming in and making this movie, Geoff Johns is looking over he's in charge of the Batman Universe all stuff I have High Hopes the trailers look excellent if they",

I'll let you know, but I don't think I will be. I think time's going to prove me right on this one. What do you think?

Hey, it's Colin; talking about that Batman, why doesn't he kill people? I don't know. Listen to Colin; I mean, I know Colin doesn't know because Colin was busy like playing athletics and stuff when he was a kid. I was out there reading comics doing God's work.",
