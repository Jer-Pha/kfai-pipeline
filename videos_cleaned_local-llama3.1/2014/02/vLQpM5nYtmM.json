It doesn't make any sense right? Like we have a guy here who's an icon for young women and men, and whoever likes his music. I honestly have never even heard of Justin Bieber's song; I have no idea what he does. I had it for a while, but there's the 'Baby' one - somebody said 'baby baby baby baby.' Thank you, yeah, get it back. I don't, I don't know any of that kind of stuff, but he has a fan base right? And he's like, he's breaking the law and like that's totally fine. Uh, you know if you want to deport him because he's a felon right? Like if he's do you know... But if he's making these mistakes, we have to kind of sympathize with him in a way right?
