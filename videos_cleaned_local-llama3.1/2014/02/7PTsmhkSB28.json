These samples are uncut, barrel strength right now. Oh, you know I love uncut so the alcohol by volume on them is very high in fact they are too strong to get a proper taste of them so it is recommended that you hit them with some water. Why I brought that jar of water in the room so that they open up a bit just don't use ice that inhibits the aroma, it will make it tougher to pick out the one you like. Remember we are not looking for smooth we are looking for character so keep your senses tuned for things that everyone loves about bourbon. These are going to be used for mostly fancy old fashions. It has to be good enough to hold its own though without relying on juice and mixers. So we have a few to try here, how many we got? Okay and we want to do this first with uncut five I.

There you go; it was horrible. David Ballard... uh-uh. Okay, so mine is actually... um okay, well mine is definitely the Uncharted 2 rap party... uh-uh.
