I understand that obviously go get help for any of these issues. Yeah, I think you know, I but I but principally like I think you can kill yourself for any reason, you know, and like that's not really anyone's business, you know? But like we shouldn't, you know, obviously encourage that with people who are healthy and have something, you know, have a life and people who love them. And Stu, like sometimes they lose sight of those things and they don't realize that anymore. But then when we jump the fence and we're like into, yeah, physician-assisted suicide, and this has to do with because you have terminal cancer, you have an illness that you can't deal with, um, you know, you're not going to live anyway, and you want to go quietly into the night before it starts to really ravage your body or whatever like that.
