Here's what I think about it: I don't personally care that much about it; I think it's a fine holiday or whatever, manufactured 120%, but I think that I'm bad at managing my time if it's not on the calendar. I'm not good about it. This in 2014, what I'm trying to be better about is managing time and making time for both hobbies that I enjoy, but then also, oh, I should probably have quality time with Christine right where it's not just \"I'm G\" come home and edit YouTube videos all night and come to bed at 1 in the morning. You know what I mean? Like, try to make that not be the case. And so for I'm sure there are thousands of people like me right where Valentine's Day isn't so much \"hey buy something\" as much as \"hey this is a day where you need to take someone to dinner, be like hey thank you so much for being my partner.\"",

She understands that I have hobbies, and that we have this side business, and that like, we you know, do all these things. And you know, that I have a lot on my plate, and we try to spend you know, as much quality time as we can together. Whether that's just watching a television show or a movie or a documentary, or going to dinner, or like doing all those kinds of things. And I just don't like that February... no matter all these things that we do for each other, the time we enjoy each other. There's this expectation on February 14th, and it just doesn't make any sense to me. Like, yeah maybe that's good for bad boyfriends, but I'm not a bad boyfriend, you know? And she's not a bad girlfriend, but like, it's all the emphasis is on me to do these things on this holiday, and I just don't like it, you know? Like, I just wish we would all just protest.",
