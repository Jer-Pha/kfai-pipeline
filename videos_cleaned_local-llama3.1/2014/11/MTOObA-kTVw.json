Yeah, he was in bad shape, like he had surgery 'cause like I don't know what yours was like, but I remember when I broke mine, I was a senior in high school, and it was like the worst pain ever. Not be not from breaking it because I broke it when I was on my BMX, and I and my chain broke, and I fixed my bike and biked to my friend's house where my friend was working me to the hospital. So the injury itself, I knew something was wrong, but it was like a day or two later when you're trying to do literally anything, and you're like, \"I had no idea how much I used this.\" Like I remember the first day my alarm clock went off, and I went to like go get it, and I like screamed out in pain. I was like, \"I can't... you can't move.\" I couldn't get in and out of a car; I couldn't sit down or get up. I like it was just when he when I found out he broke his clavicle, I was like, \"Holy **** did\"",

So I just realized I messed up and I lied, I did not break my clavicle by doing the mile, that's when I broke my collarbone. This is my thumb bone, good story like picturing you falling in such a way that you like I did break it while running, but it wasn't running the mile in high school, it was running at my little brother's Elementary School thing they were doing like this festival and there was an off-school course and I was racing a kindergartener, oh jeez, and there was a part where you had to go down and get underneath the ropes or whatever, army style and I",

Ladies and gentlemen, the concept of the GameOverGreggy show is simple: each week four sometimes five best friends gather around this table, each bringing a random topic of conversation for your amusement. Colin, how did you not do the podcast last week? Yeah, I know, I felt weird; I didn't like it all. I'm my own man. Well, so that's a show that wasn't worth a dollar to you. That one was not worth a dollar. No, it was worth a dollar; you should buy it again if... no. Four best friends at the table, if you like that, there are a number of ways to support us.

Um, but then the unsung hero of the Virgin flights is the GoPro Channel - you can just put that thing on and watch all this crazy **** happening, listen to music, and it's awesome.
