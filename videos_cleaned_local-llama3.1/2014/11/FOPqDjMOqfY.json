That was so also at the end when they kind of go back and redo a lot of the scenes they did before with different characters, like when the girl plays the cop and stuff like that. Yeah, it's weird. I like I actually really like just because of how stupid it is in terms of that mid to late 80s Mallrats aesthetic or whatever - just the stuff when it was still innocent and fine and we didn't really know where they were going with like that.
