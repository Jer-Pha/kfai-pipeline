Now I'm Tim Gettys, I don't know how to do any of that so we got Erick Castro, the master bartender, to teach us a thing or two. Thanks for having me, so Erick, I'm going to drop a scenario on you real quick okay we're all up in the club and I look over and I see Nicki Minaj chilling and I'm like Nikki, I want to get at you but I don't want to show her the Anaconda too quick, you know I want to get her the drink I want, I want her to be happy. What drink do I need to get for Nicki Minaj? Well that raised a lot of philosophical questions about what kind of drink Nicki Minaj would like to have naturally but you know what when I think of Hip Hop I think of gin and juice so I think I got a little something perfect for it, called the Southside.

Well we already have the juice, we have to have the Gin, yep! I'm going to grab some mint, about 10 or 12 mint leaves, fresh picked. Give it a good slap and drop those bad dogs inside. I'm going fill this up with some Ice, Ice Baby, another hip-hop classic. So we're just going to shake that up, we're shaking it out here. We're also able to get Taylor Swift if Nikki is not interested. I'm get my cocktail glass, I'm going to strain all that out using a fine strainer right here. You got all this little pieces of mint and everything out of my drink that's",
