But before we got started, before we got into the whole thrust of the show, we wanted to talk to you guys a little bit about a tragedy that's happened to our whole community here. Uh, a lot of you know Jared Petty. He works with us at IGN. Sadly hasn't been on The Game Over Greggy Show yet, but he's coming. Um, the other day, Saturday night, he had a car accident he was in with his wife. Um, Jared's okay. He's banged up. Obviously, no one comes away from a head-on collision with a driver on drugs all that well. But sadly, his wife is in a whole bunch of trouble. She's in the hospital right now. They're working on her. They're trying to, you know, basically piece it all back together, their life, figure everything out. Um, they've started a GoFundMe page uh so they can be supported that they can help with hospital bills. They can help with the time off of work they need to take",

Now, the thing was, try sand effect. That theater, I've never been in a theater. Like I've been in midnight releases before. I've been in like a bunch of stuff. Nothing compared to that theater. Every single person was just like this Fast and Furious series doesn't give a **** No, they don't care. It was awesome. They do care though. They care about fans so much. Exactly. The theater was full of people that were like, \"Good lord.\" That was a good moment. That was cool. That's one of my moments. Not that obviously, but being with being being I still haven't seen that movie. I started it drunk, then I fell asleep, and then I still got back to it. I'm like, whatever.",

Um, my my similar moment I've talked about I think here is Avengers. Avengers being such a **** ride that entire movie. So much fun. Every it was a midnight release. Everybody there was a comic book fan. and we're all along. We're cheering. We're doing all the dumb stuff. But like when Thanos pops up, again, spoilers as the post-credits scene or you know, not even the postredits, but the first postredit scene, right? And like when he turns and looks over his shoulder and does that grin, I'll never forget the girl in front of me standing up and going, \"Oh my god.\" Like like she had just won a car on Oprah. Did you do the Kermit? Yeah, but",

But like wrapping my head around it, like if Man of Steel ended in Dark Knight Rises, I don't think I would have been like, like literally freaking the **** out. But everyone in that theater flipped the **** out and it was awesome. It was a great time. And I left and I was with Damon. I was like, that was like the most fun I've had at the movies ever, probably ever. The other the other moment, a great moment, and we talked about it again, too.

And uh when um Raphael meets Casey Jones for the first time in the park, that's a really awesome little scene, like an interchange between them. And I love Casey Jones so much. Just that specific Casey Jones is my like my favorite. I just love the idea of that character.

Just a really awesome movie. That movie really holds up too. I watch that movie like once a year and I'm like I **** love this movie. This is so good. That's why just looking at that I didn't even watch and I will not watch that new movie. Looking at that movie I was like get the **** out of here with that **** The opening scene The opening scene of the second one is also very very memorable. Oh yeah.

Here comes a Die Hard. No. So no. Well, I do love Die Hard. There's nothing every every moment Die Hard is tear-jerorthy. Every single one of them. But no, there's one that that that gets me every time I watch it cuz it's at the it's at the end of a very very like long but powerful movie which is Blade Runner. There's the scene where he's sitting up there and he's talking basically Roy Batty's character just saved his life. Have you guys seen Blade Runner at all? Nope.
