We're going to start this drink out with a couple - two Angostura bitters. Which bitters are kind of like the salt and pepper cocktail, so just a little bit goes a long way. I'm going to do a quarter ounce of simple syrup and it would be a bourbon old-fashioned that a couple ounces of good old Kentucky Bourbon now Erick, I see the trend a lot of people tweet pictures at us because they know it's like our official drink on Kinda Funny and they're putting muddled fruit in it and they're messing it up. What's with that? Why are people doing that? Unfortunately, that's something that kind of started up in the early 1900s and it's been pretty hard to get rid of ever since. Simple is what the old bartenders control about so we're putting a little bit of icy air in the in the mix it around with that one actor another nice no we're actually not going to",

And of course, if you want to learn more about craft cocktails - the ones you can order from a bar, make at home - keep it tuned to Kinda Funny calm. And Eric, you have a little deal for everyone out there: if you'd like to have me come up with a custom cocktail made specifically for you, go to Patreon.com/KindaFunny (not Scishow). Visit his bars, Polite Provisions in San Diego or Boilermaker in New York City. Until next time, I'm going to go bathe in bourbon.",
