You go next. Thank you. Well, my question and my topics uh always come from Twitter, remember if you want a topic on the Game Over Greggy show please tweet at me @Nick_Scarpino and sometimes I will read your topic like at Madame Matisse. Did I say that? What is it, Matisse or... Matamoros? Ask this question: why do Americans hate Florida? As a Canadian, I've always wondered, do we hate Florida? I love this topic. I don't, I don't personally hate Florida. Some people disparage it; some people disparage the South a lot, but is that a thing though? America's hitting Florida no, but we we we maybe like laugh at it because it just seems like a lot of crazy stuff goes down in Florida. It's like the way a lot of crazy stuff goes down in Russia, like you just see all these crazy videos yeah I don't know it's it's just kind of like that same sort of thing just",

Like San Francisco is a cool town, but it's got so many issues that it just brought upon itself - that's the thing that's really frustrating me and continues to bring upon itself. Yeah, it's just the city's kind of just like a mess.

I'm libertarian, which is what I am, and it's a very live and let live city, like unless you're really effing with someone, they're not going to do anything to you.
