My thought on this is that luckily I watched as a kid a show called \"The Williams Show\" and I believe he had someone of a similar variety on in that her story of like for you to bring it up or like and be like suffer, like I immediately am right there, I can totally understand. I forget, I forget what was happening physiologically to make this happen biologically to make this happen but yeah like what a horrible thing. I mean I think about it like just I mean again this goes back to a topic we did in the GameOverGreggy Show, I'm sure Kevin's annotating to it right now where I was saying I wish I understood from a literal perspective what the female orgasms felt like from a female's perspective, but I mean if you try to even remotely flip the script, right? If it were just how awkward is it when you get an erection.",

Like I can only imagine. Yeah, true story about Montel Williams, thank you, please, Montel, love. He served with my mom's long-term boyfriend; I just call my stepdad, uh, and him served in the Navy together, really. Yeah, I would not have pegged Montel Williams as a Navy man. Oh, they do keep in touch? I don't think so, no. But I mean, they were serving together at some point. What's up, Montel? How awesome would it be if someone, like Montel, called you and was like, \"Hey, what was the name of that bar we were at in Japan?\" You know, like the S, thanks, man, thanks.",

I was going to say it would be a lot worse; you'd literally be dehydrated for like you'd have to be just constantly swallowing water. So another question I had for you guys was obviously, you guys, if this could happen to you, would you do it? It's like, obviously the answer is no, no. But what if it was for a limited time, like for one day? Would you do this for one day? No, yes, I would do... I get anything or is it just that you'd know what it feels like for two hours of orgasms? I would do it for one day; no, I'm fine. I know what an orgasm feels like - what two hours of it is? I know we're doing guy orgasms right; guy orgasms are better when there's like... you build them up.

On top of that, it's just the worst thing on the planet. Don't look at me like that, Greg. It was a funny joke; I was waiting for a comment. It was slightly funny; it was good.
