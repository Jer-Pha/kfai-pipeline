He's being as good as he can; he's my nine-year-old Wiener Dog. He knows now, of course, that when this box shows up and it says Bark Box or at least it smells like treats, it's his time of the month. Because every month BarkBox sends you and your furry friend a whole bunch of goodies. You subscribe; it's great. If you want 10% off your BarkBox subscription, all you have to do is go to barkbox.com/gameovergreggy. However, let's get Portillo in right now because he's dying. All right, you ready everybody?
