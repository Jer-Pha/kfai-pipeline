Okay, you've taken your money or your parents' money; I'll accept that. What do you got for me? I'm gonna leave this one off okay because I don't know if you guys can beat this. It's simultaneously the worst and best and most awesome purchase that I've ever made: a thousand live ladybugs from Amazon.com. The reasoning was, because I could; I saw it on Amazon, and I was like, \"No way.\" What did you do with all of them? How much did they cost? It was like $4.99 for 499 bugs, don't cost money for a thousand live ladybugs. And they came in this little box, and me and Alfredo were like, \"This is awesome; they're alive!\" Then we were like, \"And then you punch the... that was it.\" We were so excited. I didn't believe we were going to get them, and we really got them. Thank you. What did you do? Let him go? Yeah, we ended up just leaving him in this park near my house. Well, did this is what I would have done; I would have",

Shrubs in cool places to hang out to hang out. The hell else do a ladybug want not to be eaten by a Praying Mantis? What eats ladybugs? Snakes, everything. Frogs are kind of the bane of the insect world, yeah. They got what do they even do? Ladybugs, yeah. I mean, like, what is their purpose? Like bees pollinating crap. I don't know. We should Amazon it though because there's obviously a purchase or like a reason for them to be purchasable. They must be food, you like, you feed crickets to stuff, you probably feed ladybugs to stuff. I really hope you don't feed them; they're well, sure, crickets are hideous, little bastards.

Yeah, imagine if your back opened up and wings came out. Yeah, that's what a ladybug is - it's got a hard shell that opens up, and it's trippy. I like that character, Terry, stupid; I mean, it was a ladybug, but it was a dude. I'm not a huge fan of bugs. Yeah, no, they freak me out. Little bedbugs, I don't like them in my house. Mhm. If I see a bug outside the house, I'll leave it alone - that's its habitat. I had a thing with bugs in elementary school where I liked them a lot because... so Power Rangers; everyone knows I love that show. There was another show, Beetleborgs, which was similar to that, and because I was a little kid, I liked it because it was another thing to watch, and so I got kind of obsessed with Beetalings and stuff.",

And then proposed spontaneously caught her off guard did the whole thing. And then like the wood ring was sized for finger, put it on but then they went and picked a real ring afterwards right?

It's like all right cool, and then I'd go there with $100 and I'd come back with nothing, right? And I had like Blue Stinger on Dreamcast. I think about that all the time. All the dumb movies you go see just because there's nothing else to do when really why didn't you just tell yourself to save that money away and play the games you have or have friends come over to watch your VHS's, or whatever dude. That's a great idea. I used to go to the movies all the time, which was so funny 'cause I don't go to the movies at all anymore. I used to go to the movies; I probably went to the movies literally 50 times a year, yeah. And oh yeah, of course, but I would say I saw like everything during that period, like '98 to 2003 was though, that's all there was to do. It was like cable television wasn't prevalent and games you couldn't afford.",

I do not watch TV shows; I'm like, I don't know it's like wow, it's funny how much it's changed.
