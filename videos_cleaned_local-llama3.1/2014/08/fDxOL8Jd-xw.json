Oh my God, you know what I mean? This is like now dating your best friend's daughter on top of your son's ex-girlfriend, maybe brother's ex-girlfriend - there's so incestuous in this world. Yeah, this is crazy. I like that. What comic book is this? This is Batman Beyond 2.0, that was chapter 27, that had happened 28, it's like the 26-27-28 arc where they're on right now. Cuz I guess I had missed this - been catching up on IGN.com comics articles about all this. Right in the fact that in the Batman Beyond animated series which I enjoyed but I had already...

So whatever I what that's where we're getting hung up on the thing. Fair enough, fair enough, this is crazy. So comics in general seem to have taken this CRA \u2013 I mean not that they weren't always crazy right? But now I feel like they can just be even more crazy. This whole digital thing and like it's it's easier to make comics and distribute comics. Like people are way more focused on these, let's just have a crazy ass story. See, it's not even...

You get your year, you get your story and you want to draw back and do like I mean this is a terrible example but in terms of movies right you want to make Superman Returns and draw back to the Donner films more power to you, you know what I mean. Like that's why I always bring up the one in you know I did the episode of GameOverGreggy where I was like what Comics should you read? I always call out Last Son of the you know the Jeff Johns Richard Donner Last Son Series right which is like Zod comes to Earth there's this kid that Lois and Clark try to adopt or whatever and it's like it's almost a sequel to the Richard Donner movies because it exists in this like odd space you know what I mean of like it could be Zod space",

It's like, yes, that's awesome; just do that because we have this same problem with the movies right? Like, all right, we're rebooting Spider-Man so you have to see his origin again. Hey, hey, guys, Spider-Man needs our help; swing all the cranes over here \u2013 that was on the other day, it was great. Let me uh ask you a quick question: L It on Me Chief?

I kind of want to be really fast too, and it would be cool to be able to see through things. Also, I'd like to hear really far away, 'cause then it's like... you know? Be that's a stupid one. I wouldn't want that. It's awesome you can hear bullets coming from miles away, like \"hit me and just die, I don't care.\" So yeah, I mean it's it's awesome, but yeah, Colin's right; it's hard to write a good Superman story 100%. That's it, it's hard to write a good Superman movie. Yeah, I think he's just too much. Yeah, no conflict, anyway. Back to Batman... **** the **** out of Batgirl and giving her a baby was crazy. God, I and it's one of those things that I don't... it's just never really occurred to me, you know what I mean? Like somebody pointed out in the interview I was reading on IGN, right?

Sure sure sure and there's going to be a certain amount of attraction that would happen to a man of his stature in both communities, both the crime-fighting and business community so yeah I mean I could definitely see it happen.

Right? Four things there you go. Let's take a step back though before we wrap this one up: isn't that the whole thing when you were a kid and you imagine yourself maybe being the only person who did this, you imagine yourself as a superhero, wasn't part of that, that you got to get the girl?
