TV Guide is reporting that Warner Bros. TV is considering a revival of the old ABC Family sitcom Full House, which ran from 1987 to 1995. Those are good years, yeah, yeah. This would be a continuation of the family story that would include some of the original cast actor John Stamos. This is interesting - actor John Stamos, who played Uncle Jesse, is one of the people championing for the return of the show, and as TV Guide points out, Stamos has an ownership stake in the show. How the hell does that happen? I have no idea, but that's probably why he's freaking loaded. So he has good taste, you don't know this, no never, I've never heard that in my life.
