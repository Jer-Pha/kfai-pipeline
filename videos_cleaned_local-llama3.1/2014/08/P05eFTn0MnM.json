So it's like because of the shittiness there had to be someone who was like \"oh no, we need to do something with this.\" It brought Transformers to the public eye in a way it hasn't been since '96 with Beast Wars and before that the 80s. Yeah, you know? It's just like saying the ends justify the means - yeah okay, it's a necessary evil. So that's what I'm saying: I want to ruin the movies even more.

Yeah, there's like 35 overseas markets where people like Target to actually make money. The biggest of which is China, obviously. And now everyone's super scared because China is now starting to make their own films and they have for years, but now they're flirting with making their own blockbuster films. And if that's the case then basically our entire market will just collapse in the states.

When you look at it, so much of the films take place internationally, and that's why, like, Transformers 4 half of it was in China, it's because they're marketing to China because they know that's where they're going to make the money. Fast and Furious is always in like 10 million different places because they're like trying to appeal to a global audience. They also get money from China - if you have a good movie in their country that makes their country look awesome, the Chinese government will pay for it. We want that China money.

There's too many movies; people only have a certain amount of time and money to spend on these things, and there's no new ideas. It's just totally vapid. Like I look at some of these movies, and I'm like, \"What the ****?\" Where are the good ideas? Like, the last really...I want to say the last one, but like, one of the last movies I can really think of that was like a really bold new idea that felt fresh, it was interesting, and was exciting was Inception. When you think about a movie like that, that was like, \"That's **** dope,\" you know? Did did you see the trailer for Interstellar, his next movie? Oh yeah, that one looks rad too, and like I like these...you know, like we talked about it, I think with Inception. Like I didn't realize",
