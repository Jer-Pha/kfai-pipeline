I'm doing well, thanks for having me. Yeah, you having fun? Eh. We'll see how the night goes, alright. Over there, the pure one, Tim Gettys. That's him, a host. This is the good one. I was telling him last week that this was going to be the good one. This is going to be the good one. Are you excited for what's happening? Very, very excited. Okay, over here is the empty chair for Colin Moriarty. He's coming as fast as he can. He's in an Uber cab right now. He is in an Uber cab trying to get here. He doesn't know, no, no. This is Christine everybody. Hi. Her name is Christine Lakin. Hi, I'm Christine Lakin. You are currently famous. It sounded like an AA star. I have something to confess, it's been rough.

Now here's the question for Nick and Tim. I gave you none of that information coming in zero. Has it dawned on you who she is yet? We've gone through two voice acting roles. She's been in a number of films. Thank you, sure. That doesn't help you actually. No, it doesn't help you at all. But it's fun to watch you figure it out. Right. It's fun to see confusion in your eyes. See this is hard. My eyes are in my hand right now. For everyone, the enjoyment will have to be like watching their face light up.

I was blown away that Christy was coming to IGN today. No idea who it was. Then Christy's coming to my house. No, Nick knows. Nick and I are old. Tim's 24. Sorry. You have to remember though, I tried to forget most of my childhood because I lived in a place as an obese child when I was younger. So anything not like before 22, I choose not to remember. Now you can try to cover it up. If you remember two weeks ago in the game of Greg Miller, we talked about the hit sitcom Step By Step.

But I do think it's quite funny that people, when I've seen things like this before, people are like, oh yeah, do you remember the girls on that show? Yeah. And then the one got hot. The one you didn't expect to get hot got hot. And I'm always like, thank you? You can understand. I have a look. They type passed you in. You were the tomboy. You had the backwards hats. You came from the Patrick Duffy side of the relationship. That was the boy household. Yeah, it was the boy household. That's why I don't think anybody was expecting great things from you.

So I have a million questions about Step Up. Okay, go for it. How did this begin for you? You knew from an early age obviously you were going to be an actor. I was that kid that was doing plays on the mantle of the fireplace when I was two, three years old. I'm familiar with that. Yeah. I don't know Step Up, but I'm familiar with the mantle. I'm familiar with the fireplace. I was doing productions of Annie. I think my parents always knew that was going to be the case for me. Or the curse for me. We moved to Atlanta and I was doing theater and then I sort of fell into doing random local commercials. How young were you when you started the show? Yeah, it",

That's the hard thing because you're a fully grown beautiful woman now. Thank you. Yes. Yes. I was two. You were two? I was two years old. Oh, you were two years old. I'll drink to that. I am the worst person, guys. So you're in Atlanta. I'm in Atlanta. That's where you're from. We moved there when I was six. Okay. Just because of the acting. No. And randomly, that's kind of where the theater started to happen. Gotcha. So I was doing local commercials and stuff. I was down doing theater in random South Georgia and an agent from LA was there with her family. She came up to my mom and was like, you know, I think your daughter is really talented.

We're not really. That's not really the goal. We're happy in Atlanta, Georgia. The home of Coca-Cola. Yeah. We're good with that. So about a year later, my mom took me out for like a mother-daughter trip. And she was kind of like, this might be fun. We'll do some auditions, you know, whatever, write the trip off. And I did some, I put together like a tape and you know, had an agent I met and they were like, all right, if anything's right, we'll send you out for it. And like two months later, we got this call. They were looking for this kid. They couldn't find this role. And they'd seen my tape and they wanted us to like fly ourselves out. My dad's like, my dad, I come home and I'm like 11 years old.",

And I remember being like, that? No, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Flying across the, no, no, I got things. I got to dissect a frog. I'm taking care of a friend's dog. I got a life. Like, it was very funny, but he was like, you know, very supportive of me. And we came out and did this audition and I got the job and it like went for a long time. So in the beginning, one of those very weird stories. Of course you understand, obviously you've, do you live in LA now? Yeah. I don't understand how much of a ridiculous story that is that you just told me. Oh, absolutely. And there's probably a lot of actors that watch our show, maybe one or two at least, that are",

Rosenbaum's like, I had to wait until I got Smallville. You know, but it's like, it's different for every actor and it, and that happens a lot throughout your career. You know what I'm saying? There are like waves of that kind of stuff where you're just like, yeah, I just auditioned for this role and it turned out to be like one of the greatest things that ever happened to me. You're like, you know, I always wanted to play this and then I finally got to, or, you know. Yeah. But it's not like, like Neil Patrick Harris, you've seen that happen for him like 15 times. Yeah.

We were in that together and if you haven't seen it, check it out on Amazon, would you? That's what launched both of your careers. The Proposal. The Proposal for him, me, I think it put me down. I went down. It was actually a step down for you? Yeah, step down. That's insane though because it's very seldom that you get a show and not only do you get a show, but you get a show that goes seven years. Yeah, especially like nowadays, I mean, nothing goes seven years. No. Lost. Lost. Only what, five years? Yeah, maybe not even that. Six months. Why am I looking at you?

Why do you think it's going to last? Oh my God, I'm there for a week and a half to do the pilot. And then when you do the pilot and you wait three months, they pick up a handful of the shows. I mean, it's like slim pickings. I remember Stacy Keach's mom was standing outside and she looks at my mom and she's like, don't get too attached. Most of these things don't get picked up. And she walked inside and my mom was like, oh God. What have we done? Back to Atlanta. But I was like, of course we had no expectation of that.

Yeah, did they move out there with you? Mom moved out with me. We had an apartment there. I went to a high school in Atlanta. I went back once a month. You had to be the coolest kid. God, you were so cool. You would think. Imagine being in seventh grade at the height of TGIF. That's when most kids are really getting in the groove of watching it. But you're younger than me, obviously. But don't say it. How young are you? I'm 31. So you were in what grade when you were watching it? Fourth grade? I don't know. Third grade?

Let's back up for a second and let's talk about the TGIF lineup. Can you bring us through what was on? Do you guys remember what it was? Full House, Family Matters, Step By Step, Perfect Strangers, and then at one point it was Boy Meets World. There was a Going Wild. That's like the dream team of television. That's why everyone's lives revolved around it. Will they see you next week when they say goodbye to you on TGIF? And then there would be the things in between where a family would be hosting the TGIF. It's like, hi, welcome back. We're just watching everyone's shows.

When I Google Image Search, there was a picture of you and Topanga just chilling out. Holy shit. Really? Okay, so now this makes sense to me. How's Topanga? Tim just got in the game right now. All right, listen, listen. So yeah, when we were like, we met, I was like 15 and I think she was like 13.

The problem with Step by Step was that it was, if I remember correctly, it was later in the lineup. And so I don't think I ever really made it too much. It was nine o'clock.

The 9:30 slot was the week slot because that was when all the shows that came and went and were cancelled. But wasn't that Perfect Strangers? She was saying that was like Perfect Strangers. In the beginning, so the classic lineup included Full House at 8 and then Family Matters at 8:30.

And God, that's the worst. Especially when you just have it all built up in your mind right. Because part of you knows, part of you can sense when a person's not 100 percent committed to you. You know what's coming. And so it's just sort of like there's all sorts of mixed emotions going on right. But I'll agree with you because I've tried all those strategies. I've tried hooking up immediately, looking up someone. Tried getting drunk, which is never a good idea. That's never an answer to anything. I've even tried trying to date someone who I deemed or my friends deemed was hotter, which there's just it doesn't really work. It's too superficial. It's not what it's about. It just fades away and you're still pining after the other person, and then it's not fair to the person.",

And then you think about it and you don't hurt anymore. It doesn't hurt anymore. And not only that but you can take what sort of your perspective was on that relationship and apply it like what you learned from that apply it to your next one. Hopefully that's a little bit better.

Yeah, but I'm just saying, like, there are all these movies and stuff where it's like, \"Oh man, my girl broke up with me; I'm at the bar by myself.\" Right, right, I'm going to get a bottle of whiskey.

You don't know why it's here and you either start texting or the worst you call her or the worst that you call her and she actually picks up which happened to me where I literally was super drunk one time after this girl broke up with me and I had told her I was like I'm going to be a man.

And for me, like I feel like breakups are just the closest you get to being depressed ever, like it's the worst you ever feel because it's just like man I'm not good enough. It's always I'm not good enough for whatever it is. Then you start feeling not good enough for yourself and you start thinking about it all.

That's never going to be that easy, but it does kind of help just to be like this is going to be okay. Eventually this is going to be okay.

They're dying and they're choking. And the Starbucks employee charged the firefighters one hundred and thirty dollars for cases of water instead of just giving them the fucking water.

One hundred twenty dollars. Give it to me. I don't know if I can.\" Yeah, I mean...like, don't get me wrong; I would've given the water. Yeah, it's just one of those things.

And so what you said that was very funny is like they had the same accent as Australians. I knew this. Never tell them that. Don't tell someone from New Zealand they have the same accent. They'll get pissed off. Just stick on top of it for a second because we're all going to get back to the same point here real quick that it never dawned on me the fact that I thought that that was there that like the fact that why would these people have Australian like accents.

So he commits those things to memory; it's a passion subject, you're going to learn more about, you can retain more of it.

I'm dumb. You're dumb American which I've always said I'm a meathead American from the middle of the country. I think there's something to be said and this is what I was talking about earlier. I want Colin Moriarty's opinion on this. The fact that the United States is so vast. There's so much going on. There's 50 states right here.

The thing that the thing that fascinates me though is that you know I guess you mean northeast Europe so you mean like Scandinavia that's where you thought New Zealand was right so like not northeast of France which we were talking about before but like going all the way around towards like Russia or towards the Baltic states and shit like that and then going up.

But what I always feel like is it always we always assimilate these people and we take little things from their culture and make them our own. And I read this really interesting piece by this gentleman, Henry Liu, a Chinese American, who was saying that America is unique because a Chinese family will come here and they rear Chinese American people that are one foot in the Chinese culture and one foot in the American culture; but what makes the United States interesting and unique whether it's Mexican American or",

It only goes really the other way, meaning that we have the unique position of like assimilating these cultures and bringing them here and kind of melting them together, and that is what America is. So I don't really feel like there's a danger in having like an immigration policy that lets new people in here because I feel like we actually have thrived on that, whether it was the Chinese coming to build the railroad, what was the Irish escaping the potato famine, whether it was the Russians trying to get out of you know after the Soviets took over in the 19 teens after World War one, whether it was the Jews coming here after World War two or but right before World War two when they knew",
