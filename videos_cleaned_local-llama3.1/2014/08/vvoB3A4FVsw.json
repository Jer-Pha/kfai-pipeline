How do you feel when people yell at you about or yeah just in general about the thumbnails on the YouTube shows? I'm just like, guys come on. Just so you know, I'm the guy that makes the thumbnails on these videos. My favorite was when the Emma Watson one was used on the Super Fight thing and there was a threat about like why did you keep using these over-sexualized images and it was just her, like she was a girl. Like, I mean we talked about Hermione; I mean the conscious decision didn't use a sexy picture of her. Many exist. I was like, no, we're just talking about her as a person to person Super Fight video. Go check it out with tight clothes on; she wasn't well that's just oh yeah the game says that yeah we talk about worse things than the than the thumbnail so what are the unsexiest things about sex this comes up I can't wait to see where the origin is it's not even",

It's like, \"So what do you want to do now?\" Uh-uh. Then you just panic. He was like, \"I don't know, you're doing it wrong.\" You have to immediately pass out.
