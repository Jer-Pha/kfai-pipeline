If you if you have a topic for the show, please feel free to follow me on Twitter at Nick Scarpino, tweet me your topics like \"The Furious Iceberg.\" That's pretty good, I guess. It's pretty good in 10 years should Disney reboot Star Wars episodes 1 through three? It'll have been 25 years and doing a good take on Vader's fall is needed, which I think I agree with. First of all, the fact that it's been 25 years since '99 at that point is just scary; isn't that trippy? Fifteen years right now, which is insane. I remember going to see \"The Abomination\" live with my dad. Used to say me some people are gonna die. I love that you love it. I went to see it with my brother and my dad. They took me out of school; I was in ninth grade when I came out, or 10th grade, and uh, I remember seeing it and I'm like, \"Oh, that was pretty good.\" You know? I like walked out of there, yeah. I was like, \"All right, I can do that.\"",

And Ben's a good guy, he's come a long way. Just grab him, give the biggest wedgie in this parking lot. The poor kid just wanted to see Star Wars in peace and here we were swearing in front of them talking about how we didn't much care for Star Wars. And then he had to give him the wedgie. I just don't know, it was a whole thing. Sadly that wasn't the worst thing that happened to that kid that night. No, I guess not.

They're all over the damn place, and they can't jump over him. I mean, the problem was like I actually said before on the show: I feel like the movies actually got worse a lot of people feel like that. I actually feel like Episode One, strictly because of Darth Maul, was actually really superior to the other two. At least everyone will agree with that. A lot of people think that's the worst one. I thought three was good; I enjoy it now. I want to say I've always been indifferent to Star Wars. I've never been in love with it. So it's like, whatever. These are fun movies, but I...

So I think by the time we get through the movies that are already announced it's not it's there's going to be no reason to restart it to reboot it. I think they will though, they'll have something they'll need to do something at that point though won't they? I mean you know maybe that'll just be like ah we we released the original trilogy again and we unfucked them. I don't know, I'd like to see it happen, I'd like to see him give it to yeah 10 years from now they're like JJ you want to take another crack at it cuz JJ will deal with it and probably go away for a while.
