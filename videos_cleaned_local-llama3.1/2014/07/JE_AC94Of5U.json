You can't just put ice in a glass; you've got to chip it away at it with your cool vests and your bow tie and your suspenders - it's a show you more than most people I think would be a man who understands fine ice. I do enjoy my ice. You need the finesse when you're paying $10, $12, $14 for a cocktail; they put all the love and respect into that cocktail. If I could pay $8 for that cocktail and just get ice cubes, you'd be right - that'd be all right with that. Okay, now here's the thing: I was thinking about it.

And Netflix is in that weird place where it doesn't have a large value to most people. Yeah, I cancelled mine. Did you? Yeah, really. I was in LA, I was in a hotel room and I had a desperate need to watch The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. It was not on Netflix. I said \"**** you, Netflix.\" Really right there. First of all, let me commend you on your choices in life because The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is wildly believed to have brought the series back because it's the third one. Yeah, the second one was abysmal. Thank you. We can all agree that's the worst Fast and Furious movie. I have a framed The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift poster at home. Oh, it's so good.

What is then is are you saying like four or five or something? Think four is the worst, it's the one where they go through the drug tunnels right, but it's drug driving fast cars through drug tunnels. Drug tunnels, Tim Gettys, you suck! Tim, you suck! Tim, drug tunnels, you don't suck! Tim, here's the thing about wrestling: poast Christine watches a little bit of it was interested enough; we had Chris Jericho on up at noon, we started watching the documentaries and then we tumbled down a hole because when you're going through the documentaries for me I'm like, oh yeah, like DX, oh yeah, the Attitude Era, you know, the click and Madison Square Garden and all this is great; and then she's like, \"this is just\"",

I mean, I quit for years and then kind of fell back in and fell out and fell back in. And I well, so I mean the real answer is at this point we are now doing a monthly wrestling podcast. Nope, uh, so thanks a lot, Dan. Now I've got a business reason, yeah, to get to write off the WWE Network exactly.

Greg, I like politics; this is a very, very political thing, like loving and hating and evil and good. But I think back to you know the Founders in the Constitution when they wrote it, and when they were kind of all partying together after they won the revolution - 13 Articles of Confederation, then the Constitution. They didn't anticipate political parties and in fact tried to warn against them; and immediately they fractured and had political parties within like one year after the Constitution, like Federalists and Anti-Federalists, and the broadsheets back then were like horrific, like much worse than the newspapers and news we make fun of today, but like the newspapers back then were insane, like what they were saying about people and stuff like that.
