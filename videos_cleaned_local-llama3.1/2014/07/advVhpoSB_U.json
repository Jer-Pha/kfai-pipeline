Oh, okay, I like it when you bring out the laptop; that means it's going to be serious, means some serious stuff that I'm not going to understand while he's doing that. Can I wear Portillo's um b-b tie? I guess if you can fit on your fat neck, fatty. It fits around my neck. No, it does not. It does well here we go now we're all got to see it. This is my topic; I've brought out the laptop to see. Let's go, your first. Oh, that is bigger than I thought it was. I guess nope. Does not fit around my neck. Let me see. Sadly, nope. You got a pencil neck. Moriarty, you wearing a dog collar? You look excellent in the bow tie; you really do. You look great. Let's see if it fits on Tim. Complete the transition; it should fit on Tim. You all got those no fat necks. No, not even close. Really? Yeah, Colin, why is your neck so small? Did you not get fed enough as a kid? You think I got fed too much as a kid. All right, uh, so the show is so ridiculous; I can't breathe this um pass out.",

If you're in California, especially, but in the United States and maybe around the world, you've heard that um we in 2016 in California are going to vote to split California into six states. This is a real thing. This does not sound like a real thing. So let me read you a piece from Time Magazine first to kind of bring you up to speed okay. Remember Time Magazine is the thing that interviewed me about the history of video games, so not a reputable source uh. Proposal to split California in six states moves forward by Katie Steins in San Francisco. Supporters of a long shot measure that would split California in six states plan to submit 1.3 million signatures to election officials on July 15. If every signature if every if every signature were valid, this would mean one in",

This would mean that one in about every 30 Californians is ready to vote on the issue in two years. The borders would be established along county lines outlined in the proposal, creating the states of Jefferson, North California, Silicon Valley, Central California, West California, and South California. The deadline for qualifying for the 2014 election passed in late June, roughly four months after the California Secretary of State gave initial approval to the proposal. The person behind it is a guy named Henry Longbottom, Tim Draper, who's a venture capitalist, known for successful investments in companies such as Hotmail and Skype.",

He's one for one; he says, \"The strongest argument for six California is that we are not well represented. The people down south are very concerned with things like immigration law... blah blah blah.\" So he's basically saying that like the Six States, California is a huge state, and there are different people in different parts of the state who are basically in different states anyway, which makes sense, absolutely true. Um, so anyway, they missed the 2014 midterm election vote, uh, and so they're going to go forward with it in 2016. Um, so I can tell you guys more about it, but first, I'm curious about what you think about it just on face value, and then I'll give you some...

Hey Tim, all right so here's so here's the thing all right here here's I'm gonna I'm just going to fill you in a little bit on on some of the the legalities of this right so Greg is right if the state if we decide all right so there's two things one thing you said is that they're trying to get propose more so they can get less actually that's not possible it this would only be the the the language of the proposal is is literal and you see that sometimes with um various proposals at State levels where they actually have to redraft them and stuff because like one word is off or like one thing is off and like you can't so it can't pass with six states and they're like well take three it's like no you pass it with Six\"",

So Virginia seceded from the Union with the Confederates during the Civil War, and then and then West Virginia was formed by people that didn't want to leave the union, that was like the the kind of the rightful owners of the state as a war rightful you know government of the state even though the Confederates didn't acknowledge them. So that was split. The other times during the Missouri Compromise, a lot of people don't know that Maine was part of Massachusetts until 1820 and the reason that they split the states into two was the Missouri Compromise was basically a way to admit slave states at the same pace that you would admit free states into the union and there was a lot of concern that there would be more slave states or free states so to make the states",

So there's all this weird unintended consequence. Yeah, uh, a report identified a potential increase in tuition for current Californians to attend a University of California campus, particularly residents in California's most northern state, Jefferson, who would not have a single UC campus in the state. Based on the report's findings, six Californias will result in over 60% of California students being classified as out-of-state, raising tuition by $2.5 billion a year. Another criticism of six Californias is that it could increase the lobbying industry sixfold in California to deal with the flood of open questions.

Here's another one: California's current water and water rights issue, which is something Cheryl brought up when we were reading dinner will also have to be resolved among the new states. The California Hetch Hetchy, Los Angeles Aqueduct, and other major aqueducts will cross the new state lines. This will result in new states of Silicon Valley and West California having to rely heavily on imported water. I have a city that does that though, that's not that bad, um, just putting it out there. So, now, the one thing we were bringing up before, and I'll let you guys jump back in, is about the repercussions at the federal level because this creates five new states technically six new states but five new states so 55 states total, and this would mean 10 Senators; the House always stays the same, 435, but this",

Opponents say that this and this was the exact opposite of what I thought; opponents say that this initiative is a thinly disguised Republican power play aimed at diminishing their electoral votes that have historically gone to Democrats in California. In a survey of the California Congressional Delegation, The Hill found that the Democrats oppose the proposition while the Republicans are divided.

See that excites me because I don't like Sacramento so that means we're getting somewhere. San Francisco would be the capital, be San Francisco, I'm not sure it would be Valle, I think San Jose would be the capital why San Jose, S Valley they always do that hey you this state and what's the coolest city is that your capital of course not some **** **** oh this is what it was in the 1800s but our city hall looks really cool yeah know I can see that being San Francisco main base yeah yeah I think it's a legitimate chance San Francisco would be it, but San Jose is the heart of San Valley not San Francisco yeah let's go down it would be probably San Diego would be the capital of Southern California.",
