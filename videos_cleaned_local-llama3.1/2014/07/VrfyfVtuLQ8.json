What is the thumbnail on this one going to be? Before we start talking no, like beards that like hide if you're sexual orientation. Oh, I'm talking about Tim, not that deep. He means I don't know what you just said, what the hell are you talking about? Beards, that's a common name for... if you don't want to come out of the closet, your beard really is like a cover-up. I never heard that, really. No, you live in a way that makes a lot of prior conversations way more contextual. I'm a beard and you're like, \"You don't have a beard,\" what are you talking about? No, yeah, generally if you're a gay man and you have a wife, she is your beard, covering makes you manlier, yeah it makes you... it makes people think you're straight, you're in the closet, you're hiding something. Interesting, I've never heard that, I think you made that up, that's okay, Google \"beard.\"",

That's you with a Col (Colin) to see you with a 5 o'clock shadow. You're always like cleanly shaven; no one gets the shadow he grows in a long time, and he always does that thing where I have to tell him it's like, \"It's time! It's time!\" CU (I can't). So my dad has facial hair, but I grow facial hair; I just don't have it in me. Which is unusual. My dad doesn't usually have a beard or facial hair, but he gets a five o'clock shadow like 10 in the morning. So like, I always assumed that I was going to get that too, but I never did. Um, but yeah, I'll grow my facial hair. See, I... one of the reasons I like shaving my head now as an adult is because I've always shaved my head, but on like two or three shaving cycles of my face from having the perfect fusion of hair and be (beard) and there's like a point about two to two and a half weeks after I shaved my...",

What would you do if he said yes and then just stared? I would turn into the Seal on Reddit and that would be the end of it, but uh, then I started trying to grow it out while I worked at IGN and just it looked terrible, but I was committed to two weeks.
