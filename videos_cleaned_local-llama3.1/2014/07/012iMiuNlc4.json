People might remember that there was a coach, it was Mike Nolan, I think his name was, of the Niners. He wanted to wear a suit like an old-school suit and a hat, and Reebok had to make the suit because they have a deal where the coaches have to wear their paraphernalia. Yeah, so like the reason that people in American NFL coaches don't dress in suits like they used to anymore is it's because they're not allowed; they have to wear their team colors and like the things that are branded with those names or whatever.

I learned about X, and it's like having a conversation with Colin where I click and read the Wikipedia page about something else. You know, does Wikipedia count? Like yeah, literally, as Tim just said, you've got to go to Clickhole more. I just follow him on Twitter, that's how I go now. Yeah, exactly, that's like if it had... If I had to choose a website, I think I'm going to Chive. You guys do one IID probably go to Superficial. To me, superficial is still that, like the Chive, like I said. Their quality, like the things that they curate, they'll lead me to the right stuff. The Superficial for me is because I you know I love Pop Culture. I'm still a huge fan, I'm from Southern California so I still have that in my blood of like I need to know all the gossip that's happening in LA and New York and anywhere else with those bikini-clad women. Um, so I love The Superficial. And again, just to back it up if you've never been to it but",
