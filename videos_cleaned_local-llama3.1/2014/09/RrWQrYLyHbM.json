But what I'm saying is it's changed the big reveal of all this happens on Monday. We're incredibly excited; we're all working on this right now. Uh, we're going live with this Hunter Pence video, this rap video. If you haven't seen a very fun rap video, yeah, rap SP a lot of time making a lot of fun making it right and uh I'm excited for actually the most excited that's probably my favorite shoot I've ever done but really yeah that's good I think so good and we did it for you if you're watching ladies and gentlemen this is my topic too by the way so this is.",

So I want to make sure there is a lot going on, but at the end of the day, all of this is for the best friends out there, right? Well, we're not done, so like help them in different ways exactly. So the whole point of this is: if you've seen our 100th episode video on Monday, it's going live also on Monday instead of the show going live, a video is going live for our Patreon page, Patreon.com/kindafunny. And this is the great news: if you want any of these links, you can just go to kindoffunny.com right? Nick absolutely, and they'll all be there.

I mean, famous baseball player, every there's sorry if this all sounds convoluted and jumbled but it's one of those things where we all had a different task to do here in this thing and we've all run off to the four corners of the earth to do it and now we're finally getting to come back together and talk about it, and so we're all catching up as we go to make sure this works.

I thought this would be cool to talk to him; there it'd be fun to make this Oreo video, I'd learn how to edit video, and we'd all have... I'd have, I'd have fun. It was only I was out there looking for myself; it's all about you. It was yeah, **** you, and uh, that happened. But then along the way these chuckleheads all started getting more and more involved. Originally, if you remember Colin, I had to sell you on conversation with Colin. You were like, \"It's not going to be funny; it's not going to work. Why would I want to do this?\" And I'll never forget we did three conversations with Colin; we did like 18 that day, but in we finished the third and as we were resetting you lean back.",
