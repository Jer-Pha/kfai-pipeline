You can get away from it. There's we're accountable for everything. So it's subscribing - you're subscribing to something. Whereas Kickstarter and stuff like that, like both are crowdfunding but they're very different types of crowd funding.

So I'd like to do some more. So wait, you mean the one where you uh hysterically laughed at your own joke for 45 minutes? Yeah, yeah, that's the one where I literally edited and I kept in a lot of the laughing, and then I cut a big portion of it out, cut a smaller portion out, and I put it at the end of the video.
