While that happens, does someone's farts or burps smell like trash, or is it the trash in the kitchen? Every so often, I got a waft to trash in here earlier. Go to our Patreon page so we can take out the trash. I think it's the trash. Okay, it might be the trash. It might be one of us. Uh, so my topic today, of course, comes from the community. Remember if you uh have a topic for this show uh please tweet it at me Nick Scarpino and it might be one of our topics just like Dancing Joe Man, man, Dancing Joe Man who last week won a very, very landslide vote for the two topics we had. Uh, remember we usually put up two topics for Nick then you vote via likes through through the YouTubes right? Since the schedule's a bit off this week because of the Kinda Funny relaunch, we won't do that this week. Instead, you can pick topics and we'll vote at the table.

So uh a lot of my college stories are very similar in the sense of how messed up I ended up getting but that particular story I think is the essence of the first time I got screwed up and the party wasn't even much of a rager as much as I raged too hard at the party so you were that guy yeah oh yeah probably I remember like the next Monday everyone's like Colin was",

So that was just a that was just that story always sticks out to me just 'cause I remember my mom, my friend, I was so embarrassed 'cause my friend's mom was like, \"Who I've known like most of my life, you know since I was a kid, like a little kid,\" was like me. What the hell are you doing face down in the grass in the backyard? Imagine you like destroying your friend's dad's bottle of peach schnapps and then just being like, \"Why isn't 311 playing right now?\" Just stop. We're going to get we're going to get struck out.
