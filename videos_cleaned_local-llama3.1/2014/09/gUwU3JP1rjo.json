So my questions to you guys are what do you think of the video and what do you think is required for a perfect internet video? Okay, seeing as how we make perfect internet videos every time - that's debatable; we know some yeah no we don't uh. I liked it a lot, my I thought it went on the head Kevin like this, yeah. What Kevin just gave us the year to what that we make perfect internet videos, that's what Kevin does, everybody knows that, love you Kevin, we love you Kevin also by the way, all remember last week on we I was like oh go to Patreon, you can get the you can have tell Kevin insults to shout out at me they",

Yeah, no he is, that guy, he's the only one of the... oh that's the other thing I was asking you, I was like does this guy have other videos? Okay so here's here's a little more background on this now the reason that for me I don't think it is a perfect video is it is way too long, 5 minutes for uh YouTube videos is insane. But the difference here though is this is actual music there just happens to be a funny video to go along with it and I think that's a big uh differential between a lot of YouTube videos where it's like if you're making a comedy song you should make that like a comedy video, you should make it",
