Good, how are you? Good, you tired? Uh, no, I'm actually not bad. It's been a long week for you. It's been a long week for me. Yeah? We'll get to that in a second. Over here, the Pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. First down, the Jets. They're here. That's it. When are they gonna...how... They're 1-0, Greg, 1-0. How famous do you have to get? Now you've dated this video. Maybe they're 1-1 now. Maybe they're...there's something for sure. They definitely are 1-0. They have a record. They've won a game though. They've won a game. How famous do you have to get, you think, so that when you go to the Meadowlands, there's a Colin Moriarty statue out front. You bronze, doing the first down. Me and Joe Namath out front? Yeah. I wanna get you there so badly. How do we also make that happen? We're doing that right here on",

Like, alive? Like, one of the top 1,000? No, 10,000. Okay, that would make sure you still said 10. Wait, before we continue with the intro, can I ask, are the Jets a hugely popular team in the grand scheme of things? Like, right now, are they, like, are they gonna win the Super Bowl? Are they favored for any of this stuff? No. Okay, yeah. So you're easily top 9,000. 9,000. People actually sent me a map real quick. So they released this map, and",

So they released this map, and it was going around the internet. And it was, like, it was county by county who the favorite teams were in every county. And the Jets were the favorite team in none of the counties, including Long Island, two counties. And I was actually talking to people online, and I'm like, I grew up there. There are definitely more Jets fans than Giants fans on Long Island. I don't believe the statistics. I really feel like it's based on TV viewership, which would make more sense, I guess. But that was a little confusing to me. I'm like, I don't think so. Those two counties would definitely be Jets fans. I mean, it's just because they haven't been to a Super Bowl in a really long time. Since 1969. Yeah, so that's probably why they're not in vogue. And then for the Islanders, I think I'm in the top",

Classic. And that happened. But then along the way, these chuckleheads all started getting more and more involved. Originally, if you remember Colin, I had to sell you on conversation with Colin Moriarty. You were like, it's not gonna be funny. It's not gonna work. Why would I want to do this? And I'll never forget, we did three conversations with Colin Moriarty. We did like 18 that day, but we finished the third, and it was, we were resetting.

I still do that, yeah. And he's like, \"The ant is an ingenious animal.\" That was the first episode. That was the first one we recorded. Was that the very first one? You didn't edit that, but yeah. I thought I edited that one, didn't I? No, you didn't edit for long. I took him to learn how to edit and do everything, so I started going down that road. And then we all started getting more and more into the YouTube channel, and more and more serious about what we did. Of course, Tim was the one who has been on this YouTube bandwagon forever. He was making videos before I think any of us knew YouTube was gonna be a thing. We're all like, \"I'll tell you what the future is,\" written articles. Seven page",

I mean, I came back, the whole reason I started the channel was because of VidCon, right? Three VidCons ago, when I went to VidCon, and I was like, I came back and I was like, whoa. So it's been two years then. Is that right? Yeah. But it's- Because we just passed VidCon. So we're into the third year. Yeah. We're just, yeah. Yes. Okay, that makes more sense. That was our third VidCon that we just went to. Correct. That would have been our second anniversary there. So now we're into, whatever. Thanks, Tim Gettys. You're welcome. It's a peer one. Thanks.

Yeah, you've had a lot of pizza here.

And then there's milestones we're putting on the side that range about bringing back a conversation with Colin Moriarty, doing more or videos, giving Nick Scarpino his own show. And I really hope we hit that milestone. Nick's show is my favorite show idea we've ever had. It's going to be amazing.

You're going to want something even cooler because we can deliver something cooler. Right. Right.

Then you vote via likes through the YouTubes. Since the schedule's a bit off this week because of the Kinda Funny relaunch, we won't do that this week. Instead, you can pick topics and we'll vote at the table. Yes. But who won last week? Dancing Joe Man, follow him on Twitter, said,\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n- \"waft\" was already correct, but I added an apostrophe to make it possessive (\"my topic today\")\n- Capitalized \"Patreon\", \"YouTube\", and \"Twitter\"\n- Corrected \"kind of funny relaunch\" to \"Kinda Funny relaunch\" based on the metadata\n- Left all other text intact as per instructions.",

Let's just do that next week. What we look for in a pizza. Because I feel like that there's a lot of opposing opinions on that one. Colin, what's the craziest party you've ever been to? I've thought about this and I don't think, this reminds me of Ashley Tisdale when she was here and we were talking about whatever the hell we were talking about. I said my stories are too incriminating. So this is going to be a hard one to not. So I don't want to incriminate anyone else. I'll incriminate myself though.

I was like 19 or 20 and I went to a little get together at my friend's house on Long Island. I was home for the summer from Northeastern. We ended up getting just super wrecked and we were having a great time. We hadn't seen each other all year. Everyone's coming home from college. I think this was like after freshman year. So we were just having a good time at my buddy's house, swimming in the pool and drinking some beers and hanging out, listening to music. At 19? At 19 years old. Oh my God, you're a law breaker. You must have just been smooth. So, short story, we're all in the backyard at my friend's house and I end up passing out in the backyard and everyone just kind of disperses, goes to bed, sleeps on the couch, whatever. I'm just kind of in the grass in the backyard. The next morning, my friend's mom comes and kind of shakes",

I was all groggy and had never really been that drunk before and just got up and slept on their couch or whatever and woke up at like seven that night and went home. So a lot of my college stories are very similar in the sense of how messed up I ended up getting. But that particular story, I think, is the essence of the first time I got screwed up and the party wasn't even much of a rager as much as I raged too hard at the party. So you were that guy? Oh yeah, probably. Everyone's like, the next Monday everyone's like, Colin was really drunk. Like, I didn't know he could, I didn't know what's going on with him. He went harder than anyone's ever gone. Yeah, so that was just, that story always sticks out to me just because I remember my mom. I",

Now they kind of stink, but at the time period I was there, enough people came. They didn't need us. But every other sport would beg the Tigers to come, because God, they were loud and they actually got in the head of these kids.

Well, they're basically in lingerie to begin with, but they had them doing initiation stuff before we got there. And we got there just in time for them to be like, oh, hey.

That was the invite. You guys were invited. It was a Facebook invite. Oh, wait, is this when you wore the shiny clothes? Yes. I do remember this. We didn't go on purpose. It was a good time. We were too busy. But anyways, like IGN's parties, man, like they're either the lamest things in the world or the best. The most ballers. I think they're usually the most baller.

If it's kind of a public invite fans and then industry people, those tend to blow out, go crazy. Sometimes they're just more subdued. I like a subdued party. Client to client party things. Those are actually really fun, but they're more business. It's different. It's business. It's like, I feel like our holiday parties, there is a fair amount of them that are just spectacular. Like every year I get to throw the company holiday party and they're just awesome. Some of them aren't as awesome. Some of them are. They used to be crazy back then. Yeah, like this thing is like back in the day, they were crazy. The first year I was crazy. Should I share for B-roll the photos of you?",

It was my first year at IGN and it was at this, I think it was the year Hillary Clinton was doing the gold star thing. Oh, the gold star. The stickers. It was a return to form. So this was the year after I started. Was it? Yes, I know because... How long have you been at IGN? Four years. Wow. So when I was there at the party, all I knew was talking about it.

I'm not going to share any names. Okay. But a friend of mine, a coworker that I had worked with, not on the editorial side, I think she was like Ad Ops or something like that, was very drunk. And she came out and was like, didn't know what to do. I was like, I'll get you a cab. Just don't fall into the street and die. So I hailed a cab, got... He pulled over and he was quite adamant about not taking her. He was like, no, she's way too drunk. She's going to throw up in my car. I'm like, you have to take her.

And I'm not going to say his name. He's no longer at the company, but he was demolished. I didn't want to touch him. This is the one sitting on the curb vomiting. There's photos of that.

Yeah, there's a small group of dedicated fans that have been along with me from the beginning just been along for the ride and then just been like supporting these guys as much as we humanly can. And they gave back by doing this one thing - they all have day jobs so they can't like tour and all that stuff. They do every once in a while. But they would have one concert, the Q5 Mega Show.

In 2011, we flew out and they did a history of Q&A concert where they started it. It was like a seven hour endeavor. And they did like all of their hits from 2002 in chronological order building up. And then they went into the future and showed off the things that are going to come. And there's like tone deaf is like his last album was in 2005.

So for people that don't know Faith No More, Faith No More was founded in the mid 80s. And they originally had a different singer. And then in the late 80s, they got another singer. They made their seminal album with Epic on it and From Out of Nowhere and all that kind of stuff. Then they made another album. They have three really great albums from 89 to 95.

Their guitarist I didn't realize was like really young when they started in high school. But I so I got tickets to this show. They played three shows in San Francisco. It was like the first time they had played in a long time together. I guess they were playing some festivals overseas, but they never really played domestically.

Stone Temple Pilots are way better than Soundgarden. Does anyone take Soundgarden in that argument? Soundgarden had like a good album. Stone Temple Pilots had two great albums and a few other good albums. They were always the guys that I confused with Pearl Jam. I think just Pearl Jam.

And just real quick, I just want to tell the story before I forget the one. So I saw the two biggest trips I ever took to see music was Rammstein.

I went to 311 in New Orleans at 311 Day down there. 311 Day they do on March 11th every other year. It's when they play like 75 or 80 songs in an arena. And so like most of their catalog, including like rarities and B-sides. I didn't know they had that many songs. They've been together since 1989. So they have like a ton of songs. They have 13 albums. Plus, like all their B-sides in their collections and stuff like that. And we went down there. We ended up meeting making some great friends that we are still good friends with down there that stayed with us in a hotel. We met them at the show, which is a good time.

Some of them, you know, we would just see them at the shows over the summer. There was a time when I saw 311 six times back to back, like in six or I think it was a week. Like every subsequent show. That's like they mean a lot to me and they'll always be a band that's really special to me. But on the other side of that, one of my favorite records of all time is Green Day's Dookie, Dookie and Nimrod's also one of my favorite Green Day albums.

My parents would let me go see them during Dookie, the Dookie tour or during the Insomniac tour or during the Nimrod tour.

I was just so disappointed and dejected leaving that concert. And the cool thing about it was that some of that bad taste was washed out of my mouth when several years later I met them. I did I did an interview with them for half an hour on camera. It's like on YouTube, probably on IGN. That's generally what happens in the content we make at IGN.
