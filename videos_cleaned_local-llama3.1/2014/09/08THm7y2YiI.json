Uh, so you know Greg and I were driving in a car like this great thank thank you last week and well I don't drive so I don't really know how a car is driven actually uh but we were driving to Sony and we were seeing some PlayStation 4 games before you know some of them were revealed or announced whatever when we were embargoed and we were just talking about the games we're talking about all these things and and what came up was uh The Breakfast Club, which is one of my favorite movies of all time, and we were talking about reboots and how ruin everything right reboots and remakes, remakes, and all this kind of like they and they reboot random stuff like Total Recall, why are you rebooting Total Recall? What the heck are you doing?

No, no. We were you and I were just hypothesizing that I think you're like they can never remake it, I'm like they're going to remake it guaranteed at some point they're going to remake The Breakfast Club. Like what, what, what are they going to be on their phones in the library? Lunch club, they take away their phones, that'll be the big thing. So I was curious about like you know whether it's a you know even a book or a movie or a TV show or or a video game or whatever, like what are the sacred kind of IPs?
