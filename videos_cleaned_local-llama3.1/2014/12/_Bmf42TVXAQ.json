Yeah, well that was pretty classic takes it to the second level. Did Christine have to help you put that on? No, I did it myself. Cheetos did right? I had to tell her not to blow me up and ask why there was a candy bra box in the bathroom. Your nipples peeking out a little bit there. The thing is if you look at Kev, if you know how to F zoom in, you can see my chest hair is all wrapped up in this candy. Luckily Kev doesn't know how. Don't you know?

Some people say this the statement is false because it's actually true and vice versa, but a couple people have agreed that it is what's called a Liar Paradox, meaning that is a paradox because every if you keep going down that rabbit hole it's either true or false, true or false, there's no answer for it. Okay, and it's meant to show that our logic is fundamentally flawed, so the only way that we could have got that right is if we didn't circle either of them with a test correct by not answering by not playing, if he ascribed to that just like WarGames, if Professor Falken marked anyone off for what they answer, that he can go **** himself.

It's harder competition, but at the same time I feel like it's it's really difficult to compete as a creator or as a filmmaker this day and age with a studio that's only making $200 million films.
