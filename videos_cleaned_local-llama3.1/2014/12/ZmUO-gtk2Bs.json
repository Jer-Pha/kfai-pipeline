Damn, that was a low point for The GameOverGreggy Show. And it's not even a real show. It is a real show; we're recording it. Well, sure. This is for Emma only, Emma's eyes only. As I say, only should I... Should I sing her the theme from \"Your Eyes Only\"? Sure. Make it about her though. Hold on, hold on. Let me let us. Emma, thank you for your support. Thank you; continue to support us on Patreon. Thank you a million times. You're amazing. We appreciate it. Nick, now sing us out for Emma's \"Eyes Only\". Emma likes to tweet; she likes to go on those Instagrams. I can't rhyme though. Emma, Emma... I don't even know. I have a fantastic voice waiting for a muse. Emma is where have you been all my life? I just now got creative. Whoa, whoa! Whoa man, thanks Emma.",
