Some gin and then we're going to hit with some uh fresh produce like cucumbers, lime juice, and some tasty ginger beer. First, we're going to do 3/4 oz lime juice, fresh of course. I don't care what the bottle says if it says \"fresh squeezed\" on it and it's on the shelf at a store, it ain't fresh squeezed. What's this? A half oz of simple syrup? Gotcha! Real easy to make - just one part sugar to one part water. Make it at home, you can buy it on your own too, right? Easy. We're going to hit with an ounce of Pimm's and a good ounce of some London Dry Gin. Now, now this is a lot of alcohol so far, and you're telling me this isn't going to taste like alcohol? You know this stuff's a little lower in proof okay than a lot of stuff you buy out there, especially than this gin. So you'll see it's a very comfortable drink; it's a good way to pace yourself all right. Now here's time for the secret ingredient - hit it with a few",

It gets through now we're just going to top this mixture off with a good quality ginger beer that makes me thirsty. Remember, cocktail is nothing without a garnish; hit that with a little lime wheel to press the lady and spank a good mint sprig at the top. Beat that thing's ass, yeah, give it a good slap. You go folks, Pimm's Cup all right, Greg, give it a sip, man, tell me for my approval. Do I drink out the straw to the side? What what what you mean straws AKA sticks well I don't know I'm learning oh wow I wasn't expecting that yeah I expect to be really sweet but there's this hint of cucumber at the end you can taste the the lime and the orange in there that are making it not super sweet but giving that citrus taste there. There's reason they've been drinking those for over 100 years in England here's my question",
