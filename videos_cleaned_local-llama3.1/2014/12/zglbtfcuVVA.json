Wow, yeah, I mean that's a lot, a huge loss of revenue. You've got all the leaked emails, you've got all the private correspondence that were happening - that really embarrassed the hell out of Sony. And frankly, seeing some of the emails and at all this... it was racist. This one's is so you know I think we all sometimes between friends you say things that maybe you wouldn't want the public to know, that maybe isn't that bad, you're joking around, you joke around with each other. I don't think it's really it's not good, it makes them look bad and I don't think there is a people yeah as these emails made them look like...

And so I don't know where everyone comes down on that right because there would be multiple times one I'll pull Colin aside like I cannot stand Greg's ego, it's too much, he's a prima donna, he screams constantly as good as blow his vocal cords out one day, I mean he's gonna be useless to us.

And well I'm not worried about California okay they're never gonna get anything here but they can easily sneak a bomb over the border and so you think a call came from the head of Sony in Japan to the head of Sony America and look, you're gonna pull that movie.
