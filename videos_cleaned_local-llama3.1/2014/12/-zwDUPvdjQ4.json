Thank you for all your support on Patreon, Marco, you're amazing, thank you very much. But Marco is a special case because he went above and beyond what was needed of him; he said, \"I understand I only think this much money to get the thank-you video,\" but I want to give you $200 for one month to make sure he got his conversation with Colin, that's the topic we all signed, we mailed it to him. Well, thank you for that as well. We hope you enjoy what you're looking at here; this is Marco, you got Marco Baron there, he's got his dog, he's chilling with his dog. But then up there, look at that - it's him for president. Looks like a presidential year, is it going to be a presidential election in 2024? Is that a presidential year? So that's cool; Chris is going to run for election you",

You're always talking about how government should be smaller, yes, right? So how many people do you have to employ to vote to get to count all the hanging chads if you had a lot of people? I'm just saying typically an autocratic government is bigger than a republic, super small; everyone will typically so. Here are the next things about Marco that we need to point out: okay, number two, I guess since we pointed it out already here, here's he was at PlayStation Experience, here's his PlayStation 4, we signed... we signed that there, we are right, right up there beyond that's us; then you got Shu got Adam boy somewhere in there, uh, he's DoughboyRifa on Twitter, which might not mean much to you three but to me he's a big Twitch supporter, oh great subscriber on my Twitch channel, he's on all the time doing all things.\"",

Cartoon was the business all right that's enough all right.\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n* \"oldfashioned\" to \"an old-fashioned\"\n* Added apostrophe to \"they'd\"\n* Capitalized \"YouTube\" and added \"com/\" to the URL\n* Corrected \"Follow the Leader it is not definitely not but you God I would have been what the well\" to a more coherent sentence, assuming it was a fragment of a quote or a phrase that was being referenced. The original text seemed to be referencing a YouTube video title.\n* Capitalized \"Nick Scarpino\"\n* Corrected minor spelling and grammar errors throughout the chunk.",
