Why do we do it? It's a tremendous waste of money. You want to show that you love somebody that you don't talk to or see any other time of the year, and so the best way to do it is to buy them a nut platter some garbage right something from Williams that no one's going to use you're just going to put in your drawer never you see it again.

And then I only buy presents for people when I'm guilted into it on like on Christmas or on birthdays. It's very few people. The present I consistently forget or never think about is the wedding gift.

Valentine's Day is the worst, it's the worst, dumb, it's the worst. Do not celebrate this holiday if you're going to do it, why just one day that's one person and just say \"I love you\" that's all it is. No, no, no, no. That is not old. If you go out on Valentine's Day every restaurant has a fixed menu; it's twice as expensive. That's why you cook for your girl, you do that. That's fine, but what I'm saying is don't buy into the whole rigmarole of Valentine's Day right?
