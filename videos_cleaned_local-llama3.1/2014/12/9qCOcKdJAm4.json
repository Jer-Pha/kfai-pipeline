But yeah Short Circuit come on, and especially being a kid when Short Circuit and Short Circuit 2 because I like Short Circuit 2 as a kid because there's none of this **** of having you know Johnny 5's like having an existential crisis right no he's just he's not trying to kill anybody he's just hanging out in New York. He was a weapon, no that's what I'm saying why I like Short Circuit 2 better. I don't have to deal with that baggage of like him being in...

Made something up here. It was just so that they can claim another person on their taxes. It's like Greg claiming 19 people getting no reward for it. Though make up this social security number and see if it works. Uh, Kevin wants me to give a quick shout.",
