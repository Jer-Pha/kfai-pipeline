So, I mean, are we talking with the people that I legitimately will me will tell people that I follow or the random girls that do porn on Twitter? Okay, well, I mean, there's a shout out to ASPX and Vines, ASPX and Vines. But I'm talking about the real people - the people that you're like, that bring joy to your life or bring something to your life that you're looking for, and also the people you'd want to give a shout out because they're doing a damn good job. I give a shout out... I give a shout out to uh, there's a few people I follow, like the ones that you know, you're I don't follow that many people, I'm not like some of you - I don't know how many how many people do you follow? A couple hundred really? Cuz I only follow like 60, like, and some of them are CNN, but the guys that I follow that I like... what well, you know, CNN and like Variety and things like that just for the actual news. What's",

What's your number? How many do you follow? 102,936. You follow N. How do you interact with that? That's like, such an absurd amount of people. I like it to be updated as fast as possible. I want a lot of stuff that's crazy, I need to digest. You could cut that down to like 250. No, if you're following the right people, they just don't tweet that much. It's not that bad. Exactly. There are people in there who don't tweet. Then you follow like I followed GameOverGreggy and then he tweets every 16 to 17 seconds, no, every like 30 minutes, so it's pretty intense. But um, it's pretty intense. There's a couple guys that I that I get a kick out of. I love following Mike Ducker, aka Mike Dukakis is one of mine. So fun. Mike at Mike Dukakis.

The Tonight Show - he works for The Tonight Show. He's really cool but we call him an **** cuz we're jealous. He's really funny, everything he says, he'll tweet in bursts which I think is hysterical and so he just has these random thoughts throughout the day and they're all self-deprecating, all incredibly sad unless you know him and then they're even sadder but they're really really funny.

Um, and then the other two guys that I follow that I try to look religiously for their tweets are uh Simon Pegg, the guy who played Scotty in Star Wars of the Dead, and uh Kevin Smith, who was my all-time idol; see, I follow Kevin yeah like Kevin Smith a lot, like his movies a lot. But a lot of I don't feel there's enough original content to his tweets; a lot of his tweets are like \"Hey, come watch us tonight at Hollywood Babylon\" or whatever.

It's Greg Miller from The GameOverGreggy Show. How do I say your last name? I say Melroy. Colin says Mroy, that's because that's how it's said. Well, I've been saying it wrong in the McKoy moment for like 90 orations. Where the hell were you? Beyond say hi, call back. Who you follow Kong, yeah who do I follow? I want to give a big shout out to Scott Bramble, my old roommate. He's funny; he doesn't tweet enough but he sometimes tweets some of the funniest stuff I've ever seen before like when he tweeted a selfie of him with a dead bird. Did you see this one?

I just... want to give a shout out to a few other random ass people. I had gone through a period where I unfollowed Bramble. Oh, really? Yeah, we just... I don't think he ever followed me. Don't think I'm not exactly... I am not a believer in... this isn't Twitter. I don't meet you so now I feel like I have to follow you - you get a try out sometimes and see what happens.
