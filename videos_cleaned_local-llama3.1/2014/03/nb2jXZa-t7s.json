I I I have like those instances in my life. One of the things that I remember my dad very vividly talking to me about when I was like 10 or 11 years old was... and I don't remember like what we were talking about this but I remember what he said to me: \"You know, if someone you know, what if someone's lying about you or like they don't know the truth about you or what you did.\" I don't remember exactly like what this was; someone was probably picking",

That comes to mind when I think about this kind of thing because you can't **** a goat, you can't take that back, can't take it back like you can't take it back. I mean, it's not like I would be like straight up, \"it just happens\" - you meet the goat and that would be it. Something. I mean, have to get to know the goat. I'm not going to just... what am I like from five years ago? I don't know. I mean, choose your goat, you can choose a goat. It's a goat. Yeah, you know.
