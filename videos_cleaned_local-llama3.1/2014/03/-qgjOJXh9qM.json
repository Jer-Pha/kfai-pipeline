So, okay, Grinder might have come first; I'm not too well-versed in this, but they are very similar things, so... well, but they're not. Okay, right. Correct me if I'm wrong. Give me some rope and let's see where I hang myself.\" Sure. Tinder is the one where it flags other singles; they pop up, you get to say hot or not, or whatever, and then you can communicate that way. Grinder is the one that's like \"I want sex right now\"; it shows, in a radius of how close somebody are to you, blah blah blah. Yes, but I'm pretty sure that Grinder is exclusively for gays; I had heard a rumor that it started out as both and then it just became super popular gay, so I'm not sure if it's just gay. I can check that from what I understand. Sign him up for it and see... uh... From what I understand of all this is happening is that Grinder um happened and I I",
