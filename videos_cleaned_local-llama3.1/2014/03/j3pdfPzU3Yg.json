And every once in a while, I like to watch the same movie over and over again. You know this is what Netflix is for - you can go on, find such classics as \"The Hunt for Red October,\" which is a phenomenal film. Um, you'll see it on AMC; I like to watch AMC every once in a while. What I like about watching the movie over and over is it's like listening to a song over and over again, right? The lines of each movie kind of become iconic for the actual thing, right? So what I wanted to ask you guys today - it's going to be a quick topic; we can just go around or say multiple ones. What are some of your favorite movie lines? Why do you do that? Am I doing everyone wrong? Yeah, really, you're very particular right now. Watch the watch the clip; you'll see. I'll watch... I don't watch anything with a favorite movie line. What is your Greg, what is one of your favorite",

Um, he realized I think there's a funny story behind the scenes on that where they realized about halfway through filming that Bill Murray and Chevy Chase never actually had a scene together so they wrote that random scene and like they wrote it the night before and shot at the next day where he hits the ball through Bill Murray's thing and he starts offering him whiskey and stuff. He's like, 'Nope,' or like, 'Moonshine' or whatever it was, and he's like, 'Okay, that's good.'

Um, one of my other favorite lines is from a movie that you guys probably haven't seen; it's a movie called Unforgiven. It's a Clint Eastwood Western, directed by him - I think it was one of the first things he directed. It's about a man who used to be an outlaw, used to be a really horrible human being, until he met a woman who kind of turned him around, and then she died, and he raised two kids with her, and his friend, one of his old gang members or one of the members of his",

He's raising two kids with her, and his friend - one of his old gang members or one of the members of his old gang comes back and says, \"Hey, there's this job we can go do.\" You're on a kind of a roll, like Dire Straits, and I know you promised your dead wife that you'd never do this again, never be that guy again, and never drink again - never be this horrible human killer. But we need this, and so... um, he goes and gets another member of his gang, actually this was a young kid then. He goes and gets the other member of his gang, and they go do this thing. But toward the end of it, they end up... spoilers... Morgan Freeman ends up getting whipped to death, and uh, because of this, it's a great story. But um, so that sends Clint Eastwood over the edge, and he ends up having this amazing moment where he hasn't had a drop of alcohol in forever, and then you just see this perspective of him.",

Nothing, but it's just such a cool, powerful moment because he's like, he's got Jean Reno and he's got a double-barreled shotgun in his head at the very end, and he goes \"I'll be back,\" and he goes \"Yeah,\" and then just... blows his head off. It's so good. So I just spoiled the end of that movie, but if you haven't seen it, it's worth a watch; that's it, cool.",
