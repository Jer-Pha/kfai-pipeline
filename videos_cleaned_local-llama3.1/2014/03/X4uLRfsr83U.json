But xXx was awesome excuse me thank you. Yeah he's always had star power he's always had star power. You don't put him in a role as a you know secondary character in a movie or something. I'm upset with this like I wish someone like him would stop so that things like The Expendables were even cooler, like the cameos and stuff like him being in it but The Expendables was cool when it first started and then they made a sequel, are they up to three now? They're making a fourth, I don't even know. But I mean like with the first one when they did that I was like oh that's funny and I never saw any of them I had",

I want to see him as Han Solo too, I don't mind that by the way. I saw a rumor today that Grand Moff Tarkin is in the new Star Wars movies, oh I hope that's true, I hope it's not just a rumor from Girls.

Rinzler book about A New Hope that I was mentioning earlier that they talk about how Alec Guinness, Tarkin's actor, didn't know that he died like that was not implicit in the script that like he dies because of the explosion and so it's you know they show it but like it doesn't say like that he dies so what was he looking for did he want like an RIP Grand Moe? well he was like the end of the movie The Credits roll and it's just like in memory of that that guy and um you know Alec Guinness were the only like two like super legitimate actors in the entire movie that that the guy play Grant M.

Vader invader sounds like ****, but he stopped, but he could totally squash him, but he didn't because he had a respect for Tarkin, cuz Tarkin was like Admiral Motti reminded him a lot of Padm\u00e9, I think that's really where it came down to. Well, I bet you, I bet you there was probably a father-son relationship there as they got older. You think so? I think so. I would like to know more about Tarkin; Tarkin would be cool to have that kind of origin story of Tarkin. I'm sure it's out there; I'm sure. They show him in episode three, they CGI'd him or whatever, they got someone to look like kind of like him at the end right? He walks up next to...
