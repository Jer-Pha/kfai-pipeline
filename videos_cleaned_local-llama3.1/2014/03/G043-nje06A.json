We have too many days going on right now - there's too much \"get it here on Friday\" and \"get it here on Monday.\" It's confusing. So what we're going to do is every Friday, the new brand-new you've never heard it before MP3 version of the show will go live on GameOverGreggy.com then over on YouTube.com/GameOverGreggy. Last week's episode, \"Stick With Me\" from The GameOverGreggy Show goes live. So like we're going to post in its entirety, one full video, then though it would have happened in then in a normal week what'll happen is that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are the broken-up topics - you get one video a day at 6:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time; everybody has fun, then Friday if you want it, the whole show goes live in there, one thing for you to watch however.",

Uh, in burritos, no, I actually thought it was kind of interesting and cool that people were like, \"I like the thing that you do so much.\" Yeah, that I'm kind of pissed you don't do it the same way because let's be honest; we kind of last week's episode was a little rough around the edges, right? That I really took offense with. Well, people really were like, \"Are you cut off in the middle of a conversation?\" I'm like, no, we were done talking about that; it was me moving the topic like I normally do.

I don't necessarily think that truthfully that that's the best idea either, because I feel like there's a redundancy to saying like now we have we have all the clips then just another video you know that's all but that's what they want yeah I guess I just what's wrong with the playlist I I don't want to bear because people don't use playlists it doesn't",

I make it sound cool cuz I make everything that's the whole problem is that there's no easy there's no right answer right like I don't want to do a show that's two and a half hours long and not have people watching hear the great topic that was in the last third of it you know what I mean like that's really upsetting and breaking them out does that exactly and that's what's really cool about breaking it out is we get to promote them five different ways, you still get your whole episode when when you want it but now if you're more interested in one of the\"",

Life will stop, and you're well aware of that. Yeah, we'll see. You're throwing around some barbs here. The TitanFall hour bet. I'm going to clearly get past that. I will play it again. I'm not worried, but I don't even care. I'm not even offended by that. The fact you bring Infamous into this shows what a little man you are. I really just did it to bother you, to be honest.
