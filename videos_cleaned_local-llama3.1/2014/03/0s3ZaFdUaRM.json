Uh, in burritos, no, I actually thought it was kind of interesting and cool that people were like, \"I like the thing that you do so much.\" Yeah, that I'm kind of pissed you don't do it the same way because let's be honest; last week's episode was a little rough around the edges, right? That I really took offense with. Well, people really were like, \"Are you cut off in the middle of a conversation?\" I'm like, no, we were done talking about that; it was me moving the topic like I normally do.

By the way, this is why I love Colin; he has no in between - it's either zero or we're burning the **** down. Burning... I just love that it's Colin saying this. The guy's like \"I'm playing Dang and Rompa\" instead of going out to hang out with his friends. His friends do something every weekend, he never goes out. This is part of the reason why I envy you guys for loving video games so much. I wish I did because you can buy a game and that's 40 sometimes 20 to 40 hours of your life that you can not have to go out and spend more money on drinking or like hanging out with people that you're like \"yeah, I see them all the time.\" So like me if I'm like \"I'm going to go see a movie\" I'm like \"well dude what are you doing afterward?\" I'm like \"sh was kind of like a borderline Shawn fan get impression was it yeah bring up the movies then yeah fting in I guess so anyway but yeah I I",

Greg is gonna play Titanfall for maybe 10 or 15 hours cumulatively, you said 10, you said 10 in your bet, hours you said 10 in your bet here's another bet yeah by the time March ends Greg will never play Titanfall ever again let's see unless he has to do it for work and Greg, you're bringing the mic again I'm a little distressed that while Titanfall is a great game and everyone's having a lot of fun with it, it's be engaging.",

I'm sure he; I hear very little about Infamous out of Greg's future plans. When Greg and I bonded very much on inFamous and inFamous 2, and now inFamous: Second Son is coming out on PlayStation 4 on March 21st, and I don't hear much about Greg's plans. What to be playing this game now the best; now I'm a little concerned and confused about this because you know, is it because Cole's not in the game? Is it because... I can explain all this. I can explain all this. Wait, let me, let's let's hear you want to hear more of his theories because I think there's a term I don't know if this is the correct term okay and it's might not be the term I'm looking for but there's a term that comes to mind called the turncoat; is that what's happening?

It's an easy platinum trophy, the first one, but the trophies were really hard. I don't even know why we're talking about this, but here's the thing: there's been a lot of hype about Titanfall in Greg's life and I just don't feel like we did it justice. We did do four hours of Infamous content today for work, though - we did do that. But I set all that up now, and in days past, Infamous looks awesome by the way. I should say it does look good; it does look really good. I'm just busting balls anyway. Titanfall looks **** awesome if I was into online games.",

I played a little bit, it crashed, I was like, \"I'm done.\" GTA Online is basically what the world would turn into if there were no rules and there were no real consequences. I'm convinced it just would turn into horrible things. I like this No Man's Sky, it's a good game. Oh, it's really good. Yeah, I've never had it before. A little bit. Here's my prediction about Titanfall: by the way, here we go. It will be with the exception of like the big guns, like maybe Call of Duty or something, the best-selling game of the year and cumulatively the platform, yeah, yeah, with Xbox 360 and PC as well.
