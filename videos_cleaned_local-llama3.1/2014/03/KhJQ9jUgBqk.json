I was gonna just go on to sing the entire time, I know, and we're going to get a copyright strike 'cause you're so good at my mouth. So this song, this song's been out for a while; it's making it all the ground in the clubs, and um, it is a trap song, but this is an old song. I thought I've heard the song for a long time; it's been it's been out for like for a while, but it's one of those things where you know songs they come out and then it's like, \"Is it a hit? Is it do people like it?\" And then eventually they're like, \"Oh, yeah, they do like,\" and then they make the music video, and then it goes. Yeah, that's where we're at right now; like this is this is the blow, like that happens with Miley a lot, am I wrong about that one? Well, Bangers came out, she put out like a million songs, and then she had like a new video every two weeks, and like 'cause I didn't hear about it.",
