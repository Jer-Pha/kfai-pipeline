And I remember, I remember being uh, I owed a ton of money - I still owe a lot of money, I owed like 50 something thousand for school, which is really nothing because my tuition was free, this was just for my room and board um, because you know my mom worked at Northeastern so my tuition was covered.

Like, I have to worry about real things now. Because when you make money in college, I remember, I'd have... I never had more than $1,000 dollars in the bank at any time when I was in college. And when I had $1,000 in the bank, I was like, \"What in the ****? Like, I've got to spend this. How am I even doing with all this money?\" I could buy a GameCube. Yeah, I'd have to go drink and you know be stupid with my friends and go to a 311 concert or something. Buy like five pieces of merch or something.

So um, that was when I realized that I was, you know, a grown-ass man. I think mine was similar. I think it was the time when I, after I graduated, I just me and a friend went into business together; we bought a camera, I bought a camera, he bought a uh computer on credit cards, and we were like struggling to pay the you know roughly $2,000 a piece we owed on the credit cards.

Uh-oh, how am I going to do this?\" Right? And then I think in that same month or that same period I got like a flat tire and I was like, \"**** I gotta... I got... I got to figure out a way to come up with $300 to buy a tire.\" And you know, and then you go and you have that experience where the guy's like, \"Well, you know, you should get all four new tires because it's not good to just get...\" And I'm like, \"I just need one tire.

You're H in a Marshall M, yes, yeah. Um, so all that I was interested in that stuff; I'm also interested in video games. There's a website GameFAQs.com - always would go to that stuff. There's a rap and hip-hop board there, would always look at that, and one day I saw a thread that was \"Hip-Hop Video Game Samples\" and I was like, \"I'm into this.\" Click on it, and there's just like a bunch of songs - like, oh, this samples this song, this samples this... And there was one called \"Line Drop\" that samples the Tetris song. The idea behind the song was that so when you play Tetris, those of you at home who don't remember Tetris as being like the L what this Angry Birds sound like - that Candy Crush continues to do you even know what Candy Crush is?

I've not played it, but I know it's a cultural phenomenon, whatever it'll come and go. So in Tetris, when the lines would drop, don't call me out of my name - I hate when you do that. He does it all the time; he likes really getting to the point now where you're doing you have the drink in your hand while you like... don't call me out, son of a gun, that's not how you know me. Continue, Tim. Sorry, but so as the lines would drop in Tetris, the music gets faster right?

It's by a group called E-40 (Extended Family), four underground rappers that don't mean anything to me, but what I know is that those four rappers would be like the most influential people in my entire life. This guy led by this guy, Too Short - The Archetype. Yeah, it's just an album. It's a rap album that... it just you know, I can't really talk about it without it just sounding like I'm just saying \"it's great.\" You just told everybody to buy it, I'm saying but without saying just big words, man - it changed my life and all this stuff, but it's just like it was the moment that I was like, \"Man, hip-hop music is more than just 'oh, it's hip-hop music' it's...\"",
