I'm Greg Miller, and this is my roommate Colin Moriarty. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at them, and we talk it out for your amusement. If you like that, like the video, share it with your friends, subscribe to us on YouTube. Col are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is how to pick up women - this is from Mirthrandir804: How to Pick Up Women. How to pick up women. I think first and foremost it's cliche to say it's all about confidence; you got to fake it till you make it. Greg Miller never really was confident, but if he has to talk to somebody and act like he's talking to somebody and he knows what he's doing, he'll do it. Yeah, this is what you got to do - you got to go, be brave. Yeah, confidence is totally key. Somebody said what was it",

I'm G going to screw this quote up, but basically, like, going be you know going out and doing something that you know you can do and having no qualms about it, that's not brave, like being Brave is being scared of doing what you're doing, so there you go, that's what you've got to do, go talk to them, it's just have a conversation with women, yeah, I think I think this goes for picking up men too, I think you know there's a few things that are important, uh, I think you know you have to the confidence thing is really important, I also think the respect thing is really important too, sure, you know women, there's so many guys out there that just disrespect women and I don't think that that's cool as a guy and I don't think women like that, I think that there are some women that like that and I don't think you",

I think that there are some women that like that, and I don't think you want to be with a woman like that. Um, um, and you know the one thing I always realize is I always feel like I've always you know I was always like going after girls like that who were out of my league, and it worked over and over again. And like what I understand about that is that confidence really is at the core of that - that you have to portray a certain confidence in yourself, a certain humor about yourself, sort of almost self-deprecating in a way. Um, that's why we're good at it, yeah. And like you know this happened, you know I remember like my first date was with girls in high school, but the girl I dated for a couple years in high school, I met her - she was a figure skater and I was a hockey player, and we met at the rink. There is a movie about this, maybe I don't know.",

Or what isn't there a movie about this? Maybe I don't know - no Cutting Edge, that's what I'm thinking of. There so there's a movie about it, and I remember you know, talking to her the first time, and just making her laugh, and like putting that seed in her head where she was like \"she'd remember me\" because I was a funny guy. I had my through some of the jokes. I don't ice sure is cold ain't it? It's like I just have my goalie... like you know goalies carry their stick in their bag, but they also carry their leg pads over their shoulder too - they can't fit them in so you look like a badass, you look like an athletic badass. Yeah, I'm like hulking around and and we were just talking; she gave me I gave her yeah, she... I'll just give you my number, I had to go play or whatever and she",

No, we both have... we both have... we both have beautiful girlfriends, and like, um, who have no business being with us. No, and like I think that we're, you know, you know, punching above our weight or whatever, and uh, but I think that's common, like people always say those kinds of things, like look at this guy that this girl's with. Well, like, that guy might be awesome, you know? You're judging him based on his looks not who he is, what his character is, and stuff like that. And so I think you put that kind of stuff out in the forefront it overrides like all of the aesthetic issues you might have, you know? I think that's what's most important. So be confident. I mean, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take if you go off and talk to somebody and doesn't go well, big deal, who cares that person doesn't matter. But you know what I mean, like you went up and tried to talk to somebody you thought looked cool and they weren't.\"",
