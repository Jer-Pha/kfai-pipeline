Subscribe to our channel and share us with your friends. Colin, are you ready? Yep. Today's topic of conversation is what celebrity would you most like to meet, submitted by @MatthewBlack. Celebrity, yeah, celebrity. I don't know, think about it, think hard. I am. I'm thinking. I can start tossing out names if you want okay. I know you like... the Celebrity Apprentice, Donald Trump, uh, you like the President usually? So not and I mean like the presidential office. I'd like to meet Barack Obama. It's not definitely the person I'd like to meet the most. Yeah, I like to tell him how much he **** everything up.",

Yeah, that's important. Yeah, see part of our democracy is really a republic, but it's respecting the office. You can't disrespect like remember when um Joe Wilson from South Carolina, the congressman screamed \"You lied\" during the State of the Union. You can't do that no because you gotta win some and you lose some. Republicans at this rate are going to lose every one of them, but you can't disrespect the president. We've had terrible Presidents. Obama is not a good President. Everyone knows that. Everyone has buyer's remorse on this man. Romney would win if the election was held today. All the polls show that. I predicted Romney would definitely win, so I was totally wrong. Not a chance.",

They were like, \"What do you think, Barack Obama will be reelected?\" I'm like, \"Not a chance,\" nailed it. Nailed that the Vita sales - you're always on it, man. I predicted those VA sales, you know almost one to one... um no so no I wouldn't dis I I ski Rick oh Chris Jericho, Chris Jericho star... um I don't know I I I don't what about 311? Oh yeah, I met all those guys. Oh did you did I ever tell you the story about when I saw 311 in 2006 on 311 Day in Memphis, Tennessee? No you did not so I was with my buddies we drove down to Memphis this is the second 311 day I went to I went to the one in New Orleans in 2004 and we were hanging out we were in a hotel the show was that night and we were getting all **** up",

So this is an interesting story; there's another story; there's another layer to this, and I have nothing to do with this other story. But we so love meeting celebrities, most like to meet 311. No, here's the 311 story: Here's another 311 rabbit hole. Uh, Creed's lead singer, yeah Scott Stapp, right? He's like a total alcoholic; really, he lives in LA, confirmed well. He, he, he likes a heavy drinker; I don't know if he is anymore. This was like maybe this story is like 10 years ago okay, and 311's at a bar, like the Hollywood Bowl somewhere yeah, and they're with their wives, and Scott Stapp uh disrespects, like says something awful to one of 3's wives, and the three 1's rapper punched him in his face and broke his hand.",

And when we had seen them it was like a month or so after this and I I'll never forget the rapper from 3-6 Mafia when I went to shake his hand gave me his left hand because his right hand was still messed up and Sh my hand like that and I was like it's because you messed that dude from Creed up. I don't hate Creed, I actually like Creed's first couple records but uh you know I know it's cool to hate Creed but I don't I don't care uh so yeah I would like to you know that was really that was a really cool moment for me like to be able to meet them and talk to them and they they meet a lot of people and they but but I love them and so it was and that was when they were still good so it was it was uh it was cool to meet them but as far as I don't know I mean I'm not like much.",

You think I think Ben Franklin would be very inquisitive and very interested; yeah, he's a scientist, I mean he's a naturalist, he's a man of of you know of intellect and education. I feel like I often think about bringing guys from the 18th century up to yes that's what I think about all the time too bring him an iPad, bring and what would they think? I think that a lot of them would be scared; a lot of them bust you oh jeez it's one of these I do you mean it's one of these the only sneeze I do yeah you never sneeze once um I think like you know if you gave Henry Lee a **** iPad, I don't think he wouldn't have any",

I think with Ben Franklin, he'd be like, he'd be intrigued by everything he saw. He could manage this, yeah. I think he'd have a lot of questions, yeah. I think it would be interesting to tell him like you know when you hypothesized that lightning was actually electricity and you proved it with your key and your kite. Yeah, well that's powering everything here now and uh and we still rever you based on you know that. Yeah, you know we still that's the symbol to us actually that's that's the thing I'm most interested in with the founders and like like it's like we kind of worship you like we have like a very unique thing in the United States where we actually have like hero worship with real people.\"",

But our country is so new compared to a lot of European countries or whatever, we have like a group of people that we are crazy over who lived at the same time and stuff. And I always say that the Revolutionary War period is remarkable how many smart people lived at the same time, and I wonder if we would lose them to history too, like if we wouldn't appreciate them as much as we do about how bold and intelligent they were. Yeah, Alexander Hamilton for instance - Alexander Hamilton was raised in the West Indies, largely self-taught, super smart, you know, but would he have gotten the shine if the revolution didn't happen?

I'm saying that I would die and then become the Grim Reaper right but still be chill. It'd be cool when like Benjamin Franklin, I assume died on a deathbed right? How'd he die? He died, yeah you know he died of illness around his family or whatever, but I'm going to be like when he dies I'm the I'm the ghost in the room that takes his spirit but then I get to talk, I get to talk to him.",

Oh, so you're to their own choices exactly, cuz like what I'm saying is I don't, I I can't go on his deathbed and show him the iPad or whatever, then I'm going to screw up the time frame, like I I I can't stop time and talk to him because his time would keep going so he would die earlier than he should have. You know what I mean? Like he wouldn't get to say goodbye or something stupid like that. And in the same way, I can't go and pull him here when he was healthy. I can't take him from back then and bring him here when he's healthy because then he still has more to live and he'd tell everybody he'd **** everything up. Grandfather Parx exactly.

They wrote about him in hindsight, but he was real, and I'd be interested to just witness him and see what that was all about. Yeah, because he had this little thing going on when he was alive, but it wasn't until several generations later that he took off. Yeah, like people wrote about him and stuff, like the Gospels are written by people who weren't witnesses on the ground. This Jesus thing - see what's up.
