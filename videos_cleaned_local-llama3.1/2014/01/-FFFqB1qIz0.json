Every Wednesday and Friday, I take one of your YouTube comments or tweets to me and have a conversation with you about it. So make sure you're commenting down there and talking to me. Yeah, it's fun. Uh, today's stuff comes from at MK 074 uh he asks who would be my cast in an Invincible movie? If I had unlimited money and they were giving me the script to make Robert Kirkman's Invincible - one of the best superhero comic books out there - you have to go read it, please go read it. You know, stick with it because it starts off and you're just like, \"Oh, it's just a superhero comic,\" and it gets awesome; it just gets awesome. It's been going on forever now over 100 issues, congratulations. Um, what would my cast look like? So I wrote some of it down here, I jotted it down right. We got to start with First Mark Grayson, Invincible himself. Right, Zachary Levi - no, wait, Zack Efron; stick with me. I like Zack Efron, good-looking kid, funny kid. He's got that new movie coming out, I've already",

            "text": "Mark's like Superman's son, his name is Invincible. Anyways, Omnipotent Man, who else but the one and only Tom Hiddleston? Right it makes sense right if you read Invincible, you know that Omni-Man is of course defined by that awesome mustache right, and we all know Tom Hardy has an awesome mustache, but Tom Hardy's also a big dude; he's a bulky dude. You can see him being an older version of a superhero right, a Superman. That's what we need here for the father figure. We need Tom Hardy, ladies and gentlemen, for the Invincible movie. Thank you for your blank chat, Robert Kirkman, I'm making you quite the film here. Up next, who's going to be Eve Adam? Eve Mark's love interest of course. Um, I got to go. Emma Stone here, I know Emma Stone's in Spider-Man already; I know she's blonde right now but Adam Eves is this you know fun uh smart sexy redhead right. Emma Stone would nail that; she'd knock it out of the park cuz I'm not even thinking about her Spider-Man works so much as EA did you see EA, that movie was awesome.",

We're thinking about bone structure, and we're thinking about: Is this a believable cast for the Graysons? Yeah, totally. Next up is Cecil, now I know Cecil comes into play a bit later if you're up on the Invincible story. I'm going to try to combine a lot of things going on here right now. I want Cecil \u2013 who, of course, is in charge of the Pentagon; he's in charge of basically the government \u2013 he's going to be the dude who gives the marching orders to Omni-Man and Invincible for most of the movie. Uh, I'm going to have Steve Buscemi play him. Steve Buscemi does such a great job as just a guy, but then it turns out he's the most powerful in the world. We love him in Boardwalk Empire, now right? I mean, just imagine him taking that kind of character to the present and having all sorts of teleporting technology.",

I think he can play it really well. So ladies and gentlemen, that is my casting for the Invincible movie which doesn't exist. God knows why they haven't made it. Why there isn't an Invincible video game. Why there isn't an Invincible cartoon. I am Robert Kirkman has all this money now right, he's succeeded with The Walking Dead. Let's pour some of it into Invincible. I'm begging you. I want to know though, this is a conversation between us, what do you want from an Invincible movie? Who would you cast in an Invincible movie? Why do you read Invincible? Let me know in the comments then make sure you like this video and share it.",
