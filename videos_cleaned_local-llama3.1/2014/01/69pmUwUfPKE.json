Like, Gene Wilder is awesome in that movie, and like from top to bottom, that movie is timely and funny still. I was watching, I was showing other scenes because one of my favorite scenes is when Augustus Gloop is introduced and they're in the restaurant in Germany and they're talking to the dad and they're like \"Mr., you know Mr. Gloop, do you have anything to say?\" And he just eats the microphone and it's like",

But when they made the remake, or not the sequel, in 2005, I was in college. Johnny Depp was in it, and I actually went to see that movie on opening day. And I was so disappointed in that movie because I thought Johnny Depp plays the same character in every movie he's in, from Edward Scissorhands all the way to Pirates of the Caribbean. It's the same character. I will say I disagree with you that Edward is a good actor, I think an Edward Scissorhands which I watched when I was a kid did",

Later in life, I think what's happened to Johnny Depp is that he did Captain Jack and kind of got locked into that - I think from there on yeah he's been like his Lone Ranger guy just from the trailers cuz nobody obviously saw that movie well. And I also think that the problem with the original was... Did I interrupt you? No, I have nothing really to say.

And that's what I was most disappointed with was there wasn't that depth to the character that really, really... you know, sort of was put in the movie to explore all those themes right? Explore all the craziness of like... and the kids weren't even just it wasn't about even just the kids so much it was but those were Society parents to it was the parents right it was the gluttony it was the craziness of wealth and what that did to kids.

That speech when he gives these are the keys right away, yeah, like throws them on the table, he's like \"Who took the Section 8 test\" or whatever it was, and then people get the hell out of here. It was a cheap ripoff of Glen Gary... oh yeah, for sure. Coffee is for closers. Put that coffee down. But didn't they reference that movie specifically? And uh, they referenced that movie specifically, and um, the iconic one, they just made a sequel for, um, Street... yeah, um. Phenomenal movie, that's good speech.
