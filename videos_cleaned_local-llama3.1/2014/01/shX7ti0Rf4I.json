It's good to see you. It's good to see you, you look good today. Thank you. The beard, we're getting on that borderline where it's gotta go. I gotta shave. Are you becoming part of the club? Are you joining the club? It's a good club? Join it. No, this is the club, this is the ladies club. It's weird that when I think beard, I'm like, Nick has a beard, never do I think Tim has a beard. There you go. Tim's not committed to the beard. This is gonna be gone soon. We'll start over. You're literally great at everything. You are so active. I'm very mediocre at everything. I excel at nothing. The producer, Nick Scarpino. Hey everyone. Hey, how you doing? Thanks for joining us. Good looking beard",

It was a healthy thing. She liked it, I liked it. We were being safe. We were doing all this stuff that we were supposed to do. And we would have those conversations of, should we go out, should we go to that party, or should we have sex?
