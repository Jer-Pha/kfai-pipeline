Um, but yeah, it was all right. I mean, there you know, there was I liked being an only child. I liked having nice things and everything else. And the kids I always saw who had siblings, they always had like the extreme it seemed right. Like, there's one kid I went to school with, Eric, he had like five other brothers right? And so their house was just a train wreck all the time. It was just kids screaming. There was always another baby like... he you know, there was like he never felt like he was getting enough time or whatever it felt like or stuff like that. I don't know.
