I mean he's so funny and so talented. To actually get to meet him and have a real one-on-one is like there's so many things I never expected to happen. That's definitely one of them, right? Like I never really expected growing up that you'd meet the Ghostbusters or whatever and talk to them and have like a personal conversation with them, not just like a handshake and an autograph and a \"see you later.\" That was crazy, right? And then, uh, you know, as far as like defining what my day job and stuff is right, like for me growing up I was the biggest EGM fan, like I was all about EGM magazine.

It's like okay, and that's what got me a Sega kid number one, terrible, terrible look at that but the Ghostbusters game was really good, right?

Like, I would have had a later start, probably would have been a Nintendo kid, been brainwashed with the rest of you or whatever.
