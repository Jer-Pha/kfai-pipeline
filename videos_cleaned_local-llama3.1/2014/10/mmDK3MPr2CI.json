The only the only good thing that came from it, right aside from the next two, which got progressively better, I think I think we've talked a little bit no, was the fact they made me a horse. It kept Star Wars in the public eye long enough for it you know it reinvigorated it kept the series going and now we're going to get what I think are going to be some freaking awesome Star Wars. I hope so.

Honey, we should do we should do like commentaries or some sort of we should go back and watch those and do something with them, the original trilogy, and like go back and revoice them that would be good just to see if we can get a little more racist sure tration Jesus Christ, just white people the entire time.

I still say that before on the show, and I still think that the way it's shot, and like the one with Short Round, yeah... but when they're in the club and stuff like that, it's so good. There's a lot of dudes - Indiana Jones is the coolest character, man! Like he is such an awesome character, and the fact that Harrison Ford was going between playing Han Solo and Indiana Jones - they're basically the same character; one has a Starship, the other one has just his horse and his intellect.

He's a boring character, and the only reason that anyone gives a damn about that character, the way that they care about him to this day, in terms of one of the great villain tellings in a movie, it's because what happened to the actor.
