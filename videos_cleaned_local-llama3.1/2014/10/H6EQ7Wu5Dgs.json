You've got the first thing Nick ever taught me about being on video: don't wear a pattern shirt. It's \"don't wear tight patterns.\" Yeah, so I'm still wearing this, but I'm wearing is this a tight pattern? Does this count as a tight pattern? Uh, I don't think I'm moring... I don't know. Kev, could you tell on my can you? Is my shirt look all wobbly? I mean, don't know. This is a new camera, so I don't know if the rolling sh... Sean Finnegan, who's here, will be able to answer all of our camera needs. You skipped all the thing; you ski the reason you're fine, you're you're Lally guest, you're allowed to say whatever you want to say.

But I feel like quarries are really the star in young adult fiction. It seems like somebody's always drowning in the quarry, something bad's always happened at the quarry. Back me up here: some short stories you read about the quarries. The only rock quarry I can think of right now is from Garden State; they go \"Shout at the Devil\" this is just something the young people do in movies and TV shows, I think. Well, you got a lot of angst, yeah, you got to have some place to shout where no one can hear you, but then maybe someone can hear you, and then they're like, \"I've always been in love.\"",

What happens when you put the hot dog, like when you remember when you were kids and you just wanted a hot dog but you didn't do the bun to hot dog ratio correctly when you bought them so you had the hot dog only, no, you only have like you had like one hot dog left then you made that's when you made the hot dog sandwich. So you can't put a sandwich inside of a sandwich, no, but you're looking at it all wrong; you're looking at it all wrong. It isn't Inception, but you're looking at it from the wrong point of view.
