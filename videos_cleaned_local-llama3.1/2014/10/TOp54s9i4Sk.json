So my topic came from a little bit of background research. We all read Wikipedia - Colin and I were talking off the air about it, but like you know those Wikipedia holes that you get sucked into. You jump on the site, and you're researching or reading about something you're interested in, and then all of a sudden something else pops up, and it's a hyperlink. You just open that new tab, think you're there for a second, then you're on a different topic, then you're on a cow zone, then you're on a pizza. So this came out of one of those Wikipedia holes. I had watched an episode of Cosmos, and uh Neil deGrasse Tyson was talking about how the genius among geniuses was this guy Isaac Newton, and I thought it was really interesting. So I went on Wikipedia and started reading about Isaac Newton, and I got sucked into this more scientific mathematical hole about all these things that I don't understand.",

I think as my outlook on it yeah see I guess that's the thing is like if you went to Pluto and there's aliens there right and they're talking about gravity everything they might call different things right it's not going to be what was it meters you said 9.8 meters yeah it's not going to be like that right it'll be something else so the act so I guess that's the question then is we making a distinction between the actual like symbols and uh arithmetic that we use to calculate the laws but what about the laws themselves like no the laws are natural there we go so if they've always existed and have existed since before we were around must have been something we discovered right yeah we discovered it we discovered math because",

I think we're on the same page here being rational people, yeah, I don't understand, I don't understand that argument simply because think about it like this: splitting an atom right like there's a way to split the atom and we're not the only civilization that split the atom certainly in the Galaxy or in the universe; the math to get to that point must be identical, it's just a matter of like how you express it but like the answer is the same, you know, like it's the same as two 1 plus 1 equals 2, it's the same as you know splitting the atom is the same as by the way I said Isaac Newton invented trigonometry, invented calculus, uh get out broke ass, but uh like like but there the like",
