It was good. It was good. I feel like I could have done better; I feel like I could have done more. Hindsight 2020, you know? But here I am at 30 years old. I can't believe it.

And here are you know they have little blurbs from like people there's a few really interesting ones um from people that have read the book and stuff. So here's one from Stuart Russell, professor of Computer Science at Berkeley: \"Nick Bostrom makes a persuasive case that the future impact of AI is perhaps the most important issue the human race has ever faced. Instead of passively drifting, we need to steer a course.\" And that's one by Martin Rees, past president of the Royal Society: \"Those who are disposed to think about the long-term future should be concerned about the potential risks of advanced artificial intelligence.\"",

So, it basically comes down to it being saying that the book's really interesting because it makes the case that this is more important than environmentalism, this is more important than you know all of these issues that we deal with because it's imminent and like we are going to make intelligence that can start to think for itself and evolve and it's going to be a problem for us, you know, and we don't think about it because we",
