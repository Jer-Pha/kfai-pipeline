So my topic's kind of going along with the video game theme this week, right now I A lot of people are currently saying that we're in the uh the era of comic book movies right so you've got a comic movie coming out basically every six months which is awesome which is great. I mean when I was a kid I would have died to live to grow up in a time like now, I'm not just saying that cuz the internet mostly it's just because the movies are so phenomenally uh these days and the porn... And my question to you guys is there was almost we were on the precipice of another era about two years ago when two years ago sorry four years ago probably years maybe five years ago um... Spit it out. When Neil Blomkamp was developing a script for Halo, the Halo movie, and that was going to be a big deal because Peter Jackson was backing it, and if you read the history behind that it's really fascinating um how horribly that fell apart because apparently",

So, and that's going to happen with video games because the video game industry is only getting bigger; the movie industry is only smaller in comparison. So there's going to be a convergent point where mainstream culture goes, and it just needs one big breakout movie for all the studios to jump on board and say we're going to start buying up all these properties. But I feel like that's already happened; most of them aren't good. A lot of the comic movies aren't good either. So case in point: if they made a Halo movie, mhm, and Peter",

I think maybe in the next year or two we're going to see that Breakaway from comic book movies and hit that really hard, hit that splash of video game movies. I feel like we're ignoring like a lot of like Resident Evil the movie series is huge and it sucks; it made a lot of money, made a lot of money and success, but for every person who enjoyed those sucked, but it was successful. Was it a success? They didn't make a sequel, yeah, but I mean that's cuz they're busy making pirate sequels okay how many more pirate sequels are they going to make? Prob like 10; didn't they do a new trilogy AR? They're working on a new trilogy probably. I don't think Prince of Persia is coming back, that's what I'm saying, like none of these movies like when a movie is that good it does warrant a sequel. If Prince of Persia or any of those films well with the exception of Resident Evil where they're like dovic is just killing it let's just keep",

Oh, I love Alicia Vikander. D, yeah, she's excellent. So hot. Both of them together, dynamic. You're asking when is the successful one? When is the critically acclaimed one? When are video game movies going to be taken as seriously - in quotes - as comic books? They're when are they going to be as mainstay as comic book movies now? And what would it take to get them there? See, I don't think it's not an easy answer. Like I think your best bet right now is The Last of Us. Neil Druckmann is writing it; they're involved right now. It's not like Uncharted, which was very much from what we heard Mark Wahlberg and this guy are doing it - no, no, they're trying to get Bradley Cooper; they're talking to him seriously, I guess.

Um, but to me, like I don't think there's any risk in in Call of Duty because Call of Duty sells what 15 or 20 million units uh a year, so that's going to be that's going to resonate with people and their friends and their friends' friends and just gamers in general, morbid curiosity probably would get people into the theater but that always surprises me. Battlefield is another one; like you just developed the story of for Call of Duty, just develop the story of Ghost I think the story of Ghost is actually pretty interesting there's a lot of really cool set pieces in that game um in space and in like all these different locations on earth um an Uncharted movie would be fun, you know to me like there hasn't been a major IP movie with the",
