Uh, I've been a big supporter of Comixology; it was something I'd had been calling for a long time. It's the reason I bought my iPad to read comics digitally, not to have to collect comics to be happy reading them digitally, spending way too much money on comics. Tim, you do this as well. Nick, you've just begun. I have; I've just ventured into that. They got bought by Amazon not too long ago last month - big news. Oh cool, they got bought by Amazon. Everybody's like, \"Amazon's going to ruin them,\" and we're all like, \"It'll be fine.\" Uh, they release a new app; they close their old app, yeah it's not even an update by the way. No, it's not even an update. They closed their old app, create a new app - you have to go into and log in, and the big thing is that there is no store anymore inside it on the on the digital iOS front or the Android front for",

The fact that I'm reading comics and I want to read the next comic but I have to go to the website or whatever blah blah blah. But then you think about it, and really it's just the screw job - no offense - of the in-app purchases working that 30% of an in-app purchase needs to go to Apple right? So for Amazon to come in sell things through Kindle, sell through Comixology now it makes sense for them to force you to this. And at first again yeah like I get the knee-jerk reaction but I won't be able - I mean like the guy who wrote Punisher and did all this stuff created Punisher, he's had a long diet... no, thesis on why this is horrible right?

Right when new comics come out on Wednesday, I just have to change my mindset from \"well, I'll get them when I get home\" to \"I'll check it out on a lunch break and see what I want to buy this week and click click click and be done.\" Also, comiXology, a few months ago before the Amazon acquisition introduced subscriptions. Where I love Invincible and I love The Walking Dead and I love a bunch of other series, so I just click a button and I'm subscribed now, so I auto-buy those every time they come out, every Wednesday that they come out of the month.

By the way, I dropped when they had a sale; I dropped $40 on comic books. I bought like 40 issues just because I marathoned through these things why? Because you don't stop to think right? You just go do that too. Oh, I got to get the next one, oh I got to... and the only thing that stopped me was that I was literally falling asleep, and I'm like, \"Uh okay, I'll table this until tomorrow.\" So I think it's going to hurt their business considerably in the short term; I'm sure Amazon has a plan because if there's one company that can go out there and actually take on Apple, it's Amazon right?

To I want to point out this, that on the Android app you can still pay through Google with PayPal yeah PayPal only but jumping back to what I was saying earlier it's Jerry Conway thanks for reloading that while I was reading it uh co-creator of The Punisher he had this whole thing put up about how and the first line is \"And so as we could have predicted Amazon Comics, and it's this whole thing\" and what he brings up is interesting to the fact that he loves comic shops but they're dying right and that this was Comixology, the perfect portal to get people into comics.
