I told her I was going to be gone for a week, after a week and a half she called me and was like, \"I know you're back; you should call me again.\" I was like, \"Oh, she knows; she knows everything.\" Yeah, she was really challenging. The thing about the thing I've realized in dating over time is that the games are played on both sides, and both sides are cognizant of the games. What we could all use a lot more of is just straight-up honesty with each other to avoid like... the calling thing, the texting thing - like if someone texts you, it's okay to text them back.

So like when they're combined together, they sound like awesome friends; well, they do; they do; they sound like girlfriends, no; they do it as a joke. Like when I saw Nate, he's like, \"You know, you know, you're looking all right or whatever,\" and then Baradon knows it bothers me, and like that, they do it on purpose. But so Baron, when I went before Nate got married, we all had to go buy suits, so I went and bought my suit with Nate because we were both in the wedding party. Oh yeah, I've seen these pictures, and I am Facebook friends with Baradon; seriously, he helped me get the perfect suit, was like very patient; he was great; it's like Nick when Nick dressed me for a fancy conversation; he bought me nice jeans and stuff, and he walked me around Levi's.",

I can't put anything in it. Explains that explains so much. You're right though, the tailoring is really important when I so when I bought the suit with Baradon, he was like, \"You got to go bring this to a Taylor and you know fix X Y and Z.\" So I go to the place Sundown, like down the street. They're really awesome down there. It's a nice, you know, Mom and Pop cleaner. And I go, I go to the woman, and I'm like, \"I think I need you to add like a quarter of an inch to the waist.\" And she looks at me and she goes, \"Half an inch,\" and then she writes it down or whatever. I'm like, \"Perfect, thank you.\" Oh my God, I had a very similar experience. I bought my suit when I got married, and of course, when you get married, you're like, \"I'm going to work out; look great.\" Didn't lose as much as I wanted to the trap they call.",

They call it the wedding diet. So, I did it, but I didn't lose as much weight as I wanted to. Then about eight months later, Chris O'Quinn said, \"Hey, you want to officiate my wedding?\" And I was like, \"Sure,\" but I want to wear this suit because it's a daytime wedding; it's a blue suit \u2013 you know, it'll look good. So, I go check out the suit, and it doesn't quite fit anymore. And I take it to my tailor in the neighborhood, uh, lovely woman, and she happens to be Chinese. I'm not saying that Chinese people are more blunt, but she was specifically blunt with me because I was like, \"How much should we take it out?\" And her answer, which I will never forget, was, \"All the way \u2013 we should take it all out.\" She wasn't kidding; she wasn't kidding.
