Garnish with an Orange Twist\n\n*For the simple syrup just mix equal parts warm water and raw cane sugar and stir until it dissolves. We use gum syrup.\n\n**For the rye you ideally want something between 45%-50% ABV.  Sazerac 6yr, Rittenhouse 100 or Bulleit Rye all work really well.  \n\n***If you decide to make it with bourbon instead, do a lemon twist instead of orange. \n===================================\nEach and every Friday, Greg Miller, Colin Moriarty, Nick Scarpino, and Tim Gettys get together to talk.

Super swank bar. Yeah, that's great. He was gone. He's actually in Kentucky, I think, attending to some bourbon. Most likely if you're in Kentucky, that's what you're gonna be doing.

It took about a year and a half for me to finally make one. I did. It was delicious. We love old fashions.

I'm talking about when you were a stupid kid and you drank for the first time. What's wrong? Where are all the big ice cubes? Only have three of them. There's three in there. We didn't refill it last night after we had three old fashions. I'll take the little cubes. No, I'm giving you the good stuff. I need one big ice cube per glass, right, to make it perfect.
