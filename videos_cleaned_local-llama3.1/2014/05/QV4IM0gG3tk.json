This tag from Eagle Rare, oh please do, I'm drinking Eagle Rare, it's great bourbon, it's a little expensive but you should drink it, it's good. It says \"Leader Rare: Life, Courage, Leadership, Survival, Heroism, Devotion, Character.\" I'd like to live by that character. To throw that character out the window, so I'm going to need a drink for this one. Colin, what before we start? What would be the five or four words that just describe you? Heroism definitely would heroism be in there? Would do those all apply? Let me read those again. Let's go on the table here: Courage, yeah; oh, yeah; Leadership, sure; Survival, oh, yeah; why is survival that one that stands out to you? That's when you want to survive, you drink whiskey, whiskey because that's the one thing you need out in the wild to survive. All right, sorry Colin, no it's okay. What is your topic?

Here's my thing on that one though - don't you feel like that's a little bit of a relief though because now they can go forward with Lawrence Kasdan as a writer and write something good; they don't have to adhere to the metacanon. Well, I guess they actually still do - Lucas wrote that and that is canon, and so is Jar Jar Binks. Yes, Jar Jar Binks is canon. Prince Shaak Ti is not canon, Dantooine is not canon, Mara Jade is not canon, Grand Admiral Thrawn is not canon. Jar Jar Binks and those racist Asian Trade Federation people are canon.

They said that everything that is not from Clone Wars or one other show, Rebels, or the six movies are not canon anymore; they're not canon too bad. So like, so for people who don't know, Shadows of the Empire was released in '96 or '97, and it's the story between Empire and Jedi, and it's awesome, really, really good. It introduces a bunch of new characters and explains things like how Leia becomes a bounty hunter in Jabba's Palace and stuff like that.

A Lucasfilm story group moving forward will ensure that all new comics, books, games, and other media are considered Canon and valid to the story being told in the films. So I think there were people who worked at Lucasfilm whose whole job was to keep the expanded universe not even conflicting with itself and then the movies. So they would if it wasn't considered Canon, they wouldn't have given a **** about what's the big uh... They have some sort of big anthology something library, some big thing they keep the records in - what that thing is called? It's a holocron. The holocron. Yeah, isn't that a cool thing?

Not all of them, I'm sure a lot of Star Wars fans are happy about that too, but I think older Star Wars fans who really were into the lore of the series before the special editions came out - so in the early to mid-90s, before they started altering things out of the actual movies. Right? Exactly, \"Gito\" shoots first. See, I don't understand though: like with with the old expanded universe, how could that have been canon when there was so much of it? Like the video games - all like not all made sense on top of each other. Yeah, more I mean like Dark Forces does you know like \"Cotour\" would make sense, like like the good ones, the good games: X-Wing versus TIE Fighter. I get it; I mean like like the game Dark Forces has like a real story, you know? Like those kinds of games - they did make sense. Obviously, there were like weird ass games.",
