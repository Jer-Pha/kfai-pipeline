Now that might sound like a silly topic and it is, but I'm talking just about your memories - your memories with cell phones and how important they were to you guys. I don't know where you guys were at in your life when you first got a cell phone. In college? You in college? I was in my junior year of college when I got a cell phone, or sophomore year I started driving, and my mom... it wasn't a cell phone, it was a car phone. Oh, the car phones are the best! It was just a long receiver that had a power plug, and it was literally put in the glove box in case the car broke down or I needed to call it. And I remember I had my cell phone number, which is my cell phone number for the rest of my life - not until I changed it to a California number, but it was written in Sharpie on the back of it because like, what the hell am I going to remember this dumb number that I'll never use? And I don't even know what a car phone is. The car phone would be in the",

That was middle school, and like while you'd be aiming people, you'd be like talking about what's a cell phone? Do you have one and stuff like that. It's just crazy where, like I remember my first cell phone. It was not the flip phones; it was like just a...I don't even know how you say it. It wasn't a new Kia, but it was like that.

I think it's creepy but someone did a video of Google Glass on the internet about 6 months ago of them playing hockey with it on - very cool, you know, like first person perspective, but I'll wear that for hockey. No, but the first person perspective, like the video, like the cinematography that you can do with it is so cool, like I played hockey for a long time, it's like being on the ice, watching that guy play in HD was awesome, so like that kind of stuff's cool. But I'm always creeped out when I see these dudes wearing Google Glass and a lot of bars and restaurants will not let you wear Google Glass inside - and I don't blame them, it's weird. Why? Yeah, well, it's like upskirts, right, like I mean somebody's going to use it to be creepy, so yeah, I can totally understand why you wouldn't wear it, harder to put your head up a skirt, I guess, yeah, I...haven't wrapped my head",

We were having one at the Antler House, my sophomore year, and all of a sudden like it just started vacating and it was all the new kids, and I was like, \"Where are you all going?\" And they're like, \"We're going over Devon's house to play Halo.\" I'm like, \"You're a bunch of idiots; you've just drunk my beer.\" Yeah, I was never interested in LAN parties. CU - I remember in college people even were connecting to Xboxes together and I was... I had an Xbox and I was like, \"You want to play Halo?\" They're like, \"Not a problem,\" and they're all right; can we borrow your Xbox?",
