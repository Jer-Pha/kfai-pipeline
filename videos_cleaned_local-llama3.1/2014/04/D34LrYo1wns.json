Someone was like, \"Why do they call him the Pride of Long Island?\" Oh my God! So I said, \"Cuz he likes to go on islands.\" Long Island is where you're from, the pride of Long Island. And then at the very end, rounding it out, the pure one Tim Gettys, our host. I'm a little upset right now. What's wrong? I forgot to put my shoes on, so now I feel naked. And you also forgot to get me a Mexican food. Did I? I'm just everything is wrong, but you remember to wear your sweet double jacket. Yes, it's really cold in here, and I like this jacket.

Just want to say something you know might be a little controversial before we get into the topics. I've been watching Breaking Bad, I'm in the third season. Uh, not as amazing as everyone makes it out to be. It's a good show, it's a good show but I'm not like... blown away like everyone talks about it like they talk about The Wire or Sopranos. Or it's not even remotely as good as I think it was better than The Wire. Here's the thing is everything builds on top of each other though by the you know what I mean? Like it's all one thing that like it gets faster and faster and I'm more in control don't spoil anything for me but because I don't I don't want to know what happens obviously I know how it ends, I saw the last scene.",

Basically, George R.R. Martin is known for building up characters so he can destroy them. It's really hard to watch that because you fall in love with these characters, and he loves just like... oh, you like this character? Boom, that just stabbed them through the groin.
