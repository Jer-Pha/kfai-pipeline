Have you seen The Lego Movie? I haven't seen it yet. So that is what sparked this. Okay, I did see it last week. How was it? Excellent! Excellent! I didn't think it was going to be bad; I thought it was going to be super. Okay, Lego movie or Frozen - Frozen's not even a question, but going to the Legos, get the word out, and you already we already knew what it was gonna be. It's like the biggest movie of all time now, it sucks. Let go! Let go! Thank you. I really like that one. Nick, um, but with The Lego Movie, I, I saw the trailers and I was like, oh this is cool. I'm happy they're not going with the whole CG look that all the the games do and stuff which is cool, but like I was like, oh man, they're doing the whole stop motion thing with actual Legos - dope! I'm in it then watching the trailer, it's like a a lot of the jokes aren't.",

I mean, like it was one of those things when they put out the debut things we were doing Ghostbusters, they had a firehouse in the background, and people thought it was part of the set, but it turned out it was just the guys in the car.

I there was so many instances where I ended up gluing my fingers together with super glue cuz I try to fix something, and it would just be... I was not very coordinated. It's still not very coordinated as a human being. So one thing that I've never figured out, and this is me and my friend constantly go back and forth on this, is the like the Marvel figures that come with an arm or a head or a leg of Apocalypse or one of the bigger characters.

Nick, real quick, before we move on, do you remember a G.I. Joe called Frag Viper? No, that sounds awesome. So Frag Viper was a grenade launcher like a grenade Viper and I before I show it to you, the reason I liked him is because we were talking about all the guns and all the **** and like power finel came he came with a backpack that you could put like two grenades on so like there were these two pegs and then he had like a wire that like it could go from his backpack to his mask so he can breathe.

I was just about to say, like the McFarlane toys are kind of what revolutionized that in the 90s, and man, that was just the game changer when Spider-Man came out with all parts and you can make them pose like the covers and stuff. Yeah, how come Spawn isn't big anymore? People got over him mid-90s; he was new, he was new, that's why he was hot. Yeah, okay... it's hell and it's this and it's this. He's the anti-hero, right?
