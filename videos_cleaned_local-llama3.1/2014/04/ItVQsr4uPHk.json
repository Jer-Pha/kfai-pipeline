What do you mean you're pimping out a product? You mean I'm wearing the new Oreo Gasm shirt, you can get at DistrictLines.com/GameOverGreggy. You are wearing that. You're also wearing a lot of grease from Portillo's. My birthday, ladies and gentlemen, is this Sunday if you're watching on YouTube; it's already come and gone. I'm a year older, and you didn't know. And so my dad from Chicago sent me Portillo's - it was the Italian beef package. Usually we get hot dogs. You've had them here before. The beef package worked out; it was legit, it was excellent as Portillo's always is. I think that the Portillo's mail-order beef is restaurant quality, whereas the hot dogs I think dip down a little bit. What is this going to accomplish? I brought... I am covered in gravy though from the beefs that I was making.",

I've got all over my new OreoGasm shirt that I can just go buy another one at a reasonable price at District Lines.com GameOverGGY along with a slew of other shirts, including Sean Finnigan's \"Like Hiking\" Game Over Greggy Ando Shadow Boxing Association established 1996 - there's the call for president shirt, another favorite, that's a staple. That's a classic; as I is, that's one of the founders of the Game Over Greggy District Line shop. That's not doing anything; it's working maybe so.

Yeah, so they only make contact with civilizations that have progressed to the point where they've achieved Warp drive and then go okay it's time for First Contact. So because of that one instance, the Borg went back and wanted to stop it, thus stopping us from ever achieving all the technology that would have come from that in the future.

It makes my classic reading with basically every movie that I've ever seen since. But yeah, he has that great line in that movie where he says he's like... Will Smith says why not just tell everyone and he goes, \"he's like people are smart.\" He goes no, a person's smart; people are stupid together. And it's true because people get together and mass hysteria ensues, and no one knows information. We all want information, so we then start just sort of picking at each other and buying into the fear right. And so I think that would have definitely happened, no doubt.

I feel like that's really interesting if that happens, because I think it flies in the face of Colin's theory of religion breaking down over it, cuz like correct me if I'm wrong, like your thought here is that the you know Bible says like God created us in His image so when aliens show up that are totally not in our image that would be like for most people like \"I guess this was wrong\" and then the way I was describing it to Christine right would be that there'd be this breakdown of people who've been on the fence or have like",
