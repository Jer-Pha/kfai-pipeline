Like sometimes I just I'll go on these weird kicks where all I do is eat protein and like think I'm losing weight but in reality I'm probably not. You are, you look good. Sometimes I break and when I break I break hard and I go directly to one place. There's one fast food establishment that I that I love more than anything in this planet and that is Taco Bell, the T-Bell. Yep, and what I like about Taco Bell is that they only have really like three ingredients but the menu is vast. Yeah, I mean they just can make billions of different menu items with those combinations of those three elements. So I I this is the question I have for you guys today if you could only live on one fast food and I live on it like you wouldn't gain weight you wouldn't die you wouldn't get anything but you can only have one fast food for the rest of your life what would it be and I'm",

You know, like In-N-Out, it's better quality food. I mean, I'm not arguing that there's something to be said about cost, just about the price range of how much a meal is and like the combo variety. I feel like Portillo's is of a higher standard; I agree with that 100%. And I think that that makes it a little less fast, but In-N-Out is of a higher standard too. Should we call P-County? Yeah, it's cheap, but it's good, it's good quality food; so price seems arbitrary. It seems to be... I think price has a lot to do with it. I don't know; let's let Greg go call Portillo's right now and see if they count themselves amongst the fast food chains. Okay, but yeah, you know.",

We are not fast food, we are good food quickly. Linda, wow! I mean like I'm just saying because it'd be a funny story for us, not cuz I want Linda to get fired again.

P has it, but there's one thing even better than the pump: what's better is what Chick-fil-A has, which are these little \"hindes\" packets that are like you know when you get barbecue sauce; you rip them like and you rip it open, it's like that - it has a little p-tab you rip it open and you can just dip it in ketchup.
