They call the Ghostbusters 'cause they're in control. Was it Hammer who did that one? That was uh Bobby Brown. Well, I guess we're going to have to take control. Got got take uh. I thought you were going to go that or I thought you might go John Williams' Superman; that was a great score as well. That was a great yeah score. That's probably in my book not my favorite but the most iconic score ever ever made, I think Star Wars. Do you think Star Wars is Star Wars though? That's yours, Superman's close, no, I'm saying Star Wars is the most iconic. I think Superman is still more iconic, no man, no son. Because Star Wars, Star Wars has that that one opening like you know, you know what I'm interested in though we've talked about this with episode seven now that Fox",

Sorry, Pok\u00e9mon, I was saying that okay. Let's continue. She's just a **** magician too. Frozen is a great soundtrack too; Frozen is amazing. Uh, actually, a lot of Disney soundtracks are amazing. Oh yeah, just because they're musicals. In fact, I still have to go super. This is why I think the Superman soundtrack is better than Star Wars, just because of the way it starts. You get that like it's the buildup, yeah, and then it's like what was that \"Superman\" theme you up? Cheetos all skunked, skunked, and it just goes into... and you hear it, and it just instantly makes you feel like you are flying. Yeah, that is why that movie and that soundtrack is so",

If I could make the music that I would really want to make it would be like, yeah, the mid 90s probably. I feel like the 80s would have been more fun though, I mean I would have kids or you would have ODed on something, I mean I I I love you know my girlfriend makes fun of me because I always think about I would love to be in a New Wave band and play Steinberger bass and like you know like you know those are the ones with like cut like that all the new wave guys played with like the C badass like fretless, yeah well not not fretless but like that you like tune them from the back, oh yeah yeah yeah those they're like super expensive and totally unnecessary but",

No, last I saw was literally when it was like Colonial... oh okay, I'm confusing it with the Kevin Costner movie \"Dances with Wolves,\" which was phenomenal as well. That was Civil War. Thanks, guys, great talk, like it really energized me. So, I mean, shout out to Jurassic Park and all those like that - they're so good. Mhm. But my sleeper hit is in Seattle, uh, Sucker Punch, which, regardless of the quality, regardless of the quality of the movie, the soundtrack is amazing. It's something that I always make sure to keep on my iPod; it's so good, and they just... it's so what tracks do you got? So, it's all remakes - they're all like ridiculously overproduced covers of things, but overproduced with like orchestra stuff, so like it.",
