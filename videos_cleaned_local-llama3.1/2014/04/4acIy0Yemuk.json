Okay, back when they were hip and cool, and even you know just movie theaters would have these little arcades; they still do, sure. There's a lot of places you go and there's arcade games, and I feel like there's a special place in my heart because going there with your friends and playing video games are awesome. There's something special about arcade games, though. Sure, they were rip-offs, and they were never as much fun as your video games at home because they cost money and they were a rip-off. Well, I feel like earlier on in the 90s, sure, they were ahead, and it's like back then what I always find interesting is how much we enjoyed peripherals when we didn't have them; yep, yep. Now we all hate them, and everything, but back then it was like, \"Oh my God, I can play it with a guitar\"",

You don't have that kind of thought process. No, no, of course not. Of course, yeah, I think so. Street Fighter is definitely a seminal arcade game for me too, and I **** loved that game. There was a place called Time Out near my house on Long Island, named after the Zack Morris move, exactly. I used to go there in the late 80s with my brother; um, and my brother's a big gamer back in the day. What I really loved about it is the reason arcades died by the way was because the NES era was the first era where there could be arcade parody.

And the other was The Real Ghostbusters arcade game which I also remember being awesome but I can't speak with any confidence if it was 'cause it was dumb.
