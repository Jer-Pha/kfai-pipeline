How much cocaine you do today? I don't do cocaine, but what I do do is shadowbox. The Kickstarter has begun! I started, I was thinking about taking up shadowboxing again, Greg. You started, you've launched a new t-shirt campaign for shadowboxing. I have launched a new t-shirt for that, and because I actually did, I did the design for it, and in doing the design for it. You did not get back into shadowboxing. I started designing it with both hands, and then midway through the design, by the way that design, countless hours went into that. Arguably like three or four weeks of my time. As I was designing, one of my hands just started, you know, just to kind of get back into the motion of it. That's like swimming, that's how shadowboxing works. It's how you warm up your rotation. You gotta loosen it up. You gotta loosen it",

You get a little bit of this, and then all of a sudden I heard a noise, and I immediately snapped back to my Kato 1 position from, no I don't, none of this actually happened. When you look down, it's actually a whole new design. It just felt right. And I was like, whoa. And next to the computer was his dead wife. He's a lethal weapon, ladies and gentlemen. You can't sneak up on him. That's not how it works, D. Roger, that's a special forces tattoo. Lethal Weapon 1. Okay, great. Then we got the pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. Oh yeah, you're popping. You're showing your pop filters. Guys, we're gonna get pop filters. There are one kid talking about pop filters. There's a lot of kids that talk about it.

I gave up on life a long time ago and got married, but... I don't know what that meant. He got married when I was in his wedding. I actually married him. I know that. It means that marriage ends your life. But why did he drop the ending about the show? Because he just, it's on his mind. Okay. Yeah, he watches our show. Actually, he has a lovely wife, and I'm super happy for you guys. Expecting your first kid. Good job. Hopefully that was public knowledge. If not, it is now.

Well, it's alright. We can refer to your GameOverGreggy.com exclusive scoop. Oh, man. So, no, he watched the show, but I trust him implicitly when it comes to audio, and he said, do me a favor and get pop filters. So, the first step, I think, in this journey is to Google \"pop filter.\" Sure. Figure out what that means. Sure. Figure out what that might look like. And then buy them. We did. We had the ones that kind of little discs that sit over, but they were jangly made, so we need to get professional ones. I watch Austin City Limits, by the way, every so often, and last time I watched it, I'm real proud of Chris O'Keefe, and I shook my girlfriend and wasn't paying attention.

I think he's actually one of the engineers. Oh, okay. He's one of the guys that goes back and... He knows a lot of things. Yeah, he's a very impressive human. Can you introduce me to some of the Nashville people, you think? From the TV show Nashville. I don't think Nashville and Austin are anywhere near each other. But I'm talking about the artists on the TV show Nashville. Maybe they've played Austin City Limits. Maybe they've been to Austin.

On Friday, we post the MP3 at gameovergreggy.bandcamp.com for $1. And if you say, fuck that, we won't pay. We put them up for free the following week on YouTube, broken out topic by topic.

So thanks, Tennessee. Big ups. I like Tennessee, I've been there. Memphis is an interesting place. That's it. That's all I have to say about it. Good music there. Yeah, really good music. Saw 311 there. So it was excellent. Where haven't you seen 311? I've seen 311 21 times. No way. God. Really? We're talking about Austin City Limits, which is coming up. That's mind boggling.

Here's the problem, and I've talked about this before, but here's my problem with this fashion thing. Like I said in that one, I grew up my ass hanging out, my ass cracked at any time, but that's not a good look for anybody.

They had to sell a lot of merchandise off the shelves because the nylon they were using was way too thin so when women would do the actual thing the pants were meant for which was yoga you it would be like it would go so sheer. And I've seen this in person and I to this day do not understand why they discontinued those pants. I just like that they were on the market for so long before anyone noticed this phenomenon because most people buy the Lululemon pants and just wear them to go to Starbucks. That's true.
