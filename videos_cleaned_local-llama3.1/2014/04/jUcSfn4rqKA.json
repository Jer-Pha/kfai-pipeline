Jimmy Champagne, in New York, you got a Spider-Man so Spiderman I'm going to send all my things over here for you to see that ** movie, see Thomas H's greatest work. Mr. Champagne uh invited me to do his podcast and we've been gone back and forth because I think I messed up the audio record on my on my side so he's got like hours and hours and hours of just dead silence no it's like some for some reason the tempo's going up and down up and down so he's got to like fix that as he goes oh wow what a nightmare it's a nightmare it's almost not worth it almost but now you got a shout out another game great show what up Champagne uh my topic tonight would be helpful to shout off that their name of the podcast you're going to be on, it's the Jimmy and Eden podcast. There you go, it's really good, it's on NBC Bing, it's not on NBC Google it.",

Bing it, not Google. It... um... Go so I I wonder this sometimes because when I was a kid, I really really really someone asked me a topic: what do you want to be when you were a kid? We'll get into that later. My answer is Batman. I wanted to be Batman; that was the first thing I could remember thinking about being as I got older, though, it strikes me that it might be a little weird and or terrifying if Batman were real. Absolutely, that would not be cool. So that's what I want to talk about: what if Batman were real? What if there was a man who was like 6'4\" and I'm I'm assuming we're living in a universe where there's no other so it's real life right now, and all of a sudden there's a Batman fighting crime. So my question is: is there a comic book Batman in this universe? Are there comic books in this universe? It's this",

There was a Hey Arnold episode about this, with Monkey Man, and it didn't end well for Monkey Man. So at any point do we think this is a cool thing or is it just terrifying? I think it's the same thing that happens in every Batman film, right where it would be we wouldn't believe people for the longest time then it would be like you're being a coward about it. Why would he jump on somebody smoking a cigarette in the Tenderloin? He's looking for bad guys.

There's no footage of it, it's just your word versus his and it's the other thing is like Batman, you know he won't kill people but he **** them up, he jack up like if you just beat the **** out of someone leaving in front of a police department that's scary as **** yeah, that's messed up. It's messed up. I have a big question that we haven't touched on because we're talking about he's going to the Tenderloin which is a terrible part of San Francisco by the way in case you're curious why we're talking about it and he goes and he **** up people that are robbing cars or whatever they're doing right but do the super villains exist?

No, I mean just the minutia of like trying to tell real stories opposed to the pulpy comic books from the pre-war era. Like, and so when did they start getting into the real lore, with huge threads and arcs that matter? It depends how you look at it. To me, and I could be totally wrong about this, but for Spider-Man, the death of Gwen Stacy is like one of the first big moments in comics, where it's a serious thing and there are stories that mean something and you're going somewhere, and it's not all just stupid fun right?

But I don't remember Comics being significant, like if I grew up more today, like as a millennial, I assume that Comics would be a bigger part of my life because they were just a bigger part of cultural mainstream. And so I guess what I'm saying is like were Comics always kind of the same big and I think the collection of people on the internet and all that kind of stuff made it bigger or just that we were more aware of this sub this you know this subculture existing or did Comics just kind of come back because I'm telling you like it wasn't weird to me and my friends that we weren't in the comics, I didn't know anyone that was in no, I was I",

And The Death of Superman, and making deaths matter even though they never really stick but coming back and doing different things like you see people in the same way. Like I always talk about video games right where like I understand senators freaking out about it because they remember video games being their 8-year-old playing Mario, and then they stop playing games, and now they hear they can kill a hooker in a game; they think of Mario and their 8-year-old playing it.

It was awesome, really slick and big. It had that cool cover to it, that paper. See another thing is the OPM with its demo disc. That was such a game changer.
