I think I did invite you, and you're like \"Oh, s**t.\" My way, I did nothing that day. Hey Tim, about um so I'm gonna talk about something that's timely. So you can just give me a minute or two to catch you up on what's happened here, and we can talk about it. Want to talk about Brendan Eich, who is the co-founder of Mozilla and CEO. He came under fire this week for donating to a campaign to ban gay marriage in California. He has resigned. Eich, who became the CEO of the nonprofit company behind Mozilla Firefox on March 24th, had donated $1,000 for the successful Prop 8 ballot measure that passed in the November 2008 state election. Last year, California's ban on gay marriage was a big issue.",
