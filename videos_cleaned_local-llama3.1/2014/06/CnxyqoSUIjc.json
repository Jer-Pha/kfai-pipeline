I like that one. It had a Youngstown song. Who's Youngstown? They were a boy band. Okay, oh I remember them - the three of them. Yeah, yeah, I like boy bands. So you're you are inconclusive on ghosts - yes, that's why that was my topic - I wanted to see what y'all thought. I see, I think they're real - yeah, yeah. Do you believe in heaven and afterlife and all that? I don't believe in heaven and the afterlife.

I think an M1 Garand, which is probably my grandpa's from World War II, and I think we found a 19th-century single-shot rifle too, which was cool. Single-shot rifle. I think I think there is a there's a difference between eeriness, yeah, which maybe is a product of ghosts and ghost stories and then actual ghosts that exist. What what is a ghost? That's what I was going to say too. Are we talking about just like spiritual energy stuff, like you're talking about Nick, or is it an apparition? Yeah, I think I think what I'm talking about is more of like the energy that comes from a human being's body after they die.

You can't come back as a rock because rocks aren't alive; you come back to something else that's living, right? So that's why you're not going to be a rock.

It's like one time they turned on the exhaust fan right, and all this like junk fell out of it or whatever - that was enough for them. That was enough for them to believe that that was the sign... and blah blah blah.
