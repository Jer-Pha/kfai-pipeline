We've talked about this in the past; I just couldn't, by the time I got to high school, I just couldn't do the math - I could barely do pre-cal at all. So like my dream of being like a physicist or even a chemist or something like that... even though chemistry's a little more straightforward, it was dead for me; I couldn't do it, even though I'm really fascinated by it. So like if I could do anything, I would probably try to be one of those scientists - like an astrophysicist or something like that.

I can't prove why Stephen Hawking says certain things; I just read what he says makes any sense.
