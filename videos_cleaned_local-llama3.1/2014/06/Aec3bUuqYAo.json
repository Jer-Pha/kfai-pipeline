You understand that we're more than just one thing, so if you're soccer, that's great. What's driving me crazy about the World Cup is all these people who have never ever ever spoken about soccer before suddenly tweeting their goddamn face off about soccer. Shut up; I know you don't care about sports. Shut the **** up and so just back up about like you don't need to be talking about soccer this much. I don't understand why this is the global fascination, you're suddenly like well I'll tweet about it now and act like I'm in on it like you care about it and this all goes back to the whole like the thing",

I'm doing the same thing, this is another reason I'm so mad about the World Cup is the fact that they're making me be the people I hate during the Super Bowl. We are nerds, we get that, we have nerd friends, but Colin and I enjoy football, so on Super Bowl Sunday we tweet about the Super Bowl. People are like \"sports ball\" for some reason whenever sports are on and people care - the people who don't care about sports and are video game nerds like us suddenly have to regress and suddenly forget what a touchdown is or how to get into a stadium, they're like \"woah, football, how do they get in the seats?\" I don't know, I've never been, I don't like sports.

But this is the problem: is that I'm not mad about you tweeting about soccer, sports fans, I get it, I totally am fine with that, I want you to enjoy your shows and go watch it. I'm mad at all these fair-weather fans flooding my feed and then making it so I can't tell them to shut the **** up because if I do that, if I say that, I then become a hypocrite for the Super Bowl Sunday tweets I hate. But mind you, this World Cup goes on till July 13th, shoot me in the **** face Tim, I don't want to see this anymore and so it keeps going this way and here's the other rub to it, the other layer KCK to this **** world: are we in the main event now?

I do agree that the things that bother me most about the Twitter feed are not necessarily the people that are tweeting about football or soccer rather um because the people that do tweet about soccer my I don't follow many people like um our friend James Stevenson and Insomniac, he is a soccer fan. 12% of my list you know uh Jeff Rubenstein, he is a soccer fan so like those are the only guys I'm really seeing tweet about it.

So if I start tweeting tomorrow about it, first off, I'd just be excited you were tweeting because it's so RT all the time; I just respond to people's tweets. Follow me on Twitter, but the two things the two things that Greg said that I think resonate the most is Americans are going to call football what you call football in Europe and South America and everyone else in World Soccer - that's what we're going to call it, we're going to call it that forever, so just let it go. Number like...and I'm...and I know that's probably deeply offensive to some of you; we have football here, and that's going to be our sport.

I don't understand because the ball isn't an egg; I don't even think that makes any sense. Just call it the other thing.\n\nThat bothers me again, what Greg was saying, and it really does bother me is like open your mind up a little bit if someone's tweeting about something that you don't necessarily like, they're not tweeting in excess or whatever, and open your mind up. Like I hate when people say \"I follow you for games\" or whatever; I follow because I'm interested in what you have to say, and I hope that you enjoy the fact that I have a broad range of things that I want to say. I certainly enjoy it when people that I follow tweet about different things; it makes it not monochrome, you know what I mean?",

Here's the other thing, here's the other thing for all the ignorant people that are tweeting about these guys and nice suits or whatever - you're not allowed to wear suits on the sideline of NFL games anymore. Or they would remember that there was a coach who was Mike Nolan, I think his name was, of the 49ers. He wanted to wear a suit like an old-school suit and a hat, and Reebok had to make the suit because they have a deal where the coaches have to wear their paraphernalia. Yeah, so like the reason that people in American NFL coaches don't dress in suits anymore is because they're not allowed - they have to wear their team color and like the things that are branded with those names or whatever.
