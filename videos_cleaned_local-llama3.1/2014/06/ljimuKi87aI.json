And it doesn't happen because the anonymous nature of the internet gives people a brazen nature that doesn't translate when you even confront them online, you know. I talked to some guy today who said something snarky about me and it wasn't the worst thing in the world but I know this guy has said stuff about me in the past where people have brought him up to me before and they like to talk about you in circles whatever. And I confronted him about it and I was like, \"Have some balls and say it to me like you're a man and stop being so passive-aggressive and just say what you need to say,\" you know.

So I'm kind of curious how you guys feel about this internet culture that drowns out the positivity and kind of brings you down with the negativity. Because you know, you can't even have to actually search for the things that people are saying about you because they don't even have the courage to say it to your face or at a Comic-Con or something in your face. They'll treat you nicely and be friends with you but never say things to your face. I'm kind of curious how you guys feel about that.

So that's what I always come back to right? There's the vocal minority who hates what you do, but especially like when we talk about IGN, right? Like there you look at an article and there's 12 negative comments out of 300 comments, and you go in the backend - out of whatever 50,000 to 100,000 views - and it's like you are statistically insignificant.
