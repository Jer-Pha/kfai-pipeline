So I think it was last week we uh somebody mentioned I think it was Colin, it sounds like a Colin thing to say, he mentioned the word damp and it upset me, it upset me dearly. Was it damp? It was damp, yeah. A lot of people were tweeting me, 'I guess one of the quotes which was \"damn girl, you're damp,\"' yeah, yeah. I don't know who said that though. I say someone said it turns out in England, that's actually does mean that, that they say that hey, that girl's a bit damp for you or that girl's dancing really, they say some weird stuff in England, don't they? Yeah, I don't know about that. They can grab their beers and go do whatever they want, they've got to go to the Lou, yeah. It's just my dad's name, oh wait, is Cheryl in the bathroom maybe she was probably thinking a shower so you, she goes in, yeah, girl, my girlfriend's in the bathroom, go in, she's fine, she's fine with it, she's taking a bath, Christine loves them baths.

Growing up in Riverside, I used to do that just for fun because it would be so hot. You'd be outside anyway and be like, \"I'm not going to go inside waste air conditioning.\" Because you open the door, yeah? You just go outside. That's a good idea; it's very liberating. Should have done that. There was one time when I was 12; I was sleepy, and I woke up, and I had to pee, and I had some garbage to throw away. I went to the bathroom, threw the garbage in the toilet, went to the garbage, and just started peeing into it. I'm like, \"Oh my God.\" I realized halfway through I started peeing into the garbage. Yeah, that's really weird. It was really... your parents should have given you back to the people that you stole from; should have given you back to me when you were a little kid. Mhm.

There's not there's not a good word for poop, but \"scat\" is a good word for that. Like when we're talking about these things, is that a thing? I got to go scat; I'm going to go scat into the toilet wall. I think that's actually a type of music, vocal jazz, oh well, that too. It's also now it's a type of vile porn.

If you follow me on Twitter, if you don't, it's @Nick_Scarpino, but let me know if Deep Space 9 is better than Voyager or vice versa because I'm going to probably watch DS9 next, but that might take me 45 years because there's so many episodes of Voyager, so it's a big time commitment.
