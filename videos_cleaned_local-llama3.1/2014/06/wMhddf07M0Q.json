Is a big deal. Blood and Marijuana stars in the face. Uh, so the topic is this. So um, so it's real simple: we're all American, we're all natural-born citizens of this country, and I'm your boy Colin Moriarty, a Paleo-Republican old-school conservative, you know. Oh, this is cute - loves America very much. So it's not... it's not about that. It's just like, I really think America is the best country in the world; most economically vibrant, we're the freest, all those kinds of things great. But if one day the government became say tyrannical and they were like, \"You can no longer live in this country because you're not X, Y, and Z or whatever,\" and you had to go, and they took your passport, and they were like, \"We'll send you to one place, and they'll take you\"",

You got a downside to get French uh oh, so yeah. So the downside to Canada was just um I don't think it's as economically vibrant and I think for what you spend you don't get what you pay for there. Okay, you pay a lot and you don't get everything you should get for what you spend like San Francisco. Like San Francisco. Number one Stockholm, Sweden. You know, you pay a lot but you get everything you could literally get - like five master's degrees there on the government. 100% Universal Health Care. 100% Universal Health Care. 100% universal uh education to the extent to which you want to be educated all on the government.

When I went there, I was looking forward to being the only black person in Sweden, and like having everybody touch my hair and give me money, and uh they were black people everywhere, which was kind of... did they touch your hair, give you money? No, they're like another black person. Um, but uh, like, but like the culture there's really like it's incredibly intellectual, it's really vibrant, they're really focused on like scholarship and history.

It's not just that it's an Eastern alphabet, but there are three plus Japanese alphabets right there. There's a modern one, there's a traditional one, there's an ancient one, then there's a fourth that incorporates like Western concepts into kanji. Right? And even in Japan, these people don't know all the **** kanji for their own language; they were raised there and they don't know it, and they don't understand it. And then beyond that, like even if you understand the literal translation of kanji, the ideas are so foreign. So they're expressing concepts that, like, even translated into English, were like, \"Wait, what?\" Yeah, yeah, that's really cool. I've always wondered how you type things and that's...

So for example when you walk into a store here in the United States you walk around touch everything until you want something and then you engage with the staff, over there walking through a shop was like walking into someone's home and the first thing you have to do is acknowledge the staff and say hello it's like coming into someone's",

Like you know, it's like raging against the machine used to sing it back, wreck America, and you know, we hold people to certain standards. Like when people here learn English, yeah, like you're in America, speak English, and I frankly completely agree with that. You know, like you're in my country if you're gonna work at a store and you can't speak to me, you don't belong working at that store. I'm totally fine with that, you know what I mean?
