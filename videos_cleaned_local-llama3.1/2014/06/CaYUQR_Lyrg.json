That's the way I felt about Clinton, like you could see even after Lewinsky; like he was still popular. Gore didn't really suffer because of him, so he probably would have been president at least for one more term, you know? So there are all those like weird things, like if these like FDR died right after he was elected the fourth time and that gave us Truman, and all these kinds of things which you know changed you.

We each bring a random topic of conversation for your amusement. If you like that, you can get the whole show in MP3 every Friday at GameOverGreggy.bandcamp.com for $1. If we're not worth that dollar, go to YouTube.com/gameovergreggy the next week. Every day it's broken out topic by topic until the whole show posts on Friday is one big episode.
