I don't argue just like an idea, I don't argue that, but I also don't think there's not nuance in how those kinds of situations go down about who's on whose side - the military might not want to engage in warfare against its own people, like all those kinds of questions. In fact, I'm pretty positive that the military - people often think if there was a rebellion right, or just like a state tried to secede or whatever, in the military world, I'm not so sure the military would roll in there; you know, I'm not so sure they would want to do that.
