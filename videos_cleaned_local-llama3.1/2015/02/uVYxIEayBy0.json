So, that's why I got Portillo here. I got you here. And I got a little Criminal Girls: Invite Only. Criminal Girls: Invite Only. Possibly the most uh outrageous game on PlayStation Vita. Definitely the most outrageous one to come out. We got invited. Yeah. We're using our PlayStation TV, of course, to stream this guy out to your to I guess make a let's play of it. I'd been doing a bunch of streams on Twitch. Yeah, you and Nick were doing them. Yeah, we were. And so we had started it and we were like, \"Oh, you know, Colin Moriarty had been talking all this trash trash on IGN's Beyond about how, you know, this game is whoa crazy and everything else.\" Then you play it, you jump in, you're like, \"Well, it's just an RPG with some anime girls here, right? So like obviously we got to fight fight fight these two guys, right?\" Now whereas some anime or some",

This is just basically picking who you want to fight with, right? And like obviously there's different things. So down here, she's got the magic attack, she can do some damage to Mermaid or whatever. Oh yeah, mermaid. But there's less choice than, you know, it's not like Persona 4 where I jump in and I have to decide, oh man, who does this, who does that? I know the attack times two mean they're going to get attacked. You can see people are lighting up, right? So like if I'm attacking times two with her, I'll attack with her as well. Same thing there. Come down here, I get her. So you want to start going like This reminds me of Final Fantasy XIII battle system. Okay. Kind of. Okay. Just in the sense that like you just kind of choose",

This is this is what hell looks like, right? We're a man a man in hell. Uh we're here to help these to motivate these girls to go work off their sentences. They weren't bad people yet, right? But they were going to be bad people. Oh, so I walk around the Pure One. Exactly. We walk around, we fight everything, we have a great time, we earn these points, and then, as you just saw, the battle system, okay, was fine. It didn't look pervy. And this game is supposed to be all pervy like, well, what happens? Then you get here, this is where you motivate. This is It's starting to get weird. Exactly. This is This is the infirmary. This is where you come in and like you hit rest, right? It looks like a sex bed. I agree. Uh, so we've rested them. Now they're at full health, but now we need to motivate them, right? How do you",

So we kind Before you even get in there, how would you motivate them in real life? Yeah. I would ask them, \"You're in hell. Don't you want to leave hell?\" It seems like you could leave hell if you just did what you're supposed to do here. I feel like a little cheerleading would help. Sure, you could do that way, too. So here you jump in like you can see like what they have right now, right? So in terms of what I've unlocked for each character in their whole maintenance or edge play, these keep filling in and I get to do it. But the thing is like you you jump and you motivate them. Is edge play like foreplay? No. Here I mean like the whole thing we'll start with edge play. All right. Just to show you. All right. So like first off",

So like first off you see she doesn't want I'm using electricity on her here to motivate her. But I'm doing that by taking away keeping the temptations away from her. So you jump in here like I'm liking these fingers. These steamy things are happening here. And like at first you might be like, I don't even know what's happening, right? But like you start smacking it away. All right, we got some killer electric cockroaches. You see start you start like there's stuff going on back there. She's dressed as a cat. Maybe a fox. Very good. See something's happening. Drag the switch. So now this is this is level one. You can see that there's a woman there and she's scantily clad in some ways. I tell you, you know that. You already know that. Every time you go to talk to her, she's like, \"You're going to make me wear this.\"",

So anyways that's that's still I'm still at level one on the edge play right but I'm level four on maintenance. So this is this is a different scene what happens when you peel back some of the steam and you get to go in here and fight off the fight off the temptations for motivation time. We're in a motivator. This one we're just using whips and you can see there's less steam here. This is pornography, Greg. This is pornography. Yes, those are um cartoon boobs.

I didn't know that until you told me. Not that that makes that a valid excuse at all. Um, but she's a cartoon, so I shouldn't be attracted to her anyways. Well, it's like every other anime where it's just like they don't really go into how old everybody is or whatever. It's really weird with anime cuz why do they why are they always bending over? Like obviously she's adventuring somewhere. Like she's actually doing something sexual. She was like if she was in anime like fighting a big robot, she'd get in the robot and be in the same position.
