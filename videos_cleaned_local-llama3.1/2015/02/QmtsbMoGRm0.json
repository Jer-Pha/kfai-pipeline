January, now I guess this is feed it's all confusing because we're making up but of course I'm Greg Miller, you might know me from the internet, and we decided when we started Kinda Funny Games, of course, that we want to play games with you, interpret games with you, be there in the trenches with you, and that's why we started the Kinda Funny video game book club. It involves no books, but every month we choose a new video game to play together then get together and talk about it. That's why over here you got the Twitch chat going where everybody's talking about the same thing maybe you played this Super Metroid and then down here you got Ryan and you got Luis hello Ryan how are you good how are you I'm good Ryan tell, tell us about yourself who are you where are you from uh I'm from Lynchburg Virginia I'm a computer science major at Lynchburg College you cut class to come to this today right I",

Your episode was episode 60, I believe, and it just posted not too long ago. Yeah, it was episode 60, and it was quite the experience. So now what we're going to use you for is strictly b-roll when we want to talk about Super Metroid be like \"oh remember Super Metroid\" that's the box art there it is. That's all we have to do.

They had that's the technology they had, and it worked in the time obviously. It was critically acclaimed like this game, whether or not I agree with whether it stood up which I think it does. Um, those few little points don't detract from the experience as a whole in my opinion.

I feel like this game was uh I mean granted I I complete the game I got the 100% And but of course I had to use the the walkthrough and in my book I don't knock a game for uh for having to be a walk-through heavy game and I don't hold myself back for having to use a walkthrough and I still struggle. I felt like the the struggle was real and it was it was a game that was worth playing and I just uh I don't uh I mean yes there's some technical flaws in it and I just think that for me as a super as being my first uh console I I still love and appreciate it but that could be just uh my uh my old school ways kind of uh clouding my judgment there but I'd still say 85 okay Riley what are your final thoughts you don't have to give it a score we don't usually score",

Kelly's \"Bumpin' Grind\"; oh, we go my mind's telling me no it's '94 got the B-roll right here; '94; oh yeah, we pulled it up - don't worry now everybody remembers R.
