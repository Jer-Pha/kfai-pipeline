So here's the question then Tim, mhm, how we're deciding who the champion? Jesus, K, the champion of this so we're going to do this four-player match, then the loser steps out, it'll be a three-player match, and then it'll be a one-on-one for the day-to-day Champion. Why you talking like you're on like the day-to-day Championship now what? You have to notice about why am I Frozen? Oh God, Nick.

Also, it's totally a rip-off, and I'm sure Colin will agree with me here; this is the part of the Raa stage, yes, from PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale. Exactly, I know that they took inspiration, and how could you not take inspiration from Super Smash Brothers? There's one thing when I looked at when I played PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, the one thing I said, \"Smash Brothers\" - Oh Lord, damn it; the king of Smash Brothers, Tim Gettys is down, things are not looking good for Mother still.
