I'm Greg Miller, and this is my roommate Colin Moriarty. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So thanks for your support on Patreon.com/KindaFunny. We're doing a final season of me reaching to the random TAC-P pulling one out, tossing it at them lovingly, and then talking about it for your amusement if you like that. Like this video? Support us on Patreon. Subscribe to our channel. Share us with your friends. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is what is the best or worst advice you've ever gotten from an old school friend? Uh, I'm not sure what the worst advice I've ever gotten was because I'd really have to delve deep into my mind for that. But I can tell you what the best advice ever given to me was. Okay, uh... and I got it over and over again as I grew up: \"None of this matters right now because you're young.\"",

None of this matters right now because you're young and stupid, and you're not going to care about any of this in the future. That really was true, and however that was delivered to me as a kid, as a youth, as a teenager, even my early 20s - where they'd be like, \"You don't know what love is; it'll be all right.\" You know? Or, \"High school's dumb; you're just a kid. It won't matter.\" And well, they were almost every time that that was delivered to me from whoever that was delivered from absolutely right. Yeah, I agree with that. And so if you're young and dumb and watching this, that is 100% correct. But as someone who's young and dumb, I know how hard that is to accept. I remember when I fell in love in college, and I was like, \"I'm going to marry this girl.\" And everyone's like, \"You are too young to get married; you don't know.\" And I'm like, \"Ah, you don't know\"",

And then here I am divorced. Yeah, I mean it's true, man. Like, it is hard in the time to accept how dumb you are and how stupid you are. We're all dumb, and we're all stupid when we're that age. It's just... when I think about 16-year-old Colin or 18-year-old Colin, I just cringe. Oh God, you're so dumb; you know? Like, you thought you were smart, but you were really, really dumb. And uh, you might have been book smart or something like that, but like in terms of the things I was worried about, the things I was doing, and people maybe some of the people I was hanging out with or things I was really wrapped up about\u2014it was irrelevant; it was totally irrelevant. And uh, so I think that's a really sound piece of advice that you should listen to in the moment.",
