There's some things that must be out of order because what do we see in the bottom right corner? Yeah, that's my boy, huh? Oh yeah, oh now that Nick moves for a second there we go. Home there we go. Yeah, yeah, this is I think this is a scene from the lab, this is the end of Fast & Furious 6, yeah, yeah. So but then immediately we get in some trouble. Oh Mr. Jason Statham, you know if you see Jason Statham and trailer it's always bad news for someone, yeah. Whether it be the bad guy is a good guy in this case unfortunately it is the guy who plays the brother as everyone knows of the bad guy from Fast & Furious 6, yes. Now so what I was thinking about the flashback we're getting a little trickery here because the whole house exploring him getting the phone call obviously this is out of sequence because for anybody that saw Fast & Furious 6's credit sequence where we saw this and right behind him\"",

Yes, so there's no way I what we're seeing here right here yeah oh that's in Tokyo that's this is J.J. Abrams yeah I should we ask use me BAM boom all right so all of this with the team you saw not at the same time at the same time so now the house is decimated and their world is once again thrown into action mm-hmm and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson is involved unlockable the course now I'm a little upset because we saw a little bit of the funeral scene obviously Han's funeral R.I.P. here we got you know we got the team got a big part of the team here it's missing the white boy from Tokyo Drift, Luke Evans, it is missing the White Widow kerchief which we've seen and we know that he's being recruited we know he's in this movie he has some point right so I thought he was going to be more involved in the entire thing",

Oh, they do The Rock with a minigun, which you're like, that takes it up a notch. Mm-hmm. We've got more aerial stuff; they love planes falling out of cars falling out of the sky; they love this. Now I brought this to your attention earlier. Yeah, are they working with the army now? Of course, they are. Why not? Because you know what when you're better than the army, mhm, you're better than the CIA when you're better than any mercenary group out there, you work with whoever the hell you feel like. Exactly. Whoever Tyrese please do your thing. Tyrese, boom! Look at that. This is amazing. Then we got now go back; let's go back to that for a second. We've got yet another MMA fighter. Yeah, I'm balding. Ronda Rousey, Ronda Rousey. We had Gina Carano in laughs; it was awesome. The great fight with Letty already gets his character, and here we go again.",

They took a dip a notch of that first show this takes it up 30 notches yes because let's see, not only does he fly through the sky, a heater gets hit with a grenade and propels him further into another building. And you think it's over, your season is IRA oh that's a little auction with crazy go at you damn from, and then he jumps at that Honey movie, that's good. Now I'm not gonna take it a step further and be like responsibilities were done Carl and having completed killed in a crash no the fact that Vin Diesel can fly a Lambo through the air from one skyscraper to another skyscraper just makes me know I'm in the right time and place in life yeah exactly, I get to be excited for this film that I get to see it midnight showing with you somewhere.",

It's popular; it's gonna be amazing. Kim, what does this thing come out? Do you think it comes out April third? No, no, it's locally on Collins too much swing to make this happen next week probably. Brock thinks you can if anyone has the Rock's phone over Lily's tweet at Tim Gettys. Okay, you know what I phone ever don't actually go find we were making fun of Alex on me earlier, and saying how funny was more Vegas now we're all right; we were giving a **** well, I gotta say he is kind of correct about this. This doesn't make any sense but it does in context. We just saw before that the cars are falling out of the sky with Paul Walker. You know, know this is totally different. This is probably not.",

But then I guess that little bit more is the grenade propulsion, that's true. So look, I would go out of it and justin comically just fall right down the side of the building. Now, I will say as everyone out there knows, and we're big fans of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, and you know that's divisive amongst the people, but that movie is what set everything in motion to make this franchise something really special - that's the way it took it up. Now, what's upsetting me is not today, I'm happy; The Fast and the Furious 6 finally brought it back to Tokyo, and we're seeing the repercussions here, and all that right. I love that this one's called Furious, I love it, but it's weird that six wasn't called Furious 6 - it should have been because it would've been Fast Five in Furious 6; the title in the movie actually was for your six. Yeah, to go over this, you know what? Whatever it is, a revenge movie, I'll give it to him. I think at this point",
