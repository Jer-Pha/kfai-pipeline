Oh man, go first, taking it way back. Oh yeah, um, the first game that I have like vivid memories of playing was the original Super Mario Brothers on NES, 'cause I remember getting it for Christmas for me and my sister. It was a few years after it had come out, and my dad got it, and you know the game came with the console back then, you guys remember when games came with that topic? That was the topic last week, that was the thing. Um, and we played that game for hours and hours and hours, and poured over the strategy guide. I know you hate strategy guides, but back then you had to have them, the internet did not exist, um, I'm dating myself, but um, for me, um, that was like, that's why it has kind of planted the seed for a lifelong love",

Well, like all of that stuff, yeah exactly. Any you for either Dark or Goosebumps episode? But Greg, hey what about you? Oh, it all starts with Ghostbusters. I always tell this story: I was a young kid walking through Toys R Us to buy more real Ghostbusters figures with my mom, and we took a wrong turn down the video game aisle, and we were walking, walking, walking... And out of the corner of my eye in the old Toys R Us behind the glass against the wall, I caught the image of the Ghostbusters logo on a Sega Master System game. And I turned, and I was like, boom!

Cuz no, I because like I was a huge Nintendo fanboy when I was a kid. That's just all about it - NES, SNES, and then when the N64 came out, it was so devoid of games. Everyone forgets that the N64 had only two games for like two months: Super Mario 64, one of the best games ever made, and another game... I don't know if I want to go down that road. Are you about to say that Super Mario 64 is not good? No, no, I was going to say that Super Mario 64 is vastly overrated. Groundbreaking will be a topic next week. It's actually Super Mario Sunshine that was the better game. I want to repeat that - Super Mario Sunshine was said to be better. Cut out of the edits... Holy than Super Mario 64. Super Mario 64, like, okay, \"Okarina Time\" right? \"Okarina Time\" was a great game. Super Mario 64 is a great game. What were the better games? Majora's Mask and Sunshine. Oh wow, you think",

So well, first off before I even get to that, you were on the wrong track so much, I didn't even know there was a Sega Master System. Oh no, most people didn't. No, no. I bring kids over to play video games; I'm like, \"You want to play games today?\" Oh sure, they come, and I be like, \"What the heck is this?\" Do you not have a Nintendo? And I be like, \"No.\" Well, what's crazy about that is I didn't know I didn't know Master System was a thing until like a few years ago. Even like it's like it wasn't until you know video games on the internet; I was still into Master when I got the Genesis. My parents bought me the adapter so I could still play Master System games on the Genesis.",

Super Nintendo embarrassed it, but it was a good machine. Yeah, it was a good miss. So the first game like memory I have playing a game is Prince of Persia on some type of computer system. I don't remember what it was. Okay, um, and I remember just being like, \"Oh my God, you can interact with this,\" and it was crazy; it blew my mind. Then my dad, when I was in second grade, bought a Commodore 64. Keep in mind me being in second grade; this man, I was going to say you're young. Super Nintendo was out at that point, and uh, but I didn't know anything about all that.

What?\" And I saw it said 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and I'm like, \"Oh my God.\" And that was probably the moment that I was like, \"Video games in my life, this is the best thing you have to offer life.\" Then I didn't want to go to Great America; I was like, \"This sucks,\" but we went anyway. The entire time, I don't feel so well. I was thinking about Yoshi's Island, and man, Yoshi's Island\u2014one of my favorite games of all time.

My complete meltdown with Nintendo in 2008 was one of the funniest things ever, and my best was when Colin was trying to sell himself on Nintendo still being cool in 2008 when he would go home every night and play the Wii and not play other things like what did you play?
