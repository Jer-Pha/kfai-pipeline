You sort of... The episode starts off, spoilers, it's a two-part episode. We haven't seen the other part of tonight, well that's how serial television goes, it's very true, antiquated but um, it's a two-parter. We start off, we see Bob Odenkirk working in a cinnammon factory, yeah, and clearly this is his... It's done in black and white so and traditionally use black and white sort of kind of mirror flashback. This is actually a Flash Forward; we're seeing him at the end of his sort of where he's very very paranoid, he's a little bit of an alcoholic, and he's kind of looking over his shoulder everywhere he goes. This is this is the sequel to Breaking Bad; this is picking up after that Breaking Bad moment, and then we're flashing back years before when he was better known as Saul Goodman, and we get to see sort of where the character comes from and he's",
