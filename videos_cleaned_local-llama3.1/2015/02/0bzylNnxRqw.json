I've been around a little bit; uh, now, uh, I read a great quote many years ago that I think is true to some extent, and I'll explain why. And it's not meant to be a uh uh an admonishment or um sort of a a fight-picker quote, but I read a quote years ago from Winston Churchill that said: \"Show me a man who's 20 and not a liberal, and I'll show you a man with no heart; show me a man who's 40 and not a conservative, and I'll show you a man with no brain.\" Now, what he... and mind you the context in which that quote was made was probably in the late '30s, okay? But I am probably now as an older person, I'm very socially liberal and financially conservative. I think it's because it's you know I earn my living and I pay a lot of taxes; what my topic is... oh my God, and I think it's because that people can say things one on the web.",

What my topic is, I get oh my God, and I think it's because that people can say things online on one platform or um the web or Facebook or or Twitter with complete impunity, yeah, and what they do is they start to pick fights when if you say they'll say things like you know Barack Obama's the Antichrist or George Bush was a Nazi. Well, the problem with that is that you in my view, you automatically lose your place at the table of rational thought right so that you can't you know it's like dude, your ideology is showing so what happens is you become such an ideologue that or not you one becomes such an ideologue that it it sort of turns you to whatever facts are available so that whether you know so if you read The LA Times or the San Francisco Chronicle and you watch MSNBC and Fox News and CNN and whatever to make yourself I mean as you know as knowledgeable as you can about a subject and then have a debate.",

You're just a Republican **** or you you're just one of those other **** bleeding-heart liberals who doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground.

It was his most famous and The Federalist Papers. He says to argue with a man who has renounced the use and authority of reason, and whose uh philosophy consists in holding humanity in contempt is like administering medicine to the dead or endeavoring to convert an atheist by scripture. I love that quote.
