There were these guys like sitting around eating lunch near us, and they all just left. Yeah, did anyone in the park think I'm a legitimate referee and was like, \"Come over here\"? I, I don't have a flag, so I don't think... Oh shoot, uh, sir. Who runs the camera? Go get the go-pro. He loves you; I'm so jealous. He was in my lap for a long time.

I hate it.\" You know?
