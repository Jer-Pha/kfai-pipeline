So obviously it's a movie; it's not a game, games you get to play for all these hours and stuff. The Last of Us is 12 hours, yeah, about that is right if you run around like I do, it takes like 20 'cause I'm like going in every corner looking for things. But let's just say that's a fun way to watch 14 hours for people like 10 at 1:04 movies are an hour and a half to two maybe a little longer if you're crazy. I don't think they're going to go too crazy with this; no, they should what should they cut? How do they make that happen? What do they need to do to nail The Last of Us in movie form? I don't know if we can; the more the more I hear about this, the more I don't even want them to do it. To be honest, I just I mean I stand by the fact I never want them to do video game movies. Video games are their own art form; they are you know. We don't need why are we? Why are we as video game people trying to get the approval of mainstream.",

Uh, do you think it's in the beginning or do you think it's going to be? I hope so because that's what made them. It's it's it's what it's what we called the \"Young Drake\" moment in Uncharted 3, like that was really seminal to telling Uncharted 3's story and I think that was extremely important to put into context his relationship with Ellie. So I think that that has to be in the beginning, and then you can fast forward to Boston. The whole tutorial section is useless; you can put them like right into after like when the gate blows up and stuff like that. You can put them right into the Wilderness when they run into the clickers and stuff. There's like a whole hour an hour and a half that's really tutorial, so like you can even put them fast forward to when they run into you know the",

So that cuts out like the whole beginning of the game with the exception of the beginning with Sarah, which is really important, and then the end is really instrumental too. But again, like when you're climbing into the hospital in Salt Lake City or whatever, there's like a bunch of intense combat and stuff like that. So I think Neil can piece through it and be like, \"The script's big, and it's probably as it is five hours or whatever.\" But you don't have to cut out when we look at it as a 10 to 14 hour game; it's not 10 to 14 hour story, you know what I mean? So I think you know there's like certain... I'm really interested to see how they do Bill, like Bill and the whole experience with Bill and the booby trap town.",

That these that you don't have to go into because it's all about introductions right, and then exploring that character so if you can pull Bill out, give him his relationship qualities to Tess, let it go longer, that'd be a way around it to keep it still to an hour and a half, two hours. Yeah, I think that's a good point, that's a nice point, yeah. I think I just don't like the idea of like something like The Last of Us even being kept to 90 to 120 minutes. I feel like it needs to go a little long, like The Wolf of Wall Street kind of like Django and Chain length, give it another hour, give them some time to flesh things out. But again, the more I think about it, the more I don't want it. Mhm, you know? Like I just I feel like the story was told so well, like Troy Baker's and Ashley Johnson were the heart of",

Did they change what happens at the hospital, like how it all goes down between you know Ellie and Joel, like with that decision that's made at the end. Like, what I mean is it kind of scary to think about what key story pillars they could have made differently right yeah but I mean the fact that it's him though making those decisions doesn't mean that they're going to be bad but isn't he isn't him making pushing him around of course nobody pushes around Neil Druckmann nobody well this is this was the argument he made about The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo which was like since the author of the book was also the screenwriter that at least it's it's the sanctity is there in in terms of maybe what's not best for the product but what's best according to the author which is",

But like, I wonder - I mean, you know these days, like gameplay has all those cinematic moments and all that stuff, so it wouldn't necessarily work. But I wonder if you did cut out all the gameplay, even the ones with the cinematic moments, so it's just the cut scenes and stuff.

For the last three games - Uncharted 2, Uncharted 3, and The Last of Us - are tens in my opinion, all of them.

But you know the look of Joel is something that's going to be hard to replicate with Troy, because of the physical differences between the way he looks in person and what he did vocally. Joel didn't wear enough trendy scarves and hats, yeah. Joel's also significantly older than Troy is, so that's a huge thing. And with film on stage you can get those illusions behind, but like for film it's all type casting.

Even though Nolan North's not a stage actor, you know what I mean. And it's the same when you set the cast in the rhythm for a game with voice acting and with Mads Mikkelsen and then move it to the big screen; the fact of the matter is, it's never going to be pure enough for me because like those are the characters \u2013 Nolan North is Nathan Drake; he's not just playing Nathan Drake; he is Nathan Drake.

Well, The Last of Us really is about the world, and then you get like this, and and it really is, it's this existential thing, you know, where it's like it's about the human condition specifically, and um so maybe that's a different direction they go in or whatever doesn't seem like they're going to do that obviously but then it brings up these conundrums and these problems that I think need to be dealt with, and and uh I don't know how to effectively do it but I I I",
