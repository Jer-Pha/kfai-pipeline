I think Dishonored is a little more likely, yeah Dishonored super likely. Well, Doom's in development, so I don't know like what and it's been in development for a while, so I don't know if there's beta stuff to that. You were trying to get into the Doom beta, wasn't it Rage? Wasn't that it? I thought there was something more recent than that. Hold on, you were trying to go towards event games, yes exactly.

And it's fine, it's fine. And it's like that, you know, that's very representative of Konami of where it was at compared to where it is at. Yeah, and the types of things that it does, Bethesda is now like, 'You guys, we're stepping up.' Not just Wolfenstein, Skyrim, Prey - to a new direction, that's out of this world.

If you're going to do one game then just have your own event outside of E3, unless unless they have something so substantial to show for Fallout 4 that they think that 45 minutes and it's out tomorrow, yeah that'd be awesome.

The game has been rumored to take place in Massachusetts, what they call the Commonwealth and Fallout 4, and I think those rumors have been happening forever. Yeah, exactly. Someone, what was it? Someone from MIT posted that like, \"Hey, they're here checking out our school and doing all these different things.\" So I think that you know it's not beyond the realm of possibility. And I'd like to see it as a test bed, to see, you know. It's the same thing with Grand Theft Auto; like Rockstar really stretched that out, and it was good, and it worked out for them.

Um, and see how they can deliver the graphical fidelity that and and the engine fidelity, the 60 frame smooth 60 frame thing that they're that they're known for, cuz Rage. Um, I liked Rage; I remember being really excited about it as you remember probably. And I played it for like 15 hours, and I just kind of was like, 'I'm going to move on to other things.' But I thought it was a good game. I'm not sure it was C... it showed what they were capable of in a game like Doom if it's like Doom - so kind of like a corridor linear kind of shooter with secrets and stuff like that, but more like Wolfenstein, like what MachineGames did with Wolfenstein.
