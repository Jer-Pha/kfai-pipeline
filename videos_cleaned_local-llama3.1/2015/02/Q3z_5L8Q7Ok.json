Um, and people can decide if they want to read that book and if so, much like with Kickstarter, you can you can back it and say yeah okay, with with Inkshares, it's a little simpler, you just decide I will order this book and I I'm a little bit cheaper, I'll get an ebook that's fine or maybe I'll buy a hardcover version.",

Um what how many drafts do you write before you actually want to show it to someone? Um it really depends on the project. So with the outlining thing, I kind of went back and forth these days. What I do is I I I do just enough of an outline to know where I want roughly the story to go. Like for The Book of Eli, it was a one-page outline, and it was just literally just like 10 story beats.

So where I kind of landed over the years of figuring out this process is: write enough of an outline so you don't get stuck, you don't write yourself into a corner; you always basically know your true north, sure, but keep it vague enough that you can still have the fun of discovering things.",

So, I know you can't talk much about this, but I mean, so to the people out there that the 1% of our audience that hasn't heard of you before: you, you just finished writing the first standalone Star Wars film, yes. Well, at least one version of it. Versus basically what happened is I finished my work; you hand in your work; they say thank you very much; they actually have another writer working on it now.\"",

Um, but there you know that's why I just came back from London, where I was kind of finishing up my work on it. The whole production of the film has moved over to Pinewood now, and you know I handed off my work and said, \"You know, I wish you the best of luck.\" I worked on it for about a year, and by the end of the process, I was just completely exhausted. It was by far the most rewarding creative thing that I ever did; like the entire time I was working on it, the 12-year-old version of me is going to say, \"Dude,\" um, but it was also completely and utterly exhausting because I was so... when it was announced, I got two types of messages on Twitter: one was congratulations.",

This is part two of Nick's topic because Nick's topic is so fascinating and Gary Whitta is so talented. Say I don't, I don't like how you just said that because I think there's places to split it even earlier than this. Greg, see you weren't very organic about it. What's up everybody? Welcome to the GameOverGreggy Show, part two of Nick's topic. Split audible.com. It's going to be weird if it's out of the blue we have to film a pickup and then we say... This is a very un-question but when you're writing a movie are you writing the story or are you literally writing like this guy says this and then that guy says that? You do a little bit of both. You write, you know again I think you go through a process where you write a this just the story and that can be in the form of you know an outline or a treatment that can be anything from...",

That can be anything from what you earlier said, saying \"treatment.\" What is a treatment? A treatment is basically it's the by far the least fun thing that writers have to do - like you have to write a 20- or 30-page very detailed summation of the story but without actually really getting into the story. It's basically like not dialogue, right? It's like if you ask me to say, \"Say you say for example, okay tell me what happens in Die Hard,\" and you've got 20 minutes, and I just basically told you the story of Die Hard in great depth going through it scene by scene, and then wrote that down. You would have a treatment, but that doesn't have dialogue in it. Um, and then you actually go away and write the script, which is you know anywhere between like 100 to 120 pages typically - one page of a written screenplay equals a minute of screen time.",

One page of a written screenplay equals a minute of screen time, so a 120-page script turns into a two-hour film. So you do the treatment first, then from the treatment, you would write it. You write the dialogue and then you also write where everyone is, well, you typically only do a treatment if you're the kind of writer that needs that in their process or if contractually you have to do it. Sometimes studios will demand that you write a treatment before they commence you to the level of writing the script and they'll give you notes on the treatment. And sometimes you'll go back and forth. I've worked on projects where we worked just on the treatment for months before we actually started writing a script, um, but if it's just me, I prefer to do like as I mentioned earlier, I prefer to do as little of that as",
