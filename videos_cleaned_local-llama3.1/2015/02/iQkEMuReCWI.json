We are all in some way shape or form I think a Star Wars fan; I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and that must be such a great obviously great honor, and as you were saying, you know it's a great fear and responsibility that comes along with that too because um, fear leads to hate though. So that that's true, that's a good point. What does hate lead to? No, fear leads to anger, and anger leads to... I don't write the movies; I just watch them clearly. But you know, you were talking about you, the stress of writing a Star Wars movie and doing right by it, especially you know, and I think a lot of people are concerned about that, especially with how divisive the prequels are to a lot of people, and how sacred I think the",

Abrams wrote These amazing books about the about the making of the original trilogy and how the films were received when they first came out and there was all this tremendous anticipation for Empire but when it came out it really threw a lot of people because wait this is suddenly much look at the tone of the original Star Wars which is really um it's just fun it's",

Like yeah, see that's what I think I liked most about it though is the characters seemed way more real in Empire and you empathize with them a lot more than you do in A New Hope. But you're like they're going to win at the end of this movie we know they're going to win, you're everything all signs point to they're getting those medals at the end except for I guess Chewbacca who got just to out no I never did I never well was I had a huge crush on Princess Leia I was I was kind of looking at her too busy looking at Princess Leia a little bit.

Yeah, you have the luxury of, you know, having often times if you do like a TV pilot or an origin story movie there's a certain amount of real estate you have to set aside just to set everyone up and then when you do the second one you get to hit the ground running with those characters that you already know um so I guess it kind of",

Like Star Wars has the original Star Wars has tons of aliens in it, right? Loads of really has has a Cen there's nothing but like crazy aliens. The Empire Strikes Back has almost no aliens in it. Think about it: where were the aliens in The Empire? That's right; just the bounty hunters and they sleep. What was the guy he was was he an alien? He's like a guy, he like an Android. Have you got the guys that are down in the scrap peep? You know, Chewbacca has to go down and like get C-3PO's parts back from right but apart from that there you think again typically if they if if they were doing this today, \"Oh, the kids loved the aliens in Star Wars; let's make sure they have tons more in the next one.\" But they",

But anyway, I was just thinking about like from an act to act basis it's just it's dark like The Empire Strikes Back. Like and it's so the story's clever too because and we've talked about this before, I think Greg and I talked about it specifically that why I love Empire as well.

Like, what is it about him that makes him an important character because he delivers Han to Jabba and that starts the whole thing, and stuff like that. It's necessary, but why do people love him? You know, he has basically like three minutes of airtime. That's why I think that is. And do you love him? I think I think it's just generally true as a character thing that we find mysterious characters really compelling, and mystery is interesting. You know, this goes all the way back to uh, you know, The Man with No Name, and kind of, you know, mythic characters where the point is that they're shrouded in mystery, and you never really truly get to know who they are.",

Like Boba Fett shows up and he's got this cool armor and it's like this seems like a badass dude, like I want to know more about him. But the fact that they kind of keep you a little bit in the dark, it's like it leaves you wanting more, which is the which is of course the great anytime you can do that and and just suggest and let audiences kind of fill in the blanks on their own.

All I refer you to my previous answer about how I had a lot of fun working on the movie and I look forward to seeing it when it comes out in December 2016. Gotcha! Abomination is available now on iTunes, I think. I couldn't have played doing that, but I thought it would have been too cheesy. No don't worry, I think it's good when you do cheesy things, remember?

Seven movies for it not to be I mean, I I love that and I love what they did with Wolverine as well, in his standalone story.
