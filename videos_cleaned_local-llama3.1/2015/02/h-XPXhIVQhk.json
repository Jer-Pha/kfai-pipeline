Cool little thing you can actually control the loading screen by pressing up and down, which is one of those weird secrets that people don't really know about. So the game starts by playing Requiem of Souls (RoR) and you start at the end of the game, but it's actually the end of a previous adventure or prequel to what we're doing now, so we'll get to cross whatever and by the way Nick, I'm just going to warn you, yeah, the voice acting here is notorious. It's what it is, and you're going to see okay in just a minute.

Well you're not making those jumps so now he'll turn into his monster form if you want to fight him like this. Oh that's significantly scarier, I would start with that if I were Dracula. So Maria comes out and she'll revive you. And if you play the Saturn version of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Maria will be playable. Wow it's the only version of the game she's playable.

That's a good question, I don't really have all the answers. They say some of the best stories are set in New York City, same thing as Harlem. Greg, shut up, this is my moment to shine. One of the great things about Castlevania games you see here and you saw in the beginning even though the 3D graphics are very crude, yeah, is the castle, it's one of the best parts of Castle, being the way they image it, I love the tets and like how they branch off of each other in like really",

It really indicates like the steps up to his castle or to his hideout, kind of layer area. Which we just understand. I just love the imagery of the castle - this awesome shot. Bless you. They still haven't made a castle in this good ever. They've tried what at what point did they go 3D with Castlevania? Uh, the first 3D Castlevania game was on N64, Castlevania 64. Okay, and then they made a sequel to that called Legacy of Darkness. How was that? I thought they were good. A lot of people didn't like those games at the time but I thought they were underrated. I thought they were fine games - they were just so... now we're going to play the actual game. Now, you're not Richter Belmont anymore. No, now we're Alucard. Who were we in",

Now we're Alucard, who were we in the first one? Simon Belmont, okay. So they just come from a long legacy of Belmonts that got basically the short end of the stick. They always have to go after Dracula exactly, and Alucard is the son of Dracula. What's Alucard spelled backwards? Dracula, yes. And he's first introduced in Castlevania III as a friend of Trevor, Trevor is Simon's dad. So Dracula took a Belmont woman, knocked her up, and then they had a kid. How did this work out? It's not quite how it worked out, no. I'm not entirely sure to be honest. How they get those... how they get the giant wolves in now, man. Like I don't know, that's not a question I've pondered them so see there's a leveling system. So this is one of the great things about this game. First of all it's Arcadia, it's quick.

So the Necklace of Maria gives you plus five defense; the Cloak just a black cloak for vampires in said Alucard male gives you resistance. So he has all this great equipment on right now, but the fact of the matter is that Alucard is very strong right now, but he won't be for very long. Why is that? I'm going to show you; Shaft is going to have something to do with it. Shaft taking a break from The Busy Streets of Harlem to come so here we go. Is this the first boss battle? Is this Shaft?

So he gave me a different sword, so let's see what it's stronger. The red rust is a two-handed sword that doesn't seem... Let's try it. I'm going to keep I'm going to stay on this one. I like the swords a little quicker. Okay, so this is a save point. Oh, running how to save your games manually? So to go in here you have to press up and then the coffin comes and saves your game that's cool. So Alucard's clearly not human, no he's not. He's a vampire got it okay I think he's half and half always like blade so here's uh all the benefits of being a vampire none of the drawbacks.

So that's another layer of the game. What is the point of turning them off? Some of them are annoying, like you can find things that will tell you item names or enemy names and all this kind of stuff, it causes some clutter on the screen sometimes. So some people just like to shut them off. So now in the Alchemy Laboratory, so there's all these different sections of the map but again they're interconnected. So eventually this whole screen when you press select is going to be a full map okay. And the beauty of this game is that you like there's a fake ending and a real ending right.

I just would buy anything with Castlevania on it right, so I I had no expectations but it ended up being an extraordinary game and um an extraordinary influential game.

Yeah, I definitely see the progression.

And the axe of course, a very powerful weapon. Well I'm keeping the axe now. This is a boss fight, so let's see how you do. This is the first boss fight in the game. It's you have to go over the right. Make me wait for it. Careful, you have like only one more use and you're low on HP. You might want to um oh God, you might want to press uh start and go to equip and go to uh and your leather shield replace with your potion. Um and then go back into the game press Circle really quickly. That should give you some health. And then yeah, the F52 so you're a little more equipped to take these guys on. Yeah, these guys I go back and I reequip that shield. Yeah, you can it should give you some added defense. Do I have to pull it out? You don't have to pull it out. It should just give you defense automatically but it can block projectiles, block.",

There, um, it is our Game of the Month or for our Video Game Book Club; we're playing this together and enjoying it together just like we did with Super Metroid last month; um, and it seemed like a logical conclusion uh to since Super Metroid was our first game and Super Metroid really begot Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, which then begot a bunch of other games, of course; Symphony of the Night is better than Super Metroid, but that's for we'll leave that for the conversation of course; uh, so for more on all things video games, more things Castlevania, all things fun and retro and old and all things new and fresh and Nick Scarpino I'm fresh and old he's fresh and old keep it tuned to Kinda Funny Games.",
