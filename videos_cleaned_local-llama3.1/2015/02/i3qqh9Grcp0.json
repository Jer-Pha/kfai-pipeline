This is Nick Scarpino, that's Greg Miller, and this is a review discussion - a very civil review discussion of a little uh, you know, a film, an independent movie masterpiece called Fifty Shades of Grey. This is a very important cultural phenomenon when you want to know about this sexy weird movie with all the sex, you want to see it from these three guys, you want to hear these three guys who went to an 8:00 p.m. showing - a premier showing, basically a midnight showing in San Francisco. Two of them sat in the front row with some friends behind them, and then one crazy creepy guy sat all the way in the back with the front row by the way, could you see what was happening? It really wasn't bad; it wasn't. It was disorienting, obviously, but it wasn't like the other movies. It was Sundance here in the Kabuki Theatre in San Francisco. Yeah, you were out in a little bit. Let's let's set the stage a bit first so you called and you were",

I knew half of them, I didn't know the other half of them.\" They rented out the entire or not rented but they they got the entire second row. This was already an essentially sold-out experience. So he you call me and you say, \"Hey, the only seats we can get to the front row, but I think we should sit in front of these girls because I think it would be fun to just hear what their reaction to this film is going to be.\" And I'm like, \"I don't know if I can focus on it; it'll give me a headache and it ruined Gladiator for me basically cuz I sat too close. I could very similar there was different action in this one, it wasn't the same amount of action. They fight a lion in both of them.\" Um so I sit down by myself.",

The chemistry between them was not helped by the fact that it felt like the film was written by a 16-year-old boy and then did who did one draft and then went straight into production with it. Um, the dialogue - I like the line where he's like \"I'm 50 Shades **** up,\" and it was just like, \"That's from the book,\" like that's not exactly, but that doesn't make it okay. Like it's just it's so so bad, it's just one of those things.

No, that makes more sense in terms of why every time he touches her she was moaning because like I was watching like he's not even doing anything but that like she was like gasping and moaning. To me it reads like a young adult book where it was like okay in a young adult book you got the perfect man, Christian Grey, and the perfect woman, Anastasia Steele, and they get together and then they just have to figure one little small thing out which in this case was one of them's horribly addicted to abusive behavior toward women.
