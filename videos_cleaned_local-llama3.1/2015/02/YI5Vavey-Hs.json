But you did come up with the idea that we need to sell the Tim shirt on DistrictLines.com - that is just a black V-neck, yeah. It's genius, and that's all it is.

Now that we've shampooed it, let's go style it. When it comes to drying, I like to air dry, like Cuba Gooding Jr. from the movie Jerry Maguire. I got a little light towel but I never blow dry because blow drying destroys the hair. Before we get to styling, I want to talk to you a little bit about hair loss prevention. There are two main drugs in the market right now that you can use for that - one is called Finasteride, which is the generic version of Propecia, and the other one is called Rogaine, which I'm sure you've seen the men's hair Rogaine commercials all that stuff before.\"",

It might not work for you, so go talk to a professional. But I'll show you how I do it now. Propa is a pill that you take by mouth once a day, not anally as I came to learn the hard way. It tastes like a pill. I just started using this next product, so jury's still out as to how well it works. I stand by the Propa, but as far as the Rogaine is concerned, we got a month or two before I can actually tell anyone if it's working for me. But the goal is to really fill in these little spots right here and try to get my drum major hairline back. And I'll show you how I do that. Take a little bit of this back boy right here.

The that that light Bumble and Bumble hairspray it actually goes away after a while. I can run my hand through my hair, I don't feel like it's a hair helmet, and then it gets kind of a little bit more volume in it not not right now but throughout the day as you kind of keep rubbing your hand through your hair that all that stuff kind of stays and gets a little more volume to it.
