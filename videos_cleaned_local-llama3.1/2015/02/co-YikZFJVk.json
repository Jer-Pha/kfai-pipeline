But no, that's the thing of like how much that means to me now. Like you know at the time you don't even think about it, but you know how happy he was just to take me and be there with me and do something with me that was fun. Yeah, I'm from North Dakota, so there were no conventions when I was growing up. But I also uh developed a love of video games with my dad.

And uh, it was so awesome because me and Greggy won - we won a video contest to go down to E3, which started my whole career at IGN and stuff, so that was awesome. But um, we got tickets for Sony's thing; we got to go to the actual press conference, and we lost our minds when Kevin Butler came out with this: \"This is the best thing.\" I don't want to play favorites, but press conference day - Sony always has the best experience at the conference. It's always way better than Nintendo's, always. But they have um, they don't do it anymore exactly; they have like their Direct, and the food trucks are awesome, and everything.

But until you know they can overcome that idea that the Vita doesn't do anything else but play games, you know they're never going to really grab onto the American Market. I mean, the 3DS has done a better job of it. Um, but I think that's because a lot of um gamers in you know the West in particular just have a longer love affair with Nintendo than they do with PlayStation.
