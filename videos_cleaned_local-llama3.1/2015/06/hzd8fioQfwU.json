I like this topic and I I did tease you guys with it a little bit because I wanted I didn't want to blindside you. Get my laptop. Oh, is this one you put? Is it one of these guys' glasses ones? No, it shouldn't. Which shouldn't require any any any real thought on that in that you're still making that face. I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not. I was posing well; he looks that up. Um, don't worry about it, Kevin. It's too late now. You two topics in Kevin wants to give us Superman bring Superman over here. Kevin, no, that Superman smells funky. You smell funky. He's filled with change. He smells like rubber and butthole. Jesus. Um, while Colin's looking that up, Greg, I had a great time uh watching you play Batman in my Batman costume yesterday.

Having said that, Season Two - still like a nine out of ten, it's still awesome. Yeah, I mean it's still a beautifully made show. It's unfortunate that it has to get compared to itself really. I mean you're comparing it to the last four seasons which are arguably four of the best seasons of television ever made. And so yeah, it's going to be a season that pales to the rest of them of course in comparison. It was slow, this slow and also I think that parts of it weren't in the books from what I understand.

Flash season one was great because it's been building toward it - it was a complete arc. We're building towards this finale, you knew this is how it's going to go, and that's why when they pick up Flash season 2, are they going to be able to establish that rhythm again and do a new thing or or is it just going to be now it's freak of the week - there's a million things to fight, and that loses it.

Yeah, well, that's and granted when this thing wraps up, I will completely turn one in. He'll be like that was awesome great storytelling but right now in this moment after season 5 is over, I'm not as enthralled with the series as I was even at the end of season four. Yeah, well to be fair at the end of season four I was like \"I don't know what they're going to do in five to keep me entertained.\" Like they've done every style of redemption arc and like every type of surprise kill and every type of like twist already; what are they going to do?
