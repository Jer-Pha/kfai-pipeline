This episode is anime characters, anime - the reason it's anime is cuz this episode's brought to you by Crunchyroll, that later Crunchyroll, great site for all your anime needs and stuff. So let's start off with this guy Nick okay who is he and what's he from? He is from Naruto, damn all right you're good you're good I don't know who he is though. Okay I'm going to call him Splash, Splash from Naruto, why would you go splash? I don't know he's got a ball it looks like it's got water in it maybe it's a crystal ball maybe it's got energy in it I don't know fair enough fair enough uh he looks a little like one of the guys from Dragon Ball right remember like the guy from Dragon Ball doesn't he have like five different iterations of himself, one of which is blonde yes so that's what this guy kind of looks",

His name is Naruto. Oh, that's Nuto, I don't know how to say it. Might it might be Naruto? It's Narut, is it? I don't know, say it again, Naruto. Okay, we're going to go. I believe, I think, and I'm not a linguist, mhm. Nor I, I barely speak English most of the time. I took about three years of Italian, and for the most part, I failed. But in Italian, you usually put the emphasis on the last syllable, yeah. I believe in Japanese, for the most part, you put the emphasis on the first syllable. So like a lot of people, for instance, uh, like you would say Naruto because in English we can cut from Latin base language, you would put it on that the second-last syllable, Naruto, Naruto. But I believe in Japanese is Narut, got it? So you would be Nick and I would be Tim, no, you would be Tim and I",
