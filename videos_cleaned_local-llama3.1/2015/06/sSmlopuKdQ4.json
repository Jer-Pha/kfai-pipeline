This is Portillo and we're in my Fortress of Solitude, which means I'm going to give you an extra long let's play today. Today we're playing Batman: Arkham Knight. And full disclosure, as I jump in right here to it, you can see that I'm what 37% through the game. Now, that's including everything and I'm further through the story. So, today I won't be doing story missions. I'll be doing side missions, running around Gotham City. However, might be getting phone calls, might be talking to people on the street that spoil elements of the game. I can't predict that and I can't stop it. So, I'm sorry if you want no spoilers for the entire story because I'm getting close. I think I'm like 70% way through the story. Uh, you might want to bail. Don't read the loading screen that's coming up here in a second cuz up in the corner it puts up words and it says stuff like current objectives",

Portillo, don't look at it. He's been here the whole time, but he's he doesn't have headphones on like I do. He doesn't know what's actually happening in the game.

So, here like this part of car combat is really fun where it's like, all right, now we're going to knock knock knock out, you know, the car here that Uncle Ben's killers in.

I'm going to show you a fear multi-takedown. I go down like this. I go one, one, two over here. Hey, look who's back. Let's just clean up the streets a bit here as you do in old Gotham. Eventually, I'll get back to showing you what I like and don't like about the battle wheel. This is how it works in Batman: Arkham Knight. **** A million things going on. All right. All right.

Guess it wouldn't be Gotham without a crazy pyro running loose, huh? You know, the chief always said we'd get through it, but I don't know anymore. Not after this. Everything's going to be okay. You'll be safe with the rest of your men back at GCPD. So, there you go. I'm going to get an upgrade point for it. Hooray. Now, I'm going to come down here and do this other one. Now, this is what I'm talking about. So, using the bat wheel to get around, fight enemies, knock cars off the streets, a lot of fun.

Direct hit on the Rattler. This is it. Like this is though now again this is like one side mission. So you're like that's not that bad.

Like right now, I'm doing this by choice obviously. Remember when your mom was like, \"You'll never use geometry in school,\" and there are all these cute angles around you right now, like no, Batman's taking out a rattler drone offline.
