Yeah, it's like if you can train yourself to do that, like I feel that gives you an understanding of music on a deeper level than most other things, so you'd be able to jump onto other instruments. Piano was interesting because I took piano lessons for a year and I was okay, but um, but it was challenging instrument to play because the first instrument I played in school was saxophone, and I liked it, but it was just... I was like, this is not what I'm into, and I started playing drums by myself, then I took lessons later and became quite proficient.

You don't sit down and like Danny Elfman doesn't sit down in front of his lead guitar and go okay I'm gonna write like the Batman theme. No, you sit in front of a piano and that's sort of how everything starts when you're writing music. So like I think my my I think everyone has to learn piano. Like my buddy Scott is a band director, I'm pretty sure like you have to you have to have a functional knowledge of that instrument. Yeah it's hard man, I took a couple months of it and just it my head wouldn't click with it.

I just always thought guitar because it's the power instrument, it is the instrument that is upfront in the sound of any rock band or any alt band or any band that really uses guitar. So yeah, I would always, I I would just want that, I would want to be able to do that and sing at the same time cuz I always thought that was fascinating. I've always admired people that can play guitar eloquently and also like sing Melody cuz again that's another thing I can't do if you gave me like Rock Band or not Rock Band a Guitar Hero and said okay while you're doing this Sing the lyrics, I just I would no, I can't my bra.

I'm like, I should have taken snare from this early age because I played sax for like half a year, and I'm like, \"I don't want to play this thing.\" Yeah, that's me. Play yeah, I played all of the sax back in school, man. Junior High, man. Sax. I always was, I'm glad I never played sax just because I did so much marching band. That like, the trumpet - one trumpet can stand out in a marching band way more than any woodwind instrument can because they just cannot produce the same volume of sound that a brass instrument can produce, especially a brass instrument that that uh, the frequency comes out that high of a level. So I'm glad I play Trumpet. I love trumpet, and in a marching band, trumpet is like the lead instrument. So it was amazing nice.",
