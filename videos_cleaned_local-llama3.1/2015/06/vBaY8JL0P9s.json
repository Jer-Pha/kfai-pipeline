MomoCon had a great time, con - it is the Peach Con, it's the con for uh all the peach growers of Atlanta, thankfully they get to be a part of that show no um these conventions always fascinate me because um people go for a different a lot of different reasons but I think the number one reason they go is is is for camaraderie right they get to be around like-minded uh friends uh in our case uh our community gets to sort of meet each other in person for the first time sometimes um I love hearing the fact that people uh you know come together and",

You feel great all the time I felt like **** yes yeah all the time uh cosplay and then a shout out before I passed the Baton to anybody else at MomoCon there was an awesome shovel knight walking run yes awesome for me. Cosplay is really interesting because you know when you're first exposed to it, it's kind of just like oh it's like Halloween when it's not Halloween, just people in costume but then it's like once you get into a level that we are just by default of the industries that we cover, you realize that it's like it is not just costumes, it's different, there's a very distinct",

And that's not to say that you can't just buy the stuff and that doesn't count or whatever, 'cause like there is something to looking like the person and like wearing the right costume for who you are or whatever it is for who you are.

I forget if it was Vampy or if it was Meg, but one of them was getting super excited because they were going to learn leather making - you know what I mean?

My favorite thing about cosplay is watching other people who have no idea what's going on look at people in cosplay. And when you're in places like we were at MomoCon, where you're in the CNN Center, there's a lot of serious people there. And then you know, in the hotel where a lot of people are staying, I just... my favorite thing was watching them watch cosplayers. Um, my story about that and let's get back to it is the fact that I remember once I got a cab at PAX Prime, and I saw how when you leave PAX, no, I'm sorry, PAX East, you walk out and there's that Westin in there. I got the cab there, I Ubered it, and I came around the corner, and then we were stuck in traffic trying to get out of the Westin, and Vampy was over there, and she was in her Zero Suit Samus outfit with the Metroid-like thing on her hat or by her head. And the guy's like, \"What?\"",
