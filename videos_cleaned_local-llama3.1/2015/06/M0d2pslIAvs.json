Okay? Um, have you ever had a need for it yet? So here's my thing: so I remember when I first met you about 5 years ago, yeah, you gave me a lot of advice right off. Great, great uh advice from a person who's a senior manager to an intern, yes. Advice number one was have sex with anything that moves. Okay, advice good advice. Advice number two: don't sleep where you eat, yo. So don't which directly goes against advice number one, but just don't have sex with coworkers. Advice number three: always use a condom. Always and advice number four: always use lube. They sell little packets of it okay? If you think you're going to go out and have a good time and be safe and content during sex, uh, just have that as a backup because you know what you can't always rely on your machismo to keep things lubricated, that's the thing.",

Always practice safe sex, especially if you're having contentual sex, though uh that can dry out things very quickly, yeah. And guys don't get offended by that, like if a girl is being open and honest with you, really support that, Embrace that because that's a hard thing to do, it's hard to like tell somebody hey, I need a little help in this way or whatever, and that's totally fine, support it, make her feel comfortable because that's the most important thing about any sexual Escapade, yes, you need to feel comfortable, you need to know that they feel comfortable with you. The advice I can give you is use lube, it's dime sized, you take a little dime sized bit, you kind of put it on the penis and then you put it in. I mean I like to, I basically like you know sometimes I like to just kind of like get my whole body involved in it, like I'll start at the chest right, I'll just",
