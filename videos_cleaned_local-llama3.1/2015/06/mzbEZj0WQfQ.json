So day two, I'm dropped off, and we're going to go, and you're right into it, you're shooting, you're stunts, you're running, you're doing stuff. Now of course you skip the story so I have no idea what's happened right, you're just murdering people yeah why not I guess not this looks like a a few different games combined you know what I mean it's got the the murder I'm not very good at that I got I got a SL basically what you have to do is you have to slide in the cover see like when I'm dark here I'm I'm sliding in the cover and then I'm out so I you have to kind of use the on the Xbox one or Xbox 360 controller it's the A button there you go see now",

I I'm not playing it quite right because I don't have a you know I've just I really just started playing the game so like I don't have the rhythm. Like I said, it's a game that's easy to understand but very difficult to master, you know? So it's uh you know on the bottom of the screen here you'll see um three different things: kill all the Mobsters obviously, but you know Critical Hits, slide tackles, executions. Is that your mission objective or is that just like addition? I think it's probably just additional stuff that you can do if you want to do. You have like regenerating Health it looks like. Do you feel like you're not a hero? I don't feel like say Not a Hero; no, I mean I'm not a hero. It's being very obvious in what it's trying to tell me so I'm going to jump out this window here.

I mean, that's what bad guys do too; terrorists would do that, they blow a bunch of people away, they jump on their and they do their thing. So now I'm going to try to play it a little cleanly because you know I have about 2 minutes of experience with the game, so let's see if we can do it a little better. Uh, we'll continue on Bunny Lord is fun Club, bunny Lord is bad. Colin, I don't think you that's why you're not a hero. I'm sick of hearing from bunny, so I'm going back in here GNA to pick Steve again day two, day three, I'm sorry, day three.
