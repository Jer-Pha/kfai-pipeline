The full episode goes up on Friday; you can get it early at Patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames. But what's interesting about this is E3 is like two weeks out from now, but how we're recording it now, we're going to be making predictions and stuff, and it's going to be a little thrown off because when people are listening to this - no matter when they're listening to it, even if it's early - usually the show isn't as topical.

Well, no, we had an official from the show; I thought I thought it was 15; we settled on did you go I'm going up to 20 okay so both of us can possibly be right about this interesting interesting Colin will be discussed for only 20 minutes or less. The primary reason I think this is because the games cannot be effectively shown, but I think that there will be connectivity with games that you don't expect as one of my predictions will reveal, but it's hard it's hard to show VR on a stage like that and I think they're smart enough to not do it for very long. See I think they're going to have a way to do it; I just think they won't. I mean it'll just be first-person shooting looking. I really hope that it it falls in like that five minutes to make Colin right and you wrong, why? Why I know been fun. I'll give you some other ones, Greg.

So I really do think that they know that they can't tether that game's success to Morpheus, but they can work on Morpheus and move into it if you want to use it, but otherwise it's a game you can play without it using this dual shock for. I think that that is probably the reason why the game has taken so long because Media Molecule has been quiet for a very long time; they haven't put out an understanding of their core team hasn't put out a game since 2011, so it's it you know they've released terribly but that team was about 12 to 15 people porting that game probably wasn't even done internally to PS4.

Um, but I think that this is Morpheus is the reason why this game is delayed. Interesting, and my hope is that it's optional. I hope so because that would be the end of Media Molecule if they put that thing only on Morpheus. Like, because it's just going to limit its sales, and no one game is going to make someone buy Morpheus. It's about making an ecosystem of options for people, so I do think that. But I mean, but that's the whole thing - what I still just don't believe in Morpheus and don't trust in, and they can't do that. They can't give you the out because if they give you the out, they don't buy the Morpheus, and then it's just over and over and over again.

MH we'll see I think I wouldn't be surprised if everything you most of what you just said was true except it's Morpheus locked you need Morpheus for it yeah that would be such a waste I mean I you're saying it's true's doing the same thing though it's locked to the Move which is another dead technology. That's God I'm just saying Move because it seemed like they already had worked out that tech and I'm not sure if they still sell or even manufacture Move anymore my assumption is that they probably do um in some capacity sell it at least they probably have a whole warehouse of that stuff that no one wanted but they seem to have worked something out in 2013 with Move I mean it was clear and Move clearly works with PlayStation 4 so yeah based",

I know, I know, it's weird 'cause I think Sony London is the studio that's making all these other games plus they have their new studio that's making Morpheus games too, so they have at least two and a half studios working on Morpheus stuff right? Something will come out of Japan Studio presumably. My my assumption is that PS4 is probably going to have significant Morpheus interaction with Gran Turismo, so it's not like there's like all sorts of **** that's not happening behind the scenes presumably there is you know sure and studios like Naughty Dog and Sucker Punch are not gonna make Morpheus games. So sounds like they have more than 15 minutes of **** about Morphy to talk about.

You have to assume that whatever the new God of War game is is probably not anywhere near being ready so maybe 2017; so that's a game you'd show next season.
