We've done that a million times or whatever. And they were like, 'Well maybe we'll do a little bit more,' and it became that whole thing you just saw. It became all of this, it became the craziness you're about to still go through. You're not even halfway through this night; like they took it to a place that I'll never be able to repay them for.
