But at the same time, I agree with you, it's like well the PS1 can run these games so much better than any S or X, any of those systems. Let's just get out of here, yeah, let's just throw as much stuff on screen as possible. And you know, you got to balance your game; it just seems a little unbalanced in the visual side.

And one night, Reppergrams all the robots to help him take over the world except for Mega Man and R. He looks at it, Mega Man is just basically our lab assistant, oh I see, and is useless. So he takes all the robots he thinks like L to help him, and you lose Mega Man alone, big mistake, Repper, and so yeah, he made a huge mistake, and so that's the story. And then Mega reprograms Mega Man to help him fight becomes a super fighting robot, Mega Man, and then uh, that's basically it. I can't take any more this game, take it, that's it, I can't take at Le come out of the ground for no reason and electrocute you to death, it's time to stop these robot, these robot fights are too much, so that's Mega Man 8.

Uh, maybe I'll actually sit down and figure the game out again for the first time since I was in high school, and then maybe we'll do like a real proper, slick play one day, but probably not. Uh, but if you are interested in trying Mega Man 8, you can play it on your PS1 or your Saturn if you so desire. I believe it's also available on PS2 and GameCube in the Mega Man collection that was released in 2004, and then you can buy it as a PS1 classic uh for PS3 and Vita. Um, so you have some options if you want to go try it yourself. Uh, thank you for sitting through this. Uh, I hope you guys enjoyed it. You guys have asked me many times to play it, so I succumbed to your requests. My name is Colin, this is Nick. We'll see you next time on Kinda Funny Games every weekday for a new let's play bye bye bye",
