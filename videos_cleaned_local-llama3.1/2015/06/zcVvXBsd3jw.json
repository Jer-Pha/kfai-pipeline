You are landing on another thing and stuff's going to start happening. Another thing, yeah. What they call them, it's a planet or it could be a comet or an asteroid or a moon. No, we're going, we're going to say planetoid. There it is. That's a planet. It looks like a planet to me. So here we go. How much of how much do you know about Lifeless Planet? Nothing. It's a puzzle game. Okay. I didn't score. You know I'm not very good at puzzle games. That's like my one weakness, like my kill switch. Figure out we're not going to play forever. We're going to get deep into it. The first puzzle is going to be like, hey, can this circle piece fit in this circle hole? Oh, you'll be surprised. It did. Whoa, space! All right, the landing side now. Let's see here. There's an American flag, a German flag, a Japanese flag. Looks like a UN flag, UNICEF flag, UNICEF flag, no.

Now we're getting the puzzle here, we go. You want to give me? My head is foggy, damn. He's doing the voices too; he's good. The sound of my breath puffing in my helmet is hollow and distant. It's hard to tell how long I've been unconscious, and I'm worried that I might have a concussion. I wish I could lay back down and rest, see if the pain passes, but the situation is far too critical, far too critical to call that a hard landing would be kind. We crashed, damn it. Maybe the Eggheads miscalculated the trajectory or maybe we just had a spell of bad luck. Whatever the case may be, this is not the paradise they described to us back home. There is no lush greenery; there is no sign of life at all, and where is my crew? I hope they're just securing a perimeter, and that I was out.",
