One of the nicest people I've ever met and we don't talk about the nice people enough so I wanted to spend a topic talking about the nice people in our lives. I'm starting with MomoCon, I mean, MomoCon in general. I think nice people was like an overwhelming thing that just kept happening yeah like down in Atlanta people were very nice yes it was like kind of weird oh shg Patreon our progress yeah I think that especially like we talk a lot about Comic Con E3 those are we see the industry side of that right but you have to understand if you're going to be around us a group of people who are into that specific subject, like matter basically nerd quote unquote nerd culture even though I don't necessarily like agree or like that term um just because like spoilers nerd culture is mainstream culture now so like",
