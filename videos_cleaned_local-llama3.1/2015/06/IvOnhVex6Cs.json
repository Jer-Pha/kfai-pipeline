And we have one rule on this channel: we only talk about stuff that's not your girlfriend. Get shot, man! Are you in the friend zone? You have to ask yourself that question. Okay, that is the most important question, and it's a very, very important skill to hone when you're young because it will save you a lot of time and emotion. When you guys are chatting back and forth and hanging out, does she view this as a friendship or relationship? And you know in your heart, really look in your heart and ask yourself that question. And if the answer is yes, you're in the friend zone. Get out! Evacuate the Dance Floor - I don't even think you need to go that far. She has a boyfriend, so it's just like... the question you might be asking yourself a lot of times these days when you're 17 years old.",

And guess what? If it happens to you, it can happen again to you, and that's all bad because you don't want your entire relationship to be based on \"home wrecking,\" such a bad standard. The other thing too is when you're 17, bro, there are so many other people out there that you could be dating, and that's what you should be looking at\u2014you should be looking at who else you can date, not who you can get to leave someone else for you. And also sometimes it's nice to just meet other people, spend some time with them, maybe it doesn't work out, maybe it's not she's the one for you, and then maybe Cassie is available, and it works out. Yeah, that it's going to be okay; you know, you can't rob the bank because then",
