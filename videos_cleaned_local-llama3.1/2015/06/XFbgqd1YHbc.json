There was a lot of stuff that happened, and I think that the fact is, there's a lot of characters who have a lot of stuff happen to them. Let's let's recap a little bit what happened in this season right? Uh, um... They've started from small things, like this isn't in any particular order, but they killed Daenerys' daughter, Jemmy's daughter, no, I mean, she got... Which wait, let's talk about Dorne. Let's talk about that place; it's an antidote for everything you just do. You want to just need to hold it like this? No, let me just... Let me just tell you: just make sure it's close.

Um, I just what a fun character he like what a fun time he must have playing that character where he just gets to do those scenes like that one scene where he's just like \"All right, I'm sorry guys, I wasn't feeling that. Can we get one more take on her taking off...like taking out her perfect breasts one more time?\" That scene was crazy sexy and she had that short like boy haircut which I don't know why it just made a whole lot of emotions in my head that maybe it unlocked something that I didn't know was there.

Right? Like, there are two types of characters: they're the innocent Stark-type characters and then there's the Targaryen character which is the older like \"I've been through all this, I survived it, and now I have to be this way because that's the only way you can survive\" - basically being ruthless and a tyrant.
