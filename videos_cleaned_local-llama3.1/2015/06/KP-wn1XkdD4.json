We're playing it on Xbox One, but it's also available on PlayStation 4 and PC. Uh, and now, Tim, yes, were you a fan of Devil May Cry 4 when it came out? It came out in 2008 for PS3, Xbox 360, and PC. I was not; you weren't. It was pretty well-regarded, if I remember correctly. Uh, it got an 88 on Metacritic, and so I... which is better than say Devil May Cry 2. Well, that's the thing: one came out, and everyone loved one because it was awesome, and then two came out, and was one of the worst things it was the equivalent of the Star Wars prequels to the video game world. Okay, it was very upsetting, very very very upsetting, and then three came out... what am I even doing here? Let's see, Devil Hunter is the difficulty, I think; whatever we're going with, devil Hunter automatic, whatever tutorial. Let's go on all right so two.",

Interesting, not good, and a lot of people didn't like that. I was surprised when I looked at the Metacritic for this game how well it did, cuz my assumption was that it disappeared for a while or it was given to another developer because people didn't like it, but it scored well enough. L weight's nothing to sneeze at. I always love the um sound effects and like the music in these games is just so ridiculous, it's so funny to look at some of the textures though and the way some of the geometry is built still there's nothing you can do in an HD remake to make that look better.

Uh, if you're watching this video, this game is available because the embargo for the game was the day the game comes out, so you can find it on PlayStation 4 on Xbox One and also on PC. The rumble of the Xbox One controller just scared him a little. If you want to play the original version of Devil May Cry 4, they came out in 2008, you can do that on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC as well. Um, all right, that's basically it for us. Oh, shit's getting real... is getting real. Later though we're good, we're good on this, we're good on this. All right, thanks for joining us. We'll see you next time in Kinda Funny Games. Bye.",
