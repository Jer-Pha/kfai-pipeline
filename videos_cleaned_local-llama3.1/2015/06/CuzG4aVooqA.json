That's the difference. I'm going to go for you; this is the easy answer. Colin was right, that's really good. I like producer Seducer though, I mean, Producer Seducer would work for me, story of Seduction yeah and production, that's the tale in protheses and a little bit of production. But I would want it if someone made a documentary about me; I would want to write it and I would want it to be completely false, just completely nonsensical and completely like the opposite of a biopic but that wouldn't that be more fun?

The thing about documentaries is that, you know, Greg's documentary story is complete nonsense. The reality is if we ever did a documentary where they were like \"oh let's go back and talk to Colin's teachers or something\" they'd all be like \"who the **** are you talking about?\" it's been 20 years I've had thousands of pupils since then, he was a very unremarkable person clearly.
