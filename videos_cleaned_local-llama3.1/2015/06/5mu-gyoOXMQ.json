Now the topic here is I know that those are not either or any of our favorite genres sure but it's more about wanting to know what your positive memories are about them or what your thoughts are on them in general and uh if there's anything they could do to win you back. The reason we're discussing this is Need for Speed, just the reboot or whatever it is, refresh whatever the hell we're going to call it. We saw a trailer for that also we're getting a little bit more Street Fighter 5 stuff coming out and people are getting really excited about Just Released To For Street Fight - just released yeah and you guys played that for a little bit I want to know what kind of your thoughts in it because for me Street Fighter when Street Fighter 4 was announced I remember being excited and it was like I've been out of that forever not that I was ever I'm not one of those like fighting game fans.\"",

I can't remember his name in the yellow thing, yeah with the ponytail, yeah whatever the hell his name is, I don't know but that's a good hint, huh? Is it Bob? No, not Bob.

So like they're just like, \"we don't need to,\" we can just make 3D models and flatten them in a 2.5d plane and be fine. And that's what they've done in Street Fighter; they're just making you know beautiful models that look great. And I want the sprite art and stuff too, but it's just... like the pixel art, it's just not going to happen. Like it's so rare. That's why Shovel Knight, which you talked about in the last segment, is so awesome because that is you know, that is pixel art. But it's not practical cuz then you have to animate it, yeah you know.

And they study their moves, and they play; they're a different character, you know. I could do the same opening on a chess board, I can do you know or I can you know do the Sicilian Defense, whatever. And someone might do the same thing, but they'll play it differently from there five moves ahead, the game the board looks totally different. So a player that uses Chun-Li will play the player with a a different complexion than someone else. There's layers upon it's like Inception, there's like layers and layers and layers and layers and layers of fighting game community. I have such a deep and unabiding respect for the way they play.

It's just funny that they've made these games that are on the bubble for both of these genres \u2013 these hardcore genres that vacillate between acceptance and not acceptance or like a game that can be competitive or not competitive when you have the hardcore Gran Turismo or the Street Fighters, but then you have these Nintendo games. It's just funny that they made both of those games, yeah, that sit on the outside kind of, but everyone kind of loves them one foot in the water kind of, yeah, I think it's just an observation very interesting that they've innovated but aren't quite accepted in and at least the fighting game community. The racing game community is a little more... I'm curious what the Evo there's got to be an EVO for racing games right like not not Evo called Evo but there's got to be a racing game like racing games like F1 games, and all those are huge in Western Europe, but thing isn't it broken down by by",

Sure, but we didn't know about EVO well, I mean, EVO's been around for a long time, but EVO didn't, I don't feel like EVO reached mainstream acceptance and coverage until three or four years ago, maybe. So, like, EVO had existed and people liked it, but like EV would never have been on the front page of IGN in 2010. Yeah, I mean, I guess the so... I'm just saying the other side of that though is, I mean, I knew about EVO; how would I have known about EVO? You're a young kid, you're a young whipper snapper; they were telling you, I mean, EVO.
