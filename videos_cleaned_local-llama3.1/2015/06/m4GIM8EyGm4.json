First off, the rigmarole of this whole show, ladies and gentlemen. If you don't know, this is the Kinda Funny Gamescast every week. We talk about video games for about an hour, sometimes a little more than an hour, and then we break it up topic by topic over at YouTube.com/kindafunnygames on Fridays. You can get the full episode, you can get the previous Friday early on Patreon.com/kindafunnygames, and it's really cool. You should do that because this one is worth a dollar. I don't think I've ever said that for Gamescast that it's worth a dollar. Because it's never been worth a dollar. I guess you're right. I won't lie. I thought last week was stellar.

I'm playing in a different way, so I've not gone as far as Greg has because I'm just way more meticulous and OCD about it. So the maps in the game are filled with question marks \u2013 like sometimes 150 of them at a time \u2013 and they're basically just little things you can go find. But I'm just doing all that like I am, leveled twice as high as I should be to where I am in the game. Your quests are level six right? Like my main quest is level six when you do this, and I'm like, no, I'm good; I'm level 12 right now. No, I'm good. And um, and I'm just running around, fighting, and doing things.

They have to make you know uh you know some um some decisions to make the game run better by getting rid of some of these beautiful textures and all these kinds of things. But I think there's something about the world that's very realistic and very lived in that makes me want to keep going back to it, the way the weather interacts with the world, the trees swaying in the wind, the the lived-in nature of the towns and The Villages, the kind of the the dirty nature of like the way people look.",

Like, every time you sleep, he has nightmares of the first time he was in Castle Wolfenstein, and the nightmares are the original game. And then you play the original game - the blocky graphics, oh that's cool. So like, he's having a nightmare of a stage or a place he was in the original Wolfenstein, and it goes back there and it's the original game, and you play it. That's awesome. And then he wakes up.

Yeah, so Nick's been playing a lot of Metal Gear Ground Zeroes and he keeps talking about it - it's like I like seeing him getting into that. Another thing he was just saying, he told us today that he beat Shovel Knight, right?

And one of the things was I I I I was I was just I talked to those guys a lot, and I was just like, \"You know, one of the cool things I hope they do is a robot master style um creation contest.\" Because for Mega Man 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, even 8, or I guess through eight, nine, and 10, they didn't do this; they those all those robots were designed by players.

Let me let me check my tweets. There's a game that was made by ex-Bioshock developers, obviously. Um, you know Irrational Games is no more and those guys got laid off. Irrational Games is Boston-based, so a lot of these guys stayed in Boston and created Perception. Sorry, by Deep End Games - Deep End Games is the news studio - and the game is called Perception.

Um, the audio Jedi asks can a game show too much before it's released? Yes, kind of like movie trailers giving away too much all the time. I think it's with both movies and games, it's happening more and more, yeah. And I think especially for us when we get to play games before and see them before they're finished, it's like... it's so hard to actually get a good experience with games now because it's just do know too much, and not even just seeing even just reading, I feel like even back in the day.",

I mean they've been trying to do this for 25 years, I think. Yeah, eventually absolutely it'll be seamless. Um, whether or not that's a good thing or not, I don't know. I always think there's going to be a... we were talking about The Last of Us, I think some time ago, like the game looks very realistic but there's something not realistic about it. Well, yeah, I don't think that there ever will happen - like I don't think we'll ever see a game that if you watch it you're going to be like 'is this real life?'

I think that as processing power exponentially increases in these computers and stuff like that it's going to require development developers that are able to do this but think about The Last of Us, yeah there's something not real about it but the animation is not the problem with that game to make it not real I think that",
