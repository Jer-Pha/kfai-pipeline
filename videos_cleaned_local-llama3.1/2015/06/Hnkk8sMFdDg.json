Um, there are mutants and humans that are still surviving; their currency are bottle caps from the top of Coke bottles. Um, and this is a guy from the Brotherhood of Steel, um, who are basically one of the factions in the game, neither good nor bad depending on how you treat them. Um, and this is a game much like Mass Effect in other games where your choices matter; when you kill someone in the game, he's dead permanently or she's dead permanently.
