Our resident anime fan here at Kinda Funny, Tim recommends that you watch Attack on Titan; he's right back there watching it right now. And now we go forward henceforth, so let's watch the cutscene. Okay, Ryu Hayabusa, Hayabusa - fun story. You know that one of the fastest production motorcycles on the planet? It's called the Hayabusa. No, I didn't know that. Do you think it was named after Rio? I guarantee it was; I'm sure I don't think it means anything in Japanese. No, truth be told - yeah, I think it's actually an American word. So Ninja Gaiden, which I thought was Ninja Gayden until I was like 20 years old, until you saw the movie where he was like Ninja Gaiden. Well, I saw that and I was like, \"That was ridiculous.\" You're ID, you're not right; I saw you know I saw the movie and and I was like no there's no way but anyway I love this game.",

I used to like to hide up there and then kill that little monkey - it looks like a dog to me, it looks like a monkey, I mean it looks like... a rest as a dog. Why does it have clothes on? You got that fire now. So the one thing that I didn't like about this game when I was a kid was that it was too easy to use the sub weapons because this game controls the same way Castlevania does but it is 7,000 times quicker. Oh yeah, it's fast. So like you just have to play it a different way but it definitely took a lot of inspiration with its sub weapons and all those kinds of things - like you press up and B and you shoot weapons like that. I think it's dope, the boomerang throwing star, yeah it's it's awesome. This is such an extraordinarily special game. What's funny is I bet I could jump back in here.",

That's why I love these cutscenes when I was a kid because they're using that sort of frame to reveal things just like a film does, right? It's cool, very super panoramic anamorphic style, and then we're back in the action. By the way, how much did you want that ninja suit when you were a kid? Oh, I made my mom - I think we talked about this on the Game Over Greggy show briefly - but I was a ninja for Halloween, and my mom made me an awesome ninja suit, and I had a katana here, and like my ninja stars on my belt, and all sorts of cool things like that.
