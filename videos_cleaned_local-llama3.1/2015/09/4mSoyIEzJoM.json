The other day, well, I'm always reading on my phone; I'm not saying that's wrong, but... But there is a but: You can't in the same breath judge other people for being addicted to this because they're not reading an article; they are finding that news somehow else, maybe through Snapchat, maybe someone's talking about something. But it's spite of that now, granted it's not the same thing, and I know that. And I do worry even in myself that those tendencies are so rabid that it actually starts to encroach on my relationship with my wife. She'll actually have to tell me; we'll be in a line at Starbucks, she'll be mid-sentence, and the second I get in line, my brain goes: \"Phone.\" I don't want to be in this situation right now; this is stupid; I'm getting",

Right, and my wife literally says \"speak to your **** manager.\" I actually didn't order coffee; I was actually very pleased with the service. Speak to your manager, and she's like, \"What's wrong?\" And I was like, \"**** manager.\" Um, my wife will tell you; she'll be like, \"Not on my phone,\" just slap it on the ground. I'm a real person, just to me, this is something I'm on the opposite end of. Here's the thing: first off, I'm not a quality human being; I know that. Second off, everything Colin says, I agree with completely \u2013 you should be putting quality stuff out there, and whatever. Third off, I'm the lowest common denominator; I understand that.

There's no room for discussion and there's no room for thought-out things anymore. And there's a need for that stuff in society. But you look around at the tools that are being made - Snapchat's a tool just like any other one, just like a hammer. It's just a digital tool. Everything's going in the exact opposite direction we need it to go into, and everyone's minds are going in the exact opposite direction we need them to go into. To me, that's just problematic. It doesn't mean that it's right or wrong; it doesn't mean that you're bad or good if you use Twitter or Facebook or Instagram or whatever.

And I don't think it picked up just cuz it's it's hard like a lot of people just a lot of people just want to consume this is this is the other big issue I have is there's just so much more information out there than there used to be available to us, so when we were kids it was like yeah you read the entire article cuz there was only five articles in the magazine and that's the only magazine you had yeah access to now when I log on to Twitter I need I feel this like and and I'm always failing at this but I feel this",

Football doesn't matter, I love it, but it doesn't matter. I sit down and watch an entire game from beginning to end, whatever you know, Raiders, Niners, Jets, whatever it is, you know, whatever it's on TV. And he's like, \"Dude, you don't have to do that. Just go to the Red Zone Channel, and it'll be all of the games.\" And when they get into the Red Zone, The Red Zone being 20 yards from the end zone, they'll just switch to that game.
