He says 'game endings that stuck with you the longest, not necessarily the best or your favorites though it would make sense that your favorite endings would also be the most memorable but rather the endings that were most memorable to you.' He has two that we can I'll bring up after I don't want to get in your heads. I had a chance to think about this and I will go first. Thought about it, like his examples are good okay but like the one that the game ending that I think is stuck with me the most was the end of The Walking Dead Season 1 Episode 5, like when that ends. Don't know if we want to spoil stuff, spoiler alert, spoiler alert talking about game endings had your chance Nick's doing the Taps\"",

And then I woke up the next morning, took Porky for a walk, and I had my headphones on and that song came back on right away. That song immediately brought all those feelings back and even now, I was trying to describe it as like there was a thumb print on my soul, you know? Like it was always there with me.

So it just left me feeling lost and confused kind of, and I which and loving that series so much, that's obviously not the way you want to leave it, um. So that was that was like the most heartbreaking game ending for me. Um, for things that I thought were really clever, it's kind of similar to what you just touched on with The Walking Dead, but with Red Dead, and I know we keep talking about Red Dead today, but that's a good game to talk about, that ending shocked me because I wasn't you know, you kind of like ride home after the last mission, this is a weird place for it to end, yeah, and you're like okay well now I've got my family and like we're going to make some eggs or something and we're you know I'll teach my son how to do some stuff we'll go around the farm and I don't",

The first 80 hours before it were awesome with the exception of Mass Effect one which sucked but Mass Effect 2 was really good; three was expanding on that. Sorry, I forgot at this one point.
