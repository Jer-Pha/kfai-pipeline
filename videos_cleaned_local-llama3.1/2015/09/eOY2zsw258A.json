Um, if they released it a couple weeks earlier, I think more people would have played it; it would have sold many more copies probably. But the game uh combines some Batman-like combat, I think dumbed down uh a little bit from Batman. But I think personally, don't feel like Batman; I know people like Batman, that's great. I enjoy playing those games too. I don't find the combat deep at all in those games. A lot of people so this is dumbed down based on what you already said it's not deep. Yeah, okay exactly. Um, you're basically just mashing buttons and I know people are like well you can do this, this, and this and Batman. I'm like well the game doesn't force you to do it; you don't have to do anything, you know? Yeah, if the game wants to be clever, it should force",

I'm not calling anyone in question about that, but the general way I've heard people talk about the game is like I'm a little confused about why people feel a certain way about it. For instance, I've read a lot about how it's like very similar and some of the character models are the same or some of the places you go are the same, and I'm like first of all, I've not really found that, especially with the locations. I think the locations are quite diverse. But even if that's the case, like we love Fallout 3 with its four character models and it's uh, like three interiors um and a world frankly, the Capital Wasteland, frankly much less compelling world than this.

I'm I'm not saying these games are as good as Fallout; I'm saying that those those worlds have held nothing nothing compared to to like the Mad Max World in terms of how dire it is. Um, so yeah, like I think people I think do you think I'm sorry go ahead I was just going to say I think it might be a product of people and this is what I've been predicting for a long time is people are getting tired of open world and I'm kind of getting tired of them too but I think that I I like what this particular World holds for me. Do you think that the reason people are being hard on this one and you're comparing it to Fallout, you're comparing it to Just Cause these different things? Is there anything Mad Max excels at? You're talking about the combat is repetitive, you know, I mean it's it's a d it's even dumbed down versus Batman which you don't like.\"",

Like I don't find that in Max's world. The world's dead and everyone's trying to kill each other. They're eating each other. You know? It's just a decaying totally collapsing world full of sandstorms and awful weather, and things turn on a dime. Now you were talking about the story there is a story and I don't think the story is very important. I don't think the story is very compelling. The one thing I like about the story more than anything else are the little things you call history relics which are pictures and stuff in like notes that you find where it shows the world before decay or while it was decaying and how the world remained normal even when it was decaying until like a turning point happened in which everything kind of fell apart.

Yeah, I mean it's a valid question and I don't necessarily think this game's for everyone. I would like, I feel like a game I really enjoy, like Dying Light, can relate to a lot of people. I feel like even a game like Arkham Knight, which I think is overrated, is still a fun game and I understand why people like it. And I think it's got great presentation value. I think the reason that I think it's not going to get much better than M for Mad Max in this is the same reason why I think you probably couldn't make a very good 9.5 or 10 game on the road, like the Road is my favorite post-apocalyptic anything that's ever been made but it's like really dire and dark and at some point like there's no hope in that world and Mad Max, there's no hope, the whole",

I mean, cuz the immediate way to pin prick that theory would be The Last of Us, but there's hope in The Last of Us. So I'm with you - yeah, exactly. The Last of Us is all about Hope - yeah, in a way it doesn't start out that way, but it starts out with a lot of loss. But I mean The Last of Us becomes all about Hope. Sure. Um, and Hope Solo - Hope Solo, exactly. Um, so like I'm a little conflicted on Mad Max in terms of like I kind of get why people might not... it might not resonate with people.

Um, and then there's so like there's there's just a series of things to unlock - there's like fortresses that you unlock and then you build them up and stuff like that.

Max turns his back and walks away right onto his next adventure you know what I mean it's totally just like I could totally this isn't about him this is just like some side thing that popped up as he was walking and got engaged with it I think as Mad Max has gone on through these films like it's become less about Max, Max is almost like an avatar it's about the world the world is the story the world is the main character the and like so in Fury Road to me that movie was awesome I love that movie I think that movie is extraordinarily good but it has very little dialogue it's it",

And I think that there's like I maybe I'm reading too much into it maybe I'm reading too much into Mad Max generally and always have, but I just feel like there's something about that world that demands some thought. And I think that that is juxtaposed intentionally against its clown-like enemies and its over-the-top car combat and all these things that are very easy to understand. You just have to reconcile those two things, and I think that's the whole idea. It's like these cars, these gangs are dressed like clowns basically, and are just jumping from car to car and killing themselves like they don't care, and that doesn't seem to make any sense with a world that is deep and decaying.",
