It comes from Patreon.com KindaFunny, where Shahar Goldfinger, who we know well, what up Shahar? He uh has been giving us money and he picked this topic. Sure, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best abs. Marvel, Marvel Chris Hemsworth - see now that's where my mind went, but I think he might have the best biceps. I think Chris Evans is spectacular in Captain America. We uh potentially look some of these up for research purposes, of course, of course. Let me think here. Um, who do you want first? You want Chris? Let's well, I'll look up Chris; you look up Chris Hemsworth; I'll look up... I'll look up Chris Evans okay. I like that see cuz I don't remember what I don't remember Evans off Evans had some big ass biceps too yeah but he was he was I mean all these guys don't me wrong jacked is a mofos now here I actually no I'm sorry I take it back Ryan Reynolds has the best abs, but he's not CU - he is he technically no he's",

Ryan Reynolds has the best abs, but he's not in the MCU; he's in the Fox universe, so no. He's sorry, Ryan. Now what I'm challenging you to do with yours by the way is to find him topless ab photos - no, I'm sorry, he needs the ABS, the ABS we need, but I want to see the abs in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I'm seeing a lot of ab photos here; you know what I mean? But I'm seeing only one where it's Thor for sure. Oh, that's Johnny Storm - no, that doesn't work. No, no, see this is for sure from Thor two - or maybe Thor from Thor three. Get that he wins. I'm sorry, find the photos of Evans' abs; just give me Evans' those are pretty good too. I mean, I'd take them both with me. Yeah, but Hemsworth, dude, I mean, Hemsworth is he's got the bubble butt which helps with the ABS - you know what I mean? The bubble butt comes out and just",

No offense to them; no, it's not offense to them; it's they're already established. And I think that in Chris Evans' photos, where it's like you're getting your powers, we need to establish you're a God. And also all these guys - this was like the tip of their career. Like Evans had done a bunch of movies but this made him a mega Star as did it Hemsworth. And Hemsworth has even said he's like I worked out harder for Thor one than anything I've ever done, cuz I'm like this is my shot. And when you see the **** with the shirt off, yeah holy Jesus. I actually I remember I'll never forget this; I was uh with Sean Finn, I think, and he was like you had an audible reaction to the man with the shirt off, like what the ****?
