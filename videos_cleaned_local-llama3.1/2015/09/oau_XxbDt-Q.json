Nick, what's your topic? So we've been traveling a lot right, Greg, yeah, we have. Uh, and if there's been one constant though is that no matter where we go in the world we always come back to good old SFO, which is an airport that I actually particularly care for. I care for SFO because when we fly out of terminal two it's red. Let me stop you for one second here: why isn't people called it San Francisco International every time? I'll tell you why; every airport has its three-letter designator, and some of them are way weirder than that.

LAX, yeah, that's exactly right. It's another thing they have to have - they have to have three, and there's probably some reasons for it. Like I remember when my mom worked for Delta, when she was an executive at a Delta connector, way back in the day, they used to have these really old computers where pilots would go and check the weather, and you could check the weather in any airport by just typing in three-letter codes, and then it would tell you the weather. And they'd just type it in, look, and then go to the airplanes or whatever. Uh, so I used to just sit there and like do every combination I could think of, and you'd come up with some crazy places in the world, like Yellowknife in Canada, or something like that - Yellowknife, yeah, and sounds like some metal.",

Anyway, the point is, is that I learned when I was a kid that none of the none of the symbols make any sense, there are **** whacked out symbols that have literally nothing to do with the the location because the symbols were taken or whatever, just so weird it can't it can't be SFO but SFAI like they literally say when you walk in you hear the goddamn thing welcome to San Francisco International Airport. I'll see if that's taken, it might have been taken maybe, sorry and it wasn't International when it started, I think that's the other thing, oh you know what I mean yeah it was just that makes sense it was just O'Hare is SFAI airport, um anyway so my question is for you guys, you know since I spent a considerable amount of time in the airport and often",
