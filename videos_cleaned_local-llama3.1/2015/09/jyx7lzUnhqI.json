Nobody understands how Snapchat works, but that is how you know how to use Snapchat when you realize this more than anyone else because then you can just say you do, and then everyone believes you. Gotcha! It's this magical trick that people play. See, I'm torn on this whole Snapchat thing because part of me, of course, has a huge ego, and just wants to be big so that I can destroy you all; the other part of me thinks that I've been through that revolution where like all of a sudden people were selling things that weren't necessarily backed up by hard analytics, and it never leads to something good. You know, where like people are making a lot of money on Snapchat right now, right? But there's no way to track that engagement, and so you don't really know as a brand if you're actually doing anything; if that money you're spending is doing anything.",

It's like, doesn't matter, we're charging millions of dollars for it. All right, um... I just worry that a piece of tech like that is out there being monetized because, like Twitter for instance, you can see how many followers you have, there are actual metrics - you can see how many people retweet your stuff, you can see how many people are being driven from Twitter to the various links that you're sending them out to, so you can actually judge social engagement.

Oh, I went to them, the two youth; we need to just hire a bunch of 10-year-olds to run this company, and that's pretty much what's happening. So I talked to all of them - all of the 10-year-olds; I conducted surveys and figured stuff out, and I was like, \"I asked all of them how do you use Snapchat?\" And they all told me, and I took all that information and tried to figure it all out to try to make sense. Of course, everyone uses it differently, but the thing is, they all use it the same in some key ways.

Please let everyone out there know how to use Snapchat because I'm sure a lot of you are questioning it. I've seen a lot of people tweeting at me like \"you cracked Instagram a long time ago,\" you helped Nick understand it exactly. If you want to know how to use Instagram, tweet at Tim Gettys and ask him how to use Instagram; he won't tell any of us, but he might tell you, especially Snapchat. I'm telling you all right now. So the core thing of it is it's a messaging app. You can snap at people, just take a picture \u2013 what a snap is. It's either a video that's up to 10 seconds long or a picture. Both of them have to be vertical, so it's a 16 by 9 aspect ratio. It's 9 by 16; they're getting crazy.

What I like about Snapchat is you don't need to put as much thought into it as the Instagram post or the Twitter post. It's not supposed to be clever. I like to try to make them clever every once in a while cuz I'm that type of guy, yeah. But it's just kind of like watching things happen. So earlier today Greg was asleep on the floor, yeah. Snapchatters call it Snapchat, I don't know about that. The 10-year-olds haven't told me that they haven't told me Snapchatting this right now, this is what's happening, this is being snapchatted.

You send I screen cap that yes and if I tweet that out people can just they screen cap it what do they do they'll just if they uh download the picture or whatever or screen cap it you can just add there's a thing that says add by QR code or whatever and you can just it automatically add you just Tim Gettys is that what you are yes kind of funny vids has a score three. What does that mean? So the score, that's where things get really interesting, it you said it's gotten really interesting four times or something.

So, that's dumb; that number's dumb. What Kevin's got is something - Kevin's chiming in. Kind of funny vids, you're stupid, just letting you know it's officially stupid. Kevin is stupid, but um, now there's another level to this, which is my personal favorite thing about Snapchat, and what I actually have been using the app a lot to engage with myself in terms of content that I like. There's this thing called the Discover tab - the Discover tab is a bunch of brands; there's only like 12 brands at a time, and they're always like the top brands in whatever given sector they're in. So BuzzFeed, ESPN's one of them, Cosmo Magazine's one of them, and every day there's 10 new snaps that you can",

I was just reading about them because I want to know more about them as a company, and it's huge, it's it's huge. I mean their numbers are huge, they make no money, they have which is every **** company in Silicon Valley, they have through series C funding so they've gotten funding like four times at this point, uh, rounds of funding, so they have money doesn't seem like they're making any profit, uh it doesn't seem like",

So you might want to tweet, and what makes Snapchat different is that just like all of them suck every social media sucks unless you make it good.

It feels like Snapchat is like a step away or two steps away from evolving to a form that's like awesome for everybody, and that's what I see when you're talking about like the Discover tab will one day be for everybody and stuff like that - it's like that's exciting.
