Hey guys, I was wanting to know which superhero games do you prefer: the Infamous series or the Batman Arkham series, and why? And do you think Sucker Punch will make another Infamous game, and do you think there'll be more Arkham games? Wow, lots of questions! Question, I like it. It's in my wheelhouse, as they say. I mean, knee-jerk reaction, first blush: question. I'm going to say Infamous. I like those games more, and I love Batman, you know this. I obviously loved the hell out of every other Batman game there was. It's just that Infamous... I don't know. I like building something on your own, you know what I mean? I'm specifically talking about one and two, by the way. Like Second Son was fine; really good gameplay. Nobody does the scaling up a building, running off, shooting powers.\"",

Infamous shooting up poles doing all this stuff climbing up walls just the fact you can scale any wall you see but like for me at least in the Infamous one and two, I don't know how you feel, combat always came down to this and then just like side sliding around people and trying to shoot them in the head. Whereas Batman - yeah it's uh what you call repetitive or I'm sorry I lost my train of thought, Batman is the same thing over and over again right but it is that uh I I feel like **** Batman when I do it, you know what I mean, I feel powerful, I feel like a superhero.

Like, I don't like when you encounter enemies and it's like, \"All right, now we're gonna fight these enemies.\" Here, it's like, what I love about Infamous was that I didn't have to fight these guys at all, and I could just drag these two groups together and blow them all up, you know? Do whatever. Like, I felt like there was a lot of agency in the way you fought in Infamous, and also Infamous had uh two different ways to play the game - really, like, you're good or you're bad, and you get different powers and different stories. So I think it was surprising that they didn't do more with Second Son. I think the game's very pretty, um, and it runs well, and especially the neon power.",

It was like neon video and concrete and stuff like that. Like I liked that. That was smoke and smoke. I thought it was interesting. It's not like ice and fire like they used before. It's like things that you would never think of. I thought that was really, really nifty. But um the one thing I'd love to see is when we're talking about comparing these two things, Infamous didn't get in one and two, and I really thought they were going to get it in Second Son, and didn't. Batman: Arkham series nails it all together and making it feel natural like for Infamous one and two when they were basically like open world superhero games, they were kind of like making it their own right",

This time in Second Son, they did it again and I was like oh all right this is supposed to be Seattle, it's a super beautiful city, it looks photorealistic, why would there still be this thing pointing down? Whereas in the Batman series, you shoot up the side of the building and BAM! The Riddler appears in your face, where you're going and you hear the opera music and you have to go find that and then swinging around the way it's all one world, it didn't feel like segmented parts that were pasted onto the world.

It's just like punch, punch, punch, punch this guy has a shield, punch, punch, jump, punch this guy has you know a lightning thing hit him with your you know your quick attack and then punch him. Like it's just the same thing over and over again. I was just like there's something about the look of it though, like just watching the combat of Batman, even if both games really just come down to combat in games usually like those types of third-person games are pretty repetitive and just like there's a bunch of guys doing the same move that affects them the most you know.

There's always like the camera's a little bit different, the way he does it, like just transitioning between the enemies and stuff... it looks so fluid. Whereas an Infamous game, like doing the just the combat, it looks like a Stilted animation that like reminds you this is a video game, yeah? But and I I don't necessarily disagree with you, but I will remind you that Infamous combat isn't predicated by its aesthetic right - like the reason you could just keep hitting the square button and you're just going to jump from any enemy it's just going to happen automatically in Batman... like if you kill an enemy in Infamous he's dead and you can keep shooting in that direction, but it's not going to like automatically point to the next enemy.

If that enemy was an Infamous one, you would be able to kill him in 10 different ways, you know? Like, and that's what I think is so... I just look at it through that lens where I just don't feel like there's a lot of choice in Batman. I don't think it's the fun part about Arkham Knight to me was the story and the characters; they did a really great job of putting that City together, and I thought it was fun to kind of traverse and I always kind of dreaded the combat, I was just like yeah, I liked the combat in In The Same Spirit as Arkham Asylum where I'm sneaking around...",

So I I I like the strategic element once the element of surprise is lost, like it's just like Jesus Christ you know, like uh it's Batman hey Batman, yeah, and they're looking around but I thought Batman over here, but I did there were cool elements in the game with in Arkham Knight which I don't think is in the other Batman games which was like you can disable their guns, you can disable their healing packs, you can disable like all these things like using your special weapons and stuff so I thought that was cool.

No, uh, the they are if Shuhei Yoshida told us at E3 on our live show that he had already played a portion of their next game, which indicates to me that they had been working on this game for a while before Second Son probably even came out, and that it's not an Infamous game. Um, because there's just no way a studio... you know I was there that studio is big, I mean it's a big Studio, but when I was there right before InFamous: Second Son came out, it looked like all hands were on deck for Second Son, but it seems like they were working on something else the entire time. Um, so my assumption is based on their pedigree, it'll be a similar game, third-person open-world just like Sly, just like Infamous, but it'll be something else. Yeah, and what about Arkham? Arkham is a big question right um I I they didn't... my whole prediction leading up, I guess spoilers for Batman: Arkham Knight not really on a thing that didn't even happen so whatever um you know I predicted forever",

However, a million references to Superman - phone calls from Lex Luthor, Daily Planet things, Keystone City things. I mean, there's like they're making references to \"hey guess what,\" there is the DC Universe here, this is happening. And so, I still think a Justice League game isn't out of the question in terms of like the next game is, and this - I won't spoil it - but I think the game, the way Batman: Arkham Knight ends could leave itself open to a Justice League game of like all right cool now we all come together to do this one thing and figure out what's happening.
