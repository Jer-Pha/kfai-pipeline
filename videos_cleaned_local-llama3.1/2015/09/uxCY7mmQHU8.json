How much did you spend on clothes this weekend? $500 - that's awesome. Because you used to say, \"Tell me ahead of time.\" I think when we first moved in, you'd like it every year and a half, like two years, you actually go out and spend a ton of money on lots of money, way more than $500.

Gotcha! It's this magical trick that people play. See, I'm torn on this whole Snapchat thing because part of me, of course, has a huge ego and just wants to be big so that I can destroy you all; the other part of me thinks that I've been through that revolution where like all of a sudden people were selling things that weren't necessarily backed up by hard analytics, and it never leads to something good. You know, where like people are making a lot of money on Snapchat right now, right?

If you want to know how to use Instagram, tweet at Tim Gettys and ask him how to use Instagram. He won't tell any of us, but he might tell you - especially Snapchat. I'm telling you all right now. So the core thing of it is it's a messaging app. You can snap people just take a picture. What a snap is, it's either it's a video that's up to 10 seconds long or a picture. Both of them they have to be vertical so it's a you know 16x9 aspect ratio - it's 9 by 16.

Where like they're playing an app, they're playing a game on their on their phone, that's just a waste of time right? It's the entertainment value of it now people I think have transitioned over to Snapchat. This isn't necessarily where they're getting their news from; it's just fun, it's just a distraction while I'm waiting in line at Starbucks and that's that's the scarier thing for me is thing for me is I feel like I have enough of the distractions yeah but you are also a a 35-year-old man sure very true um I'm ingrained with Twitter I like Instagram fine you like yeah you like you like all those things you like to be able to to message this is a very from what I can glean kind of more of a passive experience where you're just kind of following people it's similar to Facebook",
