I just want to be around her more.

So this gives me so much anxiety. I'm not supposed to be scared of this. I don't understand. Um so yeah it was it was fascinating watching that happen. And then of course my brother got into college and joined a fraternity and it was like holy crap I thought you were dangerous in high school but now there's a whole other like bigger playing field for you. Um, so I got a little bit of that, but it also it actually um pushed me the opposite way because watching him kind of explore that side of him made me go more toward the romance side.

And so it became very hard for me to like I was always the funny guy that was like, \"Oh, Nick's so funny. You're such a good friend.\" And I was like, \"Fuck, how do I get out of this position?\" And I was like, \"I got to lose weight.\" And it took me forever to do that.
