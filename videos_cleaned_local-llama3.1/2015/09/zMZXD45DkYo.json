But the side op for the 15th time, that's what I'm like. Tell me about Afghanistan, yeah, what's going on in the world? It updated, but what I don't like about it is you don't see their faces, like with the codec, so and a lot of the voices in this game, I'm like, you all sound exactly the same, yeah, a lot of it, yeah. Just a lot of the tapes, I'm like, yeah, I don't know who's talking. And Snake as well; it's like when he doesn't talk, he doesn't talk enough for me to like identify with The Voice at all.

And I was like it's not a right or wrong kind of answer because I think that it's a case-by-case kind of basis. I think there are some things that you obviously shouldn't jump into without having experienced other things first, and there are some things that you could do that and this might be a game for that. But it still strikes me as weird and inauthentic being either excited or wanting to play Metal Gear Solid 5 when I'm not even sure what happened in 3 at all, and then in 4, I have no idea what happened or how it ended, and I never played those games, yeah.

If you sit down to play it, I think it's a different story. I think you could finish a game that's the fifth installment, the third installment for the first time, and then now I'm a fan of this franchise, this world. And I think that games, especially nowadays, they're designed to bring new audiences in playing the different Metal Gear games just from a gameplay perspective it's like this franchise specifically story-wise are you gonna be lost as hell?

I feel like the gameplay is plot-driven info yeah exactly not more so than any of the other percent in Metal Gear Solid 5 is the continuation of all the criticism from that whereas I always said Peace Walker was a great standalone story, you can draw in all you need to know is that you're the super-soldier, you killed your mentor, you were kind of in love with her there's a lot of questions oh my god there's a tape with her voice on it recorded last week.",

You wake up, and the prologue is meant to be completely disorienting, even if you have played this game, you don't know exactly what's happening. It's scary, it's frightening - you're terrified of what's happening - and then you get the little recap after that. If like we're on the story, and you go... And the hook to this game is the gameplay. It's not like Metal Gear 2 where I was like, if you weren't a fan, you're even more lost than usual. And who is Solidus, and what really happened?
