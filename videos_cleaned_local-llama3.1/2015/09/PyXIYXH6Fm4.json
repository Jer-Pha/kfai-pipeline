Be no spoilers here; we're going to be fine, calm down internet. Yeah, I mean there'll be as many spoilers as there are when we talk about anything. Sure, yeah. Which is, I say, let me tell you the ending. Yes, go for it. No, so I'm so excited about this game. I've been excited about this game forever right, and I'd say in the last month or two I got really excited about this game as you started hearing more and more about being able to go play and all that stuff like... I want to do this. Yeah, and I have so many questions now. Sure, you've played it; you've beaten it. Yes, so okay, I've beaten it. I've beaten the main story.

I've gotten the ending; my questions are answered as to what's happening in this game, okay? And you were satisfied? Yeah, I mean, I don't think the story...like that was the weird thing I keep talking about with this right is the fact that Ground Zeroes didn't work for me because I didn't like being dropped into...what I always thought called The Shoe Box where you got dropped in and there was a...\"",

And so when I went and got to play that preview of The Phantom Pain, that was when I was like \"oh man\" - the mechanics work and are amazing in an open world where you can run and do this or take a problem from any angle you want right because in Ground Zeroes it felt like well **** I have to go this way because there's a guy there and a guy there or whatever, whereas this one had people on patrol and they move out and they're having conversations; you could move around a bit more freely.

Like there's all these hooks built in where I'm like I'll go get that. Well, I got that, and I did scan, and that guy's an A+ in combat, and I'm really having trouble right now in combat Ops getting my guys that I send out to get more GMP or to get more resources or to get A+ guys, but they have a chance of losing. But if I bring them in, I put them in my team, going to be stronger, I'll have a better chance, so I'm going to take them out. Well, now I'm close, and I'm pretty sure I haven't cleared this Outpost, and if I clear this Outpost, I'm going to get more heroism that'll maybe",

And once I get the R&D team up, that's one of my big problems right now, right? Like my R&D team, I have as many as I can have, so I have to like find better R&D people and then get rid of the old R&D people or expand it and bring in just more R&D. You know what I mean? Like there's all these little things and it's like I'm right there on so many things and I'm not even right there probably another 10.

And so once you do it on any of the playthroughs, right, that box is checked, you don't have to worry about it. So even on the tough ones, like taking out this boss in quotes, without and only doing it this way, like you can do it, and just focus on that, you don't have to try to do them all in one perfect run or whatever, and you don't have to ask for rank for that, you just have it's like yeah great, there's all these little mini challenges.
