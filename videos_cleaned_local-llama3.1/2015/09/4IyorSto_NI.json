You like the Fear of Walking Dead? So faring it so far? Have you watched any of it? Anybody? Anybody? I haven't gotten a chance. I'm caught up on the other show, on the regular Walking Dead. Oh, sure, sure, sure. Yeah, big Walking Dead fan as you know there best friends. I'm enjoying Fear of The Walking Dead and I enjoy it most because it's all at the beginning and it's all happening and we just see Society start to crumble down and stuff and that's always my most my favorite part of a zombie apocalypse movie and they always get through too quickly, I feel like. Well, yeah, generally in all the movies it's like the first five minutes, it's like the mall for like years. Dawn of the Dead, the remake. God, that opening was so great, that lead up to and then like the Johnny Cash song \"Behind\" like the Montage of everything going to hell you're like",

Walking Dead kind of zombies, we eventually win. We eventually, we're going to win. I don't think we lose to these. It's the ones that run non-stop and never take a breath, then we're **** it's over. Just shoot yourself as soon as it happens. But with the slow ones, we can outthink them. Eventually, in real-world terms, they would rot and just be done and not be able to move, and their muscle tissue would deteriorate and stuff like that. But again, we stab them in the head, they're done. With whatever blah blah. And without spoiling things, some versions of this story are currently playing out where we've got the upper hand, societies are coming back or whatnot. My question is: if zombie apocalypse happens one day, do you think we beat it? And two, what is life like after that? How do we do you?",

What how do we do you think we'd beat it? No, do you think you subscribe to my plan that we would eventually win and then what is life like after that? I think we would 'cause I think you're right. It's like you know, you get through that the bit where everyone hates each other, humans don't trust each other, and all that stuff. But then you do end up getting the groups that are loyal to each other and kind of create a new society, and that society is trained to take care and handle the situation. And then it just becomes part of life, right? So it's just like in the same way that we go to Starbucks every day now instead of doing that. Well, probably in addition to doing that, we would just have to kill a couple zombies but we know how to do that. You know, just become what regimen makes it so the one thing",

But I do feel like, like, and this is a very bad analogy or thing to draw from, but stick with me all right. Like 9/11 happens, and and I'm saying this because this is the biggest thing in my lifetime on American soil where something horrible happens, and people banded together. It wasn't looting and rioting and this like New York's all up right, and it was \"Let's help each other out; let's go and rush the problem.\" Like I'm granted the people who rush the problem on this in the zombie part die or whatever, but I still think there would be more of an us versus them mentality. Is there going to be a governor or a Negan or whatever that rises up? Of course, there's going to be those... it's going to be G",

And then when you get to the point where even, and I'm talking years later, year later, years later, when it's we've beaten it to the point of like, all right, we got to handle on this problem. I think that's when you can start instituting Law and Order again in some way. Yeah, well, I also think that it has to do with the generational thing too, right? Like Carl, in The Walking Dead, Carl's generation is going to be the most screwed up. They're the ones that don't remember it really ever being normal. But then the kids that 10 years later were born, like what's the baby, what's his little baby Judith?
