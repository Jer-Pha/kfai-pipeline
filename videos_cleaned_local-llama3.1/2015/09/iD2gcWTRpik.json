Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare, 10 out of 10, ign.com, you reviewed that, that's a good one, that's a good point, that's a perfect one. And Nick, what do you feel about this? How do I feel about the perfect DLC? What is the perfect DLC for you? No DLC really, I don't want it, I don't, I don't, I once I'm done like I finished Arkham, I saw the 1989 Bat suit, I saw the Batmobile from the from the Tim Burton movie, I was like that looks cool. Why would you give them the $4 or whatever they I'm already done with the game, I beat the game, for you don't get it, I think as into like I don't get this way about every game, there are those spe like Witcher super excited about those expansion packs, I know nothing about, I'm this is piggybacking this, I'm bringing this topic up because of just as why I'm putting it into our popular mindset right now uh today the whole Dragon Age Inquisition thing, the DLC Anakai was 2 years later so they wrote",

I was saying in the Twitch chat that I was hoping it would be a therapy session between Elena and Drake; they just be happy every time this couple is together in these games something horrible happens. Can they just be happy together? Can we open up, and they're happy? Nick, you don't lie to each other. I don't lie to my wife about anything; it scares her. My wife has this new thing; she's like, \"Do I need to be worried about this?\" I'm like, \"No, no, cuz I'll let her know if she has to be worried about anything ever.\" What have you told her about before? Like when we get ready to quit, getting quitting going, signing people's BR is a perfect example of them. And she was like, \"Do I need to be\"",

And real quick what's your Guild Wars game clock at 1100 hours holy **** holy **** how many hours are in a year can someone tell us in the comments?

Help me move!\" I'm like, \"No, I don't want to help you move. I've got these zombies, man! Like no man, some guys give a gun... s a gun.\" Uh, I mean, I haven't played The Witcher, so I don't know, but I mean it was the same for me - it's the same with Dark Souls, where it's like when you're in Arkham City and you're just going around killing everyone.

Put new trophies in, but it's all multiplayer.\" I'm just like, that's not what I care about. Batman did it; they used to do it with character maps, and they still do, but then they did Batgirl this time around, that and when they said that, that's when I was like, \"Here's my season pass; I'll buy the season pass up front.\" I want that plus you're talking about more character-driven pieces later on, but I wonder sales numbers on that though. I just I wonder if they choose... I mean, first off, they're trying to push the multiplayer because that's what typically people will continue to play - what gets people going, keeps them coming back for the experience right exactly versus a story experience that is finite; it has an end but the multiplayer technically",

That's why you know you get excited when you look at it and like talk about even I think that's one of the reasons I like episodic gaming so much, like Telltale stuff, because I get to digest it, think about it, move on, and then here it is again. And like sometimes it works against them - I would have bought Game of Thrones as one; I would have given them $60 right. But I played episode one, and then episode two came, like I don't want to play this, you know what I mean? Like I figured out that it wasn't for me, and at that point, you lose it.

Same thing with Undead Nightmare, um, Red Dead.

But do you see what I'm saying, like have them being like \"Oh, we did this TV show and everybody hated the X, Y, and Z about right?\" So now when we go pitch this other project, we'll fix those things, like no, yeah. Which you get a lot of times. Well, I always say it might be the same in games too - what you get a lot of times in TV and film is that you get like The Big Bang Theory, and then everyone wants to make a Big Bang Theory right?
