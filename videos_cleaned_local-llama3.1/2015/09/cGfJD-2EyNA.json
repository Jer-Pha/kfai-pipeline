Got Sean Finnigan over there with the pistol. The pistol. He's so funny; he thinks he has a chance; he doesn't. Oh my God! All right, so we're out there wanting that sniper drop again. That'd be nice. That's all you need. Hang out this guy, cuz once you got the snipe, it's all over. Oh, I like that side step. The Protector. You know what I mean? Mhm.
