I'm good, how are you good? Uh, you haven't been home in a long time, and then I went to P but while you were gone, I got Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain. Yes, I knew, and I played the balls off of it. I know I was glad that I was gone for Jesus right off of this thing, and so now you're here, and I've tried for a while while we were at PAX, I didn't bring the game, so it actually doesn't work. I thought we'd actually go through and play it right now, you could see why it's amazing, and then you'd understand why you have to play as well. Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves all right? Well okay, as you see right here, see if I even cuz I watched you play uh Ground Zeroes MH, but you were do you were just screwing around in it, so I kept being like this doesn't sound fun at all, like what you were doing when you were just goofing around cuz.",

I want to look at the Fox, that you keep putting a menu up over his face. Look at him; oh, dog, yeah, it's not a dog, but no, his name's D-D-G, and see in the thing he's my he's my diamond dog. I, I, my God, he's so cute, baby. Wait till you see him as a puppy; that's when it really... I'm sure you saw the Fox puppy? Well, no, okay, so here's why: look, Fox, cuz I once you you get to a certain point, oh, by the way, by the way, everybody watching these videos, sorry, this is me 62 hours into the game.
