I think he's often the smartest person in the room, and people who deny that don't really know what they're talking about. I don't think you can dismiss his massive fortune of over $10 billion.

He's always winning, yeah, like he came in everyone like oh ha ha, it's a joke, like he's pulling higher than everyone and now he's just torn away and he's saying some outrageously radical stuff most of which uh I mean I got I got to disagree with a lot of it um but the one thing that I do really respect and appreciate him for is that he is not",

And I was like, everything about him doesn't make sense from a political science perspective, which is why it's so exciting for someone who studied it - where it's like these things are predictable: polling and preelection testing and all this kind of stuff.

And what I think is so, what's happening here is clearly not the Bradley effect but it's something similar and it's reversed. I think Donald Trump has more support than the polls show and I think that people are afraid to admit it like when a pollster calls them or they're afraid to admit it to a friend. I think I think this is what the statistics show with him which is I think is fascinating and this is this is when I saw this I was like this is insane he's winning with Libertarians, evangelical, paleoconservatives, neoconservatives, he's winning with men, he's winning with",

He needs to listen to people that know what they're doing because he doesn't know how to run a campaign. Imagine how effective he could be if he had people that he could... if he had his own. See there in there lies the problem, there in lies the the the issue is because to do that would take away that transparency which I believe people are vibing with, people are responding to that full transpar. He basically was like I'm gaming the system, I'm doing something that no if everyone else did our economy would collapse but I am doing it, I am taking advantage of that because it's a smart business that I'm sharing this I this with you guys I'm being honest if you",

You do, but you don't have to make them like a public figure either. Like he just... I just I can tell when he walks around, he doesn't he's not listening to anyone. I think he has anyone. I think like I think his his opponents backstage have like 40 handlers and then it's to the Trump table and it's like you know a Fanta and maybe a line of cocaine and he's just like let's go after this. You know, I'm not I'm not accusing Greg from... He will sue me, please don't.
