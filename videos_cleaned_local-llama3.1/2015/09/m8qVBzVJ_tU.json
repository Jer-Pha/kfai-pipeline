So you were playing maybe 15 minutes before this section here. What do you feel so far? Uh, just it looks good, plays well so far, still getting used to like dashing left and right things like that. Mm-hmm. But it's Halo. I just tossed away a new gun, but that's fine. So I've always been a big fan of the Halo campaigns as you know me and you have a very storied history when it comes to the Halo franchise playing Co-op throughout all the different campaign modes in Halo one, Halo 2 through all that stuff. Mm-hmm. Um, immediately looking at this, you got the teams right there's the blue team with you, you got Linda the sniper, yep, you got all these different characters. How is that affecting the gameplay? Um, so far I mean if I go down they revive me, so that's that's new okay but I have a fire team they're not really firing at things.",

I'm not going to spoil anything, I just want to charge that grunt. Certain music started playing and you turned back at me and you just give me the biggest smile.
