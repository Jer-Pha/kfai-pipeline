Now you're G like an we need a whiteboard behind you and a marker. Grindcraft explains life, but the reason they like it is it's because that's as edgy as they can get. The pumpkin spice is the most extreme, the most out of the basicness. It's like, oh I'm going to do something wild today, I'm a pumpkin spice latte, not just a mocha. Rapino, so your theory we'll call it yes, is that they live the normal life six out of the seven days a week until and then it comes to like until the fall and then it's Friday night and it's just like you know let's take the pants off, let's make the babies put the leggings on.",

It was just a liquid that sounds like something Kevin would like. This sounds awesome, and they didn't give it to you in very big cups; it was like, you know, your entire year's worth of sugar that you needed in one small cup. My wife and I used to get one once, and I couldn't finish this thing; it was too sweet because it was pure sugar.
