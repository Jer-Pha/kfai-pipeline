So, free dance. You get to jump in here. Uh, I want... Here are the things you need to know ahead of time, yes. Number one, I've never played on the PS4 controller before. I've only played on a Vita, so I'm going to start with a normal one to get in the flow of it. Okay, then I'll go hard and show you how hard it is. I don't have the hardest difficulty unlocked yet; I have beaten the story for the record. Now, I'm starting my way but this is my travel game, so I don't want to rush it. You know what I mean? I got Metal Gear to play here. So, here's my thing: the reason I'm excited about this is that I love rhythm games - oh yeah, love love love them - and I love Japanese pop music. Okay, so this is like right up your alley. This definitely you get to pick Kanji's outfit for this one. Okay, cool. So, you get this one, that one.\"",

It's not Amplitude or uh, I mean DDR even kind of DDR. The DDR all the crazy stuff in the background wasn't so much in the way yeah. The background does take a while to ignore. Damn, I'm getting now.

I have nothing against this game; this is cool, this is fun. Yeah, no. So my issues are and this is an issue across all Dan all Rhythm games. My first time playing, I like to go on hard sure, I like to start off to see if I can do it off the top you know just top the back at the reason I do that is I find it's actually easier to play Rhythm games on harder difficulties cuz there's more stuff right more stuff that actually makes sense.
