Here's what's interesting, and um, I really do think that this it was less uh them fixing the game and tweaking stuff and it was more just the situation in which we were playing uh like I think the TVs just weren't properly calibrated there was lag there was there was stuff because all the people we knew Alfredo and just other people that we knew over like hey does this feel a little weird to you he's like yeah I yeah not in game mode or something maybe I mean that's kind of what it looked like watching him cuz I was like shocked at watching Alfredo and he wasn't just destroying cuz I've seen him even just playing campaign I was just like I my aim is what is happening right now yeah so it was interesting to see that that be a little bit off but I think it was just a little",

And then despite the TV and excuses \u2013 because we're all making excuses right now \u2013 I really think it was you've been playing Destiny; you've been playing all these other first-person shooters for the last year. When's the last time you played Halo? Nice, been forever, right? Yeah, for sure. Like Master Chief Collection last year, and that was like a false start, like you know what I mean \u2013 where you go over to your friend's house, you have your monitor, I play on you know what I mean, and it's like you go to your friend's house; they have this big TV all the time. It's like you kind of have to adjust to it. That's the same thing, you know what I mean.

You are like the elite of the elite when it comes to first-person shooters. You play them all for hours and hours and hours, so you know the differences. So it's funny that I think that stuff affects you more than it would affect most people. Oh yeah, yeah, Greg and I were sitting there messing with our sensitivity for like hours trying to make sure figure that it was right. But the cool thing was it was Halo, and I I think that just from from watching a lot of it and from watching you play, I thought that it was impressive to see Halo finally next-gen because this is the first next-gen or whatever this gen Halo game.

And you know, and like I watched you and my other friends replay that through normal, heroic, legendary, and then legendary again and again and again, and the co-op, and like the Halo campaign and Co-op, and the difficulties - it's kind of unlike any other first-person shooter that I know of. Like, that's an experience people love, and they that is one of the key things that they they're going into these Halo games for. It's not just the the multiplayer; yeah, no, I'm hardcore MP, but like when I get Halo, I'm like, \"I got to get through that story first,\" like first things first.

And what was cool is I remember in Halo 2 playing be like maybe I don't know, oh it was Kraken, yeah, yeah, it was Kraken being like \"Oh my God,\" this is such a grand scale thing and like holy ****. And then I remember in Halo 3 you fight it, like there's a boss fight with that thing, and it's like that's **** cool.

Like I don't know, like there's there's with the Halo Community, there's always this this thing where it's like I want my like I want Halo 2 multiplayer, like just give me that; like you have the Master Chief collection for that, it works now finally. But um, no, I mean like the the new next-gen like version of of Halo is is is very interesting, it's very fast-paced, I think it's good. Sprint or what was it called? Yeah, there's Sprint, like you can you can Dash left and right now too, and and you're you're mantling on top of everything.

Um, so yeah, no Halo 5 MP very fast-paced and it's just it's MP at its core, like I said, this is Halo core. The guns, like the BR shoots, like the BR weapons seem very balanced. There's a new mode that I mean a lot of people know about called Breakout, which is kind of like just 4v4 elimination. You kind of have that like CS, like Counter-Strike type of feel to it. Did you get to play that? Yeah, was it as good as it sounds? Yeah, I played yeah but played a bunch of times, it's very intense.

Is it me or do people not really seem to care about this game compared to the other Halo games? Because like I, I'm not involved in that community, but just working at IGN all those years when a Halo game was coming out, it was an event, and it was a big deal, and people were really, really excited about it. And I've noticed almost a lot of diminishing returns with this series since 343 took it over, where there doesn't seem to be this palpable excitement about this franchise anymore.

I don't see Halo as being something that's as big of a spectacle as it was before.

And I think that the the core audience, like the the the really big Halo fans, just aren't excited because it's just a weird thing. They're very much like sprinting, dashing, like this isn't Halo.
