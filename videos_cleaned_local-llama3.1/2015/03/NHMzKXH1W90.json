Is it just going to be like it was last year with the order where that when that got pushed and everybody's like well okay, yeah there's something we don't know about yet about what they there must be there must be a fall game like there has to be like from one of these studios.

Um, but no, I think... I think that Halo 5, if done right, if it works, will we'll bring it and we'll usher in a new group of people, a new group of players. So I feel like yeah, it's important for the franchise. Mhm. And more importantly, does it look good to you? Yeah, I think it looks good. It plays well. Um, yeah, I played two versions of it - the first version was a little weird and wonky, but uh immediately when that open Beta thing came out, like it played very very well.

I opened it up and it was a 5.5 out of 10. There's no way. And I... I just, I didn't believe this. There I just don't believe it. I remember I got home and I played, I think in one sitting, I played through about half of it. It's not bad, it's not that bad. Those guys... and then the next day I was thinking about it, I'm like, \"Man, DMC one is so good.\" This this isn't bad. This really isn't. And then I beat it, I'm like, \"Wow, this really isn't.\" And it just broke my heart. I remember Brute Force was another one... oh yeah, we were pretty excited about that. Yeah, we were very excited about Brute Force multiplayer, like the co-op and everything about that right? The characters... and that was just a total fail. Yeah, that was just bad.",

Oh, we're like good Lord, I wanted that game so bad; you hadn't known, yeah, you really hadn't known. No, it's just like I didn't...I mean the trailers looked great, everything about it, I'm like this is...I like this, I don't like Final Fantasy IX, I don't like the old like weird stuff, like I like this, the weird stuff, yeah, yeah, the weird stuff is everything after X, that's the weird stuff, but yeah, I don't know, it just hurt, it hurt real bad. Another one, Spider-Man 3; remember how good Spider-Man 2 was, like, just the web-slinging, you like, oh man, if they just made it look prettier, gave you more side missions, this would be great, and it was so bad, yeah, uh, Perfect Dark Zero for Xbox, I was going to say the original, yeah.",
