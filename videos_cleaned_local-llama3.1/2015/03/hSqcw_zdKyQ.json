Yeah, you played it though, right? I played it, and it's what I thought it was. It's an awesome game, but it's just an awesome game that would entertain me for like three weeks. I mean, did you... did you get really into Left 4 Dead? Uh, I got really into Left 4 Dead. Evolve is awesome, but it's it has the same issue that like Splinter Cell multiplayer always has where it's awesome with a group of friends. Like, you really... you really have to have like you and your buddies being the Hunter otherwise it's like it's just not fun. Mhm, yeah.

Um, doesn't eat your **** why is Helldiver eating your **** cuz it's broken? Uh, citizens of Earth came out this year, which is pretty interesting. Um, Ironclad tactics was interesting like there were small yeah Starships came out there's there's smaller games and Starships I wouldn't really call a small game but there are smaller games that have come out that I think are filling in the kind of the crevices nicely but I still think Dying Light was the champion of Q1 by far and I think that um I'm trying to think to make sure I'm not like overstating it yeah \"H1Z1\" is out but I think Dying Light might be my game of the year so far",

This is why I don't even read preview coverage, and why I hated writing previews at IGN, was because when I knew I was interested in a game, I like pre-previews, but the preview beats like my least favorite thing if I could like have never written previews, I would have been totally glad to do that. Because when I'm interested in the game, I don't like to read about it or know much about it, and Dying Light was one of those games that I knew so little about that I didn't even know I would care about it, and I've said before when Greg described it as Mirror's Edge, which I didn't like that much, to like Dead Island meets Mirror's Edge, I was like that sounds awful, you know, and uh, and I played it, I'm like this is great.",

I mean, that's a weird game to get at a weird time. Gear in September, yeah, middle gear in September. We're getting big games at you know, at weird times. Mad Max, Battlefield in March was weird, yeah. Battlefield is out, yeah. Forgot about that. So how's that going? Um, it's like Battlefield 4 but a lot more fast-paced, which I appreciate.
