I, I can't begin to tell you I love this game. And one of the things there aren't many people talk about this game. I think a lot of people really know about it. No, I've never heard of it before. But one of the one of the people that loves this game too was someone we used to work with at IGN, Mitch Dire, and he was one of the only other people I've ever met who's like has... doesn't like ActRaiser but has a passion for ActRaiser really. Yeah, because they made a sequel so years later, Quintet released ActRaser 2: The Legend of Actraiser, and for some reason it's just this... they like got rid of all the SimCity elements, like the city-building elements.

Our first duty is to protect our monsters, our people from any monsters. I will do as you instruct, please raid the land of these monsters with my arrows. So now we're controlling the angel as a proxy okay. And the game had the game is surprisingly deep for when it came out especially I think on Console because we're going to have to start building houses and Roads get rid of some instructions all the while dealing with monsters that spawn everywhere and we have to send our guys to seal various monster layers because there's some remnants of the monsters.
