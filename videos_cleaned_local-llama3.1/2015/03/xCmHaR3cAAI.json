Okay, you can also eat the bad guys and then they're not as hard to hit. I think AB you have your Yoshi right? Right, and now you can shoot them on top of that, no, and then you eat more to make more eggs. This level is called \"Make Eggs, Throw Eggs,\" and then there's just things in the sky exactly. This game has a universal message, it really does so there's always like interactive elements and stuff. The thing that I like the most about this game is the level design, okay, and the art style - the art style is all it looks like a coloring book, yeah, it looks like it, so it's really cool, I like it also man. The sound tracking in this game is awesome but the GBA version sounds like horseshit, right? It's like super MIDI and just mono and really bad, okay, I mean it's it's fine, it is, it's still the same game.",
