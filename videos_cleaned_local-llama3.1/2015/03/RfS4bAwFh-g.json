So, the idea here is that we're our brother and sister, and our father is dead, so this is his coffin, Jesus, and we are dragging it around. See, we're praying here; you're being very respectful, Freya. Yeah, but yeah, we're each going to have to attach things to it, drag it around, pull up through different things. This king looks young; this king looked like he had them when they were 10 or 11 years old. Yeah, see well, this is his whole thing now; now he's stuck. Now of course, for these people maybe they just don't age so quickly as we do. There's Freya, I don't think they're going to go into the backstory in terms of how people age and what they need to do, cuz I would want to know that.",

You know what I'm talking about no, I wish Dynasty Warriors no Dynasty Warriors, not the Atlas game... the um... what is it called? You know what I'm talking about where you're like the three different character classes and it's on like every console and they've made it like a million times since then. Oh, TR, it's TR, it's TR, yeah, they made a goddamn million of it. Kind of, I mean, it doesn't look like that but the like the cooperative puzzle thing where everyone does kind of different things reminds me... so this what I'm looking at with this Chariot is it's this is kind of got an all-terrain vehicle kind of thing going on.

Like his body can still be bruised and like what if the cause of death in this game is unsubstantiated and these two are accused of having something to do with his death? I would think by this point at the burial we've already decided - all right, there's been an autopsy. He's got that cool scar in his chest; they know what's up; they know what happened to him. I just... you know, I'd be afraid that some pretender to the throne might... You're thinking like how it works in Game of Thrones where they're like \"she's very mellan\" - you know what I mean?
