Absolutely not. AB definitely not. Kevin said something earlier that like it's been 68 in the making, coming all the way to number 69. Wow, it really has. We should have a quick announcement: we're retiring the show after this because this is the pinnacle. I can't get higher; this you can't get better. There's no point in doing anymore once you've hit 69. We do The GameOverGreggy Show, the new class. Yes, oh I like that. Uh, Greg is gone; he's in Mexico. Um, and so I'm hosting it again. I think I've hosted one other Game Over Greg show; I don't remember which one it was. Obviously, everyone knows that the tone and cadence of the show and I hosted is a little bit different. I'm not going to get loud and crazy; I'm not going to bang on this table. Although you guys can; oh, I will. This table, yeah. Give it to the table, and you just did you.",

The show is recorded all at once, as you're going to see here, and then we split it up topic by topic, day by day, as I think Greg says so. Here's how it basically goes: our Patreon support is at patreon.com/kindafunny - you get the episode first as an audio or video depending on your tier. But that's okay if you don't want to give us money, that's all good. The following Monday on youtube.com/gameovergreggy, each topic goes up until Thursday, then Friday the",

Do you have the friends that got married after high school or like stayed together from High School all the way through and now you're like I have these two friends specifically that I still see on Facebook and I'm like, still together; that's got to be so weird to have spent...

I think you're right when it comes to the perfect relationship; that doesn't exist, but that's like there's no definition to that; it's different for every person. It's the same thing what is love? We had a topic about that a long time ago. You can't really define that; like it's something different. What is art? Some things that kind of stand don't hurt me no more they didn't define it; they just asked it a bunch of times and then shook their heads, they don't. That was it. I mean, that's a good definition if that's what love is. Well, Alfredo asks, \"What is the perfect relationship?\" What are some of the factors that stand out? Basic things, and again, that is a person-by-person basis for me. I need someone, and this is something that you either teach your S.P., like your significant other, your spouse, whatever, or they know already, which is to teach them it, like because some people are used to, for instance, an abusive boyfriend, which I am not.",

Or like, explain it like you would to someone who's constantly with you, constantly wanting attention, constantly giving you attention, yeah coddling you being that way. I'm the exact opposite, like I and Cheryl knew this and learned this over time where it was like I need you to leave me alone. Like, you're my partner, our time together is much more precious, much more interesting and wanted when we have some time apart. And like, that's just real talk. And she knows that, like, when she gets home from work, she has a really serious job that's very taxing on her. She tells me all the time, \"Just leave me alone.\"",

And then we sit, you know, a couple hours later after we eat dinner and stuff, we lay in bed and watch a show or whatever, and that's our special time. Then she goes to bed early, and I peel off and play games in the living room. Like, if I didn't have like my own free time, then I couldn't possibly be happy in this relationship. So one thing must come before the other; so that's one of the things that really stands out - hopefully they come maybe at the same time, 69 coming at the same time... uh, so no, I hear you, that's that's the most important thing: if I cannot be happy with me and like my own time, and I just resent you for taking all my time, then that's going to be a huge problem for that relationship.

It's very true; some people need to be coddled, some people need to be held on to. When you ask that question, my first thing was saying like my perfect relationship is the one I have with my wife. It's not perfect; there is no such thing as perfect, not at all. But the reason why it's so good is because we've been together seven years; we've been through those trials and tribulations of having those really hard conversations about what each other needs. And that's really the most important thing: the perfect relationship you can have or you should try to find is someone with whom you can be open and honest. Because once you have that, then you have near perfection because you can tell the person, \"This is what I need right now.\" For instance, I'm very much like Colin; I do the exact same thing.",

And to Colin's point, that's where I'm at with my wife - right where every relationship I had had before that there was always sort of a \"and this is\" you put on yourself too because I don't think a lot of the women that I did put this on me but I'm always like I got to be sort of a better version of who I am right now in order to be seen in your eyes the proper way. And then I met my wife and she was like \"stop, why? Why? Just you, just be yourself.\" Do tone it down when we go to parties, that's all she asks - which is fair enough.
