I was like okay, like I had fun, it was an awesome two weeks, and it's like all right cool, I'm done with it. So similar to Titanfall in Destiny, I can't say that I've played like 800 of each game, but like no, I do get the other side more similar to Titanfall than yeah, more similar to Titanfall where it's just like this is this it's cool you know at its core gameplay awesome, but there's just not too much meat there. Um so yeah, so I went to go check out the new DLC content and um just an overview it comes with a new monster called the Behemoth we'll go into that in a second um you get two new maps and then I'm trying to figure out which one of your penis is I'm going to call that all right either one I'm down probably going to be Kevin's map, Kevin's map, the Behemoth uh so a new monster, two new maps, and then",

So one of the one of the core things that they tried to that they're doing with the DLC which I was really really happy with is that they're not trying to separate the community right. So when you get games like Call of Duty, it's like well all right new map pack comes out, well there's only this specific playlist that you can play that new map right and then you get this separate community. Then eventually it's just like well uh why I buy a new map pack none of my you know there's that one guy like Tim you don't have it me and Nick have it so we're not going to play the new map anymore right. And so the thing about this is if you don't have the new characters, like you can still play with them or against them, you know what I mean? You don't have to have the new DLC but you can all still be together right. So I think how do that work with",

An interesting thing about charging and taking a shot is that the monster has two layers: his shield and his health. Usually, what happens is you have to blow through his shield before you can get to his health. But with the Trapper Keeper... yeah, with the Trapper Crow, you can charge that shot and it goes directly into his health, so it's like this new interesting dynamic. He also has the mobile arena for trapping, and then he has a stasis gun. And he has this cool little thing about him, like all the Trappers have, that allows them to kind of track the monster. One has sensors, the other one has a little pet-like dog thing - it's like a monster dog-looking thing. Anyways, this guy has...",
