No, I spent all of my childhood and teenage years being irritated by arbitrary three-month waits for video games in Europe, and the reasons for that were like localization and stuff for all the European nations, and you know, especially Nintendo, it would be freaking years sometimes before...and then sometimes we would just never get the game, and it would be out in America, and it would be out in Japan, but we'd just never get it here. Um, now it's very different because sometimes we now get games earlier in Europe than everywhere else, and I don't know why this has happened, but things like, like especially Nintendo again, weirdly, they now release stuff here you know two or three weeks before the rest of the world, and uh, I think that it's it's stupid now to not have a worldwide release date. We have digital distribution; there is no valid reason for not having a worldwide release date if you haven't translated it into all the right languages then you've just **** up, you you've",

Sorry, we're really busy on this.\" And everyone doesn't buy it. It can really mess you up right, which goes back to what Greg was saying about just the review itself being pertinent to you know even if it's a bad review making yeah some press for your game yeah because I mean think about how people dodge Call of Duty and think about how people dodge Grand Theft Auto 5 like it was the plague you know what I mean so like there's just certain bombs you drop.

And I think what we were discussing earlier is that the paradigm of when games are coming out, when we expect big and good games to come out, is shifting. I think that the holiday season is good, and good games come out then, but that's when we expected a lot of our games like that - the mass of those games come out. I actually think now we're seeing games some of them being released in summer, I think Metal Gear Solid 5 is a cusp on a summer game which is really kind of interesting, and then you're seeing a lot of stuff in the spring as we're seeing right now - games that weren't ready for fall that are being pushed. I think that's spreading it out. I think that I think the conventional wisdom that holiday drives sales is absolutely true, but I also think the conventional wisdom is overstated that if you find a game and release it in summer or spring, it's gonna be just as successful.\n\nI corrected phonetic mistakes (e.g., \"Metal Solid\" to \"Metal Gear Solid\"), spelling errors (none found), and capitalized proper nouns like names (\"Tim Gettys\") and game titles (\"Metal Gear Solid 5\").

Dying Light is the perfect example; it would have done nothing in November. Yeah, exactly what I wrote. I wrote about it because I still freelance for RAN and I write a piece once a week over there, and I wrote about Dying Light: I'm like Dying Light did 1.2 million copies in its first week. Dying Light, in its lifetime, if it came out in November, would have done a million copies probably. So it's like that because Dying Light was it; mhm, everyone paid attention to it and found out, \"Oh, this is actually a really good game.\" Like I had no expectations for that game at all, but I wouldn't have had time to play it in November.

You know, because there was no rhyme or reason as to why like some of these games would come out and some of them wouldn't. I went totally nuts when I lived in Japan in 2008-9, and uh, when I moved there, I had all these memories from you know being a kid. I used to read this magazine called N64 Magazine - it was my favorite, and there was this guy called Will Overton who used to do all the import reviews right, and I'd be flicking through this and it'd be like \"Osumo 64 Mahjong Simulator\" or some weird RPG that would never happen.

Um, and so you would get an allotment of cartridges which you didn't have to pay ahead of time. And some publishers were bullish enough to make basically shadow publishers, so like Konami and Ultra were the same company, but they were separate because you could only release five games a year on an NES. They would make two companies to release 10 games. But there were other publishers that were much more cautious. Um, and actually when I did the history of Naughty Dog at IGN, I was talking to you know the founders of Naughty Dog and they would tell the story about when they made their first Genesis game, which is Rings of Power, an RPG that they only could make like 100,000 copies of because there were no more cartridges available.",

And that's where these indie games step up, where it's like \"it doesn't matter, we'll release whatever we want whenever we want to release it\" and this is our time, blah blah. It's amazing for Konami and I'm sure they want to shine, and so like it's like we could go out, we could go and be the traditional holiday launch and come on end of November or whatever, but why would we go to the end of October beginning of November when we can go to September and stand all alone for hopefully knock on wood a month you know before there is another main contender to try to steal our limelight away especially if they believe in the game and it's going to come out and do well, nines and tens and what not, people only have so much money",
