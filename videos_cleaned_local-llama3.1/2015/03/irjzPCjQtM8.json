We we all had our moments though, like I'm sure you guys got to work with her a bit more than I did, but we we had our moments. I don't know if you remember, I sure do. But at E3 2012-13, one of those, we did some conversations, we did some interviews, we talked about The Witcher, it was Witcher two or three, I don't know, it was three at that point probably. All the E3s have started to blend now. I've lost count of eight of them now and they've all just started to blend together into one big ball of misery - overhyped video games and dubstep, so much dubstep, and things that will be delayed.

Oh yeah, um I run Kotaku in the UK now, very fun, yeah. Haven't done IGN in the UK, I, I do Kentaku, but yeah, I, I just don't like E3 is fun to watch, E3 is not fun to work, you know, and uh so yeah we won't be doing that anymore, so I don't have to go. I get to go to E3 for the first time this year, this will be my 10th, I think, and uh just be happy but you know I feel like to a lot of Gamers and I know for me that growing up E3 was like this thing you look forward to all year just like there's two times of the year for gamers that are like the big things there's E3 which announces the games then there's November December when you're like",

And then there's GDC, which I always wanted to be excited about because I'm from San Francisco and it would happen here - nothing's happening here, this is foret who help with their business. And you know the weird thing was uh when I was growing up reading magazines, you'd just run out the door when the post-E3 magazine deadlines would happen, you'd just be like 'Ah, just grabbing everything off the shelves consuming it all.'

And uh the great thing about GDC now is that you can watch all of it, it's all on the Vault online, and you can just watch these talks so if you just happen to be really interested in I know it's a particular developer or Shemue or whatever you can just watch you know an hour of a guy talking about what it was like to make it and release it and I think that's great we never used to be able to do that no no that I would have loved that when I was a teenager sure yeah",

And it'll be out in America, and it'll be out in Japan, but we just never get it here.
