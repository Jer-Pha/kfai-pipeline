            "text": "Greetings and salutations, welcome to Kinda Funny Games. My name is Colin Moriarty, this is Tim Gettys. And Tim, we're here to talk about a trifecta of Nintendo News today. Three important things were announced yesterday about Nintendo. Something specifically that a lot of people thought was going to happen a long time ago and then maybe never would, ultimately. Yeah. So let's unpack these things one by one. And, and talk about them. I think the way I want to start first is Nintendo is going to officially sanction the creation of a plethora of mobile games. Yes. Smartphone games and tablet games. Now to be clear, these are not going to be ports of existing games and they are partnering with DeNA, which is a significant talented Japanese mobile developer to get these games out there. So on the periphery, how does this news strike you? I love this. I mean, the thing is a lot of people hate this and people hate mobile games. I don't get that. Mobile games are good and yes, there's a shit ton of really bad",

Mobile games are good and yes, there's a shit ton of really bad ones. But when you get a good mobile game, you can play that thing forever and your phone's always on you. So I think that's a good thing. When you get a developer like Nintendo that makes amazing games and if you have them making a game for that platform. And I like the fact that they're like, oh, we're not just going to port 3DS or Wii U stuff. Right. Do I wish that they'd have some virtual console things and old ones? Yeah, but then again it's like, no, when you play Sonic, like Sonic 1 or 2 that Sega put on it, it feels like shit. It's not meant for that. But if they're making a Pok\u00e9mon game for iOS, holy crap, that sounds amazing to me. I don't want no, you know, Pok\u00e9mon Candy Crush. I'm talking a Pok\u00e9mon RPG. A real Pok\u00e9mon game. That can be amazing. Yeah, I think that this is a nice",

Yeah, I think that this is a nice acknowledgement on Nintendo's part, first of all, that touch controls cannot work for their games. Nintendo's known largely for tight controlling, really well made games. And so saying like we're not going to port something like Mario Galaxy or something with a phone or a tablet makes a lot of sense to me. Adam described this decision as rational, which I think is exactly what it is. A lot of internet business people out there that don't seem to understand money always talk about how Nintendo has all this money in the bank, 18, 19 billion dollars. Not understanding that that money will whittle away to zero dollars very quickly if they don't have something to sustain their business. Wii U is largely a dud. 3DS is significantly flagging behind, or lagging behind rather the DS. So they need",

Wii U is largely a dud. 3DS is significantly flagging behind, or lagging behind rather than the DS. So they need to go in a different direction and this makes a lot of sense. Now with that said, this will dilute, I think, some of Nintendo's ability to stay in hardware ultimately. And I think we'll get to that in a minute with another announcement they made. But consider this: People will buy a Pok\u00e9mon game; the rest of the Pok\u00e9mon games sold a few million copies. And people buy 3DSs for a Pok\u00e9mon game. Now if you can get a core Pok\u00e9mon game or a Pok\u00e9mon-style game on your phone or your tablet, you no longer need that hardware. This is the inherent catch-22 that Nintendo finds themselves in, but they knew they were gonna find themselves in. Yeah, eventually, it had to happen. But here, imagine this though, Colin. What if it's not Pok\u00e9mon games? What if it's like Elite Beat Agents? What if it's these things",

What if it's these things that aren't gonna sell the 3DS and stuff, but would be amazing and right at home on that platform? I think that's great. It would be cool, this is going to require a very careful dance with Nintendo as the IP holder and Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast developer and distributor of the games. I think that this is a logical idea. I am just really interested to see how this affects other parts of their business, which brings us to the second announcement, which is Nx, Project Nx. This is their next, what they call a quote, dedicated gaming system, end quote. And they just tease that this is in development. Now this isn't surprising. Sony is probably, for instance, already R&Ding PlayStation 5, and Microsoft is probably already R&Ding what the next Xbox will be. This happens many years in advance, so it's not",

This happens many years in advance, so it's not surprising that they're working on the new concept. The fact that they would announce it - That's important for them to do. A little interesting. It's important for them to say, listen- Going back to the phone stuff, that's this year. Yep, Fall 2015, I have that right here, Fall 2015. Which is crazy. So the ball's in play. Yeah, there's a little confusion, because some people are thinking that the NX is this year. No, no, no, there's no way, there's no way. Although I think the NX might be 18 months to two years away. I mean, that's just my conjecture based on what we've often been talking about a hybrid console handheld system, which is what this could be. They could describe this as a new concept. And with the announcement of the Nintendo DNA partnership, a lot of people say that it gave them an",

And with the announcement of the NVIDIA partnership, a lot of people say that it gave them an even stronger passionate vision for hardware. Now this is a necessary announcement for them to make, or at least a necessary tease for them to make to let their core gamers know that hardware is still coming and they will continue to support hardware. Yeah, we're not just going mobile completely. But what I'm, there's, again, there's an inherent conundrum here. Nintendo's in a significant conundrum now because, in my opinion, they cater mostly towards, and I don't wanna say completely, but mostly towards, or try to cater mostly towards a more casual and a younger audience. The casual and younger audience is already on a smartphone and tablet. They're going to eat up the Nintendo, those NVIDIA games by Nintendo. Are they therefore gonna go in this other direction? It's",

Are they therefore gonna go in this other direction? It's almost, it's a similar kind of question. Like how are they gonna cannibalize our hardware sales? And as I was talking to Greg before, I'm not sure that Nintendo can have their cake and eat it too with this announcement. Like they're putting everything forward, but will they be able to sustain both of these ecosystems without destroying one or the other remains to be seen. It seems like the Switch announcement though is pure money for them. Yeah. The final thing they announced, Tim, was a membership service. Yes. And this is kind of nebulous. I don't really know what this means, but it's something that tethers the Wii U, 3DS, PC, phone and tablet together. And the NX. And the NX when that comes out. So what's interesting about that, I mean, essentially, this is why Club Nintendo died. This is the",

I mean, essentially, this is why Club Nintendo died. This is the future of Club Nintendo, and it's some ecosystem that works between all the different things, which is cool. I mean, hey, that's a good thing. There's nothing bad about that. Yeah, this is, I think, the thing that's most in the air and something I'm most interested to see what this actually materializes to be for the end user. You know, what do I want it to be? I want it to be the thing that we've always dreamed of, which is the whole cross buy, cross save, cross all this stuff. Which if you buy a virtual console game, you can play it on any of these things. Yeah, I mean, that would be interesting, but man, being able to... like you were saying before, phone games and tablet games are good. And I agree they can be good, but they are not, in my opinion, for core purchases. And I don't",

So I don't know, it would be cool to have a Wii U and 3DS cross save and cross platform kind of thing going on. Phone and tablet, obviously. This, again, brings in the nature of the NX, which some people are wondering, is this a phone? Is this like, is this, you know? That's the question. Is it a phone? Is it the successor of the Wii U? Is it the successor to the 3DS? Or is it something that's kind of successor to both the 3DS and Wii U where it's a mobile home console and handheld thing, kind of what everyone thought the Wii U originally was. Right, and I wonder, there's a lot of questions, because Nintendo, people have been pointing out on the internet rightfully so, Nintendo uses the word platform very",

Right, and I wonder, there's a lot of questions, because Nintendo, people have been pointing out on the internet rightfully so, Nintendo uses the word platform very loosely, which Amiibo I think is considered a platform, as someone was saying. So I think that them using the word hardware is very significant. They're making sure you understand this is hardware. Also, there was like a flow chart, not flow chart, there's just like a chart and Amiibo's not on there. So it's like, these are definitely consoles in their head. Yeah, so I mean, I don't know, Tim, I mean, I think this is significant news. This was a necessary step. This is a logical step. I'm interested to see how this, I think this will affect their business in the short term very positively. I wonder how it'll affect their legacy long term in terms of being able to create hardware.

Because with Wii U not struggling to even get to 10 million units after two plus years on the market, which is abysmal, their hardware, their home console sales are already really bad. 3DS is still a success when you don't compare it against DS, which I think is really important. Yeah. But again, will this cannibalize their ability to do hardware? It seems like having to take an E to 2 situation. I'm a little less worried about if it affects that negatively, as much as it's, I fear that the mobile stuff will be so successful for them, that it'd be stupid for them not to just put all their eggs in that basket, and then slowly kind of go that way. It seems like you might be right. I think, this is fascinating, I was reading about this after I did my Mega Man marathon yesterday, I was in bed after dinner reading this, and I was like, holy shit.

Well, I don't blame Nintendo fans for being upset about this, because I do think this signals a new age for Nintendo. An age that you might not like very much. Yeah, that's true. My big question is, what does this mean for Zelda, Wii U? Like, are they gonna pull another Twilight Princess and- That's an interesting point. Delay it to come out with this new system. Invert it so it's a backwards game. Exactly. To make Link right handed. That's it for us. Tim Gettys, thank you so much for joining me on this. Oh yeah.
