Let's see... I haven't played in a while. Map, bring it up here. Chug a little bit there you go. Put your waypoint on there all the way over here. So it's quite far away still. You got this. Um, but let's just do it. Let's just see what happens shall we? Sounds good. You're about I think I'm only about 15-20% through the game's actual story, but I know better than to play at night. Yeah, so at night... So this will be interesting to see where we go with this. The game gets really harrowing at night. Yes, harrowing is a great word for it.

I wonder if it's here at all now, how long do those stay? I haven't... I haven't gotten to that place where I've made one of night vision boosters, yeah. Um, and and it's it actually lasts quite a while, and there was one particular side quest I was having quite a bit of difficulty with that I used it on, yeah. Um, and and it proved to be quite helpful there, but uh I don't know if it's necessary.

You don't... probably not for the specific mission there are certain \"Missing\" missions that I've uh that I've encountered whether you have to play at night, yeah. And that's it - it's hard and that sucks, it's really hard. Uh but for the most part especially when you first start off the game it's important to realize that you can actually go to your uh your sleeping bag and reset the day. You sleep for 12 hours and go back and do most of the missions during the day which makes it infinitely more easy. Um what do you remember, what mission you're on right now? So there's a there's a like a man you meet in the beginning in like a trailer he's a doctor - do you know the character think his name is Zer?

But there's some that are just weird, like I tend to not play these games the way you're supposed to in that a lot of it relies on stealth and sort of agility. I like to power up and be a tank as I walk through the game, which does not help you at the beginning or probably ever, no, not in a game certainly not in a game like this. Because I found some I found some of the skills cool, like for instance some of the blocking and parrying moves that you can get, like so if a zombie's coming at you, you can hit X and move and it'll throw them off a cliff or something like that.

There's some there's some inconspicuous doors I don't know if you've noticed in the game that can be opened. Well, they tend to do that thing to you too where they put you specifically in that spot where you have to hit the lever, open the door, and it takes a second because it's stuck because it's rusted over, and you've got zombies behind you that are about ready to chew your face off. Oh definitely. Um, it does a really good job of sort of making uh parts of your body pucker up a little bit. Now looks like you're moving around.

And it's a way to make you want to go out there and explore it because everything you see can be explored. That's yeah, it can. And for the most part, you can go in any building, loot it all that stuff.

Whenever I see string or alcohol, yeah, and then I make some more right now and this guy gets five more Molotovs. They're really like overpowered but it's awesome. Like this guy's on fire; he's going to die, he's resisting it, but he's eventually gonna have to go. And then we can... He's still up and running; he might want to go take him. Is he? Oh my God, how is he? Oh, he's tough; he's charred; he's not happy. He was a little... He was a little uh confused to begin with, and you just kind of set it straight. I got to get I got to get that power up. Yeah, it's so good, dude. That's pretty amazing. Oh man, how often do you go after the loot drops like the the air drops that happen? Not not often.

That's another cool element of the game is you'll just be sitting there and you'll see a plane drop supplies off because you're in this world, in this fictional city called Harran, where it's been cordoned off so the military is doing air drops to drop supplies, medicine, and things like that. But most of the rival gangs go and steal them, and so if you can find one when you're close to it, you can go after it and get it. But you might find it might be perfectly fine by itself or it might have a rival gang that's waiting there for you, and you either have to kill them or just skirt around them. In more instances than not, I don't even mess with them because they have weapons. Yeah, you eventually get firearms, and I don't even bother with them; I don't feel like they're that strong.

There's really no there's not a lot of incentive to do the side quest, but you seem like you earn the experience incrementally, which is kind of cool, and I don't know if you noticed this too, um, I think it's actually in the start, if I press start, I started at 28% now I'm at 29%, instead of instead of it measuring your completion based on completing whole missions, it actually it actually does track your completion and your and your progress by checkpoint, that's cool, which is I think actually kind of neat because it makes you feel like you're getting somewhere, yeah, so I got some more alcohol there, and yeah, I might be a little more thorough than than some people playing the game but oh here's a",

So power cable... so when I'm getting nails or blades or power cables, whatever this is all to be.
