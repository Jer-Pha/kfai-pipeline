We had an amazing panel, amazing best friends of course came out. We have something for the first time ever to do on this show - we have a supporter who went and did the $3,000 tier shoutout for a month. My God, so he gets a month of shoutouts here on this show. Uh, he's a supporter just like you. His name is Peach Goblin, everyone knows Peach Goblin. You might remember him; he submitted songs before, I think we played him on Beyond right? That's how we became aware of him outside of the fact that he's totally helpful on Twitch and helps out Alfredo all the time. However, he's got a new album out, a new Dynamite rap.",

I'm very excited you brought oh man, Greg has notes. Oh no, notes he lost his notes. It was dramatic. You tried, you tried, you tried hard but it backfired. It was very dramatic. It was...

I went to the IGDA (Independent Game Developers Association) Awards and the Game Developers Choice Awards, and on the back they had this little thing to keep track of it so I took comprehensive notes as you can see for things we need to like just arrows and x's. It doesn't really look very... comprehensive notes as you can see. Then I went and got business cards for things I want to talk about so I have plenty to talk about. What would you like to hear about, Colin? Whatever you want, I'll start with this one.

The first one I got in my hand is Y2K. Did you see this one? No. Postmodern RPG. It's set... it's post-RPG, yeah. It's goofy. It's in America. I want to say it's in Portland, but I'll forget that part. Guy definitely looks like a hipster with a beard and flannel. You already know I'm going with the '90s are alive in Portland. He's in a record store right there. So you get it, Colin. What this is is the Japanese RPG gameplay put into an English game where this man is like living with his mom. His life's not so hot. An American game exactly meets this girl, then he's got to go... this thing. There's parts of like... there's like some platforming in there. There's some Zelda-like bomb",

A killer Earthbound hipster hybrid, Heaven according to Destructoid take on RPG battles with vinyl records, Norm core threads and weaponized Panda plushies. Brave parallel Dimensions existential humor and Meandering Exposition right, Panda plushies. Uh, what's most exciting me about this is that it's coming to Vita, yes, PlayStation 4, and Wii U. Y, a postmodern RPG. Okay, so that's the sub when you said when you called it a postmodern RPG, I'm like, what are you talking about? How is it a post-RPG, but it's actually calling itself that?

If you're ever in France, you see the different colored lines right there, and trains moving on these lines while you watch, and it's, you know, just like a map would look or whatever the subway system is. And you have to give them the best routes to drop off their passengers; their passengers are represented by basic shapes - triangle, circle, square. You can see how many like different ones you can tell, like okay, I have a lot of squares in this train, but it's going way away, but I got to try to get it to the square drop-off point faster, get these people to the triangle route faster.

The only thing that changed month over month was that some of the order changed and Dying Light was in there, and Just Dance fell off. I remember that like very well, and I'm like this is the most boring stuff ever. Like these are the games, and again, this is only judging retail, but it shows a stagnation and a predictability in the retail market that is slowly going to whack as their popularity wanes and people kind of go more to the digital space. I keep telling you over and over again the AAA model is a dying model, and it's not that it's going to die completely; it's just that someone has to be bold enough at some point to say like this is a AAA-style game that is $40, this is",

Um, it just shows a space that is stagnant and boring. It's not to say those games are bad; it's just a boring space. And so I think the big success story for this generation will be the independent game developer - the independent game developers. Again, how you define that, I don't know. You know, like No Man's Sky is a really important game for PlayStation 4, and it's bought by an independent studio but it's not really an independent game. You know? So like we in the future, we really need to... We talked about this on Colin, Greg, Colin, and Greg today where it was like what is the definition of independent and indie, and really it's doing funding your own games and making your own games.

Um, yeah, and calling an indie game a \"barded\" is not effective as an insult anymore because people are way excited about these games now, which is awesome. Indie Station, yeah, I love my Indie Station because it has games to play unlike so many other platforms out there, so it's like... I'm fine with that.
