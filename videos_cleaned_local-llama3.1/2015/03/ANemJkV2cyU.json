We're not trying to create goggles or anything like that, but it was mainly in the cord management because especially with Oculus you have to have that camera that has to be looking at your head and you have a cord going from the Oculus to whatever is outputting the video. Uh, you can't do a full 360 because you're going to fixate yourself on the cord, and secondly if that camera isn't really seeing you you're not able to get that full 360 degree image. Uh, so the chair that we've worked on it allows for all the connections to come in at a stationary part of the base so you can go full 360, and there's a table that you can put the camera on so you're always getting the head tracking that you need.
