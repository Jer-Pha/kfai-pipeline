Go Islanders indeed. They in the playoffs yet? Is it playoff time? No, not yet, but they'll make it. They'll be fine. They play the Rangers tonight. I have hope. They'll clinch probably in the next couple weeks, and then the playoffs start in April. When does the puck drop? The puck drops today at 4 o'clock. That was my favorite thing when we went to Boston, is Colin kept saying, oh yeah, the puck drops at 4:30. It's just like, wow, that's a thing. That's what they say. It's a real thing. Oh yeah. Over there, the pure one, Tim Gettys. Let's get nasty. Oh my goodness. That's a different. Over here, the producer slash seducer, Nick Scarpino. Go Devils. No, everybody!

I think it's Scout the 6th now or something like that. Does he live on campus? Does the dean take care of him? I don't know, I just see him every once in a while. We have a statue of a Husky too that everyone rubs his nose. Sure, good luck. You gotta do that. But you don't do that with a real Husky. That's what we have Kevin for. We can do that with Thomas Jefferson. We just have people rub his nose. They rub Thomas Jefferson's dick. You sit next to him and then it's what, Francis? Whatever, it doesn't matter.

No No, no, when were these what what years are we so 2003 to 2007? Yeah, and Ramon was there in 2008. So Northeastern is a five-year school, but I didn't for yeah I didn't because I won't because you co-op I didn't co-op so Northeastern has a unique thing called it's not it's not a unique thing some schools do it but Northeastern is well known and has the best co-oping program in the United States, which is They do a thing called middler year in between sophomore and junior year middle or middle or year to third year So junior year is your fourth year and senior is your fifth year Middle",

You don't have to do it. Ramon did it. I did stuff at Sony Music in LA for a little bit, and what else? You interned for a radio station and ended up tour managing a band.

So one of the great Traditions like many colleges is scavenger hunts And this was one of our scavenger hunts where we had to do like all sorts of we'll see more pictures that are a little More heinous, but we had to like go meet. I don't know. I know what this was from what I remember It was that one of the scavenger hunt items was get a picture of someone at Dunkin' Donuts Smiling and this guy wouldn't smile for us and this is basically what his impression of a smile It took us like 10 minutes to get him to do that from my picture too, by the way Kevin Yeah, so, you know that more Every scavenger you had to take pictures and you know give proof and you know",

He has this is alcohol shirt. Certainly in the in the cup This was in the hallway. This is the hallway outside of Chris our Dorm room now these two pictures were taken for a specific reason because we used to do this thing called juke mania, which was a football league a Madden League that we used to do and juke mania what so juking and football is like when you move around and Ramon get really mad at our friend Chris because he would juke too much knows Kevin.

The next picture is important because this is the well, let's just look at so this is the Bart Simpson Bong now. The Bart Simpson Bong is the origin of one of the great northeastern stories of all time. You tell this story awesome. So, so this is a Picture 13 and so Ramon's brother got him a Bart Simpson Bong as you can see in this picture which Ramona smoked.

But anyway, so this this Bong is instrumental; it's a really...I'll let Ramon tell the story because it's...this bong is like a notorious piece of...it's a relic of our friendship, not only me and Ramone's relationship with a relationship with a lot of our friends.

His time was divided amongst playing video games and school and putting hats and other hats. Yeah, that too, but you know he was staying up till all hours at that time, you know.

My topic is I've been thinking a lot lately and this does tie into actually my relationship with Colin as well and when we were kids how obsessed we were with the band 311. And but with the reason why I'm bringing that up is because I feel like in this day and age everything is maybe things are oversaturated where you have too much access to movies and shows and music was you know Spotify for instance. And because there's just so much access to everything, is it harder to really develop like true favorites and true obsessions? I mean it depends on you know the how you look at it, I guess. And maybe it could be because we're older and you know maybe it's an attention span thing. I mean, I often think that a lot for me at least.

We didn't have any money on us, and This I don't know - Kevin thinks that this makes us good people. I think it makes us fucking atrocious, horrible people. We were also like 11 at the time.
