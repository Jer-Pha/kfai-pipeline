Metal Gear Solid is this again a big thing right now with The Order: 1886. I don't know if you've heard of this game. I've heard of it, okay go. It looks it looks beautiful, it's very beautiful not incredibly long, not the shortest um we're saying if you want to speed run it and do it blah blah blah when you're making a game as a developer is that what you're thinking? You know where does your head space that in terms of the end experience how long is going to be our use making a story making gameplay what are you doing yeah that's what the hell you went over there. Awesome question, I've never heard like yeah this kind of come up in the press or like in on podcasts like that is how developers gauge play time yeah that's a really good one. I you should ask smarter people than me and with whom I'll have more experience but from my from your perspective",

Maybe even let the order guys were like, \"Oh man, we were shipping like a three-hour game.\" And 06 alright, bad oh yeah, the other weird thing this gets to the more publisher side of things, I think. But the unfortunate thing about Alien: Isolation for example, where it seems like they might have had at it too long right because they're worried about black box value and sometimes stuck too much is a bad thing right? So when I was concerned with The Order, right, leave way when leading up to when they were talking about not making it longer than people are saying it is but we jump around a lot. We want you to feel different right, we want every gun to feel different, whatever scenario to be different every time you pick it up. We want you to be doing something different so there isn't repetition right and then it was like well now there's no flow to the game, there's no pacing to the game.",

And then it was like, well, now there's no flow to the game, there's no pacing to the game. And what does that matter when Alien: Isolation, yeah, is just like the first eight hours are great and then there's more. Why are we still going into this? Right? Or true or false: if the order was just an amazing, incredible, unbelievable six hours, seven hours, we wouldn't be having this conversation. We would have been people would be saying, \"Oh, this is how a game should be.\" I like yeah, like a six- or seven-hour really, really top-notch triple-A experience. But maybe that's not what the game is right? No, I mean not to me. I mean, I was thinking... I've been talking about when we played The Order and you know all these things started breaking. We couldn't talk about it. And one of the things I was frustrating us was like, \"I don't think the\"",

I'm like that 90 minutes was precious. I would pay hundreds of dollars to get 90 minutes like that again out of a game. Yeah, and so that is my suggested equation for value: what is the game do and what does it deliver? Unfinished Swan is another really good example of that. Like these games that are short but awesome as opposed to you know people forget when they're like \"Well, Final Fantasy 6 took 60 hours or seven hours to be an I'm like yeah but Final Fantasy 6 is able to take advantage can advantage of the conventions of the JRPG genre which no other genre does which is they can just pad it however they want. Here's another engine; well, it's not even dungeons as much as its grinding. Like you can type via reticle.

So I think that people are losing sight of that. You know, yeah, again I think it was an awesome game, I think people would put this thing up on a pedestal as maybe the future of games, yeah right, yeah. I mean it's maybe the game should have been forty dollars, I don't know. Maybe that's more of a question of whether the game was developed for a long time at a triple-A studio, or if it's a publisher not wanting to explore this middle ground that could exist even for retail products, but Jim Sterling actually said he did a piece on",

Yep, no and that's right, yeah, and that has like a bad or a mystique about it - it's just not no bueno, they don't want yeah, um so I don't know, I bet they've run the numbers to like oh yeah what happens you know, focus groups if we sell the game for nineteen ninety nine less people buy it looks is there's a procedure of her annoying yeah, I bet there's something to that, yeah, it's interesting, it's this this particular argument just gets me in the same way that the indie downloadable space kind of argument gets me where it's like games that aren't sixty dollars on have value and games that aren't 20 hours are not valuing I'm like what",

Yeah, it's weird like the whole argument also just segues out of the specific argument of game length or how long is but like this whole argument also just values outside of length about we talked about a little bit before about and we have some great viewers who were saying like that they would prefer to buy our game as opposed to getting a code from you, we were giving them away in Colony.

It's a really bad way to interact with consumers to the limited degree you even have interaction with on the app store, which isn't a whole other problem but we still embrace it. I actually have really good feelings about the long-term viability of our game on the app store because there are 1 billion iOS devices out there. Getting the game in front of even like a small percentage of that is a great opportunity. Yeah, it's interesting to talk to different developers who have experience on the iOS store and Sean Vanaman, an Android developer, just in the sense of how their games succeeded or didn't and how people are talking about DrinkBox actually going to Vita with 14 million of them, whatever there are.",

I was less than I ever played a game on my iPad; I usually just used to read and they gave it to me, you know. They gave it for free, and then it's just like it constantly nickels and dimes you in the app, and I'm like, \"Dudes, like I would have given you twenty dollars if you'd just left me alone.\" And now since you're bothering me, I'm gonna be **** yeah, like that's that's the whole thing. That's all I'm not even gonna play your game, ya know?

With the way that, yeah, I think consumers been trained, and the consumers that will pay six figures into some of these iOS games if you let them, they will, yeah. And well, that's the same thing with Patreon right? Like it's like you have these people who will support you and try to give this developer more money, right?
