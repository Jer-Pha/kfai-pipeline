Te just like in the NHL '94 era, Eric Lindros versus Kelly at center with the old Cooper helmet on. Rod Brind'Amour versus Johan Garpenl\u00f6v left forward. I don't know why they're calling it left forward - no one calls it that. Mark Recchi versus Pat Falloon at right wing forward, and then Darius Kasparaitis versus and Giacomo Versace Wilson Gary Gallion, yep! And then in goal we'll have Stom Tommy Soderstrom who later played for the Islanders and artist BB who is very underrated in this game. Are we ready to go? Let's play. He had the best mask - yeah, he had that round, bulbous mask. I think all these guys had bulbous heads in this game.

Ramon telling or Greg telling Ramon to shut up for no real reason; I'm developing our rivalry that we have coming up in a little bit. A Slap Shot Pat smack talk - oo anyway, it's a defensive battle here so far. Herb has a hard time holding onto that uh that particular came rebound. Oh no! Oh and there's going to be a penalty; it looks like there was a hook there. Oh charging! That doesn't look exactly what uh what I was thinking.

If no, actually I was thinking about it in the sense that no one was really even doing that in the NHL at that time. Yeah, you weren't blocking that's a thing of today's game gotcha very much like post-lockout yeah there's not enough one things they added to make the game more interesting like all right you guys can come back to play hockey but you got to lie down. Well I think it I think it came as part often as part of the they got rid of the clutch and grab so defenseman taking another tool out of the box and that was laying down in front of a puck cuz it's not so much about shots on net R it's about scoring opportunities you see no like",

Yeah, Greg, just like I need a little breather, you know they're taking us to our limit here; that's his strategy, break up the pace. What the heck are you doing in the GARP lob? Just nowhere to be found so Kellio comes and gets the puck, picks it up waiting for someone to get open in front of the net - no one's there. Oh, the defenseman, that's an interference. I wouldn't be able to play and commentate at the same time; that's pretty uh, it's pretty impressive, I got to say. Yeah, you can't walk and chew gum, yeah, that might be true.

Maybe the developers hated Lindros too; they're like nope, no Hatcher frame. S Gobbles the puck up but is a penalty on Philadelphia for tripping Mark Recchi. Oh look at that, oh look at that ref, that move. He was like an old ref recently wrote an article about how Lindros and Lindros is now suing him. Oh really? I hope he doesn't sue us. Yo, I heard you said the developers didn't like me and wouldn't let me have hat tricks. Suit up and touch me, and I'll suit up man.
