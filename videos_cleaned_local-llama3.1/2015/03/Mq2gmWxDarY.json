When that came out on the Super Nintendo, that was a big deal, you know, and we had never really seen anything like that. It was really a revolutionary thing. And then they re-released it again with Mario World - that was definitely the first HD remake. I was like, \"This is cool because they weren't doing it for everything.\" They didn't do it for everything; you didn't see Konami do it with Castlevania or Capcom do it with Mega Man. You didn't see Tecmo at the time doing it with Ninja Gaiden - not on the Super Nintendo, but there wasn't this propensity to re-release everything and expect that well now it's time to bring it to this and now it's time",

Yes, I understand people didn't own the old consoles and people didn't get to play those games. You don't have to play whatever you want. I don't mean like that, but you don't have to play everything. It's okay; we can make excuses for literally any game. So, that cannot be the justification. I can say oh, we didn't play Naughty Dog's The Last of Us, we got to have it back. You know what I mean? Running at 20 frames a second instead of five. Yeah, you know like you know what I'm saying.

Like, what makes the game special and why does it need to exist today is the question we have to ask. But I think a lot of that doesn't come from The Gamers being like, \"Well, I didn't get to play it.\" It's more like the developers are like, \"They didn't get to play this game.\" Like, there's this whole new set of people that are looking for games, especially now when they're not those AAA titles out there yet. Where it's like, \"Hey, we can now give these people these experiences we've already made,\" you know, that we want them to have as part of their experience to get them ready for Arkham Knight or to get them ready for whatever the hell the next thing is.

And um, you can never remake it in a way that's satisfactory, so you don't bother. Yeah, so you just say, 'Well, here it is.' Just like they did with Final Fantasy X; they just put in widescreen, they didn't do anything with that game. They up-resed the game and put the International Version on it, and they totally re-edited the music. I think you're giving it a little too much credit; they completely re-did the music, Tim. This was this was a hash job that they did, and they're doing it again on PS4.

The point is, they treated 10 like even though they didn't do much to 10, they treated it like it was something special and they made it an event; they didn't just rush it out or whatever. And I give them credit for that too. There was real hype when we were at E3 one year in excitement; I remember wondering and asking aloud like why aren't we covering this game? One because people are really into it, MH. So I think you have to just kind of take things as they come; not everything needs to be re-released. I certainly question I'm not a huge DMC fan by any stretch of the imagination, but when they're re-releasing Devil May Cry 5 two years after it came out, I'm like why?
