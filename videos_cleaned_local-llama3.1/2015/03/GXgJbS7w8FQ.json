I think I think that's the truth but I'm curious what you think about this particular game we're playing on our Retron 5. Yeah, this is a Retron 5 so yeah we're starting it up here. I'm excited about this machine here, this machine can play all the classic games. I got my game back from New York, so see come in here get the Metropolis setting - it's Metropolis, present day. A peaceful summer evening when suddenly those periods are totally unnecessary after the uh metropolis and present day Metropolis, present day a complete power failure now you'd think this is the work of Doomsday right?

That's the sad part is that even though we're going to get you through the first level here, I imagine we're not going to get to show you Cyborg Superman playing as Cyborg, playing as Conner Superboy Steel. They had everybody in it - The Eradicator, like this. Like I was so people always say there's no good Superman game and there's never been an amazing Superman game but this is...this one is like probably the closest to you know. It was all these nerdy comic characters that nobody you know, you know, that weren't it was a big deal when Superman died of course but like not many people jumped on the Superboy bandwagon the way Greg Miller did and fell in love with him and cheered for him the rest of his life but it was...it was a love letter to us fans of the",

And what's funny about this to me too is that this genre is dead today, and I don't understand quite why because I feel like these kinds of games - you know, not that you know Double Dragon was awesome, and and um, you know we played The Simpsons on Kinda Funny Games, which is not a very good game. But Konami was making a lot of those kinds of games, X-Men, um, and we only have gotten like a few really notable ones in the last even 10 years, like I'd say Castle Crashers is one of them, which is fantastic. I feel like they just they always sound like a good idea and then they aren't. Like I remember when Scott Pilgrim was coming up, and we played it in prev, like this is awesome, and then we got it, and like I was like oh yeah, I kind of remember why I don't like these - like if it's annoying in this game even you'll see me start punching and I'm like oh.",

Do you think it would come back with the advent of PSN and Xbox Live? Um, but that was the cool thing with like when they re-released Final Fight - right, that was like one of the nice additions, like you know, okay, you can play online with all your friends and do this... That was one of the downsides if you remember, I think what killed Scott Pilgrim was why nobody really cared about that, yeah, no online play. Like, what would I do that for? That was weird.
