Uh, largely because I think you guys are rubbing off on me playing a lot of PS4, reading a lot of DC Comics that's the kind of funny way um thinking about getting a Vita. It's the Kinda Funny way um thinking about getting a Vita. Someone actually offered if I got a Vita they said they'd buy me Persona dancing all night is that that I get that correct uh which sounds like something that I thoroughly would not enjoy but I'll give it a shot cuz I'm open to everything thank you uh including taking Kevin to Disneyland with me which I I'm sure would be again 50/50 pro and con uh you literally have different numbers 10 seconds ago all right 70, 70:30 um but one of the things I've noticed is that DC is a you know like Marvel they're great storytellers right and I think they they tend to be a little bit better in the storytelling uh on the comic side than they are on the motion picture side",

You know? So it's like... but okay, so backing up to that, why is it okay for them to make an animated movie where Superman is the son of Zod, but they can't do that, they can't take that risk or that liability with a live-action film because it's the audience it's aimed at. It's like you said he's in \"Man of Steel\" - we get that, we understand that at a base level, whereas a mainstream audience doesn't and that's why they burn so much time with these movies where they have to come out and set up who they are and tell the origin and do this to overexplain who this character is because a gazillion people who have never even heard of him are going to go see that film and get introduced to that character.",

Yeah, it's a no. I'm with you that it's a huge problem that they don't have a way around yet. If people don't know the origins of Spider-Man at this point, they're never going to get it. I mean, Spider-Man's the one real example of that happening now, that's just ridiculous. We're going for a third retelling of Batman where they're going to show... yeah, I mean we already saw in the trailer the slow motion gun, but I feel like Flash is a flashback, exactly like making a nod to what happened in this feels like the first time where they're really doing something in the movie.

Is this like a comic book that thrives and does well; are there people who are ride or die for it? This gets into a whole other crazy can of worms because all these film rights have been like you know they don't do The Fantastic Four; Marvel's been slow in its role with The Fantastic Four Comics, so it's like there's a lot of political games going on in every sense.
