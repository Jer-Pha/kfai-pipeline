This game came out in 1998 on N64, obviously. This was this came out about four years before uh Rare was purchased by Microsoft outright, so this is one of their last independent games. Um, and uh it's well loved, uh got a got a you know got a sequel in Banjo-Kazooie also that Nuts & Bolts game, although I don't really know anything about that game. Yeah, I don't either.
