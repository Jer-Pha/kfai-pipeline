This is spurred by the announcement or rumors of the PS4's 13-point-0 and the Xbox One's August update. So, Xbox now has 1080p60 game streaming - so you can stream games and it's essentially standard for video stuff at this point. The problem there is once the Xbox One games aren't 1080 anyway, so this is just like... it was a little weird. Yeah, it's cool for the future, they'll get the game super effing yeah. You can now right-click on one of your friends and select 'send message' or invite to party more quickly - connect with your friends. I'm sure that's something that people who do that are super stoked about. Notifications: you can enable or disable them for when you're invited to parties, which is awesome because we get that all the time when we're doing Let's Plays. You can see an animated display showing how you recently played games - so you can go into those and compare.\"",

I mean, that's that's the future, right, and that's what I get excited about. Is like every day I know you guys check you go play games well guess what I log on or not allowed on I fire up my PS4 and the first thing I do is check Netflix see what's new on there and then I'll go over to the actual movies and TV and see what's new to rent most notably like recently I just rented Gods and Monsters from there because I'd much rather give Sony money than Comcast I'll just throw that out",

But but I would love to see more original programming come from them, and I would love to see them, you know, utilizing their licenses to make that programming because I think Sony has the leverage to do that, and that's when you start talking, you start getting into a bigger discussion, but like how many properties does Sony have access to that would make some TV shows or awesome Netflix shows or awesome HBO shows if they could do that style of content? I mean they could - they have that audience, that is, they're utilizing their console in interacting with it every day for hours on end, that's not even like what Netflix has.",

Okay so what do you think about this? I don't know it sounds cool, I mean I just don't think if there's some functionality that they need to add the problem that we're going to start running into I think and this is a problem that was with PS3 and Xbox 360 as well but so it might not be as extreme but it might be over the years is these consoles still have a very limited power range that they can really explore and a limited amount of print is very limited in the sense of what they",

Don't know how to turn the system off. Guys, turn it off, unplug it. Waka wait, it still starts beeping yeah she's doing stuff in a life stolen and like you plug it back here, you get a \"Hermes\" - a positive, it's like, \"Hey, **** you didn't turn this off the correct way,\" and I'm disappointed with you, in like a dad. This is that okay, yeah exactly. Um, what's interesting about that is uh I was a PS3 guy last gen right, 360 so whenever I use someone's 360 I was like \"lost\" but the cross media bar made sense to me, but I think that's because I'd used it on the PSP right, used on the PS3 so I'm just like",

I understand if I'm turning the system off, go to the left, go up, right - it was muscle memory. Games, you know? At least it kind of broke it down going now it's way more of a Windows 8 style tile thing on both PlayStation and Xbox. On Xbox, I like that design now. And I actually didn't know a lot of people had invested in the Xbox One as much as they have, but when I remember distinctly when 360 went from the blading structure to that more tile structure, I was like, \"this makes a lot more sense.\" Now I can understand where my content's grouped and how it's grouped. And I only have like four or five main screens where I can just kind of shift through, and that's where my apps are. Cool - can I access my apps right there?

And so, yeah, I mean it's it's a little little confusing, a little clutter for me even when I pop in a game and I'm like \"where are the three games\" like that are listed on my cross media bar, like I don't understand that, like should that just be its own category where games that I've played?
