But other than that, I uh, I still can't get over how bad it is. What is the unlocking system? You have to play the game for 9 days to unlock everything, and it doesn't matter if you've sunk in like 5 or 10 minutes or 10 hours in one day - you unlock the same amount of stuff. So it's like there are all the tools and different assets you can use to create levels, and they didn't want to overwhelm players in the beginning by putting everything there. Uh, I mean, but it's like why? Because players are stupid? Like yeah, I mean well, yeah - it's like the difference between Microsoft Paint and Adobe Photoshop.

I don't think you can really appreciate going back unless you are willing to do the work, MH. I mean that's my take, I don't know if you guys agree but I think it takes work, it's not all definitive, I mean that's completely accurate, but so going from it you got the NES and SNES and then there's the jump to the 3D consoles, so then in that era I feel like there's much less games that you have to play because they're more similar to contemporary games, that's true, and I also would say that I think this is when genre becomes really important, your preferences become more important as time goes on because yeah PS1 N64 to a degree but not nearly the degree of PS1",

Because this is a seminal role-play... let's take all of that stuff out of it, like what are just the games that people need to play because even NES, it's like giving them Zelda. Like if they don't like that type of game, they're not going to like it. Sure I agree with what you're saying but I do feel like on N64, like it would be easy to get into, like all right I play Mario 64, but if you're not into 3D platformers then who the **** cares?

I understand what you're saying, but that is a semantic issue in terms of like Limbo just can't run on a Vita unless it's been modified because it's just these are just totally different pieces of hardware. I'm telling you the point, and that's why PlayStation Now made sense because PlayStation Now was scalable, and that was what they were trying to do - PlayStation Now could be scaled to PS4 and PS3 and Vita, you know, and then use like cloud processing to play the games or beam them to your system.

No, Secret of Evermore is an SNES game, that was an N64 game, that Square now owns. Secret Evermore is a great game too. Um, but I feel like Mana did come back, Legend of Mana - that series did come back, so I don't know. Oh you're right, yeah. Um, so why do they not do these things? I think there's just they have to balance it, the you know they have they have their tent pole series, what Eastern series they have Final Fantasy and they have Dragon Quest and they're going to continue to focus on those now they're also doing Star Ocean, so that's like kind of an A-tier not a triple-A tier A-tier thing I think that they're kind of throwing because I'd love to see them bring back Bravely Default, I'd love to see them bring back The Bouncer and Stu, like that but they're just not going they're not.

That's what I'm doing, Kevin, so shut up. I don't understand this. So there's Xenogears and then there was Xenosaga right, one two and three yeah on PS2 right right are those connected? I don't I don't know because I didn't play them. I played I bought Xenosaga which had some German name I don't remember it was like some ridiculous name oh yeah and uh I played it and I bought it so I bought it when I was in college I think it was a freshman in college and I put it in and it was like an hour later and like I still couldn't play it I'm like I'm out",

I don't I don't know, I don't know that they're I don't know that they're necessarily connected because then there's like you know not that it comes from the same company but you know there's a lot of Zenoblade, The Chronicles, the same now no, they're not they're not related. Zenoblade is just Zenoblade, mean yeah, I mean that's the thing you have to you have to look up Xenoblade logo. I'll never forget getting Xenogears in '98, man, I got it for Christmas.

But they run into a wall, I think eventually, where they have to kind of clear out their old stock, and I think something like EarthBound not being released for a while was weird, and there are examples like that. But I think a lot of it now comes down to third parties and third-party cooperation, and they might look at these games and be like, \"You're selling them for five bucks; we might have a plan for Contra in the future, we might have a plan for Blades of Steel, we might have... you know, we can make more money later if we release these games now and then try to release these games again later.\"",
