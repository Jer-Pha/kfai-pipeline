It's a garbage truck that's on fire and it's moving down the street as slowly as a truck can possibly move. So I don't want you to envision something going like 10 miles an hour or anything. It is just barely moving; it's slow enough to ghost ride right. Yeah, no, I mean, you could just go... make a sandwich and do whatever you want. Yeah, say hello to your mom, make a few phone calls, go to work, come back, and it's literally just the next house down. Why do I imagine this at your mob's House in Long Island?

All right, with your first topic, I'll kick it off. First topic comes from the community. Remember if you have topics for me, we've kind of fallen off this a little bit, but I'm going to go back to it if you have topics for the show tweet Nick.

Joe Millionaire - same exact show except the entire premise is that he's a millionaire until the final episode where it's revealed that he's not a millionaire. Yeah, Joe Millionaire was the funniest thing ever. I watched that with my mom actually when I was in college. I would like go to her house on Sundays or Wednesday - I think it was on like Sundays or Wednesdays or something, and I'd be like, \"Hey, can I sleep over at your house so we could just watch Joe Millionaire together?\" All right, so here's the thing: I think Nick hit on a Salon point there.

So the fortunes of that channel hinged on one program, and then became it's the same thing with Comedy Central like Comedy Central was really an afterthought for a lot of people until South Park and The Daily Show came around in the late 90s and really gave people a reason to watch it. I feel like South Park was the first time I watched Comedy Central, yeah, like Comedy Central was just reruns of Half Baked and SNL and all sorts of stuff so it was like you said reruns of Half Baked, yeah, I remember Comedy Central when I was a kid it was that movie was great but I remember it being like the same comedies and all that kind of stuff what came after The Chappelle Show",
