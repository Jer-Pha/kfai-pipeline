The best pair of jeans I've ever had were $200. Save this for the show, it's true. Oh, I'll do it another day, but I mean no, it's too late now we're started. What's up everybody, this is the GameOverGreggy Show. You bought how much did you spend on clothes this weekend? $500, that's awesome. Because you used to say tell me ahead of time, I think when we first moved in, you like every year and a half, like two years, you actually go out and spend a ton of money on lots of money, way more than $500. But now I'm trying to because I because I I buy your wardrobe, your ensemble, and then you just it just is there and then you eventually look at it, you're like I need new clothes, and so I'm trying to be better about like three times a",

I mean, I'm not saying it's always true; I'm just saying generally if you're paying more for something, but there is a threshold where you're paying too much for something. Sure, like Eric always used the example of Eric Castro of uh, you know, like something like really high-end, like Blanton's or Eagle Rare, and then you buy something like Pappy. The difference between those is not as extreme as the difference between Johnnie Walker Blue Label and Bulleit. Sure, sure, sure, sure. So there are differences on the low end too.
