Now there's a caveat I have to put to this, which is it's day one of Gamescom when we're recording this right now. So Xbox had its or Microsoft had its press conference this morning; whole bunch of other stuff's going to be happening, but we're just talking about so far, so maybe some crazy stuff happens, but I kind of doubt it's going to yeah. So we're talking about Xbox announced a lot of stuff like there was Scalebound gameplay, Homefront gameplay, Crackdown 3, Halo 5 multiplayer stuff, Quantum Break, Quantum Break battle modes coming to Killer Instinct, Rise of the Tomb Raider demo direct X12 stuff, Halo Wars 2 - yeah, Halo Wars 2, Halo War is probably the biggest announcement, yeah, definitely. And then we got some Xbox One preview program stuff looks awesome like Ark: Survival Evolved - yeah, hell yeah, look I want in on that for sure. And then uh we saw the Chatpad announced which was like does anyone care it was just\"",

It was just weird that it was like a big announcement when I was like oh this wasn't this hasn't been around forever, it's just the Xbox 360's deal plugged into this right? Yeah, that's what I was thinking too, was just like I think I could have sworn this was already existed and it did. So good for them, good on... Oh you're forgetting of course DVR no, I was about to say that DVR which it's on my list, I can't have a goddamn moment. Um backwards compatibility and the games with gold now all the Xbox 360 games of gold were going to be free for Xbox One us and stuff. I mean I you guys talked about it a bit on Colin and Greg live today the whole show yeah but I mean for people that didn't watch it live thenks and I didn't listen so I don't know what do you guys think cuz like just from me watching it from me",

You know, I mean, I started thinking about that when I was watching this. What if Scalebound had a show? What if you had a show for Halo, like a real, long-running show that could have been going for years, as opposed to just these tentpole kind of things? When you do things that make sense, in other words, making these IPs something bigger than just the game. Which Sony hasn't been able to do with Uncharted, right?

I think Microsoft's Phil Spencer is a smart dude, and December 2016 says Google so that means 2016 because that game's not gonna come in December um quarter for 2016. Sayed so October November, I feel like Microsoft well not Microsoft Xbox was so ill-managed under the previous leadership that it needed someone with balls and conviction and knowledge to come in and fix it, and he did and he is, and I think that he deserves a lot of credit for that because Xbox One from the get-go was a problem for a lot of people like the way they rolled it out the way they talked about.

You know they played that game with Tomb Raider, you know, like they they played that game with Tomb Raider. Everyone knew it wasn't an exclusive; they finally, Square Enix, admits it, like 18 months later, that it's coming to PlayStation 4. I just want words to mean something right. An exclusive means something; it means it's exclusively on your platform. So when you have a game like Killer Instinct season 3 and you're like Xbox exclusive and on PC, it's like what the hell does that mean? You know what I mean? So there's I feel like you know Quantum Break and these kinds of games are Xbox One exclusives; they are they're not going to be on PC at least that's they haven't said that yet, but I'm concerned for Microsoft and for Xbox.",

And but here's the thing: Street Fighter 5 is going to be published by Sony and it will be on PC, so they're maybe starting to do the same thing with their own games, but they haven't done it yet. But I say this because I think that's what's helping Sony - it's saying like we really can only play these games here; there's no chance we have no history of doing anything else, so we're not messing around, you know? Like if you want to play this game, you're going to play it here or you're not going to play it at all, you know. And but I think that's the thing with something like Halo Wars 2 - like I don't think there's a overwhelming majority of people that are like 'I'm going to buy a system for that game.' The guys that are like 'Oh, it's coming to PC now; I guess I'll play it.'\"",

And it seems like that might not be the biggest concern for them. Indeed, some of these suggest that it's not the biggest concern. But the biggest games - the biggest games that they have, with the exception of Halo, which I think is PC concurrent; no, I mean I'm not positive about Halo 5, but at least in the past, Halo has always been \"comes to PC\" way later. So, so that's a good point, at least Halo 1 and Halo 2 - I don't even think the other Halos came to PC, so that's a good thing to know then. Because my point was, is that to their credit, Microsoft's credit, the biggest of the biggest games",

These are kind of more A and B tier games that you know, like no one really cares about Far Cry Legends. So yeah, put it on PC, it doesn't really matter. Um, Halo Wars, you know, that kind of game caters to PC audiences. And it's the weirdest thing about Halo Wars is who's making it, which is Creative Assembly. And this is when things get really weird, because Creative Assembly is owned by Sega, they're making a Microsoft-published exclusive with their biggest IP, and I was like, \"This is weird.\" Like, this is things are getting weird now in a good way. Now studios are starting to work with each other and getting stuff out that showed me was that if they can tap into the Sega stable, what's stopping them tapping into someone else's",

What's stopping them from tapping into you know one, you know one of these great studios that you would have never in a million years guessed that that would happen, you know so but Sega is just hurting. They're that's what it comes down to. Ubisoft's going to be like no we can sell more by putting it on every platform unless you're going to offer us a boatload of cash to get us you know exclusively. So overall man I don't know if Greg's opinion differs, I'm I was left impressed by Microsoft's press conference they had no competition at the show they're so that helps them but I don't think even if I think even if they had competition there's a healthy chance they probably would have won yeah you know in quotes um but the cards are on the table now.",

Um, so you know Microsoft's going to be all the chatter right now, Colin and Greg live today was all Microsoft news, um, so they want you know they've won the day, they're getting they're being talked about, and then they'll kind of put their games out this fall while Sony's kind of gearing up to get ready for 2016 more imminently. I think Sony has a lot to fear from Microsoft this fall, you know, and if it doesn't pan out for Microsoft this fall in terms of them making some ground and winning October November and December then can anything ever I think that they're just forever at a disadvantage but I don't I think it's going to pan out pretty well for them.",
