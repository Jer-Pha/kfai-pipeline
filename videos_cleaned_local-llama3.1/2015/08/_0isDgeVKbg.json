Yes, we're going to play Rare Replay. I'm excited about this. Me too. Uh, I know you are as well. You're an old-school Nintendo fan. So am I. Rare has been Nintendo or was a Nintendo's DNA forever and then 2002 Microsoft acquired the company. Um, and has done kind of their own thing with them. I like Rare Replay because it celebrates really what people think are the Golden Era and probably the unbeatable era of Rare games which is in the mid-80s and the 90s and obviously early 2000s. Um, so I just want to kind of explore some of these games here on us because to be perfectly honest with you, Rare began for me really with their NES offerings. See you. You go way further back than I do. To me, Rare is GoldenEye and Donkey Kong Country pretty much the two games not on this because of licensing and Nintendo and all that stuff but I didn't even know",

These are very rudimentary uh kind of arcade style arcade game came out in 1983 uh you can play with one or two players with only one controller so you're supposed to grab rocket parts and fuel to assemble your spaceship and then you fly away. So I'm going to I'm just going to start a new game we'll just start just to show people what it's all about and so I'm reading here uh these games came out for like Sinclair ZX Spectrum uh Amstrad CPC BBC Micro MSX of course which you guys have around and then the Commodore 64. So depending on the game we're talking about, these were that was what they were all about those consoles all sound like if someone just put their hand on a keyboard oh God I that so the the cool thing about uh about this I think well the cool thing",

Yeah, that was such a thing back then. I remember having so much fun in Mario 2. Not that that was the first game to do it, but that's the one that I remember the most. And the first level when you're like dropping and like trying to see how many times you can loop well, and it always you know like like just a lot. It was it was you know useful to you in in strategically to do things like that. Old you know Pac-Man is a great example. Um so I'm gonna be patient here and to to to fly up is this something I can grab presumably yep. Um it looks like a slime, like an enemy that might have um here you go are you fueled up? Oh there's like gold and we'll just get one more of these here. I'm just going to stand over here. Thrilling gameplay.

This is awesome, this is what we've always wanted: where they can go back and put achievements and trophies on old games like old NES games, and this is kind of the way you do it. I know it's hard to do um because you know it's not within the code of the game and stuff like that, but nonetheless, that's what it's all about. We'll go back uh so that - so we played Jetpac with no K. Yeah, oh what is this Snapshots or Bites? Oh, this is the I see, I see; this is for my Snap... oh now we're just in Snapchat or Snapshot.
