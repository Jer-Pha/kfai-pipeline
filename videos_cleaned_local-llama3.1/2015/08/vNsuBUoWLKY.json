And this will be for anyone out there who hasn't seen it, too. Again, it's on Netflix. Go see it. Um, the big innovation that they did with Columbo was it wasn't a murder mystery. They actually showed you the murder - they showed you the murderer committing the murder at the beginning of every episode. So it was no mystery to the audience who had committed the murder and why. You saw it all up front and then Columbo, who was an LAPD homicide detective played by Peter Falk, would show up sometimes not until like 15-20 minutes into the there - actually they were 90-minute episodes",

It was a 90-minute, really a feature-length film, each episode's basically a feature length film that once you add the commercials it plays over the course of like two hours on television. So it was on from like 8 to 10 or whatever every Sunday. Not every Sunday, but every few Sundays. They didn't do it weekly, but the first ones they had all that time. The first 15 minutes of the show was just setting up the crime. And like you would see the guy commit the murder or the woman, whoever it was, and then you would see all the clever ways in which they had covered their tracks and basically made this murder unsolvable.

So the mystery the fun of the show is not trying to figure out who the murderer is. It's watching Columbo engage in this battle of wits with the murderer to break him down and find the faults in his story and figure out and eventually nail him. And they would always have this moment at the end of the show called a gotcha where Columbo would trick the guy, yeah. He would like reveal he would reveal how he had done one more thing, yeah.

So he's so unassuming and it's actually a role it's a part that he's playing that the Columbo detective is basically playing the part of a guy who's not very smart.

And he pretty much knows who the murderer is like from minute one. And it's just a question of how he's going to prove it. And here's the other great thing about it and why it's such an interesting historical artifact is that each week the murderer was played by a really big star like Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner, Johnny Cash, John Cassavetes, um Robert Vaughn, all these great stars of the era like the 70s and '80s would play the role like they were the guest star every week.

It's just delicious to watch the Johnny Cash episode. I mean, they just got everyone. And I think like today you would get like George Clooney and like the big stars of today would come in, and it's just a huge amount of fun to do it. And Mark clearly is the guy to do it.

There's no doubt Colombo is one of those one of those great shows. Um and it has a very storied place in American TV history.

But often times with these the difficulty is often when you know at some point there's there is somewhere at in Universal City at NBC there's a guy who has like the Columbo rights sitting in a drawer not necessarily literally but figuratively this is the guy that says yes I give you the keys to Columbo and that's the guy you have to convince and until you can convince that guy nothing gets done.

And it really is like, in talking about and thinking about it, cuz I had not really thought about Columbo in a long time, where it's like, yeah, the quirky character in Monk - Monk is OCD, and he's a nut job, right? And like, everyone knows he's really smart, but no one trusts him, and he's just a crazy dude who solves the crime. They show it in the beginning of the episode, although they don't show who did it, and they proceduralized Columbo with that - I think in some respect, 20% there, not 100%, but it just reminded me of that.

Getting smarter and they're growing to learn how to understand. So, their signing process was a lot better this year. So, they actually like scheduled a lot more people and they had a structure to waiting in line to be able to guarantee that these people can meet the people they're looking forward to meeting. And that's kind of what my topic was is I'm watching these people wait in line to go say hi and like meet and greet these, you know, YouTube celebrities or not even they're not even saying YouTube's not even fair cuz it's like there's Vine celebrities and Instagram people and Snapchatters now and like all this I don't know if they're called Snapchatters u but whatever whatever there you go snappers snappers.",

Like back in the day, I would like I remember my brother was super into WWE and like when people would come like we'd wait I'd bring him and wait in line for hours to meet these wrestlers and like that didn't seem ridiculous to me, you know?

When I was a kid in the early '80s, I would watch, I don't know if it was everything here, but in the UK, we had a show called The Young Ones, which is kind of an anarchic comedy show. I think MTV had it here for a while, and it was like very much at the forefront of like very kind of gross out, just silly slapstick comedy. And it was a huge hit on BBC television. And it's very popular with kids of my age, like teenagers. And my dad would look at it and go, I don't get it at all.

What I've noticed as well is if you look at the kind of content that I'm trying been trying to educate myself about this I I did a show I did a YouTube show last year with Skybound. I was so I was trying to figure out like who the audience was and trying to learn like how long the show has to be and who the audience is for this thing. What was that? What was called NerdCore?

I think it was episode five, Mario vs Sonic. Yep. You had the warp zone. We had you did the Super Mario Bros. Super Show dance routine at the end, which is amazing. Anyway, you look I was talking to someone about this and said, \"So, okay. So, what kind of content is on there?\" I said, \"Well, like some of the really popular ones are like the teenage girl who likes makeup tips or like here's dating tips for girls and like here's, you know, fashion stuff and you know, here's like celebrity gossip.\" And what I realized is that this is not necessarily the new television, it's the new teen magazines.

But with this added dimension of like some level of interactivity where you know they these these these YouTube stars can do videos going hey you know I like your comments whatever you feel like you can kind of this is why I think it's so virulent is that sense that like you kind of know them a little bit and you're like internet friends with these people because the you know the the two-way communication allows that is that people get really really into it um in a in a way that I think transcends anything we we saw in you know television or any of the old media.

And and like I said, when we when we went there four years ago, I kind of had a firm in my brain, I had a firm understanding of what a celebrity or a star was versus what someone on the internet was, right? I'm like, \"No, these people aren't stars. Four years ago, I would have told you that they're not stars. No way. These aren't stars.\" But then you start to break it down. You're like, \"Well, what does that mean?\" Well, all of them have a huge audience. All of them are treated like stars when their when their their fans see them. like they're they want to elevate them to that status and they're making a lot of money.

There's an added level of intimacy. Yeah, even with a massive audience that you don't get yeah with television. And again, the crazy thing is these people are earning real real money.

Yeah, we saw we saw that a couple years ago. They started the panel started going from like how to grow your audience and how to like what what monetization means to we started seeing panels of like what does representation mean? And it was like so and so from CAA and so and so from UTA and so and so from William Morris and I was like oh wow these people are there's a huge huge huge push to use these kids for a for their influence and b as sort of I mean I think they're still trying to figure out but there's a lot of money to be made",

Um, and I think to to a lesser extent, you know, it's it's true of, you know, people in the entertainment business. They don't necessarily have to understand it in order to package it and monetize it. There's a again, we see this all the time. I mean, there was a British YouTube celebrity, I think she may be referring to Zoella (Zoe Sugg), but like a teenage girl who built a huge following. She now has a she had",

Part of the reason why there's a rush to monetize this is that nobody really knows how long it's going to last. So some of these YouTube celebrities could have very short, you know, lifespans. We we now live in a world where one of the dominant forms of media is 6 seconds long. So you want to talk about like the contraction of attention spans and how long you might have in the spotlight before the next cool kid comes along.

And I a couple years ago at VidCon, we saw this whole thing Nick's talking where it's like representation and all this. And you started to see the beginning of like what happened with all the boy bands and stuff where it's just this produced thing where people put people together and like made a product out of these people and kind of sold it that way. You started seeing a bunch of YouTube networks and channels and shows and whatever, and personalities that weren't really personalities. It's not like they came started doing YouTube channels.

But this year I saw a bunch of those people that were introduced a couple years ago and they've now been pretty much saying **** you and just doing their own thing. And it's like they got brought up that way, but then they learn quickly. And I think that's the the most interesting part of this is even with all these young kids, they're not only are they getting a lot more money a lot earlier and having a lot more weird responsibilities, they're given the opportunity to think and use them, use all the tools available to them in such unique weird ways that they can kind of say, \"We don't need you.

Is that before, prior to this, you needed a label or studio to elevate you as a celebrity, right? And you needed their continual support in order to keep your celebrity. Whereas now, the dangerous thing is if you build up a bunch of people who get massive followings, they don't necessarily need to stay within your organization. They can go out on their own, do their own thing, and still enjoy success and still thrive. And so I think a lot of people are trying to figure out in that ever-changing landscape how do how do we capitalize off people and not drive them out and and not let like let them go because I mean there's a lot of power to the individual contributor these days.

And we again we've seen it ever since the golden age of Hollywood child stars that kind of went off the rails because they just weren't properly prepared or properly protected by those around them. And I wonder if there is a new generation. I think there already is a new generation that we've seen in the last couple years and that's the viral hit. like people that just make one video, they get millions of views and they get millions of fans and stuff for that one video and then nothing after that and they they can't follow up and they don't have consistent content or they then put out content and no one cares about and everyone's like, \"Oh, just do that again.

He he pioneered what I believe is now known as in Apple the Ken Burns effect where you would take it all all he would have is archivally a still photograph but he would move the camera into it to give you at least a sense of like motion as you were watching a movie. Genius. And a little bit of noise in the background too. I can't I cannot tell you how many projects I've done where I've been sitting on the other end with like a creative director or someone who's like you know from an agency and they go so we'll just do this and we're just going to use the Ken Burns effect",

Didn't know if they made it across. They talk about a gentleman named Winston Churchill once or twice in the documentary. Doesn't ring a bell. Uh, so anyway, I'm I'm watching this and there's a moment in the documentary that really stuck with me and I don't think it was a consequential part of the documentary at all, but they're talking about when Theodore Roosevelt takes over for McKinley after McKinley is assassinated and Teddy Roosevelt's coming in and he goes through his business and then he chooses Taft as his replacement when he doesn't decide to run in 1908 and Taft comes in and when the story goes that they're building at the White House, the West Wing at that time and the Oval Office.",

It was burned down by the British and all this kind of **** But it's it's been a building, but the West Wing and specifically the Oval Office has taken on this really significant this significant position in American politics, in American history, right?

It's become harder because they passed these laws now. Like Nestle and these other guys don't want you to realize that American chocolate is inferior.
