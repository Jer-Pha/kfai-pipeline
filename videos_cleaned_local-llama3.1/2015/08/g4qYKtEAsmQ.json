Live Events is definitely as weird as it sounds, back as it sounds is the next evolution in like online content creation, sure. Uh, and it goes back to kind of what Tim was saying earlier, it's like we made stuff that we thought was funny and we thought surely there's other people think it's funny. Guess what, those people also want to meet each other. Yeah, that's why these Live Events are so great is that you're bringing people together and making individual connections outside of just increasing a little odometer on YouTube.
