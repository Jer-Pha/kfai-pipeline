Now, before we get into it, the reason I'm bringing this up is I was thinking I was in bed last night and I was just thinking about it. I'm like, \"Huh, I've never gotten the answer to this.\" Is that a slow jerk? Yeah, I was slow jerking it thinking about I speed up the slow jerk for the podcast. I just want to make sure. Slow jerk. Four strokes a minute. Maybe we strokes a minute. Yeah. To the point where you're almost 15 seconds. You're almost getting soft. Yeah. We decided that if you're not almost getting soft, you're not doing it right. Damn. I like that. It's like when you stew beef, you know what I mean? You got to just keep it there for a real long time. So, I looked it up on Wikipedia and I I just Googled Chicken or the Egg and there was a Wikipedia link",

So, I looked it up on Wikipedia and I I just Googled chicken or the egg and there was a Wikipedia link about it, right? I started reading it and I'm like, \"Oh my god, we need to talk about this.\" So, there is a definitive answer, right? So, go the Chicken or the Egg causality dilemma. Apparently, that's a thing is commonly stated as which came first, the chicken or the egg. To ancient philosophers, the question about the first chicken or the egg also evoked the questions of how life and the universe in general began. From a modern scientific perspective, the chicken egg came first because the genetic recombination that produced the first chicken, though that may be an arbitrary definition in a breeding population undergoing speciation, I don't know speciation occurred in germline cells in a non-chicken ancestor. Another literal answer is that the egg in general came first because egg laying species",

Another literal answer is that the egg in general came first because egg-laying species predate the existence of chickens. To others, the chicken came first, seeing as chickens are merely domesticated red jungle fowls. Duh. Shit's getting fun. Everyone knew that. Cultural references for the chicken and the egg intend to point out the futility of identifying the first case of a circular cause and consequence. The metaphorical view sets a metaphysical ground to the dilemma. To better understand its metaphorical meaning, the question could be reformulated as which came first, X that can't come without Y or Y that can't come without X. Well, how do they spell \"come\"? It's an important I like how you ask question science class. Ask X. Going to give it to you, Nick. going to give us the egg.

It is a philosophical question. But that's **** though, man. They're talking about chicken eggs and you goddamn know it. Well, my whole argument like so when I think when I think about this question, there is an answer. I I think the answer definitively is the egg, right? I mean, that's that's but because the the egg would hatch the chicken the first in other words, the chicken can't be the chicken without the egg that it came out of. My original argument when I first thought about it when I was younger and I was talking about a little bit with Kevin today was the chicken must lay the egg and therefore the chicken came first.

The Chicken was the chicken but with three eyes. So, it wasn't a chicken yet, right? Sure. And it laid the chick, it laid an egg with the chicken with two eyes, which is the chicken we know today, and it hatched. So, the egg therefore came first. That's the way it has to go. You know what I mean? In other words, the Chicken couldn't have been spawned from another Chicken because the Chicken didn't exist yet. Therefore, the Chicken couldn't have come first, you know? So, I I think I hear what you're saying. I'm with you. So, but I but it's a but it's not so much that's they get into in the Wikipedia article is that it's really not about Chickens at all.

It talks a lot about evolution, natural, you know, natural selection, which is fascinating stuff. And how I've been reading lately about um about things with with different animals that are identical, but have but but genetically spawned at two different points in natural selection, which is so **** interesting to me. So, for instance, not that this is the example, but like let's say two creatures could see, right? But like they didn't they didn't spawn from the same genetic code. Like in other words, they didn't come from the same tree um of that particular thing in natural selection. So they just both adapted sight independently.

You're talking about the Stone Age, but not like if you go way back and you think about the, you know, Neanderthals are not human beings, you know, and Cro-Magnon branch that kind of that kind of spawned off of the same common ancestor of what was human.
