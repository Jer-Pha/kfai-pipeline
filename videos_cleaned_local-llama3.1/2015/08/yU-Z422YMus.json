And all that stuff. Are you being facetious or did this really happen? No, it's been... I don't know if you guys saw. I guess I was tagged a lot because I was the one that technically... I muted Mike Bithell in volume game. Don't do that. No, it's a total joke. So volume... Give me my goddamn code though, Mike. Oh, he's gonna get it. It's gonna be good. Because the game, it's a stealth game coming August 18th to PlayStation 4, PS Vita, PC and Mac. The creator of Thomas Was Alone. Volume combines the core story... Wow.

I've seen him respond to a lot of them. Yeah. First responder. Is he? Is that what that term means? I think that's what that term meant. You're really good at responding on Twitter? Yeah.

Ultimate Play The Game dudes. They'll figure it out. I'm gonna get it right now. Ranging from that all the way through that there's NES games, there's SNES, there's N64, Xbox One games? Yeah, I guess there is. And 360 games on that business. Yeah. And um... That's a good compilation. They got a whole bunch of good stuff on there. It is. It is. Perfect Dark. Banjo Kazooie.

Then Wednesday is going to be all the NES games except for Battletoads. Because Thursday is Battletoads. Oh, Battletoads gets its own thing because are you going to beat it? Are you going to beat it one sitting? Are you going to beat it with one life? No way. You should have seen me playing some of these games. I was like, Jesus Christ. Like the ultimate play of the game, whatever the fuck it was called, games. I had never even heard of these games.

Like the, or not Solar Jetman, because Solar Jetman was the NES game. There was a... Something other than... Lunar Jetman. And I was, oh, I was competent at a couple of the games, pretty terrible at most of those early, you know, those like Commodore games or whatever the fuck, you know, they were running on at the time. Not my finest moment, but we went through each game. We only played each for like two or three minutes at the most. Then the NES ones we played Slalom, which I was very good at.

It's been a long time, you know? But we used to get to show them all off, which is cool. So people kind of introduce themselves. I gotta be honest, man, because I know what we're talking about. Rare Replay is such a great value. Oh, yeah. It really is. Now, what's cool to me about this, the reason I decided to make this a topic today is I feel like they nailed it in a way that I can't remember any other compilation of games nailing it. The presentation is on fleek, as the kids say. What's this face, Greg? I feel like you're forgetting about the Sega Genesis collection, which isn't a joke. That one that we all platinumed on the",

Yeah, but this presentation is like, it's real next level. It's real good. Explain to me what's so great about it. Well, what's great about it, I think that they nailed it in many different ways that are very interesting to me, because a lot of these games I'm not interested in at all. So many of them are so old and so just like, ugh. I would never even want it to look at, let alone play. Now, granted, we did a Let's Play of them where the point was playing through all the ones we don't necessarily want to play, but the presentation of the games makes you interested in the history.

They do a good job of presenting the history of Rare, how you go through all this stuff, and they entice you to play it with all their different modes and stuff. So there's this thing called Snapshots. I think that's what it's called. It's not Snapchat. Yeah, it's something like Snapshots. Snapshots where they take bits of the game, like the bit that everyone thinks of with that game, and they have you play through it, and they kind of change up the mode. For example, in Battletoads, one of the Snapshots is the speeder bike level, but it's more of an endless runner instead of being the level you can actually be. So it's more of a face off against your friends, see how far you can get thing. I like that. I went back and thought, what made this game special? What are memorable? What does the thing people think of when",

What does the thing people think of when they think of this game? Let's expand on that a bit. In addition to that, the borders around the games are beautiful, and they took a lot of the original artwork from the box art or from whatever and kind of put it around, because a lot of these games are 4-3. And a lot of the times when I see this stuff, I remember back with the Super Game Boy, they did this, and it got in the way. It never looked that good, and it was always just kind of distracting and shit. This one too, it does have some things that aren't exactly perfect. Like there's modes, we didn't do this in Let's Plays, but I was watching YouTube videos. You can change it so that you get the weird CRT scan lines and all that stuff. That gets a little gimmicky, but I like the options there. But I feel like all the stuff we did",

But I feel like all the stuff we did with the borders and all that, and there's just trivia about the games, and there's a lot of information. It's kind of like going on Wikipedia as you're playing the games, which is cool. You know how many players are in it, what the plot of the game is, if there is any. There's little facts and stuff. So this is a really... I had to look it up, because I can only remember Final Fight. Do you remember Final Fight Double Impact? And it came with the magic sword. I reviewed this game, by the way. I can only remember Final Fight. But it was the same thing, where it was so well done of trivia, and if you wanted to play it, you could make it look like the arcade cabinet.

But what I like about it is that, and I've seen other compilations do those things, those little tricks, but what's cool about this is that it all kind of melds together. There's an aesthetic to Rare Replay itself. It's like this whole theater thing, and we skipped this too, but there's a weird intro cutscene thing where they really present it kind of like a super wacky musical thing, which is very reminiscent of Rare, of Banjo-Kazooie, of things like that. But overall, it's just like playing it, I'm like, man. There was a lot of love put into this. Is this the best compilation of all time? I mean, no, because Super Mario All-Stars",

I mean, no, because Super Mario All-Stars exists. But it's damn good. And I think what's really cool about it is, I'm saying this not even based solely on the quality of the games. The games that we played, they weren't good, most of them, if any of them. Well, some of the NES ones were good. But the pre-NES games, they were distracting, if anything. There was so much color. And it wasn't even music, it was just sounds. What did I describe it as? Just a cacophony of noise. It was very colorful. That's the thing I remember us talking about the most, was the aesthetic, the palette was very colorful. I think that it might be the most impressive collection I've ever played, because what was very unvogue on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 was releasing old games, kind of putting a border around them, maybe a little bit",

And then you just kind of go about your business, you play the game. They don't typically hold up as well as you remember, as is the case with Rare Replay, and then you move on. I think what's really cool about Rare Replay, what is so impressive, there's multiple things, is that, A, it's priced really appropriately. It's 30 games for $30. I think that's really, really cool. And I'm not entirely positive that they're going to be making money on this collection, because it's not going to sell that well. They had to put a lot of time into it, and porting these games over and QA-ing them. This seemed like a labor of love. This seems like something that they needed to do, because Rare has fallen so far from grace that the only thing you can really do at this",

I don't care about the things they're making now, it's just like they're not going to recapture this essence, because none of those people are here anymore. So they're working on Yooka-Laylee and all these other games. I really appreciate that. I do appreciate the unified aesthetic and the challenges. There's a fucking bajillion achievements attached to these games. It's cool to see not a lot of studios have this chronology that you can follow from beginning to end that is that impressive, when you really sit down and think about it. Rare is really one of the few studios that really has a chronology that's that long and uninterrupted. One of the weird things to me is seeing some of",

I see this as an N64 game, like why is this on Xbox One? But it's there and it's cool. And I think it's a really, again, a labor of love. This goes back to what Microsoft's been doing, I think, which is just they're doing a lot of things right. And they own Rare. They realize that people largely like Rare as a complete shell and that it's not Rare anymore and it isn't. So yeah, you celebrate those old times. And I think that that's really cool. And I think it's just so strange going back and playing these games. There's games that are missing that I'm curious why they're missing, like Wizards and Warriors is a huge example, which I think they made by themselves. But I don't know if there's some",

But I don't know if there's some sort of collaboration. My assumption is that Nintendo published that game. But nonetheless, I think it's really cool to kind of follow them from the embryonic kind of zygote and all the way to what they really became. And they really hit their stride in 2000, 2001, I think, before Microsoft bought them when they basically ruined them. So it's fun. And I actually think in terms of volume, it is the best collection that I've ever seen. In terms of quality of games and the games I want to play, yes, Super Mario All-Stars is, of course, probably with the winner. Mega Man collection is probably going to be up there, too. Even the obscure Ninja Gaiden collection on Super Nintendo. There's a lot of collections out there. I was digging through it online there while you were talking. I couldn't",

When you beat, you hit milestones in games, it would unlock, like it unlocked, you know, like when you played the NHL game and unlocked the Phil Hartman commercial that you can go watch in their archives and stuff. I want to say it was on PlayStation 2. It might have been PS3, but there's a million different compilations out there, that kind of stuff. That's cool. Like anything that embraces the nostalgia of like, this is more than just the games. It's talking about the time of the game, showing you things from then. I like that. Yeah, it's great.

It looks like the evolution where there's like the monkey turning. Oh, sure. Sure. It was that it was like all the characters from Rare. And it's like, that's cool. And like you unlock videos and commercials and all that stuff. And what's interesting to me about this is I came into Rare very late in the game compared to you because like I didn't know any of these things.

That awesome N64 run. And then all that stuff. So for the key Rare games for me to not be in this collection and for me to still look at it and be like, oh, this is cool, is very interesting. And I like it because the presentation made me interested in their history more than the games did because like Lunar Lander or whatever the hell it's like, wow, these are not cool. But I had fun going through them. And I feel like that's kind of a very key thing for compilations to get right is to make you want to play the games you don't want to play.

And then if you like it, then go and play it. Maybe there's an element there. And then there's another thing that was really cool is seeing all these old games and being like, oh, wow, like this sucks. But this aspect of it, like there's a day night cycle in this.

You can see like, yeah, like a day night cycle, for instance, in a game that was made in 1983 and 1984. It's pretty cool and really pretty unheard of. So yeah, it's cool to kind of go back through the genetics of a studio like that. And again, there's just not many ways to do it with studios that a lot of studios are not including the games that they made. That studio is like 32, 33 years old, including the pre-Rare kind of days. And it's just, it's fun. You know, it's disappointing that you can't get GoldenEye in there and stuff like that and the Nintendo published properties and other things like that.

I mean, that was one of the things we remarked on. One of the videos was like, man, Rare Microsoft bought Rare 13 years ago. We've really been bitching about this for a very long time at this point. And it's just, it's just crazy how time flies. But again, it's just, it is, it is, it's cool to see companies take risks like this or just do cool things for the fans without the expectation of an economic, cause I can't imagine they're looking at this being like charge half as amount of money as we would a normal retailer.

I mean, this isn't an easy and trivial thing for them to do. It's certainly not. So I really think that they did this with the eyes on the fans and that seems to be a common theme with what Microsoft's been doing since the disastrous Xbox One rollout in 2013. So, cause they have to get back on top and I feel like this is a good move for them because what they have with this studio that no one else has is a fucking really old developer. Indeed, the three biggest, the three hardware manufacturers, Rare is the oldest developer in any of those first-party stables and might be there.

But it was cool to be able to celebrate a lineage of a piece of hardware like that, just like Microsoft celebrated the lineage of a specific developer. I hope that others look at this and see like that they can do this. I would love to see what PlayStation or Nintendo can do.

And then I remember when it was Mario's 20th anniversary, right? They released on the Wii and they just, the box is great and all this stuff was great.

A whole bunch of other stuff is going to be happening, but we're just talking about so far. So maybe some crazy shit happens, but I kind of doubt it's going to. So we're talking about, Xbox announced a lot of stuff. Hell yeah they did. There was Scalebound gameplay, Homefront: The Revolution gameplay, Crackdown 3, Halo 5: Guardians multiplayer stuff.

Like I just, I thought it was cool that they were playing it live because I think that's ballsy. A lot of studios don't do that. And they did. Hideki Kamiya got up on the stage and did play it live and I give them a lot of credit for that. But I'm going to wait and see kind of holding pattern.

I don't know if Gears 4 has been definitively said for 2016, but you have to assume it's gotta be. Check it out for me. A lot of this goes back to, overall I'm impressed with what they're doing.

And he is. And I think that he deserves a lot of credit for that because Xbox One from the fucking get go was a problem for a lot of people.

There's issues. People are having issues. But I feel like, and this is what I was alluding to earlier with the use of the word exclusive. Microsoft plays fast and loose with the word exclusive, which has always annoyed me. You know, they played that game with Tomb Raider, you know, like they played that game with Tomb Raider.

So there's, I feel like, you know, Quantum Break and these guys, Scalebound are Xbox One exclusives. They are. They're not going to be on PC. At least they haven't said that yet. But I'm concerned for Microsoft and for Xbox and its ability to come back based on them putting some of these games on PC.

So Fable Legends is really just on Xbox or like these kinds of games are really just Xbox games. But we can sell more games, Y percent more games by putting them on PC on an agnostic platform that really has nothing to do with our competitors. But it is in stark comparison to what Sony does. You're not going to play Bloodborne on PC. You know, I can't think of one Sony Computer Entertainment published game on PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 3 that's playable on PC.

These are kind of more of the A tier and B tier games that, you know, like no one really cares about Fable Legends. So put it on PC. It doesn't really matter.

Because I feel like that was the first game that I can remember that I was really like, holy shit, the environment stuff that's happening at once. It felt like you were playing a cut scene in a lot of ways. Whereas I hadn't experienced anything like that on PS2, you know, and it wasn't just quick time events. It was like what you were doing. You're actually interacting with what felt like a movie. But... Yeah, Modern Warfare was a special game and a really good game. And I also feel like it's a weird thing to say, Modern Warfare came out in what, 2008? It's a weird thing to say, or 2009? No, it was 2008 because it still has that red thing on the box on PS3.

And, um, I feel, so it's a weird thing to say, but I feel like that's when the shooter really arrived. Because it took advantage of what the PS3 and Xbox 360 can do, as well as one of the things I said, which are paradigm shifting, which is like the internet connection. And your ability to kind of sync up with friends. It's not to say that's the first game that did it, it's clearly not. But it was the first game that I felt like that entered the mainstream and made Call of Duty a huge thing. Because Call of Duty existed, Call of Duty 3 was the game that preceded, you know, Modern Warfare.

Call of Duty 2 was that launch game stopgap. And 3 was somewhere in the middle. Sure, sure, sure. I think it's a good choice. I look at, I look at the defining games of a generation. We're not to that point in our timeline yet. Oh sure, yeah. Because when you think about a game like Donkey Kong Country on SNES, not that I'm crazy about that game, but what that game could do on the SNES was not something that Super Mario World even attempted to do in terms of getting the horsepower out of the system.

You have to, like, you have to, almost 10 years after the NES came out, you have to give it time. And so I think when I think about PS3, I think about The Last of Us. You know? Because look at The Last of Us and then look at Resistance: Fall of Man. You know what I mean? Resistance: Fall of Man is like shit. You know? And it's running on the same system.

And I don't think we're there in the timelines yet. I don't think we're going to look at a game like Infamous or Killzone or even Bloodborne or something like that. And those games are going to have much relevance in the conversation in five years when we realize what the PS4 can do. And so I don't know that we can identify, it's hard to identify a game like that. Yeah, we can talk about GTA III and all those kinds of games, but the jump between PS1 and PS2 was so significant. I'm not saying there was no significant jump between PS3 and PS4 that we realize, like PS3, in its DNA, GTA III and GTA V are not different. But GTA III and GTA II are very different. It's",

It's a logical step, yet that was a bigger jump to me than 64 to Sunshine or Sunshine to Galaxy because we were already there. So you have to kind of wait, in my opinion. But again, it's a tough question because I don't want us to define games based on their power or their graphics or all those kinds of things, but what they do. And you can play a pretty powerful game on an Xbox system. That doesn't mean that it's not worth playing. So I want people to get away from these terms, these buzz terms, that I feel like...

So they were excited about it. My one regret about it is that Superbot Entertainment didn't get a second chance at it because I would have liked to see what they could have done with it. Had",

But the beauty of it, and I think that this is what you're kind of alluding to with Super Smash Bros., which I think is Super Smash Bros. is not only a game that makes a lot of money, it's a gateway drug to a lot of people that don't know a lot of these characters.

And I was playing Second Son waiting for 15 hours for Cole to show up at the very end. I'm like, yes, it's going to be Cole. Like, Augustine's gone. It's going to be Cole. Augustine was a great villain, but I was like, it's going to be Cole. And then Digging In Your Sends, I'm like, you have to be fucking kidding me. You know what I mean? Like, why is he in All Stars? Yeah. Nonetheless, I digress. Ladies and gentlemen, this has been episode 31 of the Kinda Funny Gamescast. Tim Gettys, Colin Moriarty, Greg Miller, and Video Games.
