That was the first time ever that one of Nick's \"you know\" falling forward things worked; it went down real fast, but you got it right back out. That was so good. This is something that we've talked about pretty often on GamesCast and on Colin and Greg Live about specifically in relation to esports and how I just hate that term. I hate it. It's not to disparage again the people that play those things or do that; I just hate that it's \"sports.\" I just don't like that it's Competitive Gaming, that's great, it's hard, it takes skill, congratulations if you do it; I'm happy for you have no problem with that um a lot.",

Have no problem with that. Um, a lot of people look at the definition of sports and I don't even want to look at it because that's not really what we're talking about like what the definition of sports is. Of course, chess is considered a sport by the Olympic Committee for instance. By the way, at the end of this, I just want to rattle off as many sports as I can think of; it'll probably only be three and I want you to tell me whether or not they're sports okay. The end that's fine, that's fine. So to me, and I don't know if you guys agree like I don't, I just think that the term sport is used loosely. I think that there are certain prerequisites for sports, and if something's not considered a sport it's not necessarily it's not at all an insult to that activity; it just means that it's not a sport, you know, and and I just think",

You know, and I think sometimes, like, the word \"literally\" is a good example: literally means something, and it was used wrong for so long now that the dictionary reflects the totally wrong usage of the word. Now, \"literally\" doesn't mean literal anymore; you don't know, like they've changed that, and that really bothers me. So I want to get back to a point where words mean something, and to me, a sport needs to be recalibrated in order to reflect the realities of what I think a sport is: it's a competition with a winner and a loser. There's obviously something that doesn't exist in sports that exists in anything \u2013 bowling, you were talking about before, but then it's",

But then it's something I think has to be athletic, and this is where things get murky because this is the example I'll use: do I think bowling is a sport? No, I don't. But there's an amount of athleticism and coordination required to be a top bowler. There's no doubt about that - bowling is tough. People who are good at bowling first of all love it; it's a great thing. I consider you should go bowling one of these days. We absolutely should. I love fun bowling day. The last time I went bowling was with Craig Barret and it was like a long time ago. Was it was it was a lot of fun?

I always use the example like the Olympic Committee considers chess a sport right and I'm like as someone who grew up playing chess and played chess competitively for a while, and is younger years, and really enjoys the game. Chess isn't a **** sport are you kidding me? You know what I mean? Like there's nothing athletic about Chess at all unless you're playing like bullet or Blitz and you're hitting the clock a lot. I mean that's basically it. Yeah, but you get little sweat, you up a little sweat doing that. Little underarm Sweat. I'll tell you story. I used to go sweat when when I was in high school.

Hey Arnold!'s Grandpa, uh... So I used to go to Washington Square Park and play. There was a specific variety of Chess we played called Blitz. Blitz is a five-minute game; typically in a standard game, you might have 90 minutes. So this was like memorization, and I always remember, I'll never forget it as long as I live: my friend was playing this guy, and the guy was winning but his clock was out, but my friend hadn't realized it. And as long as you don't realize it, like the game doesn't end until you call the person out and be like, \"You're out!\" Tip your king over; it's over, and I remember calling him out on it, and the guy...",

Like you don't like that's not your job to tell him that the clock's out or whatever. I'll never forget that as one totally ancillary thing - I still remember that like clear horror. You don't live in the real world **** um so yeah, I used to go but we weren't... we weren't athletes. I used to play against these like crazy dudes that like were really good at chess but they weren't athletic you know? So it's the same thing I was saying about like well if if dexterity or hand skills with your hands or whatever then then cooking is a **** sport and that's where that's where I think like it's it's just not... we we it takes more than common sense, it takes parameters you know and I",
