Now this is a topic I want to talk about it a bit, but I also want to know what do you guys think were the real next gen games going back looking at all the different generations? What were the immediately for me spring to mind is PlayStation 2 and the first ones were GTA III and Metal Gear Solid 2 though for PlayStation 2. I feel like that year went by then it came out, we weren't playing Smugglers Run or Madden or whatever cuz I remember after stopped being blue on the bottom after we got past that first thing I remember not playing anything on PS2 for a long time just watching DVDs on it and doing it and then when GTA and Metal Gear came you're like oh this is this could have",

I think you can make a case for The Witcher as well, but but for me it was Batman that was solidified like this game is beautiful and awesome and it's doing so much different stuff at the same time. This is the first game where I'm like, \"This is next-gen.\" Yeah, I don't know... I I I hate these kinds of questions because like the the the evolution of what is next-gen or expected on current-gen is just an evolution of what has already happened right? Like Mario on NES is a side-scroll, Super Mario World is just a prettier version of Mario. Mario 64 is just a 3D version of the same **** game, like so on and so forth. It's just it's about technical limitations, which is what which is what Greg was saying or whatever. I don't think people like use this term as if we're going to expect some like super crazy experience experience like something different, and the fact of the matter is you're not going to get anything different; it's just",

Think now it's like I feel like Ani Musha is the Batman is the Arkham Knight of where we're at now. Because I still feel like there is something that's going to happen. Oh sure, don't get me wrong, like this is like this is an unfair question of course. Because yeah, uh Metal Gear is going to come out and be probably crazier than Batman, then it'll be Fallout, and what do they have, and then it'll be Uncharted, and like any you can go forward and I mean think, yeah ahead 10 years when we're using these systems and like that the end of the systems obviously will be on to the next one. You'll be like oh my God, I can't imagine D, it's like you know I mean like PlayStation 2, God of War 2, the final thing that really that gas for that system was like holy **** are you kidding me? Yeah, like that's the problem. See it's not that the end of it.",

See, it's not just the end of it though, 'cause it needs to be that way no matter where you go on the thing, I feel like there's another step in the progression for sure. I just don't want to say this particular question is loaded with this, but I feel like when people ask, \"When's the next one?\" Greg was saying like, well, Batman couldn't have been run by a PS3, well, like Killzone Shadow Fall could've been run by a PS3. It's like, are we really looking at games like just that and if we are then we're really not getting anything new? As I've said many times before, you're just going to get games that look like The Last of Us and are as vast as Skyrim put together",

And to me, it's like Dying Light and Witcher are the games that really do that for me. I still don't look at Batman: Arkham as like a truly open-world game because I don't feel like it is open world in the main story, but it's it's I felt still confined and weird, it was like very there was something about it where I was like I don't even really feel like this is any different than Arkham City in a way. It was just a step up though, that's the thing, you know what I mean? The destruction, the Batmobile, the instantaneous nature of it is what I'm talking about. Sure, I understand that, no, I know you do, I'm not arguing with you, I I I feel like I just feel like it's the games are just going to be bigger, you know, I just feel like we're the I was discussing",

Noire for instance it's just a shooter you know like I in other words I wonder if we've already defined everything about no just how we play games and now it's more about extracting horsepower out of the machine to make them more ambitious yeah we're not seeing new genres we're not really seeing anything new in terms of game types or anything like that you know I I I just feel like gen game has never really been about that though because like I mean if you look at those examples because I do you agree that",

And um, I feel so it's a weird thing to say but I feel like that's when the shooter really arrived because it took advantage of what the PS3 and Xbox 360 can do as well as that one of the things I said which are paradigm-shifting - which is like the internet connection and your ability to sync up with friends. It's not to say that's the first game that did it; it's clearly not uh, but it was the first game I felt like that entered the mainstream and made Call of Duty a huge thing because Call of Duty existed; Call of Duty 3 was the game that preceded you know Modern Warfare.",
