I want you guys to fill in the blank and then tell me a little bit about it. All right, this is gonna be a really easy one. Sure, uh, the statement is how can you not like... and so I'm GNA give you my example. Oh okay, how could you not like Seinfeld? That's that's my example. You know, yeah, this is a Seinfeld house we have it on all the time, it's many episodes a day, and when I watch it and I sit down and I and I you know I've seen all these episodes, l i mean literally dozens or scores of times, literally all of them, and you know them by heart, you know what's going to happen in them, and you know you anticipate the",

And I don't feel like a lot of shows are like that. So um because I'm at night I watch a lot of Golden Girls, and I think that that's a great show, but even when I see episodes again, I'm like all right, the humor's lost a little bit if you know the punch line. I watch talk about Dukes and all this other stuff, yeah well that's that's always yeah they're making like really obscure political jokes from 1988 uh and uh you know I've been watching a lot of on Hallmark Channel because I'm 90 uh I've been watching a lot of like Frasier and then I go to Nick and watch a lot of Friends and stuff like that, and I'm like you know these shows are funny they're really they're really fun me in because I feel like we have the",

But Seinfeld is just so special and so when I think when I find someone that doesn't like Seinfeld, like my girlfriend for instance, what are her reasons? And you've never even watched, you don't watch Seinfeld right? My my she she just she just doesn't find it funny, like, and what's weird is she loves Kirby, your enthusiasm, I'm like that's so weird because that's really a show about George in in the in",

Yes, on it was on that docket we went through and that was my question too of like yeah if this one underperforms do you really make that second one but that's Fox having to either bite down and get through this or Fox let's talk to Marvel what do we do. I hope it performs and I hope it performs because when movies, when movie studios like Fox look at their lineup for the next few years they need to be able to account for the fact that this movie is going to make its money back so they can take risks with things like a Deadpool um Deadpool movie.

No, it's an event horizon, not even like there's time dilation in there too; no, not even like an escape. Yeah, time goes way slower down there. For Better or For Worse, but what I realized was I was having discomfort down there when I was shaving too, and I realized you just have to shave with the grain. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And that was something that I had to learn. But I do that specifically because it gives me more time; there is a time in when it grows in almost immediately, and then you just kind of have it for a little while, but it doesn't get out of control yet.
