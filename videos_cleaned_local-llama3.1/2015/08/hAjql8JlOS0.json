You go to kinda funny.com/forums or kinda funny forums.com - it's really your choice; both work at the same place. What's happening to you? I'm being sexy if that's the definition of sexy. Got some issues, yeah. So I also like that this guy's name is SF likes hiking cuz obviously that's Sean Finnan. Sean Finnan likes hi, I'm going to assume that this is Sean Finnan himself, bro. It's definitely not but I hope greetings and salutations everybody. It might be Colin; it's not me. Moonlighting is Sean Fin - I don't know right. This is somebody who was just literally a blank slate before he ran into Kinda Funny content now he's just made himself out of it. A while ago, Greg did the video Persona 4 changed my life. So I was wondering if Colin had a game they felt that way about also if Greg had another game like that, I wouldn't leave him out of it.",

And I'll say too Final Fantasy VII was a really huge game for me um because as a role-playing game nerd growing up and being young and being even young for some of these games, Final Fantasy VII was the moment when I realized it role playing were going mainstream and that was a good thing and I'm happy that it happened. Um and it also was the game that made me get a system like PS1, I wasn't going to go to PS1 I was going to be an N64 person and continue my Nintendo fandom and and that was such a blessing because the PS1 was so so so superior to the N64 and I would have never known if if some of these games didn't hit and then I would have never been introduced to Wild Arms and I wouldn't have been introduced to Tales of Destiny and Thousand Arms.",

Sorry, the game came out 1991, yeah, 24 years uh you know and and that was I was I remember being a kid be like Jesus Christ you know. I mean and that was the game I've told many many times a story about how my brother used to wake me up after I went to bed and I'd sneak into his room and and he would play it together you know and I was like this is there's betrayal in that game and and you know Caine betrays Cecil twice, I mean there's there's",

Like, I didn't know we were just going to play Mario for the rest of my life, and this game was being like, \"No, we have bold things to say and stuff to say,\" you know, and you're going to be mad at the game for killing these characters, although some of them didn't end up really dying, uh, but at the time it's like it's very emotional. And I remember, I remember being like, \"Wow, that that was capable.\" The same thing I was talking about Bioshock; where I was like, \"I didn't know we could tell a story like this,\" you know?
