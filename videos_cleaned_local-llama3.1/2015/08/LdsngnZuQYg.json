Genius, a little bit of noise in the background too. I can't tell you how many projects I've done where I've been sitting on the other end with like a creative director or someone who's like, \"You know from an agency,\" and they go, \"So we'll just do this. We're just going to Ken Burns it.\" And I'm like, \"What does that mean to you?\" Because it means a little bit something different to me.

I was, I worked on the Warner Bros. lot during the final season of The West Wing, and I was constantly trying to get over there; I didn't know anyone who worked on the show, but I was trying to get over there to like see if I could sneak onto the West Wing set, cuz even just the fake version of it would be fascinating.
