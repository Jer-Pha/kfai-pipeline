            "text": "So is there a huge divide in your approach to writing something like a screenplay versus a game? I know I've asked that question a lot to a lot of people, but what I mean is: do you diverge greatly from that three-act structure or does that still sort of remain at the core of any story that you try to tell? In certain instances, you're telling a story that's well beyond the 2-hour storytelling of a movie into maybe a 20- or potentially 40-hour experience, like Fallout. How do you wrap your head around that and where does that even start? Does that mean there are six questions for me to consider? I mean, like, no, it's fine; we've got all day. Um, well, I can start by saying that writing a movie and writing a game are different \u2013 uh, different jobs in different beasts \u2013 but in the same way that writing a comic book and writing a movie are different, and people seem to think that a comic book is a storyboard for a movie, but actually it isn't. And um, and writing...",

And writing television is different than writing a movie, so I feel like every medium is unique in itself. And you know, you need to kind of learn the strengths and avoid the weaknesses. So there's also commonalities - games and movies are visual, first of all. They're visual media. Movies have more in common with games than people would expect. You know, I see a more direct parallel between movies and games than games and theater for example. So there's that, and there's elements that you can bring from games to movies like characters, environment, world building. You know, having to show rather than rely on the thoughts of a character - all those things migrate pretty seamlessly right? And the concept of",

In the game, you're actually going after him physically, but you're participating. If you weren't participating in a movie, you would get bored and you would be texting, and then Colin would be shouting at you. So um, right, yeah, that's about right. So in terms of like the 3x structure, MH, that's like a really big conversation for, um, you know, Aure more than an interview. But basically, you know, there are people in film who will tell you, \"I don't follow the 3x structure. What are you talking about?\" And I'll tell you that right; we followed the three-act structure to the point that the environment was divided into three because we wanted to have a First Act in the frontier, a second act in Mexico, and a third act with a resolution and an epilogue in West Elizabeth, what we called the north back in the day. So um, you know, you can literally...",

So um, you know, you can literally there's different ways to uh skin the cat, but but I guess what you want is structure fundamentally. You you can use uh you know Aristotelian Poetics or the 3-Act Structure or Syd Field whatever you want as long as you kind of have a plan for putting it all together and uh and if the 3-Act Structure works for you, then ultimately the goal is to keep it invisible right and and just tell a good story. Um but but every story has a beginning, a middle, and an end, and that's the 3-Act Structure. So I I know we're going along on this topic, I do want to segue over to sort of I brought I brought him here to talk about stuff like I feel I feel like we can we can just split this into two so that's totally fine. So yeah, I mean so then uh the question is you know when you when you're writing a screenplay right you can take a",

So actually making the movie requires a screenplay; it requires actors, it requires sets, it requires you know so many sound and music that isn't even in the screenplay. And yet sound and music are like so important to a film, um, and even to a game. Something like Manhunt really came together when Craig Conner and his team started putting in the score and the sound effects. It went from this is kind of scary to this is incredibly terrifying and it sounds horrible. So you know it but that's that stuff isn't even on the page. So I guess my way to answer that is that you don't know it until you do it right. You don't know if a game mechanic is going to work until you build it, you don't know if a story beat in a game cut scene is going to work until you're at the very least either pre-visualizing it or shooting it on a performance capture stage and then going that's not.",

Is there some sort of like those aren't that's not art, that's cute. Glad you make games but we make films and is there anything like that or is there kind of an understanding of how important storytelling is in games now and how progressive it is? So I've been in the industry for a while and I can tell you that at the beginning maybe five or six years ago, maybe even a little more, the attitude sometimes was like that. Sometimes um now it's absolutely not right now I every meeting I have and every person I talk to at the very least there is um a sense of interest and respect for uh a form of entertainment and sometimes an art form that is different uh it's meant it's you know not even meant is now in its um you",
