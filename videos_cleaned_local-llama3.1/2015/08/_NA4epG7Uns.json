Now, Colin, you have to assume they're already working on a sequel to The Last of Us. Are yeah uh I think that's pretty obvious um based on comments right yeah and just commercially obvious I think that the commercial imperative is on Naughty Dog to make a The Last of Us 2 because The Last of Us sold extraordinarily well I don't know the exact numbers but I feel like The Last of Us must have sold better than any Uncharted installment any one yeah yeah I see her saying yeah probably um so they're going make another one I mean that's just that's just obvious I would I don't feel I don't feel like it's necessary but if it was up to me I would certainly want them to make more than one more I feel like that world is right for the picking man like I think that that world is way more interesting than any world of Uncharted even um I I I",

What does it look like? Yeah, I think that... I think people are looking at it too narrowly in terms of like well The Last of Us was great and leave it alone. And I don't necessarily disagree with that sentiment because it's very similar to True Detective - the first season True Detective was phenomenal, and I only watched the first episode of the second season, True Detective, and I hated it, and I never watched any of it, and lo and behold everyone hates it, and it's like sometimes you need to leave... you know, let it have its legacy, just leave it alone.
