You know if you want to have sex with other people that's great, like have sex with people that are interested in having sex, you know not somebody that is looking to get back in a relationship with you yeah cuz basically what's happening is this she's thinking that if she gives you what you want you will eventually reciprocate and you are lying to her right now you're being dishonest and that's the unfortunate truth and you know it that's why you're asking that question so you got to just break it off clean man because the other problem is this you are headed toward it and at a certain point you're going to have to have that conversation and it's going to be even harder no pun intended uh down the road and it's hard too because CU it's like when something's so easy like that it's it's hard to say no to you know what I mean when it's just like when you've been there before it's something",
