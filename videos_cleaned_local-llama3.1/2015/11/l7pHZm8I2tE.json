We're 100 episodes into the show, and at least 25 of those episodes mention at least one of these things that you recall. The Bugs never heard that. I've never heard that either. I've never heard that either. It's me. Not only have we done 100 episodes of this show, Greg and I did like 300 episodes of Podcast Beyond, and I've lived together with him for five years. So uh, I feel like I should know that. Yeah, but I don't. I'm writing this down. I have to. I understand what we're saying. I think it's the longing for what was. But I don't. I don't think of it in a negative way or like... yeah, like when I say like I I have no regrets or whatever. I mean what we're talking it's the same conversation we're having now where it's like every choice has gotten me here. That's what I used to I always tell my friends right when they'll talk to me",

Oh okay, I was going to say well I want to know because I I do remember the root of nostalgia, the Latin root of it being something negative. I feel like I might have heard it at the same time as you guys talked about it on a show. Because something else I wanted to bring up is that it's ridiculously uncanny, the timing and the topics you guys talk about how they would happen in my life. It's funny that a lot of people say that stuff and that's cool. I mean, I think that just shows that we're having conversations that everyone else has so it's like when we're having them someone else is having it too.
