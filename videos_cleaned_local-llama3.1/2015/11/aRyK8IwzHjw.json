Yeah, it has gotten out of hand. I feel like there was a tipping point where when we were kids, probably just because we were kids and we didn't know any better, you'd see it on the news or whatever, you'd hear about Black Friday, or somebody's going to go out and get this deal or whatever - they'd grab their flyer and circle the things they wanted, and it was all well and good.
