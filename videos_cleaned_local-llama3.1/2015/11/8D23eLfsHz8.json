Um, I think The Sniper Wolf in Metal Gear Solid is what I was talking about when it goes back to me, and you know I talk about Metal Gear being a turning point in my life in terms of what I thought video games could be or where they were going, kind of thing. And yeah, I always go back to that - you know, it's me and Po in my basement playing that on a summer night, right? And it's like two teenagers sitting there, and we're just like totally in raptures as she's saying goodbye, and O comes up crying, and like we're both trying not to get choked up while we watch this.

The same thing even with Fallout - again, no spoilers - but like there's this one quest I went on and I don't know if everybody gets it or what, but like you know it's going to be this thing, it's a death-defying mission, and you suit up and you're going and",

It's like it wasn't, but that was the same thing with Ocarina of Time. People always talk about Hyrule Field, yeah, but for me, like the moment in The Wind Waker - that crazy moment - is when you jump forward in time for the first time and you're young Link or whatever, and you open those doors, and they had done such a great **** job of setting up what like the town square looked like and how lively and bright and vibrant and fun and light... I mean, light in terms of brightness and then light in terms of character and like emotion. Right? And you open it up, and it's **** mummies.",

That they totally... when somebody's setting something up in a game and you don't even know it till you get there and then like there's the flip, you're like \"oh, that's why this was like that.\" Yeah, man. Uh, but the moment that I didn't expect from the game was in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, the boss fight... um, I don't remember who what the big guy is, he's got his hands out like this, but it was like when you get the hook, the dual hook shots and you're like Spider-Man swinging around and you're fighting this giant bird thing and like it's going around, there are four towers, you have to hook shot.",

And I just have these overwhelming emotions with these moments that I'll never forget. Smash Bros has a million of them, sure. Yeah, well, I mean, that's all I always talk about. I've written about it; it's arguably my most famous non-review from my blog. Right? It's how Infamous affected me when I was going through my divorce or whatever right...

Um, these little girls are like running around, going in and out of these tubes, like... and it's like \"what the heck is going on here\"? Bioshock - that's why I was so disappointed in Infinite because I was like \"it did kind of lose the feeling of that\". I mean, it's hard to replicate that. But um, so there's that. And I think Dead Space is another one of those games that gave me this really... this this feeling of mystery. For Boing, I think that game is supremely special. I think that might be a claustrophobic thing too, yeah. And I think that might be the best survival horror game of all time, when you really",
