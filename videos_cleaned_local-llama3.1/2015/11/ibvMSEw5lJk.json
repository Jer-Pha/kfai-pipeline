The reason I brought up PlayStation PS I Love You is I do it all the time; it's hard. We're still learning exactly five or six episodes in now. You're allowed to do that. Um, the reason I bring that up is the first topic of the day is the PlayStation conference at Paris Games Week. Paris Games Week, sure, sure.

It is weird and I think it's pretty obvious it's because of the movie. You know? Other than that, the game would have... I'm pretty sure would be done this year.

Yeah, I think actually, I think you glossed over what was most significant about the announcement, which was other than the release date - that the six DLC characters will be free if you use in-game currency. So I thought that, I thought that was a really interesting move because they're basically saying, as Greg and I talked about on PS I Love You, that they'll certainly be available to buy, but you have to imagine you can use this in-game currency that you can earn - like anyone can earn currency - and you can spend it on the characters and get them for free, which I think is cool.

I was really excited to see Dhalsim especially because he's old and huge, he has a beard and stuff. I think it's like really cool evolution as opposed to what they did to Ken where they kind of messed up Ken. Um, I love how you say that just based on his hair yeah well and just I mean everything's different is you know you can give him different outfits and he's just doesn't look a Ken at all you know like that's not like doesn't white he's a blonde white guy and a red kimono suit.

Um, so I am interested to see what the final character is - I assume I assume it's got to be an existing character, like Guile or something. I, I you know because there's just too many, I feel like in my opinion as just a again a passive Street Fighter fan; I know people like are friend Vince that IGN would be excited about testing new characters and figuring them out - I do feel like there's it seems to be quite a few weird characters from the past or new characters and not enough OG homies.

Um, what I would say is that I don't want to play games to make the game that I'm going to play. Media Molecule's very creative and they're very artistic. Make a game and give it to me to play it. That's what they did with Tearaway. There was no creation in Tearaway. I understand that, that's their heritage. With LittleBigPlanet, you went through, you created the face. That's not what I'm talking about, though. Greg, that that has a linear, like, campaign right? But they still put the onus on you to do things. This, I mean, this is rehashing PS I love you, but I still think it's just like you're coming at it from one perspective and they're coming from the exact opposite of...

Then the most baffling piece of marketing is the commercial two-pack showing two separate perspectives of the same scene - you may remember Master Chief looking down on a dying Lock King contrasting with an alternate scene that reverses the roles and shows a Lock King chastising a wounded John-117. Both scenes end with the implied execution in a ravaged city, whose last standing structure is a monument to Master Chief above the Infinity's smoldering remains in the sky, possibly singed towards the planet's surface.

Um, and gameplay is absolutely king, so um, that's why, and and I've beaten the horse dead, and why I'm so excited about Matterfall and Alienation from Housemarque, because they make perfect gameplay games like that. They're they do twin-stick shooters, and and they are games you play and master and get better at.

This is the answer, and instead they said, \"Here's a controller.\" Everyone make a Steam Box.

Nobody cares if it is going to happen now or in the near future; no, it's going to happen at some point. It's far from over; I conclude it's going to happen in my opinion. So I disagree with Greg, and certainly saying like \"no\" at all - I think it's inevitable; it's totally... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit you; I'm mad at you, but I didn't mean to hit you. It's okay. I think it's inevitable that they do it, and it's not just whoever it is - I agree that Steam and Valve really blew it with the Steam Box.

Um, because to the point, like there is a wealth of games spanning since the late 70s really that can be played on the same sort of I don't want to say architecture because that's not necessarily true but you can play like the game we play a game like Oregon Trail is the way we play a game like Dota 2 right. It's it's a it's a m it's a computer and a monitor and a mouse or a keyboard or something like that.
