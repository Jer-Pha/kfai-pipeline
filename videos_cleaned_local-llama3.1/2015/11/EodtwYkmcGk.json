How about I didn't see Data in that trailer? God damn it, you're so much better. But that trailer got me. The trailer was great.

I'm not good at that stuff. Like, I'm just not good, so that makes it not fun. Yeah, I hear you. Like last night, right now we've talked about this in person in our personal time; Kai, not you, uh... The fact that we're in a holding pattern for Fallout 4 and the fact that nothing is Fallout 4 makes you want to play nothing. You know what I mean? That's where I'm at right now.

Um, but I mean at least on the PS2 era like they were all great. I loved the first one, um, then the second and third they were great, but I was just like, \"All right, this is just...I needed a break,\" I think. And then so when they came back, I liked them, but then once it got like Deadlocked and stuff, I was like, \"It's a little overkill.\" Got um, I'm excited for this to come back, and the fact that it is kind of like a reboot, reimagining whatever, and it's like a movie tie-in, but not really...like it's whatever people have been saying these games look like Pixar movies.

I hear you. My problem with it is I feel like I've been talking about it forever; in this **** movie, yeah. They they announced the movie forever ago talked about the game forever ago and we're still not like the game's not out this year. Yeah, it is; it is weird. And I think it it's it's pretty obvious it's because of the movie you know otherwise the game would have I'm pretty sure would be done this year.

Um, so yeah, I think that it's time to go back. I think the game's probably going to be great; I mean, the the core Ratchet games are all great. Um, and I think that's why people really love the PS2 Trilogy, and they like cracking time, but I think those are the games for a lot of people. That's why I'm excited.

I was really excited to see Dhalsim, especially because he's old and has a beard and stuff. I think it's like really cool evolution as opposed to what they did to Ken where they kind of messed up Ken. Um, I love how you say that just based on his hair, yeah well no, and just I mean everything's different is you know you can give him different outfits and he's just doesn't look a Ken at all you know like that's not blond he's a blonde white guy and has a red kimono.

Um, so I am to see what the final character is; I assume I assume it's got to be an existing character like Guile or something. I, I you know because there's just too many, I feel like in my opinion as just a again a passive Street Fighter fan, I know people like our friend Vince at IGN would be excited about testing new characters and figuring them out. I do feel like there's it seems to be quite a few weird characters from the past or new characters and not enough OG homies; I mean but that was Street Fighter 4 though you know, and I think they're trying to do something at least a little bit",

I love that when I was a kid, and now having it be interactive and a game being made out of it reminds me of Disneyland with the Buzz Lightyear game where you have the laser guns you can shoot everyone knows well, arcade games, carnival games as I call them, but not carnival games - the PlayStation Move game.

The other game is an on-rail shooter that uses VR, and I'm like, \"Okay, so what is Until Dawn now? Like, why does this have to be Until Dawn based?\" And I think it is a marketing thing, but I think this is like easy gains now that can injure you later. I'm not going to say it's going to...
