It would look like someone who has 30 minutes to 45 minutes one night, just being like, \"I want to get in there, I want to blast somebody, I want to get in an AT-ST for a hot minute and blast people and get blown up, and then be done.\" Like, I think this is like... but I'm immersed in this rich world of Star Wars, and I think that's a value add that we shouldn't discount in terms of people's ongoing satisfaction and enjoyment with the game. Like, people are gonna be hyped about Star Wars well through December, well into the new year, and even though it's you know, the new new trilogy still, they're going to be coming back to that old like Star Wars feel to have their lightsaber moment, you know, have that stuff.

For me, when I regen the first time in like it was such a turn off to me, you know, that's prestiging or whatever, and you start back at zero, and then it's like all right, to get to the next level, do this, you have to get like 50 shotgun kills.

Right now, I am set on getting to level 15, getting my jetpack, but more importantly being able to buy the head with the girl who has the ponytail.

Oh yeah, yeah, I had a fun battle between Luke Skywalker and Boba Fett.

But I don't know, I don't know if that's gonna be fun five times; yeah, yeah, it was fun once; yeah, no, that's a good point.
