It's true they don't have to, and in fact, they have more to lose by doing it than gain because the fact remains that Half-Life is a really beloved franchise, but it is not Grand Theft Auto or something like where there's not a financial imperative for them to do this. They might hurt themselves not financially, cuz they have so much money from Steam, but they might hurt the creator that you like if Half-Life 3 isn't good or not as good as people expect it then they won't be life-changing fantastic yet and that's the problem. It's Duke Nukem Forever, it's The Last Guardian, it's been cooking for so long and it's more its nose I think sure but I'm getting to give you a touchstone of like it's been going for so long expectation and hype is to such a fever pitch without anything mm-hmm you can't yeah you can't do it.",

I don't know, it's the same as what I said about The Last Guardian. What would have you known in what state of readiness it was on PS3 when Clemens played it a long time ago when he went to see an E3 demo in Tokyo? So this was in 2010 maybe 2011, I don't know, like what state it was in at that point. But what Sony has gained more financially and critically if they just released a 6.0 then release this game now. That cannot matter how good it is will never live up to the hype that The Last Guardian has behind it. I think that's one of the problems, they must see.\"",

Yeah, I mean, I feel like pretty much it's at that point, at least, getting new people on or whatever. It's just don't do it or do it cool. Borden says how much do you guys think streaming support or the lack of could tip the scales of VR really catching on? Streaming games, the stream movies. I think I think what he's talking about is being there's no way to stream VR like with Twitch and YouTube.

Oh, yeah, it's a game where like it'll ask you a question then you have to make a fake answer to the question then the people have to pick which answer they should buy that. It's a great game. That sounds good. I last played it on Xbox One with our friend Nate however it's becoming increasingly difficult to find games that are that offer local multiplayer outside of that we, you and the exclusive split-screen and Halo Guardians increases my concerns what are your thoughts on this and you feel like local multiplayer is on its way out completely?

So I think I feel like since I've been in the industry, it's been on its way out. That's all you ever hear: as the machines get more and more powerful, the harder and harder it is to render the game twice to make it look as good and deliver the experience you want. Well, and in addition to that, with online going from this like kind of niche thing that's just kind of a gimmick to being the way people play games, split-screen is on its way out. I remember when the first time that I was upset by a game not having split-screen was Counter-Strike on the Xbox; yeah, it came and I was just like, \"Well, I'm ****\" I love playing Halo split-screen but I'm not gonna **** play this **** online; I just wanna",

Yeah, yeah. There you don't play Uncharted to play online. Mm-hmm. Greg Miller says hello, lads. I was wondering what location and time period you'd like to see used in an open-world game.

You know, that's a mate I always wanted - a real-time or not a real-time, turn-based almost cartoonish economic and strategy game based in the Revolution, so like a fancy Tactics-style game and American Revolution. I think would be awesome. But I mean, that's it. Even had like ideas and little designs drawn up about it being a 3D or an 8-bit game, but that would be like... I just like that time period.

I never considered myself addicted to games, I've been definitely obsessed with them, period. With them, so my concern, i mean, the last game I obsessively played was well that came out with Mega Man 10, that was like the last game where I could just shut everyone up and go play it without anyone saying anything, I don't care about you, I'm gonna play this game now. And that was really the last time I ever had a breakdown moment in my life where I'm like this has to be this way. I would give so much to be able to just go back and see your reaction when Mega Man 9 was announced, yeah, I ran around the IGN office, I couldn't believe it. But my concern now is that I'm I'm up, is that like do I play games enough you know to",

It's it's all about balance, you know. It's okay to be a little addicted or obsessed with a game or games ever; you just have to find that balance. But that's different for every different person. I was there was a really fascinating NeoGAF thread to read, I read some time ago like a couple months ago where people like how often you play video games so the question was like how many hours a week do you play games and I read like the whole thing it was fascinating cuz it was like it's spanned literally anywhere from like I don't play video games 'cause I have a kid and **** why my life and or have a job or I just don't care anymore, you know.",
