I'm like I don't read the graphic novel before it comes out, and I watched the movie, and I was like this is a really cool interpretation, like almost a frame by frame interpretation of what I read minus of course a couple things that you kind of should I thought should be changed uh Nam the ending was a little bit weird and it kind of made more sense I think in the in the movie and they cut out some of the the newspaper stuff which I which I thought honestly I mean for",

I think it was before me. Okay, yeah. Like, I did a weird run on that thing. Watchmen also holds a special place in my heart because I think because of that, I was like, \"Oh, there's also these awesome graphic novels from back in the day that I should read.\" And I went back and read one called The Dark Knight Returns, and I'm like, \"That was worth it.\" Published in '86 and '87, collected in '87.

He says one of the most telling characters is Rorschach in the comic; he's repulsive and ludicrous, a tiny man who wears lifts in his shoes. He suffers from major sexual problems, and his disguise is a street person whose placard reads \"The End Is Near.\" In the backstory, this makes him both more likable and less admirable. The moment in the comic when he threatens his landlady is uncomfortable, but the next panel where he spares her because of her child, who reminds him of himself as a boy, is extremely poignant. Snyder alludes to some of this; we see Rorschach and his civvies wandering around with his sign, but it never coheres. Viewers new to the story might not even realize that this nutty doomsayer is the vigilante's alter ego.

You can't just, you know, glaze over like you guys are talking about Superman, how it explains to you exactly what's happening. Watchmen doesn't do that. All I see is, \"I don't know why Jeff Goldblum is Jean Hackman, that'd be amazing.\" Uh, but Watchmen doesn't hold your hand in that way entirely. I mean, it's a movie, so you know there has to have a plot that makes sense.
