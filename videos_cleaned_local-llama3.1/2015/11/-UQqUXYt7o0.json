I didn't think you guys were going to make fun of it a little bit more. We went down that rabbit hole hard. Uh, this comes from our good friend TTR (or) over on Patreon of Funny. You go there and sponsor a topic. Yeah, you can if you say forward one more time. I say it now. I'm HTTP maybe S H H HTTP S. This is a long one. I'll pray for no. I'll read the whole thing. The entire plot was in the trailer. I get irritated, upset, and let down when a film comes out, and the pertinent plot points are beat-bopping and scatting all over the place. The most recent case I could think of was Jurassic World. They kept releasing long trailers full of giveaways. Does this bother you? Does this bother you guys when you watch a trailer? Yes, and the entire **** movie is in the trailer. It's the worst, and it's so prevalent these days. Old the older trailers didn't do this. When when",

I don't know. Um, I think say the internet right? Like before trailers were just before movies, and then you'd see a TV spot, yeah. But like now it's the trailer people don't think of as before movies; they think of it as when does it drop online, and that's why they are event things where there's multiple trailers for a movie was before it was standard to have you know the trailer and then like the launch trailer and then TV spots usually three 30-second ones. Now it's like a ton. Yeah, no, I think it bothers me too. I mean with Jurassic Park, and I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to get into spoiler territory, but I'm pretty sure they show the most important frame in that entire movie where at the very, very end, like third-act climax where",

But I can't imagine like it's impossible to do that nowadays because not only do you have to dodge the trailers, you need to dodge all the talk about it with Twitter and with IGN and with us and with all these things. Like there's no way that you don't know at least x amount of Star Wars just because people talking about it, you know? Or like every headline or every freaking thumbnail or screen cap or whatever of the trailers like that, that alone gives stuff away. So it's like I like to buy into the hype because once the movie's out, the movie's out. It's like that is a finite experience but the hype and you can put a level of like how good was it? But when it comes to the trailers and all the hype and stuff, that's just as good as you want it to be so I like to just spoil the **** out of myself for most movies.",

I can choose to watch all the trailers, like there's a TV spot where someone uh that I think it was running last week where there was some other stuff that someone told me about, I was like I don't want to watch that, I want to see that scene in the movie for the first time. um and yeah, I feel like those trailers have done a good job of not like there's enough in there where I question",

You know what I mean?\" Yeah, but I feel like with Star Wars also, like they don't have the burden of having to tell you what this brand new franchise is. You kind of get it; you know it's Star Wars. They could have just showed Star Wars and then just the **** just the Millennium Falcon just cruising for like 5 seconds, and I'm like, \"I'm going to wait.\" It's having trouble starting it for a second; it's just kind of there, just... it's like slowly F, and then it just goes up and says Star Wars.

Yeah, I mean, that would have been true, but like you have a movie like Ant-Man where you're like, okay, well they need to go the other way with it; they need to show so much of this because no one's going to see a movie called Ant-Man and uh, it worked; people went and saw it; people liked it; it was good. Um, but I'm not going to lie, like there was nothing in Ant-Man that I watched that really wowed me 'cause I had seen 90% of it in the trailers. And even any of like...like that one great shot where you know uh they're fighting miniature and like it's all this crazy explosions then it like stops for a second and it goes like normal person, and the train hits and falls down. Just in the movie, you're like I'm waiting for it; I'm waiting for it; wait there it is. That's what that would have been an amazing moment in the film.

So it's like I remember seeing them being like oh **** that's cool, but every other Marvel movie, it's like the trailers are as good as a perfect example is Avengers: Age of Ultron right, they showed like the last scene where they're defending the McGuffin, I can't even remember the center and all of them are like flying around it and like you know shit's happening, you're like this that's I bet that's a really cool moment at the climax of this movie, the most important part emotionally.",

I think it's one of the reasons with Amazon things I'm taking more chances on movies I've never heard of, but like I I know this actor and I know that actress and they're in this thing and I've never seen this indie or whatever, and it's like okay, whatever, I'm not going to watch the trailer because it's like that's the worst is watching the trailer right before you watch the movie. Well, no, I'm not going to do this; it's going to tell me everything.
