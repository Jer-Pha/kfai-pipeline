            "text": "to be eventually like I always say when you're in your 20s you should be working very very hard toward being the person you want to be in your 30s and the most important part about that is the fact that you need to not try to be someone that's attractive to women, try to be someone that you want to be and that will be attractive to people. A big problem that I think a lot of people fall into around like guys around the high school through Early College levels of their lives is like the guys that aren't getting the girlfriends left and right, you know we're not talking about the cool kids and you know all boys, the quarterback and the baseball players football players basketball players the waterball players the volleyball players. The thing with that though is there's these people that aren't getting that and they're like they are the normal ones, you know like that's I think the most",

Here's what's going to happen: you're going to go do something you're passionate about - maybe film, writing, math, or whatever - and invest yourself in it. You'll get lost in it, immerse yourself, and start having success. I guarantee that's when you'll meet someone in the same field or with common interests, and you'll click. It's always counterintuitive: when you want a girlfriend, you can't get one; but the second you don't want one is when you find the girl you might be with for life - that is entirely correct to take it",
