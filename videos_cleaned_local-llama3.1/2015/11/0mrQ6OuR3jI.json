And we're talking about 50 some odd years of the franchise. So what I had the realization on this one was although it's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination; it's well made, the action's cool, very okay. It's just that every single thing in it feels oddly reminiscent of every movie that came before it, and that's starting to wear on me a little bit again. I... I have a love for this franchise that Bond lines on Blind Faith, and so I don't... I'm not going to leave it just yet. You know what I mean?

Oh, really? Well, yeah, that's one of the tropes that people make fun of a lot in the series: everyone knows who he is most of the time, like he just goes around telling people his name is Bond, James Bond. Like, oh, I guess I'll just do a quick Google search for you right now - A Different World agent, yeah, money, pennies in there, taking it all out; she did, yeah, yeah. It's interesting; it's one of those franchises that obviously has been around for so long and seen so many different decades of filmmaking and different decades of just decades - uh, it's seen decades of decades, I mean, but it's interesting to me that the franchise has seen a lot of restarts and a lot of different styles in it, where you know depending on",

And also, those bad guys there was something above them; they were all together, and that's where it started to lose it because they tried to, with Skyfall, they tried to sort of have a lot of homages to the Original Series right, and they had like very very straight - before they weren't even subtle. It was like the original car comes back, and with the ejector seat, and all that stuff, and you see sort of updated versions of that here.

I don't think he'd been well known at all; I don't think he'd done anything before that, and I don't think he's done anything since, which is unfortunate because that movie actually wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. But I think that's Dan Craig's fear now is that he wants out of the series because he's been typecast, but I don't know if that's true; I don't think I buy that.
