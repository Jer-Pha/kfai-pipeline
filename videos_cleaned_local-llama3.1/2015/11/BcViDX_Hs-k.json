I put his name in the title of the panel; you'd hope they were like, \"Oh, we better book him up for that.\" But who knows? If not, I'll just bring David Jaffe and whip his ass at TowerFall Ascension - that's the plan. Otherwise, Colin has some things he wants to do. Lots are happening so five o'clock PSX Saturday, we're gonna be doing it. Non-I, we'll be promoting this down your throats the rest of November well into December.

Number 10 Ubisoft released sales data indicating that PlayStation 4 is its strongest platform for game releases, more than doubling the sales of PS4's competitor Xbox One, according to GameSpot, which relayed the data. PS4 accounted for 27% of Ubisoft's game sales in the six months ending November or I'm sorry, September 30th, which is down from 32% the year before. Meanwhile, Xbox One accounted for 12% of sales, down from 15%. PlayStation 3 stood at 9%, down from 19% as the console slowly wanes. Now, as we talked about on Colin and Greg, and I think this is interesting and salient, we have to talk about how Sony talks about PS4 sales a lot - 29.3 million as of the end of September, I think so they're up to probably over 30 now.

I it I love it, take me to school cons, it's easy, right? It's easy, it's easy. If PS4 accounts for 27% of Ubisoft's game sales and Xbox One accounts for 12% of the Ubisoft game sales, then Xbox One presumably has sold less than half of the amount of PS4 sold. If everything's equal, I think that this data is an interesting window into a possibility in which Xbox one has sold 14 million units. Okay, unless game buying behavior is different on those two consoles and I don't know that. But I think it's safe to assume that PS4 is beating Xbox One about two to one based on this data.

Why there's an easy way to look and see if we change the set, Moo Jatu, and it's all spelled out like \"Boo\" right into Kinda Funny.com/PSQ.

PS I Love You XOXO - I mean, it's obvious why they're not. But I mean nobody bought it; it didn't buy; nobody's bought the V. Like do you want? I understand what you're saying: we there's few folks in the world who love their Vita more than Colin and I. Like what are we really going to knock them for this?

It's not like if you put Gravity Rush 2 wasn't going to be the game that was going to save the PlayStation. That was not going to be the one that comes out and sells a gazillion units. That was Minecraft, and a month before it was supposed to come out, it got torpedoed and became a Microsoft game. Yeah, I agree. I mean, I would love...
