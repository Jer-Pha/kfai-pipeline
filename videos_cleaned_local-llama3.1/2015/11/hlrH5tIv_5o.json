Um, Sony was all about hiding their numbers when they were losing, so it's not exactly an uncommon thing. I mean, Sony hasn't talked about Vita sales numbers for instance in a long time; they combined PSP and Vita every time to like make the numbers seem bigger than they really were, so that's not uncommon. So I think a lot of it has to do with or I think some of it has to do anyway with Xbox One not being a compelling device for a lot of people based just on the roll out.

But my assumption is PS2 really took off and that line is going to start going vertical soon and so PS4 will probably fall behind that as well eventually but not anytime soon. And there's no shame in falling behind Wii or PS2 because it's those were such a great part of the zeitgeist.

They're there telling you every time and they say it, and I respect that. Yeah, and it's so frustrating to me that these big companies just hide their numbers. I want to know how Xbox One's selling, you know? Yeah, and they can just spin it so easily, like, \"Yeah, maybe PS4 is beating us, but look at how well we're doing compared to the Xbox 360.\" And also by the way, we're splitting our games focus to PC now, and all these kinds of things. You know, making different plays. It's just...

One of the most common things I hear about from your podcast is PlayStation Network IDs needing to be able to change them. I'd like to propose that you and your audience ask for something different - PSN ID aliases, these can be stored independently of the PSN IDs and then be used to reference the original user ID for whatever Insanity Sony has going on in the background in their database.

What if Naughty Dog plans to do a Metal Gear Solid 2 on us? Where we only play as Nathan Drake for the first chapter and then play the rest of the game as his brother.

He's not a stupid man; no, and he's actually probably the smartest man in any room he's in.

Grand Theft Auto 5 was special because we didn't see anything from Grand Theft Auto from 2009 to 2013, that's why it was special.

I don't suspect that we'll hear anything from Elder Scrolls until well after Fallout 4's DLC is done because you have to assume that it's the same studio now. Do they have a small team working on Elder Scrolls 6 probably or something else probably? Yeah, they're big and they're profitable but that's got to be an all hands on deck kind of thing. And when you're making an open world RPG like that, I mean that's got to be pretty daunting. I assume what they're working on right now is the DLC and I assume that they're going to support the game for DLC for a year so I don't think you're gonna hear anything about it soon.
