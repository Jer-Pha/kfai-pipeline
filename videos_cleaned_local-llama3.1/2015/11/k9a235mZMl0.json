Okay, let's do it then. So Nick, yep, today's question comes from 27-year-old Kevin. Okay, not our Kevin, our Kevin's younger than that, it's true. Kevin says, \"Hey Tim and Nick, my girlfriend recently brought up wanting to film us having sex. You guys seem to know how to do things. What do I do?\" There's a song that this reminds me of, MH Tim. It's by Mr. Loggins okay, it's called \"Highway to the Danger Zone\" okay and that's where you're at right now Kevin. Uh let's take a step back before we get into the nitty gritty okay. This is a dangerous territory you're in because somehow some way this is going to wind up in the wrong hands I just want you to know that I have no doubt of this whatsoever, I doubt that, that's not necessarily true. Let's start roll this back here's what happens here's what happens you're going to do this you're going to film",

Let's start rolling back here's what happens here's what happens you're going to do this you're going to film this and then you're free to share it with a friend like me who's going to go \"dude let me just see it\" let me just see it bro, and they're going to figure it out or you're going to have a friend like Kevin even worse and he's going to actually rip it off your phone and put it on Pornhub. Okay right now you do this it's winding up on YouTube, see this is for the people that don't understand how this all works and think that everything's going to get hacked or whatever if you know what you're doing, mhm, that **** that **** is encrypted, that **** is protected, it's all good, you're totally safe, totally good. All right my question for you Nick yes have you ever filmed yourself having sex no I have not been able to actually talk anyone into that have you tried uh no I haven't because I",

I think you should start simple and just look for nice Vine clips, six seconds here, six seconds there, maybe an Instagram clip that's 15 seconds long. You know, you just want to know the specific things you're looking for, just dip your toe in. Mhm. And the thing with faces is it's like avoiding faces is usually a good thing, I think it's a good thing overall, just because it minimizes risk, but then again there's no fun in that. For the love of God, don't film like this; turn the camera horizontally so that when I eventually come across it late at night, I can actually enjoy it. Kevin, come closer, come closer, come closer. At some point, she might be on top of you - good for you, good for her, it's a great position for her. Okay, keep the footage steady; does that make sense? That makes too much sense.
