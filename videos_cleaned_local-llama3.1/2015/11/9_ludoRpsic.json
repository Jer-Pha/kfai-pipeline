I should have just said that from the beginning, but uh, the first question comes from our boy Alex Cross who we yesterday did a Google Hangout with - right, excellent. Supported us over at Patreon.com and uh, he had a question for us that I'm like \"ah, I like that a lot.\" What would get you to pre-order a game? You know, we live in this world where back in the day pre-orders felt a little bit more natural as part of there limited supply. Yeah, so I wanted to make sure I got F-Zero GX on the GameCube, you know, I wanted to make sure Devil May Cry too - so upset about that but I wanted it right.

I did now though never, I mean well that's the thing yeah never like do you guys yeah really no, I mean but I mean what I don't think pre-order means what it used to mean, pre-order to me used to mean oh man I want Perfect Dark on day one so I'm going to go do it and hey got a fanny pack out of the deal that was whatever cool I got that you'd go there because I I I had those those those days where I'd show up at uh EB and I'd Electronics Boutique still I'd go into EB and try to get the game and they be like oh we only got two and we're out and then you go to Target and they didn't have it and you know you'd be screwed right so that's why I started pre-ordering now I digitally pre-order everything if I if I'm going to",

I'm not pre-ordering every game I'm interested in right, like there's enough games that come out, and I'm like, \"Well, I'd see how that one turns out before I throw money at it.\" But when it's Rocksteady, when it's Bethesda, when it's whoever, I know that I want it, and I'm at a fever pitch of excitement, and I want to play it right away. Yeah, for me, a long time ago, it was like more of a Pit Boy type situation where it's like, \"Where there's something that I want that I couldn't get otherwise.\" So with The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, if you pre-ordered, you got that the Ocarina of Time and...

The last games I remember like really going in pre-ordering were like uh Resident Evil Zero and like the Resident Evil re-releases on GameCube, I don't know why I remember that so well and that was in 2003, I think, so I I didn't I didn't do much pre-ordering after that. Uh people have to remember that back especially in the cartridge era uh there really were a finite amount of games it wasn't clear that games would be republished ever um because of the allocation of chips were where expensive and the allocation of cartridges were it was hard, the example I use is Rings of Power, which was Naughty Dog's Genesis game, it was an RPG, and that game had",

If you're emulating or you're pirating something, you're stealing it, and it doesn't matter if it's old or new - you're stealing it, and what you're doing is wrong and illegal in the main right. I mean, and that's just where we have to start with the conversation so I start from that place because I think that if a game is currently available and easy to find and reasonable to find then it's probably wrong to pirate it - so even might go back to your PS2 or your PS1, I mean depending on the game you're talking about.

Until then, I'm not playing this game where my computer might get **** up or whatever. So, in other words, the impetus is on them to fix the problem. Some might argue that in this regard, the impetus is on the license holders to proliferate these games if they don't want things to be pirated. But it's not always that easy. So, yeah, um, so it's a very muddled gray area, and that's all it is \u2013 it's not good or bad; it's just muddled and **** up. And your opinion on it and your approach to it will be different.

Games were always like when I was into a game, and I always tell the story of WrestleMania 2000 right? Like when I was waiting for WrestleMania 2000, I knew someone in the area would break street date, and that's why I'd come home from school and call on a list of stores asking about it. And inevitably, I'd get like, \"WrestleMania 2000\" was at the Walmart; I was like, \"Yeah, do you have WrestleMania 2000?\" Like, \"Yeah,\" and I was like, \"What? Thank you. What wait?
