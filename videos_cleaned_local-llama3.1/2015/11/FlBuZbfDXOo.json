You're about to listen to before we jump into the show and the shenanigans and the PlayStation stuff. We wanted to take a moment to talk about Alex Oldhouser, uh, if you haven't been following us on Twitter, missed our Twitch stuff, and it's kind of weird because chronologically you're listening, you might be listening to a Game Over Greggy show over on Kinda Funny or The Games Cast that was recorded before any of this happened.

So, PS2 Classics are natively emulated on PS3, for instance, but this is indicating that the emulation is running on PS4 in a different sort of way, which is what I mean by saying it's in Star comparison to the way PS2 Classics ran in a vacuum, where it was just like you boot it up and now you're playing a PS2. The three out of the four Star Wars games that came out - you know, retro Star Wars games, it's sad to call them retro because they're PS2 games - um, but they have trophies, and so if they are indeed running as emulated PS2 Classics with some sort of software on PS4, that is a huge step forward.

I believe that FromSoftware has to create new things; there will be new types of games coming from us, and Dark Souls 3 is an important marker in the evolution of FromSoftware.\" This is probably startling news to a lot of people, um, but I don't believe that Bloodborne specifically is done.

I was playing it easy too. I love the premise of Catherine; I love the premise of it. It's so unlike anything you've ever seen. It's about a guy who...and there's more to it than this, but a guy who is cheating on his girlfriend basically, and how he has nightmares about it.
