I was like, \"I didn't know anything about the Covenant.\" Like it just got me invested in this world so much. So Halo one almost for like nostalgic reasons. I mean, Hal yeah. Halo 1 is so special to me for the same reasons both campaign and multiplayer. Like I think my first dual stick shooter was TimeSplitters on PS2, and I loved that for the quirky story and for whatever but it felt like GoldenEye just like where same guys right? Yeah, exactly. And it felt that way, and it was like you... The aiming is kind of it wasn't it felt clunky yeah. I always thought that was a weird thing that they carried over to TimeSplitters that um GoldenEye did where because it wasn't a twin-stick shooter, GoldenEye being what it was, you'd have to stop, hold aim, and then... I was like, \"Okay, that was a limitation.\" And then uh TimeSS a TN and they still had that mechanic.",

I just did a I did just replayed it with Lawrence, we did a co-op mission for it uh with Master Chief Collection when it works it's great uh but Co-op kept kicking us out and it sucked but when we did that level we landed I was just like hard on this is so good like it even because they did the remaster thing with it so it still feels good like I get that nostalgic ping of like can't believe the game's 10 12 years old now yeah we're old we are we're very old yeah um I don't know I kind of need help with a fifth what's a good like classic game that everyone renown as like Mario any Mario on that list Mario because that kind of rounds out your list that's lazy I don't um oh you know what um it's GNA be a Zelda oh it's got be",

A Link to the Past was my I'm an A Link to the Past guy, I I never played the first one on NES it just looked way too hard for me I mean it was for a little kid at least yeah I was I mean I must have been five or six or whatever when it came out the game released in '85 or '86 yeah I was",

Yeah, I've played it since yes, yes they're almost remakes of each other exactly kind. And that's the thing is like that, and I wonder how much that is cuz every Zelda since Majora's Mask right I'm always like can we stop telling the same **** story over and over again it is you know it's there's dungeons there then eventually you need to collect three things then there's an alternate version of the same place you're in where you need to get five or seven more things but think of it from this perspective just because it's your 18th Zelda you played it's someone else's first yeah I know for sure and like I I'm totally with that but it just it does suck like my biggest",

I love the art style how it was like pseudo cyberpunk um future fantasy kind of - this weird like I guess once you got out of Midgar, it was mostly fantasy but like I love the world that they built and I love that were like this there's this weird clash it was so unique. Children came out like \"oh looks like every other anime\" it looks like every other anime, it's super dark and all of a sudden Cloud's like they just ruined Cloud's character he went from being this guy that like had issues but was still kind of fun and like did the whole crossdressing thing and all of that and then you get Sephiroth and he's just a Hot Topic.
