I thought I'd get a little bit more of a wow factor, and I didn't. Yeah, um. But there's a Wolf Link amiibo, so Zigger's happy out there, of course. Zigger must be in a coma right now with all the amiibo talk and all these different amiibos. I'll say that I think it's a smart move for them to release the game because a lot of people do love it, and there isn't you know, there's a dearth of games on Wii U. So I mean, I think it makes perfect sense even if the new Zelda was going to come out in the summer or something like that. I don't think it affects it at all.

I Think It's upsetting I wished that in the time we hadn't heard about the game they just completely moved over and started fresh on the NX. It's still possible that they're doing that again, remember like we said it before they're in the space in between right now and so they can't necessarily you know Twilight Princess was a GameCube in a Wii game and I I don't I don't necessarily think that it's not it's impossible that this is the same thing they just can't say that yeah yeah no and I I think I will be shocked if this game's not on NX in some form.

So it's as long as you treat them well towards the end of the life cycle like Nintendo's fan base is demonstrably shrinking and you need to take care of those people before you try to expand out with a Blue Ocean strategy - kind of thing only works when you have a strong foundation, which is why the Wii I think succeeded. Because I just don't feel like burning me hard, let's move on. I want good things.

Then Star Fox, we saw a trailer April 22nd is the new release date, we saw more of the Walker, the Landmaster now has a Grav Master mode that like the tank kind of hovers and stuff, they went through the controls and stuff, that's just the normal thing it's always been right.

But again, there is a significant Nintendo legacy, like the original Street Fighter II was a Nintendo game and so it's you know that's an NES game and then Street Fighter II was at home on Super Nintendo, that's where everyone played the game because the Genesis version was so borked, you know with the control scheme. So again, there might be more to it or there might not, there clearly isn't with Street Fighter V because that's a PlayStation game but and a PC game, but that made sense to me too, I mean that's where I played Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II Turbo, Super Street Fighter II, like I played all those on Super Nintendo.
