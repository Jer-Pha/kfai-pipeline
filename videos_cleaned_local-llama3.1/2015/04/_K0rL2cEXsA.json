Yeah, it's fascinating because they start with a complete and total blank canvas, and their methodology behind it is it's like they don't leave anything behind. So, like, they have groups of volunteers that will walk through the entire event, looking for someone in the forest, and they'll make sure there's no nails, no screws, cigarette butts, anything left behind. They do go down and pick it up; it's really fascinating. But then the other fasc is they show how they have to store all the... infrastructure because it's so big, you have to",

I definitely I should try it at least once; the sound great, nothing can go wrong there's explosions you that you actually feel the wave from planes crashing, the biggest explosion of all time this sounds and and they don't forget they end it all by lighting a statue - a statue that they try to get",

Yeah, burn that burn that Rice rocket down; that'd be amazing. So Greg, I have a question for you. Yeah, is Burning Man a topic? I thought it might be there; I think it's already been discussed.

Yeah, it was right when I asked what CU - I'm fascinated by people who have gone to Burning Man because to me, there's something everybody who comes back says this: it changed their life and you got to go; you can't know it's impossible. There are certain things that are impossible to communicate like a DMT trip. You heard Joe? Oh right, I meant to say - it's like trying to describe a dream. You either are trying it or you're not, but you can read books, you can study it for 20 years and you can't comprehend the experience. Burning Man is like that: you can read the books, you can look at the footage, but no matter what - no matter how you're hearing about it.",

Is there no money at Burning Man, or is there just a section where it's not supposed to be money? The only thing you can buy at Burning Man is coffee and ice, to the best of my knowledge, okay. And then that's sold by... you know, by the organization, and beyond that, it's supposed to be barter - the idea gotcha. So you bring things to trade, kind of thing, yeah, yeah, that's the idea. But I think with time, you get like when I first started going there was more people really engaging in that and... and as time goes on, it seems like there's more looky-loos rather than participants. In the beginning, when they first started going out there, it was like you couldn't go unless you participated - you know, you were doing some type of artistic something. Have the rules right?

But I mean, I'm just fascinated by something that takes that amount of energy to plan and then go out and execute. Because there's a part of all of us that like, we just don't... we're not challenged like that on a day-to-day basis, right? And you don't know, and I'm speaking from what we've done in the last few months is like, you don't know what you're capable of unless you challenge yourself on that scale.
