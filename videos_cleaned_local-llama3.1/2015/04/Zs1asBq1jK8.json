Oh really? Mhm, the Google-owned online video behemoth which tried and failed to acquire streaming giant Twitch last year has watched the growth of esports with great interest and is looking to acquire broadcast content and talent within the industry blah blah blah they keep talking about how important all this stuff is to them and all that **** what's interesting is YouTube has already begun recruiting a formidable team with one source pegging the number at 50 engineers with expertise in the streaming industry, and that's a pretty big statement of intent. One source said blah blah blah they're going to talk way more about this at E3 on June 16th.",

Sorry, I stole this from a child today. Um, all right, so YouTube - it's going to have a Twitch competitor and they're going to announce it or talk about it at E3. They had YouTube Live for all these years, about four years ago, I think they launched it, and like they'd always do, like big music festivals and all that stuff. I think the first thing they ever did was uh some random sport that Americans don't play - cricket, or some crap like that, right? Yeah, they showed cricket, and then people were like \"they heard crickets\" and then oh, then gaming started so",

That said, um, I'm interested to see like what it's all about; I like Twitch, I'm not like crazy impressed by it, like I think that, uh, it is seems a little antiquated but it just seems a little, it's not the right word at all, but it's it's lacking you know, I mean like it's not consistent, YouTube's consistent um in my experience using it maybe not on the back end it's certainly not consistent but but on the front end it is very consistent and uh so I it makes you wonder like what they can do.",

Because YouTube is a more prolific platform; there are way more people over there. It makes a lot more sense inherently to be there. Twitch has to master VOD, which is good, but that is the more important piece of the puzzle. I mean, we see that with Colin and Greg live, where it's like if you're not there for the stream, you're kind of out, you know, especially if you're not a Twitch user or a Twitcher who pays to have more than a 14-day catalog, a back catalog. There are a lot of problems for them to solve. I think YouTube's going for the killing blow. I gotta be totally honest with you; like I don't think that this is kind of like a peacemeal thing.

YouTube has done it to countless companies already, um, you know, like look at like look at our low tolerance for something like Vimeo when we were trying to use Vimeo for like video on demand for Patreon users we were just like **** this **** like this **** sucks, you know what I mean, like it wasn't working for us or whatever. YouTube works and so we use it. If they can get to that point with streaming then Twitch is in a lot of trouble and I and I think that um moreover I I'm interested to see like how they approach the the Esports kind of you know goal in terms of the games that people watch, which is not only Call of Duty and stuff like that, not only Evo but more like mobas and stuff like that.

Yeah, it's to me it's that they just try to do Google has very few new ideas; they just have money to go in and buy other people's products and refine them.
