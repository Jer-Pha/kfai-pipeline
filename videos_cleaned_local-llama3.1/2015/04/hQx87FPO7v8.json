DLC so Mewtwo people are getting him today as of the day we're recording this you see but you're indignant about it because they're not getting him for the right reason what's happening it's like YouTube people are getting him for the right reason I just **** up as people know at there because I've talked about this before if you wanted Mewtwo you had to like register your Wii U and 3DS codes and you get him like a week early or whatever and then otherwise we have to buy him next week or in two weeks okay I never thought that they would have given him early and like I forgot I was like oh the last day to register is tomorrow and I was like oh that I would have to go home get my two coffees do all this I was like I don't want to do any of that so I was like I'll just buy it for $5 when it comes out and then it comes out later I'm like oh well I made a bad mistake I screwed up so I don't got Mewtwo I don't really care about",

I mean, I guess October is the next thing, but then that wouldn't make sense because making all these... I mean, it'll probably be like it's not like it's that probable characters. Sorry, there's probably other characters too, yeah, that's true too. But yeah, so I mean like it's not a public-facing vote right? Like you cast your ballot and I never know and it just goes out... Yeah, out of there they probably have the agreement locked up already. Exactly.

And now that's happening here, there was this rumor that uh Ryu from Street Fighter and Roy from Fire Emblem - let's get Roy back in there; he's a distinguishable Fire Emblem character number seven who uh who he was in Melee would come back, and then those rumors have essentially been like squashed, and just they're total nonsense.

But I can go on and on about the characters I actually want in the game. Um, Simon Belmont yeah, Simon Belmont would be extraordinarily awesome or Alucard or Dracula or whoever. Um, if you want to get like really nerdy, get Isaac in there, another more obscure Castlevania character but that would be pretty cool. Um, and uh, I mean when you when you explore like the first parties or the first party kind of content, they've done a nice job of exploring like getting the Villager and they even like Wii Sports Trainer or whatever.

You're so funny, you're like the only person who can't play anymore, no, I want to replace who do you want replaced? Like here's what I was thinking about this the other day: since it came to Wii U and 3DS, I've not seen one single solitary person play as one character and if you can tell me who that character is, I'll be impressed because I don't even think about him.

I like that thing was in Brawl, but I thought it was weird. It was **** weird. I was like, \"This doesn't make any sense.\" Metal Gear does have a Nintendo first-pedigree in the sense that Metal Gear was an MSX game first, but then it was on NES, and that made sense. But you know, the bigger thing was that when Nintendo clarified like any game character... I was like, \"This is exciting because it got my mind going of like are there other first parties smart enough to go to Nintendo and be like, 'You can use any of our characters.' Because if like that would be brilliant. Take all the assets from PlayStation All-Stars, like if don't.\"",

If so,\" it would be really smart for Sony to go and use any of their characters, like anyone you want. If you want to use Drake, that doesn't make sense; he's God-like. Yeah, like use Sack Boy; that would make him fit perfectly. That's great. Or Spike, but like he's not relevant. Sack Boy would be like, \"You know,\" and that would be brilliant. And I was wondering, it's the same kind of question we had with Minecraft when Microsoft bought Mojang: Is Microsoft smart enough to publish this on all the platforms at the same time? You have to wonder if Nintendo is smart enough to be like, or is Sony and Microsoft smart enough to go to Nintendo and be like, \"You know our\"",

I love playing this great game, um, because you have to buy like GameCube controllers and all; it's just an expensive game to play, very yeah. When we were in Toronto, we were playing on Wii Nunchucks, like I, I can't play like this, you know? GameCube controllers are cheap now though, on Amazon, for the first time ever, they're like $25. Oh, can't believe it; because they were like skyrocketed for a while. So for $75 you too can play with your friends yeah, it's totally worth it.",
