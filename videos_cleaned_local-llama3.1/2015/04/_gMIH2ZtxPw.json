Fourth quarter if you want to go ahead and tweet topics for the Kinda Funny Gamescast, tweet them at me @TimGettys or every week I'll just ask you and you'll tell us stuff and it's going to be a good time. Just like Brian asked, why does Nintendo hate Metroid? It's a good question. I think that people often lose sight of something that is important when you're making a game. So what we talk about with Zelda too, although Zelda is not a great example of this. Metroid doesn't sell that well and like that, and that's the thing we lose sight of as hardcore engaged gamers and Nintendo fans. I love Metroid, um, but Metroid Prime wasn't like this blockbuster hit at all, so and they made three of them, so it's like I think they actually might have even started selling worse. So they don't make Metroid games because look at their books and they're like well we can have Retro do that or we can have Retro make Donkey Kong Country.",

Second of all, why would you make them want to make Jack and Daxter when they should be making Crash Bandicoot? Exactly. Well, they don't own it, of course, but they don't make Jack anymore because Jack was a diminishing return, and there have to be business realities when you're making a game, when you're spending tens of millions of dollars, if not 50 or 100 million dollars on making some of these games. Um, not that Metroid would cost that much; it's just that when you look at Metroid sales figures, they're just not that impressive. That series doesn't sell that well. I know that's like a surprise to people because I love those; I love the games on GBA and DS; I mean, they were great, but and obviously the NES and SNES Classics and Metroid Prime games. It's just you have to make it's the same reason why they don't make Up Zero. Mhm. You know, like who's buying",

Mhm, you know, like who's buying Star Fox? Well, they're going to make Star Fox so wait that's a surprise to me, like why do you... why are these... why does Metroid not sell well because it's kind of like it's just obscure. It's not I mean it's not Halo, you know, it looks like it kind of is but it's not and it doesn't have the multiplayer aspects and it doesn't have all these other things so it's like you don't get that the 13-year-olds talking about Metroid the way that you get them talking about Halo or Call of Duty type of stuff. So, and it's like yeah all of us are like oh we love Metroid why aren't they making Metroid but it's like then people aren't playing it like we're playing it when was the last good Metroid was it Metroid Prime three? Three okay yeah okay yeah I'm looking I was just on my phone CU I'm looking it says so",

CU, I'm looking. It says there are 12 Metroid games and the Metroid series through 2012 has sold 17 million copies. That's nothing. They can make a Mario Galaxy game and sell half that much. So it's a matter of like you know... 12, you know... 17 divided by 12, that's going to be about 1.4 million copies a game. It's just not really a return, and especially when all of them are just critically loved. I think you said there were seven of them? No, there's 12. 12! Yeah, holy **** 12! Alright, so there was Metroid one, which is great. It's Metroid on NES, which is a great game. Metroid 2 on the Game Boy, which is a pretty damn good Game Boy game.

I love Metroid; I hope they get some **** fix. I was so hyped for Metroid Other M too, like everything about that looked cool - the trailer was awesome, like an action game, all that stuff. I was like, \"First person, third person, hell yeah!\" And then it was just like all the story elements really, and just the fact that it was on Wii so the controller... you had to hold it this way and then this way and do all that stuff. I think that game would have been way better if it had a better story direction and didn't ruin Samus's character, and if it was on an actual controller. What the hell is Nick Reed? Um, all right, uh... don't I mean the solution right is to put out a throwback like Mega Man? Right, do Mega Man 9 or 10; do a 16-bit Metroid - Metroid Dread, yeah! Finally bring it out.

I don't think there could be another thing too, which is maybe that Retro just doesn't want to do it. Mhm, you know? Well, I almost don't want Retro to do it, like they did that three times, three and a half times, so it's like no stop all right. At Donald Jones says, \"If there were no exclusives, which Home console would you buy and why?\" So in a world with no exclusives, that really then comes down to controller power of the console, online user interface, and then online I am completely torn, yeah. Why like what tears you um Xbox? I would go for the I think the pros for that are they're online... and then we're talking about PlayStation, the UI is just very responsive which I like and then",

I think that's a really good parallel to it. You can play the entire game by yourself, and you will not know any difference. But if you want to play with a friend, maybe you can do that too. The only problem is that the game is going to be way more story driven than Borderlands, assuming you know, you assume, and so how they're going to work that out and all that kind of stuff remains to be seen, especially with choices for instance if like you play with a different player and you made different choices in the story and then come come to each other it's like that can affect it.
