Game of Thrones just came back. Um, we're joined by our guest, our lovely guest Alexis Pence. Hi guys, the resident Game of Thrones expert and all-around nice guy. I didn't watch the first episode. Yeah, no, you don't watch it; you read all the books. You can just tell us what happened, and nobody did. Uh, let's jump right into it though, guys. Um, I was excited about Game of Thrones coming back, obviously. Oh, at least somebody was. At least there was one person in America on Twitter that was excited about it, that's good to know. And luckily none of the episodes or anything like that leaked beforehand, so we're uh, you know, right up to the bitter end. We get there and uh, it's 8 what, 9 o'clock, I realized I don't have an HBO account. So, that was the funniest part. The stupidest guy \u2013 how did you not realize because I told my wife I'm watching Game of Thrones.",

But one thing I really did like about the show was how it opened with the Cersei flashback - that was beautiful, really well done. Here's my only gripe with that: I didn't like the girl playing CI; I didn't like the casting of her or the witch. I felt like the witch should have been looking grungier, maybe a little older, and then the girl just felt like a valley girl - I was like, 'Oh, you're like a girl.' I liked Cersei; I thought she nailed it. Like, I instantly knew it was Cersei, which I didn't know. I put it together and then told myself, 'I was like, \"Is that Cersei?\"' And then when it was revealed, you're like, 'Yeah, that's Cersei.'\"",
