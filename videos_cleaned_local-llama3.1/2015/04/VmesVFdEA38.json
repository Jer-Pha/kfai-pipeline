So Nick, do you have anything to say about Back to the Future? One is a classic, Back to the Future 2 was uh great, and I'm with you when I was a kid, I loved the hoverboard sequence. I was like, \"I want a hoverboard!\" This is the better movie, yeah this is awesome. I mean no it's cooler. It was a '80s thing, my parents' generation was the generation that goes back to 'cause I was when that movie was made, I think I was 5 years old, so my parents actually grew up probably during that time period, maybe a little later in that time period. Actually, you've heard the disturbing fact and it's now it's already past that if they did Back to the Future now and present day or whatever, they'd be going back like 1985 or whatever, like that's how old we are, how old that movie is right?

But um, no, I mean the second movie was good, and it's funny cuz my wife actually was one of the ones that brought it to my attention, she was like you know the first one was better right, and I'm like no way, way the second one had this and this and this, and Biff was in the future and all this stuff. And then you you watch them back to back and you're like oh you know what it actually has a lot more heart, it is the original um similar to how the Fast and Furious, the first Fast and Furious movie is the better Fast and Furious so much no no jokes though like good sequels, Fast Five, Six, and Seven, like they I okay we can't put them in the same league as the other movies we're",

I'm sure I'll be blown away; they do shuttles now that they didn't used to before. You had to just kind of get yourself there, but you can get shuttled in and out of it on a day thing if you want. Like, if you're like, \"I don't want to do this, I'm tired, sorry, I can't do this,\" you can get out fast. But that doesn't sound like it would get the real experience; that's getting the only way you could actually swing that because you can't predict traffic right? You could be stuck in eight hours on one road and not go anywhere. It's happened to me a couple times. But uh, the sure way in and out is you fly in and out, you know, 'cause they got an airport there, there's a Black Rock City Airport basically. Yeah, but I did see a plane crash there and it blew up; you know, because it's high altitude right? I definitely should try it at least once; this sounds great.",

Shakespeare's downtown location is included in that area and would be protected from demolition. This pisses me the **** off. Why isn't that what you wanted? No, I don't want that.
