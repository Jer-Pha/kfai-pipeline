We all know how I feel about bumblebees. No, you don't like bumblebees. So we're going to take care of him real quick. Mega Man X takes place 100 years after the events of the classic series and X is a robot that was created by Dr. Light before he died. Um, and Dr. Light fearing I guess that the robot was too powerful or people would do bad things to him like say Dr. Wily uh hid him away in a bunch of different capsules, pieces, and parts of him. Mhm. Um, and X itself is just a robot but there's all these upgrades that you find in the game as as people know and so archaeologist named Dr. Cain finds the capsules and X is revived and of course the story is a little deeper than that there are",

Not the coolest, so this is Storm Eagle, this is Armored Armadillo, this is Launch Octopus. Nick, can we just appreciate this chill penguin? Flame Mammoth, flame Mammoth. Boomeranger, Sting Chameleon, and Spark Mandrill. Damn, they look dope. And I always like this. I didn't realize this until I was older that you could... you could use this a spec. You can see their stages by collecting Sting that, and then you can actually go to the map and see like where they are in the area, co in the world. So we're going to go to CH. Looks sick as ****. Chill Penguin again. How did you know to go with him first? It's just one of those things.\"",

It's just one of those things; one of those things you figure it out. You start fighting different enemies, and it makes sense, and then you jump in, and it makes a little more sense from there. I think you go to Storm Eagle, and then you go to Flame Mammoth if I remember correctly. Um, well, so you know back in the classic series, you were saying that it makes somewhat sense sometimes. It does in the first one; it definitely makes more sense than in all the other ones I think because it is a rock-paper-scissors thing. Uh-huh. In the first one, you fight with Bomb Man; bomb used against Rock, Rock used against Scissors, Cutman used against electricity like cutting his wires. The wires are used for electricity, which is used to melt the ice, which is Ice Man, and then the ice is used to quench the flames of Flame Mammoth.",

Yeah, something of that Boom! The Mand exactly, exactly right. Okay, got it, got it, got it. A little less sensible in this one; it makes sense sometimes, like in Mega Man 2, using metal blades on basically everyone. But like metal blades work on Wood Man for instance, that's true, that's a good point. And then when you get away from kind of the traditional enemies, it does start to make a little less sense because like what are you supposed to magnetize against, hard science really? Yeah, exactly, sence I remember I remember this for some reason. Like it keeps respawning. The wall jump mechanic is so awesome; it is different.",

Rush does rush ever come in the X series? Uh, no. Uh, there's no like Rush X, no. Sigma has his own dog, um. But as far as I remember, no, I don't remember that. So when does Bass get involved? Uh, Bass and Treble are in the classic series; they're in Mega Man, and Bass is the game that they're introduced in, which is... what everyone used to call Mega Man 9 until Mega Man 9 came out, and that was a very late Super Famicom game that was released on GBA later. And that's when we first got it. Mhm, really. Mega Man: Bass was first on NES, uh, super, very it was very late; I think came out like '98. Um, and there's even some boss crossover.

You can go back to his stage at any time, and you're going to once you get Flame Mammoth's weapon. I feel like this game is designed around that then. So when you're saying backtracking, you're not even just talking about backtracking within the level playing; you're talking about you get more powers, then go back. That's crazy!
