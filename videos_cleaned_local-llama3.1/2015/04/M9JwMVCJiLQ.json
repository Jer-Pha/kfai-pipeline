The Matrix Reloaded - oh man, really going back... wait, no, Enter the Matrix, yes, the one that was totally like rushed, it was rubbish, everything but I had so much fun going into like slow-mo bullet time and like shooting people up. And say that, and I put way too many hours into Perfect Dark Zero - you wanted that game to be good so bad. Alfredo play like 60 hours of that MP was terrible, it was such a waste of time. I spent so much time on it; he bought the books, he read all the books, he was like, \"Dude, the story's good, I swear the story's good.\" It's like... I don't think the story's good, Alfredo, you're lying to me! Yeah, but yeah, I remember you played that a lot more than I should have played it. Something tells me Colin that you have a treasure trove of guilty pleasure games - just because I don't talk about them doesn't mean they don't exist.",

I have a ton, I have a ton of guilty pleasure games just because I don't - I talk a **** mean game about more casual games, more touch-centric games, but when they come to a platform I actually want to play then I'll start playing them. So like the Vita is a good example of like games that like um like Men at Work Mayhem or N.O.V.A. Attack or something like that where it's like these are these are like very iOS games that like N.O.V.A. Attack, please explain. N.O.V.A. Attack is a game where you play as nuns and they're all like holding like machine guns and stuff like that, like different guns, and you're like just using the touch screen to like direct them to fight enemies. That was surprisingly engaging game, but what's so funny and it shows my own hypocrisy in a way is that there are iOS games that were ported to a platform that I actually want to play, so I play them, and so once you get trophies",

Like of my favorite games of last generation is Plants vs. Zombies, and I wouldn't consider that a guilty pleasure, but that is a casual game. Um, that introduced a lot of people to what we know as Tower Defense, but they didn't they never had played a game like that before. Um, so there's a lot of games like that especially on Vita that I download for two or three or five dollars and uh and go crazy with it. Um, and so but my My ultimate guilty pleasure game is is Naughty Dog's Naughty Bear for sure, naughty cuz I authentically love that **** game and that's like not a joke you know like I love that game but it runs at like a solid five or six frames a second and it's solid though uh it is a solid yeah the frames you're seeing are definitely solid frames but I'm trying like",

I don't remember what it was...King Kong? There was a lot of y...I played King...that was one of the easiest ones I remember. Yeah, that was easy. Avatar: The Last Airbender game was oh yeah, the one you just hit B for like seven minutes? It was you get like 1k in gamer score that was simple. I would literally just get it in like play it for a super short amount of time and then send it right back out. Yeah, no...just yeah...it was like 'Why am I doing this?'
