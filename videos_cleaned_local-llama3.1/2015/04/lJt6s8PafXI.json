Host Greg Miller, Nick Scarpino, Tim Gettys - the one uh it is out thank God. Thank you for saying it I was dying having to watch a shaky cam footage trying to figure out what the hell is happening cuz literally this morning you came in we were talking about on calling Greg live and you were like no I think that the C like you're like I think they purposely made it blurry right when it got to Ben Affleck and then it blurred out. We lot people on Twitch scream yelled at me today live every I don't think that's the way it was. I think the camera just lost focus yeah I thought the same thing but then when I watched it the first time I was like did they do that on purpose cuz it was really weirdly timed right I knew they didn't do it on purpose like I I had that thought though but I was like so I don't think Greg's crazy okay okay so now we've",

We've never seen a Batman that actually looks like the Batman from the comic books, yeah, like Jim Lee-drawn Batman. Yeah, this really looks like Dark Knight, Dark Knight Returns style things. And even all the different hearing the reporters and stuff reminded me of The Dark Knight, where it kept cutting back to all the news reports stuff. That's the thing, I mean Tim, what did you think of the trailer overall? It was cool, like honestly, Batman v Superman overall, I'm excited for it just because that's awesome, that's something that I'd be into.

I don't think it's a cult, I think he's in the third world country doing something and these people all run up to yeah they all want to touch him because they think he's God, like I saw I just saw flashing lights back there so that doesn't make sense.

I always talk about the fact that you know we I feel like I me person personally right being a DC Comic fanboy, I don't get these movies and so when I do and they suck and they don't take chances, I'm like H I'd rather see them take chances. This is Superman story, we don't see a world that doesn't trust Superman. It does look like you know we're looking at the screen right now of the statue in the darkness slowly coming in on it, and to me this speaks to what we had talked about, what I had been predicting forever: you see a crane back here they've rebuilt Metropolis from Ground Zero, they put up this Superman statue thanking him but now there's this whole you know this is how Lex takes over.

I love that there are moments in this that really got me though, like the first time we actually see Affleck move in the Bat suit when he's coming out of the wreckage of whatever he's just blown up, and he looks like Batman. I mean, he looks like how Batman should look; he looks like Jim Lee Batman-ing, like he could break someone's legs on the planet with the extension of Superman. Um, I like that. I love all the call backs to The Dark Knight Returns right there, where... I love that shot right there, the shot where we actually see him in the electric Titan-like power suit armor that he's got, staring up at Superman, and then we get the line which we're still not sure if he actually says or not; we're assuming it's \"I'll show you a god\" if you crank it.",

God, that shot though! I'll be honest though, that shot right there where it's the shot reverse shot of him looking up into the sky and Superman's looking down at him and Batman's just like this is gonna go my way, you just look at the look on his face, it's like you think you're going to beat me, it's not going to go that way cuz I'm Batman.
