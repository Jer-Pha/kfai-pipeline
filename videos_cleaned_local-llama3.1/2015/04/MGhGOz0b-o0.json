Finally, uh, but this is State of Decay not quite as you would remember it on Xbox 360 or PC when it came out a couple of years ago. Yeah, the one year later survival edition so this is the uh yeah the one-year later survival edition that is available on Xbox One and PC comes from Undead Labs via Microsoft and uh of course our friends at Microsoft uh gave us this code to test out the game and we do very much appreciate that yay um so Greg you had a lot of experience with this game on Xbox 360 right, we played a lot of it as Let's Plays and I brought it home, played a little bit and you liked it and I liked it too when we went to a Microsoft Event earlier this year we played this Year One Edition um and we enjoyed it very much um so what we did here was um we played through kind of just the beginning portion of the game like the first.",

Earlier this year, we played State of Decay Year One Edition, and we enjoyed it very much. So what we did here was play through kind of just the beginning portion of the game, like the first 10 or 15 minutes, to try to get into a more meaty, substantive part of the game where we could open up the map and get back to... we're gonna get her back to the house, and then yeah, you get to go out eventually and start your own journey. So the nature of the game, Greg, if I'm remembering correctly, is that it's a zombie game, like many other zombie games, open-world kind of game, but the idea is that you're basically surviving and having a group of survivors, and finding little bases, and what I always was kind of taken by with the game is that you're able to go into every building and openly and freely explore even.",

Now, do they ever get into what happened in this game? Obviously, one of my big problems with The Walking Dead is they never talk about what actually happened. Do they go into the war or how this outbreak began a little bit? I mean it's more of the focus on like... if you're playing it right now and stuff, the focus is mainly Staying Alive, getting houses, taking care of business, you know what I mean? The hordes of zombies that are out there and doing that. It's not you know a very narrative driven game; it's more about like what I love about it is the same thing you're talking about right - going when you go into town, right, and you start going up onto water towers and looking out and seeing all the different places you go there, you scavenge them, and you add them to your log, and then you start building.",

Right, yeah, I mean obviously the textures have been updated. There was a whole story about how there were a bunch of penises drawn on the walls and stuff that they didn't know about when they put out the original State of Decay because the textures were so low. But after they figured out that there were penises in the Xbox One version, they had to remove them. So it's State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition - minus the penises edition, as well. Right? Yes, State of Decay is a survival game, and you'll find it on the Xbox store or PC - it's coming to PC, yeah. Exactly, yeah. So the graphical fidelity is a little higher, obviously the textures are higher. It seems like the frame rate might have been improved, and I think the draw distance is actually one of the great things as well.",

You know it's an undead Labs did this; they're a small studio, they're out there doing their thing and you know it's not it's obviously not going to win awards for being the best looking game but for being an open world zombie game where you can go out have fun tear things apart that's pretty awesome. It's funny because I think our very own Greg described this game as beautiful before, and I was I was uh I never heard I never heard I had never heard that word described describe but Greg makes a good point as like what you know like gamers and stuff right?

Think going out there into the wilderness and play the game - it would be kind of cool to be able to like play with different people in the same crew or whatever, I guess, but not that I would want to do that, but I think a lot of people would enjoy doing that. Um, but so no, so a single-player slanted game with some online leaderboards which is pretty cool. Obviously, a whole new slate of achievements even if you earn them on Xbox 360 or PC - um, you should be able to get them again.

These zombies are just standing in the water, and you kind of have to wonder why they're dead, man. What do they know? They don't know what to do. Why are they just standing in this water in this shallow pool of water? They don't, and they're just waiting... but they're waiting for what - that's the next noise, the next noise to chase you. You know how zombies are; I do know how zombies are, it's true. So with the kind of influx of zombie culture the last few years, does this game feel a little tired to you at all?

Yeah, who's calling with the zombie word play a little bit of wordplay now? The map's pretty extensive too. I don't remember the exact terminology they told me when we played the game at a preview event not too long ago, but there is some sort of in-game mile metric to the map and it is pretty big, sure.
