Affordable Space Adventures was in there. There's no such thing as Timeable Space Adventures by Nap Knock Games. Anyways, we have to pick who's going to be what now. I am Nav (Nav is not clear, but it seems like Nick said \"I am Nap\" and then corrected himself). Okay, so he's the Navigator. We got Navigator, Operator, and Science Officer. Let's just figure this out. This who sounds like the best? Clearly Greg is not going to be a Science Officer because you are I think maybe Greg should be Navigator.
