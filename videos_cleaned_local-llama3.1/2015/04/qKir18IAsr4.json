I don't know how to have sex, Nick. Okay. If only there was a video game that would teach me how to have sex. So, you I'm going to preface the rest of this play with I don't know what we're about to play. Do you know how to have sex? I think I've done it once. I think I did it right once. I've done it wrong a bunch of times that I can name. Okay. Um, specifically that I don't think any act is supposed to be that short. Mhm. Um like when it's shorter than a quick 15-second commercial. It's not probably doing it right. Right. I like how you have to say a 15-second commercial instead of just saying 15 seconds. It's shorter than that. I don't know. I don't know what I never counted it out. But like you have to stare at the clock and just see if you can beat your best time and then you",

You can't really never really know. But do you round up? I always round up. I round up in everything. Height, length, girth. I think we're both going to learn a little something today about ourselves. And about each other. Okay. All right. So, this is a program. This screen is terrifying. Yeah. Is this a real game or is like is this designed to teach kids about this? Well, this is this is a reference to Titanic. There's a boat only. It's two female dolls. No, that's definitely a male.

What should we do to Well, it's it's telling us to use some keys here to rotate the dolls. Got it. And we have we've met Rose and Jack who are the protagonist in there in the car on the Titanic. It was a Titanic reference. Clowns don't go in cars. They were hugging all like All right. Here they Oh my god. I don't have Mommy like that. This is ridiculous. And what?
