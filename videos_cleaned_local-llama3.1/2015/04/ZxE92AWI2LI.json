This is the weird dichotomy of the stories: these really nice older women are sitting around this table, and we're kind of encroaching a little bit on their space but they're slowly getting up. I sit down in someone's seat, and I'm like \"oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to\" - she's like \"oh, don't worry about it,\" we're leaving, and she puts her hand on my very warmly puts her hand on my arm, and it's like \"I you know, like please sit you know.\" We're getting out of here, and I was like \"oh, like really nice, what a nice old lady.\" Uh, so they that that crew of ladies leaves, and we sit down around this table, and there's this older blonde woman, maybe in her 50s, very well-dressed, hot.",

And the funny thing is that my like the five of them are kind of just engaging with her and and trying to be nice, and I'm being like really **** rude to her. And what I realized was that like she was being the nicest to me because I was challenging her or whatever. But she would do things like she went and shook Cheryl's hand instead of hers - like wasn't firm enough, whatever. And like, was she wasted or no? God damn, this is very intrusive.

But um also just kind of recount this story. I don't think I'm leaving out anything too too important because the reason I wanted to tell the story was to ask like if you've ever had encounter encounters like this overseas, and why we're looked at is like such a bad group of people to like some people I think most people know Americans are just like you and and in in England or in India in Japan like it doesn't matter.\"",

Um, which could you imagine if that were the case here, where if every country we had a problem with we were just rude to the people from that country, our country would be chaos, it would be chaos.
