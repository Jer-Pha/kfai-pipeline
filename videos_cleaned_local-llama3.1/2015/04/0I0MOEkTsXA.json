We got the coolest dudes in video games reunited for the first time, and it feels like I shook him into another dimension. He was straight T-Rex. I liked that man; that's just how cool you are, Colin Moriarty. Well, some might say that yeah, you were out in Iceland. I hear it's cold there. It's frigid absolutely frigid. Yeah, as the name suggests. Yeah, wait, was it really cold? Yeah, it was freezing hard. I thought I thought it was the green one. There it was, Baffin Island. I thought Greenland was Greenland and Iceland are supposed to be backwards; throw you off. Where I was is the northernmost capital city in the world, and... uh, shows yeah. Every time you walk outside, and then Greg Miller: \"Hey, who must be happy?\" The first time we seen Colin in like a week and a half, I had to eat my yogurt and shame again today this morning.",

No, I was like, \"Head Cold,\" I was like, \"That's a thing.\" All right, cool. Yeah, you've ever heard that? No, never had a head cold before. Like, you're all congested in your head and you can't hear anything. But what's the difference between that and just a cold? A cold is super congested, that's like the defining factor of a cold. I feel like you have a sore throat, you're coughing, you're sneezing... whatever. Head cold, it's all up here. You feel like someone in a NyQuil commercial. Oh, okay, I get what you're saying.

There's a reason to own both again. There's a reason for them both to be back at the same time. That's my one thing I was concerned about them flooding the market too soon. But based on what I saw of Guitar Hero, if Rock Band's just Rock Band, then it's like, oh okay, maybe this doesn't all blow up and kill everybody. Yeah, now my thing is, I'm a huge music game fan, like all three of those games. I'm super excited for them and I'm going to put a lot of time into specifically compared to how much time I put into most video games. Like I actually really invest in music games.

You know, so far at least, like they made sure they didn't say it was just on just guitar. We asked them, and they were like, \"Well, for now, we'll see.\" So but I can't imagine them adding other instruments like right yeah singing at the TV with people booing you and stuff like that yeah like that it just doesn't make too much sense with the game that they've created because of how complicated the guitar playing is. And what you're saying is like Guitar Hero 1 through three were very focused on guitar songs, like songs with crazy solos, and the the challenge levels and all this stuff, and it was it had this nice curve of you knew what you were getting if you played any song on easy, medium, hard, or difficult.

Colin and I have agreed that we are playing Rock Band in the living room at least twice a week or something with the girls or whatever, like we're getting use out of it so it isn't like when I bought DJ Hero and literally played it one night and never touched it again, you know. DJ Hero was kind of whack though; this was a great idea - the song matchups are awesome. The thing I'm most fascinated about these music games coming back is that I personally am very excited about it. What we have to remember about with Rock Band and Guitar Hero is that the games were never bad, it was just that we were tired of them so the formula still works.

The more interesting thing is that two Publishers Activision and EA have stumbled upon the same thing in the same year to bring back these franchises which is not a coincidence I don't think because I don't think they knew what the other was doing I think that they were reading probably similar research market research maybe using the same firms to discuss internally whether these games could come back and if they could be commercially viable and then struck at the same time um I think it's good that they're both coming back at the same time because uh the cream will rise to the top if one",

You didn't have a vision, it seems like Harmonix has always had a vision for Rock Band.

We all loved Rock Band; I can't remember the number of IGN Rock Band parties we had, and that wasn't limited just to IGN, that was every other thing mainstream.

I mean, that was the same thing, you know, because you also invested in these instruments, and stuff like that, and so you have to go, you know, some of them are cross-compatible, I guess, but ultimately, you had a kind of go where you were spending your money as well, and these were such investments. The bigger thing is that if there is backwards compatibility with the new Rock Band, and I'm not confident there will be because I don't think it's going to work, um, is that you can go to your local Goodwill or whatever and just pick that up for real cheap right now, like the minute that's announced, you know, make a move making bank off them 399 guitars.

Sorry, I can't let me tell you it's really sad I can't hear myself and my throat hurts. Uh, but there's like awesome baselines and I don't feel like they explored the rhythm as much as they could have considering uh, you know implementation of bass because drums did it so nicely um and bass it was it was just like it was a stepchild, the guitar and so I could play bass on hard like yeah I'm doing something on hard it was always just like who wasn't good at it.
