I'm joined alongside the coolest dudes in video games Colin Moriarty and Greg Miller. Hey, good to be here with you today. We got my boy Alfredo Diaz. Alfredo plays over on Twitch. Hi, how's your whole Twitch thing going? Good, good. Yeah, um, it's just fun. Good, it's just fun. What have you been streaming lately? H1Z1, just Random Encounters with people role-playing. Cool, it's been... what do you role-play as? Uh, I usually just pick people up and then from there, I kind of just force the situation, feel it out. You know, Fredo cab confession. Usually, it's just like, who were you in this life before the zombie apocalypse hit, and people give like random stories, and that's fun. That's cool. Yeah, yeah. What'cha guys decide about?

Because I thought maybe he was saying parsing like the peace meal approach to games, like the DLC kind of thing, that's kind of a read. The question does that fit in because we view that lens does it work? Okay... and the general lack of feeling of ownership over the games we buy these days. Does it still make sense to keep our games? I still have most of my games from the PSX forward and could play them at any time I wanted in 15 to 20 years. Will we be able to say the same thing for current gen consoles? Thanks, friends, keep up the good work. Yes... okay, I think he means parsing.

And I still think that like my Atari 2600 still works and my original NES from '85 still works but it's because it's not moving, it's not doing anything. So I think that you have to kind of look at it the other way in my opinion, which is that a physical media is going to die, it's going to die, it's going away forever and it's imminent and it's already happening.

And now I'm totally like, \"Well, thank God I don't have an SNES,\" and you know every system I ever owned following me around in a trunk, CU, I just don't have anywhere to put them. But it's just like for this guy right now, he's like, \"You know, in 30 years, what game are you going to want to go back and play?\" Like that, you know what I mean? And there's like we look at re-releases and we look at the e-shops, and they're going to be there in some respect. But it's you're more of a guy who wants to have every cartridge and every system and everything still there. Yeah, I mean, I think it's interesting to look at just games in general right now like they're so different than they used to be. Like before it was just the experience you can have, and that's it. But now it's like Halo 2 - it comes out, and they shut down the",

All Call of Duty games will never be the same, and uh, then you're seeing now like games like Grand Theft Auto V where they're taking songs out, patching it, adding new songs in - which is awesome - but then taking songs out, which is like, oh well, that kind of sucks. But I mean, I guess that's just the world we live in now, where it's like this ever-updating thing. I mean, my whole thing is, I play a lot of games, but I always... whether or not you agree with the whole trading in a GameStop system or how that goes, I always end up just trading games back in.

You don't think about it that way, just the cost to enter though yeah, you know. I don't know, I think that people just have to look at things in a more practical way which is that it's it's night like I have a **** **** ton of NES and SNES games in my house and I have all my PS1, PS2 games, games at home and all that kind of stuff but I don't expect that I'm going to go into my attic in 10 years and like plug that PS2 in and have like an experience on it.

Like, in a way, the digital revolution has been a blessing. It's just that you have to get the stakeholders and the publishers on board in a more effective way because games do disappear even from PSN and Xbox Live. Um, Turtles in Time, yeah, Turtles in Time is a good example. Because like, they need like especially the stakeholders, the platform holders need to just figure out licensing agreements that say like this isn't this is available in perpetuity if you put it on the platform, it's not coming down. You know. And I don't think that that's unreasonable especially if they're gonna be making millions of dollars which they will on on specific games there.
