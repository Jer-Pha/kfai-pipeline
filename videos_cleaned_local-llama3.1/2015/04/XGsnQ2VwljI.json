I think the idea is the recall of the arrow splits also splits them up so you have to like kind of recall the arrow in a more thoughtful way to not split the blobs up more than they need to be split up. Yeah, no, I know that. But I'm saying, do you think you can ever split the blobs so much that they don't split anymore? I'm going back all right. Uh, I don't... I don't Ian. I don't think that's the most effective way. Clearly, you've already got it down to the heart. Just get it, shoot the **** heart.
