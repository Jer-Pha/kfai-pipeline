I feel like I'm really going to like this game, but right now I'm in that place where you guys have played this so much in a few hours, you're really going to like this game more. Pitiful Shields, okay. I like that. Nice job, l... oh, all right! Yeah, that was me. Good, you already got a shield, don't worry about it. Oh no, no, oh God damn it! You don't have unlimited arrows; you've got to be careful and pick up other ones. Can you pick up the other people? You can pick up any color arrow. I love this game; I forgot how much I love this game. And the funny story of course is that Colin knows well, is that this was originally in one of those Ouya games... it was an Ouya game, and it was the one game everyone's like, \"Damn, this is cool on Ouya,\" and then everyone's like, \"Too bad it's not coming\"",
