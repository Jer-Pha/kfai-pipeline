If you have a topic for me, please tweet Nick Scarpino with \"Gog Topic\" in your tweet, just like we do every week; it changes and I love it. It's fine, just tell me it's a topic for Christ's sake or just ask me questions about Taco Bell... like Danica Patrick - she's hot off the set of her newest A Patrick one California Patrick. Ju says that think Scarpino, guys: what would you do if you woke up one day in Portillo's body? Also, how would you make other people believe it was you in that body? So we wake up as this... weener - you're just this guy right here. W up! Oh my God, I'd freak out! I'd freak out. You got a floor view of everything. Yeah, is Portillo in our bodies? Cuz that's the more terrifying. Oh my god. Well what's crazy about that Greg is...
