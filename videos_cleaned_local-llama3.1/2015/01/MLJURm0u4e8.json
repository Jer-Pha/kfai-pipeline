I'm pissed that you did the head thing, because I normally do the head thing. What head thing? What did he do? I always do the head thing. I always did it too, but then I forgot. I was smiling because this is like a special episode. You forget everything. And then you do the thing, and then you always nail the table thing. You never get the table thing. I never get that. You're bad at it. Hey guys, how's it going? It's a young man's game, the table thing. Over here! The Pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. It's good to be here. It's good to be here. Go Jets. Yeah, Go Jets. I think by this point everyone who's listening to this, Rex Ryan, would have been fired. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Over there, the Pier One, Tim Gettys. Let him host.

Yeah, if there were ever a time to start drinking, now would be that time. We should all develop an alcoholism problem right now. Ladies and gentlemen, you know there's a usual rigmarole to how the show opens here, you know, four, sometimes five. We'll get to all that in a second.

If you don't think we're worth the money or you don't have it, it's no big deal. You can wait and go to YouTube.com slash Kinda Funny Monday through Friday to get breakouts until the entire show is posted on YouTube and iTunes. There's also a store.

Right? Well, it's like we wouldn't have to wait for that show to get filmed to have this day to do that today. You can just have that as soon as the trailer drops. Yep. 30 minutes later you can have a conversation with Colin about it. That's where we thought that would fit. We can call The Conversation With Colin if that makes him feel better.

So why did we quit? We're doing all these things because we want to continue to have the conversation relationship. We started with you guys, the viewer slash listener. And the fact is, not many of you. And this isn't to offend you. I've put it together that when we worked at IGN, we couldn't talk about video games. We couldn't talk about current movies or TV.

It wasn't that we necessarily couldn't talk about those things. It was just that we were asked not to write. I mean, that was kind of an idea. That's another way of saying we couldn't do it. Yeah, well, you could kill Greg right now. It's not that it was a point. What you're saying is perfectly legit.

But when you think about the excitement level of kind of what we were doing there and now what we're potentially going to be able to do, it's just off the charts. It doesn't compare, right? We talked about it six months ago. We were like, wouldn't remember that conversation we had, we're like, what would it take for all of us to leave? Right? Like let's, let's figure out how much we're all making and like, let's, let's figure out our minimum numbers to walk away. And then we launched the Patreon and saw that there were actually people out there that, that would give a shit if we left and that all of that numbers and all that conversation about money just went out the window.

So we sat around Kevin Smith's like badass Colombian drug lord, like, lair that he has and talked to him for four hours. At the end of which, Colin leans over and goes, the entire time I was leaning on a second draft of Clerks that had handwritten notes from Scott Mosier on it and there was a picture of Kevin Smith drawn on it from Scott Mosier.

Yeah I agree and I think what's most exciting about it is that IGN has this huge reach and we've always been honored and thankful for that but we don't need that kind of reach to do what's satisfying for us and to satisfy the smaller group of people that want to kind of ride or die with us. Yeah the care about what we have to say. Which is I think what's so exciting like that's what's really invigorating to me is like I actually want to talk to a smaller group of people that like really care and really like that aren't there just because of a Stazzy headline or just there because it's the news of the day but because they want to know what we think about X, Y and Z and that's a smaller group of people than the millions",

Yeah, we're not giving you shit about what you order right; we're giving you shit because you make us order it for you and then come back with stories about pizza and tacos. You've killed someone; you regale us with these fucking stories. You've been on the phone talking to underdogs, and they have no idea what I'm saying when I say I want to side with us. Right? Meanwhile, I went home with my lady, my chick, and we crushed her, and I had four hot dogs literally the other day. She was like, 'For my birthday, all I want to eat is cereal.' So we got a box of Lucky Charms and a box of Golden Grahams, and we just ate cereal.\"",

Uh, what about a Quarter Pounder with cheese? Be considered a lean in no way, shape or form. You've seen him order this fucking Whopper with just the fucking patty. That's not even that's that's not even good for you. What you really want to do is if you guys want to shed weight eat wake up eat a chicken breast and some kale or a chicken breast and some broccoli, and just I think I'd rather that going like for lunch have a filet of salmon and some some carrots.
