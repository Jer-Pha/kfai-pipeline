Uh, we're trying to toy around this idea of having themes every day, so Thursday would be Throwback Thursday where we play a game that means something to us. And I thought why not start with one of the worst games of all time - Superman 64. Now if you remember Superman 64, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry you have to remember this game. Uh, my story with it is simple: it's the reason I bought an N64. I saw this in an issue of Wizard magazine, one screenshot, and I was like, \"I guess I have to buy an N64.\" And I got an N64 and waited and waited because this thing got delayed, delayed, and delayed - finally got it started playing it, and it was the worst thing ever. Now my luck's going to be different though. I have the Superman 64 strategy guide here from Brady Games, of course, written by Craig Wessell, who I don't know, and I don't know why I",

I'll get there eventually; probably going to fail this initial one, but now I think you can already see why people weren't a big fan of Superman 64, and it's inverted. Can I switch that thing? Uh, restart the mission display Cinema. No, oh here we go: story and controls. The story: catch me up on the story. Lex Luther traps Lois, Jimmy, and Professor Hamilton in a virtual world. Superman has no choice but to enter this world, rescue his friends, take off, land... Oh, this isn't right; can't I change them? I can only... oh Lord. All right, is this even the first one? There's one; can I get him out of order? Yes, maybe, or I'm just getting him really in order. All right, now I'm getting my groove for what is one of the worst games of all time.

Superman had mother... what I don't know what's happening, I won't lie to you guys, I'm not sure what's happening. I need to break out my BradyGames strategy guide here in a second, see what the hell's going on. So Lex traps Superman in a virtual world and rather than just kill him like Neo in The Matrix, he makes him fly through rings. Now granted, nobody knew what The Matrix was back then. Oh, oh there we go! And like so imagine... like you now we can sit here and we can laugh at it right? 'Cause there's been so many great Superman games since then. But the time I'm Greg Miller, all I've ever wanted is a great Superman game. Lex wins, that's it, that's the game. Oh, and like how it says start to quit, so it's like hey if you just this game, you just spend all",

Oh, and like how it says \"Start to Quit\" so it's like, hey, if you just this game, you just spend all this money on, go ahead and quit it. But I mean, it was heartbreaking on so many levels. First off, 'cause the animated series was great. Second off, 'cause I'd been waiting for a great what you know at the time would have been next-gen Super cool Superman game, and you finally get it, and you open... I mean, like I'm don't I was able to convince myself that I liked uh Superman Returns for a long time, and eventually it was like the fourth DVD showing I was like this movie sucks. This game I was able to immediately notice something was wrong with, and it was bad, and I only played it for probably a week before I was like no, or a weekend maybe even where I was like no, I can't; this is going back to the store. Even Greg Miller who bought it in a Superman shirt can't support it, like, and that's saying something.",

Oh God, because you figured out I'd stick up for Superman so many times, and then he finally gets an N64 game again - the game that pretty much motivated me to be like, \"I need an N64, and I need it now.\" And then wait two years because it took so long to get out, and then I get it, and it's just... it's a garbage p and... and then let's not even overlook the fact that it wasn't just a bad Superman game right? Like, it was... was so... I don't understand if I get penalized if I go through it because it seems like it's just letting me go. It's not even just a bad Superman game; it's one of the worst games of all time. Like, this isn't even a game people aren't even like, \"Oh no, it sucks.\" That game wasn't that good.

There we go. Then there's no time to waste. Yeah, there's no time to waste. Soup's on, we got it now. Hold on. Now I think it said R. Let me break if I hold B and R at the same time cuz it's just that you get this weird am I losing a lot of time? I'm not gaining time ever which is weird. Yeah, I'm not even going to try to get most of them cuz it seemed like I got in trouble when I skipped a few so now we're just going to go.

Yeah, we're not playing this now. It's slow and steady wins the race. Get in there, Superman! Did it? Oh go, Superman! You want to... oh Jesus Christ.

The sound effects are pretty dope man it's 'cause I don't have the rumble pack, but they delayed this game for so long and this is what they came up with here's Superman - a great animated series, a cool universe to build on. I should have just blown past it; I'm in a two-minute race if you didn't remember, so I'm glad that I get to redo this whole thing again then there's no time to waste.
