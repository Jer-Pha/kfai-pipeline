So, if you win a Golden Globe, people are saying, \"Oh, you're a shoe-in to get an Oscar.\" Sometimes it doesn't work out that way, but most of the time it does. So, it reminded me of all the great films that have come out this year. Uh, you got films like uh Interstellar. You've got films Interstellar talking about this year. Not Inception, excuse me.

Just right now specifically. Avengers: Age of Ultron. That's what I'm saying. Furious 7 is definitely number one. Furious 7, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and then it could be other stuff. Star Wars. Didn't he ask which was my favorite movie first though? Yeah, but we just jumped to the interesting part of the conversation. I mean, we can talk about What was last year's favorite movie?

Here's what I want to talk about for 2014 movies. Mhm. For me, as someone who doesn't watch movies often, it was finally the year of the digital movie where I finally got to watch everything on demand. I still haven't watched The Interview. I don't watch a lot of movies here. What's funny is you get what you ask for. North Korea hacked our Sony. Yeah. Instead of hacked our Sony and they are our Sony. They hacked our major motion picture studio and this big movie. Uh, do you guys watch the Golden Globes at all? No. No. Amy Poehler and Tina Fey had a great joke about The Interview where she was like, and we all had to pretend like we were",

I'm calling out an extent to Tim not cuz he's the pure one. The problem with watching movies is that I'm in a committed relationship, which means when I do have two hours where I'm like, I want to watch not a video game.

Um I haven't watched it yet. It's not on demand. No, it's not. I haven't watched it, but I'm familiar with it.

This hit on such a unique and just deeply sentimental note for me. Nice. And anyone that I know that's watched it was just like far and away best best most emotional movie of the year to me. Wow. It's so well done. And the style of it, cuz he uses miniatures for everything and like all the cameos of all the guys that he's worked with including Bill Murray and you know I mean Owens uh what's his name uh the guy looks like Fran. Oh Jason Schwartzman. Yeah, Jason Schwartzman. All these guys are in this and you're just like ah it's so and Wes Anderson is the main character",

Pay to watch it for Christ's sake. Give Wes Anderson some money. That's the thing about like I like I like Wes Anderson films in general. Like I said, for some reason I fell off. I think The Life Aquatic didn't hit for me personally. Like I I was such a huge Rushmore fan, you know what I mean? I like Bottle Rocket, too. Bottle Rocket is the best. And then it was one of those things of like for some reason it just deviated enough for me where I didn't keep up with it. And like I like the idea of I love when you find a director who has the the cast he loves and or she loves and they find new it's like a toy box, right? You put down this toy box and you put those people in different roles and do different things with",

And it's one of the reasons I love Kevin Smith, you know, stuff so much because he uses the same people over and over in different ways, does all these different things. Um I agree. And this is like and this is one of those where you can tell they all came on set and I mean even the guys that just come cameo like Bill Murray's it's he's in the movie but he's you know he's only there for a little bit. Yeah. Um he's fabulous. Like just phenomenal. And it's because he's just it's like when you call an old friend that's one of your best friends and you just pick up that conversation right from where you left off. Know how you talk to me? But like every single person in this movie is like that. And the movie is so weird and it's, you know, it's a movie. It's it's Kevin Smith",

It's it's a person retelling the story as he's like coming to it uh as he's visiting like the hotel the Grand Budapest Hotel like now um and being told the story of it of its uh famous uh concierge which is Gustave. Uh I got to work on my Jeff Goldblum at all. Anyway, I I don't want to go on and on about it or to spoil it. It is a very singularly unique movie and you should all watch it. Before we move on, was 22 Jump Street this year? I think it was. I gotta give a shout out to that. It's definitely not movie of the year, but man, that franchise that franchise is something special. Have you caught up on this? No, I haven't. I haven't watched the movie. I mean, you remember the first one? No, I never saw the movie. I saw the first one and I I was let down.

By the time I watched it, I think my expectations were set so high because that's the thing - going into it was one of those ones where I was like, \"All right, this is a shitty comedy movie.\" We went into it just like, \"Oh my god, it's so funny.\" I think it's extra funny for us because we make videos and we make comedy and like we try to do that. Try to make comedy and like so many of the jokes are so meta and just so like kind of breaking the fourth wall and just like joking about the writing and joking about that stuff. I just think it's so funny and like The Second one it's like it took itself so not seriously as a sequel. Like, it took that whole idea very self-aware. It was self-aware and like ah it was so good.

It doesn't feel like the same movie. They waited too long. They don't have the chemistry anymore. You can see there was some I don't know if it's infighting or maybe they're just slowing down a little bit. It was the fact that they had gotten older and that's something I remember very distinctly them talking about on that Oprah episode. I remember when I remember I had a bone to pick with Oprah because she wouldn't let me in to see Ghostbusters in person and that was one of the things I remember in that interview they talked about is the fact that we've all gotten older and none of us smoke and you know we're all a little bit bigger and we're all a little",

Yeah. Do it before like even Channing Tatum now, he's evolving. Like this movie Foxcatcher that he was in, which was um an interesting film. I'm going to say interesting.

Uh, Day-Lewis Craig. That's true too. Um, the hell was I just talking about? Channing Tatum. Tatum. You talk about Channing Tatum; he's unabashedly like he's very humble. I've read multiple interviews with that guy who's like \"I don't know how to act.\" I don't know why people like me. I'm just excited it's happening and I'm going to ride this until it crashes to the shore. I'm familiar with that.
