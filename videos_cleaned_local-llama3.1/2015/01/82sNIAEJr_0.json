Maximo on PS2 came with heart boxers. Oh, you did? Yeah, I really do feel like with rare exception it was that generation - the PS2 GameCube Xbox generation - that began it. I mean, there were examples, but then I think about the games I was passionate about as a kid on N64 and SNES. I would have murdered for an ActRaiser special edition. You kidding me?

All that stuff and that's when things got crazy. But I still feel like people bought into it, and people definitely bought into it. Um, the last collector's edition my friends were excited for was Halo 3, which came with the Master Chief mask that you couldn't wear but like you can put on; yeah, exactly. Um, you ever put on a cat? No, yeah, it's not actually cat-sized. Um, this is what we all called it; I know, but yeah, it wasn't really...

And then I have like six Mega Man cartridges from the Famicom, and some other stuff, and that's it, mhm. And everything else just goes in a box at this point, yeah.
