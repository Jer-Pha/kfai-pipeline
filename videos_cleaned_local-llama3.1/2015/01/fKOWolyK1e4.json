He retains his strength, so it's not proportional; it's the opposite of proportional. No, 'cause an ant has the ability to lift like a thousand times its own weight. This is what I'm saying, so it's like an inverse proportion \u2013 like the smaller you are, the more strength you have. That makes more sense anyway.

Um, but it was just cool that they were there. And but that was like for me, that was the natural evolution of the arcade board right, like because I remember my first game that I was addicted to on SNES was Street Fighter Super Street Fighter II (yes, Street Fighter 2, excuse me). Um, and that had I was like how am I going to go from six buttons here, and oh this the fierce buttons are on the top, that was dope. And I I remember I used to play I tell people this like when I played Street Fighter 2 or Street Fighter II turbo or whatever I'd play the game I'd play it with my my pinky on top because I would never use the face buttons I would only use the fierce buttons in the thing and so like you.",
