Video games, DC's kind of killing it; they got the Arkham games, and they're excellent. Marvel games, what's up with them? My question to you guys is how do we fix that? What developers would you give? Oh, I know that picture nailed it; that's a classic. What developers would I give? First off, I think you're being a bit broad with DC's \"I guess\" killing it; no, you're right, 'cause they got the Arkham games. I'm going to throw in DC Universe Online because it's annoying and it's good, and Injustice. So I take back what I was about to say; you're right. But the way I see it is the Arkham games seem to be building towards eventually Justice League; eventually you know what I mean, that type of stuff, and like that seems very feasible and seems logical specifically with the movies going that direction too. Now with Marvel movies we're at the Ant-Man point, at this point the Ant-Man.",

Spider-Man could easily be that. Give it to anyone who's got an open world pedigree, you know what I mean? Spider and that's the other thing I'm talking about with superhero games is give it to him and then every three months release a pack of random crime to go stop and then put a new villain out or something, you know what I mean. Like something, something simple and it can be an hour of content as for in terms of like this little storyline to get to the guy to fight him or whatever. Like at May Pharmacy ones exactly.

Yes, but uh I think that Marvel Heroes has this moment. I think you know it's a matter of focus, and I think it's a matter of again like Greg was alluding to finding the right developers for the right products. And I think um I personally think the Wolverine game that Raven did was awesome, and I I I really like that game a lot. Um, and I think Raven's - I said many times one of the underrated studios.

But it's like, sure, our books tell us that you want it so here it is and Actvision is doing the same thing. I mean, for Ubisoft, partnering with someone we were talking about it earlier today on the Twitch stream, give them a Daredevil game - Matt Murdock on rooftops having to use sonar to see what's happening, go out and fight crime that'd be awesome because you have the same thing of doing like dives. You know, I mean, I'm taking Assassin's Creed engine, taking some of the Watch Dogs stuff, merging it together, putting one...

To get a **** end of that game through the controller through the window, you know what I mean? Like there were issues about that. But like Deadpool is about to get his own movie with Ryan Reynolds again, you know what I mean? Like that's fan service - that's another one of those fans are demanding it and demanding and demanding if it doesn't perform at the movie theaters, shut up about Deadpool everybody.

Yeah, I feel like similar similar to the movies, if they were to come out with an Iron Man game to start it off, it's just like here's this super awesome game, the Arkham of Iron Man. Yeah, I think that would be huge; that would could start this whole boulder rolling of just like, \"Here's a series of great games that are about to come.\" Yeah, but it's not... Greg's point, I agree with it. It could be anything, that's the thing. Is it could be anything? I mean, Batman's obviously a big name, and that was Arkham Asylum, which was a game that came out in 2009 and was beloved by a lot of people.
