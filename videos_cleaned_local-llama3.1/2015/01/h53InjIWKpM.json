If you don't know VidCon of course ladies and gentlemen is basically GDC for YouTube creators, it's a YouTube conference, you go there, you learn about YouTube. I went there because I was lucky enough to be hosting a show over on IGN's Stay N' A' While Channel called Up at Noon and I knew nothing about YouTube so I went there and you always say that I came back like I was an apostle and I had the flame",

You were absolutely right; yeah, well clearly we quit our jobs to come do YouTube. I hope... um, well you were right, and you know, yeah I was skeptical of the idea but it was a thing we were just doing for silly reasons on this side, and you know those early Conversation With Colin episodes are funny and stupid, just like this episode. I was going to say these this episodes and uh we're just a little bit older, yeah, and uh I I I became really enthralled with it because I realized you know that there was a lot I didn't know about it and that I needed...

Like, I didn't want to do that; ultimately, I didn't want to do it at all compared to what we were doing on YouTube right. And while I'm thankful and blessed for what we were able to do at IGN for all those years, and always remember the people that gave us those opportunities, and always really appreciate that - um, and always rep that side forever of course. Um, I realized that what made me really happy was having a little bit more control over what I was doing, and giving like just cutting the middleman and going directly to the people who wanted it to enjoy our stuff, and um, we were able to slowly build to that over time when we introduced the Game Over Greggy show, Oreo oration, and comic book Origins, and all these kinds of things.

You already hit on it, right? It's like we have a connection directly to you. There is no middleman. I love the fact that whatever we do, if it succeeds or fails, it's because of us. At no point can I sit there and be like, \"Oh well, this would have done so much better if...\" And then be like, \"Well, you know, it didn't get cover placement\" or \"this happened\" or the tweet didn't go. If I say any of that stuff, it's on us. One of us here screwed it up, and it's like it's equal parts exciting and terrifying because then there's like nothing but... I know the way we all work is that we won't do the failures; it'll only be the successes. And if something isn't working, we will fix it immediately. We'll fix it like that.

I mean there's a part of collaborating in a giant group at IGN that's amazing, right? You get we get so much more diverse opinions, do so many different things. But having it be just us and knowing how we all feel is great, and that makes us have a vision and able to go do something. Yeah, I mean the fact is that we're just smaller and we're Nimble, and I think that that's nothing but beneficial, yeah, to us it's nothing but beneficial to people that enjoy what we make.
