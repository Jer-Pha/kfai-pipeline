And uh, there's a lot of things going towards this right now, like last week one of the composers of Rare's music, yeah, said that 2015 is going to be a really big year for them. And then now this Microsoft dude, he's saying like, \"Dude, Banjo-Kazooie, Battletoads, Perfect Dark - Viva Pi\u00f1ata\" they're going to come someday; they're just trying to find developers passionate about the projects. This is cool, it is cool. I have questions about it: it's clear what IP they own and what IP came with them when Microsoft bought them, and what didn't. What I'm most curious about is especially like their most prolific output in terms of games made was during the NES; they made like 25 games, and a lot of people don't realize that for some reason. Yeah, what were some of them? I mean, their biggest games on NES were Wizards & Warriors, but they did like Cobra Triangle and Snake Rattle 'n' Roll, and like they did a bunch of",

Are long dormant. So can you imagine seeing a trailer for Xbox One Wizards & Warriors that be awesome, like that be insane, that would be like a it would be so cool like a uh like a almost like a MOBA or something you could do like whatever you wanted with that but it's but they're going to have problems cuz Rare is talent I mean they're still very I don't mean to disparage people are rare they're very talented over there, but the talent that made those games that people love are long gone and uh then it's just an empty shell right of the title and then it's trying to live up to that that's the problem.

Yeah, and everybody was leading up to \"GoldenEye's back\" - yeah, and nobody cared when it came out. You know what I mean? Well, that wasn't Rare though; that was the opposite side of the issue. Um, yeah, I mean Killer Instinct people like that, you know, like the fans of it, yeah, are into like Dustin. Dustin loves Killer Instinct, sure. But did Rare do Killer Instinct - the new one? Cuz thought that was uh, the guys that did the Borderlands 2 port, um, I guess same issue. Twin Galaxies or not, Iron Galaxy is the leaderboard, yeah, they didn't do Iron Galaxy, that's right, IR, yeah. So but Rare did Viva Pi\u00f1ata on last gen. Pi\u00f1ata is a game a select group of people really love and talk about, I mean Christine loves that game, you know? Yeah, right, loves making caterpillars make out. Yeah, everybody loves it, but like, and that that would be an easier one to come back to but I",

Obviously, it doesn't have to be Rare; the IP is more valuable than the Rare name at this point right? Like, they're kids who grew up with no idea R is... they kind of know that they... this is all about them wanting to bring back the franchises and finding the right fits to make those games. So I think that could be cool, like for me specifically Battletoads - just the idea of playing a Battletoads now excites me; I just like them as characters, I like that world; it's very Ninja Turtles but it's not Ninja Turtles yeah cool sign me up yeah unlockable in the game would be the original game of course that'd be awesome yeah great I I wonder I really wonder the resonance that a lot of these I think as we get older I think especially Greg and I like we're",

It wasn't it was good but it wasn't like the originals were way better, you know, and that was that was like a frame-for-frame remake of the original wasn't even like a new game so it was a new game in its own way but it was the same, you know, same kind of thing. And uh, you know, so to me I I wonder like how far back can you really conceivably go? You were talking about Wizards & Warriors that would be funny but like that doesn't mean anything to anyone, The Battletoads doesn't mean anything to anyone, Contra Force doesn't mean anything to anyone, uh, you know. You have to maybe go back to Donkey Kong Country but obviously Donkey Kong's really retro now, you you have to so it's like can you go back to Jet Force Gemini?
