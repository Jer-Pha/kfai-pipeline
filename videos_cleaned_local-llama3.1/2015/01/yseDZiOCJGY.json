Hi, I'm getting the dog to drink water so Colin doesn't kill him. That's why I have two waters. One's for me and one's for Portillo. He won't drink water. Portillo has no survival instincts. It's like, he is the living embodiment of Darwinism, of survival. He doesn't know to drink water. He'll come to bed all night long. It's like you're thirsty and then if he doesn't drink or eat, you gotta praise him to eat. If he doesn't either, he has a seizure. It's like, gah! So different than us. Yeah, thank God he's here with us. Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first episode of this show. Now, if you're familiar with us for any reason as video game dudes or as us from the Game Over Greggy show, this is combining those two worlds. Which is pretty exciting.

You can get it on iTunes, SoundCloud, all those places for free. A week later, if you want it early, you can go to patreon.com slash Kinda Funny Games. That'll be a rigmarole. You should know it well by now. I introduced the word rigmarole to your life, right? And I loved it. Okay, just making it happen. It's a great word. It's just funny how it's now a thing every podcast, every video. It's a really, really good thing. If you just want to buy the newest episode, you can go to Bandcamp, Kinda Funny Games dot com.

But every week we talk about all the video game stuff, all the news that's happening, whatever we want to talk about. It's liberating. This is the big topic picture. This is the big picture podcast. Colin and I of course are over on twitch.tv slash Kinda Funny Games doing a daily talk show about comics, games, movies, everything. The biggest stories. Here's where we can come in and get nitty gritty with giant topics and wrestle around with our role room, take our shirts off. Oh, yeah. Oh, damn.

And I'm sure the comments on YouTube and of course over on Patreon are exploding. I love your NPR voice. This is my NPR voice?

This is now our job. That's an eye-opening thing for me. But 2014 brought us a lot of good games. Oh yeah. What's our game of the year for 2014? Greg? South Park: The Stick of Truth is game of the year. That's a good choice. And I've gone, I've gone around, I've had a rigmarole about what game I would pick as my game. No, I don't think you're using that word right there. No. You can't just put it wherever you want. Well. It was roll into the rig. Yesterday I went to my sandwich shop and had a rigamarole. Oh.

How did, and like, I hadn't had that experience with other games that year, and granted it was an early game, and then the rest of the year still. Like, there's great games that I want to give shout outs to. A lot of shout outs coming my way. Oh yeah. But my pick for Game of the Year is South Park. Okay. Colin? My pick would be Shovel Knight, and I'm wearing my Shovel Knight shirt right now. It's funny because all the great, that one's all themself. I made you sound the gun.

But in terms of pure gameplay, gameplay is king as I always say. I made up that term. You hear that term anywhere else, it's because I made it up. You coined it. Yeah. I coined \"bro shooter,\" and I coined \"bro shooter.\" You're gonna take credit for \"bro shooter.\" Yeah, I'm definitely taking credit for \"bro shooter.\" And I'm taking credit, certainly.

Or it could be a 16-bit side scroller, or a XIII-bit, whatever. Side scroll is all you need. Exactly. This game just plays like a dream. It's part Capcom's DuckTales, it's part Zelda II, it's part Mario III, it's part Mega Man II, it's part Ninja Gaiden, it's part Castlevania, there's a lot of great, and the weird thing about that is that those aren't just throwaway games. Those are all fantastic games. If you were to make a list of the top 20 NES games, every one of those games would be on that list. You know? All three Ninja Gaiden, all six Mega Mans, all three Castlevania's. Sure. You know, Zelda II, DuckTales, they're all, so they didn't",

You know, Zelda 2, DuckTales, they're all... so they didn't just borrow a little bit from Metal Storm, we're gonna borrow a little bit from Faxanadu a little bit, but not just these regular games. So it was a really special game. And I think people were really surprised by it. And it's not, my only complaint is it's not very hard, it's not a very hard game. And I want the games to be harder, but I do agree with you, South Park, fantastic. Right, you went into a lot of depth on why you liked it. I think for South Park it was effective. Sorry, I'm... No, it's great. We're figuring it out. This is how the Game Over Greggy show is this? Kinda Funny Gamescast Works. This table. We all talk about whatever we want.

No, that's the thing for South Park and why it stood out to me is that, super funny, I mean it's so hard to make a funny video game, right? Because like, comedy's all about timing. Exactly. I like that. And a pregnant pause. People stop because they're a P3 player, they're YouTubers. All about timing, so to put that into a game world is difficult to say the least. But South Park did it by, first off, having the game look like the show. And that's what's crazy. I remember a long time ago playing Simpsons Wrestling on the PS1 and being like, this looks just like the show! It's like, was I stupid? No it didn't, it was horrible. But looking at South Park, I showed my brother and he actually thought it was South Park. Right. Like until you see the commands come up. Yeah, once the HUD pops up, yeah.

It's like this entire season's long story and it is and I love that. I always think it gets a bad rap from people who are like, oh sure but I don't like South Park. It's like, or I'm not up to date on South Park. I'm like, I hadn't watched South Park in years and jumped into this game and had so much fun. And it wasn't about callbacks as much as it was about right now and them having a commentary on video games, on role playing, all these different things. And then for me, the turn off for me with RPGs a lot of times is how complicated they get and how much stuff is happening. People knock the combat system of South Park: The Stick of Truth. I liked it. No, I liked it too. Sure it was simple but I, it wasn't simple where I'm like just",

Sure it was simple but I, it wasn't simple where I'm like just button mashing and not paying attention. It was Costume Quest simple. Yeah. Where there's a sense of timing in what I'm doing and that mattered and I enjoyed it. Yeah, it's similar to the Mario & Luigi RPG games. Right. And that's awesome. Like they're fun, it's a little more actiony than the whole like just grindy stuff like ActRaiser. Yeah. They're really really good. Going back to Shovel Knight real quick, how do you think that compares to the NES games? Like would you put that in the same caliber as them though? No, I mean, yeah I would and I wouldn't. I mean I think that those games are products of their time so like when I judge a game like Super Mario Bros. 3 or something it's so impressive. Today I still think Super Mario Bros. 3 is a 10 actually. You know, that was made in 1987 and 88, released in 88 obviously",

You know, that was made in 1987 and 88, released in 88 obviously in Japan, 90 here and that game is a product of the limitations of that time. In other words, my assumption is that if Shovel Knight was put on an NES cartridge it wouldn't work because there's certainly things it's doing that it shouldn't be doing. But, you know, nonetheless like I think that it's more apt to compare it to Mega Man 9 or Mega Man 10 or Blood Rain Betrayal or like one of these really old school side-scrollers that are made today. And I think that it's just a fantastic game, it understands what it is and I think that that's really cool. It's new and unique and you can see a lot of different games and especially for people that grew up with NES like we did, like it is one of those special games but I know for a fact on Twitter and you know on IGN people have mentioned to us, you",

They have no frame of reference really and it's still a great game to them too and that's how I know when I hear things like that that this game is really special. In terms of South Park, if it wasn't for Child of Light I think South Park would certainly be my game of the year because I agree with you, I haven't watched South Park regularly since 2000 maybe? Yeah. 2001 so, and I've seen maybe a handful of episodes at all since then. And they're amazing, always. And it is a great show and I never had a problem with it, it's like I authentically don't like The Simpsons for instance, like I actually don't like that show. Sorry Kevin, but South Park was just one of those things where I'm like oh I'm not into it anymore, it's fine, it's funny, they're very",

It's not your thing. It made me laugh out loud, it made me laugh from my stomach like that. I don't think a game has ever made me laugh more than a couple times ever. And the fact that this game was funny and it engaged my girlfriend in the sense that she was watching and she was doing her Cartman impression and stuff like that that I didn't even know she could do which was like hilarious. And it was a well-told story and I think the combat is actually really good too. I think the one problem with the game was the way it ran and that, you know, it's easy to overlook, it's like what we talk about with Bethesda games, it's easy to overlook some of the technical flaws of a game when they're so good.

And I think that that was the thing with South Park: The Stick of Truth was that you had hiccuped for a few people, some people had like save corruption I think and like freezing game stuff. I never had any problems with that. For mine it would be like there'd be a glitch, like a frame stop and then it would speed up and catch up to where I was. It was always like entering a new area and walking, it wasn't like I broke the game. But I loved it and I'll tell you guys this, two things about this game. One is that I hope that they do another one and I think Obsidian's capable of doing another one. I think that money was made on this game, I think it surprised a lot of people, it certainly charted an MPD. Extra costs were involved with developing for such a long time, obviously it was in a series, in limbo, yeah in development hell literally",

The problem with, I think, I don't think they'd run it. I know. Doing a sequel though the problem with right is the fact that it was Matt and Trey that like, I mean they, the reason it's so funny is that they were so hands on with it. I remember doing the Comic Con panel with them where they're making jokes about never wanting to do it again but there is a lot of, it was ringing true too because you know they're used to writing their script and getting it out and everybody knows how crazy their process is to make an episode of South Park.

I mean I think that their involvement was essential obviously just like it is for the show's longevity. I think the other interesting thing that we have to consider is that this game was supposed to come out at a certain time. Obviously THQ went down but even when it was reacquired by another publisher it was supposed to come out earlier. This is a great example of a game needing more time and getting more time and it working out. We often talk about that when we did Podcast Beyond on The Last of Us which was a great example.

They got even more time over at Obsidian and Obsidian is doing a lot of other stuff right now so I'm sure that they were stressed out with that but they did a really nice job. That was my biggest surprise of the year was that game. I just didn't expect to like it like that. And up and down, left and right I wanted that game to be three times longer, I wanted it to be bulkier and bigger but it was perfect kind of the way it was. Yeah exactly, it left me wanting more right? I didn't burn out, I don't look back at it and I think like you know how so many games end with such a bullshit boss battle.

It's like there were so many things in that game where in the beginning you start and you're like I can't wait to see Mr. Hankey and I had forgotten all about him until you run into him. It's like oh my god. My childhood. Yeah exactly. That's awesome. There's so many chances for that game to have failed so miserably. Yeah. Oh yeah. Come on. Yeah exactly. And didn't either way, that was the really surprising thing. I guess I underestimated South Park's poll still. Much like I underestimated Simpsons' poll still. It's like why is this show still on?

Because it reminded me a lot of the way people felt about Wolfenstein which was, I think people were unimpressed in preview coverage or just didn't really know what the game was. And that happened with Wolfenstein too and then they ended up actually being way better than people thought. So it's actually kind of pleasant. That usually doesn't happen like that. You usually get a pretty good idea of if the game is going to be worth your time or not pretty early based on playing. Well the thing about South Park is that they hit it for so long. Nobody saw that game for so long and then finally we all got to, not all of us but you know I went with a bunch of other games journalists and got to play it at Ubisoft.

Am I allowed to be excited for this? I remember asking people. Yeah that game was really surprising. Yeah well you guys are wrong because the game of the year is obviously Super Smash Bros. That's a great choice. Like we all knew I was going to say that but my god. It's so good. Whether it's on the 3DS or Wii U. Now granted the Wii U is way better. Way better.

But when I went and played it on the 3DS XL I was like alright this is awesome. This is better. It's still not perfect but just the fact that I get to play Smash whenever I want. And like originally when they first announced that the 3DS one was coming out before the Wii U I was like ok Nintendo you're just throwing it in like you're giving up on the Wii U and this is the design of that whatever. And now I'm like nah they just wanted to give the demo for people to like tell them you need the better version of this right. And like I feel like did that work to sell Wii U's? I don't know.

So they'd want to like you know try to get people to get the Wii U one first. But the 3DS one I'm happy at the end of the day that it came out first. Because that gave me a month and a half of like practice. No just like a different experience really. Like there's so much different stuff with that game like single player mode specifically that I loved. Did you like the whole stupid run through the area and beat it? I hated it. That's right. Garbage. Thank you. Total garbage. But like there was a lot of other stuff in it that I did like. But the Wii U one brings back the event mode and like all the stuff",

You can watch it right here on youtube.com slash kinda funny games. Yeah it is an unrivaled party game and that series really always has been. Because I mean even on N64 just by the nature of N64 is four ports and stuff it's the same reason why Goldeneye worked and stuff like that. Like you could involve more people and get people involved in in in you know two player matches whatever you wanted to do. But it just was an engaging kind of game even when that came out.

But as a gamer myself as a single player gamer I'm never going to sit there and play it. That's why I kind of like Subspace Emissary on Super Smash Bros. Melee which was also on Super Smash Bros. Brawl because at least it gave me something to kind of do as you know you're always collecting trophies and it's always like kind of a single player component. But I felt like that was cohesive and it was fun and you wanted to see the kind of the next stupid cutscene about the cutscenes made it worth it like that mode was really bad really when you think about it. But like it was still fun and it was worth it just to get the cutscenes and but Super Smash Bros. Melee had the Adventure Mode which was that minus the cutscenes. Right.

Yeah and that's I think that's a problem because I think that you know there's a few things that are clear with this game it's it's it's gonna be a huge hit for Nintendo and stuff like that but it's not gonna push it an astronomical amount of Wii U so this is gonna be a game that is out there for a limited number of people and they're gonna therefore have you know either their friends over or they can play online and it does work online we've played it online.

I think that's the same way when we talk about Gran Turismo and those kinds of things, like where in the future these are gonna become platforms.

Yeah. Now I don't think they'll add a single player mode to it. They won't. And I do think that this is Nintendo playing to what their console is their console is a machine that gets turned on at irregular intervals to be played for whatever the big thing is right so the fact that you already have a machine that is it's just a toy like this is what you do you don't play it every day you play it when you want to play",

Well, Fire Emblem is a big deal, I have no problem with Fire Emblem characters being in it, but it's like these guys, I don't even know the difference between these guys, like aesthetically or by skill set. There was a couple choices on the roster that just make no sense, like Lucina and Marth being literally the same, and Dr. Mario coming back, it's like what, why would you even waste that?

Yeah Simon Belmont's a great choice Mega Man getting in there was awesome but I've always said that Dr. Wily as a Pok\u00e9mon trainer like character would have been awesome and I was hoping someone would steal that idea they're much more people than me and Nintendo that maybe have come up with that independently and like just it's so brilliant he stands in the background uses robots there's a lot of different characters they can they can draw from from their history to make it a more interesting roster that said this was a good example and a good reminder to us because we like PlayStation All-Stars about why this game works and All-Stars",

We've talked about this in some ways we've talked about this many times like what's one way well I think that the meter building is really interesting because it's really all about it's not about chip damage it's really about meter building in which you can unleash these things that might not hit and so you have to build it to level three where you can use it to scatter when we talked about this many times before I want to bore people with it they probably heard it before but Smash Brothers is a unique game that All-Stars probably should have.",

That's that. I haven't played that game in a long time either; I don't care about that game anymore. But again, the roster of All-Stars and the roster of Super Smash Brothers is a good example why Super Smash Brothers just works because man these characters are timeless.

You aren't getting ahead, you're just getting hit a million times, you're not getting items to get you in front of anybody, and you're getting hit all the time by red shells and crap. And so like it's like we're at Smash, and this goes back to what you're talking about. I think about how PlayStation All-Stars might have been a more pure fighter, and maybe one of the reasons that more people backed off Smash is still anybody's game even when we play all we play right Final Destination no items, it's still anybody's game.

Whereas the PlayStation slash Xbox depending on your sway right is it's movies it's TV it's music it's this narrative game it's this toy box game it's you know what I mean like it's hand over fist different experiences whereas Nintendo devices are Nintendo games which I feel are oh cool what's the story of",

And that was mainly local that was the one that the best thing about Freedom Wars was playing with Christine at the same time we went to Missouri and so what we would do because we're on vacation is wake up go to a nice breakfast or lunch or whatever then go to a coffee shop and spend three hours at the coffee shop playing Freedom Wars local I'm ad hoc.

Right, the fact that you're fighting giant monsters that are made of...in the city and all this stuff - where like Monster Hunter again getting too high fantasy for me with your god damn dragons I don't know what I'm going to do with it.

Well that was what was so great about Valiant Hearts is getting out introducing all these characters separating them on different sides of the you know the conflict or whatever and making you care about all of them and having that great narration you know I mean like it was funny like I remember when the E3 trailer dropped right getting teared up watching it and then not even the first time putting it all together that it was the dog talking you know",

But he is responsible for other games too that I don't think people give him credit for. Ani Mash, Dead Rising. I love Ani Mash. And he has just incredible chops. So it's like Mighty No. 9, and I played it, it's a continuation of Mega Man that's different. I think people are gonna be surprised by how different it is. You were surprised. And I was surprised by it too, but it's because it's got a different rhythm to it. It's got a different beat to it.

And I remember people watching me play Mega Man and they're like well why aren't you being a little more finesse with Mega Man 9 and 10. I'm like that's not how you play the game. I'm gonna figure out how to do this and I'm gonna get better and better and better until I can do it with my eyes closed and then I beat Mega Man 10 in like 24 minutes. So it's like you know that's the way you get there. With Mega Man or with Mighty No. 9 the game's about points and about kind of like skill and finesse and that was what surprised me about it.

And that's why I'm most excited about it. I actually got more excited about it when I played for it because I was like leave the classic stuff to Keiji Inafune and Capcom they're gonna make another Mega Man game I'm sure they're gonna make another one at some point Mega Man 11 or X9 or whatever and they'll do great. Keiji Inafune did a great job with Mighty No. 9 and I'm really hoping that that happens soon.

I don't think it'll be on 3DS and Wii U maybe. Those are the only ones I think it won't be on. It's on PC, Xbox 360, N1, PS3, and PS4 Vita so you'll be able to play it almost anywhere. But I'm so excited about that game and I think we're gonna see if he still has it and I think he does Soul Sacrifice is another example.

I fought long and hard on this, and I go back and forth between one game and two games. One game or two games. A or B. One or two. So I'm going backwards. Is it Batman: Arkham Knight or the letter that comes before Z? Nobody knows. I'm gonna say Batman: Arkham Knight. I think Y is the letter that comes before Z. Damn.

But even that, like, that it's one of those things all the games that come out right away even like now I think at least I'd like to believe when we're playing them as adults like we can still see that this is still your first swing. Your first you know at bat kind of thing right. Infamous: Second Son. Great game.

Seems to me that it's basically horde mode and I mean this is my interpretation of why I got excited about it that it's horde mode in a forest and you have like X amount of time to build reinforcements and then it gets nighttime or whatever and then everyone attacks you. I mean that's that seemed. And it's cool. It's like using forest stuff. Yeah that's fine. Using actual forest stuff. Yeah you know video games get all crazy and it's just like oh horde mode and you got a robot tree. Yeah no it's like no it's trees. I like that. It's really fun. Gotta go Nintendo here, Zelda.

The Yoshi games I love them so much because they're different than the Mario platformers and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island is one of my favorite games of all time. I think the level design of that is just impeccable. And Yoshi's Island on the DS wasn't so good. Yoshi's Island on the 3DS really wasn't so good. But this one, I'm holding out my thoughts on. I want it to be good. I want it to be amazing. And Nintendo's been doing really good lately. Captain Toad was awesome. Super fantastic. Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. What else do we got?

But Battlefront was again when she was working on Uncharted 4 so I assume she wants to write her own game. This perfectly leads us. What are our predictions for 2015 for video games? One of my predictions was that I wrote it down here, Zelda is delayed. I don't think that game comes out this year.

I mean the fact that we saw gameplay on a TV in the background, Classic Nintendo. But that says a lot. Yeah, I agree. So I think that that game's delayed and there's nothing wrong with that.

Nintendo would never do that. Yeah, never. They'd never do that to us again. Second prediction: Insomniac stays in bed with Microsoft and they announce Sunset Overdrive 2 at some point this year. Now here's a few interesting wrinkles about this. Number one, Insomniac's told...

They are making a PlayStation exclusive right now. The Ratchet and Clank reboot for PS4. Yeah that doesn't make any sense. The movie obviously is coming out I think just here too. They have like their little you know smaller games initiative with what was that game Outernauts or something like that? Yeah that like came and went without a game or. Yeah and they're trying different things or whatever.

But I think that the game did well enough critically and probably commercially it did pretty respectively especially because it was the bundle and stuff like that. Yeah the bundle definitely helped. That I think Microsoft and I think Microsoft understands they're sticking it directly to Sony by continuing to make Insomniac games that they go like watch you know they probably maybe the deal's already done maybe they're gonna do it early in the year and be like alright second one come out 2017 same engine Marcus and Drew can do the game again or whatever.

So I think I wouldn't be surprised if Insomniac and Microsoft made another game together. That game's going to be exclusive to Xbox One. It's gonna be Sunset Overdrive 2 and it will be announced this year and it will come out in 2017. That's my prediction. You're right there was a lot of holes. That's how it gets to you. And then I'll win. Just since this is the prediction episode we're putting predictions in the title I'm reiterating my one from last time around.

I keep saying maybe Wonder Woman. My vision for the future isn't that clear, but for sure Superman pops up in this game and gets shot down, of course, and he's mean to him and leaves him alone. Batman is mean to Superman because that's what Batman does. That's what he does. And that sets up a Justice League whatever game you want to call it.

Now to go to Arkham City and they found way more Easter eggs to put in don't get me wrong but still it was like it seems like you should have kept something in the tank a little bit more right now they're already doing a third one, now they get to get out of Gotham and have Smallville and have Metropolis and do these different things.

You know what I mean? Like it's a different world now where you can have an awesome Justice League narrative and have them all play off each other that way. So when would you see that game coming out? That's the problem - it's not going to be, I don't think, overt.

You need to follow through on it - it's the same thing we've talked about with Mass Effect 3.

What you have to remember is that next time BioWare releases a game, you don't buy it, you know? And then you send them that message.

I'm sick of hearing excuses of why it's impossible to test the game in this environment. Really, I don't think so. There have been hundreds of shooters released that have worked fine on a lot - there's nothing different about the infrastructure of these consoles and games like Destiny came out that were slammed by people, that worked way better than a game like DriveClub which was purchased by maybe a few hundred thousand people.
