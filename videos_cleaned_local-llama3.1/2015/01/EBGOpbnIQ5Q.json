I just love that world and I love that universe. I still tell my prediction still stands that it's going to have Superman and one woman in it to set up the Justice League game from them later on or whoever else does it - that'd be awesome. Yeah, but that's the game that stands out right now that I want so much more of because I you know each one of those games is like a giant extended animated series, right?

Yeah, that's what gets me excited about it. It's interesting to me that you mentioned Origins so I didn't play yeah but they implicitly don't acknowledge that game at E3, so like I'm just saying like I thought I'm just throwing it out there that I found that interesting at PSX they were like this is the conclusion of the Batman Trilogy right and I was like wow like like you are going to straight up just ignore that game.

So again with Phantom Pain, I always get excited when Kojima does something. I was excited when three was announced; I was excited when four was announced, you know? But I'm just like, \"again, it's a wait and see kind of thing\" where I'm like, \"I want to see what this game is,\" and I think that he's had enough time to marinate on it. It's been a long time, you know - Peace Walker was obviously released in between four and five, but it's been a long time since he's really had a chance to figure things out again.

And I totally get that - it's just here's a bunch more story to kind of tie everything together for the people that want that, which I did, even if it doesn't make any sense exactly. Um, even though I liked the the gameplay, just the it was action-focused and that was fun for me, like I liked that a lot. Whereas Three, Three is an amazing game - doesn't click with me; it's just not my thing. The story is so good, but there's a little too much focus on um the actual stealth and all camo stuff, and yeah, that was the thing that immediately I always tell the story about it when I started playing Three, I was like really excited, and uh, because I really did love Two, and uh, I especially loved Big Shell and to I know it's like you know so like I",

It's just the fact of the matter is I just want more Hitman and like I just want to spend another week with that game. And that's a thing people get lost in when they see like, \"Oh, it's too violent.\" It's too this, and it's... it's not even it is violent right in a very cartoony way.
