People seem to ignore that Gabe Logan died at the end of Logan's Shadow (spoilers) you son of a ****, Garin literally killed off the main character so he wouldn't have to make any more Syphon Filter. Yeah hold on though I mean in defense as someone who reviewed this game and loved and played it back to front maybe I think I reviewed this one or me or Jeff but we both played it back to back like like it's not it's not like a definitive everyone standing over his grave yeah g it's like Gabe they walk out of the bar they're like like their training unit or whatever and Gabe shot and then Leanne is over him screaming Gabe and then it it like f the black she like Gabe Gabe like you know like oh how definitive he's dead no cuz that's that's that would seem",

It says plus, despite despite all the praise they didn't sell very low sales all around. Yeah, I mean that makes sense sadly sad but true. The PS1 one did fine, but um um yeah, but then that yeah I mean they kept you know kept turning them around pretty quickly after that. I remember I had a demo of one of the PS1 games that came on a Pizza Hut demo disc and I played that thing so much. And then there was a demo of the third game I think it was second or third game, and it all it was was the opening part where you jump out of the plane with a parachute and it was in you land on the snowy mountain and you just go through that. I played that like a hundred times. I'll never know what the rest of that game looks like. Demo discs are awesome, miss those days something",

And why isn't an Infamous on V? It doesn't make any sense, and especially with Cole and The Last of Us - that was our big plan, that was our big scheme of why this is happening. They're still pushing him, and especially with Second Son, where Cole is literally nowhere to be found in that game, which was like really surprising to me because I was like he's got to be there, I waited until the end of that game, like he is definitely not in this game, you know I was like",

Sucker Punch kind of controls that, and if they're going to make an Infamous game right around the time when Second Son comes out, that's probably not a good look. That makes sense. Um, this goes back to the fan thing we're talking about franchise fatigue, right? Of like, yeah, get another Golden Abyss or whatever out, and then it's like well no we have Uncharted 4 coming, it needs to be a big deal there has to be a gap there. Well okay we'll get another... we'll get an Infamous out, well no we're launching Second Son there needs to be a gap there.

So do you think that with the V game specifically, the franchise fatigue can also hit when it's a console game versus a handheld game even if they're different games? Yeah I think so. I mean I I mean I would take it a step further than Greg - nothing is immune to franchise fatigue, nothing. And and it's not only franchise, it's types like we talk about with V with superhero movies and superhero TV shows and all this nothing is is immune to to to saturation like hitting a wall.",

Because that is our marquee title, that's our Halo basically. And so you have to be smart with it, and I respect that. I mean, I think they know they could put an Uncharted out on Vita, another Uncharted sell a bunch of Vitas and a bunch of copies of the game, but they don't see that it's worth it because it might affect Uncharted for's bottom line - a game that could sell 10 million copies.

It doesn't matter how much I back it up and how much I really believe that. It's like there; it's impossible. A Saw 4 was a 10, and it's like this is so much better than four. You know what I mean? But like, that's the problem: putting something on a handheld, you're already bringing down the quality of the graphics, this, that, and the other. And people are already going to sit there and go, \"Well, it's nowhere near as good as we always talk about with Golden Abyss.\" Right, that game has sold incredibly well, but it's still not talked about on that level when in fact it's better than Drake's Fortune.

I just think that when you think about Infamous, and I love Infamous \u2013 you know, I'm a huge fan; evidence by the wall in the living room, it's all Infamous crap.
