There's a lot of games coming out; we're in the beginning of the year, which means we've got a lot to look forward to in 2015. Sure, earlier we were talking about Game of Thrones episode two - I'm excited for that in the coming weeks, yeah. But obviously as people who have full-time jobs, even though we didn't expect things to be so full-time, yeah, we haven't had that much time to play video games besides the streaming and the Let's Plays and all that. But we haven't had time to sit and just play through games and experience them the way we want to. Right? And a lot of times, there's a big difference between playing a game and experiencing it - a lot of people like you're so bad at Smash Bros, it's like, 'Hey, first off, I'm not claiming to be good at Smash Bros,' but second off, put that on it's harder to play.\"",

You're so bad at Smash Bros., it's like, \"Hey, first off, I'm not claiming to be good at Smash Bros.\" But second off, put that on its harder to play games while talking to a camera, while talking to people, and like trying to create something that's entertaining. Creating entertainment and playing a game are two different things, sure. And uh, there is you know some common denominators between them. But besides that, it's like, it's sometimes I just want to play a game specifically single-player games. I just want to sit there and I just want to play it. I want to make my mistakes and I don't want couple people judging me in the comments or telling me what to do and all that stuff and half of them are wrong and all this **** but sometimes I do want that and so I I go for that. So I haven't had the time to sit and play a bunch of games yeah that I wanted to play. What what are you guys, I mean trying to make time for the best part about launching this",

It's just funny when I look at my trophies; people say like what could our trophies be if you don't care about them? At the very least, it chronicles what you've done, which is pretty cool. And when I look at my trophies going all the way back to when they launched in 2008, man I played a ton of games until this past year just I played like everything and it wasn't just like dabbling it was like I was beating the out of these games mhm um but that was during the time when like Cheryl was away right yeah that's a big part of it right like that's what and this isn't us lamenting having loved ones or but it's you know like we work all day doing this right and now like when I like we're going to leave and I",

Um, the Bioshock games, I need to play. Oh wow, really? Yeah, that's one that I'm like, \"Wow.\" But I have this problem where I love old games so much that I've just constantly wanted to go back and just play them because I love those experiences.

Yeah, and I was like, all right, you know what, I'm just not gonna do it. And then they released the HD collection of Prince of Persia, so I did that instead. Yeah, and then I just never got to Assassin's Creed 2. I've replayed... I've played the first hour of Assassin's Creed 2 multiple times, but that's enough. Yeah, you've seen enough.
