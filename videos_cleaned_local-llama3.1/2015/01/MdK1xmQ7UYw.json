I just feel like he's kind of putting himself out there and doing his thing, and I don't really see that he's mean-spirited; he's never done anything as far as I know to anyone. I don't really get it. He has a bit of an antiquated look, for sure, which is why I think when you look at him, it looks like a guy who had a girlfriend in the late 90s and was like, \"You should dress like this,\" and then she broke up with him, and then no one ever told him to stop dressing like that, so he got stuck in that time period.
