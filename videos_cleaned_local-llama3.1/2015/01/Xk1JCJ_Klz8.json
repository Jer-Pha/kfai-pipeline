The whole game is about why Superman can't see five things in front of him exactly, what kind of fog is so many ways to tie this into our last topic - the trailer for Man of Steel is on my top five trailer list of all time; it's so good. Which one gives people an ideal to strive towards? So you're going with the Jor-El trailer, not Jor, I didn't care too much about Jon that character was not solid, just not Jonathan K. No, the Jor-El character was amazing though. Russell Crowe is by far the best part of that movie; the first like 30 minutes is the best part. The soundtrack, yeah, the soundtrack is amazing too. Yeah, Russell Crowe is really cool until he's on the ship and he's doing like this, like he no, that's no you ruin that exactly what the hell is that? It's Jor-El, the apparition of Jor-El on the ship acting like an idiot. The problem with putting Lois around does nobody remember this movie I don't.",

It's more about the people around him and the circumstances around him that teach like what he does teaches them if that makes sense right? That does make sense yeah she's saying he's not learning as much as he he does yeah he doesn't have as much of a character arc like even if you watch the cartoons or things like that it's generally which I love even if you watch the cartoons well, Master storytelling cartoons well they are I mean to a certain degree like they're they're better than the actual movies if you watch those you're talking about Superman yeah th% yes I agree with you yeah.

Cuz that's where it all went off track - like this guy is so powerful that he can rewind time, and so many people believe that. And so it doesn't matter that the cartoon resets in a way that he's like... I remember them being very vocal, Bruce Tim, and everybody when they brought the cartoon out, saying our Superman can be hurt by conventional weapons - granted, it has to be like a tank or whatever - but he's not able to just fly straight through and not feel a thing. Right? This is happening to him. And then same thing with Smallville, right where... Smallville is the best action interpretation of Superman ever, period, in my lifetime, anyone's lifetime.

Because like wow, 10 years of Smallville is the best. There's a lot of crap in Smallville, don't get me wrong, there's a lot of bad, but the good is so good, you know what I mean? Like if they could boil that down to a movie it'd be so perfect, yeah. But I mean taking a step back with that, the reason why Smallville was so good was because he was discovering all those powers with him right? Sure, he didn't...I've never seen the part in Smallville where he flies, but apparently that does happen right?

That's why Batman Begins is so great; that's why The Dark Knight wasn't so much at no point in The Dark Knight, other than that cool moment where he used the things that he learned to beat, like his bionic knee that can kick through walls or whatever the hell I think was The Dark Knight Rises. I thought he said I apologize, no, sorry. Um, yeah, so mad about The Dark Knight Rises; it was even worse right, like The Dark Knight Rises should have been about him coming back and figuring out how to beat Bane. Yeah, and then we have this all-important note where he goes up against Bane in the First Act or maybe it's the Second Act, I don't remember timing-wise.",

And then we have this all-important note where he in the First Act or maybe it's the second act - I can't remember timing-wise - he goes up against Bane and just goes, \"I'll fight harder.\" Right? Every single time. Fight harder. That is not Batman; Batman can't just fight his way through this thing. He had to figure out, in the comic books, how does he beat Bane? It's not by taking out the Venom right. So we have that one kind of homage to that where he likes punches him - that was possibly your worst \"B\" of all, no brother. He says, \"Got to get to the 1920s.\" Maring do I... and so I think that I think that in order to make a good Superman movie, you have to have either you have to have a villain that can beat him on some level right. And that villain's always been Lex Luthor right; Lex Luthor has been the sort of brain version of Superman's braa. Right?

But but I'm hoping that they have to team up to beat Lex Luthor in a way that is compelling. You know this will just be like when they cross over the first time in the Animated Series because that's the same thing happens: they go toe-to-toe for a while and then they have to go and fight the Joker. And comic book movies stuff, that's a great moment by the way. Yeah, this is talking about you're talking about Superman and Batman, yeah, yeah.

Not alone, I mean from a larger scale, right? It's this immigrant story, this guy who comes here and bootstraps his way through whatever.

You know what I mean? That's so second to his person that he is a normal person that has these extraordinary abilities, and he has to learn how to deal with it.

I like it that he is, and again, I keep going back to Smallville because that was such a great version of this - this is who he is, he's this ideal, he's striving, he's learning. Goes back to what you're saying right, that he's learned these lessons, that's compelling. But in the same breath, I mean like you can tell an origin story that boils that down and then means something going forward. And the fact of like I read the Smallville digital comics right, and for me, like he's Superman there; he's still learning and doing all these different things but like it's the backstory of the 10 years with that character",

Yeah, um, I think that's what they tried to do with Man of Steel right, they tried to sort of show us him, they tried to cram all of Smallville into that first like 45-minute hour, you know, of the movie. 45 minutes well yeah, cuz we kept getting flashbacks as he was going and we were like seeing what he was learning as it was a lot of flashbacking in that movie 100%.

You know what I mean? I'm not asking for them to clock him with a gun or whatever or show, but if you one statement, if you show him struggle with an SUV or something, you're like, \"Oh, I get it.\" And like when you were saying it's a throwback to when he was too powerful in the beginning, in the beginning, the comics couldn't just have him jump over buildings right and Hyperion's needles bounced off his skin.

I hope. My thing is this: it's going to be really hard from a shooting standpoint to figure out you've got two heroes, you have to have two sort of rising lines of action right?
