I swear to God. So back at IGN, I would be on the daily; I'd like to help produce The Daily Fix, let him host and yes, L him host, and I swear that was our story - like the amount of times I was like, \"Hey, uh, can we make a thumbnail that says GTA heists are coming?\" Yeah, yeah, maybe like twice a month, right? And it's just like they're finally actually coming. There's details we're getting; they said there's a couple of them coming at launch and there's different types of heist coming at launch - is what you just said - and it's at well that's what they're saying, like they're just coming as GTA Online launches and when I read that I was like wait a second that's a weird word to use but yeah so my question to you guys is is this okay is this a bad thing or is this a great thing that a game that's a year old is more",

My Cheetos impression is the monkey impression that Ed does in Shaun of the Dead. So that was a walk to get you. He does a really good one. He anyways, it's a good thing it gets people reined in. I'm not... I have GTA on PS4. I haven't touched it. I played the hell out of GTA PS3. This is the reason to put it in. This is the reason to do it. I have the weird thing about it is like we know people who are super into the GTA online community, like Fredo was super into it. And you, you talk more about Fredo than I do because I just get distracted by that body. I never heard people really bitching that Heists weren't there.

We're just doing this to tide ourselves over for this and then just reached the point where they're like, \"Okay, I guess yeah exactly.\" And then they moved off. I don't think Alfredo's played GTA since then. Do you think he'll come back for this? I'm sure he will; yeah, yeah, I guarantee he'll get in there and he'll have his go-to Twitch channel, twitch.tv/AlfredoPlays, watch him do it. And uh, they'll definitely be doing that stuff.

I played it and a few other games; I'm like, \"I just really don't want to play this game.\" And uh, it wasn't about you know, I just like, \"I don't want to do this,\" you know? And that was weird. I've beaten Grand Theft Auto III, I guess three, Vice City, San Andreas, and four, and then The Lost and Damned. I loved all of that stuff, and so, the stories in those games on PSP, I loved those games. And so it was like, it was weird that it didn't resonate with me.

It's like it's not like Heist; it's like here it is, exactly. I think a big difference with Heist is that in GTA, like every a lot of people really, really, really liked that game, but their favorite parts are the heists. Right? Like I feel like everyone's favorite part of that game was the heist, and so the fact that we're just getting more of people's favorite part of the game is huge. And I feel like that's why they also can kind of just draw it out a little bit just because it's like, \"Hey, you're just getting more of your favorite thing of this game.\" And I guess with Destiny, like the raids are like everyone's favorite part too, so I'm not high level yet.",

So like there are thriving online communities on shooters that sell half a million units, you know? Like so it's not like... and many more people are going to download Heists, um, and I think they know that. And then there's microtransactions all sorts of stuff you can spend money on, you know. I'm sure Rockstar is a very shrewd company, you know. And uh, that's what I'm saying like this is just a perfect storm for them. This is not something anyone else can get away with and I'm not sure they can even get away with it in another game, you know? Like I don't even...",

Yeah, Red Dead Redemption had online, people forget that all the time - there was online and you'd ride around and fight things and you know hang out with your friends, but it wasn't... if they put a giant patch out for Red Dead nobody would care. But the major difference too is because you guys were talking about Titanfall and how that game resonated with people quickly but then was forgotten really - is because it's not only because it was only on one console, because I don't believe that that's the case, I mean that game sold well and it was also on 360, it was also on PC. It's that they should have had... EA had the maybe didn't have the luxury to hold the game",

It's that they should have had the luxury to hold the game longer, let them do something with it; it was an empty game for a lot of people, and Grand Theft Auto is not an empty game. So there's not like a bunch of people up in arms saying \"Where's the Grand Auto I wanted?\" Like, the Grand Theft Auto you wanted is the 50-hour storyline; this is like all ancillary stuff. So again, it's a perfect storm - it's the right situation for the right company with the right game and the right franchise at the right time. Exactly, and I think GTA is such the right franchise for that because Titanfall is a shooter at the end of the day; GTA is whatever the hell it is - it's a racing game, it's a shooting game, it's a drug simulator; exactly, it's all of these different things like the fact that they've still consistently been able to put out these",

Got you know um and he the thing is there's a huge audience of people that are just competitive in multiplayer that play like the pros so they use their settings and use their maps. Same thing's true with Smash Bros where it's like you know there's rules for competitive Smash Bros and like certain maps are legal, certain maps aren't. And even though we're not pros, we still kind of play by those rules just because it's like oh well that's the real game you know. And I feel like first-person shooters also have that make sense, that set of standards you know um so the platform idea is just interesting for for shooters specifically yeah someone will either have to figure it out or not. I think Racers makes sense you know like Gran Turismo exactly Mario Kart like I think Nintendo's doing great with their DLC with how they're doing the thing I hate that.\n\nI corrected phonetic mistakes and spelling errors, especially for names (Alfredo), pop culture references (Smash Bros, Gran Turismo, Mario Kart), and brands (Nintendo). I also capitalized proper nouns like game titles (Smash Bros) and company names (Nintendo).",

I don't think they will; they'll just do Mario Kart 9, yeah, yeah. Um, and Smash Bros. I'm super excited to see what they do with that because Smash Bros is like a weird thing where it's like it's not seen as a real fighting game; it's not like Street Fighter, you know? It's more of a party thing, yeah, I know that a lot of people in the fighting game community don't really take it seriously. Um, which is fine, I mean, yeah, it is what it is. I mean, you know what I mean; like they're it's played competitively for money, so there is something there right. And I certainly have a lot more fun with it than I do with the fighting regular fighting game. Although, you know what, the hell do I really know about that genre? Very little.

Like I have the Wii U for Mario Kart and for Smash Brothers and for Zelda, but like Mario Kart, I'm always going to want to hold on to because there'll be a day when I have a bunch of people over, let's play something. Oh wait, Mario Kart. Street Fighter is another thing that would be interesting because I mean that's that's a game that they really re-released, you know what I mean? Like it's just insane. I think that as a platform could make a little sense but then again there's the competitive angle too where it's like that would require patches and you almost have to pay a subscription service for first; that's how Call of Duty could work if it was a subscription thing, yeah, you have to constantly pay and that you",
