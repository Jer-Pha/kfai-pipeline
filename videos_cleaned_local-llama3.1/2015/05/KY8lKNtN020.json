You can see I can click around here, see where they all came in. They all come in and they're just... my personnel thing. But so yeah, 62 hours in, I clearly have done a lot in this game. There, the missions are over here. But what works so well about Peace Walker was the fact of all the other stuff you got to go do.

What I always talk about is the fact that I love the I we never you know when we do the top 25 lists at IGN right and me and Colin would make sure that Metal Gear Solid 4 did not get put on PS3s my reasoning right was always the fact that sh that's might actually get over there not yet; I love when you hit them in the back and with a dart and they're just like \"huh, interesting\"; uh no, that uh yeah Metal Gear Solid 4 is not a mission you're going to be able to jump right into.",

And this was something brilliant that was always overlooked, right? So yeah, this is our first introduction to the character I'm skipping it but you saw it earlier I was talking around we were just talking about it when we eventually get back to Mother Base here so we go to Mother Base gives me the rundown of everybody went to I could go in and I can briefly show you how to adjust everybody.

So there you go; they're working on a twin-barrel stun gun, I think a shotgun. I wasn't anyways.
