Sometimes you can call it, you can shoot, call it like right before you even fart, like this one I know I know based on just the feeling of how it's working through the pipeline that it's going to be a bad one. The gurgles and sometimes you know you save it if you're with your significant other and you know it's coming out, you're like, 'You know what, it's time for it.' There hasn't been one like this in a while, and you eat it out and just wait. You know I've often thought about that, like when you kind of get it in the reserves, you know, when you get that moment, you're like, 'Am I going to make it? Is it about to pop out or can I suck this in?' And then you reach that point of either it pops and you're done, because it's double or nothing.\"",

So I think you can go in a lot of different directions, but you know, I would go with what the games that are just the most fun. Yeah, um, cuz that's why we all started playing games - we didn't all start playing games because we thought they told good stories or like that they were pretty to look at.
