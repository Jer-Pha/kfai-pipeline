Yeah, I think the risk aversion obviously is shown in multiple industries because you're talking about getting your superhero movies for instance, and we're going to get those in droves until they run into the ground. It's the same way we get Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty and all these kinds of games for the most part in the trip space and gaming. Um, and what really surprised me about uh, Igarashi specifically in Coji Akihisa's approach to Igarashi's Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is that he went to something like two dozen publishers who all turned him down. Um, and it seems so... Is that because now let's back up for a second why would they turn him down.\"",

Um, and it's so... it seems so is that because now let's back up for a second why would they turn him down? Was it because the last Castlevania is just underperformed? Well, I mean his Castlevania did perform. I mean in our interview you guys can check out on YouTube.com of Kinda Funny Games we did a 90-minute interview with Koji Igarashi what he was saying was that the games were all profitable but maybe not profitable enough for a big company like Konami right and so he would go to publishers with his agent Ben Jaffe, and they would basically be told \"no one wants to invest in this game\" or \"we can't make money on this game.\" And to them I don't think necessarily making a profit is... is making money. To them they want to make as much from their capital investment as possible, and that's and that's natural for business to want to do but what's extraordinary to me is that these games are going to be made significantly cheaper.",

So that again, you have to take everything in a case-by-case basis. And I'm excited about Mighty No. 9. I am disappointed that Deep Silver is publishing it not because I don't think good people work at Deep Silver \u2013 there are good people there of course \u2013 or not because Deep Silver can't provide a service because they can, but because they're not really necessary because this was funded from the grassroots and now it is no longer a grassroots project.

Yeah, I mean, I have two closing observations about the trends right now in crowdfunding \u2013 you can agree or disagree and I'm curious what everyone out there thinks as well; you can let us know in the comments. One is that I kind of thought crowdfunding was waning um and not so much on some platforms but more on like Kickstarter which is really when that started of the Revolution, what I think is more happening there is that people aren't kickstarting everything anymore right games are starting to fail on Kickstarter things that would have certainly",
