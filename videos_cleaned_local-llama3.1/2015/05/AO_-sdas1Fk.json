Just want All Things Fall Apart, you know what I mean? There's so much **** that we do, guys. All right, question number one comes from Snarky Starky Dos on something like The Witcher 3 being 200 plus hours. How do people have that time? Is this too much? I think it's awesome. I don't think many people have that time, you know what I mean? That's the whole thing. I think I look back at Skyrim, right where I put 25 hours and 30 hours in and never beat the game. Right, I just went off and did my thing and then eventually got distracted and left, and that is that. Gonna happen with The Witcher, I don't know. I'm excited to get The Witcher and dive into that world and get lost for a while. Does it... Is it but it's I'm one of those guys who wants to try to do all the side quests or run off and do this or get you know what I mean like am I going to",

It's got about nine main story missions, and then each of those has got about two like secondary missions that split off from it, and those ones can affect the main storyline if you so wish. And if you do the next bit of the storyline, then those secondary missions have stopped. But once you complete the game, the open world is still available; you can still level up Geralt to 50 or 60, Quest score up to 50. So you can complete the game probably at like level whatever, let's say like 25. There's still loads more to do if you want to do it. Um, and from my time I've only played about like six or seven hours of it when I was out there, but like it was the type of thing where you would find quests off the beaten path that then turned into quest lines that kept going. So a lot of that 200 hours is not like stuff you are required to do. And what I think is most interesting about games like this in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim or Fallout, uh, is that the idea that",

The idea that you were playing a game and you had this great experience and you only touched about 40% of the content - that's as good for some people as actually going out and playing every single ounce of the game. So, yeah, in that way I think it's... I think it's that was one of the best things about Fallout 3 right? Would be coming into the office and being like, \"Oh, what did you do?\" \"I went and did this.\" \"Where is that? I've never heard of that or seen that.\" You know, I ran into this mission - it was this robot who thought he was the president. Like what are you talking about? That's awesome.

And it's like how many of these moments are there going to be in the game that are like not even side quests or or missions but just encounters? That said, I'm always skeptical of a a developer or publisher talking about how long a game is - we always call that Dev math and you can typically subtract 30 40% something 50% from a from a number given to you. Like when they say it's 12 15 hours, oh so like or 10, okay got it um but there are games sometimes where I",

I don't think this might be one of those games, but I think The Witcher 3 is going to be a game that I'm going to spend a lot of time with and I want to see it all the way through, but I don't know how much time we're going to have to be able to do that. But there's nothing wrong with giving someone 200 hours of content in a world where people feel like they're being nickel-and-dimed, where in a world where people feel like pieces are being cordoned off, where DLC is being sold to them - that should be in the main game.

Do you cuz I've literally telegraphed this for my girlfriend, I'm like look we've only been living together for like four months no real big games come out, like I've been playing games here and there and I've been diving into Mortal Kombat, when you were doing your own thing but like I'm going to be playing this game for like weeks and it's going to get weird and it's been kind of going to be in my Underpants, you're going to have to bring me the nachos and I'll just sit there so like how do you guys deal with that like do you still have that time do you like see a game that's got like 200 hours and think \"how am I going to find\" I mean for certain",

But I'm lucky enough that my girlfriend's super into gaming - she's currently on the quest to beat all the Witchers before The Witcher 3, oh really? She's already got one, she's done with one, she's into two now. I mean she's crazy but like when we came back from Mexico I wanted to play Borderlands, she wanted to play Borderlands so like for like a week right that was date night, that was our dates - we'd eat and we'd go and just play there and play Borderlands or whatever and it was great.

They're not really connected, but then they have their little weird sequels, and then like games like Fallout are like no, like they're all riffs on the same thing, but like...

Uh, but I think the thing that happens mostly maybe you guys have been in this gig a lot longer than I have, but the thing that I've seen a lot is that the games that suck you tend not to get a lot of access to and the games that are like the most confident, like we went over to play this Witcher 3 - we went over to shoot these features and we were in Warsaw for like 4 days.
