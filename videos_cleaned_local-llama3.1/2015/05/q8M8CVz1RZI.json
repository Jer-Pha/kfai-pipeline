John Snow hasn't tweeted in... can you give context? It's very alarming. Your Twitter account, I'll tell you right now he has one tweet. You're real, it's at Dead Space. I miss the fear and horror of opening the next door or turning a corner. Please fill my need. Did you ever get your knee fixed, John Snow? He's from Okinawa, Japan. Oh, so he may be in the military. This makes sense. I'm connecting the dots. I like seeing you making a backstory for the egg. The egg well, Jay O'Brien has one tweet. It says his location is Okinawa, a huge military base there. So either he's teaching English or he lives in Japan or he's a... he's a soldier. And so you would assume he's a big Dead Space fan. He's and so you would assume that maybe he's in the military. So if so, thank you for your service. And if my story's totally wrong, well thank you.",
