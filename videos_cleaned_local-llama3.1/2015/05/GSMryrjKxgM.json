Kevin, God damn it, we're finally capturing Kevin's... this is all your fault, Facebook told me to blame something on you; they were right, they knew I wouldn't need an excuse. BotW just has to be compelling; it's the same thing as what makes a good movie poster - it needs a white dude, he needs to be holding a gun maybe over his shoulders these days now he's walking away from us, everyone gives all that **** but that's like market research, that's why those games sell well and Resistance doesn't... you know what I mean?

It sucks that there has to be a mainstream cover, but you do need to do that stuff to get people in and see the content. The game is there; the box art doesn't affect the quality of the game. What really gets me is when people have reversible boxes - yeah, the super artsy one on the inside for the hardcore fans, and then the other side to sell it. It's like that's just what it is. But thinking about games with good box art... I think Grand Theft Auto is a really good example. There's a lot of cool colors, a lot of pop, a lot of stuff there. There's always the girl, and things that keep you interested. And it's like they have a feeling too - when you look at it, you know it's Grand Theft Auto, and they just kind of nailed it with that.

You know, I can't really think of too many other great examples, like on ones that come to mind for me, like Left 4 Dead, I think is very powerful because it's very simple but it's like you know what it is, and it's also clever with the hand or whatever. Um, I mean, like it's some, I think there's a tendency to overcomplicate things if that makes sense. And I'm going to use licensed examples, but I think they stand the right way when one of the coolest magazine covers, and this is again because I'm a fan, but I just think a cool Game Informer cover was their reveal of the Ghostbusters PS3, 360, PC game, that was just a black cover with the logo on the right side. I was like, that is so hot cuz that's a logo that speaks for you, don't need to know anything else. I thought that that would have been the box art and",

Being in the 90s, if you look at that, you're not like, \"I want that right now.\" You're either not a real person or you're blind - it's one of the two. Wow, what do you think of the Kingdom Hearts ones? As I know you're a fan of those, you got all the pretty much all the characters kind of piled up on top of each other; that stands out. The Kingdom Hearts ones are a perfect melding of the artsy style with the selling style because it is very artsy and it's pretty looking and all that, but it's also it has the Disney",

But um, but it didn't matter those games were really good; the box art actually betrayed the game that was inside the box. Meanwhile you had games like Deadly Towers or Wizards and Warriors - Deadly Towers actually is a great example of Athena Games that suck, that had great box art. Deadly Towers is like one of the great pieces of box art ever, but the game's awful. So like there's a lot of skepticism about box art, like judging what's inside the you know the game, and um or inside the cartridge or on the CD or whatever. And so I understand that level of skepticism, but box art really has to pop for people that don't know about games; that was why I was so surprised by Evolution's box art, I thought",

Maybe Moebius (corrected from \"Moss\") probably cared more about what that looked like than what the game was. But what really matters is what's on the disc or on the CD, and that was like an interesting departure because if you think of the box art from Final Fantasy II and III here in the states, it was just like the red with the logo on it for Final Fantasy II, and Final Fantasy III was the purple with the logo on it.
