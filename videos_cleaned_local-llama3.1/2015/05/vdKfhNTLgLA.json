I was tired, I should I was like I'm gonna do this side quest right and then I'm gonna get out and just explore, uncover question marks, beat up monsters right and then four hours later I was still doing that side quest because that side quest kept mutating and / mutating and getting all these different and I was like wait am I out here no because of the big I know I'm trying to find this person because I was looking for that person\"",

So with that much backtracking, I don't know, there's a deep minutiae to the game about everything you do in it, whether it's the quests, what there are six different types of quests, I think so, you have your hunts and your contracts, you're kind of a contracter, then there's like an alchemy system, yeah, which is a little convoluted, I think. I've never really gotten into that ****, I don't quite like that kind of stuff. This game is like a labor of love and others doesn't really make you do it, yeah, which is cool. There's armor crafting and weapon crafting obviously, and things of this nature, you know, enhancing your character with points that you get for leveling up and finding places of power there. I mean, there's just a ton of **** to do in the game, a lot of micromanagement, I wish the menus were a little less clumsy, I think at least",
