Do you remember this? Yeah, yeah, it was Pepsi, but it didn't have the brown heft; it wasn't that perhaps. No, you're right. Yeah, but I often wonder why do they feel the need to put these artificial because that's the other of the problem too is like these dyes aren't great for you either. It's like Diet Pepsi says one calorie on it in Ray Charles' days. So I want to give a shout-out speaking commercial; we talked about Coke a lot, but you know back in my day 7 Up was my jam. **Up** now yeah they **up**ped it all natural when I was in like seventh grade they made it all natural was **up** like they I think they did it because they were realizing that Sprite was the preferable lemon-lime soda kind of thing and then obviously Sierra Mist was like really coming up in the world.
