Um, I want to say something about this - I feel like he's going to tear the group apart. No, no, no, I mean I feel like there's not even a real question here as to if we're talking the scale of 1 to 10 of no beard and beard, Greg is definitely on the one, Nick is definitely on the 10. You are what we're doing - we're doing a ranking, we're not making a spectrum. Well, that's it, it's up to us how we rank okay, that's what I'm saying. There's a lot of different things to consider but what I'm saying is it's like if there's a yes and a no, we know what those answers are so where me and Colin fall into that, it's a little different.

So what I learned uh a little bit unfortunately later on with the beard process is that you have to kind of treat your beard like you would treat your head of hair. You can't like some people if it's really thick can do a uniform trim on it like right there, that's probably you. You take a Neat beard shaver, you put it down to like whatever quarter of an inch you do all around. What happens with me though is that certain parts of it grow in less thick, like this is super thick, this is less thick. So if I do that, there looks like there's no beard here and still stuff here. I actually have to take it and trim the beard with like they would the sides of your head and then keep the length here so it kind of points downward a little bit.

Oh good reference, you know what I mean? So I have to keep uh everything separate in its own little place geographically speaking and I have to do that and you'll see like this looks gross like I need to shave this down here. I mean it happens, it's hard man the upkeep on that sucks so you get extra points. I'm going to put Colin a little ahead of you on that one because yours if it gets thick it always looks good because there's no extra length here.
