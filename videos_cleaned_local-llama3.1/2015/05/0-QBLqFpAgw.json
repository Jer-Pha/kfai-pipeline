Now it's Kinda Funny live week, ladies and gentlemen. I guess just gentlemen over here. Yeah. Pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. Good to be here. Thank you. Good to be here with you. I've missed you. Don't rub me with your hands. I don't like it. It's one of the things that you say that no touching. You mean it. You don't like being touched. No, Cheryl gets me all the time. I was making her laugh yesterday because she was, you know, she ended up getting a place closer to work. So she's only going to be here usually on weekends now because her commute is like insane. So she was like, you know, can you lay with me or whatever? You know, can you lay with me? Like because I usually say she goes, she goes to bed really early and I go to bed late, but I'm trying to hang out with her a little bit more because you know",

Quality time. And then she was like, so I laid down with her and I started reading. She's like, can you come up with, she wanted to do position two and no position. She wanted to do position one actually. And uh, I was a little, and uh, I was, uh, I was like, oh, I agreed to lay with you, but I didn't agree to be touched. Ah, she got a little mad. That's a long winded story and really not worth telling Greg, but no, it was good. But nonetheless, I'm glad you told everybody over here at the pier with Tim Gettys. I don't like being touched either. It's a big thing in my life. How do you guys not like being touched?

You're all weird. Yeah. It's why you like being touched. Yeah. Like what does that mean? I mean like if, if Christine rubbed my arm and I don't like when Nick touched me cause Nick's got hands like sandpaper. Yeah. He's getting, he's never moisturized. He's a man. He's a manly ass man. There's a certain amount of Lubiderm in this house. So it's, it's shocking to me that, that he doesn't use Lubiderm more because it's almost everywhere you look if you just look hard enough.

I used to complain that my hands hurt. She's like, well, it's cause they're dry. You idiot. And so then like I thought it was just like her as a good natured human soul that she wanted people to be better. And so when I noticed Nick's hands were so bad, I told her at night one night, I'm like, Hey, you got to come up with a moisture plan for Nick. And she goes, why would I do that? I was like, Oh, I thought you just like helping people. I didn't realize it was just because you love me. I thought you just enjoyed giving people skincare tips and things. So last week, my girlfriend went to Disneyland to do this, this marathon and uh, which is ridiculous. Now there's a couple of things about this I don't like.\n\nNote: I corrected the spelling error in \"Luberderm\" to \"Lubiderm\", assuming it was a phonetic mistake for the brand name \"CeraVe or Lubiderm\" (a moisturizing cream), but since CeraVe is not mentioned anywhere else, I left it as is.",

Well that's excusable. Yeah, exactly. The other thing is I was, I was invited, but the problem was I was planning Kinda Funny Live. We were doing all these things, working really hard and all this stuff. But then, so I didn't see her for like a couple of days. Then I do see her and I'm tired as hell because I've been editing all these videos and staying up to like four 30 every night. And then we're trying to go to sleep and I'm trying to go to sleep.

The relationship's too young. Yes. You haven't been dating her for a long time. Yeah. So I'm just like high school sweethearts and together since elementary school, high school sweethearts that have been together since elementary school. But yeah, so no, that was my life.

We go hog wild with Kinda Funny Live, a million things planned. Then Kinda Funny Live will be in the aftermath when this starts posting on YouTube. So right now this is being recorded on Wednesday. The first two days of the week I was gone in LA playing Metal Gear. You guys have been working nonstop. Can you say that yet? Yeah, I can say that's confirmed on Twitter already. I can give you no impressions till June 9th. Cool. This is my first rodeo. I know. I know. So I come back today.

On top of that, we heard your cries. Love you so much. We heard this insanely complicated soundboard that you guys decided to set up today. Yeah. As if there wouldn't be a time crunch. Yeah. Things happen. It's how we do it. It's always the thing that the beauty about the four of us is that at all times where we all have our own agendas and we all have our own idea of what should be done at that moment. Right.

That's 100 percent true. So now the concern is how do we get the games cast fit in today? Because if we don't, then we've got to do it tomorrow. Colin and I alone, which is a great one. But if we don't do that, then there's not going to be a table or a camera or anything else to film with. Kevin's given us a timeout. What do you want, coach? All right. We got to put a pause. Put in a pause, everybody. Hey, Nick's here. Hey. So yeah, we were bringing everybody up to speed about the timeline and how crazy it's been. Yeah, it's been a little nuts.

But then we also need to do our normal job of like doing the shows and posting all that stuff. It's like it's so weird. We just keep touching the stove is the problem. We know it's hot. We just keep touching it like a munchkin. It's not even touching. Like, there's a new rule. No touching. But no touching. We're just like diving on that rule. You and I consulted.

And my favorite thing about Transformers is that the best Transformers stories and the most cool things that happen don't involve them transforming or turning into anything. It's just them and they're just characters and they happen to be things that can transform, but they don't. They act as humans would act. So it's like, they could have done that if the writing was better and all that stuff. That's the other thing too. They were weird foreign aliens. They didn't feel like real things.

They were always doing stupid shit, and they got away with it, right? Like, sure, something bad would happen, but there was never real consequences. Now, it was sort of just a play on life. Like, you know, I guess there are consequences to life. But you know what I mean. It was a show about nothing. When they would do anything, it just wouldn't matter. Nothing was supposed to matter.

Which is great. Yeah, no, this is a great episode. This is a lot of fun. I had a lot of fun with you guys. I like you guys a lot. It's good to be back. Where were we? I don't know. I feel like we haven't seen each other in six months. Yeah, I know. It really, no lie. I think since, so you went to LA on Sunday night. Oh wait, yeah, you weren't even in LA that long.

Since Thursday, I have not slept before 4 a.m. Jesus. Every night. And I just realized how long it's been. You look really good. You look really good. You don't have bags under your eyes and stuff. Yeah, I don't know. You look great. Well, it's the youth. I wouldn't ever have to get here. Oh, actually no, I haven't. I've been getting up at like 11 maybe. Oh, okay. And then working from then until four. Sure. This live show is gonna be the fucking, I said this on Twitter, it's gonna be my Mona Lisa. Wow. Yeah. You gotta keep working afterwards though.

Four, sometimes five, best friends bring a random topic to you. I got you. I got you good. I was trying to deviate. You really got me. You really did, I was like, is he dying? You both are ready. I thought you broke. This table. No, I missed it. This is the first time I missed it. Well, it's cause I deviated to throw you off for your Mona Lisa. That's foreboding now. That's my Mona Lisa. That was really bad idea. Why are you trying to change shit? Why does it matter? Why do we, where's the Star Transformers 4? It's Transformers.

Then we were excited when we saw you there. We hope cool videos have posted. If the door is like locked and everybody burned inside, it was probably Kevin's fault. We're sorry about that. Until next time. It's been our pleasure to serve you. I need to cut and make sure everything's coming. The camera's coming on a little too hot. Okay. Too hot. So the sound board is working excellent. I'm gonna tweak the level of the camera. Sure. I'm gonna cut this part out. You did the right thing. You did the right thing, Kevin. Excellent. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back with better sound maybe, or maybe it's been great the whole time. I'm gonna cut it when. I'm talking to nobody. That's",

You'll sync it with the clap and that'll be crystal clear anyway. Syncing with the clap. Great, great, perfect. Why are you syncing it with an STD? Yeah, that's weird. What do you want us to do here? And that's why you don't get touched. You can't get an STD if no one touches you. You are like a little pie that's been baked to perfection. You can't get an STD if no one touches you.
