This is how high-skill High skilled Mewtwo players play; t in case you couldn't tell, sit back and learn something. So Mewtwo wasn't never that good in Melee, and uh, I remember this when right before Brawl came out, I imported it from Japan so I had Prypyl (corrected to) Prypyl's powerful version, and then me and Curan went to go do a tournament before the game came out in America, and we just wrecked shop because no one had played the game yet. We just had him play as Meta Knight and play as Ike, and no one knew how to deal with them so that was great. But then when we were in line for that tournament, there was this guy who was pretty good; he hadn't played it. His name was Simon, no, there's this hot girlfriend, and they uh came over to my house after I was like, \"Dude, I got the game if you want to come play it.\" And then he showed us him playing as Mewtwo in Melee, and it was like unreal correct Jesus.",
