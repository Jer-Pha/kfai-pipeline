So my topic uh is uh I want I I've had this idea that I wanted to kind of bring to you guys since before I even brought up the Tier I wanted to discuss with you guys or or you guys to discuss um if you take the the kind of the three big failures of uh of the the three big companies right now, the Wii U for Nintendo, the Vita for Sony, and then the Kinect for Xbox. I kind of want to rank them and figure out the pros and cons and what went wrong cuz like they're all following up huge uh predecessors you know the 360's Kinect was great, the Wii obviously sold 100 million units, the PSP sold 80 million units, like what what went wrong and uh and kind of figuring out which is the best worst of those three items. I mean that's a great question, that's a really good question, 360's Kinect being great, I I remember it like flying off the shelves, I I didn't have a 360, yeah but but like",

It's like, well, why would I care about this? You know what I mean? But it's also timely because they just came out and Phil Spencer said today that he's still supporting the Kinect but that's like somebody said in the chat right like, \"Well that's like Sony saying they still support the Vita\" like there's a big difference yeah between actually doing something about it and like that sucks though the fact that it's not butling they're not I mean I don't know if that sucks it does I mean for me it's a market thing it's a free market.",

People watch Twitch on it, sure, but I watch Netflix and YouTube on all my other machines too - it's not the same thing. Mhm, yeah, you know? I got to stand up for the Wii U, I know it gets a lot of hate, but at the end of the day, to me, it is exactly what I need it to be. It has a lot of issues and you know the user interface is garbage and all this stuff. Personally, I love the GamePad, I love being able to play the games just on it - I think it feels right, I like that it's big, and when it comes down to it, it has the games I enjoy: Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, Mario 3D World.\"",

I hope that's not true cuz I love Star Fox but I I think it's going to be just super gimmicky, and it's just like here's that game that you you know this is why you got a Wii U and it's like okay well see I see here and I I don't have one yet but I I'm planning on getting one maybe when there's a price drop because there are a lot of games I want to play on it but I haven't hit that tipping point",

So it's like I understand why people love Nintendo, but then there's always this thing of just like, are they still producing the content you want? Like I don't know.

Whereas like with Mario, there's not a better version - there's just a different version. So yeah, I think... I mean my personal take and we've been vocal about this: I don't think there's very little right about the Wii U. And I think it's more about the hardware and that it was clearly not ready to come out and that they you know they rushed it to market obviously.

But no one was buying PSP games here, so again, like Nintendo misidentified the success of the Wii; Sony misidentified the success of the PSP and why it was happening, so the Vita was ill-conceived. I'm glad that they did it because the Vita is a great machine, and it's sold I don't know 10 million units maybe something like that. They don't really talk about it; you have to assume it's in the 10 million unit range, like the last time there was a number given, it was like around 9 million, so I imagine it's probably back up higher now, yeah, like you have to assume it's okay right?

Like this is the best skipping through all the PSP; PSP was something special. PSP was special. I'm glad you know selfishly that they misread the market, but just like I'm sure Wii U fans are glad that Nintendo did because there's something special for them there. But I'm sure both of those companies have a lot of regret for what they've put out into the world and that they have to kind of deal with it. Sony's at the point now where they can start phasing Vita out, and I think they're going to soon be like, \"That's time's up.\" You know, Wii U is new enough being a year younger that Nintendo has to hold on for a little while longer.
