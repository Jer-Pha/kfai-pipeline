So how does that work? You just add it to your download queue. It's downloading on my home right now, but okay, you have to redeem it as well. That's all yeah, but if so, I added it to my queue like yesterday, but I haven't been able to use my PS4. Okay, am I screwed? I think my PS4 is off, so it's not doing the auto download stuff. I don't think you have to download... Check out, you know, ripping it from the entire thing. There's taking it off the store in terms of being able to purchase it still. If you own it, it should still be there in the background, correct? Well yeah, if it's downloaded on your system, it's there, but you can never download it again. So they just whitewashing it from the store so you're... Yeah okay, when's it done? When's it off? It's supposed to be off today, today, just... But you have to understand that I",

The whole \"PT\" talk out of the way: should they take it off or should they just leave it? Yeah, it's a demo for a game, so I mean the whole thing was to find that is the whole idea of PT was to find that if you could beat it properly; that's a demo for a real game. So it makes sense for them to take it down since the game's canned, just patch it like the patch in Devil May Cry. Instead of it being like, \"Yeah, we're going to make another one,\" it just goes, \"Nope, this is probably the last one of these we're going to get to make.\" Norman is just like, \"Thanks but not thanks for playing.\" Yeah, I mean I understand why they're doing it.",

But will PT just kind of disappear in 100 years for ever, like is it something that is it going to be a lost game like these Mainframe games you were talking about on Colin and Greg Live yesterday?

Even if a company was like, \"We're not making any new Castlevania games,\" we just want all of the ones you already have. Like that would be money for years; they just re-publish them and put them in collections and do all these things. I would do that if I had the money and capital. But um... And I think there's money to be made there, obviously. But I think there's a reasonable path for them to exit the industry because they're letting their biggest guy go. So it's not like you don't make small games to make little bits of money; you make big games to make big amounts of money. If they don't want to make big games with big guys like Hideo Kojima anymore, then clearly they don't think they can make money anymore in games. So I think that's a harbinger \u2013 right? Like it would make sense if they were like, \"Well, when Igarashi left, it was like...\"",
