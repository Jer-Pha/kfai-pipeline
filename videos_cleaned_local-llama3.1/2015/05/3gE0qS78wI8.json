Let's take a look at this okay she's got some sort of dancer skirt on she's a little bit of a cowboy there's this weird tail coming out of her upper back which is not really a great look for her but she is wearing the Daisy Dukes yeah um which kind of saves it with along with the boots mhm which is doing it it's doing it um what's this thing down here what is that don't worry about is the Grim Reaper yeah so I'm just going to give you this one okay would it blow your mind if i told you that her name was Yuna because she and her are the exact same person that would blow my mind consider my mind blown so this is Yuna in Final Fantasy X right this is Yuna",

That's a question that people are asking. Here's the deal: I want everyone to just back up. I understand that Final Fantasy is an amazing series that has a really, really long-lasting lineage and holds a special near and dear place in people's hearts. Having said that, it makes no sense. I want you to know this to someone who is an outside viewer of this. You guys look like crazy people, yeah? Okay, be I mean that in the best possible way - crazy great people, but y'all are insane. This is insane, yeah. This is cray-cray. I mean, first off, look how like conservative she is, and then all of a sudden it's like here's the booty cheeks.

I like how people in these amazing series can just decide to be a pop singer and all of a sudden boom you're a pop singer. Kevin, I decided that you're a Peruvian giant, I don't know. So here's your friend, what's her name? Oh my God, I don't know if she's hot. What's up, she... you know what she looks like? She looks like every picture I've seen of Burning Man. So I'm going to call her... I'm going to call her Burning Woman. That's so funny, yeah it's very close. It's Rikku, Rikku. Okay, I think she's of age in this game; she wasn't in the other one.

Notice the little thong strings. Oh, I see the thong strings. I'm catching that. I'm catching the loose bikini top or maybe there might be a nip slip at some point. Uh, I don't understand why. I mean, I get the sort of irony of you're going out in a bikini and also throwing a very long scarf - that's hilarious. Um, and then as well, The Little Pony cowboy boots are just the hottest thing on the planet. Let's be honest. But she might have stinky feet; unless she's one of those little pegs with socks that go into them. So what does the third member of this girl group look like? Perhaps this - that's hot.
