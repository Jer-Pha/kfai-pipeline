I hate I have trouble with the perspective they're putting me in I'm missing jumps I shouldn't miss, and why can't I use a **** controller? But uh but features I think about, I mean my my beloved Resistance franchise has you know like the the whole thing with the Resistance games that that makes them special other than I think their story which I think is awesome is um the secondary effects of all the weapons and how like you know like the bullseye for instance like you can tag an enemy Advanced Warfare totally ripped it off, like you can you can like completely **** rip it off.

Like, this isn't fun, and it's like now they've found a way to force it into the main story of each game, and so you have to get at least one gold medal in the freaking talent contest. Sure, goddamn Pikachu; that shit's annoying as hell. It's not cool; it's a tale as old as time right now, but forced in multiplayer. Right? Freedom Wars was a great **** 30-hour experience by myself or playing with Christine or whatever, but then now there are missions I need three other people for... like where am I going to **** find three other players?

And and and there and there's a complexity to it with something like Tactics Ogre where it's like deep on a class-based system, deep on a grid-based system, the turn-based systems, the weapons and armor, the magic, the way your characters evolve and and up level up and stuff like that, and it all makes sense and it all fits. That's the beauty is when a game is so systemically complicated yet it works together like a Beau like a beautiful like you know play on a stage or something and every every piece is is right in place and nothing feels out of place and and then that's that's so on the other end of the spectrum is you can have deep complexity with",

I think simplicity is often king, you know. We think about Super Mario World for instance on the Super Nintendo - it's not that different from Super Mario Bros., it just has more stages and a few more powers, but basically the game's the same; they're very familiar. If Colin could see one in 1988 and play Mario World in 1991, he would understand how to play the game, yeah. Um, little small iterations are often better like that, and I think simplicity is often king, and that's why a lot of the games that we love most, I think, are the simplest - you know, and I don't mean simple in that they're easy; I mean simple in that you can understand them, and it's the rigors of playing them that can be difficult, yeah, not the complexity of the systems.",

Will I think that about Tony Hawk? It's freaking probably not it sounds stupid but I mean I I'm you know I'm waiting to see what they're going to do with this, I'm I'm a huge Tony Hawk fan from way back too, but I only played like the one two and three I guess and then I just stopped.

It sounds dumb, but Tony Hawk was kind of always dumb. I mean, that's the thing - like Tony's always been it's very arcadey, it's very let's get a high score, let's can I do that? Oh, I can.
