I mean, I always end up resorting to the Military Victory, but I want to try to win it in other ways. And you can win in other ways, I think we have to choose our person and explain why, but I think we have a lot of people who are console players who don't know PC games, what exactly is happening in this so it's God, I don't know who I want to choose. I guess it really doesn't matter. Yeah, you're not going to beat it unless you're really good. So I'm starting the game; it's going to take a minute. So uh, I'm playing as Harun al-Rashid from the Arabian Empire, so I get trade Caravans which are really useful and make you a lot of money later in the game anyway. Uh, Civilization 5 is a turn-based game that begins at the very beginning of a civilization and goes all the way far into the future. Okay, into when the civilization is mature and future-era.

I mean there's different ways to score based on how much land you have or how successful your economy is or whatever, and it's basically a micromanagement game. Um, so we're gonna begin our journey and every game of Civilization starts like this. Uh, what's wrong? Well that noise. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm trying to fix my mic. Uh, you can see here in the right corner it says Sid Meier's Civilization. Um, and this is like basically the part of the map you're looking at, you can kind of see the fog of war kind of out the rest of the way. Um, and basically all this yeah is fog, and you have different kinds of people, like this is my economic advisor telling me what I probably should do or whatever.

I do, I do love Marriage, so I'm going to close that, I'm going to learn that in a few turns and I can also start building something, so I can build a Monument or I can build a Warrior, a Scout, a Worker, and it'll tell you how many turns it will take. Gotta um, my Economic Adviser is telling me uh, you know that I can build units as much as uh, as much as I can basically. Mecca has one ability to make a unit at a time, whether it's a building or a person, a group of people if that makes any sense. Now she's recommending um that I build a Monument first and",

So these are things that you have to keep important - it says the Monument increases the culture of a City, speeding the growth of the city's territory and the Civilization's acquisition of social policies. So doing this seems useless now, but it's actually quite important later. Gotta... and again, my workers need instructions, but there's not much I can really do with them yet. And so I can go to them, I can move them around if you know, and kind of just start searching around and seeing what else is around here - if I want to find an ocean or a lake or a river... we find that one.",

So, you're basically doing this over and over again. Eventually, you've found new cities; you have more territories before you know it, you're spanning the entire globe basically got um. If you want, you run into other civilizations. These civilizations can be run by real players in other parts of the world or you can play against the computer which is what I like to do. I was going to say let me guess you, you, you don't play against yeah no I don't want to play but I can use I can use these guys right now to kind of just get rid of some of this clutter if I want and just keep going to next turn.

I don't think yeah you know, like I think that there are things that happen that I don't quite understand still. But I played this game extensively, I mean scores and scores of hours, and I don't think I really understood it until I played it for maybe 30 or 40 hours and lost a few times and all that kind of stuff. The game gets really unwieldy, I mean there's so much going on at the end of the game that if you don't have a good computer it can take a minute for them to like even calculate all your moves and stuff, that the game definitely slows down.

Um, animal husbandry still learns next turn, and so, so here we go. Allows workers to construct pastures on cows and sheep, and we saw the sheep and kind of cows on the map. Also reveals horses, which are used to build powerful mounted units, and you can actually find horses and trade them to other people if you want. Um, so I can learn more science, and now this opens up other things.
