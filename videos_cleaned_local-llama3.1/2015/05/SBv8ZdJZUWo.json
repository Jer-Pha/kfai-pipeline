They are like individual games that are like a handful, like a half dozen games that are designed in a way that makes them competitive and designed in a way where they can be leveraged into like tournament-like structures. So it's it's not like a sport which will be around for decades; most of these games are going to peter off and have new versions of the more like they go Counter Strike Back in the day, like I know there's like a resurgence in Go and whatnot. But like everyone knew that Quake wasn't going to be around in the next 10 years or so. Uh, and like that fundamentally changes the person who want to like the culture of what that thing is because it isn't something where people are like \"Oh, I like watching all of these.\" And they're different people to the people who like watching CS:GO; like NBA versus WNBA.

What's weird to me is like that people get so caught up on the words of sports like why why is I mean the fact that there's an e in front of it is just like I feel that's the the worst thing Colin if they were just Sports and people like their Sports people would be upset about that obviously but like why are they not Sports what is a sport and that's where we get into a huge problem chess sport exactly I mean that's the thing is that you know I",

You don't have to disparage these people because they're doing something that you don't understand, which is really what the problem is. Now, in terms of definitions, to me, something a sport is basically something that's athletic. Right? And so people were asking me like, \"Is golf a sport?\" and I'm like, \"I don't really know.\" Is bowling a sport? I don't really know if it's a sport or not. Hunting, driving a car - no. Here's the other thing: but this is why there's different degrees in different gray areas because it doesn't disparage what it is. You have to have incredible talent to play golf; you have to have incredible talent to bowl at a high level and you",

But I feel like the physical thing is the one weird question there. But like, besides that, if you just read it, a contest or game in which people do activities according to a specific set of rules and compete against each other.

No. But that's the thing, though: is there traditional sports that you can do non-competitively similar to Uncharted? You get what I'm saying - like shooting hoops in your driveway, batting practice, bowling... yeah, bowling. That's a good example. There's an interesting point in the sense that it's just one of those things about how we define words and what things mean.
