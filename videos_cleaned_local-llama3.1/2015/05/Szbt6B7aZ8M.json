Let's play Panzer Dragoon five years later, crash crawls out or whatever, and Panzer Dragoon is playing as he's being dragged out by cops. David Chappelle was the sickest, smallest, most fierce person I've ever met in my entire life. He was not afraid of a fight; he was fantastic. Thanks, guys, as always for your incredible support. We hope to see you again soon. He's not coming into a Kinda Funny Live, but he is going to see us when we go down to Texas, I think it's RTX, well, it's also Screw Attack though I can't remember which one. It's one of the two; Texas is a small state, you can just drive across, you can walk it probably; it's like a four-hour drive. I heard Bernie Sanders from The Office and hit the Screw Attack and hit George W. Bush in his head at Texas Rangers stadium. Damn, always a pleasure, guys. We'll see you soon. Bye Luis.",
