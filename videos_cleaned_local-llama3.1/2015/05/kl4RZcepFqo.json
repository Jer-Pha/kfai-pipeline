The one thing is every once a while I take out his guitar yeah Ted you know and he's like calling over some zombies man and then he'd kill them all. He's a famous rock musician, uh survivalist, that is like a survivalist big time. He has like a compound right, compound, he likes lives off of his own land and all that stuff. When I met Ted Nugent it was when I was back in Missouri, he came through to two or some ammunition like gun whatever store I forget whatever a huge one in Columbia, MO guy right big NRA guy so I went I got to go meet him and stuff and interview him along with some other reporters and we were like in a little thing and he pointed me out he and he's like \"what do you think kid\" I was like yeah cuz I was like the youngest.",

Where he knows how to hunt, but he also knows a shitload about MMA, so he could train all of us. So, as we all know in the zombie apocalypse, the zombies aren't the dangerous people - it's the other people. And so, that's what we have to really worry about. The zombies are easy; you just kind of walk away from them as long as you know how to survive and can hunt on your own, you're probably going to be okay. It's when we run into... a year into it where everyone that's left is some raw dog stuff like this - we're going to be right, and like we know that it's them or us.

I think Allison Brie would want to make it dirty with you, Colin. Oh my God, I honestly do believe she'd be fantastic. Thank you, I appreciate that because she's so incredible that it's like... well, I'm funny, I like her, I'm gonna die.
