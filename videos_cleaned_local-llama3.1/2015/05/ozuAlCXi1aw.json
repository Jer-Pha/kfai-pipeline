So, we decided we're gonna make a new show. It's not really a new show. It's just something that's not a Kinda Funny Reacts, but we're just going to do it. And it is called Nick Names. Nick Names. It's genius. It's ready. Today, we'll be naming video game characters. Yes. Now, what's really exciting about this is I handpicked a bunch of video game characters that I wouldn't say are obscure, but they're also not necessarily the most obvious. But to all of you out there, you're going to watch this and be like, \"Nick, how do you not know that?\" And Nick's going to respond saying, \"Cuz I'm Nick Scarpino.\" Right. Yes, that's true. This is going to be a good thing. I'm excited about this. Yeah. Now, real quick, we are sponsored by Casper.com/KindaFunny. Use the code KindaFunny. You can get discounts and stuff.
