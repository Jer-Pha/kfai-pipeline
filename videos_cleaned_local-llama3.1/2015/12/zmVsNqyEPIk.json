He was like, \"Literally, yeah,\" and that was the moment you're like, \"You're not done, you're no Ken Ham.\" Wow, I'm okay for people I don't know.

We saw nicely that was a good slate of indie games; it was it was so I cannot to announce. Yep, Shadow Complex; I was really excited. Yeah, that's coming back hopefully it's a harbinger of things to come in terms of a sequel. Mmm Walking Dead Michonne yeah this is working out. Shaq Fu, a legend reborn; oh my god no one's excited about my god that is Shaq; it is good why hire though of course Jack was awesome I don't know I I didn't like that Oh what the game the game is doing what it should be doing I think it's hitting that like I just like the Shaq Fu models traps uh-huh like you have these shows that they put these shoulders on the Shaq menchaca shoulders yeah it was like 14 like they were just like how many muscles can we put",

Out a picture of Fonzie jumping the shark because tell Hayley suggests disappear for a little while I'm getting sick of it. Can I tell you why I'm excited about it, please do? Because as the Arkham games have gone on farther and farther, and they become more about like how many people can Batman punch in the face within 13 seconds? Sure, or how many rockets can he shoot out of his car? I like the idea of a Telltale game that can maybe give a little bit of depth and credence to the actual detective part of it and to the Bruce Wayne part of it, which is very sweetly missing from the Arkham series.

It's too much. It's the same reason I was excited when they announced the Marvel games - the fact that now you can take these and have them in a more comic book-y way where I'm going to be reading along, making choices, be internalizing what I'm about to and what happens when I go without. Without Telltale, you can't make like a game for instance, like a Spider-Man game that has like what some of the most iconic Spider-Man scenes of all time - which is like Peter and Mary Jane talking about whether he really has to take on so much. You know this? You can really get into the story. Yeah, and Greg says but it's just like you just don't need to play the ones that you like and the other ones.

You're right because right now they have an engine, they plug content into it, and we're going to get to a point where everybody's like, \"oh, I know what a Telltale game is,\" and I'm not very interested anymore, I'll have to switch it up again.

But reading a lot about it is that for a lot of people, their saves are still broken and yeah, eating through them or just chugging along.
