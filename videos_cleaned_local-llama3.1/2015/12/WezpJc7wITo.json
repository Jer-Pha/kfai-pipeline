It would have honestly been so funny that even just that it's the same content, but that would have made the conference good. People would have enjoyed playing it is important, yeah, yeah, because Paragon would have been the announcement. It's always good to start with a strong announcement from somebody you recognize and then hit them with the emotions at the very end, yeah, and the surprise, you know, the Final Fantasy Versus XIII reveal was anything more this year, um, so like having now for all we know those three cut together minutes are literally all that's working, you know, um, but yeah it's like, but to me I got to start this off.",

And now here's the thing: was it disappointing that there wasn't an announcement or wasn't something? Yes, very, very much so. If they ended the conference with that, I would have been done; that was just like it, because Crash - that is the one announcement I'm waiting for more than anything.

You know what's interesting to me though is like it wasn't The Last Guardian, it wasn't Horizon, it wasn't these like PlayStation first-party things but seeing things like Yakuza, that got a huge pop, and seeing Ace Combat 7 and stuff, and I think so it's different like that was for the fans. You know you're not going to see those games at an E3 press conf no, I think I agree with you, I my theory is this something was cut out of the end of that conference and and the conference ended early uh and it was just there was just a conspicuous absence of something I'm not saying it happened the day of or the day before I just think that there was a plan to show that like to show I really",
