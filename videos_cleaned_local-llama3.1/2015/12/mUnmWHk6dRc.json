It's like, \"Oh, cool, even more!\" You... wait, how is it? How is it faster than Space Mountain normally but also take longer? That's impossible. Time Warner getting the beginning is slower, so that lasts longer. Longer - you mean the most boring part about not being boring isn't boring when you're in a tube of Star Wars, okay? Trust me, alright. It's amazing. So then you finish that ride; you're like, \"Alright, what else am I gonna do?\" And I guess I'm gonna go to Star Tours. If you don't know what Star Tours is, Greg, I don't.",
