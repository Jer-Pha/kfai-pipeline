And it's disturbing to me, and it turns me off a little bit now. Um, when combined with again the very greedy nature of season passes and the very kind of suspect nature of why games aren't delayed more and why there's so much shame in taking a little bit more time or why a company has to crunch to go gold and then crunch again to get a patch ready for day one - like, why is that acceptable to us? Look at Tony Hawk's Pro Skater as a great example of this.

Like, there was so many patches the patch I think was bigger than the game; it's true. And and I'm like, what's going on? Why are we this wasn't possible back in the day, so it didn't happen. Yeah, now it's possible, and it happens all the time. And I would rather be the exception to the rule than the rule. That's what's happening is that you know I go through my games sometimes, and I just click; you know, you know the options button, and I look at the details. And I was going through my cross-media bar or whatever on PS4, and I was like, \"The only game on here that doesn't have a patch is Mega Man Legacy Collection.\" A series of games released in the 80s and 90s; there's no reason to patch you know um",

But size isn't really relevant either. It's it's the nature like why can't we expect that why can't we expect that a game is going to work when it launches unless there's always a problem? Yeah Nintendo is the one you know we brought up Other M before and which was the only game that really bit him in the ass during the patch period um. But they can even patch their games now.

So people are starting to learn, but it's these are little like dense in the armor right, they're not 343's game was profitable and I don't wish anything against 343, it was just an example of, or Assassin's Creed, where it's just an example of, like, are we rushing games, are we expecting too many games too soon?

It doesn't seem like people are being taken care of anymore the way they used to be. And you can understand why a lot of people are just upset at publishers all the time. Um, and why I kind of respect when a game like DS3 or Death Stranding (I think it was Death Stranding) where these games are delayed sometimes indefinitely. You know? But like Death Stranding getting a six-month delay means that that game might have been there might have been something wrong with it, you know.
