Just like my boy Trevor Starky did he says \"Hey guys, now that Minecraft's on the Wii U, do you think that it'll move Wii U systems? No, no I don't either but I do think it's interesting that Nintendo made a big deal that 'oh we have an announcement not the biggest deal' but they're like 'oh we have something big coming on Monday' and then it was just it was Minecraft. What I was talking about I shocked that it wasn't there already, I thought it has to be some kind of deal right? That the reason this is happening is because they can port it then easier to NX and it can be an NX launch title too and just be there. That's my weird is so it came out and at least as of right now you can't do management and stuff with the GamePad, it's just a screen exactly.

So then Wolf 047 says, \"What prequel games would you love to be made?\" Give me a prequel to Infamous where I just play Cole when he's just a bike messenger and it's just a Paperboy clone and it's on Vita. What if Paperboy was on Vita? No, the prequel to Infamous - the Paperboy is the prequel. The prequel that I always wanted back in the day, that I... I don't think I'd want so much now, but definitely when when the time was right, I would have loved a Final Fantasy X prequel that was the pilgrimage of Tidus and Yuna's dad - I don't remember what his name was, but them doing the same thing and the original story that they keep alluding to and stuff. I always thought that would have been pretty cool. I don't know... something not something I think about right now. I don't really think.",

I think it'd be cool. I think that would be cool too. Yeah, I wish there was more little things like that going on. I wish I me D. That's the thing is ever so often they loan the license out and they do something like Scribblenauts DC scribble. Like that's a great idea. Why don't you do more goofy stuff like that?
