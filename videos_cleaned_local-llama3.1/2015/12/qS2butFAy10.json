In the entire games industry. SVP of Sony Worldwide Studios America, Scott Rohde. Hello everybody. Scott, thank you for joining me. I don't I don't see you in front of the camera enough. So, this is a great this is a great that you are an underutilized asset on the on the Sony chess board. There you go. Moving pieces around. Shuhei is like a general pushing pieces around in this and you're in the back. You're in the back doing important work. Quarter mastering, I'm going to say, but you really need to be up there fighting the battles. And so, we have you here right now. You know what I'm going to ask? Glad to be here. Yeah. I have no idea what you're going to ask me about. What are you going to ask me about? Where is that Sony Bend game? Today was the day. You just have to be patient. Just because you say it on",

Just because you say it on your prediction show doesn't mean it's going to be real. No, but I I will tease you and say, \"Uh, yeah, we were there this week.\" Um, and I'm really excited about the progress. It is really looking great. I love it. Shu loves it. But timing has to be right. What uh You don't even know what to ask. You're speechless. You're like, \"Just show me the game. What is it?\" When I saw this on, you know, we set up our interviews beforehand and we, you know, I'm like, \"All right, well, let's talk about this.\" Great. We have nothing, you know. So, I I want I'm curious. A lot of people have been talking back to me about the last podcast that you listen to on PS I Love You XOXO about what's what's taking them so long because it's been 4 years since their last game.

Is it are the rumors kind of true that maybe they were prototyping some things or some things got canceled or shifted around and this game kind of started later? For the most part, that is true. I mean, I think, you know, it's very difficult when you when you're starting anything new, right? Um, and I think, you know, Uncharted was such a big thing for them. Um, and, uh, I mean, Golden Abyss still in my top five for sure on on Vita. Um, they did try a lot of different things and, um, it took them a long time to settle on something that we were all happy with. Um, and again, keep in mind that is a small team. So this is not a 150 man, you know, 200 man Naughty Dog style team. This is small team. So takes a little bit longer to get a prototype to a point where we can start massaging it. And so that's kind of where we are right now. Fair enough.",

So, it takes a little bit longer to get a prototype to a point where we can start massaging it. And so that's kind of where we are right now. Fair enough. What's the process like? I mean, and I'm not asking specifically about Bend, but when a studio has, especially a studio that's been kind of using other teams' IPs for a while, you know, they obviously are responsible for The Last of Us: Part II, which is one of my favorites, and then they did Uncharted. Um, what is the process like to say like do they come up with three ideas and and you know, there's a shooter and there's like whatever, you know, almost exactly that. Yeah. Um, it's my favorite thing to do, right? When you see a team, you know, they every team kind of gets in that scared phase where like, \"Oh my god, what are we going to do next?\" And you're going to trust us to wait until we get it right. And that's what I love about Sony is that",

And that's what I love about Sony is that we are willing to wait and make sure that something is baked properly. I always use that phrase because I think that's so important. You can't just say formulaically, let's crank this thing out and you got two years to do it in this budget. You know what? That's going to be a fail every time. So we prototype a lot of stuff and sometimes it gets to a point where you spend a decent amount of money on it and then you decide maybe not for us. Um so super fun to do that with any team that's building something new. It's a really fun process and the teams stress about it of course but they also appreciate that we give them enough leeway to do something special. Yeah. They must be anxious up there especially to show the world something. They're getting to that point where they're excited. Right. But",

But again, the the thing I want to talk about, and this is true with any team, when you see a team, probably the most exciting thing for me, when you see a team go from that prototype phase, oh, maybe that's not it, then back up here, oh, maybe that's not it. Oh, we found one, but it's going to take a while to get it to a playable point. When they go get over that hump, they get to the playable point and they can't wait for you to come see their next milestone. Everyone's smiling, everyone's happy. That's where we are right now with the Sony Bend team. Just can't wait to show you guys. It's very exciting. Uh, but not today. Yeah, but not not today. I feel like you guys live just to annoy me.

We talked to Shuhei Yoshida a little bit. He said he had actually played uh I don't know vertical slice. Somewhere in that process also, right? So they're they're on the earlier end of that process. This is more recent when they finished Second Son and First Light. So they're on the earlier end of that process, right? And again, Shuhei Yoshida did play it and I played it and it's it's fun. But even the things that we have played at this early stage doesn't mean that that's exactly what it's going to be. Yeah. But that part's still so much fun. I know you can't I don't know how you're going to answer this question, but you'll ask it anyway.

So, I thought that I really I actually like the DLC more than the regular game. It's actually my favorite game to date on the platform. It really is. I love that game. Is this something you guys want to kind of see going because with Cole's inclusion in All Stars and all this kind of stuff, it seemed like it was going to become a thing and then my assumption is Sucker Punch might want to do something else. So, is this something that you guys want to see in the future like come back to Infamous or Well, I mean, we're never going to retire an IP. I mean, I think that that's one of one that's a personal favorite of mine as well. So, we're always going to be open to that. It's about the best way I can",

Not enough people bought it. Nope. I know. Make the Kinda Funny fans buy it. I tried. You know, I try I talked and talked and talked about that game. Um, let's move down to Kinda Funny, you know, you're in San Diego, uh, nearby somewhat Sony Santa Monica. I talked to Shawn Layden a little while. It's a long commute, but yes, I do it about two times a month. Yeah, I I did it once with some PR people. Drove back drove back and forth when I was doing the history of pieces when I was still at IGN. Um what's happening over there?

Um, but it um, again, so when Shuhei Yoshida comes to the States, right, you know, we we love it when Shuhei is able to come. I mean, he's just world traveler. He's always all over the place. And we try to arrange, you know, a way for him to visit as many studios as possible when he's in the States. So, yeah, we went to Santa Monica. We went to Bend. Those were the two major stops.

How am I going to break him today? How am I going to break his will? I don't need to practice. It just comes natural. You're a Jets fan. You're used to disappointment. Absolutely. Oh my god.

Like you have this awful dream that they're actually going to make the playoffs. Good luck with that. Brutalizing me today. One of the questions I've never asked you in any of the times we talked since you kind of are helping to manage this portfolio of studios. Is there any interest in gathering another studio to acquire? Are you guys like in a sweet spot right now or you guys kind of like is that something you ask? I think we are kind of in a sweet spot but we're always open to it. Right. So remember I mean there's things we worked with Sucker Punch for what a decade before we acquired them. Right.

We're always looking at that. Cool. So, there's no, you know, there's there's not a write up on a on a whiteboard somewhere in the Sony offices that says we have 12 studios and that is the number. It's not like that, right? Yeah. Oh, man. So, what what are you excited about next year coming out of first party? I mean like we next year is going to be a pretty great year if everything hits their dates and I think they will. So you have The Last Guardian, you have Uncharted 4.

First of all, free-to-play whether we like it or not, it's a prevalent part of the industry we all love, right? It's there. There's a whole generation of of young game players.

You can play these games if you want to grind and play these games forever without spending a dollar, you can do it. So, is that part scary? Sure it is. Yeah. But it is what it is.
