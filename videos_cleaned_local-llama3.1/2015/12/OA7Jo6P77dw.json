I just watched recently a great documentary called \"Soaked in Bleach,\" which is about the conspiracy behind Kurt Cobain's death. You're familiar with this? I know a lot of people think Courtney Love killed him, and this has a lot of really interesting damning evidence, but it also doesn't present the other side right. So what it says is all the things that the Seattle Police Department messed up and why they should at least reopen the case, which is interesting, and some could argue that's what documentary film is used for. It's on Netflix; definitely check it out. It's beautifully made, too, because they do dramatic reenactments that are beautifully filmed \u2013 they look like films, they look like a movie.",

And then because um the story really follows the main person who was the investigator that she hired to prove that to find him when he had gone missing. Even though about halfway through he was like you're lying to me, I'm going to start recording all these conversations. So in the dramatic reenactments the dialogue and the scene will cut out and the real recording will pop in. And throughout the whole film, you're like holy **** she is literally incriminating herself right now saying like yeah I mean I don't know, I said if you watch this it's pretty hard to not at least think they should reopen the case now.
