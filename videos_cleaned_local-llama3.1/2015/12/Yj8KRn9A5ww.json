You might be watching it somewhere else that I don't know of and if that's the case, they stole from us. So find that person, Nathan Drake. Today we're playing a game called Uncharted: Drake's Fortune Remastered. Which I can only imagine is a remastered version of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. No, of course, the classic game that I never played because I've never been a PlayStation person. I'm Nick Scarpino. I was always Xbox, always movies, always food, always protein, but now I'm coming around to the right side of history and we are gonna start with Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. I played the first like maybe hour of this game back in the day. Didn't, wasn't crazy about it. So I'm interested to see, now that I'm an adult, jump back into it, a little more perspective and see what we get into. Let's go with it. We're gonna start with",

Are you sure you want to be defiling your ancestors remains like that? You make it sound so dirty. Besides, thought you didn't believe me. Well, I did do my research and apparently Francis Drake didn't have any children. Well, history can't be wrong enough. For example, you can't defile an empty coffin. What the hell?

You gotta just talk right over me. This relationship's not gonna last. When Drake sailed into the Pacific, he took the Spanish fleet completely by surprise. He captured their ships, he took all their maps, their letters, their journals, and he recorded everything in this diary. Uh-huh, so this... But, when he got back to England, Queen Elizabeth confiscated all of his charts and logbooks, including this one, and then swore his entire crew to silence. Yeah, so this...

Sully, you're on your own. I made it! I'm okay! All right. Now it looks like we're getting somewhere. After that, we better be. All right, can we walk up a little faster? Come on, guys. I get it cinematic, but you know, I got some place to be. Get a burrito later. All right. Oh man. The temple must have been built around this. Around what? Statue. A gold statue. A huge gold statue. And look here, these people, they're worshiping the damn thing. At least, I think they're people. Of course, El Dorado, the golden man. Sully, it wasn't a city of gold, it was this. It was a golden idol. Man, can you imagine what that thing would be worth now? Not as much as an entire city made of gold. I'll tell you that right now. I don't really know physics, but I would imagine that statue city. We're 400 years late for this party. I'm",

Just, you know, put this on the map. Now, I'll just continue to jump on these things. Toward this shiny thing. Oh, nice. Let's go. Just let go. Let go of the stupid thing. Sounds like this I wish I could run. Wait, Sully, do you hear that? There's something you don't see every day. Coal. Oh, my God. How'd they get that up there? Let's go check it out, Sully.

Clearly they want me to go right there, but I did not see that. Because I can't see everything. Okay, I'm playing the game. You guys are all watching out there, spectating. But I'm in the thick of it. I'm the one trying to find Drake's Fortune, or Drake's newest album. All right, where the? Yeah, get me out, dog. Hold on. Why can't I get out of you, Lake or River?

You're absolutely right. Oh God. God, he's so strong. I'm gonna be so tired. Thank you, Sully. How nice of you. Oh, you felt that one, didn't you? Hey, you should be able to drop right down into the Ubar from there. Way ahead of you, Sully. Nathan Drake. You gotta keep practicing or else, you know. You might lose it. Go, woo. Go. Harrowing.

Getting deeper and deeper in this old ship. But I suppose everything's okay because it's been here for years, so nothing could possibly happen. Don't touch it. Wait, was that gold? Elvis Presley. I mean, not for nothing, but those coins are like a grand apiece, maybe just like, take a few more of them, bro. Pay for that boat you blew up back with the pirates.

Find anything, kid? UK 2642. UK. Is that a periodic table? UK 2642. Gotcha. Are you all right? Sully, you're not gonna believe this. Try me. I think I found our missing page. You're kidding. Looks like Drake and our German pals were after the same treasure, and I've got the map that's gonna lead us right to it. Nate, this better not be another wild goose chase.

It's time you told me that you two were onto something big. The find of a lifetime, he said. Well, I was intrigued. But he's made grand promises before, haven't you, Victor? And here we are again. Another fool's errand. Dude, does he always go on like this? Oh, my God, my kidneys. Right in the ass. All right, bro, just maybe go one more button down. Let's finish off the look.

Well, not to end on the cliffhanger, everybody, but that was the first hour or so of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. It was really good, I liked it. I'm gonna keep playing it. Thanks so much for bearing with me, the three or four of you that are still watching. We had some good times together, some exciting adventures.
