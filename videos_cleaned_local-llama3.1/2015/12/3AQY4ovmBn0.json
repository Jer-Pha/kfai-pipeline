There's a key difference between those two games - one of them that Amplitude has a highway of notes like you would see in a rock band, sure. Also made by this little developer called Harmonix, hey guys. But before that there was Frequency. Now Frequency had a tunnel... oh, oh! Now what if I told you you go on the options here? You go on the options, okay. And if you unlock this and there it is - Freak Mode, Freak Mode, Freak Mode. Get freak nasty, The Legend of Freak Nasty! You can turn it on, okay. And what... what do you think that does, Greg? I'm assuming now the Amplitude looks like the Frequency exactly, okay. We got our tunnels back, ladies and gentlemen. This is a big deal. I want to see Frequency, Amplitude, and then I want to see Amplitude - Ampy, you a few Frequency frequencies! I can... I can do that for you. Let's let's get into this.

Here's a pro tip for some people out there: so you play the game with L1, R1, and R2, yeah, right, and that that's how you do it, but you can also hit square, triangle, and circle as the left up or left middle and whatever, so for some of the bits like you saw the guitar bit there where it's like no, no, no, no, no, no, really fast, like hitting that's kind of hard. Feathering it, so I like to just square, square, square, square, square, and it sometimes makes it easier. I learned that trick back with Rock Band by Blink-182 in Amplitude, the OG Ampl... oh okay, yeah. So think that's where they got the name Rock Band from, from the song \"Rock Band,\" yeah, probably \"Rock Show.\" The name you just said, \"Rock Band,\" was confusing.
