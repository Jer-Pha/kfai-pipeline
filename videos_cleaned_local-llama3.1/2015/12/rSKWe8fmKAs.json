Hair was definitely on point. On point. So, we saw a new trailer which blew my mind cuz I did not expect we'd see that. Then afterwards, we get all this way more news about this game than I think we expected to get. Now, mainly it's going to be Oh, did we get a release date? No, we did not.

It's going to be broken up. Uhhuh. Into parts. Oh, that sounds terrible. You love parts. Wait. So, what are you guys' thoughts on this, Colin? I'm sure you're thrilled. Someone on NeoGAF said, uh, it's too good to be true. And that was like one of the first comments I saw after that after that. And I was like, yeah, that's a great way of putting it. A, um, the episodic thing is nonsense. I don't care how they spin it. I don't care like what they say. It's  **** nonsense. I don't care about it for a minute.

I'm not like a I'm not like in love with Final Fantasy VII by any stretch of the imagination. I think it's a great game. I think it's an important game, but it's it's certainly not the best Final Fantasy game, but it is sacred in some way. And I'm not quite sure what they think they're doing, you know?

What's I got some thanks. Yeah. Yeah, I remember that you really hate Final Fantasy VII. So, we sat in a room uh where I railed on Final Fantasy VII for a very long time. So, this is not coming from a Final Fantasy fan, but like you, it's the game that built the PlayStation. I understand the importance of Final Fantasy VII in people's lives. I don't mind. And so I got excited as somebody who is not a fan of Final Fantasy VII when I saw the sort of Kingdom Hearts Final Fantasy XV combat system added in. I think that's interesting. I'm interested to see where they go with that. As far as episodic, that just answers that just makes so many things pop into my head. Whether I like the episodic or not, I have logistical questions.

I have logistical questions about the last 20 hours of that game when all you do is fly around on the overworld and and just tie up loose ends and breed Chocobos and get your villa and do all your different little things that you do. If this is episodic and the first episode is leaving Midgar, I go back to Midgar. Can I go back to Midgar anytime and finish things that I didn't do? Am I as I unlock new new parts, do they all connect somehow on my hard drive and technically and inside of my PlayStation and know that now I have the whole game and I can go back and do whatever I want or am I being fed along in a linear fashion along the story points and different highlights of Final Fantasy VII.

But if it affects the sort of feeling of freedom and the and the ability to go around in the overworld and do whatever you want, that's a huge deal. That breaks the game. How does that work technically? See, I am completely on the other side of this and I don't think that that's a surprise. It's like if I want Final Fantasy VII as it is, it's this game does not ruin that game. That game is there. It is now on the PlayStation 4. You can buy it, you can enjoy it, and everything about it is great. This is a different experience and for PlayStation 4, modern **** all that stuff. Is it going to be more linear? Absolutely.

This is the game I think is going to be way less about the freedom and the openness and stuff, and yeah, the people that really love Half-Life 2 are going to be upset about that myself included. I get that, but it's like give me something different; this is different. I love Kingdom Hearts; this looks like a way less floaty Kingdom Hearts, which I'm like great, that's really cool. Looking at the battle system, it's very obvious that it's early because like there's like a summon option, it's like there's no way you can summon that early in the game so it's like there's that's just there for the demo and stuff, so it's like I want to see where they take it all.

No. You know, I I don't have these delusions that we're getting this game like this year anymore or like next year or whatever, you know? Yeah. But it's like I do think that we'll get it earlier than we would have. At least a taste of it. Do I think that we're going to get a a demo of the at least the bombing mission when you buy Final Fantasy 15? I do. I think that they're going to do that.

They weren't going to like it anyways. So it's like I think that this it's a smart thing that Square is doing. Do we agree with it? Is it, you know, what we want as gamers and oh, I want to spend $60 on this experience, finish the game, whatever. That's just not how things are anymore. And it's like, that sucks. But what I am thrilled about is you see that trailer and the story is there. You see the characters and you're like, \"Holy shit.\" Yeah, that's what that character should look like.

I was most impressed looking at this trailer when it started and I was like, \"Oh my god, they're not showing Tifa. They're not like, yeah, there's Sephiroth's not there.\" Like, they're literally showing the beginning of the game and it is shot-for-shot remake and it looks awesome. Somebody on uh somebody on YouTube cut them together side by side and it was very very interesting. I mean, it's like when she kicks, they kick like it is.

Especially with Final Fantasy XV and Kingdom Hearts coming out, like this is the fact that this is happening is unbelievable. But it's like it is. And the fact that we saw another trailer at PSX, it's really happening. The fact that they're talking about being split, they're preparing us. Should we be thinking of this then more in the more in in terms of like a movie, more in terms of Hollywood movies where it's like, well, you had your Batman and now my kid has his Batman and we got to be okay with that.

Final Fantasy VI is my favorite Final Fantasy game and I know we're never really going to get probably a remake of that. You know, maybe we will one day. I think we will it makes me scared now because I think what they did with um you know with one and two on PSP that was great.

The Four actually was like really hard, too. It was it was a hard it didn't look like it was going to be a hard game, but it was way harder than, you know, the SNES version of the game, which was dumbed down. Um, so to get seven and just see it kind of it's going to be bastardized in a way. And I think that that's I'm telling you like that's going to rub a lot of people the wrong way, man. I I don't care like what they do to it aesthetically because I think that the game I agree with you like beat for beat. I think you know that's a really exciting moment. With the way Final Fantasy 7 opens with the bombing and stuff is is is a really cool opening sequence on the train and it's full of kind of uh it's like a thriller, you know, and you don't really know anyone and Cloud's kind of like along for the ride and you're meeting",

And you know, because there's a lot of environmental Final Fantasy VII is an environmentalist game. Yeah. Um which is lost on a lot of people for some reason. like it is an absolutely a game about environmental environmental message because of when you start getting into like the Advent Children when they started doing the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII stuff. It changed what Final Fantasy VII was. It it like Cloud is not this emo gothic Hot Topic kid that doesn't talk, you know?

When I saw it, I was like, \"This looks **** awesome.\" And I felt the same way about the trailer when we saw it, you know, with Cloud walking through Midgar, whatever sector they're in. And, and it's, it's what I have a problem with is is what the gameplay looks like. And I also have a problem with who's working on the game, you know, like, and what they're already saying about it. CyberConnect2 is working on this game. I told people that months ago, and there was, you know, that rumor is old. And, and I heard the rumor that the same people that other people wrote about",

And they're not bad, but what I'm concerned about is there are two things. A, Square Enix doesn't have the internal resources. Didn't believe in this enough to do it internally, which is a huge problem for me. This should be a game that is treated with all the respect and care that it deserves, not necessarily for me, but for the millions of people that are going to buy it, that want a Final Fantasy game from the Final Fantasy team.

I know that's confusing all this, but I'm talking about time has passed. You know, they are not doing that. But but their Final Fantasy XV, a game that is about active battle system.

It's not easy or something like that where you're running around hacking and slashing. It's clearly not that. It's menu. But well, so Final Fantasy VII is fun. No, I know. Totally. But here's my thing. It's like, \"Okay, fine. So, what we want is just a totally just upresed version of Final Fantasy VII that is like just looking this way and in it's like Final Fantasy XIII battle system style stuff where Lightning's just jumping around doing all this crazy **** **** and all you're doing is waiting your turn X waiting your turn X.

I think that's what they're doubling down on. I think Final Fantasy VII is so beloved by Final Fantasy fans that they know that they have your money. They know that they have the money of the people out there. And now what they need to do is get a new generation of people to fall in love with Final Fantasy VII and care about it the same way that everybody in their, you know, late 20s, early 30s does. And the way you do that is you make it look like Final Fantasy XV, which a lot of people who don't like Final Fantasy went online, went like, \"Oh, this is a Final Fantasy that I think looks interesting.

And I think, you know, I don't want to be too pessimistic about it because we really don't know what we're having yet. I'm just looking at all the tea leaves. The one major thing that Greg and I were talking about is Square Enix put up a translated thing from Famitsu where they were talking about, yeah, CyberConnect2 is working on this game in some respect. And they had alluded to, and I don't know if it's the translation or what we're talking about, but they alluded to maybe even other teams working on it.

So there's already all of these and again things are lost in translation from Japanese all the time. I've been covering Japanese games for a long time. We know that that happens. But from what I was reading on Kotaku and and and you know that's a very reliable site for Japanese news, you know, translations and all that kind of stuff.

And so, they need us back. And I think that to your point, that's maybe what they're aiming for. And Final Fantasy VII Remake looks great. We we played it at PAX East and I and I enjoyed it. Yeah. Um and I'm optimistic about that game. I don't know when it's going to come out. I don't believe it's going to come out next year, but we'll see.

You're talking about like literally just the battle system like cuz so far that looks very recognizable besides the battle system and even then it's not like it's drastically different like when you look at the areas like there's so much side-by-side comparisons where it's like not just the scenarios they're in but it's actually the environments where like they're fighting in that like the circle with the fountain and it's like that's straight out of the pre-rendered background but now it's an area you can explore and they're adding stuff and in the original game when Oh, Avalanche blows up an explosion",

I'll say this they by doing this by saying that they're doing this by committing to this they are taking on what is probably going to be one of the most one of the hardest and most thankless jobs in the history of gaming. No matter what. Yeah. They were setting themselves up to lose. No matter what it'll never be as good as the original.

Otherwise, you'd be waiting forever for this game. But then keep in mind that like how many times, you know, Square Enix went out of their way to update the Final Fantasy XV demo. You know what I mean? Like what we're talking about right now is it's going to be under a microscope. And I have a feeling every little thing that's said about it, they're going to think about, well, do we want to make episode two different? Do we want to change it?

That's what's scary because that goes back to what Colin was saying is like don't fiddle too much cuz what you're doing is you're if you do that if you're depending on the on all this feedback and the episodic structure to let you know what to do with this game, then not only do you have design by committee, but you're basically doing like the Pontiac Aztek of gaming, right?
