I have rollerbladed probably in 20 years, but yeah, I mean, I think if the dream was strong enough, I think I still can. I still know how to roll. If the dream was someone right into... to the other uh Playstation podcast that you guys did, if I'm remembering correctly, and they said that it's a real thing, like dreams can have a profound impact on the mind.
