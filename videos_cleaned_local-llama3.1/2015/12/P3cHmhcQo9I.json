Like how has that changed? It's constantly changing, and that's not the problem, but for this question and why people get so offended about it, I feel like to go back to it for me there was a moment in time at IGN where we had been on the 100-point scale, which meant you know, you're 7.1, you're 7.2, you're 7. We moved to the 20-point scale, which meant 7.0, 7.5, 8, so on. And then we decided, and I say IGN decided, to move back to the 100-point scale, and I fought valiantly in my own mind not to have that happen. My problem was, and this is where I think we get down to the problem with video game reviews, is the fact that the 100-point scale to me meant that this was scientific; there was a rubric that we all did, and you'd sit down, and you'd put in these numbers, Here There, and you'd come to this score.",

Here There and you'd come to this score, you know what I mean? whereas I always thought the 20-point scale now known as the Oricon scale was better because it would be like this game's a 7.0, this game's a 7.5, and you can then put those into buckets and then argue about why this 75 is better than this 75 or da da da if that's what you want to do which is weird but that's what the internet wants to do right? But for me when I first started at IGN and it was a 100-point scale, right, there's a distinct sect where okay yeah I reviewed Uncharted: Drake's Fortune gave it a nine, I reviewed Infamous and gave it a 91, and then I reviewed Arkham Asylum and I think gave it a 92 or a 93 but I think for the argument 9-2 right, and the way I came to those scores was",

And the way I came to those scores was I thought these games were amazing, and I think Infamous was a little bit better than Uncharted One, and Batman was better than both, so like that was how I did it. Now that didn't cross over to Eric Brudvig when he was reviewing; he wasn't paying any attention to what I did as far as the points were concerned. Whatever Damon Hatfield's on the record is only ever giving zeros or F's - you know what I mean? Like, that was like this thing that you went through and did, and it was just how you came down to it because I mean, like of course you talk about a night-and-day difference between where IGN is now or at least when we left IGN; God only knows what they're doing now.

Is there a proof? Is there a copy editor?\" And he's like, \"I just put it up. I'm sure you've read it.\" I was like, \"Oh, Jesus.\" Coming out of a newspaper where everything was like... you know, it was like four gatekeepers before anything even got remotely to the front page. It was crazy, and IGN wasn't that way anymore, right? Dan Stapleton is now in charge of reviews at least when we... he still is, but when we left, that's the thing \u2013 I've seen us be at IGN long enough to see it change, change, and change.

In so cuz, like for me, the way I scored games was I'd finish a game and in the beginning, I would take notes here and there or whatever blah blah blah. And then I found myself never referencing the notes, and so I would stop doing that. So I would review games and sit down, and what I would do is sit there and go, \"All right, what was the best moment? What was the most important thing? What's my takeaway?\" And then start the review there and go from there, telling you that thing. You know, as we evolved and everything else, and I feel like it was more embraced at the company to talk about what your opinion is, you know what I mean.

And there'd be comments asking for that, and it was always like, \"I get that,\" but there's 12 other reviews out there right now at embargo that are telling you what I mean. Like, I'm going to go in this direction and do that, and sometimes it was well received, and sometimes it was dead space. To, and that's it, you know what I mean. And it's this interesting point of convergence right now. I feel like where as we were breaking away, and then broke away, right? Like I think everyone was starting to wrap their head around what a personality was and how this works and what is a critic and how this... d d.

I think one of the things that Greg didn't touch on because I think we have a lot of same opinions on this, I mean first of all review scores are stupid, I want to reiterate that numbering reviews is stupid and I don't understand why anyone does it and I don't understand why anyone would like it or why they would want it. The problem with it is that reviews need to be read through the lens of subjectivity and when there's no cross referencing of of um of scales between Outlets, the numbers become meaningless, that Metacritic becomes meaningless what when Giant Bomb gives something three stars that isn't a six you know what I mean like",

The game the way the game feels to play that's why we play games and that's always most important to me. Greg might not agree in fact like Greg might look at the Last of Us which I gave a 10 too because of how it played and its narrative and Greg might give it a 10 because of his narrative and then its gameplay, and those are two different reviews even though they come came to the same arbitrary number so what I'm saying is that I think that some of the impetus",

It was a fight that I fought by myself but it was something that I was like, why don't we buck the trend and try something a little different here where we can and focus on the content of the review just like we would focus on the content of the game and you'll find much more enlightening things about a game when you just read what a person thinks about it and there's no score at the end.

Um, 10 made the most sense to me for the score, but I would have loved to just write, wrote you know, 1500 words about why this game is so fantastic and maybe some of its little problems and then let people make their own decisions because they might see while Colin really likes the narrative and that's what I'm really playing for. So I'm going to play The Last of Us and some people might be like, wow, the multiplayer is really surprising and I didn't realize that and how is that reflected in the SC?

That's why it was so frustrating when they didn't want us to speak in first person anymore at one point at IGN, like different editors, different review people come in and they change everything around, and that was hard for me because then it started to be \"I\" instead of \"we,\" you know, where we're at right now, and the fact that you know how Colin feels about this and Greg and this or",

I think back to when I used to read IGN reviews before I worked at IGN, and it was IGN gave this game whatever it was, and I think that is what it is to this day, that's what it is to the majority of people out there, and that's so terrifying, you know what I mean. Because how many times do we fight when we were at IGN how many times we fight now about what we think of a game, you know what I mean? Like, you're I can't believe you think that, and I read Matt's tweets about games and I'm like are you kidding me, that game's not nearly as good as you know what I mean. But for somebody to think like that's Bible truth, that's when I loved the fact of infusing who you are, what it is, how it goes, you know what I mean? Like, you're my example of that always is Naughty Dog.\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n* \"me because then it started to be I didn't my I\" -> cleaned for spelling and grammar\n* \"IGN gave this game whatever it was\" -> added \"this\" to make it a complete sentence fragment\n* \"Mitch's tweets\" -> changed to \"Matt's tweets\", assuming Matt is the correct name (based on Kinda Funny Games' hosts)\n* \"are you kidding me that game's not nearly you know what I mean\" -> cleaned for spelling and grammar, added \"as good\" to make it a complete sentence fragment\n* \"Naughty\" -> capitalized as it refers to Naughty Dog, a video game developer",

Um, yeah, so I just think that we have to figure out a way to review things better and we have to continue to evolve - not necessarily at this company, but just everyone in general - and then I think also the consumer has to look, has to accept that they might have to look at reviews a different way too. Because if we can just be a little more open-minded about what a review is capable of and take them a little more seriously, then lo and behold you're going to get way more out of them. You know, the more reductive you want to look at a review, the more reductive what you're going to get out of the review is going to be; it's just that's just math.\"",

I gave it a 4/5 if I just looked right on the Metacritic page; there it pops up on Google, yeah, four five out of ten. Went into the tunnel, no service or whatever came out went right to work at GDC, and like hours later checked my Twitter, and it's just like, \"Are you ****?\" And I'm like, \"What is going on? Like, no one's even played this game.\" And I looked around; Gamespot gave it an eight, and all this stuff.
