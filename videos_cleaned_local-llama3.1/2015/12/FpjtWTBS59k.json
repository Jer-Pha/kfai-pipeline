Yeah, no things are going really well coming together really nicely. You know we've got a great presence here at PlayStation Experience um downstairs uh the you know here in the convention center we've got Kill Strain and had five members of our community show up in full cosplay uh walk around down there. We've got Drawn to Death and David Jaffe is down there um interacting rubbing elbows with uh the fans, and then of course we got Guns Up that you know Scott Rohoway announced on stage today. And happy as I'm refreshing on my phone, the player counts people are downloading it playing it so we're really excited.

And and it seems like you've fully embraced it how has that been going for you guys so far in terms of kind of nerves a little shot about how this is going to work out are you confident that this kind of cycle is going to work for you well game development so I'm always nervous right um just nervous for different reasons um but yeah you know uh in San Diego um you know I guess it really all flows for me I'm a bit of a risk taker if you will I like tilting at crazy windmills and I decided free to play about 4 years ago um free to play was a windmill I wanted to tilt that you know it has such a negative connotation in the phrase at times with some people I think is unfortunate because there are great games out there uh and I just decided you",

And so I don't know any other way to be than all-in. Right? So we've got the three titles that are all yeah using that business model, but we're not shoehorning it in; it's not a formula where they all have to match and have to be designed and monetized the exact same way. Uh, what we did is what we always do: start off just trying to build great games, and then the business model happens to be pre- to play. That was a question I was asking Scott before in terms of you kind of have to lead with great games right to make this work; you can't just put like a like a shitty game out and be like, well yeah. So I mean is that the idea to say like we really could maybe charge $29.99 for Drawful 2, but we have to have a game like",

But the team just keeps you know cranking out a AAA title and and the fact that they're able to do it, able to bring new features, able to add polish to existing features, able to you know strengthen subsystems within the game improving it, you know we know online isn't where you know online play isn't where we want it to be yet and we hear the fans and we continue to work and iterate on it.

And I'm really excited for The Show 16; it's coming along beautifully. And uh, I, I guess I'm kind of curious. I asked you this when we wrote history to Sony San Diego years ago, and I'm curious again: You guys used to work on an NBA game. Um, is there... you guys have sports bona fides; you guys understand baseball at least, and and you can attract talent that might understand basketball or hockey, whatever it would be. Is there a desire to make Sony San Diego, at least this part of the studio, away from the free-to-play kind of more hardcore games? Uh, maybe more of a sports club? Are you guys interested in chasing the NFL license? Do you guys want an NBA license? I mean, is that something you'd like to consider? It's all uh, so absolutely. You know, I think it's... I think it's definitely a topic that comes up for us every year when we think about what direction.",

I mean my hat's off to them; you know, uh, I'm glad that they're focusing on that and not baseball. Um, we own the baseball space, and and I think that there's a real opportunity for us to continue to deliver there. I think I think there's still a lot of room for growth with baseball helping people understand that there's this amazing product that they can that they can enjoy that they don't necessarily need to be a die-hard baseball fan to really appreciate the hard work and the fun that be had playing the show. Yeah, I'm I'm uh always impressed with that team; I don't I don't know it's just it's so fun to watch them work, and and people who were really into that game always comment that something meaningful.",
