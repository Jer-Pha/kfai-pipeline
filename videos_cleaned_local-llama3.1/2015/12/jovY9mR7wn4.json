These people are so excited to meet him, you know, him dinner developers live creator, so it's super fun to be in these countries and talk about new stuff. And we are, they are very excited, right, right. So here's the question about VR, yeah. When is PlayStation VR's big push? Did you hear the shows and I'm always like remember in areas like it's gonna be 20 minutes, it was like two minutes here. I was like well here's we'll sell to all of us like the hardcore gamers and there wasn't a good portion of the present a crusty idea but it wasn't like here's the launch date here's a price here's a big game you know what I mean, yeah?

Yeah, what we said. An eagle flight shout-out to Eagle Flight - that was awesome. We just want to thank you. We just started talking about games this past week. Yeah, we focused on tech since last year to this GDC, where we were introduced with the latest tech. You know, super great experience. But you know it's only since this E3 that you started focusing more on games, and every event we go to - like TGS or Paris Games Week - yes, yeah X. Yeah, announcer new games that will support PSVR, for sure. Whether this time, like, \"rails via its combo\" new games, and we are now talking about Psychonauts. Something. Yeah, so do you continue the way you started, with the groundwork plan in place at GDC?
