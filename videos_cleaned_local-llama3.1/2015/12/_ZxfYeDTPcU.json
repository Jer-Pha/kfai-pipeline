Um, and I'm not - I don't want to say I'm disappointed in it because I don't know if that's necessarily the right word; it's just that it's it's not quite what I wanted it to be. I was way more excited to play it than I was after 10 hours of playing it or after 20 hours of playing it, that's why I just - this year for me as people have noticed, I was going through my trophies to see games I played; I've not beaten many games this year because my whole mantra now is like I'm just going to play until I just don't feel like playing anymore, and uh, that's kind of where I got with Fallout.

However, considering the conversation about Assassin's Creed and open-world games, I'm going to take a guess that it was meant to say \"open world\".
