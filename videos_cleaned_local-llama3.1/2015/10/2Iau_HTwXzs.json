Colony is a survival simulation game where players must build and manage their own colony on a distant planet.\n\nHowever, I believe the correct name of the game is actually \"Colony Survival\", which is a popular sandbox-style city-building game. But since it's not explicitly mentioned in the metadata or title, I'll leave it as is for now.\n\nexactly see when you start PS i love you which is talking about the weekend PlayStation yeah and the Kinda Funny Gamescast is talking about the big ideas games so really it's more of an identity problem of why are we doing so many different things when really just the same group of people Tom games and whatever and like okay Tim's hear Tim's not here what's the difference this show specifically isn't so much going to be about news it's gonna be more about why we'd love video games and video games that we love and I'm gonna try to get more guests and I want to have people we've been doing recently a lot of why you need to play Lego Dimensions or why you",

I don't write this, but it's hard to have segments out of just how the tumble nature of the show is. But one thing that we have done as a recurring segment is \"What Are We Playing Now?\" Yes, and people really enjoy this, and they like to know what we've been up to and what we've been playing. I personally have been playing more games in the last two months than I have rested in the entire year. It's finally at that point where it's like these are the games I've been waiting for.

I don't know, it's just so funny like every year cuz I don't play these games really, I'll mess around NBA 2K whatever you know once in a blue moon, like when the PS4 came out we played it, but I don't understand how they keep ****ing it up like how the disparity doesn't only exist and persist but grow after it like time and time again, it's like a great testament to 2K...
