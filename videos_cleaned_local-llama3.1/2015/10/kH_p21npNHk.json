If you're in America, you will call Nick \"Scarpino\" for the rest of the episode. If you live in Europe, call him \"Fortuna.\" If you're an Australian viewer, refer to him only as \"Salacious Crumb.\" I'd like to be called \"IG-88,\" IG-88 if you are Canadian, refer to Nick as IG-88. Now, Nick, Canada, yes sir. You and I are bonafide online gamers. We...and by that, that's a lie. Actually, yes, we haven't done anything online in the last time I did anything online, I think I heard myself now. We're going to let's jump in. Uh, what is this?

You'll be watching this if you're watching the day we put this up, actually the day before the beta goes live for everyone, but the beta should run I think something like October 8th to October 12 on PlayStation 4, so you can check it out; it should be free. You can just go on PSN and download it if everything goes according to plan. The game comes out in December on PS4, Xbox One, I assume PC as well. Uh, thank you for watching.
