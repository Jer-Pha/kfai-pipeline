Top of the muffin to you. It's the afternoon. You just ate an apple. I did. I made a little bet with myself to see how I could get into the Apple before we actually started the show, 'cause there's a lot of shenanigans that happened before this right. Kevin is always there and he acts like he's ready to go, and then you are not we're not, and then by the time we are ready to go Kevin's off pouring himself a two little bottle of Coke yeah in the living room doing whatever maybe he's rolling around on the carpet scratching his own back I you got it all wrong. The thing with Kevin is that he needs to be doing I'm going to say 10, I don't want to offend you, I know it's more than that but at least 10 things at once and it's it's just he's never just complacent he's never you know feeling good about himself and he wants to make sure.",
