Then they released the uh Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD Collection a couple years back made by Robomodo, the people that made this game, and everyone, you know, either didn't play it because it was a small little downloadable game or didn't like it because it didn't feel quite like Tony Hawk should feel, and all that stuff. I enjoyed it; I thought it was great. It was very nostalgic for me. It didn't perfectly nail it; the physics were a little bit off, but overall the presentation was pretty good. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 gets announced, and I'm super excited. You guys have heard me talk about it whether on Twitter or in the GameCast or just anytime you anyone's ever spoken to me. I'm usually talking about how excited I am for Tony as 5. Then we see it, and it didn't look too good. Um, then you know we start playing it, and it didn't play too well, and then you",

Um, then you know we start playing it and it didn't play too well, and then you hear all the stuff on the internet about how it's the worst game of 2015. Did that stop me from wanting to play this? No. Did it make me upset? Definitely. But here's the thing: this is going to serve kind of as my review and my thoughts of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, and really I want to like this game - like, that's the most important thing. Is that more than anything, this is one of those games that is made for people like me; it's the people that are super nostalgic about this franchise, and you know the little things that they did, like wanting it to be like adding the five to the name - like, that says that they're taking this franchise back to its roots and you know giving us what we want. This is not that - this is really not that. As you can see of me just getting into some glitches now. I don't want to just",

It was fun to kind of do trick attacks against people and like you know score challenges and whatever, and the Tony Hawk 4 kind of created a real community of people that just kind of free skate with each other. This game is just a bunch of people just kind of in your map not really doing anything there's no interacting there's no anything going on so it's weird that they put focus on it like when you play a mission hitting X brings you into the online version, pressing triangle brings you into the single player, like that doesn't even make any sense. So here we are going to do the score attack but as you saw I had to load like twice and then then we get into the mechanics of the game and that's where things are probably the most upsetting to me like let me let me crash real quick let me just mess up all right so when it starts you don't just start moving",

I mean it's a skateboarding game, like it's designed to give you different things to jump on and like you know manual and do all that type of stuff, so I don't really think that's that big of a deal. But the level design is just not good. You play some of the classic levels in any of the other Tony Hawk games and they're fun and they're good and they're well-designed for the challenges at hand. When you look at some of these challenges, again, the super not user-friendly menu because the start button brings up this menu but the touchpad which I can't even do right now brings up the menu where you can like choose the missions and stuff.

Tony Hawk always kind of had weird gimmicky things and like honestly a lot of the missions that weren't based on just getting scores or like doing specific things were always kind of weird, you'd walk up to or skate up to some guy and they'd be like oh I need you to get three, it's fetch quests and stuff. And the way Tony Hawk controls has never really been friendly to that stuff because when you have to collect everything there's a lot of um you know skating around and the momentum so if I had to go behind me right now you have to kind of do that and like trying to hit something specific can be kind of hard like if I'm trying",

Back in the day when with all the other Tony Hawks, like I did that, I would beat the game as each character and I had fun doing it because all of the mission style, like the missions and the things you would be doing would be different and it would be you know exciting things to do here it's like every level is the same weird ass goals in every level whether or not the design of the level makes sense for that so I started playing and I was like all right you can go ahead and see the levels you don't have unlocked and I was like all right I have this Barracks whatever Bonfire Beach was which is like a weird modified version",

So each mission is a star if you play on amateur mode, you get one star; if you play on pro mode, you get two stars; sick mode gets you three. I had to get 15 in each level to get to the Bunker, so I put myself through this for a couple of hours just because I wanted to get to the Bunker. Let's check that out. Again, X brings me online, which I don't want to do; I just want a private game. Damn, I just messed that up. No, all right, cool. So here we go. This is very much like the classic Warehouse level.
