And then we got alarmed Marty; I think we're going to use alarmed Marty for this. I said that's stupid, and then people were like, \"Marty, Mother of God.\" Sorry, hold on. I clearly need to focus. Bring it over here so you can see it. Maybe if I do it on camera, alarmed Marty, get your head on there. There you go. There you go.

When you put Legos in a video game, suddenly I got a reason to play. So we're going to move some of the people off here. Sorry, uh, Gandalf. I'm going to leave Chell. I'm going to get rid of Wild Style, taking off Homer, taking off Cyborg. Now they're all here; I can put them back at any time. But what we're going to do is put Marty on there. You see him pop up here in the world? See that's really Michael J Fox. Everybody are we aware that that's really Michael J Fox? That's all I want to say, that's all I want to point out, that this is really voiced by Michael J Fox. Not saying super insane cool thing happening here, whatever. So now we're going to jump in.

Fox see this is of course a play on the original Back to the Future opening year ever making jokes about them stealing the Libyans' plutonium that Doc needed of course so you've seen Back to the Future so now this is a level pack where we get to play through the level pack it's more of that Lego stuff more of that Lego content and then I'll have Marty and I can use him we I'll get",

I wonder if Michael J. Fox is easy to convince to do this kind of stuff, you know, like we're doing something else. Back to the Future, will you come do it with us? I don't want to be Batman, God dang it! So you already get going here now. You know I'm going to hit this; you know what it's going to say: \"Drone access.\" Can use their drone now.

Then the machine broke, and Doc wasn't there, and like Marty had to go to the big game and not be like Superman, I guess. It was kind of like Teen Wolf too. Interesting.
