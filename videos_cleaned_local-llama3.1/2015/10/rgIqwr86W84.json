This is Outlast. We played a little bit of Slender: The Arrival. It didn't go too well. No, it went fine. What happened? We beat it. We didn't get Kate. We nailed it. Maybe we'll find Kate in this game. We'll see. Have you ever played Outlast? No, never played Outlast. I played I don't even know. Maybe a 20-minute demo of it at one point. Okay, we're heading into an asylum. Mount Massive Asylum. Guys, if you're going to name an asylum, name it something nice like Huggy Bear Asylum. Hugs and kisses asylum. Why is it going to be Mount Massive? Maybe I misread it wrong. Maybe it's Massie. Massive. It probably is. Mount Massive. Get out. Get out. Okay. Get that press badge, bro. Can you interact with it?

Okay. So, we're going to go. We got to get our handy dandy camera again. Camcorder. Camcorder. I'd like to think that Slender and Outlast is in the same universe. All right. Well, how lucky for me. Looking pretty HD. Cool. That's good. What? Okay, we have night vision. Thank you. That'll probably help us in the night. I would imagine so as we go into this spooky asylum. Mount Massive. What's fun, too, is making sure we go to the asylum at night. Mhm. That's fun. Okay, cool. Can I go in here? What's in here? Nothing. Okay. Nothing to interact with. Take your notes.

I don't know if you need it. I'm recording. Okay. See, in Slender, you had battery, but it didn't look like it ever went out. I wonder if it goes out in this game. Well, let's see here. Cuz yeah, it's it's going down. So, oh, I think I re just refreshed my battery. Let's not waste the battery. We're probably going to need the night vision. I'm not sure we get a flashlight.

I mean, I guarantee I could last longer. I don't think that's the the the point really. The point's like doing things and not making it last an hour where nothing happens. All right. You know what?
