And we all signed off on it. I played it; I brought IGN together; had told everybody this is how I felt. You voiced an opinion agreeing with me, uh, Sam Clayborne voiced an opinion agreeing with me for guides, and everybody said they were on board. And then about 6 months later, I said specifically during the meeting, \"I'm doing this so that if I give it a 10, y'all don't throw me under the bus later.\" And everyone proceeded to throw me under the bus later. That was not a perfect 10; they sure did which that was. Yeah, I mean for me like it always came down to the fact that and I talked about this a bit in Uncharted 2 right the let's play we just did in the fact that I I you know when we review games we talk about the words we don't talk about the numbers nothing's perfect obviously so on and that's not what 10 means exactly 10 meant",

Absolutely, one of my favorite things about this is my favorite opening of the three as well, right. Um, and uh, I just love the way this sequence begins, and I love the twist at the very beginning as well, which I think we'll get to - um, which was a well-kept secret with Naughty Dog; no one knew what was going to happen. It's very similar to the way The Last of Us begins: there's always a secret. Another thing I love about the sequence is...I wonder if we'll be able to see it; we'll have to look on the bar or whatever new [we] got to go to the newspaper. So this came out in 2011, two years - a little less than two years before The Last of Us came out. The Last of Us wasn't even\"",
