Metal Gear, I mean, I don't mean to cut you off; you want to tell your 401 real quick? No go for Metal Gear Solid right, like the opening, right, like so it's so funny now to think of a game opening with a cinematic and credits and music and stuff, but that did not happen when I was I was just starting when I got that PS1 and pop that in; Sniper Wolf, like there's so many amazing monologues and moments, holy ****. Um, the in Metal Gear Solid 4, two things come to mind: the well, three things, the microwave sequence, obviously, totally, um, the motorcycle chase scene where you're with Eva in chapter 3, I think that thing is the end of chapter 3; you're going through that was my first moment that I was like **** this is what NextGen means back then, like I was like holy **** I can't believe I'm playing this and",

I think there are moments there are like just little sporadic moments even in like Far Cry or like like stuff like that where you know you get a little taste of the cinematography for instance we were talking about in Drake's Deception, or you know interesting camera angles or interesting action scenes. But I actually those are not the moments that are most memorable to me in games. In fact, I think the the memorable moments to me typically are the the more thoughtful and poignant moments. Um I the ending of Fallout 3 for instance, I think that ending is cool as hell until you know when you have to kill yourself basically. Um but yeah, I mean I like I I think about the Journey or The Unfinished Swan or something like those are more memorable moments than like the things that explode.",

I think another one comes to mind for me is in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare when it's one of the first missions and like a helicopter crashes and then the the blades are like spinning at you and it like it stops right before it hits you and I remember being blown away just being like whoa like this is ****. That's Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, right? Yes, yeah that one was totally even when you're flying away in the helicopter and the nuke goes off and you come down I remember being like what the ****.

If you live in the Pacific Time Zone and you have to wait three more hours or whatever. Console launchers are always events. I don't think we have events like that anymore because I actually think that the volume of midnight releases and making something out of nothing is kind of happening too often. So um, Halo 5 and the new Call of Duty are going to be big, big, big releases but they would have been more special, I think, years ago when it was more rare to go into a store at midnight or to have your digital download ready to go and it's already pre-loaded and all that kind of stuff.
