I think you saw a little bit of our 2016 lineup and what we showed at Gamescom, but most people even internally as we've been meeting and kind of planning for next year are like okay this year we have Halo 5, we've got Forza, we've got you know like this must be like our peak year and then like next year must be down relative. But actually, we expect to sell more games next year and we actually have more game titles releasing next year than we do this year. And if you start to look at that list of things that are coming, so we have Quantum Break coming in April, uh, we've got a Killer Instinct season 3, we've got uh as you go throughout the year we've got things like ReCore, Scalebound, Crackdown, Sea of Thieves, Halo Wars 2, Gears of War 4 and probably some things we haven't announced so extra.",

Cup uh next year coming yeah good yeah no the team we're actually uh investing more in that title to make sure it is great as it as it should be and uh have a great partnership uh with with the guys that are building that title so uh you'll get your Cuphead uh along with your Gears of War four games of all sizes so yeah that's that's incredible because when now what I'm wondering I didn't I didn't even consider half of those games when I'm doing my mental countdown because you're getting to the Quantum Breaks, you're getting the Scalebounds of course but yeah Killer Instinct yeah that's coming Sea of Thieves yeah that's coming so what do you guys are you going to call next year the best games lineup in Xbox history again well you",

You know, Aaron, you've been in this industry a long time, you've been on Microsoft a long time, you're a smart dude, you understand this industry. I was reading MPD earlier this week and the numbers continue to stagger me for both consoles. Yeah, now Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are out selling their predecessors same month over month on the market for 24 months by 40%. Yeah, what does this mean to you? I mean, what are you taking away from this because this is such heartening news to me as a core console gamer. I don't want to play games on my mobile phone; I'm not much of a PC Gamer, although I...

We can't really worry about, we got to kind of focus on that.

How do you, as a studio or as really a team - because you're not you know, you're not a studio, but as a publisher - do you identify these partners and be like, \"We can work with these guys confidently\"? Or is there any interest in acquiring these studios to join the family? Like, how do you kind of parse that out and figure those things out? Yeah, so most of our big IP is done internally by internal teams, like Coalition with Gears or 343 with Halo or Turn 10 with Forza. And then all those titles we call them published titles.
