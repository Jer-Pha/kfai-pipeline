Exactly. That's a great point. I mean, the big thing about all of this is yeah, and it's it's the broad brush painting right, where I just talked about trigger warnings and how I thought they were dumb in this college, and this is from an article I read, you know, that was about this very specific thing, so that isn't a reflection on everyone's trigger warning or anything else.

I want to know your experience so I can take it in, process it, and then have my own reaction to it, and maybe it is that I agree you're right or maybe I agree that I stick with what I what how I feel on this yeah, and I just think it's important to just at the end of the day just try to be a good person. And sounds so freaking stupid and simple but I feel like so many people that get upset about this and like do kind of react to all of these things and react to get upset and like that wasn't politically correct and get angry about it, they end up acting more obscene and more like upset than than anything and that is what I think.",

The other thing being uh um my topic when I talked about recycling where uh people like using other people's recycling or whatever; oh yeah, people are making that sound like I was trying to say that like putting down the people that go around and uh my only point was I don't understand like how that's worth it.

What I you know personally since we talk for a living, I find it kind of interesting because I if you had caught me 10 years ago, I would say distinctly different things than I do now largely because I'm afraid of having that echo chamber pick it up and then blow it out of proportion but also largely because it's our responsibility as people who are putting out thoughts",
