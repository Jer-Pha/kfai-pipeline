The original Texas Chain Saw Massacre was perfect in what it was; it wasn't trying to be anything other than a terrifying quick roller coaster ride. Well, I think some of those movies at the time were reacting to certain things that were happening in society. I mean, a lot of the theory is because if you really compare the seventies movies to the 80s ones, the 70s are much more brutal. The original Hills Have Eyes is really upsetting; I'm not saying like fun upsetting, I mean like really really disturbing.
