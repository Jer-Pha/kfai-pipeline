All right, I do miss Anna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias, but are they together? This is something you're talking about on the stream last night that I couldn't have confirmed or is that still a thing? I don't know; I mean God bless him. Nobody can make relationships work, but if they've been going that long, Enrique can, you know he can. But the thing with Enrique is I thought he came out; no, that's Ricky Martin.

Pitbull has a song in like Fast and Furious one, and I'm like wow you were as old as the greatest film franchise of all time. So here we go, this is a weird thing. Anna Kournikova stated dating pop star Enrique Iglesias in late 2001. Anna Kournikova has consistently refused to directly confirm or deny the status of her personal relationships. In June 2008, Iglesias was quoted by The Daily Star as having married Kournikova, who was quoted as saying \"I could be your hero baby\" married Kournikova the previous year in subsequently separated. The couple have invested in a $20 million home to be built on a private island in Miami. So they were married and separated but they're still",

That's why Game Over Greggy should come on the show and explain it, but it said that she doesn't want to talk about it. But this is time to break your silence, I guess you're right. And if I had put up all those Canon Dual Shot ads, you can come on my show and talk about it. Remember this? Yeah, yeah, not buying the camera, go away!

You can appreciate that, I appreciate it, mean uh 'Escape Your Love' by Nickelback, we watched Jennifer Love Hewitt's breakout role in 'Heartbreakers' last night during our stream; we should watch that again probably, yeah, to catch up on this other one. We should watch that again, but then we can watch the others. Can't escape my love, I can be an evil baby. The theme song of Spider-Man is also by Chad Kroeger and some other guy.
