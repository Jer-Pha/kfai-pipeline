They got here a little late, and we got to respect their schedules as well. So we got 50 good minutes in, but I feel like I feel like the podcast wouldn't be long enough without a fourth topic. We had to do that; we need the fourth. We owe them the fourth, so we do. I went over to the Kinda Funny forums over at kindafunny.com/forums looked at the Gamescast topic for topic suggestions. If you have them, please go there, leave some. We'll get to them next week or the week after or some week in the following future, but gather a whole bunch of your questions together. We're going to go through them. Not so Xbox related, okay? So this Xbox topic is now I wouldn't be able to speak to that to to author just a normal topic. Cool, fantastic!

And then someone posted a picture of the United States, like a color heat breakdown of who gives a **** about this **** ass day, and it's literally just like the small little section over in your East Coast, right? My favorite horror game is Dead Space, yes. Um, although um how do we define this word too?

The new Fatal Frame just came out on Wii U, on the Wii U. I don't think anyone liked it, but yeah, uh I heard it was okay. But people were upset about censorship stuff - oh they censored it? Is that what everyone was upset about? Cuz I saw there was a lot of people get mad about upsetness, yeah which H that's a whole topic.

It reminds me of everything that I liked about Guitar Hero back in the day, Rock Band, and all that other stuff when it was fresh and new. And having not played these peripheral games in a couple years, going back to Rock Band - it's like... it is fun as it is, and it definitely is fun. I had a lot of fun with Rock Band when I've played it, all the ****, and all the things that don't work, and all the little little seconds of like why is this taking so long to load this thing?

And I remember when I first played the original Guitar Hero, the difference between having my fingers on the first four buttons and adding that fifth button and having to slide your finger was like a step that you had to overcome in your head. And with this Guitar Hero, with the new one, I've already experienced multiple steps in learning how to do it, and it's fun and it's awesome. The presentation's really cool.

I don't because of the it's even more than that because of the financial investment of getting these games being not comparable to a normal $60 game, because they're not. I mean Rock Band especially is just really expensive. It's funny because I was really of the mind that it was time for these games to come back and now I'm of the mind that I might have been wrong and that maybe not wrong for some people that are enjoying them. There's always going to be people that enjoy these games, but I'm really interested to see how these games do especially Rock Band which a lot of people seem to be down about and and I um I don't know I I I don't I'm not even really interested in playing guitar here even though I",

Have you heard about how Guitar Hero's doing this? Uh, I saw people upset about it but I don't know that so many people are really mad about it. It's a new style of microtransactions where you can't own the downloadable content for Guitar Hero; you can't just pay a dollar and have the songs. You pay for like play tokens and your token can choose to play the song, then there's things where it's like you can buy like 24-hour party passes where it's like $6 or whatever it is.

A moral yeah it's nothing moral or immoral about business. Um, is it a Sound Decision probably it bolsters Microsoft's in this case Microsoft's um uh exclusive portfolio. I'm sure that there was an exchange of money there's no doubt about that. I don't see why Square Enix which is the publisher would really want to um limit limit the reach of the game especially watching what happened with a game like Titanfall for instance which would have done much better had it been multiplatform.

But again, the infusion of capital from the public from the first party might make these games possible or make them break even without even having to sell a game. So um so there's all these business ramifications. How do I feel about them? I think it's fine. The gaming is a competitive Marketplace and these things do matter and they do work. People that are big fans of Tomb Raider will not want to wait a year, and if they don't own an Xbox, they're going to buy one so it makes sense. I don't think you know is there Morality In Business and immorality in business?

The imperative might not be on them to do that unless they can shave more money off. But since they just dropped the price of the PS4 as it is now, I will not expect to see a new PS4 until they're ready to drop the price again. And I don't think that's going to happen until next year or the year after. I think there too is the fact that they use the new versions to kind of promote and get another spike in system sales, you know.
