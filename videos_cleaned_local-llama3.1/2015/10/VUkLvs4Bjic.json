The background is that I started to write a response to this tweet, realized that I'm not at my computer enough during the day. This basically was going to start some kind of bigger conversation, not not start **** as much as this is a real conversation and 140 characters don't go that way. So I wanted to bring it up to you and everybody else here and talk about it here, and I'm just looking at Tim, bring I want to bring to the table and the best friends to talk about it and then go from there. Now I'll preface all this with it comes from a Destin Legend tweet. Destin is a friend of ours, friend of the show. This isn't beef with Destin at all, cuz other people were saying this but his is the one I saw. And what I want to talk about basically is shooting community college horrible tragedy as always uh we all we've heard it in the",

Guns are illegal in The Gun (there's a city called Chicago where) you can't even buy a gun. By the time we're airing this, it'll be some time before it airs on YouTube, and in the space of six or seven days, more people would have died in Chicago through handgun shootings than in that Oregon thing.
