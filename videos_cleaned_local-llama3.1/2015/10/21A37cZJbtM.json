Hi, if you have a topic you want us to discuss on this beautiful show, go to KindaFunny.com/slash/gamescast/topic. Leave a post and we'll get to it, just like we did for Sami H\u00c3\u00a4llsten (Holopainen). Oh okay, it was alright. I mean, I was excited. I actually really enjoyed this question: if you had to estimate how much money would you say you spent on games consoles and DLC? How much would it be? Oh, are we counting what our parents spent on us? Yeah, she's in college. I remember getting interviewed for a girl who was working on her journal class. Getting interviewed by girls... what I meant to say is, I said in whose journal class my freshman year? She knew I was big into video games and it was yeah, she actually asked me like what all I had owned and I ran it through all the systems. Not of a game, obviously.

I mean, because I remember I had this conversation back with my friends in high school where we'd stop and like... this is towards the tail end of like the Xbox, yeah, generation. I remember looking at all my Xbox GameCube and PlayStation 2 games, so this is just modern that generation, sharing looking at all and BMI all right, $50, $50 you got it up, it adds up. So oh my god, right, this is like thousands of dollars. Yeah, how did it... I don't have thousands of dollars. This doesn't make any sense.

Yeah, what games do you have? Like, oh, there's... And he opened it up and he was like, \"I've never seen this many games, you know what I mean?\" But we're dumb kids, so then you jump to the PS2 generation.

I also liked earlier when he came in with a sneeze, but it was just the most dramatic entrance he's ever made - my favorite. The Portal is never cuter than when he comes around and just jogs in because he just looks up at you and he just looked perfect; it just looks perfect. You're perfect. 182 asks another cool question: a Box Car Racer, Blink-182 reference - it's gotta be yeah, okay... or it's Boxcar Racer.

I wish people would just continue to make things that don't touch each other necessarily in terms of plot or setting or whatever. It's unnecessary, but what does it add? Yeah, if The Last of Us was a prequel to Uncharted for instance, like that's just...what does that do? I love it. There's something about that, even if it's not necessary, you know, super forced and super explained and stuff. But if those were in the same universe and it was just little mentions here and there, then they might be cool. Like that type of thing, I love that. I think that's really cool.
