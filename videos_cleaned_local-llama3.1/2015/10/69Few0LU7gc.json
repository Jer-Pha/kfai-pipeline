Yeah this is spiring off into a different sect now this is a whole different topic of conversation of well this is very much what we talking about to draw back to my original point though is that yes but that duality can't exist in one person, it's when you start start peeling off those super stupid superficial levels that you can start understanding that people are more than just one word or one phrase to define them right.

But the question is then, like what? Like, and this is the thing, just the duality of the debates that are going on.
