And you may be saying, \"This is an awkward beginning to The Game Over Greggy Show.\" And I agree with you. It is an awkward beginning to The Game Over Greggy Show. I come with terrible news for you ladies and gentlemen. Uh, today Kevin opened up his computer and discovered that he did not have the first five minutes of our show for The Game Over Greggy Show. Now, at which point we said, \"This is an awkward beginning.\" And I agree with you. It is an awkward beginning to The Game Over Greggy Show. I come with terrible news for you ladies and gentlemen. Uh, today Kevin opened up his computer and discovered that he did not have the first five minutes of our show for The Game Over Greggy Show. Now, at which point we said, \"Oh, Kevin, how cute. I'll open up the backup files and get the first five minutes of The Game Over Greggy Show.\" I opened up the backup files. No five minutes. The first five minutes gone. And now you might say, \"You didn't click record.\" We clicked record. The numbered files show that there was a file before this file, but it mysteriously disappeared without any interference from anyone else in the world.

I wish maybe that I wasn't having sex out of wedlock all the time. And this is why he was punishing me like this. But some things can't change, ladies and gentlemen. And we've lost the first five minutes of The Game Over Greg Show. Now you might say no big deal. The first five to seven to 20 to 30 minutes of The Game Over Greg Show every week are just filler. It's just us sitting around talking about mocha lattes and whatever the hell Kevin's mad about this week. But here's what I'll tell you, ladies and gentlemen. This is an especially bad time. Kevin, how many shows we've done? 96. 96. This is the 96th episode. God dang it. We've never had something like this happen before. You say, \"Ah,\"",

One out of 96 times we had to screw up the one time we had somebody who paid to come be on our dumb show. So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show. Jacob Spellman. Yay. Hey, Jacob. How are you doing? Good. How you doing? Good. How mad at me are you? I'm not mad at all. You guys have technical difficulties over there all the time, so it's not a big surprise. Yeah, but that's not an excuse. Like I hate the technical difficulties. I hate that that's an excuse for us that that's one of the reasons and the garbage truck on fire and all that.

I'll tell you right now, there's never been a Game Over Greg show that opened with a guest. That's a one-on-one Skype interview. Yeah. So so luckily, like I said, we only missed the first five minutes of this show. So we just missed the normal rambling trash we talked about. So tell me, what did we talk about? What was our rambling trash? What were we talking about? Uh I think Colin was talking about the word brick and how it hails from the East Coast. You're right. That was the thing cuz it was cold. We were talking about Grimecraft had been on the last show and words that words that had been invented but because he's lit and sus",

And he he says out in the east coast it's cold. It's it's brick. It's it's brick cold out there. Nick was confused because he thought it was just a basketball term which I was in the same boat whereas when you miss a shot you throw up a brick. So exactly that's what I thought too. There's some you know some real deep conversation going on there. Yeah. So that honestly that's pretty that's a 30 second synopsis of everything you people missed out in YouTube and MP3 land. So not that much which is great but I would have gone producer/ seducer Nick Scarpino.

I am not more cultured because I've been to Europe three times and I've been to Japan twice. Sorry, I'm not. I'm much more cultured in the things I've read and the things that I know like than so I think that there's like an unnecessary correlation between those two things that I think makes some people snobby about it. But I think also in the United States I think that we are just isolated from the rest of the world like in Europe you can stumble into another country if you if you if you want to that point though to that point there's if like the population of like Americans that have their their passports and Canadians and Americans it's like 30% or something Canadians is 50% and those folks are everywhere. Like you can't go anywhere without seeing somebody with like the Canadian flag on them and they're they're they're everywhere. Yeah. But no, it's nothing against Canadians.",

I understand that we pay an arm and a leg to live here, but I really do think that there we have some excuses. We are separated by the rest of the world by two huge oceans. We have a humongous geographical country that has desert and tundra and sea co you know beaches beautiful beaches and like we basically I think there's I'm not saying there's nothing we could find overseas that we don't have here. But geographically we pretty much have everything especially if you include Alaska and Hawaii. which I would.

So, it makes sense to me that they would they would travel and all that kind of stuff since they are British in their own way. So, it's um you know, I don't know. I I I just think our culture doesn't necessarily preclude us traveling, but I understand why we don't. And I understand why people around the world judge us for that. But I would encourage people to not judge us based on that. Our culture doesn't necessarily come from just seeing things, but rather like I I know people that I know I I'm not I know people that have been overseas that are the most uncultured **** I've ever met in my life.

And that's something that and that's that's that's sort of my point that we were talking earlier before we did the show was that most of our travels especially together and when we were at IGN had travel were really about around work and so you weren't getting that experience you were going if you were on the video team you were often carrying a ton of gear um that you had to worry about getting through in and out of customs which is",

Um, and so there is that sort of anxiety that comes when you say travel with me where it's okay I have to go do work but what I've never done which is something that my wife has done which is give herself that year to be like just go exist go embed yourself in a different society in a different culture and just see maybe you won't like it maybe it sucks maybe it's completely different but she has such a different perspective on the world than I do and it's not",

I like it. Yeah, I would support the attachment for sure. I know you would, Kevin. I want the attached houses, too.

I'm going to go to South America eventually, but I needed to take a break and come back and just be home and see my family and everything like, and going a year and a half without good Mexican food is the toughest thing I have ever done.

The Heritage Foundation is like kind of a conservative think tank or whatever. They released these stats about the classification of poor in the United States and why that word might not mean what we think it means.

Two-thirds have at least one DVD player and 70% have a VCR. These stats show half have a personal computer and one in seven have two or more computers. More than half of poor families have, and children have video game systems. 43% have internet access. One third have a wide screen plasma or LCD TV. 1/4 have a digital video recorder system to what it means to be poor in the United States. So it is it is all. Yeah. It's totally relative.
