I mean, we can see them if you put them in the freezer, do they become a popsicle? Be bad, um. But anyways, yeah, I'm very thrilled about how this outfit looks, um, I'm very very happy about it. It reminds me of an older time, like a couple years ago back when I was younger, which is weird how that works. But um, I used to dress in high school all the time so I'm happy that I can bring it back for a new generation of good kids, the teens out there, they need to look up to something, I hope it's me.

Cunningham who directed the first Friday the 13th and is the man who owns the license to the franchise he heard about this and he's like well I've been waiting for a game a good game to give the Friday the 13th a license to and he gave it to them, Gun Media, and yeah so now the game they were always implying the franchise they were implying with the game now gets to beat that game that's why they've gone back to Kickstarter because while they were funded sufficiently to make Summer Camp, the requirements you know now with the accuracy recreating Crystal Lake",

So what if you have three people who are all trying to work on getting it? There's a wonderful sense of both teamwork and treachery, and that wonderful sort of tension. You know, really kind of captures I think the spirit of what those movies always wanted to do, which is you feel helpless, you know, against this highly overpowered enemy. And whether or not you sort of have the wherewithal how clever you are to make it through the evening. Mhm.

I think Friday 13th's near and dear to my heart, I actually really love that series, super iconic. I think of it as a Trilogy of iconic horror movies, maybe late 70s like Halloween and then you have A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday The 13th with Jason. He always spoke to me, I always thought that was the creepiest one. What I always talk about is that I loved as a kid and still do - when I look at it, the way that movie looks during the daytime, the juxtaposition of like the trees being green in the blue sky or whatever, and how that seems so beautiful and welcoming, then how harrowing that same scenario is when it's dark.",

And I have watched all of them back to back - that is a fascinating tour through 80's style and value system. Um, know you, you have a bag over your head for two, obviously, you have someone very different in one um, you know then the hockey mask emerges in three but then you have coming back from the dead in six and then I've been underwater getting really rotten from seven through nine.

Like what is what can people expect in terms of like... I mean right now the determination is you know PC, Xbox One, PS4. I think it's fair to assume that retail would be the goal with this.

They are planning to give that level of attention to detail to really serve that fan base, and that just does cost more money. I mean, that's what's exciting though is getting it right. Just hearing you talk about knowing the differences between all the different Jasons and there's different levels obviously for Friday the 13th fans - where there's the people that are like, \"Oh man, I love those movies,\" and whatever, and then there's the guys that are like, \"I love those movies, and this needs to be done right.\"",

It's already pretty scary, that you know you already have that sense that there's something out there because unlike the movies, you know because you're playing the game you know there's something bad out there if you look at the movies you know full awareness that there's someone killing everyone doesn't happen till about the last reel.

I know that Sony's working on Kill Strain now, and we have some other examples of this. Is there is there a concern any sort of concern that without single-player functionality the game will live or die based on the amount of people that play it, and therefore you know like it seems like in other words it seems like people like seem to have more more of a problem with multiplayer games being only multiplayer. Yeah, no, and I I I see what you're saying; the the reason why I feel confident that this would distinguish itself from it is this isn't skill-based in the same way dying in this game should prove just as entertaining as as succeeding.

And yes, as you play the game, you'll have skills that carry over and you'll be able to improve the characters you're playing.

You know, cuz like in video games you instantly kind of have the sense of like I can run fast and jump and do all this crazy stuff, but like how are you guys making or how are they making sure that um the the characters aren't overpowered in a video game sense, but also aren't too underpowered that they can't do anything?

Like, like I'm like this game is so immaculate in so many ways - the presentation, the thought and put into the sequencing of the side quest, the whole side quest wheel I thought was great. Like, to just be able to pop it up and see where you are, and I'm like but then you have all this garbage, like why, like that was like I'm like the game doesn't even need it. And if it had it, it should have just been collectibles that you could find or or if it doled out five or 10 ever so often. I mean, that's I think Rockstar is exquisite at this - where you know you get to a certain point in their games then you get maybe about five missions you can do it whatever order, then you tighten back up into the main story and",

Making the game, you know, what's the better way to play this is and you should kind of nudge the player in that direction. That's a great point because that's what we've had this argument ad nauseam about The Witcher 3 where you do The Witcher 3 side quests too early or too late and you have no experience points with them, and I'm like everyone's like \"you're not playing it right\" I'm like \"what the heck are you talking about?

That's what you learned from The Witcher 3 - you're going to make your next RPG even bigger. Like, it doesn't get any bigger, but just if you would have some more quests, not control.

And so it's not like people have this inherent bias against Nintendo games. It's just that these games are not the Mario games we're looking for - totally get that, especially the one that the system launched with or came out around launch, wherever which was basically just a fact simile of a game that people had already played. You know it was I it was still good though it was still fun and like I'm totally with you; I would never argue that I don't want the Mario Galaxy-like thing or not even Galaxy 3 - I'll definitely want that, but like a new thing you know from the new Big Mario this is what Mario on the Wii U is. You'll get it on NX, I'm sure they were making it for Wii U and I'm sure very early on they were like no no no we can't and like fine I'm down because",
