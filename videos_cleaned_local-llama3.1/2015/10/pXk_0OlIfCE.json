Number one, German developer J\u00f6rg (corrected from \"joerger\") has broken The Silence about losing a major project when publisher Deep Silver took them off of Dead Island 2, a project that was well into development. In a conversation with GamesIndustry International, Jager's managing director Teo Olsson said, \"Having a project canceled in such a late state is a catastrophic event on so many different levels; it really is the worst possible outcome for everybody involved.\" Gamespot points out that Jger Productions, a so-called single-purpose piece of Jager created for the development of Dead Island 2, was shut down entirely once the game was pulled. Olsson said, \"I really don't blame them, and we wish them all the best. I think he's talking about Deep Silver here; yeah, it's tough.\"",

Cancellation of projects especially if the stakes are so high is not unheard of, it hurt us yes but it happens, that's it. Nothing else to really be said about that other than I wanted to share that information. It's interesting that they talked about it. I was going to say I could go for more though - why do they think it got canceled? What were their reasons? Were there miscommunications with the company?

I've never worked on a game; I've never made a game, but I understand what goes into making games very hard, yeah. But at the end of the day, you still kind of take a step back, and you're like, \"No excuses, finish the game,\" yeah. And it's not that easy. And it reminds me of what Aaron Greenberg when he was on the GamesCast last week, who's uh Xbox's marketing manager; it was a great, great podcast gave us a lot of insight; it was a very Xbox-centric uh podcast. And I know this is a PlayStation show, but I bring it up to uh say that he had an argument about Fallout 4 and Tomb Raider coming out on the same day, which I had never thought about. Sometimes you you have to and CU I had I was confident I was like this is all **** up; you could have done something about this. And his argument was no we couldn't have because the week",

In a conversation with IGN actor Alan Tudyk (I'm going to say tutk), who is in a series called Con Man with Nolan North, who was of course Nathan Drake, talked about his own experience working on Uncharted 4. He says this quote: \"I worked on Uncharted - the one that has not come out yet. I was doing a role on that. Really, I hadn't seen Nolan since he and I had recorded years before. I liked it.

I mean, I left because they decided to go a different way with it, and so when they did that, when they changed leadership and made my contract null and void, and I was able to take that opportunity to walk away, which was great because I got the experience of doing it; I made some friends \u2013 not with Naughty Dog, but I made some friends with the people that left. Todd Stashwick was in it, was in that as well, who is in Con Man, and he did the same thing I did, which was yeah, we're going to leave now, y'all are making some weird changes; we're going to leave.

This comes from, of course, Kinda Funny.com/PSQ where you can go leave your questions. This is Silent Storm: The Book. Console Wars describes how the fall of Sega was largely due to Sega of Japan's inability to innovate and capitalize on its American counterparts' success. Do you agree with this? And do you think Sony has the same problems today? I agree with that, yeah. Do I think that?

Because stick with me, DC Universe - I love DC Universe right when they went free to play and then put in microtransactions and put in subscription plans. I continue to play for my subscription plan so that when I want to play it, it's there and I can play it because I understand that to keep the servers running and keep making people content even if it's just the core audience that I'm on the outskirts of right but the people who play and raid every week or whatever if they're doing it",
