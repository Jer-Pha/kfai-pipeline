Yeah, we've been playing it - we've been playing a bit of it to different degrees and stuff, and we have some thoughts about this game. So, the whole thing is: should people be excited for Rock Band 4? Should they buy it? Should they play it? What do... what do we think? I think it's impossible not to be excited for Rock Band 4 if you're someone who somehow missed the movement the first time - it sounds awesome. Get all your friends together and play Rock Band. If you were part of the movement the first time, I think it's cool that it's been off for a while, and now you're back, and it seems like it's exciting to get into it. You know, when it came out the first day we got it, we started playing, and the first thing that struck me was: man, this really is Rock Band - and I mean it in all the good ways... and I mean it in all the bad ways.",

This this I always not to always talk about Lego games but a long time ago if you remember Lego Star Wars 360 put uh online play in right and they never did it again in every game, they got dinged on it and asked questions, and finally they were just like \"nobody played it.\" Like, you can **** like it's a missing feature no one used. I don't know if that's the same thing with...I mean yeah, I don't know. The the stats putting it out there right? Yeah, yeah.

Rock Band is totally a party game and that's great and the people have a lot of fun with it but I think a big issue with it is a lot of the songs just aren't fun on one of the one or more of the instruments people are playing on at",

And I agree with if you put these two games in front of people, especially if you could identify the little visual ticks that make the four more sharp than three, they're indistinguishable from each other. And I've spent an ass amount of time like a lot of you, like you guys and a lot of people out there with Rock Band, um, and I was like okay this is interesting but most people I don't think really care much about tour mode right or anything like that they get in the quick play and that's where I think things fell apart too because I'm like this set list sucks.

And I agree with Greg that saying that well they released all these songs already, like there's a lot of songs that I'm like yeah but that's not really true, like I could stumble across great songs every day that I haven't heard in 10 years. Like you have to start digging and if games, if music was DLC at one point then put it on the disc now. Like what they really should have done is had a set list that's way bigger than 50 songs or whatever it is, and really giving people bang for their buck.

It's just to say like this isn't man, like there's like some catchy stuff on some of those tracks on some of those set lists on on the previous games. And it's a little ridiculous to charge people an arm and a leg for the instruments and then the game and then you have to go buy the actual music you actually want. I'll be really shocked if a lot of people put this game in and are like, \"Oh, I'm very satisfied with the the track yeah.\" And that's something that's like kind of upsetting to me too because I I've always found these games to be music discovery platforms in a lot of way where I listen to the songs, I'm like, \"Oh, now I",

Yeah, and it's weird too that in addition to the old music and downloading it being an issue, I've never had a library of Rock Band songs. So last night, I went in, and I was like, \"**** it, I'm buying a bunch.\" Like, I'm going to have fun with this because I got bored of the three songs I knew from the **** uh set list yeah, and I went to buy them, and it's granted it was like launch.",
