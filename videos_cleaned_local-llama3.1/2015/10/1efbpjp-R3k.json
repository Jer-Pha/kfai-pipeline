I gotta go, but I wanna say, hey everybody, watch him. No, subscribe to UpUpDownDown. We're gonna have a Let's Play where you beat me. Spoilers, he's gonna beat me in it. But not in the game. Get it in your window, but like not. Okay, got it. Okay, oh go, will you wrestle or something? Whatever the hell it is you do. Jeez Louise. What's up everybody, it's me, Greg Miller, from YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames. And I'm here at 2K to play WWE 2K16. I've done a few matches. Xavier Woods, aka Austin Creed from UpUpDownDown, took me to the Woods Shed on his channel. You can go check that out. I don't know when he's gonna put it up. He's a weirdo. I thought I'd jump in and play around for you and do a whole bunch of different stuff because I'm excited, right? For WWE 2K15, great",

You get to jump around in your creations, your online, your MyWWE, your options and stuff. Options, everything you'd expect here, right? Normal stuff, difficulty on, reverse damage, do all this, weight detection's cool, floods. Scarring, I don't know what I'm allowed to show. Just stick with me. What I really like about here is these unlockables. Look at all those people.

What up, Rosemont, Illinois? But you see the whole thing. You got Mr. McMahon, Stephanie McMahon, Paul. I mean, it's all things that I'm stoked to get in here and actually collect, the arenas, championships, the attires. Everything you want in the game. But like I was saying, I felt like there was just more meat on the bone, and from what we're seeing, we're gonna jump around and do a bunch of stuff. So obviously I'm gonna do some one-on-one stuff. Your normal run here. What I'm gonna do, of course, jump to, if you didn't know this about me, I am a huge ECW fan. And I'm talking Paul Heyman, Philadelphia, ECW, Tommy Dreamer, the boys.

You may be, you found me on the internet years ago when I used to do all the wrestling reviews and previews. I definitely have fallen in and out. I played, like I said, 2K15 a little bit last year for streams, and then never really got back to it. So am I gonna win this match? Not necessarily. We need someone, though, to be, I mean, I want Cactus Jack to be ECW champion. But as you go through here, you see some folks who used to be in the ECW, who made their name there.
