            "text": "greetings and salutations welcome back to Kinda Funny Games I'm Colin Moriarty and this is Tim Gettys we had some unfortunate news this past weekend Satoru Iwata, the former president of Nintendo, a longtime Nintendo employee who'd been there and bouncing around different developers including HAL Laboratory for 30 years, uh, he passed away, uh, we figured the best way to celebrate the man because everyone has poignant things to say about him right they're saying all the right things and we appreciate that we how can we contribute to that well let's just celebrate one of his games this is Kirby's Adventure it's a very late NES game came out in 1993 how Laboratory uh put it together and he produced this game so I figured that I figured that we would uh just play through it a little bit and just kind of remember this game and how good it was and of course maybe this is our best way we can sync up with Iwata and pay him our respects yeah it's crazy to think about it man 1993 a new NES game coming out like",

It's one of the last first-party games Nintendo released, up there with Mega Man 6, which they published in the West, and things like Yoshi's Cookie and stuff like that. So, it is a very late NES game. And I also agree with what you're saying that these games are not hard. I don't think they were really designed to be hard at least during this era; they were a little more accessible than the Marios for instance. But there's something authentically special about this game and its creator, Satoru Iwata, and of course, the king is in this game as well. Um, but I really, really do enjoy this game, and um, I feel like even though um you know a lot of stuff's going on, I'm learning a lot about him, and I've known quite a bit about him, but just all the games he touched or worked on.",

You have to have the designers, you have to have more of the design aesthetic with guys like Masahiro Sakurai right, the guys that design the games and create the games, maybe draw the games, you have your animators and your artists, your dot artists, and all those kinds of things. But then you have the guys who really have to make the games run, and not that he didn't have creativity because of course he had a right brain creativity to him as well. But he was the man that really helped these games run, yeah. And uh so a design is great and an idea is great but if you can't make it run then who really cares and he was the guy that was able to do that and that's how he really gained respect first at HAL with games like this and then when he came to Nintendo um and by 2002 he really took over Nintendo a company that was very",

Um, and by 2002, he really took over a Nintendo company that was very different than the Nintendo he came up helping um in any meaningful way. I think that uh that's what's so interesting about his legacy, I think to me is that he showed great brilliance and foresight with uh releases of platforms like the DS and Wii but also saw some struggles and some tribulations with things like the Wii U um and the 3DS early on, but he wrote that 3DS ship. And um a lot of people can't help but wonder um what the company is going to look like without him, and who's going to take over for him? Yeah, I mean there's so many questions, and it's also interesting, but I think my favorite thing of all this is seeing all the PE all the tributes and all the the people with all the different quotes.

Um, like there's that quote from his GDC speech well, like in 2005 or six where he was like, 'You know, on my business card it says I'm a corporate president, but on my business card it doesn't say \"I'm a corporate president,\" it says \"I'm a corporate president\" - no, that's not right. It says \"I'm a corporate president\" in my head, I'm a game developer, but in my heart I'm a gamer.' Right? And it's just like, that's awesome, you know? I agree, and that's what Nintendo, I think, is always engendered, and why I have such respect for Nintendo as game developers. I might not have too much respect for them anymore as a hardware developer, but their games just work - their games are just fun. They have some misses, yeah, but they're still the cream of the crop developer, um, as far as I'm concerned. Their whole team, their whole system of studios and internal games that they create, a lot of variety and stuff like that.

No man, just you know, like, just everybody keeps spreading your positive words about Iwata all your memories and all that stuff because you know it's we his memory will live on forever in games like these, and people are going to be playing these games forever, whether it's Super Smash Bros or Kirby or Pok\u00e9mon or Earthbound or whatever.
