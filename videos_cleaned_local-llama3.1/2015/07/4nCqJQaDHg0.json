She might be wearing it's like a corset of bra built into the thing. Yeah, I was going to say she's, I don't know, fashion. It took me a long time to wrap my head around what's the difference between a skirt and a dress. I mean, it's literally just the length.

See, I'm... I'm not sure about you, but I'm straight-up in detective mode the whole time, pretty much. Um, I find it a little... yeah, yeah. Normally when I'm doing the Predator stuff, I am too, which actually, I like that - I like they introduced that into the game too where there's like at a certain point you'll encounter people that can interrupt that a little bit, which I think is cool. So your strategy has to be kind of identify them and take them down. Yeah, it's weird; I'm not used to having to do it loud - you know what I mean? I'm a quiet guy.
