I named my daughter Ellie when she was born 10 months ago. It was heavily influenced by The Last of Us. I've seen people name their kids weird and frankly stupid names based on books or movies, but Ellie is a real name. The name was cute, but it was really damn judging Ellie and Joel had that really inspired me. I wanted to be a Joel figure to my daughter. I wanted to be a father who would do anything to protect his daughter. Though Ellie isn't Joel's daughter - spoilers, that's pretty known anyway. I wanted to hear your thoughts on this matter, and lastly, the Korean barbecue in Atlanta is still available whenever you guys come back here. Thank you, man. Thank you. I think it's cool. Yeah, I like that. We're to a point where video games can be taken seriously enough, and like you can do that, and not - I mean don't get me wrong.\"",

People think that's weird, there's a difference, they think there's a difference, but you know, like I want my um, I've always wanted to name either for a boy or a girl, my first kid Roosevelt, and um, for Teddy and for FDR, and because we're from New York, and all those kinds of things, just like they are, um, and I love that name, but that's a real, like, they're done, we know everything they did, good and bad, and they're not perfect people, but I have a good vision of what FDR and Teddy Roosevelt did, and it's way more positive than negative, and so I'm inspired enough by their their real-life events, both of them, to name my kid Roosevelt as a first name, and I think that's awesome.

So that's the only point I'm trying to make. I think it's one of those things though that you can do it; you could name your kid Ellie or if we're in the 40s, you could name it Roosevelt and not... for me, it was just like, I, we always talk about how we wanted when we were both remember when we first started IGN, we were like, \"We're so into this,\" and when we're both EIC's of channels, we want to get IGN tattoos right. And I kicked around with that for a long time, and people used to try always say that's a dumb thing, don't do that, what are you talking about? Don't do that.

Yeah, I mean like I don't think that like ruins the kid's name 'cause it was like from this one spot, and then she's growing into her own name. It's not like the name no longer is still only the name as soon as it's given to the child upon birth it becomes theirs and they do what they want with it you know what I mean if that makes sense. Whereas like No Longer is just this you got it from this one point of origin, and then went off. I suppose I I don't know I don't know that I necessarily agree with that because it's it's like you know the 12 Apostles or whatever right, and you're like you're looking through the names but it's like before Jesus was crucified oh I'm going to name my kid Judas sure and then Judas is the one that betrays",

You know because ultimately, you could be setting your kid up for getting teased and just having to carry through this name. You know Kels probably end up being a terrible person at the end of the books if she's not already dead. I don't know, I don't really care at this point.\n\nI corrected \"KES\" to \"Kels\", assuming it was a reference to Kelsie or possibly Kels from a video game or comic book series, given the context of the conversation.",
