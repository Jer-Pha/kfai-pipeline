What are you confident in that you could do better than what's being done with it right now? So for instance, I've criticized I don't know uh Batman: Arkham or Batman: Arkham Knight's tank battles but I don't know what the **** I would do if I I can't do it any better. You know, I mean that's just the reality of the situation. But there's something specifically that I think I can actually do really well and I'm but before I answer, I'm curious what your guys' answer is uh to that question if it makes any sense. It does make sense. I don't I don't have any illusions the uh making me think that I could actually do anything better than what people are doing out there when you get up to the level of you know my brain instantly thinks uh Colin and Greg, let's just go around this.

My answer is a Superman video game. Okay, okay, that makes sense for you. Mega Man, I think, is the clear answer. Where it's like, feel like you understand Mega Man so well that probably better than anyone, like even the people that make that game. Just because it's like you are in love with it and you're in love with everything about it, which I think is what makes it important. You also love playing it, and I think that adds an extra level of like, what do you love about playing it? Not just the creation of it, so you would bring that into whatever you created from it.

But the idea is to get them alive so that you can bring them back to life and reprogram them. I love this so much. So I don't know what this could be. It's not a new show, but we should do like a miniseries or something that's like called... Like how cool would it be? And it's just your Superman thing, you making the Mega Man pitch, like just doing that and just like explain what is the perfect thing you would make if you could. I'd love that, love that. Like describe a perfect trailer for whatever it is. Yeah, what we would want from Fast and Furious 8, cuz like that's Fast and Furious is another thing where I would love for me and you to come up with this story for Fast 8 through 10 go on that right now and wrap it up they got to get",

And it's like seven or eight, and I, I love, I just love that idea of like, then once you get that that origin out of the way by putting Mega Man 2 first, which is so essential to getting people's attention, and then burying Mega Man 1's story in it, which is a story of struggle between two scientists, you know, that were friends, and and one feels like he's being overshadowed, so he just steals his robots. But that Dr. Light still wants those robots back, like in Mega Man 1, he goes and your idea is to destroy them, but Light in my mind wants those robots back; he built them, and they're useful, like Quick Man was made to kill people, but or Flash Man was created to kill people, but you know Cut Man was was used to help, like lumberjacks, like fell Timber.",
