Like, that is a problem with society right now is that we see this thing as like \"Oh, women having sex is bad.\" It's like, no, women having sex is a thing; sex is something that people really enjoy, and it's like, why shouldn't men have that and women don't? Right. And also how are you supposed to get good at it if you don't practice it? What I tell my wife every day. For me personally, I think it's really really important when you're in your 20s to experiment, to have fun, to experience sex as much as you can, and to me that does mean having more than just one partner. Now again if you have someone that you're in love with and you you guys are in a committed relationship, there's nothing wrong with having sex with only one person. To answer your question, Tanya, dude, you know what I mean? And you do those other guys too; yeah, that's what you and whoever you want you are.",
