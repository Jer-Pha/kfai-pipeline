Speaking in an interview with Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, which has been translated by Siliconera, Satomi said he has been discussing strategies to improve the quality of its games with employees: \"I've been talking to employees about how Sega should start putting serious consideration into quality from this point on.\" Which is a bizarre quote, particularly in North America and Europe where it's always been more of a focus on schedules. I believe that if we can't maintain quality, it would be better not to release anything at all, that's one quote, and then he says later um",

Sega in the 90s was known for its brand, but after that we've lost trust and we're left with nothing but reputation; we'd like to win back the trust and become a brand once again.\" um so that's basically the meat of it is that the CEO of Sega, Hajime Satomi, has been the CEO for quite some time actually. I can look into that which is the weird part, yeah he's been... I'm gonna I want to look because it says \"Hajim Satomi was the founder of Sammy Corporation\" so in Sammy and Sega merge presumably that that's when he became um CEO so yeah it's interesting just cuz he's basically saying \"we didn't focus on quality\"",

They kind of then just faded away until it was time for the next Sonic integration with Mario at the Olympics or here's the new Sonic the Hedgehog and it's just like what is happening how is this still going on how are they still being a business? Well I think the thing that's saying about the CEO you're shocked that it's not a new one, is that I feel that the old CEO did the money thing the business thing of just like we're just going to do something that just makes money and like Sonic made money Sonic sold for a long time the quality of",

It never will, but I don't think that makes it helpless in the face of being something that's relevant. And I think that it was relevant for a long time and it wasn't until fairly recently, like the last couple years, that the quality has dipped so low, like with Sonic Boom - that it is just like a disaster.

They should put Sonic away; time thing isn't he the only thing that makes money out of this gaming portfolio? That's the thing, it's like like they need to put them away but at the same time it's like they can't. They just need to fix it, like they need to do something that's going to make Sonic more than anything with Sega. It has to be the quality; we need a quality game that we need a Mario Galaxy for Sonic. I don't know how that could even happen because honestly I don't think it's possible.

So there's that. And I feel like Rocksteady kind of actually simplified it in some ways and made a game that was a little more, I don't know, a little more traditional. But I appreciate what they did, and I think that they nailed the writing, they nailed the ambience. They're a studio that has proven that they can do right by other people's IP, especially in IPs as powerful as Batman. So I'm excited to see what they do.",

Those three games to me are all open-world nonlinear role-playing game-inspired or just straight-up role-playing games with upgrade systems and upgrade trees and skill trees. And Batman's skill tree and Dying Light's skill tree are way better than The Witcher's, I think, in terms of giving you things that are meaningful and that you want to do. Like I've said in The Witcher, um, there are upgrades. I like, I have like 15 upgrade points because I don't even want anything. I'm like, all this stuff sucks; I don't care about any of this. Um, so they're all games that got something right and got something wrong. Um, and I don't necessarily think one is immediately better than the other.

Like for me, that was similar to what you were saying, right? It was uh it for Batman or whatever, like it was traditional by the numbers. That's how I felt about Dying Light, like the gameplay was solid but it was doing the same thing over and over again to get to the next upgrade point, but that's video games in general, so that's never a quality knock.

And I think Dying Light might really be the first one where I was like \"this is really impressive\". Like I remember looking around being like \"this is impressive\", this world is this big, there's no loading, um, the draw distance is perfect, uh, the lighting's great.
