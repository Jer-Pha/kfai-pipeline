And what I was so surprised about with this is that you actually heard of this game. It's a pretty obscure game. This is one of those games that would be like the gift at school that was like, \"Oh, you read your weird anamorphic book for 30 minutes during reading time? Now you get to go play this PC game.\" Then you'd go and play this, and every kid was like, \"You know, there's the one guy I was really good at it.\" I was really good at it, and I beat Chip's Challenge. I've overcome the challenge. And then there was me that was just like, \"I never got that far,\" but I remember playing the hell out of this game. I remember I so I really loved Chip's Challenge as well. Um, and it's funny that you played it in school because I never played it in school. It came with a computer that I got when my mom bought me a Sony Vaio in 1996. Wow, it was $3,200. I'll never",

So I want to play on the d-pad but I can't and go God forbid you know I ever try to figure anything out, no I don't have time for that.
