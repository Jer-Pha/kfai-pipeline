Now granted, I remember very well when Kevin Smith was riding a Superman movie, and I was like this going to be the best thing of all time. And then Tim Burton came over and you know kicked him out, and I was like Tim Burton, I hate him. And then he's like Nicholas Cage; I'm like that sounds stupid. This movie made me believe that Superman lives would have been cool finally. Finally, this has been a thing for so long, long time pictures and all this stuff. I remember when the first picture of Nicholas Cage came out in the super they everyone's like flipping their lids, so this is cool to see it finally here. I love Blu-ray supporting the physical media. Thanks Greg; you know that I hate it, and you know that I wouldn't have it, but my thing was I wanted to be able to watch it as soon as I could, and he couldn't have autographed a digital copy.",

They're punching; they're doing a battering ram. I'm like, \"Yeah, that looks awesome.\" Go preview night doors open go to the Funko Pop lines, CA, get the hell out of here. Next day I go there, they're like, \"Lion, CA,\" we don't have any more for the day.

This one I ran into on the floor and when I say I ran into it, my lovely girlfriend Christine at SDCC saw it and she said I needed to buy it now. I usually don't wear gray shirts; she said this one's okay. But I feel like they give me the titties, like this one gives me the titties. But it's a Superman shirt, so I wear it. I usually like it when... granted my fat body gives me the titties. Thanks, Nick, punching on my titties. See what I mean? Like you just get this definition and in the black shirts you don't see that as much but with colors you do. So that's why Greg Miller generally doesn't wear them, but he puts it aside for Superman because he loves Superman. What I bought was this Japanese PlayStation shirt.",

These comic books are like we're going to end everything that you guys like. Well, no, it's I mean the new 52 pretty much recovered. But anyways, they came back and now Superman wears jeans in a t-shirt when he fights, and this is his new logo on the T-shirt he wears. And so I like that logo, and I... I like what they're doing. He's depowered, he's you know having to learn and eat food again and do all this different stuff. It's like, \"all right cool, eat that - what food?\" That's your big fight.

I go over there; I ask the guy for it. When I bought these other two shirts, he says, \"Sure, no problem,\" gives it to me. I buy it. Two days go by, and I'm packing up to go home, and I notice... No, he gave me another Batman Beyond shirt. Now, luckily, one of my favorite shirts is my Batman Beyond shirt from Graffiti Designs, and that's breaking down as well. Okay, cool; so you're good then? This is such a cool shirt. Yeah, well, you know who liked it a lot yesterday? Batman Beyond himself. What's Eric Matthews going to say? Will Ferrell was here; I hosted a panel with Will Ferrell. I was wearing my broke-down Batman Beyond shirt, and he's like, \"I like that shirt.\" We took a photo together, and... Broke-ass Batman, Roger Craig Smith, ruined it. Let me.",

I'm standing here, we're backstage before this panel, and all of a sudden, Wolf Rell walks by, and I'm like silently freaking out to myself on the inside. And he walks up to Greg, super stoked to see him in the shirt, and they had this conversation, and then just walked away. And I was like, \"Greg, they're friends. I didn't even know that.\" And later I talked to Greg; he's like, \"No, we're not friends. You just like my shirt.\" But it's like, wow, that's the power of friendship now we're friends. He follows me on Twitter, that's amazing. Everybody tweet at him and tell him to come on Kinda Funny. So anyways, most people would be mad and return the Batman Beyond shirt to get a new one.
