Yeah, I would say all right cool, John Ullrich. It's a long one. Shu spoke about not being a fan of annualized series at DICE 2015; however, there's no denying that companies like Activision and Ubisoft make a lot of money doing so, e.g., Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed. Despite being money makers, the rush to make yearly deadlines and corporate obligations brings into question the quality because of bugs as we've seen with Assassin's Creed Unity or a perceived lack of innovation or stale gameplay and story from previous editions like Call of Duty: Ghosts. Are there any series that you envision being on the cusp of annualization? Which beloved series of games would you love to see annualized, with the caveat that its normally extremely high standards may take a hit in order to reach the yearly quota for example instead of 9 to 10 scores every three",

You can't - I don't think you can pull that off again and do it. Mhm, I mean it's interesting because I feel like we're in a Renaissance of the annualization thing; it's a very different type now, it's way more important. But back in like even the PS2 era, there were so many games that they were annualized - like Madden and stuff like that, like Tony Hawk, Need for Speed. Like these games just happened every year, you know? Um, and then eventually that kind of style died out for a bit, and then it did come back with Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed, Guitar Hero, and like... oh yeah, exactly, Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and all that. So I don't know - do you have any good examples? No, I mean where my mind went in terms of recent is Assassin's Creed; I don't see anything jumping aboard that because I don't think that the model",

What Rockstar saw was like this is the way we should be doing things: making big, meaty games that we can stand behind; we invest a lot of money upfront, we get a lot of money behind it, and then we get a lot of money back afterwards. Plus, we make really meaty DLC, which they did with The Ballad of Gay Tony and the Lost and Damned, which were great pieces of DLC. They do this for five years; I think they will. I think that they're just focusing more on GTA V, but then they just went quiet again. And then they came back and they made all their money back in one day from the development of Grand Theft Auto V, plus hundreds of millions of dollars presumably in profit in a very short amount of time. And that probably raises the bells that Activision was ringing, being like we don't have to support all these studios; Rockstar",

And so I think what we're seeing is not necessarily a renaissance of annualization but the exact opposite, which is the reconsidering of annualization that has happened for probably the last 10 years or so, and a way that they can pull back the reins a little bit and be like we can be smarter with our money by investing more in the front and getting more in the back because this is more of an event.

Well, Brotherhood wasn't really an Assassin's Creed game; I'm like, well, it was an Assassin's Creed game, you know. Um, what would have Assassin's Creed looked like if there were only four of them and they were **** awesome, you know? People stopped and focused, and let's see what we can do with this push the boundaries exactly. And like I think Ubisoft, yeah, they make money, and and they they appreciate their candor and saying like we make these games every year because the market demands them every year, and that's true.

In other words, are you going to make a platform - we often talk about it with Gran Turismo, which I think would be a game as a platform. And I think we're going to see that. Um, and he was like... that is the you know, I'm paraphrasing, but he basically said in the interview: like that is kind of what we think is going to happen. And so I think the annualization thing is collapsing. I don't think you're going to see it; it's not like it's an earthquake that's going to bring it all crumbling down now.

You know, they did that with New Vegas, and New Vegas was a game that took two years or three years, I guess, to make, and it was awesome, and then they just disappeared. You have to kind of hit and run like that to treat your IP with care. I think Ubisoft is certainly bending the curve towards Activision in a way that makes me a little bit uncomfortable because I still think that they're one of the most real regular AAA publishers out there. I think you can learn a great deal by using their more judicious use of IP, uh, like Microsoft with Halo or Gears. It's a dangerous game to play to oversaturate and annualize things.",

We'll see that, yeah, I mean for me, I mean like, just to rattle off things of course Patapon for me because I'm just playing that for the fun so do that right, so Patapon, uh, I would think about Shovel Knight as a recent example, Hotline Miami, Rogue Legacy. I would love a Rogue Legacy every year, you know what I mean with a new dungeon, New Castle to go down and take everything down and do stuff like that, like those games where it's like, I don't give a flying **** about the story, I'm just here to play and have fun playing that's what I want, just give me that, yeah, cheap games.",

And and I think that this is a conundrum that needs to be overcome by some Brave publisher. And I still think that the publisher that can do it and and I think might do it first is EA - because I think they have to do the math to say like we don't really need all of these Studios making these games every year, we can take EA Canada to have them spend three years on a beautiful hockey game that we can then support after that.
