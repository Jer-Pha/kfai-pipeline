The game is from a Polish studio called The Astronauts, uh the head of that studio is a really experienced indie dev uh or just developer rather his studio now is indie he worked on Bulletstorm and a few other games um but I've been really excited to try this game for a while it came out on PC uh in 2014 um it is now available on PlayStation 4 presumably it will be available on Xbox One and other consoles and other places soon uh but who the hell really knows but uh I've been meaning to play for a while I'm glad to finally have the opportunity to do it and we're just going to see what happens.

I think you use L1 or no, L2 to look. Okay, that's basically it, and then you use the sticks to control, obviously. That's it; you're not like fighting anyone or shooting anything, don't think so. So let's head back to we'll run back over here to the train track, that the tunnel we came from is right there. We'll see if there's anything else around here. Vent as we move through the game. It looks pretty; it is very pretty. I like the smoky haze of it. You know what I mean? I know exactly what you mean. I know exactly what you're saying. So there's a path here, the sun is over here.

He didn't need to worry; I'd worked dozens of cases, hundreds this would be my last. Alright, now dozens and hundreds of cases are two different things. How experienced are you? Cuz if you've done dozens of cases, you're pretty experienced. Hundreds of cases, it's time to retire. Yeah, you probably shouldn't even be alive at this point. Enter, get in that. All right, forward back yeah go forward; let's clear that. Let's clear that uh no nothing happens. Turn on did you turn it?

Oh yeah, I can tell you're already sucked in; I can tell 'cause eventually you're going to come to a town and think about all the things you can look at in the town - it's like Twin Peaks, it's exactly like Twin Peaks. Let's go this way; I'm intrigued. Are you intrigued? Are you? Can I describe you as being intrigued right now or not? I'm intrigued that you're intrigued.
