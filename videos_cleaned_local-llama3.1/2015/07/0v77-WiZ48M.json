Cuz when there are so many bronzes then there's fewer room for the gold and the silvers, of course. Um there is an enormous amount of trophies in that game, yeah. Um CU that's why I was surprised when you're like I only have 30% of the trophies. I'm like how is that possible? Yeah but I've been playing, I have I think 18 trophies and it's only like 21% or something like that. I'm like all right last night I was driving the Batmobile around when us running up these final Ridler trophies slid off of a like overpass fell down on two wheels and a trophy popped.

You assume that cuz Caitlyn Jenner is a man was a man and wants to be and feels a woman becomes a woman that he is therefore gay but he says that he's not nope you know. So like then the layers like get deeper and deeper like he's always been attracted to women, he just feels like a woman so like there's the it takes education and learning and you're going to make mistakes and that needs to be acceptable.",

Frankly, I'll be right in your corner; I'll say that's totally wrong because that infringes on your religious rights just as your feeling of thinking that your religious doctrine can affect the rights of a homosexual who might not believe in your religion, who might be an atheist, who might be of a different religion, or who just doesn't give a **** and just wants to get married. They're not interested in banging your Church door down and getting married in your church. And if that doesn't happen - and that's not going to happen - then uh, then it it's it's a live and let live Society.

Because especially if you're growing up as a teenager, like how would you you would see senators or people running for president talking about God, and you would assume that those two are intrinsically tied together, and they are not, and they should not be, but they kind of are right. That's where... and that's where that comes in. The other problem is, and the other question is, you know, a lot of gay people are Catholic, like yeah, no man, so what do you do there?

I mean, I guess this is the thing, this is and this is where things get muddy, and and I respect that. This is going to be a bit of a mess for some companies because the Civil Rights Act of 1964 says you can't do that.
