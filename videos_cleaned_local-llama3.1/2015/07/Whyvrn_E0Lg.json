Starting yeah okay, I want to continue. We just have to be judicious with the time that's all. I'm going to hit it now. Yeah, hit it now. Go there. It's going. Everybody. First of all, I just want to say that I love the premise of this game movie - it's a great idea. Dumb kids being dumb, I love dumb kids, and I like the idea that there'll be so much to replay. Mhm. When you see a butterfly pop up on screen, that means that was one of the decisions that could have taken the story down, you know? Hallway A or hallway B. And I got to be honest, I kind of forget that this game exists sometimes. Not because I'm not excited about it - cuz I'm clearly I mean I've been excited.",

It's that girl from Walking Dead Season 2; she grew up to be Sarah. Mike, it's Hannah, hey Hannah, what's up babe? Oh, here comes some choice ammo. This is just a preview, I assume we're just being dropped into the middle of nowhere. Seems like it's the beginning of the game, yeah, but I mean like when if there there's a title scroll and like we're driving to... must be us this weekend. My assumption that this is like an alpha build of the entire game; I'm mean control a hat girl in yoga pants, hats now. Colin, you've asked me before what a basic chick is, yeah it's this - the ug boots. Ug boots? They don't look like Ugg boots to me though they're not Uggs.

Um, and that took like you know a lot of playthroughs of the game. Will you do it? Will you play Heavy Rain again on PlayStation 4? No, I don't think I will either. I'm definitely not going to play Beyond: Two Souls again. No, oh God, now I didn't even finish Beyond: Two Souls the first time. Oh, you did here's our Miss yeah no God it was sucked.
