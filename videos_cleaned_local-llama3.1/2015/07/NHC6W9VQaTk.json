Leave all of your things... Okay, he wants us to talk about why Fallout 4 didn't get mentioned at all for Game of the Show. Now, a lot of people were tweeting me about this because I left it a little nebulous - we'll discuss this next time. We don't like Fallout 4; we love Bethesda; we hate Todd (no, we love Todd).

Whereas Fallout jumped all around and showed us different slices of it which is great and awesome but Uncharted showed me something that was this Horizon you know kills on kill on Horizon kill Horizon, J Christ basically gorillas Horizon you know showed us a giant chunk of the game and this is how it's going to play and this is it moment to moment. I guess it's a shitty answer but I mean we're not journalists or whatever or critics, critics I guess but you know it was excitement, I was excited about these games Fallout like I went and got my Pip-Boy Edition as soon as I could you",

That's the way I feel about it too.

Mario Maker, we've known about it for years at this point and I've always been like, it's going to be cool, it's going to be fine, but then seeing what they did at the Nintendo World Championships, I'm like, man, this game is gonna be awesome, and they turned something that was like 'oh yeah, it'll be fine' too, I need this game now. Yeah, you know? So that's why I got that for me, and then Horizon was the game that came out that was like, this looks great, and we didn't even know about it.

But it wasn't a surprise, and it wasn't like there was nothing about it that people were like, \"I can't believe they did that.\" It was all, \"This is exactly what I want.\" Fallout 4 is similar to me in the same boat as Metal Gear Solid, where Metal Gear Solid I already know is on my short list for Game of the Year, and I imagine Fallout 4 will be as well. And I imagine Fallout 4 is going to win, so it's like they're not the underdog - you know what I mean? Uncharted, I was like, okay, more Uncharted. I liked more Uncharted.

Well, I mean it's it's crazy to look at someone like Phil Spencer who is an Xbox guy, he's an Xbox and he still is when it comes to Destiny - like he plays his Xbox version is his main one but he has a PS4 character that he cares about and like that's crazy to me.

Um, my my my assumption is that Activision, I mean all the publishers get in bed with the first parties, but I feel like Activision does it strategically in a way where they actually make money on E3, and I think that's that's a thing where you know that's just a Bobby Kotick bit of their business, you know? Yeah. So I think when they appear at Sony's conference, Sony's probably paying them, you know, and so they don't have to worry about anything else. I think that to them they're like well we'll show our games um where it makes sense and we don't need to show everything, and then you don't have redundancies like Ubisoft and EA does, and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that Activision is just really way bigger, so um it's weird though it's like Activision doesn't want to make money, you know?
