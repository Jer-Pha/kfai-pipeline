I originally came up with a long list of candidates, but Igarashi and Aon's inability to fully fund Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night through traditional routes has me rethinking things at this point; it would just be Kojima, and not that he would ever leave Konami.

Like he's going to come out of this a folk hero, you know? I mean people would throw money at him. Sure, but I think that we overestimate how big Kickstarter is for cash and for getting money through that.

But it's more that he is one of the few names that I think, because of his situation with Konami right now, there are publishers that would die to get him on board. So I don't you know like like he's not making something obscure - Metal Gear Solid is still a pretty obscure game and Bloodstained is a 2.5D Metroidvania game; it's just it's not big-budget games like he makes, big cinematic games that you can't make for seven or ten million.

Um, and PS2 could have had me probably more. I expected the PS2 to have me have its hooks in me a little bit more than it did, considering how poor that launch lineup wasn't. It was it was they launched it on hype, and in fact, it was a DVD player; it didn't matter. It was very similar to the PS4 where it didn't seem like it mattered, yeah.
