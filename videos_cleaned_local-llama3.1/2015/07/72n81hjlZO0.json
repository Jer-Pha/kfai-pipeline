I feel like director's cut because this looks more like a Disney princess game, uh, which is right up his alley. It is right up his alley, but you know what? He's not here, so F him. I mean he's in the other room, F him. He's in the other room otherwise he can go and F himself with his perfect little effing hair and that tight little effing thighs of hits he has tight tight thighs, I know that, Jesus, they're tight. Um, so Nick, to catch you up, there's a few things you should know about this game. I haven't played this one yet, so this is uh Risky's Revenge, that originally came to DSi, is that why it's in 4-3 with exactly back in like 2010 and then it was TR, you know? So it came to PC um last year, I think, and now it's coming it's on PS4 playing on PS4 right now. Oh God, so uh the reason that I wanted to play",
