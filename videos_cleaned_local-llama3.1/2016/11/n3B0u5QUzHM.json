If you live in a cold weather environment, imagine what they put up right around is - they're transitioning into winter, but they're not there yet, but they still want to stay so there are heat lamps in this place and you can just see through and you can see just the parade of insanity that walks by on any Thursday to Saturday night on the marina and it's fantastic, insanely good-looking people. Um, but as the night goes on it goes from that to just trash right and uh we were there, we're all having a good time, big group of people, and then all of a sudden Kevin is just like uh who parked his beautiful Ford Ranger truck uh right in front so we can look at it um and he's just like oh God\"",

It was my friends - oh god - they were at a concert, and one of the girls was sitting on a lawn chair; one of her friends was wearing a romper, and she decided to just kind of scoot, scoot her butt to the edge of the romper, pull that romper to the side or to the edge of the chair, pull that romper to the side, and just start splashing away. Greg just looks at her, and she's just kind of sitting there, and just lets it happen, and it's just like, \"Huh, huh, that seems I'm not okay with this; that seems a bridge too far.\" Because you don't pee where you eat or pee where you're watching, I imagine Bruce would just",

Oh, you're nailing it well, okay, you know, and I'm just like, well, this is horrible, like now it's going to smell like dig a little hole for it first or is it just no, no, she's scooting the old scoot. So did they move Arthur or no, they just stayed there, and it was one of those things where so Gia didn't bring it up, like they made eye contact, they had their moment but like they were in a bigger group. I mean, I'm sure okay, Okay, G is involved, yes, they were drunk, are they at school? No, drunk there you go, yeah, exactly, uh, so I don't know, but I just like this situation it kind of bothers me just because I'm like well I'm so what are we talking about now your two stories where it seems like it's bothering you are females peeing you got a problem",

I know well, hey this is a hypothetical situation still feel like in this scenario where you're that close to public people like I just think that's not cool. I just don't think it's acceptable at all. Like and I've done it. I'm not not proud of it sometimes you have to do it but like I was walking around my neighborhood the other night, I think it was Saturday night, and this is Halloween weekend right so a lot of crazy people out in my neighborhood having fun um but I think I went out at like 7:30 or 8:00 like right when it got dark um and not like a block away from where I was there was just a dude looking at his friend and his friend was just chilling peeing and it was an all empty block with one car and he was peeing right.",

I'm like you; we're getting you went a half a block down, and then decided that that was a good spot to pee. But like, I don't know; I'm like you got to be a little bit more savvy about that. Like both of these examples from the marina are just the Marina kids being the Marina kids; it's the same thing. If I went to like a Missoula tailgate or whatever, and I was walking by the Anheuser-Busch people, and they're peeing in the bushes and trees, I'd be like, \"I you know, I've been there; I understand.\" Oddly enough, I feel fine about bushes.",

If you're in an alleyway in like downtown Manhattan surrounded by garbage cans and rats, there's no one there. The last call in Manhattan is absurd; in New York City, it's absurd. So you know people rolling out at one or two to even go out right there's no one around, even in the middle of the world basically, which is what New York City is. And a cop suddenly just comes upon you because you're peeing in an alleyway in the middle of no one like you're not even really committing a crime of any consequence that's the thing I'm saying you're peeing it stinks it's not a crime of consequence though I well what what is a crime of consequence murder okay fine I guess I guess you're right breaking and entering what is a crime of consequence almost anything else that you can get a ticket for so so to me like I I just feel like you know",
