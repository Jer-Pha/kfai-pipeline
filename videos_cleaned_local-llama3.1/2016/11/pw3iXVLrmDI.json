And this is when I realized something: My mother views video games as some childish meaningless habit or addiction, as she likes to call it, now that has no purpose other than mindless entertainment, of course. I'm embellishing; my mother didn't actually say those things. Therefore, I tried to persuade her to see that video games were more than that and had more meaning to me - but they're my passion in an art form that needs due respect. Being a Cinema Studies major with the hopes of pursuing screenwriting in my future, I understand the meaning of storytelling on all platforms. But how do you describe the importance and meaning of video games to someone or even further a society that views video games and gamers as a wasted opportunity - growing less important staring at a TV screen?

To this extent, I'm not exactly sure what I'm trying to get at; I'm sure there's some deeper conversation hiding away in here somewhere. All this just sprung to mind during driving back from the hospital as the anesthesia was wearing off and I was trying to convince my mother that no matter how much pain I'm in, no matter how many times little bastard girls backhanded me, I will play video games until my wrist falls off.

It's not even so much about playing them, but about living them and thinking back on all the memories of my life. In no small way, I am who I am because of video games - my career, my job, all that. Obviously. But when I stop and think back on my life, and I think back about the friendships that I made and the relationships that I have, so many of them are birthed in video games in some way. Whether it's the hours of Co-op we played together or just waiting in line for the new Halo game to come out in front of a store, or just talking to your friends about what Mario 5 could look like - you know what I mean?

But yeah, I mean, uh, picking up on your point - like this is the wave of the future, and it's not so much even the future anymore; it's the now. This is happening; this is how things are. And I think that it won't be long till video games are just something people just do.

Oh really, which would be totally **** do yeah, that's really cool. Uh, I mean this isn't so much answering your questions as much as providing example of something that did this and it worked with uh Tomb Raider, I I forget the name of it but \"Guardian of Light\" - Guardian of Light. I feel like that was more of an isometric thing and I feel like it really kind of uh went to the heart of what Tomb Raider meant to you playing it growing up. Like Tomb Raider, I I honestly feel doesn't hold up when you go back and play Tomb Raider 1 through three nowadays even though back then it was so amazing. Um but this game kind of like made it feel like I remember Tomb Raider.
