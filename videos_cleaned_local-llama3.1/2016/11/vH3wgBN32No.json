Liv Tyler is a main caller from the political landscape. What do you see happening with the nuclear bomb? I think it will be used again. I don't, I don't so. The nuclear bomb has not been used since the year that it was finished have been tested that way. Yeah, they've been tested thousands of times. Yeah, but in combat they've only been used twice, both by the United States, and that you know we've talked about in the past. I'm of the mind that we did the right thing. I know that that's a controversial thing. It's not, it's actually becoming way less controversial over time, and there's a lot of scholarship that supports that specifically if you read about Operation Downfall which was the operation to take over to invade Japan in late 1945 in 1946 which we anticipated we didn't lose at least",

So in that particular situation I think that they were used in a righteous way, but we also didn't really know, you know, we didn't start that war, we tried to end it, we asked for surrender, and etc., and so on. And there are arguments that we could have dropped at over Tokyo Bay or something, I mean like just look what we have, but we didn't think that that would work, and there's also some geopolitical reasons why we probably did it to scare the Russians who were in it would agree that Yalta to invade Japan from the north and stuff. So this complicated things about why the bomb was used and it's also complicated why",

The closest we've gotten to the bomb being used since then was 1962, when the Soviets almost bombed us during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and that was amidst other things like the Cuban embargo. And all this guy - I mean, there was a lot of fallout, no pun intended, because of that. But I'm not sure that we've gotten terribly close since then to using it. But I do think that it'll be used again, like in Korea. As far as state actors are concerned, North Korea is the obvious choice, and I think this is what makes it so complicated - they first of all have homegrown fissile material, and they might have bought the technology from other countries that have it.",

They might have bought the technology from other countries that have that have you know the technology to do these things. We don't really know where I'm sure the CIA does and the South Koreans do but I hope they have bombs. The bombs aren't impressive, they have no delivery system of any consequence to deliver them here, but they can certainly deliver them easily to Seoul, they can deliver to Tokyo and etc if they wanted to. My assumption is that the country teeters North Korea people have said for years, I mean I read a lot about North Korea it's like one of the things almost fascinating but I read almost every book that comes out about North Korea because I'm just so interested in it and for decades people been like they're gonna collapse they're gonna collapse they're gonna collapse and what's clear is that they're probably not gonna collapse anytime soon and if that if it's",

And if it is collapsing from an outside force, well they have these nuclear weapons, and so they're likely to use them. I think they'll use them with small yield, like 10-15 Megaton bombs, but that can level a city - yeah, that's the same power of a bomb that we dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So and the Nagasaki bomb wasn't nearly as devastating as it should have been because it fell in a valley... wait could've been way worse. So I think as far as state actors, I think North Korea is probably only one liable to use one. But I actually think a nuclear bomb will be used by a terrorist organization - whether it's in the form of sort of dirty nuclear bomb or a straight nuclear bomb or something like that.

The fact of the matter is there's all this material floating in the ether for 65 years, and we definitely - no matter what anyone says - we have no idea where all that is. No way you know we use any material? What are you gonna name your uranium and all the yeah which you know you have to it's complicated to you know if you go to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, or read about Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that a lot of the work for the bomb was done there, and it took years simply because they had to figure out how to extract the stuff and make it so that it was you know able to be detonated in a bomb. And we have two different types of bombs - Little Boy and Fat Man were two different kinds of bombs that worked in different ways; one was plutonium or uranium, I think, but it's not easy to do that in the forties.

I don't recall Anya Latoya Libya, oh yeah, the Libyans. The Trinitite so you know the bomb was so complicated to make that the Soviet bomb that was detonated I think in '49 was a complete copy of our bomb because they infiltrated the nuclear program and stole it - like stole the plan for the state. A facsimile of our bomb, I mean that was the quickest way for them to get there, and it still took them five years to make it. So the reason I say that is because all of these materials at the height of it 60s and 70s and into the 80s we were talking about tens of thousands of bombs that we both sides had - the Soviets and the Americans. And if you look at the graphs, we're down really low, we're down to like a late 50s era or mid 50s era out of bombs. We don't have that many anymore did we?

And that's where tactical nuclear weapons come in, with low yield, few megatons, where you're basically using them on soldiers and stuff like that. There's really no practical reason to use them on tanks and planes and some like that anymore. The interesting thing is that nuclear war used to be the flashpoint, but now it's the use of a nuclear bomb that is the flashpoint. So there are all these little flashpoints around - a flash point is just exactly this: mom flash pointer - like things where we think bad things can happen based on one act. And so you have Iran, you have Western Ukraine, you have the Russians in Ukraine, you have North Korea, you have all these little things. And I do think that the only one that's the Russians in Ukraine could have an exchange of nuclear bombs - it just isn't gonna happen; it will destroy the world, you know",

Pat Frank's \"Alas, Babylon\" is really good and yes so there's a good fiction about it hopefully it stays in the realm of fiction nuclear bombs are very serious but I'll reiterate again that nuclear power can go awry like intra-nuclear but I also think that it's it's the nuclear power as the answer to our power problems as well we just have to become comfortable with it again to segment the twentieth century knowledge of the bomb to the 21st century use of nuclear power like the Sun which is a nuclear furnace so yeah so I hope that answers Nick's question I wasn't exactly prepared for it but I think it's an interesting thing",

Definitely the Nagasaki bombing was worse. I'm not sure because Nagasaki was near the ocean and the bomb missed its target, which was a low-angle drop over a valley that shielded a lot of the city from the blast. That was like I said, were you saying that Nagasaki wasn't the first target? No, the target they wanted was Kyoto. General MacArthur, I think, was one of them who wanted to drop it on Kyoto.

You know, we would have lost something like 10 to 15 times more people than we did in that invasion; we lost in the entire war, yeah. So you have to think about those things when you weigh the use of the bomb. I think it's a terrible thing; I don't think it should ever be used again. I don't think we should be proud of using it, but we did save millions of Americans and millions of Japanese lives. You know, there are people walking around Japan today \u2013 millions of people walk around Japan today whose parents or grandparents would have been killed by American soldiers.
