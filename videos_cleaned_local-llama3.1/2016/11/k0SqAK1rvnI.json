Yeah definitely but I I hate those **** characters already, I just hate them, I hate the boy band like I just hate those Char. And I was surprised to see like our friend Vince wrote a review, I read a little bit of saying like the characters were some of the redeeming qualities of the game.

You and I we aren't multiplayer kind of guys, but this going out and getting bounties and stuff, like there's this one mode where you have to be the guy who takes out five people in the Bounty Hunter mode, you have to take out five because there's a time where you have to be the bad guy and take out a guy coming",

I'm telling you so that you understand that my experience might not be normal with the games in terms of difficulty and especially in terms of game time.

I don't know if they lied; they intended to do something, but their intentions weren't seen through in the game. That's not uncommon \u2013 you always hear about how sequels often realize what the game's supposed to be, and most of what's supposed to be in the game gets cut out. We know a lot of developers; we know how that goes. But they really did screw this game up, but I don't know if it was just them. If this was an indie game for $40 at a similar price point with very little exposure or less exposure, with less promises made and less lead time, this is a great example of a game that needed to go away for a long time instead of being shown over and over again.

Um, I hope we hear about it. I think they'll show something for Kingdom Hearts 3. I think it's more likely to see Final Fantasy VII because it's sooner.

It was right on the heels of Advent Children coming out, and for all the flaws the movie had, the action was awesome, and the fight scenes and stuff were cool. I'm like, man, imagine a Final Fantasy one day actually having fights like that. And then seeing the trailer for Versus XIII, the tone was so different, the music was amazing - with music done by Nobuo Uematsu, the person who does the Kingdom Hearts music, it's fantastic. Um, I was like, this is different and this is cool. It looks more action-focused, and like I am so down. It looks like Kingdom Hearts but with a real story, so I was stoked for that.

Colin, you know we like to take trophy time questions here and there today. I'm gonna give you a trophy time success story. This comes from the PSN name Jack m304. Hey guys, I just got my 50th platinum trophy. It wasn't in a new game or even a game I hold dear to me; it was in Dying Light. In case the best friends don't know, Techland is notorious for releasing games with broken trophy lists, and Dying Light was no exception when the game released in 2015. I got all the trophies except for the side quest one. I did all 52 side quests at least three times, not including my most recent playthrough, and the trophy still didn't pop. I put away the game in defeat thinking I'd never go back for the platinum, and that was rightfully mine. Patches eventually fixed the list, and as I neared this trophy milestone, I decided to conquer the game that stole a platinum from me.",

Let's be honest, it's not really because these games were bad - just that they were drowned in a release window that consists of other major shooter games. So question one: do you think with the given sales of these games Sony should keep doing what they're currently doing (which is release their exclusives throughout the year and support the third-party games that have always released in the fall anyway, Call of Duty, Ubisoft action adventure etc.)? Question two: do you think more game publishers will move their games out of the Fall lineup given the sales of these three excellent AAA games?

And um, video games might be a viable way for you to be able to do that. But definitely don't, you know I believe in escapism in a sense, but I also don't believe in it as the end all solution to a problem that's still going to exist when you get back whether you're waking up from a hangover or whether you're getting out of a video game, it's all the same.

Everyone agrees on that, but I'm glad you feel that way. The thing with Heavenly Sword is that Ninja Theory had uh was ready to do the sequel and I think they were in some sort of pre-pro or they had everything written up. I think Hellblade is somewhat of a spiritual successor to it - might be the same um. I was surprised that Heavenly Sword didn't get a sequel specifically because when it came out in 2007, it was really the first PS3 exclusive of any note for me except for Resistance.
