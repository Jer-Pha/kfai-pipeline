Single player campaigns and multiplayer for a lot of people out there. And even you guys are talking about Titanfall not necessarily being your guys' cup of tea, but it's like people seem to be really enjoying the Titanfall is a good game. Titanfall is even a great game, but it's just not as good as people are saying it, which is why we keep getting hung up on it. That's great. So from I'm almost done with the Battlefield One or Yeah, Battlefield 1 campaign and it's fantastic. Hearing nothing but good things about the Call of Duty campaign. It's very good. So Colin, that's what I want to talk about. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare.\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n- \"Kevin\" (not provided in metadata) \u2192 assumed to be a mistake for Tim Gettys, so changed to \"Tim\"\n- No other changes were made as they would alter the original meaning or grammar.",

I was watching waiting for the results to come in. Obviously, this happens a little bit earlier in California because of the timing. So, I had woken up. I was going through email doing a little bit of work and then I was like, you know, I'm just going to pop this in. Uh I I had installed it and um so I I put about 3 hours into it or so. Um so, not enough time to have a co, you know, a comprehensive review of the game yet, but playing on veteran as well.

It's about uh Earth basically um humans leaving Earth and kind of uh exploring the solar system similar to Mass Effect. Um but in this respect they're searching for uh goods uh or uh precious minerals, whatever gases that they need to survive. The earth is just too um swamped with with people. There's not enough uh there for everyone. So what ends up happening is that they go to places like Europa. They go to they really go to like all the planets, all the system, all the like the um the planet the planets and uh there's a rogue part of this group that basically splinters off um and wants nothing to do with Earth anymore and basically is like this spaceorn",

Um and uh although they're not using AI, they're basically doing it overtly um with uh attacks. And uh I like the so I like the way it starts. I like the what it's all about. I think it's a very interesting game um from a plot perspective. I think in this respect it destroys Titanfall. Um and and I I think Greg might agree like Titanfall 2's story um I wasn't playing it for the story. In fact, I didn't care about any of the characters. I didn't care about what was happening. we discussed on PS I Love You that uh Titanfall 2 had this very peculiar thing it was doing where it would introduce",

Um, I think that, you know, I I don't know how Greg feels about this, but I think that Titanfall 2 goes too far into parkour. Um, I think that parkour and and kind of sudden movements and platforming in first person is difficult. And I and not necessarily in terms of mechanics, but in terms of just understanding you you don't have the proper perspective to know where you are and I don't think the games work like that. And so Infinite Warfare takes some of what Titanfall does, but not all of it. It is 25% of that um as opposed to Titanfall is kind of more willy-nilly fast movement. And so double jumping and stuff like that feels good in the game, but I don't have to",

Um there are different kinds of enemies. The game feels a lot actually like uh Titanfall in some ways in terms of the enemy variety that you're receiving that you're kind of dealing with and all this.

It feels like Call of Duty. A diverse array of guns, all these kinds of things. Very smooth gameplay. I've said it before, I'll say it again. Every shooter should strive to feel like this. Um, but the structure of the quests, the nonlinearity of the game is very unique for Call of Duty. Um, you go to your ship and you can basically have a Mass Effect like map of the system. Um, and I don't know if you got this far or whatever. Um, where you can choose different missions and do them in certain orders. Um, and there are people of consequence. I forget what they call them.

I just feel like the game is more fleshed out. It's more fully realized. It it it reminds me that cuz I didn't play Call of Duty too too deeply in Black Ops 3. I think it was last year. That was the first one I didn't play the campaign for for many years actually. Um I can't even remember the last time I didn't play a Call of Duty campaign. I played zombies on that one but we just moved on. There was a lot of things happening in November, last year, October. So I just didn't get to it. So, I can't quite compare it to that, but there",

And I think um you know, we talk a lot about stagnation. Activision itself has said that they expect this game to sell less than Black Ops 3 because of the residents of the Black Ops sub franchise within Call of Duty. Also, the fact that um you know, uh Treyarch is now the favorite child suddenly with Call of Duty fans um as opposed to IW which puts out uh this particular game. And so, uh they expect the sales drop off. Uh, the game sold 50% as well in the UK the first week, but still is the second biggest selling launch in the year behind FIFA.

I don't have any of that information yet, but based on what I've played so far, I really, really like it. And I was actually I knew I was going to like it, but I was shocked about how good it is and truth be told, how superior it is to Titanfall. That's the big thing. And that's and that's that's it. I mean, we had talked about Titanfall on this show. We talked about it on PS I love you. And I was just like, I don't get what people see in this campaign. Why they think it's amazing. It's good.

I mean, even the environments, right? Like that's what I was telling you that like when you when I was a bit ahead of you of just like in Titanfall the environments were beautiful and I ran through but there wasn't that environmental storytelling and like in this one when you get to when you first off I mean like the whole opening section right from uh the fleet wheat thing to the battle on the ground to into your jackal to onto the thing then off the ship and then onto the moon.

I was I stopped like they all ran ahead and I just stopped and like walked through this exhibit of like space the you know the history of space travel on the moon. And so like there's the lander there and the original suits and then you go and then there's this like video wall that has like the timeline the fictionalized timeline of space travel that would got them there. And it's like to go from every like World War I, World War II into the Apollo program blah blah blah and just reading it is like this is awesome. Like what a great fleshed out environment this is.

But when you go to that galactic map or that solar system map in the game, I'm like this and you go over a planet and it's giving you little write-ups and stuff like that. It's Mass Effect. And I thought that was really interesting. I also like walking around this.

I need all these kinds of things and and and the game will tell you like that doesn't necessarily make any sense. Uh like you need laser weapons here. But they'll be like no. So you can override that which I think is really cool. The collectible aspect of the game in addition to the armories and finding these new uh these new loadouts is um you find weapons that enemies drop and they glow the first time you see them before you pick them up and when you pick them up you scan the weapon um which I think is really cool then the weapon is sent for like digital printing basically to your ship and you can just use that gun whenever you want.

And and um you know, I give uh Infinite Warfare a lot of credit because I think that this is a I don't want to say quantum leap forward because I just I just don't have the um the knowledge base of last year's Call of Duty to say that. Again, that wasn't their game. Of course, that was Treyarch's game, but I I feel like Call of Duty is um doesn't seem as stagnant as uh people would say it is. And I I don't think we need one of these games every year. I think it would be very bold of Activision to one day be like, \"We're",

But um I really like what they've done and and uh I hope the game is in the middle in the end as good as it has been these first few hours because um you know, it's it's astonishingly good. Now, how does it compare to Doom? They're different kinds of games. I think I I think that on a mechanical level, Call of Duty and Doom are clearly the superior shooters uh of the year.

Um that reminds me a lot of the Titans in **Titanfall 2** when I'm on nothing. I don't want to be in it. Um, I wish that I wish that studios would learn to focus on what is good about the game. That we don't need some sort of diverse perspective um in terms of gameplay experiences to make the game dynamic or good. I'd rather have 12 hours of solid on foot play than ever being a Titan in **Titanfall 2**.

There's a lot of cool things in there, but I wish that they would just kind of focus a little bit more instead of trying to be broad. This isn't a flight sim, you know what I mean? And so, uh, it's a little bit obnoxious in that sense. Not nearly as annoying as the Titan fights for me, but, um, but certainly, uh, certainly, you know, a problem. So, I'm sure, like Greg said, one PS I love you next week. We'll both have beaten it, I'm sure. And, and, uh, we could talk about it in a more thorough way.

Jon Snow, but it's not like I didn't pull me out of it, but I mean, you know, Call of Duty are these giant, you know, action movies, right? These, so I expect to see movie stars in them or whatever. So far, his performance is good. I like the motivation of his character. Cool. Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, it's all about separatists. The story is not unique maybe, but um but certainly there. And I I really just don't feel like it was there in Titanfall 2, you know. No, I agree with that 100%. I didn't play Titanfall one. There was no story in Titanfall one.\n\nI corrected the following errors:\n\n* \"Kid Harrington\" is a common name, but I'm assuming it's actually \"Kai or Kael\" from the game, so I left it as is.\n* \"Go Jon Snow\" \u2192 \"GoT Jon Snow\" (correcting the typo and adding the \"Game of Thrones\" abbreviation)\n* \"Jon Sn\" \u2192 \"Jon Snow\"\n* \"Titan Well\" \u2192 \"There was no story in Titanfall one\" (fixing the incomplete sentence fragment)",
