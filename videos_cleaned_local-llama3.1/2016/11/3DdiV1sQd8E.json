What a hot item it was, and then when the scalper market really started to take hold right? And when we were in line for the PS3 and I was interviewing all these people because I wasn't buying one; I'm interviewing all these people outside of Best Buy. I said I went down the line, I'm talking to all these people, and none of them were there to have a PS3; they were all there to buy the PS3 to flip it and sell it. Whereas the Nintendo line I'd been in you know a month prior was all people who were excited about it. Then you jump into pre-ordering the Nintendo line, then uh the PS3 line here, there was one kid in there who was buying it for himself, and I was like that seems like a huge problem.",

And so when it you know came out and then nobody liked it, it was too much money. Like you know I had one friend who bought it in Columbia Missouri, that was like the PS3 for the PS3, and I was excited about the PS3. So for me it went that comes out in November January I get an email from Jeremy Dunham or whatever saying hey do you want to you know have an interview tomorrow for the PlayStation team? And I was like oh sure. And I remember sending off and I set it all up, and whatever. My girlfriend at the time she was like cool have you played the PS3 yet? And I was like oh man.

And that was with the six-axis controller - we didn't need rumble anymore, which was a disaster way too loud. Yeah, um... but it was a big step up from what we expected to get from the DualShock controller, which was like I remember that E3 when they first showed off the Sixaxis and I'm just like Sony, \"What the hell are you doing?\" Like, you got it right with the PS2 and the PS1 - just don't give us this crap.

It was that MotorStorm bundle they put out or whatever where I finally bought a PS3, and it was just like the library did not justify this price in any way, shape, or form.

Remember that there were three iterations of the PS2 - the super slim PS2 was very late in Emerging Markets; Brazil was buying it late, Eastern Europe was buying it late, Southeast Asia was buying it late. There was a lot of places where PS2 just kept burning, so I think that the numbers were inflated and gave them a false sense of security. And I think the PlayStation 2 is a great system - the PlayStation 2 is actually my least favorite PlayStation console, and going into... going into... (I know that's crazy to a lot of people), but it's just it.

They re-updated the PlayStation Store for a browser and put it on made it native on the console, they updated cross media bar and made the OS quicker um they also did many consumer-friendly Things. They removed Linux which really bothered a lot of people, they got rid of the SD reader, they got rid of the USB ports, the backwards compatibility; they did a lot of things to stifle consumers as well and I think that they did that um for cost-cutting reasons.

That was the thing, though - like and I think that's the lesson you see what Microsoft failed with the Xbox One was having a vision and sticking to it, and maybe even to the extent of the Xbox 360, right? We talked about XBLA when Greg was here; we talked about Xbox Live Arcade and then him leaving and how that's gone off and done its own thing. But that was the thing with PlayStation where the library is what it was - was, and that would define that console.
