Both of us look like babies; I just look terrible. The uh, it wasn't until the beard, you know? Let's be honest, I've always been great-looking, you know, well above average. Well above average, okay, sure, and can't even keep a straight face saying this.

The Atlas is easy and you just have to get through those sections; they're not complicated at all. They haven't made like a space flight sim that's of any depth, um. So but I said before that I felt like Titanfall 2 and not having experience with the original Titanfall, and uh, I like double jumping, I like uh fluid and quick arcadey style movement in shooters, that and the games are going in that direction now when and I respect that. Um, I think there's a place for the weighted kind of more s uh uh grounded games as well but I said in my mind Titanfall 2 went a little too far with the with the parkour; I didn't feel like I had full control over my character; I felt like there was too much that I could do and I understand that that's a",

And uh, I feel like even though Call of Duty has certain double jumps and zero-G combat and all that kind of stuff, I just feel like it's way more metered and way better executed. I just think this game is far superior if I had to recommend one or the other, I'd recommend Call of Duty absolutely. If you are looking for a good campaign, and like we said, it's got a mission structure that begs you to do things in different orders, and I think that that's really cool.

It's just that it's people are talking about like the be all end all.

Cuz for me in the character that I play in that game, you know what I mean? My version of him is sitting there cross-legged on his laptop and sending in the drone, sending in the rover, tampering with everything to knock people out to then move in and get whatever he needs and get out while everybody's knocked out. And so this is the one situation like oh I couldn't do that, so I brought up the weapon wheel had a shotgun, I had forgotten about it, had my pistol, had my Taser, and so I took the shotgun and started shooting and it felt so jarring and weird and it looked so crazy to see this character, retro, that I like so much, that is this happy guy.",

Even though I don't play many of them, I am drawn in by the idea of a game where you knock people out instead of killing them, where it challenges you to say, \"How can you not kill these people? You could easily blow through this game killing everyone.\" But wouldn't it be more interesting if everyone was alive?

It's all it's all about. So, I'm building my own world, which is making me immersed, which is then broken when I go outside of the that I'm creating for the character. In the same way, an IGN review sounds like it's faulting it for this optional thing. Yeah, I don't think I; I mean, I don't think you can fault it. Again, it goes back to The Witcher 3 argument. I don't think you can fault people for playing a game the way the game allows them to play it.

And how are you defining gameplay? Cuz I think I could make a case that there's gameplay in Gone Home - you have to collect these things to understand what's happening to advance... to get out of game play.

The gameplay is tapping a jar of mayonnaise that is it - you tap the mayo jar as it dresses up in various outfits. You can unlock the platinum in under 20 minutes. How can a game like this, literally a game where all you do is tap a Mayo jar for 20 minutes, get a platinum trophy? But games such as Gone Home and so many other actually fun games cannot. Where's the justice in the PlayStation trophy system? How can a game where you literally just touch a jar of mayo even be allowed on the PlayStation ecosystem? # Colin was right there is no quality check on the PlayStation store if games like this can get on with a platinum, so I didn't play this Mayo game\"",

I have my core PS4 games, I have to play right, and then I have my Vita games - so those are the only two things that I had to worry about. Now there's this third leg of the stool where it's now I have to worry about PSVR when I'm looking. So I look at these backlogs and I'm like all right, I really would like to get through more World of Final Fantasy, I'd like to play around more Dragon Quest Builders, I'd like to never finish Hitman GO, there's a few other things on Vita I want to do, then I look at PS4 and I'm like yeah, Dishonored looks pretty good, maybe I'll play Watch Dogs 2, Skyrim's kind of sitting there, Final Fantasy XV is coming.",

And then usually that would be the end, and now it's like, oh, plus now we have Battlezone and EVE: Valkyrie and... No Man's Sky Robinson and all these things, and they just keep coming out. I'm like, Jesus, the unintended consequence of PSVR in a way was that it's making my already-wieldy backlog even more unwieldy and unmanageably so. So, uh, that is an unfortunate thing because now you really have to be selective about what you're doing if you have all three options; then you even have two of them, which most people would have, just the PS4 and PSVR option, not necessarily the Vita option. I feel like it makes things more complicated, and then you really have to be selective about what you're doing.

Now, you have a lot of those ideas come internally. I mean something like Journey was clearly not inspired by anything right? It was inspired by something outside of games, I don't know what the **** inspired but it was no game that inspired that. So, those things happen every once in a while. But my hope is that great creators look at what Naughty Dog does and says, \"Like how can we do this because this is way **** better than almost anything else?\" So how do we strive through those? And so Crystal Dynamics should be and Square Enix should be complimented for saying like being so blatantly Uncharted. Because why wouldn't you if you have the capability of doing something like that, and an IP that works so well with it, and an IP that has not worn out its welcome, but those traditional Lara games before.",

Samesies, I didn't see people freaking out for them, right? Yeah, exactly. But I want to temper the expectation too: I don't want people who are not capable of making The Last of Us, for instance, to look at and say, \"Oh, we can do that.\" Most teams, most developers, are just simply not capable of making that game; don't look at that game if you can't do it properly. But do look at that game if you think you can learn something from it, take something from it, and make something new and original. And I think that's what they did at Crystal Dynamics with Tomb Raider. If you only played one or the other, you wouldn't even really care or know that the other one existed, but when you play them both, you realize how much they live and breathe off of each other.",
