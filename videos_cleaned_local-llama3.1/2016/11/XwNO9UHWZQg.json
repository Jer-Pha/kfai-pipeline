And so if I'm being honest, it's one of the reasons why I probably haven't been uh, I don't know, it's just that one deter for me to go like I don't really need to see that film right. And it's not that I like or dislike either of those two people. I love Mel Gibson; I've loved Mel Gibson ever since I saw Lethal Weapon for the first time and then realized he was the same guy in Mad Max. I'm like, this guy's an amazing actor, and so to see him tarnished like that it's kind of heartbreaking right um of his own device obviously of his own doing.

And I'm not saying that in the case with Mel Gibson; I'm just saying the guy who founded you know, Mozilla, was basically thrown out of the company for giving money to a pro-life cause, which I think\u2014and I want to be categorical about it\u2014is ridiculous.

And that's why it's complex right, where these they're not they're not devoid of humanity right, they're you can't separate an artist from being a human being as well and human beings are flawed we make mistakes um and we do crazy stuff every once in a while. Compound that to the fact that you or compound on top of that the fact that you're an artist and probably doing crazy stuff on the side like substance abuse, like Mel Gibson was loaded he was he admitted that he had eight double tequila shots before he decided to drive which is a stupid idea but um that obviously is fueling some sort of inner rage that he needed to deal with. But I think it's I mean we've talked about this before it's just same with our political candidates it's like we're",

Yeah, that was definitely years and years and years of being in the industry and seeing it from a certain perspective. And having a biased like that's just the way it is. Yeah, and whether or not he's coming to terms with that, I don't know. Because I've never actually heard him really apologize for it or say that he's really sorry that it happened. And I think often times with these guys who were on top of the world once, it's so hard for them to like swallow their pride and realize they're wrong.
