You'd be right except we hear Eidos Montreal, the large studio behind Thief and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is helming Lara's next adventure.

But I would put the fear of God into you - you don't see Rockstar guys ever leaking anything. Well, I mean, and that's the thing about it is we talk about leaks and all these different things, and yeah, Rockstar doesn't do this kind of thing. And you know what Naughty Dog did right when they were leading up to The Last of Us? They put out that email - don't be that guy, right? Don't be the guy who **** this up for everybody.

So there's a lot of secrets being told. We know a ton of things that are still not announced, but the thing here is that I just think it's unfortunate for everyone involved in the game, and you just don't see massive studios do this. The way Destiny leaked, for instance, was someone left a binder in a restaurant, that's how Destiny leaked right? Like that's a careless move, but not quite as careless as having your laptop open in a Subway. Um, so I wish the guy the best, but it's different like Red Dead Redemption has been in development for like five years, no one said a word, so there is the fear of God.

It would be interesting to see if it was a prequel uh similar or something that takes place in between the games similar to uh uncharted on V or something like that, but uh it would be cool to see a different character or someone that like a bad guy or some different perspective or a different Tomb Raider or whatever.
