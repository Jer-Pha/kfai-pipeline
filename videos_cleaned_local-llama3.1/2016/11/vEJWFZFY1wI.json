I know you guys don't care about Overwatch; I do, but do you think you could watch those trailers before the show? See if you get whatever here I've seen the Star Wars. I mean to what do you what do you guys think? I'm trying to think that's the problem. Yeah, that trailers have gotten to such a point right where they're usually great. Like when I think of like when you say best videogame trailers, right, I'm like I'm like Mad World Gears of War. Yeah, I mean like I'm not I don't I'm like trying to think of like Oh what what has been great this year and you know I mean like what is stood out above the rest and it's like see me, the art of the video game trailer is something I appreciate.",

We're at a point now where that stuff used to be awesome and the CG stuff, The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic does, yeah, all the Star Wars RPGs, ICO MMOs, those trailers are amazing. The Force Unleashed trailers were amazing, and now it's like if you show that stuff, you lose. You know, having a full CG as beautiful as it is - shout out to Dishonored for that CG trailer; it's awesome but people want to see the gameplay, and they're like, \"I don't want this.\" We're at a point where the gameplay can and should speak for itself, so it's like the art of the trailer these days is really tricky because I feel like it's almost impossible to please anyone.

Whereas like, does this Spider-Man reveal teaser act as a trailer because there's CGI in that, and then there's that little segment that looks like gameplay but isn't? I wouldn't count that as a trailer, but even that isn't... like, holy **** what an announcement! I was like, holy **** what a trailer! I can't wait. And that's true; that's true. Think about all-time maybe not best trails, but influential trails like Dead Island. Oh yeah, oh my god, is Dead Island?
