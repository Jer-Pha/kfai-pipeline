Um, but I'm glad that if people like it, I also can't speak to the multiplayer component of it. I played one multiplayer match, uh, pilots versus pilots. So I don't have a lot of perspective on that and I didn't play the original game, so I'm not going to speak to that either. As we said on PS, I love you, but, um, I have like 95 or 96% of the trophies. There's one trophy in there that's like really, really hard that I just don't think I'm going to get. So I think we're just going to kind of let, let that one go. Um, but it was, I, I'm glad I played it. I enjoyed playing it. I just think the, uh, I think the gunplay is good.

I think it's fluid. I think it feels good. I think I never wanted to be in a Titan. Every time I got in a Titan, I was bummed that I was in it. Um, so perhaps it's just not the game for me. And as I've started Call of Duty, uh, and I played that for, you know, three hours or so, it's just a far superior game. So, um, at least in my perspective. So, um, in a, for a multitude of reasons actually. But, um, so I really think that Titanfall, as far as the three shooters are concerned, having beaten both two of them on hard on the hardest difficulty and then playing one of them on veteran, which is the third, the hardest difficulty.

I think YOLO mode is one, which sounds so it's called YOLO mode. You only live once. Um, so I feel like, uh, that the trend has Call of Duty trending far ahead of Titanfall. If it thinks well together. Yeah. We're going to talk about Call of Duty coming up, right? Because I have things to say about that too. Second topic. Second topic. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that, you know, good time for shooters, if you like shooters, you're multiple shooters. I'm sure I can't really speak to that again, but the single-player campaign perspective, I think Titanfall is the least, you know, interesting. And then I think Battlefield 1 obviously is there.

You also played a bit of that NES Classic over the, the Extra Life. Yeah. Played quite a bit of it. It's great. Controllers, cord is very, it's an issue. It's actually like absurd. Like I don't even know what they were thinking. I don't even know what they were thinking with it. Why not even just make it wireless? But I think Nyko is doing third party wireless controllers, which is cool. It's a nice little setup.

Are there games in this machine that aren't available on Virtual Console? Well, I think the important thing is that they are recreated more faithfully than they are on Virtual Console. Virtual Console is really dull and the colors are just, it's the, it's like the brightness is turned down on a lot of the things. So it's like, these are like how they're supposed to be. Okay.

But yeah, just the excitement surrounding it as an outsider who has no nostalgia for the NES and was like, have you been able to play these games for a while? Yeah, but I think it's, it is having all of them in one place that's not the Wii U or the Wii. You know, I think that it goes a long way to, for Nintendo to distance themselves from those systems because people hate them so much.

There's no collaboration, like a combination of better, more important games anywhere than what's on this particular piece of hardware. Like if you look at the top 25 or even 50 games of all time, like more than, well, about half of them are on that thing. It's, it's, it's pretty significant actually. Mario 3 is on there. Original Super Mario Bros., two Castlevania games, a Mega Man game, Ninja Gaiden. I mean, there's really two Zelda games.

The whole thing we're doing is we need to get the DedSec app on as many people's phones as possible. Uh, and that will give us their computing power.

Cause like when we went and did the let's play, we talk about all the time. Right. Um, and by the way, that let's play was sponsored. This is not sponsored Ubisoft just, you know, gave us the game to talk about and like we review games. And uh, when we did that, let's play though, we just fucked around.

We discussed on PS I Love You that Titanfall 2 had this very peculiar thing it was doing where it would introduce these pretty cool bad guys. A very Metal Gear Solid like cast of characters that each had like their own unique Titan and their quirks. And they were all it was like a group.

But it just goes to show you the looseness and the non-importance of the plot. I think that you play Titanfall 2 because the game feels good. And I think with Call of Duty you play the game because it feels good with Infinite Warfare. You play the game because it feels good and because there's an interesting story and there's an interesting hook.

I think that parkour and sudden movements and platforming in first person is difficult. Not necessarily in terms of mechanics but in terms of understanding. You don't have the proper perspective to know where you are and I don't think the games work like that. So Infinite Warfare takes some of what Titanfall does but not all of it. It's 25% of that as opposed to Titanfall's more willy-nilly fast movement. So double jumping and stuff like that feels good in the game, but I don't have to run along walls necessarily or do all these kinds of things all the time. And there aren't these long stretches of platforming to show it off. So I like that particular component of the game. I think the AI is somewhat intelligent on veteran.

The game feels a lot like Titanfall in some ways in terms of the enemy variety that you're dealing with and all this. The one cool thing about it and I said it earlier in the first topic, and again not a unique thought which I remember where I read it. I think it was just on Twitter in a comment somewhere. Where they're saying this doesn't feel like Call of Duty and it doesn't. Mechanically gunplay feels great. It feels like Call of Duty - a diverse array of guns all these kinds of things. Very smooth gameplay I've said it before. I'll say it again every shooter should strive to feel like this. But the structure of the quest the non-linearity of the game is very unique for Call of Duty. You go to your ship and you can basically have a Mass Effect like map of the system. I don't know if you got this far or whatever. Where you can choose different missions and do them in certain orders. And there are",

And you're going after these different people and you're finding weapon upgrades along the way. And there are armories that make your character stronger in some way, giving you better defense or better buffs. Grenades are stronger, whatever happens to be. I just feel like the game is more fleshed out. It's more fully realized. It reminds me because I didn't play Call of Duty too deeply in Black Ops 3. I think it was last year. That was the first one I didn't play the campaign for many years actually. I can't even remember the last time I played Call of Duty campaign. I played Zombies on that one but we just moved on.

But there seems to be deeper systems at work in this particular Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare than I had ever seen in a Call of Duty game before. And I think we talk a lot about stagnation. Activision itself has said that they expect this game to sell less than Black Ops 3 because of the resonance of the Black Ops sub-franchise within Call of Duty. Also the fact that Treyarch is now the favorite child suddenly with Call of Duty fans. As opposed to IW which puts out this particular game. And so they expect the sales drop off. The game sold 50% as well in the UK the first week. But still is the second biggest selling launch in the year behind FIFA. So people are still playing it. It destroyed",

And I was actually, I knew I was going to like it. But I was shocked about how good it is. And truth be told how superior it is to Titanfall. That's the big takeaway. And that's it. I mean we had talked about Titanfall in this show. We talked about it on PS4 Love You. And I was just like I don't get what people see in this campaign. Why they think it's amazing. It's good.

It's it's it's it's Mass Effect. And now I thought that was really interesting. I also like like walking around this. You can go into that you have like your own chamber similar to Mass Effect where you can go on a computer and read about people and listen to voice recordings all this kind of stuff.

The collectible aspect of the game in addition to the armories and finding these new these new loadouts is you find weapons that enemies drop and they glow the first time you see them before you pick them up. When you pick them up you scan the weapon which I think is really cool. Then the weapon is sent for like digital printing basically your ship and you can just use that gun whenever you want.

I give Infinity Ward a lot of credit because I think that this is a big leap forward because I just don't have the knowledge base of last year's Call of Duty to say that. Again, that wasn't their game of course, that was Treyarch's game. I feel like Call of Duty doesn't seem as stagnant as people would say it is. I don't think we need one of these games every year.

Now how does it compare to Doom? They're different kinds of games. I think that on a mechanical level Call of Duty and Doom are clearly the superior shooters of the year. They're just very different. Doom is fucking fast way faster than Call of Duty and Call of Duty is fast.

I mean, this went on for a year and a half, two years. It was that MotorStorm bundle they put out or whatever, where I finally bought a PS3. And it was just like the library did not justify this price in any way, shape or form. And it was, yeah, I mean, I was taking it home for reviews, but like taking it home and enjoying was like calling all cars. And it was like, this is not worth buying for calling. So me and Micah can sit around and like calling all cars at home. You know what I mean? Yeah, I think that the specific angle that Sony took with this console",

Vita even was appropriately priced. I think that they learned those particular lessons that bravado is a killer. PS2 is the best selling gaming hardware of all time, but whether it's console or handheld, it's never going to be passed. No one's ever going to sell them any consoles or hard pieces of hardware ever again, not even close. So they had a lot to be proud of, but they also didn't look at why they sold it, sold so many units. I'm very convinced that 50, 60, 70 million of those are sold as DVD players.

Southeast Asia was buying it late. There was a lot of places where PS2 just kept burning. So I think that the numbers were inflated and gave them a false sense of security. And I think the PlayStation 2 is a great system. The PlayStation 2 is actually my least favorite PlayStation console. And so going into, and I know that's crazy to a lot of people, but it's just, I mean, I think GameCube shit on PS2 in terms of games. But from that particular perspective, it's interesting to study the history of it and figure out, well, how did they get to this point and how do they rectify it?

They were losing money, hand over fist with VAIO and all that kind of stuff. They just weren't doing a very good job. And they still managed to really burrow down and fix it to the point where PlayStation 3 sold at parity, if not a little bit better than Xbox 360 with one less year on the market. That's a really impressive thing. I think it netted about 82 and a half or 83 million units. That's a lot of units for context. NES, I think is at 60.

They got the PlayStation Store for browser and made it native on the console. They updated cross media bar and made the OS quicker. They also did semantic consumer things. They removed Linux, which really bothered a lot of people. They got rid of the SD reader. They got rid of the USB ports, the backwards compatibility. They did a lot of things to stifle consumers as well. And I think that they did that for component reasons. I think that they're probably paying licensing on Linux.

It was very impressive console. I remember my roommate Doug in college got it. The day it came out and I remember playing, I'm like, this is really, I've never seen anything like this. A console you can turn on and kind of interact with without playing a game. And apart from just like putting a CD in it or looking at memory card management.

It's just Xbox 360 just trouncing it. And Wii obviously, we have to remember Wii was a concurrent launch. Wii came out weeks away from PS3. Isn't it three days before?

Well, Sony did a really good job with PS3 and those lessons were learned with PS4 and the focus on games, the focus on exclusives to get those kinds of things going and operating all as they should in sync. So that's my memory of PlayStation 3. And I think that the library on PS3 is phenomenal. Well, that's the lesson, right?

But that was the thing with PlayStation where the library is what it was and that would define that console.

Like that's kind of how I really felt about it. I was like what is this? A Master System, I never saw a Master System with my don't you eyes after that ever again except for until I was an adult. That might as well have been the only Master System in existence. I never heard anyone ever talk about that thing except for the guy that owned it and he didn't even like it. It was in his room because he was the youngest and the Sega Genesis was in another room and the NES was in another room. One thing I know for sure is that I always looked at Sega a little skeptically. I owned a Dreamcast. I owned a Sega Genesis too but I owned a Dreamcast and that was the only console of theirs that",

I always kinda astound you when I play a 2D platformer or a shooter that doesn't feel right because I'm like there's so many examples of how to do this and I don't understand what you don't get about that. I think that there's some great gameplay being found in third person games too. Even in RPGs, I think Kingdoms of Amalur is a great example of an open world, a very nerdy role playing game that is about combat. It isn't about the story and it isn't about anything else except for playing it. Even though there's plenty to do in the game, that's a broken clocks right twice a day situation but they do exist. So don't write them off completely. I also think Infamous is another example of a third person",

So I think it goes out of those two spheres but I do agree that the 2D platformer specifically, 3D platformers to an extent but not really, 2D platformers and shooters, first person shooters are the kings, king and queen let's say of genres. Fighting games. Want to put them in that category as well. Absolutely, you're absolutely right. That's another great example and some games get it right and some games get it wrong and they're similar to Call of Duty vs. Battlefield, similar to all these kinds of things.

If you guys ever use it personally or visit the site slash content regularly, would be interested to hear your thoughts. So here's something that I've been saying for a long time. I think people's understanding of what YouTube gaming is from the beginning has been wrong. Before they announced it, I was wrong myself. I thought it was going to be a Twitch competitor.

In terms of is it a success or not? I mean it's made YouTube's live platform a lot better. Does it rival Twitch? No, not at all. It's taking them really long to kind of add a lot of functions that are necessary, like the moderation shit that they just recently added for comments and stuff. And does that work? No, people hate it. It's stupid. It's totally getting in the way and not working the way it's supposed to. And it's getting in the way of getting the right content to be promoted.

YouTube gaming is important whether or not you realize or care about it because it is taking gaming content and giving it focus on YouTube. YouTube is about music. YouTube is about lifestyle stuff. Gaming is a huge vertical there and it is giving people like us the ability to get on the front page and to be featured by YouTube themselves. And that's huge. So that's my thoughts. Yeah.

Dub Chaos says, hey guys, I'm an indie dev and while I've listened to the shows before, I recently picked up the habit of listening to them while working. I tend to easily get distracted. So your show's not only help me focus, but also keep my mindset in the game industry. So thank you for that. My question is, how do I get my game noticed by people, by the media specifically?

I thought you two have a lot to kind of say to this because you've dealt with PR people for so long. Sure. Go ahead. I was just going to say, I think that the conundrum that indie devs have, I'm not in media anymore, so I don't get the emails I used to get, is you have to kind of thoughtfully do it without spamming people, without like, you know, reach out to the right people. The guys at Yacht Club, for instance, had talked openly about how they identified me very early on in development of the game as a person that they wanted to go to with it, and they did because they understood my roots and that the game would resonate with me and therefore I would talk about it. And it worked exactly to their plan because I fell in love with that game very quickly.

Like, if your game's good, someone's probably going to notice it. And I know that's not the case in like maybe the phone space and maybe not even wholly in the PC space, but certainly in the console space. Hidden games, there are no hidden games on PSN that no one knows about. Like, these things spread around, and so I think, you know, I know that indie developers and games generally live and die on these first week, first 10 days, first two week sales, but I do also believe that there are games on the back end that once things organically spread around, if your game's really good and it gets on PSN or it gets on Xbox Live and maybe even gets on Steam, people are going to notice it.

Make a great game and someone's going to find it. I mean, it's just totally inevitable, and that happens time and time again on PSN specifically, where games come out and I'm like, what the fuck is this game? And then someone's like, no, that game's actually really great. And you go back and you're like, oh, it is really great. So I know that that's not a catchall. I know that there are games that have slipped through the cracks, but generally speaking, I've never heard of anyone find a game five years later and be like, why did no one talk about this game five years ago? Because it's not good and people would have figured that out already. So I think it's a little easier than you might",

So I think it's a little easier than you might think, a little more intuitive. Yeah. I mean, the answer, I think, for an indie developer in particular is, no, this isn't what you want to hear, but you go small. You are a small game. Target the small audiences and go from there. So many people, I've made this game, which is a success amongst itself that you finish the game, that's awesome. You worked two years on it, so you want it on IGN. You want it on GameSpot. You want it on all these different things. Those are the ones that get 14,000 emails a day and it's so hard. So unless you're going to investigate and know that there's a Colin Moriarty there or a Marty there, and they love these kind of games, and then you know them or you're able to hit them up, that's a struggle.

And then if it was that we loved it and we started beating the drum about it and it was a great game, of course we would then tell Marty not to cover it, but in conversation at a bar or something and then IGN is interested.

Don't send out the form letter with the screenshots embedded and all that other bullshit then because you just get tossed out the side unless you look through them and think they're cool. Yeah. I mean, I'm on the other side of it where not for games, but for making videos, like I have a lot of experience trying to pre-IGN even like when I was nothing, it was just like, okay, cool. How do I get, how do I become something? You know, how do I get people, the big guys to care about me?

Who is my audience for this? I'm not just going to send it to literally everybody because that's annoying and that's spam and people don't like that. I'm going to target the places that I know posted things similar before and I'm going to write them a message that yeah, the bulk of it might be copy and pasted, but at least some of the message is directed to a person with the direct call to action based on that person. So then reaching out to you about Shovel Knight, that makes so much sense. You know, for me, I knew Kotaku would, when I did the Macklemore game shop video, they do, they post fun things like this.

Like that, you got to think that way where it really does snowball. And once one person talks about it, it's all, everyone else is going to start. And the most important thing is to condense your message as much as possible. Don't write a whole press release that's boring as fuck that nobody cares about of just like why your game's awesome.
