I feel like groin don't really care about animated movies at all while Nim loves them, Nim - that's you guys by the way, secret Nim at all while Nim loves them and always checks out the new ones. Have you seen some of the critically acclaimed ones like Iron Giant or Inside Out? I feel like in most recent years people love to complain about how there are no original ideas in movies but there have been plenty of Original Stories portrayed in recent films, such as ParaNorman or Kubo and the Two Strings. How is that, butly a lot of people refuse to see them or acknowledge them because they're animated? Love you guys, I just love that his his",

Or I'm sorry, Iron Giant all the time people tell me all the time, \"Do you want to see the best Superman film of all time?\" I'm like, \"Yes, I do.\" And they're like, \"Go see Iron Giant.\" I'm like, \"No, that isn't a Superman film.\" It's about a robot. But it has been... I'm just surprised by... Isn't Iron Giant isn't Iron Giant like 15 years old now? That's pretty old. So I'm just surprised that there wasn't one more in recent is like the one of the cult remember, remember the commercial? I say that there was a song on the soundtrack that I really liked.

I want to say five months; no, since I think it just came out. I thought that maybe when you were like, \"I'm going to see this,\" I'm going to see this at... ILM Paul Gallagher, of course, working on many feature films. I thought, \"Oh, this is something that's exclusive and new.\" I didn't realize it's been out a while. I mean, it's new; I don't think it's in theaters anymore. It's not, but it's not on Blu-ray yet.
