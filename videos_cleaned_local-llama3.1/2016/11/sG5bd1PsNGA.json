The watchmaker's goal is to change the way consumers think about fashion by offering high-quality minimalist products at revolutionary prices. We got ours. They're legit. One Kevin Cole says that his is sexy as hell and it fits really well. Those are paraphrased quotes, but it kind of gets the spirit across. The company started by two broke college kids that wanted to wear stylish watches but couldn't afford them. So, they started their own watch company. Kind of sounds like when we left IGN to do our own thing because, you know, we wanted to do our own thing. I respect that. MVMT watches starts at just $95. At a department store, you're looking at hundreds of dollars. MVMT figured out that by selling online, they're able to cut out the middleman and retail markup, providing the best possible price.",

Well, now it's all screwed up cuz one of the downsides of Sparcade is that they put all your invites in your friends tab is all your friend requests and then the people challenging you to games. So, I currently have 430 friend requests burying all the games I need to do. But I found last night that if I sit there and just spam like this, it'll go through and catalog them a little bit faster.

And he had come when I talked to him more about it like uh through text when he was working on it. He was saying like, \"Yeah, I don't know if single player is like great.\" But then all the other reviews were like, \"This single player is awesome.\" And that's why I'm not ready just to be done with it. It's it is this interesting mix of, you know, you are this guy, you get bonded to your Titan early. you're not supposed to have this Titan, now you do.

But it is this interesting uh mix of like I, you know, everybody when Titanfall originally came out, they're like, \"Oh man, a single player campaign would have been great.\" You jump into this one and it's interesting to see how they break you apart from the Titan, put you back together. There's bosses that are in their Titans that you need to go. Other Titans, people show up in their Titans are talking **** to you through your comms. Your eavesdropping on their conversations.

And I want to, you know, play more of the single-player campaign to see if it turns that corner cuz I was looking through trophies and a lot of the trophies seem to be single-player oriented, which surprised me. I was expecting to be the opposite where I would play through ladder hidden, but it seems like the majority are single player. Very cool. Uh, I got to do a let's play of Sonic Mania that's now also on YouTube.com/conf. And uh, my god, that game\u2014it's everything I could ever want.

So, like I'm actually afraid to use to play it for more than about 90 minutes at a time because the computer I've never felt a computer this hot in my life. Um, you leave it on your balls. Well, I like to leave it on my lap and then I was playing it kind of like holding it like a book almost with my left hand using the mouse of my right hand like laying down on the couch.

So, uh, early impressions of Civilization VI are very positive. I think um, the game is excellent. I mean, I didn't expect anything more from that than that. And and people have to remember Sid Meier who used to work with at IGN is the one who introduced me to Civilization. uh he was a PC editor there and he works at Apple now and he was like you'd really I know you don't like PC games and stuff and you'd really like this game and so um I gave it a go when Civilization before Civilization 5 even came out and I fell in love with it.

Uh I like uh some of the additions that they've made uh specifically um creating wonders and other kind of things for your cities um or for your capital cities and then your ancillary cities that require um blocks of land. So, in other words, you'd have your city, it could be your capital, it could be uh it could have a massive population, lots of production, uh giving you science and and and all sorts of things, culture, but it's on one block.

So like one Civilization might be able to build a Pyramid. This is like very good for, you know, it could be good for their culture or their religion or whatever. The Hanging Gardens, I don't remember what they did, but I remember I needed a block near a river in order to have them.

Um but if you do that, you'll find some differences there. Uh I like the idea of the builder in this particular game feels and acts differently. Um you're basically using a builder not only to get resources, like one-time resources at a particular block, but also to create a farm. Once you do that with the, you know, with the builder, obviously, then the builder then disappears. Um, so you have to continue to create builders and stuff like that.

And you know, so far so good. I think it's a really great game. I don't have in-depth knowledge, I'm in the mid-game, so I don't really have in-depth knowledge of the endgame. Obviously you can win in a bunch of different ways - a scientific win, and you can have a military victory, etc. and so on.

One cool thing that I don't think was in Civ 5 that I think is really cool too is that so you learn your science and and all sorts of things and it takes time. It's all turn-based. So like you can say like uh I want to learn how uh I want to learn ship building. So it's going to take me 14 turns to learn ship building which is in the game hundreds of years. And um you basically are able to like take those 14 turns, but it will only take seven turns if you have founded a city on the coast. So like the game will like you have like the big you have like this big schematic obviously as Civilization games do of like this science leads to three sciences which leads to these nine sciences",

Unless you, you know, um, create a trade route with a neighboring city or something like that. So, I like that little thing, too, because then it makes you think a little more strategically about how you're investing in science because, uh, for instance, I skipped ship building and then actually went out of my way to build a city on the coast so that I would save those turns and went and and researched something more advanced.

Civ 6 is like who the hell is possibly watching that stuff? But anyway, that those are my early thoughts. I think it's really um really cool. I have questions. You go for it. First off, too, for transparency sake, we did videos with Civ 6 as well, hosting and interviewing stuff, so everything with a grain of salt. Uh do you recommend it for noobs, people just jumping in? It seems no more or less complicated than Civilization 5 in its own way. So, yes and no.

So like you can reach the Renaissance in 800, literally 400 years, 500 years before the Renaissance began if you're doing things right, you know, and I loved that.

So I like I like that particular thing. So if that kind of thing strikes you, then it's a fine place, I think, to jump in. But if not, then I don't think you should play Civilization at all. I don't think that necessarily this is any different on a core way than than five was at least to me. I'm sure the Civilization nerds out there see many more differences than I do, but I don't see that many differences.

I'm constantly looking at the clock when I'm playing games cuz I don't want to spend like my entire day playing a video game. But it was one of those things where I just forgot and then I looked up and it was 2:00 in the morning or something. I'm like, \"Oh shit.\" Like here we are, you know? Um so it is one of those games.

It's like all that's really what it is. It's like how much how much production can you possibly eek out of these people? How much gold can you possibly get a turn to start buying tiles or buying units or just saving it or using it to buy people off? For can you get into a fight with this this this other country and then make them pay you reparations for 50 turns, you know, like and then you just have all this money coming in or like are you going to get pincered and attacked?

So, I think that it's it's it definitely has the makings of that.

I mean, we were all at IGN. know how that works and we know and and I'm interested in what you think about this is just like so now they have a day to review it which is they have longer than a day they have as much time as they want to but but that's the problem is because of the ecosystem of the the media is that they need to get the views they need to get the clicks they need to be the first to put a review up like there is an absolute thing of who's first who's second who's third and then when you're the 10th person putting up a review it",

Well, I disagree that it doesn't affect us. I mean, I was talking about this to someone yesterday cuz people were like being like, \"Well, why are you defending these corporations?\" Like, I'm not necessarily I'm seeing where they're saying where they're coming from. I'm not defending it. I want to be very clear like if I was a publisher, I wouldn't I'm not sure that I would want to do this yet. I understand the business rationale behind it. Um, and it probably does nothing but benefit them to do this. Oh my god. 100%. But it is not their problem. It is not Bethesda's problem if GameSpot can't get their review up in time. They",

But it does materially affect us because it might take us a week now. We might have had Mafia 3 impressions earlier than we did, which might have saved some problems, especially because the game wasn't very good, but that's again not their problem. This is why I'm saying that this is a total neutral effect on gamers. Like, you don't have to pre-order games. You don't have to play the game the day it comes out. You don't. If if you keep saying that you have to, then frankly, you're the one they're trying to prey upon. Like, and that's what it comes down to with this is this says that they did research.

So, it's just like, you know, why would they, you know, kind of work with that when they could make more money? They're a business. And it's the thing I mean, like to the point that I think you bring up that for me is a big one, right, is like the reviews will suffer. My problem with that argument is, and this is me throwing a stone at the IGN I worked at that I was a part of IGN. We had Skyrim originally before release. No one caught that the PlayStation 3 version was bugged because that's not how you review games. You review one, you play an hour of the other versions, you're like, \"All right, graphics are a little less whatever dot da da da da.\" It's not there isn't a scientific process.

There isn't this checks and balances. There isn't a red team. It is. And I think what this is a reflection of is the fact that the jig is up on a lot of those sites that the jig is up on the traditional games journalism model, right? Like if you're one of the people that are talking about here that they're talking about here, right, of like, okay, don't pre-order. Just wait for your favorite person to do it. Watching a Twitch stream for 30 minutes to make sure it's running fine, that it is the Skyrim you remember or Dishonored 2 is going to look cool and have cool things. That gives you enough information to go out and pre-order in that second instantly on your PlayStation on Steam whatever you're wherever you are you're a click or a button press away from going to get that game and you don't necessarily",

Some people disagreed with it.

He had a really interesting series of tweets. I'd like to read them from last night. Right. The issue with Bethesda's review policy is that they're more than happy to use those same outlets to get the word out via preview coverage. They want it both ways. They want the wait and see approach that naturally comes with previews, but won't face the music at the end. Lame. Then",

Ultimately, the job of the media is to ignore the backroom **** and do the job. Uh, they'd get the marketing elsewhere, blah blah blah. Anyway, we live in a weird hybrid thing that creates that cares slightly less about timely reviews than traditional outlets.

Pre-order, like exclusive pre-order bonuses here and there. And I feel like it's on the developers and publishers to come up with pre-order incentives that are worth it if they want us to pre-order. The pre-order incentive nowadays and what Colin Moriarty is talking about, what we're all talking about, what the statement is talking about isn't anymore.

But what this allows is for everybody, media and just normal gamers alike to be able to be part of that same conversation.

This deprives the performer of the ability to make a meaningful decision about whether to accept a role or to negotiate appropriate compensation if they do. Precedent is on our side here.

Right there's that, the argument for the pro-strike people, there, the people who are against the strike are saying, I don't see why I should be compensated like this if they're not, if the developer isn't compensated the exact same way, and that's where there's this interesting thing where in the middle are the developers.",

Uh when you look over on the film and TV side of it thing, there is rules. There's a setup for how this all works.

Yeah. I mean, so when you speak about the the film or TV side of the whole thing and the royalties and all that, there's above the line and below the line in production where the I don't remember the exact fallout of all of it, but I mean, like there's there's actors, there's directors, there's these people that are considered above the line and below the line is the production stuff. It's the director of photography, like these people that are making the thing happen. Like without them, it really does not happen. But they don't get the same type of credit.

But it there needs to be some type of uh distinguishing factor between where is the line draw, where is the line, you know, what roles need to be des like deserve to get uh royalty style revenue for if the game does better. Call of Duty does super well. What does that mean? And I think that as we we grow, like there's this this thing of voice actors and what you're talking about about them being celebrities and stuff there.

Like those names start getting into the fold too. I think the step after that became Troy Baker, Nolan North, where these are now people that have followings based on who they are and what they do in the the industry. And then there's the thing of people look at them as not just voice actors, but as actors, and they they really stress that that we're actors. And now in video games, they're not just voice actors.

I remember last year tweeting out when this was kind of being talked about for the first time, I guess when negotiations began saying something like the gaming industry is wildly broken if um people that work on the game for literally weeks um are getting these backend payments when we work on the game for years, you know, and get nothing from voice actors, not just developers.

Whether it's the minimum salary, whether it's arbitration, all those kinds of things. The voice actors are on the periphery of the game development thing and they'll get all of the the financial backend gains even though this entire team of people actually allowed this to happen, you know, allowed this game to be created. And there's there's a there's an interesting argument to be made there that to what you were saying which is that like the entire unit needs to be unified and unionized for this to work.

Not for nothing, TV and movies is really expensive to make in part because of unions, right?

It was terribly bad. Some people crossed the picket lines but like some players did but the product was so bad the NFL basically was like we need to figure this out.

The developers are still making the games, and there are 75% of the games being made in which these people have nothing to do with at all.

And even with that said, it seems like, and you can take it with a grain of salt, but I don't know why the business was a lie. In fact, it would be illegal for them, I think, to do that during the course of union negotiations. They basically said like, \"We did meet all these things. Like we did, they wanted 3% a year over three years. We just gave them 9% off the top. Like we did we did say like uh we would have this this and this and I was reading things where they were saying like part of the problem is that the union wants to call the pay like the new payments one thing and the and the and the publishers want to call it another thing because they're leaving the door open for their residual payments that they want.

I could do Shocker and I could play myself in the in the animated series, but the the thing is is that I just don't think they have the leverage and I don't think that because the entire team's not involved per my NFLPA example, it just doesn't really affect the traction of the of the game's development.

Yeah, I think that you know I have a massive problem with public unions that are that are unionized outside of the realm of putting your life at danger. So, I think police and cops have every right to have a union because they're actually putting their life on the line. But the guy sitting at the IRS that's unionized, I think that's absurd. Anything that has to do with taxpayer money, I think shouldn't be unionized because that's really kind of predatory on the taxpayer. That's one segment of unionization.

Meanwhile, um it showed in more southern states with Japanese car manufacturing that those unions might not necessarily been necessary. And so there was blowback, right?

Well, I mean, I think, you know, so mobile gaming gets so much **** But I think that something that that should be said about it is that so many people that are not gamers would never say they're gamers. Games have not affected their lives at all, have been addicted to Candy Crush, they've been addicted to Bejeweled or Jetpack Joyride or whatever it is, and they play those things. They wouldn't call them video games, but they are video games. And I think that that is what people are just going to start growing up with. Whether you're playing on your PlayStation 4 or uh the Nintendo Switch or on your phone, people are playing games. And whether or not they know that they're games, we are now growing up in a in a place where uh my girlfriend that's not into video games, handing her a controller and saying play is a lot easier now than it would have",

I think the touch thing uh across DS and across uh just video games in general. Now, touch is just a thing and a way that we interface with tech. People grow up using iPhones. So, the crossover to video games is just it's natural used to be. Before you had to try to play games, now you just play games.

And um they're a part of the fabric of who I am and and certainly, as you said, are part of why I am the way I am and who I am.

But whether or not that person gets Uncharted 4 or not, it gets that like video games are not just a waste of time per se. And by the way, they are a massive waste of time. There's nothing wrong with that. Uh I've said that before. Almost everything we do is a waste of time. Um I watch sports, I watch football for 12 hours every Sunday. That's a massive waste of time.

They were gone like that and now we're back to a baseline again of hardcore gamers which is a different kind of person than a person that plays a game on the phone. And I don't think that one's better than the other, but it is worth saying that the games we're necessarily talking about are not games that you play on your phone. Um, and so I just feel like people have to kind of keep that in mind. It's not who cares, you know?

Hey guys, Rockstar did an incredible job on giving a first-person experience to Grand Theft Auto on the PlayStation 4, and it's kind of surprising that Resident Evil 7 will be in first person as well. My question is this: What games would you like to be remade or have a sequel with a different perspective? I'm not just talking about going from third to first person or vice versa. Sidescroller, isometric, and top-down can also be considered. I'd be interested in having a Metroidvania 2D style sidescrolling Uncharted. Keep up the good work. You're a fan from South Africa. What's your champ? Let's be clear that almost anything in Metroidvania style would be better than the way it is right now because that's the best way to play a game. Uh",

I I always go back to Mega Man Legends or Mega Man 64 which people like love for some reason and I'm like why? Like so like just just because sometimes people want to change. Um so but it also goes back to what we talked about with Final Fantasy, the so-called Final Fantasy disease and all these kind of things where we have expectations what games should be. Um, while I like to see games kind of molded or morphed into different things, like Resident Evil 7 being in first person is strange. But that makes sense actually.

So that's kind of where I stand. I'd like to see what the developers want to do with certain things. I think a sidescrolling Uncharted would be awesome. Be careful what you ask for, though.

I I forget the name of it, but Gate of Light. Guardian of Light. Guardian of Light. Yeah, Guardian of Light. I feel like that was more of an isometric thing. And I feel like it really kind of uh went to the heart of what Tomb Raider meant to you playing it growing up.

So with Hitman Go that was great, but it really was kind of like very different than the Hitman games. But with Laura Kofko, it's like the it it felt like what Tomb Raider would feel like if Tomb Raider kept happening. You know, way simpler, way dumb down, but the idea of just like the puzzle solving and all that, it felt very true to what Tomb Raider is. And I think the perspective change and um gameplay change as well really kind of helps with that. So, next question. General Moses, do publishers ruin games?
