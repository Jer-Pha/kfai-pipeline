So some examples include riding a bicycle, typing on a keyboard, typing in a pen, playing a musical instrument, martial arts, dancing, commercial Jingles and songs. So I want to know when does muscle memory kick in for you and what other memories go along with that? Commercial Jingles and songs yes fall into this category, they absolutely do. Have you ever seen when there's like a documentary and I can't remember the name of it but where they go to a nursing home and they start playing music and people can actually like start singing with them?

We take that kind of stuff for granted - imagine other keyboards, like Cordic keyboards or Vorak keyboards, where the top row is Dvorak instead of QWERTY, and they're used in Eastern Europe and some other places. Imagine typing on that! I remember my high school had old computers with alphabetical keyboards, yes, 386s with those - it would take years for me to figure out how to type on one of those.

Cuz I feel like that's the type of thing that we as a society would have broken if that was true because now it's like we would have transitioned over to something else to be quick and efficient, because the type of people are I think is one of those things, it's like you know we're still on using well now it's just natural again right.

I'll tell you what the most annoying thing is: when you have a keyboard you're typing on in a foreign country that's almost like our keyboards but it's like three letters off, and so every word has one thing that's completely wrong - that's just you, so know I hit that in Morocco; in Morocco, it's not it's not the",

Like CJK stuff is that how you would say it? Sure, I think so. But still, I mean, do their keyboards have those characters on them? No, I don't think they do. Like, I've seen computers many computers in Japan when I was there that were using totally QWERTY keyboards. And exactly. And that's kind of one of those things I never looked it up like after the shower. But I always... There have been multiple showers that I've thought about this.
