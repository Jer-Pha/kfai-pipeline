But basically what's going on is that, uh, voice actors that are represented by SAG-AFTRA, which is a union, Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, have gone on strike. This is fewer than 25% of games affected by this in terms of the voice actors from this being involved in those games. So I don't really know how significant of a strike this is to be perfectly frank. Um, but on SAG-AFTRA's own website, this is their call to action right. This is what they say this is what the union says why they're going on strike. And it and here it says: \"Why we strike.\" Very very overhead cam says: \"SAG-AFTRA tried for more than 19 months to negotiate a new deal with employers in the video game industry, meanwhile performers have been governed by the more than two decade old contract still in place that has left voice actors without the protections necessary to work in the modern\"",

Uh, end quote. And that's according to Chief Contracts Officer Ray Rodriguez from SAG-AFTRA. Then, uh, Kelsey Farley, a voice actor, casting director, and voice director who chairs SAG-AFTRA's Interactive Committee said, \"SAG-AFTRA doesn't want a strike; who does?

That shakes out to potentially four session payments per principal performer for the most successful games: 2 million, 4 million, 6 million, and 8 million copies. Producers hide important information; transparency is lacking in the video industry. Actors need to know more about the projects that they are working on. SAG-AFTRA has proposed that the actual title of the project and the role being hired for should be made available before signing a contract.

And then transparency - it says the union proposal requested additional upfront information about when booking performers in video games, including game title, uh name, new role or reprise of a previous role.

Right? And I think it's no coincidence that this is coming up from SAG-AFTRA after we see voice actors now rising to a celebrity status, where you see like Ashley Johnson is Ellie, Troy Baker is all these different characters, Nolan North - you can go down this list of people that are these characters are these names that are on the cover at E3, that are going out in front of this in a way that they never were before.",

Yeah I mean so when you speak about the the film or TV side of the whole thing and the royalties and all that there's above the line and below the line in production where the I don't remember the exact fallout of all of it but I mean like there's there's actors, there's directors, there's these people that are considered above the line and below the line is the production.",

I think directors, um, sometimes producers and uh actors are the ones that get the credit; they're the ones that get the royalties; they're the ones that kind of grow in that way when it comes to video games. It's like well what's the difference and what are those roles?

So in 1982, in 1986 or 1987, the NFL had a strike and scabs played right and especially in '86 and they were terrible; it was terrible like notoriously bad. Some people crossed the picket lines but like some players did, but the product was so bad that the NFL basically was like, \"We need to figure this out.\" There's a movie documentary called The Replacements about this, starring Keanu Reeves.

Like, everyone was gone and that's not the case here. The developers are still making the games, and there are 75% of the games being made in which these people have nothing to do with at all.
