This was done pro, this was before Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy, oh yeah, holy **** there are old. If I remember correctly, there was we've done this topic is twice, one was officially, and I think that was after Guardians, okay. Um, but there was another time we did it, and we mentioned Guardians and being like I don't know, this seems like it couldn't work, wow. But but we were still like we were positive about it, we were like we'll give it a shot, sure. Like but Ant-Man, we're like I don't know, like we really don't give a **** about Ant-Man when it got to Doctor Strange, we're like Doctor Strange get the **** out of here with your magic ****",

Um, but we were proven to be stupid for being so worried they nailed it with all those movies. Um, then on the other side of that though, Ant-Man was the first one that I felt was like a by-the-numbers thing you're crazy, it was fun, Paul Rudd is awesome, the villain was garbage, it wasn't bad, story was like whatever exactly exactly yeah. But are we just going by the Blockbuster then the Transformers movie should win best picture? No but I said it wasn't bad and it did well, it's both of those because on the flip side there's the DC movies which great they did well um and they pretty much all went exactly how we predicted they would. Um, Suicide Squad being the thing that I'd say we were most off about because we were like it has a chance of being really good no it didn't no not be the worst one that chance",

Well, so then the other thing that we were talking about was the X-Men movies and that was one where I'm not going to say we were wrong, but we weren't right. We knew we didn't know about Apocalypse back then though. We did know it was coming. I think people were looking forward to it. We gave it the Surefire like it's going to be good, and it was. Bryan Singer was back on track - that's the thing. That's where like I'll give us partial credit. Uh, but we didn't expect it to be bad, and we definitely didn't expect the Fox movies to have another like fail point, and they definitely did. Here's the thing about Apocalypse: We've all seen Apocalypse. Did you see it in theaters? I did. Did you see... a period? I saw it on a plane as I watch all my movies, and I didn't think it was",

Don't get me wrong; not good, but people were talking about it as if it was bad on the level of Fantastic Four on Batman & Robin. There's so much hyperbole now. I can't... I get not liking Batman v Superman totally, but when people were like, \"It's worse than Batman and Robin,\" I'm like, \"That is impossible.\" Very few things are worse than Batman and Robin. When you know... um... I liked Apocalypse; it just wasn't as fun and cool as the two that follow. That's the problem: inevitably they were on track to make really good movies, and one of them was going to be not as good as the other ones. This one just kind of failed by such a wide margin that I think that it was... it was very apparent that they're starting to derail very quickly, but the concept was cool, and the implementation.",

It was awesome, it was by far the best part of that movie, it was cool, but I just feel like they need to like when I think of what a Wolverine movie should be like I think that it should be probably the most violent thing you've ever seen like I I feel like it should be on the level of of like intensity and",

Isn't the rumor like the first 15 minutes there's no dialogue it's Hulk getting shot into space or something and then he lands and he runs and then he runs around a corner runs into Thor and like that's the start of the movie. Haven't heard that that's right, I'll try to recall. Awesomely, what are they doing like Planet Hulk style stuff? Or is this an old ride inspired by that? Oh awesome, well that kind of makes sense right cuz the last time we saw him he was like flying away flying himself away. Uh Justice League November 2017 it's going to kill numbers. Wise It's not going to get good reviews no the trailer that I that stuff they released I was like this looks awesome this is what I want to see and I know that I'm totally a DC fanboy whatever I enjoyed Batman v Superman take it with a grain of salt whatever but like that interaction between him and the Flash I thought was",

Yeah, I'm listening. I'm still trying to find my thing about the Thor thing: How much of it do you think is that we're still reeling from the Nolan universe and that people just don't understand the vibe of this versus they? I mean, granted, they haven't really nailed it that much. But like this will be the first one we see where it's it is that sort of like kind of plucky, like Affleck - you're not sure if he's trying to act or not the entire time, but it's fun. Yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah, like I give him two more movies for... I'm like, \"I'll be fine with this.\" Where at first I didn't like Ben Affleck; I was like, \"I don't get this guy's humor,\" and then finally I watched Argo.",
