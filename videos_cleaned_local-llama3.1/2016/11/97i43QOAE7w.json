It's gonna be on iPhone, iPad, all iOS devices eventually on Android; it's gonna launch in a hundred and fifty-one countries and regions on December 15th. And tomorrow runs supports English, Japanese, watch all the languages. The three modes are the main mode, there's Toad Rally which is the competitive score attack mode with endless stages requires tickets to play which are unlocked by clearing stages in the main mode, and the Mushroom Kingdom mode which lets you make your own Little Kingdom which seems to give you other bonus video minigames.

And like, I don't game on my phone so it will be that just like Sparkle or Tetris right in a distraction when I feel the need, I'll probably get into it and be addicted for a little while and forget all about it and go alright. That's still happening. It looked interesting. I am excited that people are excited about it. The point Colin's making about them charging for it is good. I do appreciate that. I also like that this was you know the debut of being able to pre-order on your iPhone and the app store, being able to jump in there actually put your money down get the game you know not early but get the game you know ready to go be set for it.

But I do like how they've stuck to their guns, and I like we're charging a premium amount of money for these games; that's just the way it's going to be. And I'm sure that they have lost a lot of customers, but I wouldn't be shocked considering that they've held the line for so long that they look at their projections and like we're making more money than we would have made if we made this Final Fantasy game $1 or free to play or something because like we don't care about the spread shot approach, the blue ocean approach doesn't make them money; what makes the money is finding premium gamers willing to spend a premium amount of money on a product so to see now",

And while they might be wrong about a couple things, like them saying stuff and then being confident up to say stuff because both of them confirm it with multiple sources before they write a blog about it is worth listening to at the very least and worth discussing. In the last couple weeks, Laura Kaye Dale says today's report backed by one previously used source and one news source which I vetted through thoroughly is that the UK specialist gaming retail chain Game has been informed Nintendo Switches wholesale price to retailers and is planning on sending the basic SKU of the system in stores for \u00a3200. It's important to know this is not Nintendo set RRP, as in the UK manufacturers are not allowed to set RRP prices for consoles.\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n* \"rumors\" remains unchanged\n* \"Laura Kay Dale\" was left as is (no change)\n* \"Game\" was capitalized and corrected from \"game\"\n* \"Nintendo Switches\" was corrected to \"Nintendo Switch\"\n* \"\u00a3200\" was added with a pound sign, assuming it's a UK price\n* \"RRP\" was assumed to be an abbreviation for Recommended Retail Price, which is commonly used in the gaming industry.",

However, it's safe to assume this gives us a solid indication of the price the system will sell at nationwide. There's also rumors of a second SKU, the premium one, that could be \u00a3250. We've also heard that the current plan is for the more expensive one to come bundled with a new version of Splatoon. A big part of the push will be a 1-on-1 versus mode where two players on separate Switches can fight over a map, switching the weapon of choice at will mid-game. Nintendo expects the short match nature of Splatoon to translate well to handheld multiplayer. They're also planning to add additional single-player content to the game, and for the Switch version, the game will have similar free content output as one of the two - the one the Wii U had over the last year.

Also, there's rumors that the Skyrim port Bethesda refused to confirm is real is totally happening. We've heard his plan to be a launch day release for the system to mirror the recent remastered versions of the game and to allow mods at some point time post-launch. Huh, mod support for Skyrim will not be there from day one, and much like the PS4, it will be limited to mods made using existing in-game assets. Lastly, we've been told Nintendo's planning for the Switch to be close to direct conversion price comparable across regions, which we have been told is tied into their push for the system to be region-free. This would in theory put the U.S. price tag of the system at approximately $250 and $300 respectively for the normal and the deluxe editions; this is based on conversions not any insider information so",
