I give him credit for coming out and saying this is our thing rather than just quietly continuing to not put out the games until the day before and every time have IGN and Kotaku and GameSpot put up a thing of like here's why you're not getting our review on time, here's what's happening they're coming out and they're saying that all right cool we're the market has changed landscape has changed this is how we're doing it.

Frankly, and they were like, we gave that game out; we got that game out in October; that gave everyone enough time to create, craft their things, whether they liked it or not. Some people really liked it; some people thought it was okay or whatever. It probably damaged the game, and they probably looked at that and said, \"We don't have to do that anymore.\" Like we don't; we're not going to do that anymore, especially with Skyrim because it's a known quantity.
