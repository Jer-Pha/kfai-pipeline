Nobody's coming by knocking on our iron gate door asking for candy; language barriers left and right.

You get to see things I don't if I'm insulted or flattered that every time you look at me is when you start laughing hardest. It's true though.

Yeah, well, the process there it goes through you're like it's late October and you're like what would I be next year? I'm going to start planning in June. No, you're not. No one is. But like you could be anything right? I could... it's it's the one day where it's legitimately okay for me to walk down the street dressed as Batman, and that's it's awesome.

Well, I think a big piece of the criticism is that it became less about telling a story and more about playing with viewers' emotions and reactions. And it's like, it's less about storytelling and then more about the fake outs. That's the entire thing. And that started back with the cliffhanger last season, which people were super upset about. Now, the thing to keep in mind is this episode ratings went through the roof so it worked for them right? And will people actually leave?

I think the episode does a great job of setting the, you know, where the Escape is for the entire franchise going forward and looking at the rest of the season and we're going to see all of the story play out. I think another piece of the criticism is like, alright really what's the point of these deaths besides character development for other characters and that's like, that's kind of a copout but it's like when it's The Walking Dead, that's what it is.

Um, which it turns out is basically the one of the only ways you can get used to this. And that's the specific like therapist that I'm seeing right now is a person who basically his approach to it is take a little by little, but you have to do what's called exposure therapy, which you have to start putting yourself in these situations and figuring out these tools and techniques to calm your brain as you're going through them.
