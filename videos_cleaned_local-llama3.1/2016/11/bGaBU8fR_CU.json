And I'm sure they weren't just this kid's dumb whatever. Move on to the hundreds of other letters and poems and art and things like praising this band and thanking us for our work. But I never thanked them, and I never had the chance to because I didn't understand the situation or how the world works at the time. And that sucks.

One of my favorite rappers, one of my favorite artists of all time. I can tell you so many facts about details of songs and like lines and everything.
