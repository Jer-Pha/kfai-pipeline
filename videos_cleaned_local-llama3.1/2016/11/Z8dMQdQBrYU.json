Watch Dogs was one of the reasons I bought my PS4 on day one, and you all know the result of that game. Now, Ubisoft worked for at least a couple of years to fix the issues in the sequence of the game, ending the annual cycle of Assassin's Creed to focus on Watch Dogs, and again I feel like the game could have been much more than it is. I'm having a lot of fun playing it; the visuals are amazing, and San Francisco is faithfully reproduced, but I'm seeing so many problems and bugs during my gameplay that I keep questioning myself if the game was released before it was 100% ready - cars that disappear, problems in movement, problems in getting in and out of boats, problems with sound effects, and much more especially in",

I think a lot of people are like really hot on Infinite Warfare because to be honest their expectations were pretty low coming off so the past like two Call of Duty campaigns.

I own a Vive, but to that point, I had a friend \u2013 this happens all the time, right? It's like when you have people over and they don't play games, and then okay, when the Wii came out, right? Every person who came over to your home got to try it: \"Let's play tennis!\" Right? So, it's happening now whenever we have someone over; we have to clear out all our bloody furniture and then stick them in the sweaty headset and give them a go.

I don't care. Like Watch Dogs, I want the Platinum, so it's cool when I finish these missions, I'm getting Silvers for them, I'm like, \"That seems way too much,\" but I'll take it.
