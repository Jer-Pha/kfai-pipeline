And like Final Fantasy, I'm like enjoy the combat, don't like this and I'm out. But for this to come out, I have the review embargo post basically rev you in 140 characters right. The people who were like **** you, I was like oh yeah I forgot that this kind of **** exists.

It's like, no, give me the right experience, and I feel like it was stretched out a little bit too much. Like, there were a couple moments that do repeat from a story perspective where I'm like, \"Alright, there's only so many times I can see this.\" I had Uncharted syndrome with a couple of things where some of the set pieces started to feel repetitive. Um, where I'm like, \"This was super cool the first time,\" but in Uncharted, it's always the last second when Nathan Drake jumps and grabs something right before B, and it's like that happened in this game over and over and over again. Like, how many times are bridges gonna fall and he jumps and then he makes it, but he almost doesn't make it? It's just like, \"Okay, I get it,\" and it's cool, and it's beautiful, but it starts to feel less cool as it goes on. But then towards the end, it gets amazing from a",

I've heard, I know what the ending is, I've talked to people about the ending. I mean, I mean again, it's one of those things where I I really believe that if this game was half as long, it would be a lot more powerful. Because every moment would feel like it was building towards something. With this, I feel like the the pacing is just just off enough to go to good instead of great. Because the end, the end is fantastic and like, just take you can't just look at the end but playing through at least enough of the game to understand it and then seeing the end, it's powerful and it's cool and it's very much like Inside where it's like what the happened in",

But I think they did a great job of just the way that he animates and the way that he moves is believable, uh, enough that it feels like a character that I've never seen before in a game or a movie or anything. It's like there's a bond with that that's different than a bond you have with amazingly well-written characters, like yeah Nate and Elena; they're awesome in Uncharted.

I think that's the thing is this game makes you care, and I was motivated to keep playing through it despite its frustrations, and I do think that at the end of the day, it was totally worth it - it was worth all of it, it was worth the millions of delays and the years and the trailers and all that. This game is what they promised; this game is what they showed us years ago, like, and that's something that I want to give them credit for. In comparison to Final Fantasy XV, because what we got from Final Fantasy XV was not what I saw 10 years ago - what we got for The Last Guardian was what I saw however many years ago.

Yeah, and it's it definitely it's a it's a nice journey overall, like being able to play it and and see all the thought put into every piece of the game cuz again it's an art game you know we we did our review about Inside and it's like not only is this a video game to be a video game this is a video game to be art, see and that's one I get the most",
