Dragon Quest 8 - did you play that one? Uh, no. Dragon Quest 8 is one of them; I think I didn't play that. That's the PS2 one. Um, people love it. A lot of people talk about that. They talk a lot about seven and eight as their favorite ones. Um, and so I have very little input on it. Nine was the last one I played. Well, I played Dragon Quest Heroes and Dragon Quest Builders, but so I don't know much about Dragon Quest at all. So I know that there's the ones that they're localizing for the first time from Japan. Which ones were those? Uh, eight was out here... The ones I think you're thinking of were uh five and six, but this was on DS in 2009.

Um and I certainly dropped out after a few hours, I'm like this just isn't grabbing me, the combat system is weird, I don't care about these characters and I really thought Exile was a really great step in the right direction so I'm excited about this just to see how Babasans and those guys have responded to that and put the stuff out there um and uh",
