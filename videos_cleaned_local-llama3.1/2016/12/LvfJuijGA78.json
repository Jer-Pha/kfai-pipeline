So, you know, the movie came out, they put it on I don't know how many screens - Pablo or someone could tell you - and then suddenly like the people at Fox are going, \"Are you watching this?

Um, and you know make sure that that is still infused into everything that Lucasfilm creates. And you go to Skywalker Ranch and you sit in a big room with like 10 other writers and you come up with story ideas - it's a fun way to spend a day, that's awesome, yeah, that's awesome. Is it much different than writing the movie? Because the movie I imagine you work, I mean you're talking to people but primarily you're just kind of by yourself right when you're developing, yeah. It's much more... well, not again on Rogue One, I I can't really go too much into the process, but you know I worked very closely with Gareth and there were other people in the room that you know are kind of suggesting ideas, but for the most part on a film, yeah it's generally just you on your own and you might be working with",

Someone says \"what if this happened\" and someone says \"oh but what if you did that and added this twist\". It's a kind of \"two brains are better than eight brains\" and 10 brains are better than one, and you all break the stories together. And then the episodes get divided out - like who wants to write which episode? I really wanted to write the wedding episode, they let me write the wedding episode but that story was created as a like...as almost all TV shows are...as a group of people in a room figuring it out as a team.
