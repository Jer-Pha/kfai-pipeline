No one's gonna watch you play video games, and you're not gonna get paid that much for it.\" In your face, luckily though eventually she was not she was like a really casual gamer, Candy Crush on that kind of stuff.

But I can relate to that because going back to that same relationship, whenever I went over to her family's house, she had a younger brother and he was only allowed to play for about half an hour a day. And here I am doing that full-time. So to them there was just like, \"What you know, you're with this person who his job is to play games all day to talk about video games, yes.\" And then he wants to do it full-time just play games for other people.

It's what I think the numbers are, softer they said in terms of it, but I mean, like whatever, it's not like a huge drop-off, but it is that thing. I don't know how much I know the remaster did really well this year, but how many remasters do you have up your sleeve? Like, I feel like you could start seating these out of these studios to do different things where it's like, \"I'm cool.\" So if Infinity Ward is doing the Far-Flung features, Sledgehammer does pass stuff, and then we'll have the more contemporary stuff from Treyarch. Yeah, be smart to split up that way. Well, so just keep alternating to keep it fresh. Jojo, so they prayed, \"Oh, you suck\" for Halo Wars 2.
