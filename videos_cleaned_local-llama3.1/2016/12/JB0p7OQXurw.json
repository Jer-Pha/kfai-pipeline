I've hosted with you many a year. Alongside Tim Gettys? I'm gonna try something new. And that's what you came up with? Don't deviate from what Tim hosts then. Jesus Christ. Over here at the Pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. How are you Colin? I'm fine. I'm a little stressed out. But I'm alright. I'm good. Are you excited about this? I'm excited about it. Don't know that that would be the word that I would use. Ladies and gentlemen, it's one of my favorite nights of the year. The Game Awards is here. Game Awards 2016. We will be watching along with you in 15 minutes, or not even 12 minutes now when the show goes live. We will all chill out, watch what's going on, react with you. We'll be quiet when we should be quiet. We'll be loud when we should be loud. Right now it's the pre-show. We're hanging out. After",

Well you don't think... I think the real trailer, quote unquote for The Game Awards, will just pop over and do that thing. I think it's two trailers. Why would they do two trailers? That seems like dumb Nintendo stuff. That's what they're doing. That's what they're doing. You see that Switch logo? I did see the Switch logo. Did it give you the chills? Yeah.

And the Pok\u00e9mon Company, I'd like to thank all of the amazing trainers around the world who have joined us. I know, the guy holding the trophy. We're grateful that we've been given the opportunity to inspire so many people to get off the couch and head outside to explore the world around them and learn more about the communities along the way. We get to listen to the TV? We have a lot more planned for the game in days and years ahead. And we really hope you'll continue with us on this adventure. Thank you. You got mine from my desk.

For those of you that are watching, I will give you a little insight. I'm going to tease you a little bit as Greg goes and sucks my pee pee. Been editing.

What are you cooking up with Randy? So I'm here to announce Bulletstorm: Full Clip. This is an over the top first person shooter. Skill shot, combos. One of a kind stylish gameplay. 4,000 people.

First of all, I know there's a lot of folks at home looking forward to your sales in line with the Game Awards. You can preorder it as of right now. If you go to the digital dashboards on your favorite platform, you can preorder it. Guys, you can preorder the video game. There's no reason to do it. But go ahead and preorder it anyway. Give Randy a pitch for some money before you know anything about it. You can play the whole game where you swap the main character with Duke Nukem. With full voice over replays and with John St. John, you can become Duke Nukem in Bulletstorm. It's insane. So this is not Bulletstorm 1 re-release, right?",

Check it out. World premiere. Oh, there she is. There we go. World premiere. That's a good jam, Colin. I know you don't like music. What a big deal. They try to kick Bulletstorm. You pull people in, you kick them. You cut your hand and you drift. What was the connection? Couldn't ClippyB have a connection to this? Epic was the deal? I think it was some people that worked at Epic. I think that's the case. Gotcha. I could be wrong. I was thinking the same thing actually. I was thinking, what was his connection?

I mean Duke Nukem happened and it happened 20 years ago. So now we can walk away from it. Well, I want to announce a couple of our other award winners as well. We've got tons of awards in the show, but we do want to recognize everyone in the right way. I want to announce that the best fighting game is won by Street Fighter V. Congratulations to the team at Capcom and Ono-san. We were all wrong. The prediction was I didn't even give one. Tim said Pok\u00e9mon. Colin said Killer Instinct. Best VR games. We all said Batman.

And Reggie will be on stage a little bit later to share. It's kind of the problem with the show. It's supposed to be an award show, but they're like let's premiere a bunch of things and then we'll just talk about the people who won for five seconds. Have you seen any award show? Yeah, they have a little song and dance for everyone. A person comes up and they talk over a microphone and they have a thing. Oh, Tim was right. Tim got his first right one there on the Zelda.

Mick Gordon came all the way from Australia and he will be here performing a medley of songs from Doom. We'll have some great surprises in the show as well. So stay tuned for that.

This year, it was particularly challenging to pull everyone together to make tonight happen.

But for a minute, I want to talk about a great man behind those games. Last year Hideo Kojima's world was turned upside down when he left Konami after the completion of Metal Gear Solid 5. We all have tough times to go through, but the true test of one's character comes in how we react to those moments we don't control. When judgments are made or when decisions are rendered upon us by others that we sometimes can't comprehend. I think what happened to Hideo Kojima last year was a tragedy. But he never complained.

When I've questioned things in my own life over the past few years, I've drawn strength from seeing firsthand how Hideo dealt with this inflection point of his life. He is one of the most principled, loyal, and ethical men I have ever met. And I'm just so honored to call you a friend above everything else, Hideo. Now, this trophy right here, I've got to tell you about this, for most of the past year, I've tried very unsuccessfully to give Hideo the award he rightfully won last year from Metal Gear Solid 5.

Then I said I'd drive this myself out to Las Vegas to personally hand to him when I saw him in February, and he politely declined that. And I soon found out why. He is such a principled person that eventually word came back to me that Hideo just said, Jeff, I can't have that blood on my hands. He had to move on, and today, Hideo is rebuilding his life and his studio with our support. Pete Hines on Twitter talking to me. I've known Jeff Gerstmann for almost two decades.

It just sucks that everyone already knew it. Like, that would have been cool otherwise. What else we got? There was some of those. Oh, the Zelda stuff. The Legend of Zelda trailer is fucking awesome. The Zelda gameplay. It's like we didn't need that. It looks fun. That's the thing is it was a whole new area. Like we haven't seen that stuff.

Brannox brings up best parts, entire Kojima sequence, that Dragon's Dogma acceptance speech, the Doom performance. Nolan North nor the speech agreed. And then worst parts, other musical performances. I mean, honestly, I thought the speeches were great. I really, I thought every speech was awesome. Yeah. I don't know if you see it, but it's on point. OK, good. No, no. I thought Nolan North speech was great. It is interesting that there's so many high profile voice actors that don't say anything about the performance matters, about the strike.

I think about how, you know, it's not so honky dory with a lot of voice actors, I think that they know how tone deaf this is and that the strike is clearly not working. So we know game developers personally, lots of them. And you hear a lot of harrowing stories about their lives because I know people that have gotten divorced over working on a game too much. And you hear kids' birthdays being missed, kids growing up while their parents work crunch, working eighty, ninety, one hundred hours a week on these games. I mean, listen to Amy Hennig's speech that she gave just not too long ago about her time on Uncharted.

Well, we throw the word friend around. I'm fucking around. I mean, we're all basically acquaintances. Agreed. Yes. So I really feel like that it was an important and salient thing for him to come out as the most notable voice actor that has ever been in games and may ever may very well ever be. You know, depending on how diverse it gets in the future and come out and say this is bullshit because that's basically what he said.

I'm sure I know them, but I have a lot of cash. And that doesn't matter. They're not going to promote it as Mass Effect, starring whoever. And so I think that, you know, voice actors do have their own experiences that I think are tough. They should be treated better. And but people that are like, well, the voice actors are doing this for everyone. I'm like, bullshit. No, they're not. And second of all, if you unionize all game development, watch all your games get developed in Eastern Europe and South America, because that's exactly what's going to happen.

Look at all the great games that are coming out of Ukraine and Poland and Brazil and all these places. So I think that that was a really great moment. And I want to give Hideo Kojima I haven't seen him in a while, but I want to give him a lot of credit for what I thought was a really, really great moment on the show. And my only concern, other than we talked too much about the show itself and how how maybe it shouldn't exist or it wasn't very good or whatever.

But I mean, you've been saying that from for every conference they've been showing up at and they continue to show up at every conference. I mean, let's not fool ourselves. I bet they're at PSX. I bet Hideo Kojima comes out with an extended thing like here's the rest of Metal Gear Solid's scene. And that is the weird thing of like at what point do you fucking take the cork and put it in the bottle and you stop pouring this out?

But I don't think we're done seeing little bits and pieces of this. I'm on the other end of this with you. And we've spoken this many times, but I think that not every game, but I think the game, the industry needs games like Hideo Kojima's games or like Final Fantasy VII is to Kingdom Hearts or whatever. And like those are kind of on the other end of the spectrum of like, all right, it's a little bit of a joke of how long they take to do.

Like Kojima games to me mean something. And they mean a lot of ridiculous 15 minute trailers over the course of four years before you get to play a game. And I'm cool if that keeps happening. Like it's I'm about the hype when it comes to the stuff. And that's what these types of shows are about. So I like seeing them. I like that type of stuff. And I'm happy that we got way more than I thought we were going to for this game. I thought it was going to be maybe like I predicted even for PSX.

Sony just signed this game when you're looking at it through the context of how long it takes to make a game. And like you were saying, Hideo Kojima and Mark Cerny traveling around the world looking in search of new technology is one of my favorite things that happened this year. Was, you know, they found their engine and I have no doubt that the game is going to be compelling, but they Sony PR specifically, because they're really responsible for this.

Like people are asking, clamoring, getting excited, you know, because, yeah, we have a lot of questions, a lot of curiosity. But I don't necessarily think that hype is good for these games. And in fact, there's so much evidence that hype is terrible for games. There's actually an overwhelming amount of examples that hype is terrible for games. Look at No Man's Sky. No Man's Sky.
