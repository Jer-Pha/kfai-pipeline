Um, so first of all let me just say like again P speaking purely as a fan, just purely as a fan, that is probably in my top five Star Wars scenes of all time, that scene of definitely ends it's like the thing that you always wanted to see him do, just straight up murder everyone in the room right? Cuz that's what it's like you've seen Vader right fight Obi-Wan Ahsoka, you know uh these other you know uh you know characters that are basically kind of can take him on one-on-one uh and you've seen him toy with people like he like could kill you any time you've seen that but you've never seen the",

I love that final kill door, the lightsaber action on the other side. What I was telling my wife, and I was like, \"You don't understand,\" like I haven't seen a scene like this in a movie since... like the scenes that I think of are like when you first saw the Terminator, right?

Like, like Vader seemed great, fantastic, but the fact that when that happened, when we see the hologram and he's like \"I feel\" - twice now I've seen it - when when Mads is giving that speech and he's saying \"I've planted a... a thing, a trap, on the floor\" and you see people realizing, oh, that's what's going on. I I turned to Kevin who had already seen it and I was like, it's the most obvious, simplest, most genius thing - that was perfect.

I personally got sick of people on the internet with these memes that go around. Well, if the Empire's so smart, how did they miss it? I was like, 'I'll tell you.' Yeah, I will literally tell you. It's so good; that was such a great 'aha' moment where I was like, 'Oh yeah, that is this.' I love again, I love that it comes from a place of like... it's an act of defiance right? It's there for a reason, and you understand. Um, and the other thing I love about it - this is more of a general thing; I haven't done this yet, but I think when next time you watch A New Hope now that you know what it took to get those plans that far, don't you feel like you'd be more invested now in everything that happens to them?

In my um, twice I've seen it: when you see her from behind, people cheer; when she turns around, people gasp. And like, the F-the-line anti says what is it that they've sent us?

And I have this personal theory again just as a fan that if the Empire had never built the Death Star, they probably would have won just through attrition, just let the Rebellion fall apart on its own, like they can't agree on anything. Whereas we not only have superior technology and superior resources but we have one guy at the top telling us what to do, and even though dictatorship is not great for the galaxy, the Empire is way more together than the Rebellion, even with all the kind of jockeying for ambition and power. Um, but when they build the Death Star, they they do something so egregious that it forces the Rebellion to say, \"All right then, then it is war.\" Yeah, yeah, right then, then they have no choice but to but to do something that we they never would have done if you know the Empire had built",

Another huge compliment I can give this movie is that I think that it gave so much lore building to give people the ability to have theories uh beyond what we're we're just expecting because like with things there's so many theories about who's Snoke and all this stuff for episode 8 and IX but I think that with this it's cool because it's giving us the ability to now have theories about something that we thought we already knew so well and it opens up all these different doors. And I loved seeing the the Shades of Gray on both sides whereas you know back in the day it was the light side and the dark side but then even with The Force Awakens, with this new that kind of now we're going to begin to make things right it's like it is trying to show that hey not all bad guys are horrible and not",
