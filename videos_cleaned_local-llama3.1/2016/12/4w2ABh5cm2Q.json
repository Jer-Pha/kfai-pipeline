Um, I've never been to a Universal Studios, which is a little heartbreaking cuz it sounds like it would be fantastic there was a Fast & Furious ride, right? Yeah, um, I'm going to just pretend that it's not Universal Studios and we're just talking about Nintendo Land, pretend Nintendo's doing a Disneyland-style thing. I want to talk to you guys because I'm sure you're the perfect audience for this what rides should there be? Oh see, I was way more into restaurants, Nintendo Land, whatever the whole experience, I mean cuz Disneyland It's there's shows there's restaurants there's shops there's rides there's experiences there's like video games in it and arcades and stuff like that. What does this what does this look like? I can't wait for like the incredibly racially insensitive like Mario's Mama Mia pizza place or whatever some Italian food",

And I'm like, no, it's kind of good to head your bet with someone else who knows it all. I don't know that, I don't know that Nintendo has the draw to do it on our own. In addition to that, I think like we've seen things like with Legoland where it's just like, yeah, Lego could totally do it by itself, it's like they probably should have just partnered with someone else. Yeah, I think just get to more people. I mean, cuz I think I think isn't Universal also doing like Harry Potter World? So now it's like this whole you know amalgamation of stuff are there? You're bringing in different people and then they see that something for everyone The Nintendo Switch so I think that's a pretty cool idea as far as rides are concerned. I mean, what I hope and I I doubt will happen but what I think what I think would be cool is to try to leverage as much IP as possible and I think",

And I think it would be cool to focus on Mario and Zelda and Donkey Kong, and whatever else. But I think it would be cool to have Ice Climbers or something like Balloon Fight. How could you do the ingenious things with this that make these IPs relevant? And then could you gather some sort of market data about how these things do in the park to see if they're IPs that might live again in some sort of limited way? Um, and so I think that this should be interesting, um, at the very least interesting from a marketing perspective for Nintendo to see. Well, of course, Mario is going to do well, but it can't all be Mario, and it can't all be Zelda. So, do you like do you have something really niche for Earthbound fans? Do you do like a Metroid area?\n\nI corrected the following errors:\n\n* \"Nintedno\" \u2192 \"Nintendo\"\n* \"IPs\" (corrected to match the context of \"Intellectual Properties\")\n* \"real Niche\" \u2192 \"really niche\"\n* Added capitalization for proper nouns: \"Mario\", \"Zelda\", \"Donkey Kong\", \"Earthbound\", and \"Metroid\".",

So I do think that there would be cool things like that. Cuz yeah, an Ice Climber ride where like it's like an actual mountain climbing thing that could be freaking cool - like an endless mountain climbing thing, see how far you can get. Cuz like the thing about Disneyland is they have the rides that are like the Buzz Lightyear um game or the Toy Story Mania where it's like you get the guns and you sit there and like... That's the one I was thinking for Metroid. Yeah, you compete against each other. For Metroid, what I'm thinking is Star Tours - Star Tours is like the 4D ride where you have it's the 3D screen and stuff blows by all that's going on and you're in like a a a ship with a group of people and you're all experiencing at once like going through a trip.

I think that'd be awesome being in a spaceship flying around and like landing on planets and stuff going on in front of you would be dope. Now I know the store already is going to sell the Mario cap, and you could get your name on the back of it, like Disney ears, right? If they want to go the extra mile and do it for nerds like us, a lacat hat \u2013 you put it on, it's the little cloud, and then he's sitting up there with a camera. Come on, come on. I like it. What what I want is I I want the Hub. I know you don't need it, Colin. I said I don't hate it; I you don't hate it; I definitely don't need it, but like Disneyland, the center of it is the castle. I think that's apt here as well. I want the Mario 64 Peach area, I want a remake of the entire area \u2013 the trees with the circle-ass sure, sure, you know, branches and stuff.",

Now do you think at some point someone's got to step up and be like, \"Are we copying Disney too much?\" Nobody's going to do it right if you're doing it wrong. Just let's not PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale this, all right? Let's not get there. So we're in Mario Kart, I want Mario Kart to be an experience where you sit in the thing and go through a storybook ride like they have, but mixed with the Cars Land ride that takes you through the whole story of cars, but it ends with this awesome race where you like, you do you race, are you in control? No, you're not in control, but two cars next to each other.",

Um, but I would want it to go through multiple different like tracks on Rainbow Road, coming off on you like you feel like you're going to fall off the side and then you go it'd be awesome. It'd be so cool. And I feel like I'd imagine that to be a lot of practical stuff in rooms and each room is a different course. And then the last room would just be like a giant video wall all the way around Rainbow Road and just turtle shells and items flying everywhere. It'd be cool if there was some way, like you're talking about randomizing it. If there was a way of like the randomization is that as you're going, you drive through the question mark blocks and then you randomly get a weapon that you have a big button to hit",

Another important part of theme parks are bathrooms and what I want this is again now stick with because there's two different ways you can go with this one but this is again one of those little touches where like they built this for us in the urinals I want you know how some people in the urinals they put like the B on it and you're supposed to aim at the be. Give me a little Mr. Gaming Watch right there now and if it's one of those urinal games where you pee on it, right, and then you play a game even better.

Luigi's Haunted Mansion it's easy but you know it's is Tower of Terror style haunted no thank the Tower of Terror is Bowser's Castle now hear me out you go through the Tower of Terror really is only one ride part the rest of it's kind of you're walking through the experience like the line is part of many Disney rides, the line is part of the ride.
