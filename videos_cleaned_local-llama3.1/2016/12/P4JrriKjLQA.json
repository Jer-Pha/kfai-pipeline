I'd also uh Galaga - you put Galaga on there, I think that's I think that's apropos, I **** with Galaga, you **** with Galaga, okay, okay, okay, I feel you; um, I would, I mean, would put Breakout or Arkanoid on there, I wouldn't put both, and Breakout was first, I think Arkanoid is better, um, let's go Arkanoid then, yeah, I think I think Arkanoids, you know, I love Brick Breakers, and it's it's an it's one of those genres where you can't really there's only been a few games that have done something interesting with it since then, Shatter being probably the best example of it, but um I love Arkanoid",

Um so I believe that you know belongs but I wouldn't necessarily have to say at the sake of AR is not the original Brick Breaker, but I think the best brick breaker any other prees um yeah I would say Donkey Kong should be on the list. Um Donkey Kong OG; Donkey Kong I don't think so. I think Donkey Kong 94 deserves the spot. Donkey Kong Country No Game Boy the 1994 Game Boy. I never heard it called that. Um yeah, I don't even know that I've ever played the Game Boy Port. So oh it's it's far superior; it it it includes all the the Donkey Kong OG **** but there's this whole it's one of the best Game",

I know people really love adventure and stuff like that; um, I would say River Raid is one of those games. Boom, it's on there. Can we move on to the NES? Yes, we can be here all day. Yes, we can. Let's do it. Let's begin all three Marios. Yeah, definitely. Uh, I will say this, Tim, and I think you'll agree with this: that let's say per capita, the NES only had I think just north of 700 Western releases, and I think that per like pound-for-pound, NES is going to have the most games per console of any other console in other words, like a massive swath of the NES uh library compared to say PS2; PS2 had like over 4,000 games, and so even if you had 50 games from the PS2, I don't think that would anywhere be near the number of games you put on.",

Even if you had 50 games from the PS2, I don't think that would be anywhere near the number of games on your list. That would be fewer per game than what I think you could have. I think you can easily make a case for 30 or 40 NES games like yeah, because these are the kinds of games that were significant, like Quantum Leap from Konami and Atari, and all that kind of stuff to NES was significant. Now we've seen jumps like that later on, but what an NES allowed you to do compared to like look at Pitfall compared to Mario Brothers - they're actually the same game, but one's very rudimentary and one isn't. And you see that across genres and across games and across franchises and across series. I mean, I see like all three Mario games, all three Ninja Gaiden games, all six Mega Man games, all four Dragon Quest games - like these games are masterpieces",

Could you really argue with any of those? That's the thing I think. You could say my thing is that in the same way that you're right, the NES games are so far away from the 2600 games. I think for pretty much all the franchises, the Super Nintendo version is better than the NES version, but it doesn't distract from the NES version. It doesn't, but I think they do improve. Link to the Past is better than Zelda: A Link to the Past. Super Mario World in my opinion is the best 2D Mario game. I agree that between world and three, it's very close. Uh, but for me, world is definitely It Takes the Cake, and then in like",

The SNES I think only had like 10 or 15 more games in the west than the NES did without publisher constraints that were artificial during the NES era, so you're on both of those consoles. I actually think the SNES's library is a little overrated compared to the NES Library which I think is a little underrated, but I don't necessarily disagree that there are you know C Super Castlevania IV with mode 7 and all that kind of stuff was like the Whip and turning the stages that turn thought it was incredible. Um, I don't think it's better than Castlevania III, but I will say that Super Mario World is better than Super Mario 3.",

I obviously Mario would take the cake in terms of sheer platforming and execution in that way, um, but the same thing with Ninja Gaiden where those three games are Immaculate, and so like which one would you remove? I wouldn't remove any of them, um, so I mean that's where I stand, but I don't want to monopolize for the sake of this though I'm going to leave the decision in your hands for Mega Man X, Panic, and Ninja Gaiden. I mean, I would, if I had a prune something, and I think I, I don't think the original Mega Man is that great, like I, I Mega Man feels heavy",

The game's a little harder too, although that's not a problem, um, there's no E-tanks, continuing is a little different, um, the boss gauntlet at the end is... or gaunt rather... is different, um. So I would remove one, I mean, obviously two and three absolutely belong on the list, and I would put all of them for five and six on there as well, so... um, I don't know that you could possibly deny, and you could make the argument that the games actually get more impressive even though they don't have the same nostalgic resonance anymore.

Oh, that's that's I I really don't think it is because we got to think holistically about this because we we can't be too top-heavy in the beginning because there are so many games that come after that.

Yeah, um, and uh we were obsessed with those games, and I was obsessed with HAA like I thought he was a character, I still think that the first one is the pinnacle of the series, although there's a massive disagreement on them it's similar to Mega Man 2 and 3, like you know maybe not quite as heated because ninja guy is not as popular. Mhh okay so Zelda I would put them both on there, I I would put Zelda 2 on there absolutely you put Zelda 2 on there, I think Zelda 2 is great and like it's definitely very special but like when you're talking about the top 100 I don't think it fits there it's just it's too difficult",

So I think Zelda 2 did a really interesting job actually of not only giving you a world to explore that was different and I felt more meaty because of the D like because of the nature of the dungeons as opposed to the original Legend of Zelda. But also giving you an interesting story without really telling you anything, the fact that you start with Zelda's like pass out body on that on that altar or whatever, I think is awesome. And um, I don't know, I don't think it's as good as Link's Awakening again, but um, I don't think either of those games are as good as any of the Zelda games that came after with the exception of Majora's Mask",
