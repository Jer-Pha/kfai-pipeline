Gamespot notes a downward projection for Activision's annual sales. The Behemoth company notes that sales are trending upward because of promotional activity and sales but concludes that overall sales should be down 20% when compared to last year's Call of Duty offering Black Ops 3. Interestingly, sales at retail should be down 35% in total; a number partially nullified by Infinite Warfare's strong digital performance, up 15% over Black Ops 3.

I don't have a question but rather a comment regarding Colin's point about Kojima Productions' marketing strategy for Death Stranding. After checking out the Kojima Productions panel on Saturday, December 3rd, they confirmed that the engine they are using for the game is partnered with Guerrilla Games, who are now currently nearly ready to release Horizon Zero Dawn. I have to figure this game could actually be in 2.5 to 3 years max since most of the assets for their code are shared, which is unlike the Fox Engine for Metal Gear Solid 5, in which they had to build everything from the ground up. Regarding the danger of overexposing Death Stranding, I've watched YouTube pundits including Hideo Kojima's analysis of the first two trailers.",

I've watched YouTube pundits, including Hideo Kojima's analysis of the first two trailers released so far, and it is clear that the two are married together to make a larger point about what this game could be about with themes in the vein of Interstellar and Stranger Things. There are too many parallels between the two that clue in on the premise of the game, and it appears that will was always the plan for both to release within a close time frame to each other. I don't think that this is any different than the rest of Hideo Kojima's releases in terms of hype building; I think it was smart, well played, and shows that he is continuing without Konami in perfect form. So I hate to disagree with Colin's point about them overexposing granted I know he said they are close to overexposing so maybe they weren't exactly there yet.

I'm way more bullish about that game there's no way it's gonna be ready anytime soon. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if that game came out in 2020.

So I'm asking it again here: With the launch of The Last Guardian, I've seen much discussion about the controls and the implementation of Trico. Some people say that the clunky controls are a design philosophy to emulate the difficulty of a human moving in that world, similarly they say that Trico's unresponsiveness is a designed feature as mentioned by Naughty Dog to emulate trying to communicate with an animal.
