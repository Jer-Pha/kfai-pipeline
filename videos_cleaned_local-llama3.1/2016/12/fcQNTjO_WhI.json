For the price of a stamp, you can help these Vitas have a second chance. All you have to do is join the Vita Relocation Program. If you've been neglecting your Vita, send it to our PO box. Once we receive it, we'll private message one of the candidates looking to adopt over at KindaFunny.com/VitaRelocationProgram. They'll send us their address and we'll mail your Vita to a new loving home for free. When this inevitably becomes too much work and we stop mailing Vitas, Greg will carry the Vitas with him to 2017 events like Kinda Funny Live 3 packs or PSX and all folks looking to adopt will have to do is ask him for one. Again, to be clear, ask.",
