Yeah, it's important, I mean, I can't speak for Greg; it's important to note that I've played each of those games for a few hours. Yeah, so here's the thing: we were going to call this a review, but we're like, no, this is...we didn't do enough to do a review; just going to be what do you think? I've just been busy with that kind of stuff, so what I was thinking about this when you brought up this topic. The interesting thing about these particular games is that they're both games that had very tortured developments. Um, and what I think is so, Doom was announced all the way back in 2008; people forget about that. Doom Four was it was called; it was announced in 2008, and they scrapped it, and they made it again, and that's how we got Doom. And Homefront, I mean, Homefront 2 was so old that THQ still existed",

I mean Homefront 2 was so old that THQ still existed and announced this game and people forget Montreal THQ (corrected to THQ Montreal) was developing it then it was kicked over uh to European Studios like Crytek (corrected from \"krych\"), then Crytek owned it, then Crytek went under, their Studio went under, then Crytek UK became Dambuster Studios (corrected from \"Dam Busters\") and then the game was sold to Deep Silver (corrected from \"C media\" and \"K media\"). And that's how it became an open world game. And like so I thought it was interesting that these games coming out the same week, or really a few days apart - they didn't come out technically the same week, D came out first but that they both come from this tortured lineage and one turned out pretty well and the other didn't turn out very well and the one that turned out well I think is Doom and that's not a huge surprise and the one that didn't turn out well was Homefront and that's not a",

And they walked me through very specific things that have to happen, but this is how it might occur: like a North Korea which just can't even feed its own people instead becomes this military powerhouse that actually invades the United States. I'm like, okay, um. And I liked kind of the story; it was unorthodox but interesting. And in this new one, the new one pretends that Homefront never happened, which to me doesn't make any sense because the original Homefront sparks a revolution and it could have been the spark; it could have been the point at which this game began.

The original Homefront's intro was even better, I thought, because it was here's the geopolitical forces of how this would go and where it would go. Whereas this was just a gruff voice giving you a rundown of \"they made the smartphone, and then they turned everything off.\" Like, this is just Dark Angel-esque. So, my assumption is that in the story at some point China must have been the bad guy, and if not - I feel that way about the original Homefront 2 - there's like some I could swear that was true though, or maybe I'm thinking Red Dawn; yeah, Red Dawn is definitely they definitely had to change that.

I knew that it was open-world; the game takes place in Philadelphia, which I think is very cool. I think the city is well-realized there is a darkness and an atmosphere to it, to the revolution all these kinds of things. I think that that's great but everything about it is just kind of like not very good, and from like what I can tell, and that's disappointing; like the gameplay is not super satisfying; you're basically just taking over parts of maps just like you would in Ubisoft, but it's just not as fun; the stealth isn't as good; the gunplay is not as good; um, and then there's these characters, and the characters just suck, and that was like the one thing is like there's memorable",

I think even from that point, because it makes sense why the embargo was one - it makes sense that the games weren't really given out early, very early. It makes sense that no one really knew anything about the game. This game just... I think that they produced and I don't think it's Daybreak Game Company's fault; I don't think it's really anyone's fault per se.

The thing about Doom is that it's a game from a bygone era of Shooters because Shooters take themselves way more seriously now and it's not that Doom doesn't take itself seriously, because I don't really feel like the original Doom was supposed to be sarcastic like Wolfenstein was supposed to be sarcastic. We have to remember that the same studio made these games; um, Wolfenstein was definitely over the top and silly but Wolfenstein has important DNA because it's really the first first-person shooter and Doom was the one that really took it to a bigger scale, but I don't necessarily think it was supposed to be facetious.

The game's fidelity is really fine now; a lot of the guys who really made the original games are obviously gone, I mean, probably all of them at id Software, but id's all about fidelity, and I think that you know they kind of lost the plot with Rage for a lot of people - like Rage was all about um, and I liked Rage, but but Rage was they were like, \"Look how good it runs,\" and look how like all these things, and they're like, \"But yeah, but like it's just not fun,\" and I think that with Doom it's like, \"Well, look how good it runs,\" and it's Doom, it's the classic Doom that you understand and that you love, full of demons.",

That was such an awesome moment when you rip yourself off the table and you go over there and you see the suit and you put on the suit - that's really cool. And like, I don't even have a real soft spot for Doom, but I love Doom 2; I played a lot of Doom 2 back in the day. But it's the one that... yeah, I think like that's not one that's never going to get played again by me. I will get back to that when I'm like, you know what? I just want to mess around for a few hours and kill stuff. Yeah, I really wish I wasn't so head-down in a Kinda Funny live, 'cause like Doom looks like the perfect game for me right now after Ratchet and then Uncharted - this is what I want. It's just a fun shooter, so hopefully you know, a couple weeks I'll get back to it, 'cuz it doesn't seem like it's that long, so no it's",
