            "text": "Greetings and salutations everyone welcome to another Kinda Funny Let's Play with Nick Scarpino, of course, playing a game that is very near and dear to my heart, and I hope it holds up to my high expectations of it Doom. Uh, this game doesn't really need any sort of uh introduction; it's been around since the dawn of time, really. Um, I remember specifically playing this game back when I was in I think seventh grade. My band director, my junior high band director, Mr. Usher gave me Doom on like 18 floppy discs, and I just had to keep installing it because it was like once you played it once, you know what I mean? Crack! Let's Jump Right In. Ah ah, it's definitely got that Doom style, that good metal style. Let's make sure the settings are good, gravy, and let's just jump right in. I'm too going to die. Oh, that's awesome. Lot of lot of good subtle nods to the to the original here. Let's go hurt me plenty, just like I tell my Doom damn, that was a dark quote. I don't even know what.",

I like the story really kind of uh sheds a lot of light on the first Doom uh while you were there and what was going on there so far really kind of enlightening. No idea if it fits in canon or if this is a reimagining of Doom, have to imagine it's probably a little remake. And be did I get everything? Oh God, find the blue access key, look I found it either that or it's a very small alien, are you an alien? No, going through these creepy ass catacombs how do I get up there?
