Uh, played a little bit last night and then put another hour in this morning. So, you know, I have not played a ton of it. Uh, but my first impression is really impressive, and like I said, I think they've made a better one of these kind of games\u2014a better Team Fortress 2 in my view, sure. Uh, from the limited time I've played it, see it's the grind that scares me about it. That was what for like The Division when I hit level 30 was like the big thing for me: oh, I'm done with this because I saw like the fact that okay, cool, and now we're to the point where if I want to get the most out of this, I need a squad, I need people I roll with every night, and this is all we play.

Um, but yeah, I think that OverWatch will have a pretty good-sized audience for some time to come, it seems like a pretty safe bet really uh, and not just because it's Blizzard - I know they seem to you know, like Blizzard has its fans, they have their own convention, you know uh so people go nuts for Blizzard stuff no matter what. But uh, I think that there is some quality to this game, there's quite a lot uh, and a Blizzard level of quality even so.

The numbers are huge; it's doing it's doing what I mean, it's it's on one hand, I feel for those guys for kind of shipping into this window where yeah, I mean, you have Epic with a more traditional shooter, MOBA with Paragon, and then you know Overwatch is taking its shine too. But also, I don't know how much you guys have played, but I just think Battleborn's a bad game, really regardless of when it shipped; uh, like that game doesn't feel good, uh, it doesn't look great, the situational awareness is really low - like just kind of across the board.

But yeah, it's uh, yeah, it's the fact that these bets are made years ahead of time. You saw this payoff with Ubisoft-style checkbox games, you saw this with open-world games, and you're still seeing the kind of remnants of that. And what I think what the developers had to have been smart enough in the publishers specifically maybe two years ago to be like, \"We're too late on this bet; we need to figure out like what the next bet is.\" It's the same thing that happened with the race to the bottom on mobile almost.

Is it a massive, almost I feel like maybe the next thing that people want to get involved with 18 months ago at the embryonic state is something like a very ambitious The Witcher 3-style open-world game or whatever, where you know, it's very quest-based and very huge and very loot-driven. Because I feel like there's just too many of these games. You're right, but at the same time, like The Witcher isn't going to sell hats forever, you know?
