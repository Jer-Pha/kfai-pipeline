It's destroyed our family because of the nature of my family. Basically everyone is at each other's throats. I'm trying to cover all the costs to reel everyone in, and it's been difficult. Uh, this is from Chris, of course, he had reached out originally with this topic because he wanted to surprise his family, his mom, to go to the GoFundMe site to support her treatment. She has since passed away, so the GoFundMe site is turned into a memorial for his mom to pay for bills or services and everything else. So of course we encourage you if you can to go throw a few bucks that way. But this is one of those things I think about all the time because I'm getting older, which means then I'll stop and be like, \"Oh no, my parents are getting older.\" What's going to happen when inevitably something bad happens? You know what I mean, and I don't mean like a shark attack. I mean they get old.",

I had cancer, but you know when one of those events happens for them, what's my reaction? I assume it's that I'm going to have to tear up stakes and go out there for as long as it takes. But what if it is like my cancer was, right where it's a six-month process? I don't know how I'm going to deal with that now in terms of how I deal with it emotionally. I would handle it very much the same way Brian's doing with his mom - throwing himself into his work, into comedy, but into IGN being public about it, right because that's all we know how to do; that's who we are.\" Sorry, you threw me off when you said your parents might die of a shark attack in Lake Superior or wherever the heck Michigan is.
