The first day is going to be a completely ridiculous stage show; what we have planned this year completely blows last year out of the water, and I don't even know how that's possible because we were really stupid last year, and this year's somehow even stupider. Day two is going to be a full day of meet and greets; we're hanging out with all of us, a bunch of Rooster Teeth people are there, Funhaus people are there, Achievement Hunter it's going to be a grand old time; there's going to be some games to play, there's going to be signings; it's it's exciting, it's a really fun time; there's going to be exclusive merch. Oh yeah, there's definitely going to be exclusive merch. Go to KindaFunny.com/tix to get your tickets today; there's a couple VIP tickets still available, so make sure if you want one of those, you act fast. Second topic of the day Colin, I want to talk about Resident Evil; you got some stuff for me? Yeah, well, so there was",

Yeah, well, so there was just a passing mention in Capcom's financials that they were planning something with Resident Evil - at least that's what people have been reading into it. So, what they basically said, in short, wasn't very long, what they said to begin with was they have a full-fledged offense for Res Evil plan for the second half of the year. And what a lot of people are reading into that is that they're going to announce and release the game, Resident Evil 7, or a new Resident Evil. Greg and I both think it's not going to be Resident Evil 7; it'll be like a reboot. Um, but we'll see what ends up happening, and that makes sense because Capcom has been messing around with Resident Evil for a while now - like Res Evil 6 was very lukewarmly received at critical and",

Res Evil 5 less so, but wasn't really a Res Evil game; people really look back at Res Evil 4 as the last true Resident Evil game, um, survival horror Res Evil game. And you know they released a remake HD last year, a little before this time was probably like 14 or 15 months ago, and then they released Res Evil Zero HD. Um, and then they announced that they're going to remake Resident Evil 2, and then they re-released Res Evil 6 on current gen platforms, and then they're going to release Res 5 on those platforms; that's all going to culminate with Res Evil 4 coming to these platforms if I remember correctly.

I think along the way Resident Evil became such a big franchise and such a big everybody knew what Resident Evil was that it had to keep evolving because it couldn't just be all right Mansion City, you know it just kept like getting bigger and bigger. It's like kind of like when you look at Mario, it's like you go from Super Mario World to Super Mario Galaxy, what's next? And it's like you need to feel this sense of progression. And it hit a point in the early 2000s probably when the movie started coming out, well Resident Evil was action, it just became action and that's you make things bigger, it's just just action. And it's like those movies perform so well, I'm sure that influenced the games because shooters are starting to get big Call",

I want it to be there's been a zombie outbreak and we're trying to contain it and that's what and how does this all spiral out and there's Intrigue and story and characters that make sense and Wesker's back or whatever but he's a new Wesker because it's a reboot and his motivations make sense and understand where we're going with it.

Is the fact that I'm just an engineer, holy ****, what do I do, and I'm using my, I'm augmenting my guns to fix the ship to shoot the **** limbs off of things, and everything that came at me was terrifying.
