I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. I would say it's good to be here with you today, but then I'd be telling the truth. It's good to be here with you today. Oh, you threw me a curveball, Colin. Got up on the right side of the bed today? Well, one can say that. One could also say that they got up on the right side of the bed. Uh, no matter which side they get up on the bed because it's a mentality now. What if your bed's up against the wall? I know there's only one side to get out on. You could technically get out on two sides. What if it's like into an inlet though?

I think Jack Tretton, hosting the show, are you going to do anything with the other things that you got like I just alluded to? He should have opened the show unless editing failed for some reason, but I can't imagine. And uh, so I thought that was fun to reiterate. And uh, obviously, you know, rapping with Megan was a lot of fun. I don't think people expected that Mike Dreher came out; Ker was fantastic. Tone De was fantastic. Bernie Burns did a great job as founder Rooster Teeth obviously did a great job hosting. Um, people seem to enjoy the merch; they enjoyed each other. The venue was great.

It's a shotgun approach - put it up, this just went up like what it is. Because Clion (corrected from \"Clen\") is in there, taking up all his proofreading time. The smash-hit horror game on PlayStation 4, he loves it so much he can't stop playing it, so he says. And as I sit and play it now, and as I watch playtesters every day, I can finally let myself get excited - we're actually doing this. However, as we approached our final deadlines, we realized that some key moments needed extra polish to bring them up to our standards. I have had to make the tough choice to delay the game for a few weeks to allow us to deliver something special.

The universe of No Man's Sky is incredibly vast \u2013 more than you can imagine. This is a type of game that hasn't been attempted before by a smaller team than anyone would expect under an intense amount of expectation.

So they're releasing these kind of variety of games and becoming a very like very robust publisher of games, but their home studio I think is actually not their weak link but the one that needs a shakeup the most, you know.

They dumbed down the RPG elements of the game just like they did in Mass Effect, not them, BioWare did Mass Effect, but the same thing happened in this series. Um, that un-RPGs them in a lot of ways and I just think that you have to kind of go in the opposite direction.

Sword Coast Legends trophies are up which would be interesting of course. Sword Coast Legends is being made by a developer that is closed, Obsidian Entertainment. They announced that they were closing on March 29th, 2016. They were founded in 1994 by Chris Roberts and later John R.

They did; they definitely did. Never happened. You made it up. No, I got killed in the Dark Zone. Dark Zone. You're a big fan of The Division over here. Division. Hey, I played The Division for 40 hours. Don't give me any crap; it's been a while. I played it all within like a week though. Um, yeah. I couldn't go in there without getting **** up.

That's a great game, it is one of few JRPGs Sony made at the time, along with Wild Arms and the Legend of Dragoon. I just love the game's battle system; it's like a mixture of turn-based and fighting game. I remember as a kid experimenting with combos and was so delighted when I would discover a super art accidentally. I haven't played anything like it since except for the sequel on the PS2, which isn't, I feel, as good sadly. I never got to finish the game because I got a corrupted memory card and deleted all my progress. I hope someday to finish the original if it ever becomes available on PSN thanks Aaron AKA Monkey yeah so I was gonna say I see what he's saying first of all Legend of Dragoon is a **** awesome game for people that haven't played Legend of Dragoon, he did a pretty good job of explaining it is a mid-generation PS1",
