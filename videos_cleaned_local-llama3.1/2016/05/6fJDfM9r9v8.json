I have some charcoal gray shirts that count as heather, you know they're not traditional heathering, yeah. My wife, it's kind of an inside joke to my wife cuz she likes it as well so half of our closet is Heather Gray but we have to separate them otherwise I might mix one up and wear her shirts and she's significantly smaller than me it would be but it would look good cuz you have the ice cream Scoops I'm always talking about there they are oh look at them go there over there, The Pure One Tim Gettys some Rocky Road I like Rocky Road oh wow okay okay I'll take that I was thinking Pringles and cream rounding out the group of course the pride of Long Island Colore\"",

No, but one young woman, named Sarah Carpenter wrote us a message and she said she had a boyfriend who's turning 21 years old, his name is Prince Barutzki. Now, you realize, a real Prince.

No, probably not the band The Carpenters; no, definitely not my boss, the Jewish Carpenter. Uh, everyone's related to him somewhere. Do you think that he's related to Prince at all, the musician?

Emily Rose is a real actress who does real shows and movies, whereas North is a voice actor in Moab. Yeah, remember she came out of acting school; this was like her first gig, and then she got her TV show and everything else. I'm with you; my main thing is like, and I love Emily \u2013 this isn't a knock against Emily. What are we worried about the Hollywood ageism stuff? Are we worried at all about that in 10 years, is she going to be like... what are we casting El?
