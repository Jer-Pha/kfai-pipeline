I think that in terms of you know, so I kind of put these things together like implied sex, like I think there was like implied sexed into a degree and even Final Fantasy IV and V on the NES or just like love kind closeness with some characters whatever but I don't really see it you know with with sprites forever like that.

It's just like I just... I don't. I'm not trying to be a prude at all in that respect. It's just like in fiction, I think the implication is usually way more powerful than showing it. Like, a great example is Uncharted with Chloe and Drake - the first time they have sex, they're like, can we crawl on top of her? At our top of him, and then the camera pans away. And I'm like, that's like great, that's sure that tells me as much as I need to know. As if you were showing them rolling around for five minutes, like why... I never really in fiction get uncomfortable sometimes where do you come from? Massive sex scenes, then like they're still very cool.

Mm-hmm. So anyway, that's a kind of a ramp, but I'm glad it hasn't been as prominent in games as it has been in movie and television. I just don't see how it adds anything. Sex is important, love is important, but seeing it is like kind of gratuitous. I do think I agree with Greg on that it's uh it's contextual and can add I think the TV show examples Game of Thrones a lot of it is unnecessary, but I do think sometimes it does add to the context of the story and stuff. I think God of War is a good example, it's very graphic and unnecessary, like that's kind of the point, like it's",

It takes oh I feel like it's like almost a fictional cop-out when you show it as opposed to like you're wasting time, you need to waste five minutes wherever so you show it, it's a graphic sex scene, you know my under sitting your kind uncomfortable in my chair in the movie they're like wanting to see some actual story and some conflict there's some dialogue or something with",

In which... yeah, I didn't play them but I know quite a bit about that game. You know, that's kind of sexist, although I don't agree with the charges that The Witcher 3 made. Everyone's like \"The Witcher 3 is sexist\" and did you see the Chinese Room tweet? Yeah, about the Chinese Room, makers of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and Dear Esther, they tweeted out when CD Projekt RED showed a picture of Cyberpunk 2077 of a cyborg woman in lingerie and stockings.

There's a very fine line between it being awesome and being additive, and it being cringe-worthy, and I think that more often than not you're going to fail at that stuff. But it's the equivalent of like large-scale battles with stuff \u2013 there's a lot of times you see in shows or movies or anything they just on the budget for it so they'll kind of cop out and do like a quick version, and that's 99% the time more effective than them attempting to actually do the actual fight because they couldn't do that right.
