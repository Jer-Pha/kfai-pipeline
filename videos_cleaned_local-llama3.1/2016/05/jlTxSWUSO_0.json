Ryan Moroski says, \"What do you think Rocksteady is up to now? Did they go make a new IP?\" Good question. Oh, that's a great question. Yeah, I bet they're still... I bet they're doing... They'll do another licensed game. I think that they saw what worked with Batman; they saw the critical acclaim; they saw the millions of fans, and I think",

I bet they're still working on another licensed game, I think that they saw what worked with Batman: Arkham - they saw the critical acclaim and millions of fans, and I think they want to keep going with that. I'm sure WB is still trying to get them to pick up something, and I'm sure because when you let a developer finish their trilogy, ignoring the origins that weren't theirs, let them finish that. I'm sure WB's like, \"What's next? What do you want to do? Do you want to take on this character? Do you undo this? Do you want to do Justice League? Do you want to do a Batman Beyond game, which is my dream come true?\" But there are so many different things. I would still say they're gonna be doing a comic book game, a licensed game. Yeah, I would agree. The thing though is that they have a lot of license to do whatever they want now. So um, there are people.",

I mean it would still be a great game, yeah. It just wasn't as good as Asylum and especially City. I think like that game, no one even talked about that game after like two months, like it wasn't in the Game of the Year discussion at all. I think they have something to prove. I think they overthought that game. I think that it's clear that they felt like they had to change too much and they didn't have to change much at all to make it good because their production value is so high, the writing is so on point, it's just like they need to go back to the basics.",

Sure, it does simultaneously feel like both. And I think that the games\u2014it's a little harder with because the gameplay needs to also do that as well as a story. But I think that if you take two franchises, like I think I'm charted in Tomb Raider actually; it's like the perfect example of that totally just works. But I think that you can take two franchises' stories and give it a totally new type of gameplay so that people aren't like, \"You know, comparing it to one side or the other.\" But it's a new type of game with the story elements of the other two.

But like the one that always stands out to me is from freshman year of college - I'm across the hall in my friend John's room playing WWE SmackDown Too on PlayStation 1, which was right after Smackdown! Here Comes the Pain on PS2, I believe.

Ryan Ver El says, \"Why can't a company like Disney succeed in the video game industry? Move there's none specialized and if I don't think... I think you have to be all in.\" I mean what do you think about the company is the publishers at do succeed their publishers the video games they don't do other things like Activision does anything else.

We'll get all of the Batman's, that's how they'll go around to doing it \u2013 we'll get Arkham City, Arkham Knight, Arkham Asylum.

Do they have their own special box or they come in a bland secret box? Mm-hmm. Depends nowadays it's codes; the industry's changed mostly to where you just get codes for games and that's on retail is running on retail part of it - I don't know if it was this shift of this generation as much as it was our shift as well, but it seems like it's always retail.
