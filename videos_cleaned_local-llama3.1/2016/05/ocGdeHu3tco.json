You see this report that like it's way worse for kids to use because their faces are right there getting all the stuff blown back in their faces. Dumb kids. Dumb design. Because I was impressed just by maybe not the cleanliness but the dryness factor. They do the blade, they're better than like the stupid Hand Dryer way. I don't want that, but I hate hand dryers. Can I just use the paper and like they try to do it now where they'll like hide the paper towels in the other side of the bathroom? Like I don't care. I'm going to go get it now.

Doesn't it work like The Division with mods, where you can take two low-level ones and get a medium level one, and then take two medium ones and get a high level? It's a little similar also the rerolling - I'm not crazy about it. You use like these materials to roll and you can get a better or worse statistic every time. I did it and got worse, so I'm just like, 'I don't know.' I think the system is alienating gameplay is fun and I think this leveling up's fun and the weapons and all that kind of stuff, but the subsystems are a little half-baked to be perfectly honest with you.

Battlefield 1 quote will focus on different stories and different personalities across the world end quote. And the game will strive to at least partially highlight some lesser-known people and events etc from World War I including playing as a Bedouin, I think you say that woman during uh part of the game as well as a Harlem Hellfighter who was shown on the cover of the game um so World War I a bold place to place a game.",

But my first-person shooter threshold is so low in terms of interest. What gets me interested to go out and play a first-person shooter? Doom's different, right. Doom's back. Battlefield has been around forever, but if it is going to be more personal stories, more interesting characters, more cool things happening...

There would be no World War II without World War I, obviously. They're basically the same war in a lot of ways but um there's a lot of geopolitical and just political and social complications throughout the war on different sides and a lot of different belligerence in the war including us. Um, so I am interested to see how they weave that story because I guess what I'm saying is unlike a World War II game where it's like uh the Americans land in Normandy, they march in through France into the Netherlands into Belgium down in Germany and take Berlin or whatever and that's the path; World War I's way more complicated.",

Nonetheless, Capcom notes that the game is still selling steadily and that it's still a fan favorite. I think they'll be fine. Sony's probably mitigating some of this cost as well since they publish the game. Um, but it's funny that they had a very bold and bullish 2 million copies in the first two months, and they've reached 1.4 million, and it seems like it's shipped not sold.

The gameplay in those games feels clunky as hell to me, which I'm surprised has never bothered Colin, being such a huge fan of gameplay.

Yeah, like I've known it for a long time. Whole pack TW out, like some like some false like 2019 release, a joke clearly.

Oh, very interesting. I really liked the combat with the steel rod that you had, that you got different attack SL upgrades with and the cloud you used for hovering over water. The game reminded me of Uncharted without guns. Monkey and Trip were cool main characters; Trip was an AI female partner similar to Elena in the sense that she would explore the game during the game, that she would... I'm sorry, she was with you during the game, and you ran through many beautiful environments to explore. The platform game was very beautiful. Should have received a sequel for sure. I feel Enslaved is a really interesting one, that's a good pick for sure. Great game, and actually if you remember, it came out before Last of Us, but when I was playing The Last of Us, I was like, \"Oh, this kind of feels like Enslaved,\" cuz they were far-future but",

Yours truly is 15 years old, and Catherine is a mere week away from release, and I've just picked up a PS3 to play it after loving the Persona games on PS2. As I boot up the system, I am met with the message: 'Do you want to create a PSN ID?' Of course, I think to myself, what could possibly go wrong? In a moment of weakness, I sign up to the PlayStation Network, and my name is none other than Spinter UnCore Monkey Swinter Monkey. It's not until two months later that I realized that my mistake is irreversible, and I am stricken down to the depths of hell where I meet by Shuhei Yoshida. He stares at me with his beady hellish eyes and says, 'Any last words, mortal?' I reply, 'Shut up, you monster! Let us change our names!' Love you guys, Crack Addicted Dog CCT",

Oh yeah, totally. I was Bugs. I don't like that grown-up only. Only Grandma Miller who fought the sickly raccoon was the one who called me Gregory. Everybody else called me Bugs, and it would stop when like kindergarten. I remember it being a big deal that like are you're going to go there and you're going to be Greg? You need to like write Gregory, you can't write Bugs, you're Gregory, you're Greg, you weren't right in anything. I would no in kindergarten. I don't know what I did.

They used to come out of lockers and tell jokes. I thought that would be hilarious, and I got in trouble for it, of course. Because school sucks. If you're listening, kids, just drop out of school. Uh, but I, I don't not give good advice. You have a chance, I think, to give your kid a nickname, and have it be... I mean, don't do like the whole thing we have with XPac or X or whatever over on Don't do stupid stuff like that. Don't be like I mean you're I'm you're already SP Rex is driving his car, and I be like Nintendo is good right, like that's a good one already.
