No, you're gonna bring it up, you're gonna bring it up to the level of conversation now, trans rights. Mmm topical thing last Friday as of this recording, the White House put out an executive order that any public school that didn't let students that I did didn't let students go to the bathroom that they identify as will have public funding pulled. So this very quickly became a point of contention in my little town of Iowa. We are all hippies, you said you owe me Satan stuff, it's it's very split, it's either you're a hippie or a Roux, as we call them Roo Roo first short for guru okay okay oh my god like your town a lot I just want you to know that sounds very relaxing so it's except the trigger boys about to bring cap I will be I will be wherever I want there is no **** state law I peed in the women's bathroom sometimes",

I think it's going to take a little bit of time and a little bit of education and as I said on the other side, a little bit of patience, you know, just a little bit of patience and everything's gonna be fine.

That's my question about that. Like, it does not hurt you; it doesn't affect you. Get off right?
