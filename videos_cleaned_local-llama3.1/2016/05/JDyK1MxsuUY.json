Colin, what's your topic? I want to talk about Colin and Greg Live, which is our morning show on Twitch. We've been doing it since the day we launched in January fifth 2015 - pretty much every weekday. We've missed that, I would say cumulatively probably 20-25 days in that time with the exception of the two weeks we took off for PAX East. So there's a pretty consistent product actually most consistent product in terms of like airtime I'd say it's five six seven hours a week and I wanted to kind of",

Are we were talking, I like the bandwidth is full right, like we have no more bandwidth, but are we making a mistake by not putting more time, effort, and thought into that show in particular? And do you agree with the assessment of this learned gentleman that this show might have way more untapped potential than almost anything else we do? We just kind of do it, and a lot of that's on me, obviously. I mean, it's my show; it's our show, Greg. In my show, but is there some... where do you see the show growing? Do you see the shows changing because basically the impetus that I wanted for this particular conversation was I was thinking about going to the audience and being like, what do you want the show to be?

And what we've noticed is that the numbers have gone down from, like, 5 or 4 thousand to 25 to 3,000, but the show is way more profitable; we get like tons of tips, so like, and subscribers. So that the numbers are kind of versus where the actual viewers daily viewers have gone down with the money that we make off the show, and all the practical things that we need to worry about in the business are actually way up. So what's it you guys think on this, having both coasts of the show, and also doing the show without us? Right? I'm curious like what your thoughts are on this, and if it would be a wise play for us to go to the audience now in this video or in the few in the near future and be like, \"What do we make this show?\" Because it was modeled after",

Yes, I kind of like that's what makes me like doing it, so I don't want to get up and do like... I was wondering if we make it 60 minutes, we have segments, do we like to have everything in it? So it begins this, and then it goes into this, and then it ends with this. Am I guess kind of boring you know? But maybe that's what people want, maybe that's why the numbers have gone down. But then would it be more profitable? Yeah, so I personally like the show, but I wanted our normal shenanigans right, like...

And I think all that's built on a foundation of four guys who actually have been strong in their knowledge for the industry, especially for games - but once you get that out of the way, I personally just like it when the show goes off the rails.

We just did it, and Shelby was recognized it's so much together that we were like, \"We know exactly what we're doing.\" We brought on the same page, and the show in my mind is kind of like my vision for it in a way. It would work better. So, in one way, I'm great proud of it because I'm like this is easily the most profitable thing we do for time spent on it. Like, the show makes quite a lot, I don't think it is though. I think then that's where my take is on the whole thing.

And so like, for me, I don't know, like I don't I don't know what I'm supposed to make this into. Because part of going back to what my friend was telling me is like this show has significant untapped potential. But it seems like it needs structure. And to me, I'm like structures good because it was modeled after shows that have significant structures are on TV or on the radio. You can't just like **** do whatever you want for any old sub tale be 45 minutes tomorrow be an hour and a half, like that's possible.

I listen to it as my cousin doesn't watch the show anymore, so um I think part of it is going to be collaborating with the ideas of some sort of structure like making it an hour, choosing only five news stories or something a day, the most five important things to talk about, totally aping what PTI does and putting a clock on the board that forces us to only read the story and talk about it for a minute.

No, I said it's exactly the opposite direction.

It's just like I can't ignore the data that's been given to us - more money, fewer viewers. What's more relevant? You know, viewer drop-off is forty to thirty-five percent or so.
