The first day is going to be a completely ridiculous stage show but we have planned this year, and it completely blows last year out of the water. I don't even know how that's possible because we were really stupid last year, and this year's somehow even stupider. Day two is going to be a full day of meet and greets; we're hanging out with all of us, a bunch of Rooster Teeth people are there, Funhaus people are there, Achievement Hunter it's going to be a grand old time. There's going to be some games to play, there's going to be signings; it's it's exciting, it's a really fun time. There's going to be exclusive merch. Oh yeah, this is definitely going to be exclusive merch. Go to KindaFunny.com/tix to get your tickets today. There's a couple of VIP tickets still available, so make sure if you want one of those, you act fast. What's up guys, welcome to the first ever episode 70 of the Kinda Funny Gamescast I'm a little sad that we've moved",

It's been a long time coming. Yeah, now you can finally grow up; you can stop making all these jokes about it. See, now that I don't know, like some people are suggesting that Season One of the Gamescast is now over, so now we start over with another episode one. But then I'm like, \"Episode 1\" - I've been **** up since the first and last ever for a while. But uh, you know, I liked that idea; it was a good idea. So welcome to the first... no, I'm not going to do that; I'd get confused. I would do it, but somewhere along the line, I'm going to get really **** up. Every episode should just be episode 691, 692 - there you go. That's another way to do it. It'll be like a Square Enix naming this show and it'll be great exactly.

And I think that's like for me it was interesting to watch it last night happen, and be 'cause at first my knee-jerk reaction coming from the Lego Dimensions Camp was like \"oh man, that sucks\" - and this I mean like the shock of it was like \"ah, that sucks\" but it'll be cool to get Star Wars and Marvel and all of them into Lego Dimensions right because they already have that.",

Are we seeing the ceiling or was it just Disney being like, \"This isn't an investment for us.\" Yeah, well, I think it's interesting to note that Disney is just not making games period anymore. So it's not just Infinity; they're just straight up like, \"We out.\" You know? Uh, I think that that obviously says a lot. That like, it's not necessarily that they weren't making money; they weren't making enough money, I think is the key thing. And I think that it's obvious when you look at the franchises that they have, like Marvel, Star Wars, and just Disney and Pixar. Like, those alone, it's like come on, you don't really get much bigger than that.

Yeah, there's a million Princess Peaches. Um, and then Disney Infinity - there's stocked Lego Dimensions stocked Skylanders now has a really tiny little kiosk, and it's like it looks like there's just a **** ton of them left. Yeah, I think that so my take on this is... the word is that Disney ate **** on Disney Infinity, so that's number one: they didn't make any money on it; they lost about $150 million, according to the Wall Street Journal writer - that's basically the budget of three Triple-A games that they lost on Disney Infinity. So they either weren't selling or what I think is more likely is that the upfront investment in doing these games is way higher, obviously because...\"",
