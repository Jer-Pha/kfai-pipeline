Topic two: we're talking about EA; we're talking about Star Wars Battlefront; we're talking about it not having a campaign over on GameSpot. Eddie speaking during EA's investor Day event, EA Studios' boss Patrick S\u00f6derlund talked about how Star Wars Battlefront, while generally well received, was criticized for its lack of a single-player campaign. He also teased that a future installment might include a campaign. He started off by explaining it was a purposeful decision to leave out a campaign for Battlefront in part so that the team at DICE would get it out in time for the",

Additionally, it makes sense that EA would want to get the game out in time for the film while Battlefront was overall his success shipping over 14 million copies. Suin said he's not pleased with the 75 score it has on Metacritic: \"The one thing that we get criticized on was the lack of a single-player campaign. It was a conscious decision we made due to time and being able to launch the game side by side with the movie that came out to get the strongest possible impact. I think the team created a really good game based on the premise that we had. I'd say the game was done very well for us and reached a very different demographic than a traditional",

So all right, what do you guys take from this? Um, this is I remember when when Battlefront came out we talked about it and I remember I remember talking about watching GameOverGreggy play the game um and my original thought as they said was this is a **** w that like they built this you know the I guess Frostbite engine or whatever is this game's running on, a beautiful DICE engine it looks it looks awesome, the the the Gunplay is great, the worlds are beautifully realized and you have to play it online and like that I was like that sucks that just sucks but you know what like 14 million copies of a game makes it one of the best selling games of the year easily um last",

Kevin and I were you know talked about in color live today, like \"Have you still playing it?\" He's like, \"No,\" but I'd like to get back to it one day, and that's how I feel. It is one of those games where if all of a sudden they dropped... if all of a sudden on the same day, same Tuesday, on the PlayStation 4, some awesome expansion came out for Star Wars - that's just you know multiplayer only, and some awesome expansion came out in The Division. I would have such a better chance of playing Star Wars because I know I can just jump in and go. I'm going to jump in and be right there with every... some people have better guns than me, but it won't be the end of the world.",

The I'm like, no, did you do this pre-mission before? It's like, no, you don't know if that's what it is. Star Wars Battlefront, I think was a success. I think most people look back at it and say, \"Oh, that was a fun game\" if they played it. If they didn't play it, I think it is that they're hung up on the single-player campaign, which is totally fair and fine. But I don't think it's in the Titanfall sense of this multiplayer only game where history has forgotten it. And I think of Titanfall, and I'm like, yeah, I did enjoy Titanfall for that month.

It's like that's all he wanted out of that experience, which is what a lot of people I'm sure want that experience. Yeah, so they're supposed to be getting another one this year, right?

But I mean, that's kind of just how this all works. But that's the weird thing right?

I'm not throwing shade in any respect to Dark Souls; it's just those numbers are in my mind. Where Battlefront having been out six months against a series that is beloved by core gamers outsold it even though people had all of these complaints about it. So it's, and it's a Star Wars game, and it has commercials. I'm not saying that all things are created equal; all I'm saying is that context is really important. 14 million copies is a **** a lot, and even if even if half of those people like the game a lot, they're in great shape for the sequel. But I do think it's you know there's some confusion with what EA is going to do with Star Wars, that's why I think it's somewhat of a strategic error that they didn't have some sort of B-tier or single A-tier Star Wars game attached to the movie that",

And then Visceral's Heritage of narrative-driven games, and I doubt that Visceral's game will have an online component at all. So um they have like these voids filled with the Star Wars licenses pretty well. And I - one cool thing, and one thing I credit EA for is that they're at least putting quality first. Like Battlefront was in no way shape or form anything but a good game; it's just not my kind of game. And I do think that it was a waste - like having seen how beautiful that battle of Hoth was for instance, how chaotic it was.
