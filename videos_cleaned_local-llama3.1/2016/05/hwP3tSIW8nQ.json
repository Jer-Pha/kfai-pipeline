Colin, what have you been playing recently on that there PlayStation? Odin Sphere Leifthrasir. I have no idea how to pronounce it; I've never heard anyone actually say it so I don't know. It sounds right, like the game \"Rogue Trooper.\" Remember that LOF (or Lof) trousers game where you played in like the LV basically? It's a port of the PS2 classic, the very late PS2 release Odin Sphere, but with some new bells and whistles. It's a remaster, right? Yeah, it looks great; it looked great to begin with. Let's be clear: 100% this is one of those things about Odin SP that how much I like playing it on PS2 and how obsessed M was when I first came to IGN. It was one of those games that got there; we were all playing it. It was it was one of the last gasps of the PlayStation 2 as well, right? Because the PlayStation 3 was already out then it.",

It goes on like this - you understand very late the art book; you see all this stuff, you see all these beautiful characters. Some of them are buxom, that happens occasionally with a vanilla we game, an action RPG. Velvet here is talking about Destiny over all this stuff. Uh, you've been playing it, Col. What do you think Odin Sphere? I love it; I mean, it's a great game. Uh, it's uh, you know, it has that spirit of the Vanillaware games - the hack-and-slash kind of thing. If you've played um, Muramasa, if you've played obviously Dragon's Crown, I mean these are very familiar kinds of games. They make very similar kinds of games; not only in the art style, obviously the art style is indicative of Dragon's Crown, obviously it's you know, it's the same same kind of game earlier game uh but it's a fantastic game. I think it it holds up; I think a lot of games like that that are not too complicated mechanically but have deep systems.",

Cool, do you want any of these things? Uh, I'll probably take the PS4 game okay, I think we have codes for that, I'll probably take it. Well, why don't we put this all into a live prize box on twitch.tv/kindafunnygames, we give stuff away. I think I'm going to take all of it actually no, well all right maybe some of it will be there maybe some of it won't but you don't know.
