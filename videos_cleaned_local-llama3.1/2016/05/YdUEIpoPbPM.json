Then it was with Mass Effect, and then it was with Uncharted, yep. And now it's just a normal thing, yeah. Which which is kind of unfortunate, I mean like Rings of Power was correct by yeah. Um so to like I kind of feel this way in cinema too, like in movies and TV, like I'm watching The Americans right now, and uh which is fine, it's a show that takes place in the 80s about Soviet spies but like it's very hypersexual and like I don't see like I've never really seen an example in fiction of where like showing graphic sex or showing like the act as opposed to implying or whatever ever adds to the story ever.

Where do you come down on Mass Effect sex scenes? Then like they're they're cool, the flirtation and the figuring out who you can be with - Mass Effect is way more fun than the awkwardness of like the different camera angles welcome to real life, Colin. Yeah, Chase is always better than the actual act. But so to me, like I I I'm I don't see that it's penetrated gaming as much as uh as much as it has you know film and television but I'm even seeing it in America where I'm like this is kind of uncomfortable - why do I why do I need to see this ****? Like this doesn't it doesn't add to the story, and so to me like sex is very powerful in fiction but it doesn't need and it's super additive but it doesn't need to be seen.

Like, it's often like the guy puts the gun in his head and the trigger pulls, like in The Sopranos, and then the guy like falls to the ground. You don't need to see the bullet going through his head to know what happened, and to have that be like a powerful sort of device. Mhm. So anyway, that's a kind of a rant. But um, I'm glad that it's not been as prominent in games as it has been in movie violence because I just don't see how it adds anything. Sex is important, love is important, but seeing it is like kind of uncomfortable. Yeah, I mean, I do think I agree with you. I think it's uh, it's contextual and it can add...

Well, I don't think there's very powerful women characters exactly. That's the big thing. I mean, you want to level at it the fact you have to go in and talk about who Yennefer is, who Triss is, and what their characters are. It's not that they have sex with them, but that's also if you want to develop the relationship that way.

So maybe the takeaway is that PS4 is finally getting its games. Um, I mean those two games alone justified my PS4 entirely - not that I didn't have great experiences before, but in terms of like exclusive stuff, it's done it's like that is totally worth the investment because they are amazing.

She's such a tomboy, but I love her. Yeah, Yuffie quiet runs the game, I like that as well. What where am I going to go with this one is Tidus? Teddy's also trying to bang people, no he's not.
