And then Christine went to buy a mattress once and I said, \"That's a lot of money for a mattress.\" But Casper's mattresses aren't that expensive. In fact, you can get a twin XL mattress for $500 or a king size for $950. And if you go to casper.com/kindafunny and enter the offer code kinda funny, you get $50 off. Now, you might say, \"What am I getting $50 off of?\" To which I would say, \"A mattress, of course.\" But then I'd remind you that there's two types of amazing technologies in a Casper mattress. There's memory foam, there's latex foam, and they come together like this. And then they go and they become one amazing foam that you sleep on at a good cheap price and get a good night's sleep. That is awesome. And wouldn't you like a good night's sleep? Go to casper.com/kindafunny. Enter the offer code kinda funny and you will sleep better on your Casper mattress,",

I got to be honest with you is that I was watching Jedi recently and he really does go out like a **** Like like I got to just admit that that Boba Fett really does.

I guess they were like, you got to go out like a star So, go blow lines and die for a while. It's weird that they killed him at all. It would have been better if Mystique had been way better. It would have been cooler if he fell into the Sarlacc pit and then jetpacked out or something like that. Isn't that what they did in the EU? In in the books, he does he does they he falls out.

A lot of interesting parallels there. Very interesting story about Zachary Taylor in political magazine. People should go read and check out. You're drawing a parallel between him and obviously Hillary Clinton. Exactly. Yes. Because, as I was telling Kevin at lunch, uh, the Republican party first ran a presidential candidate in 1856. John Fremont, the Pathfinder, lost to Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire. The only nickname for Franklin Pierce was \"the man from New.\" He was considered a northerner with southern sensibilities. What is that term? It's like something with dough. John Doe. Judy's dough. Pizza bread. Anyway, it was something people say in the comments. Anyway, in 1856, Franklin Pierce beat him.\n\nNote: I corrected phonetic mistakes (e.g., \"flipflopper\" to \"flip-flopper\"), spelling errors (e.g., \"northerner with southern sensibilities\" is a real phrase), and capitalized proper nouns like names (Zachary Taylor, Hillary Clinton) and places (New Hampshire).",

But shout out to Abraham and shout out to Civil War. But what I'm saying is that the party can collapse very quickly because of Trump and then rise back up. But there's a lot of parallels between Zachary Taylor, I think 1848, no, 1846. I This makes so much sense cuz I've always heard these southern people say, \"We will rise again.\" And they're talking about the Republican party. No, the Democrats were actually the Southerners um and the racists and the slaveholders. Just a little piece of just a little piece of, you know, history.
