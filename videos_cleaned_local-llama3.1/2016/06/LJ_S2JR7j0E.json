There's nothing we can say at this time. Let's just say that we hear that a lot. We love our fans and we certainly want to please them beyond that, we can't say anything at this time. But who knows what the future holds? Marvel games has a lot of things in the works quite a few in the console space that are unannounced. What has been announced is a game to the Marvel Universe from Telltale Games and a new Spider-Man from Insomniac Games or PlayStation 4. What do you guys think? The answer is yes. This goes back to I've said it a lot this past week, but to bring you all up to speed, this goes back to you and I going to see Age of Ultron of that screening and Bill Roseman coming out and being like what's up, I'm in charge of Marvel games here, these are the two other guys who are doing this.

We are out to fix this and make Marvel a force to be reckoned with in the video game industry, the way it is right now in movies as it is on Netflix as it is on TV. And the first was when they announced The Telltale Game, where I was like, \"Oh my God, that's awesome.\" And now they're announcing this Insomniac game and I think it's interesting because Insomniac, for some reason to me, means more than The Telltale one. But they're the same level of... let's take our properties that we care about and give them to the people who make the best kind of games for those things, and this is it. Didn't I didn't understand the connection until Disney Infinity died and they're like, \"We're getting out of this. We're not going to do this anymore.\" And then it",

The analog to him taking games out of the library is taking books out of the library, which has been happening forever - where you could go and buy that book, and you know, great, you get it, money does this, they bank more books, more second editions. I think it's in the same field where if we're if the library is meant to house works of art, you know, pieces of pop culture, whatever, then this is fine.

Does keep on being kind of funny, yeah you risk whenever you go public, you risk hostile takeovers, so that's just inherent; it doesn't often happen but does happen, and if they're taken over by another company, things are obviously going to change for them. Um, I think you'll just have to pay attention to how things change at Activision since that has already been taken over by Vivendi um, you also have to remember that Vivendi was in this space before with Activision and Blizzard right, and in 2011-2012, and they didn't pan out too well for them so um I don't know that they're partners that Ubisoft wants clearly they don't want them but they're going to probably get",
