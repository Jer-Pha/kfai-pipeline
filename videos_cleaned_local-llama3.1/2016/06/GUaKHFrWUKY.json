I was watching that trailer for Independence Day by the way, and and he doesn't say anything like that in the trailer - no, there one he's like \"They're coming, they're like they're back\" or something, but like we're like \"We always knew they were going to come back in the back.\" Oh man, that's all I've got. So Nick, this this might warm your heart a little bit.
