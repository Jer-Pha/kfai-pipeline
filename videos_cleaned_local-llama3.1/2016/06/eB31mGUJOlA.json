God forbid I have to shake hands with some of these people in this industry, and they come to San Francisco, I got to go to dinner, I got to sit down with Dan Aykroyd and talk to him for two hours straight. No, but at a party, I shake his hand, say hey Dan good to see you, and I walk away; I'm like... yeah, I feel like uh, you know, I like to do my one-on-ones, I'm doing some one-ons, you know, my one-on-one sit-downs, my dinners with some people when I'm there.

But but in reality, I just am in a more introverted and reclusive mood, sure. The last few months, um, simply because there's no rhyme or reason to it at all.

Here's the thing about it, and this reminds me a little bit of what was going on in Wolfenstein: The New Colossus, and why I think these games have similar heritages. Both are ID games; now Wolfenstein is obviously not an id game anymore, it's a MachineGames title, but id Software is doing Wolfenstein, sure. But these are like very thoughtful shooters, and what I mean by that is there's reasons you're doing everything in those games. Like so in in Wolfenstein, you're finding you know gold which you know is seemingly meaningless if you want collectibles wherever you're finding Intel for the story, and you're upgrading things in very thoughtful ways, these upgrade skill trees whatever.",

These upgrade skill trees, I think Call of Duty totally aped in the new Call of Duty, and um there's like reasons to maneuver your way through the game in different ways to upgrade your character, and I think Doom takes it like a step further because I was like, \"I have these questions as I'm playing the game. I'm like, 'But why can't I just run through this state? Like, I can just run through all these enemies?' Yeah, and there are parts where you just totally do that, but then the game's like, 'Oh, by the way, we'll give you weapon points if you just kill everything.' Those little things that fill up on the top of your screen the more enemies you kill. I'm like it's a clever solution for me not running through these huge open worlds or uh, you know there's intel that like this the game story is surprisingly",

It seems like there's a lot of communication between id machine games or id was just playing Wolfenstein and got some some tips there. I just am super impressed as I as I noted on Twitter and I think Colin Moriarty noted to me that he also noted yeah that Bethesda is all in on these single-player-centric now Doom has multiplayer but the single-player-centric first-person and",

I can't wait to see how they decide to market it, how they tell you about it, how what it does to the landscape if you want to induce it or introduce one, but that's the same argument I've been making with like uh Xbox One right where they're like there's going to be a smaller Xbox One and then this more powerful Xbox One.

For you, I guess. I just feel like that doesn't make anybody happy. In other words, I mean, it makes people happy who have been waiting to buy one. But if you were waiting to buy one, it's going to be what, an extra $50 bucks, $100 bucks? It's like, well, also three years so six to seven, seven to eight, eight to nine... So summer 2009 was when the Slim PS3 came out, right? That was three years after launch. So I think that it's time as well for a refresh of this console, maybe maybe not. I mean, I think the console's fine as it is. But no, and that's why I and I think that's one of the things about it is the ad is fine how it is. So they really need to worry about that.

So, I don't know, I mean, they're selling PS4s at a profit if you want to really proliferate and make sure that the market reacts positively to the new announcement by not drying up and waiting for the new console. Then you have to have the new console available immediately at an affordable price or you have to have an alternative for them. And I think they just saying like this, PS4 is still on the shelf at the same price, I don't think that's a solution. So we'll see, we'll see.

I think that game will next be seen at TGS next year oh wow um and then maybe they'll have some sort of release information in 2017 for it to come out in the fall 2017 maybe or early 2018 and then you know that game will definitely come out in Japan first so although it's doing so well in the west indicates maybe a global release but that's what I think is going to happen with Persona. But you know, you know I'm hearing I think they would I I don't believe it for Persona they would have said it by now they would have said it at the same time the thing the thing about Persona is that no matter how big it is in the west it's",
