As always, I'm Tim Gettys joined by the coolest dudes in video games Colin Moriarty and Greg Miller. So that sucked, it was awful, man, just an awful conference. Yeah, every they have did themselves from being worse than last year. How did they do that? I think EA's portfolio is too diverse to put into press conferences easily because they do need to spend time on the fact that they're doubling down on this esports business but like, did anyone who who cared about that? Like, and it's well, I talked about it in the pre-show right, and the fact that like we've talked to Adam Boy about how they set up PSX, and there needs to be something three announcements for every person. Da da da, even the announcements here, the ones we were super excited about, we're underwhelming. It's the exact opposite of what Colin was wanting or predicting right, the Mass Effect... and we'll\"",

The Mass Effect here you go, and we'll talk more about it in the fall. It's a cool idea. We're going, you're going Andromeda, you are an alien new species. Nothing really to show, no date to give you. So what this tells me first of all is that with Mass Effect specifically I was super surprised by that. Uh, just tells me the game's not even close to being ready to go. Um, so a significant delay on that. Uh, there's no way that game's coming out I think even anywhere near the first half of 2017 unless they're going to pull some stuff in the fall which is possible, which would be a bit like a move I was saying but I don't know why they would maybe they're going to have their own standalone kind of thing and their own you know thing in October and September or something where they're going to be like\"",

It's pretty clear what's going to happen - the Titan is essentially in being, and at the end will have to let him go into the wild. That's The Story You're Building in the single-player campaign. This robot can talk and pick people; he's like Aladdin, he's the genie, yeah, pretty much, pretty much. Yeah, well, I mean, but uh, cuz I'm not going to play Titanfall multiplayer, I'm just not going to, but the single player looks cool for me.

You had to be later or three weeks earlier but not one week later, that's very interesting. Yeah, I think this is a bad mistake and I don't know like what they're reading in the tea leaves or what they're reading in their marketing and their pre-order numbers - they're reading into doing something like this.

Plus you learn from each other, right? I mean, I was seeing FIFA running in Frostbite was interesting but uh obviously like not necessarily mindblowing uh but seeing Mass Effect which I didn't know it was going to run in Frostbite was interesting as well um so scaling that to all sorts of implementations when you really think of that engine being mostly first-person centric um I thought it was an interesting kind of tidbit, but not like but kind of super insider baseball.

Yeah, they announced the E Originals tenets are unique first-time experiences supporting small devs and funding and offering security for them. So yeah, it is really great idea, great move.

This is still very much E3 and it's clear your hand was forced that it was time to do a press conference and you're not ready for one but you're going to do one and just put out what you can and put out these different videos. And I don't even know if they thought by saying it was EA Play and not a part of E3 that lowers the expectation level when, of course, it doesn't. When there's the live stream same thing to pick on something Colin was saying like I am shocked at how little we saw of Mass Effect. Like right before we did this in the pre-show I was like \"oh that's a shame\" I thought so too I thought you were absolutely right about that yeah I I can't believe it I can't believe we didn't see a gameplay demo I really thought we were going to get a good chunk I thought it was going to be at least 10",

This is what I'm saying again, it all goes back to the same theme, the same theme - a mismanagement of timelines and releasing games and revealing games because you have nothing to talk about except for your annual EA things that everyone's tired of hearing about, of course coming out the F of course coming out the M, another Battlefield, all these kinds of things it's just not that exciting. So like Greg was saying, and it's true, you have to pad your press conference but it's just it's just a mismanagement makes you wonder if EA even needs to have a conference - like why not just disappear? If you were going to do this and do this EA Play thing and let people go hands-on\"",

Then let them focus on that and don't even worry about the press conference because it's just optically bad. Because the weird thing about this is the comparison between how good the games look and how disappointing the conference was. Because it's not like old Konami, stuff that we used to see when they used to actually do like small press conferences where it was like extreme. Like, the games look fantastic - not a single game that I saw, including the sports games, looks anything but great.

So then after Star Wars, they ended with Battlefield 1. Uh, well, actually, still in Star Wars, they also showed the Respawn third-person shooter like at least that stuff when we saw the motion capture footage, that looks really cool, I'm very excited about that. Obvious it's far out, but um, I'm excited, I'm very excited for that. I was like, oh, that's interesting, is they showed a PlayStation VR headset in first-person cockpit of an X-Wing? It looked like I'm not TIE fighter, maybe I think it's TIE fighter, is that right getting fact-checked by Big Nerd, Kevin Keane over there, dork. Uh, so that was you know, that was something.
