HDR gaming, I understand, so the 4K thing right for Blu-ray and for Netflix content and stuff like that. The the games aren't going to be in 4k, so I'm a little confused of what what they mean by sharper. That seems like some because it say sharper and show a bunch of games but really it's just going to be sharper for the the movies and the TV stuff. It doesn't matter, the things that you see will be sharper on the system. They're showing you some some Master Chief helmets and what I'm showing you things here well now this is the HDR section, look how sharper that is, look how look how dark the darks are. Shar none of this matters it's all just marketing speak, Ultra HD, you'll never know the difference but anyway I think the the more important thing is $300 this August and you get the the new controller with the textured grip",

But anyway, I think the more important thing is $300 this August and you get the new controller with the textured grip, that's the big part. No, the Bluetooth actually does help out because then you'll be able to link headsets to it. You assume it doesn't increase range, always always good - never been a problem for me. Yeah, Kevin, have you ever had problems with your range on your Xbox One controllers? Kevin hasn't had any problems with his Xbox. Xbox One S coming at you then, controllers. Sure, after the Gear section they started talking about real quick: when's Xbox One S out - August, na, 2016. We're still in this year. Uh, Gears of War 4 limited edition Elite controller right? So they have this fancy little thing we know that we saw last year, controller - $150. But bam, now there's blood splatters and there's Little Weapon pictures - cool for people who like this stuff. Yeah, I mean it's always fun. Controllers been hard to keep in stock.",

Yep, like as soon as they started in on this, I was like, \"In.\" And especially when I... you know, I thought it was going to be super expensive. I said like $120; I think that's what I thought it was going to cost. When in reality a regular controller is $70, this will be $80 to customize, and if you want to engrave it, it's an extra $10. I'm like, \"Yep, there you go. Totally really understandable pricing.\" Now, what's not understandable is I didn't know that they were $70 controllers standard. Yeah, that's insane. Well, you know what? You want to play with the big boys, you got to buy with the big boys. On which reminds me a lot of back in the day, the N64, when they did their whole little like rainbow of colors. But this is obviously make your own way better, right? I think it's really smart that one of the big boys is actually like, \"You know what? Let's do this.\" For years people have been doing the custom stuff online. I remember I got a custom DS thing, PSP, all this stuff here, bam.",

Interesting to see them come out and like have hardware that needs to step up, it's very fascinating and it's also you know the opposite of how Sony got to do it, Sony had everything leak out right so everyone ran away with opinions on it and then Xbox gets to come out and say this is what we're talking about, this is why we're doing it, we get to inform you of the decision behind Project Scorpio, why it's a good thing, why it's not a bad thing, everything is still compatible and yeah now it'll be interesting to see what happens with what does do they mention it at all they said it wouldn't be there but maybe maybe now they have to do a little something something Maybe not maybe they stay away and come back later I don't know we'll see later tonight follow us",
