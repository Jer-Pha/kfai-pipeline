He's being drawn back into Willamette reluctantly being brought back to investigate something that's been going on in Willamette again. So he goes back to investigate and find out what's happened there - another zombie outbreak has happened. I was going to say did Willamette eventually get put under control? It was under control at some point, it was rebuilding, and the town rebuilt. It didn't end well for Willamette at the end of Dead Rising one, no, yeah, not so good, not a good place. And so they've rebuilt and they've actually built a giant shopping mall to try and bring people in - as you do, Minnesota's been trying to get people in for years with that idea exactly. Yeah, and so they tried to replicate that during the Black Friday weekend, yeah, um zombie",

Okay, that's good to know. So then for you guys, I mean, you're making the fourth game here in Dead Rising; yes, what did you want to bring to the table this time? Well, for us, um, one of the things that we always try and do is see how many zombies we can get on screen; it's always very important for us. So we've we're pretty proud of our efforts so far. What's the what's the number this time? I'm an art director; I don't know numbers, oh God. Yeah, a lot you say a lot; lots, it looks like PR is saying a lot, yeah, PR back there saying it looks pretty; thousands, let's say you, thousands of zombies on the screen, yeah, and it doesn't like Terra flops; don't don't don't no let's not do that again; thousands of zombies.

So Frank's like 52, I think, in this version of the game about that yeah. Then we had all these debates around like what is a 52-year-old like? Should he be slow as hell and yeah like how...and as my boss Joe looks up to Frank because he's kind of his age, and uh sorry I just gave away Joe's age that's okay um and uh we talked a lot about like how he would act, what what his experiences in the past what they would do to him now um so it was a cool exploration and we ended up finding like really good voice talent for him and we found lots of really cool opportunities for like expressing who Frank is. Oh nice yeah it's really good I think in the first uh the first Dead Rising, Frank kind of wore his personality on the outside yeah the jacket the glasses the whole bit you kind of knew",
