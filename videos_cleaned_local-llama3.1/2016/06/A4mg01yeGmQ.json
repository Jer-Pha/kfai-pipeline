I mean I got to give it to Microsoft guys like they really took the shotgun and just \"blasted\" it right at Sony so like great and as Ryan McFarland, our old friend Ryan McFarland at IGN who's covered Xbox for many many years since the very beginning um he basically said like this is the Microsoft that we were missing, this is the Microsoft on offense yep and not trying to catch up not trying to spin their message they're coming out and saying this is who we are, this is what we are, Scorpio sounds like a new console Beyond",

I used my 360 in a way that I was like all right cool I've played this for years, I've gotten enough out of it, I understand what this system is and I thought I was getting that again with Xbox One where it really was a flip where it was like okay cool no PlayStation 4 is performing well everything's amazing great and there's not as many exclusives I need to be playing right now on Xbox one so to get to now where we are with Scorpio it'll be interesting, it's it's and that's what's always been interesting with the 4.5 thing is that with my PlayStation 4 the hundreds of hours I've gotten out of it I'm totally like oh something cool and new souped up PlayStation 4 sure why not whereas a souped up Xbox one I'm like me I'll see how it performs I'll see",

Um, by the way, sorry to jump in here again - not one game they talked about today was an Xbox One exclusive; not one, and this is a huge move to them of what they were talking about at the end of like breaking down barriers and breaking down generations, which I respect. They are all in on Windows PC, yeah, Xbox going be initiative clearly, yeah, and uh, I just thought that that was interesting - I was keeping an eye out for it, like well any of these games just say Xbox exclusive; not one of them said Xbox exclusive.

Minecraft realms is a thing here's some VR stuff. It was that the Realms are out now or whatever and that the friendly update they did say would be coming to Xbox and other consoles down eventually or whatever. So I was interesting from you know, PlayStation still being supported. This section really stood out to me because it was the only part that felt like it was from like a 2008 E3 press conference where it, it just didn't do anything for me and I don't really understand who it's doing anything for and like the people yeah the people presenting it were just like, like overly happy and overly like it just felt so Minecraft.
