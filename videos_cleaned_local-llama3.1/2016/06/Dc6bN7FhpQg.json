So I mean people, you could it looks like Batfleck which looks like uh Dark Knight obviously short ears a little bit there too and stuff. We actually get to see the cowl a bit in the actual screenshots what's exciting more than I think the Art Is Awesome too but this is the official announcement that Troy Baker is Batman Laura Bailey is Selina Kyle, Catwoman who you'll see in this thing Richard Marcille this is a weird one Richard like here's the thing if you didn't know there's a click of voice actors in the world there's Troy there's Laura there's Travis Willingham who of course is in this as well as Harvey Dent these people travel together sometimes they have Ashley Johnson she comes into the fold but now Richard Marcille of course Sully from Uncharted he is in this as well, he is Carmine Falcone so now's one one of the",

It kind of reminds me of the Spider-Man '90s cartoon theme song, oh sure, in the background with all that right. So next up we got this there you go Bruce Wayne. Now this is what's from the get-go been so interesting about the Telltale series: what they talked about is the fact and they talk about it in their press release here in fact, the fact that for as much time as you spend in the bat suit, you're going to spend as Bruce Wayne in this. They really want to get into the psyche of what it's like to be Bruce Wayne/Batman to be that character because we're games are usually really good at making you feel like Batman now granted I'm very much one of\"",

Now, granted, I'm very much one of those guys who thinks Bruce Wayne is the mask, Batman is Batman; Bruce Wayne died with his parents, Batman is the person. But to be able to be Batman in a Telltale game but be Batman while playing Bruce Wayne is going to be really fascinating, right? Not to make the hard-boiled choice every time, but to make I'm the aloof Playboy and this is what happens to me. I mean, I think TT Games is perfect for that thing; it's the only real way you can kind of get that experience without it being lame and boring, like makes it fun and interesting. Yeah, exactly. I mean, Rocksteady gave us a taste \u2013 I remember how much I loved the Arkham City opening, starting as Bruce Wayne getting thrown into Arkham City and then getting to finally go out. But even that was just a taste. Now here we go, little bit more",

Of course, it'll be digital, like everything else. Episodic, you can buy the season pass, and then get the rest of the downloads as you go. But I'm stoked, yeah. It looks great.
