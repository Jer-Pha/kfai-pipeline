It's actually, it actually fits very well and it does a couple of things that I like that I think that everyone who's making shirts for people in the video game industry should do. The shirt should be slightly wider than it's supposed to be, uh, and the arms should be slightly higher than they're supposed to be because that makes your biceps look bigger - that's just the way it goes. I'm such a big fan of this shirt that no lie last night I ordered two more from the website because I want it. The problem is they don't wash well, no, they don't. Is it losing its luster? It's losing the luster but I like it so much. I mean, it's a... it was one of those things that I remember during E3 week, I think on the way down there you were wearing it and then it popped up two days later in the rotation. I was like, \"That can't be washed.\" But you just look so good. Oh, no, no, no, no. You don't wash things after one wear that's that's how you lose their luster when you sweat.",

So that's the problem I'm in Daly City, there's no chance of that thing drying; it's just going to mildew and rot and disappear before anything happens. Well, then you're going to be Kevin, and just wear the mildew-stained shirt, act like over here, the pride of Long Island, Colin. It was only a month, Kevin, it was only a month of that they left in the dryer, and everything smelled like mildew. What was supposed to do? Supposed to do.

And why do we make excuses and then pretend like these excuses, these these these problems which are valid \u2013 like a due process Fifth Amendment problem \u2013 can't be solved with other legislation. In other words, like we've gotten to this really bizarre point where everyone is just... it's getting worse than everywhere. Like a mass shooting can't even bring us all together and like make us solve problems. And I think there's a disingenuousness on both sides for sure. I think like when you hear the stats of like there are so many \u2013 30,000 to 40,000 gun deaths a year \u2013 I'm like... \"There are in the\"",

No, I mean the insinuation in these statistics is anyone who knows that looks at these statistics is that the numbers are padded, obviously padded. But this is neither here nor there. The situation is that even if we are able to solve just one instance of of a mass shooting, shouldn't we try to at least ameliorate like the issues, the legislative or practical or logistical issues of making sure that like when you go to a gun show, maybe you should have to go through the same rigors of getting a gun at a gun shop, or um if you're on a terrorist watch list and the T-I-U-S watch list is constitutional which it's not right now, that you might have a problem.",
