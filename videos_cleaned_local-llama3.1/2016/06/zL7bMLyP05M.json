It wasn't like he talked about stuff and would look at us about it, and the fact that like we you ever been he was looking at me, it was very clear that we have said on multiple occasions we've been saying Kratos is a terrible character; he is one-dimensional. These are the problems with him, and he had talked about the fact that this is Kratos - like the way he described the game is interesting; it's a reimagining of God of War but of the gameplay, but a continuation of the story. This is the Kratos we've known forever, however lots of time has passed between his Greek god era and now his Norse era, and this is him. Well, this is the first God of War from a story perspective I'm actually super excited about the way he talked about it, yea dimensionally, I think that like you know to your",

I think that like you know to your point there was some confusion I know you were confused when we were talking about we're talking about the game where after we saw it at the press conference, yeah it is a continuation because I had noted he has like the Omega symbol and it's called Spartan rage, that guy himself. So I'm like are they really gonna like call it all that and then reboot it? So so the instincts that some people had I think before they've confirmed it was right that this is a continuation and there's a reason an arc in the story about how he gets to Scandinavia which we'll explore in the game but I feel like you know Cory talked about it as like the one through three and I guess you can count like you know the Ready at Dawn games as well as being kind of the first act of Kratos, Kratos is angry and knows",

I mean, I enjoy playing the God of War games, but this seems to be a third-person action game in the vein of some of the great third-person action games that we've been getting the last five years or so. And God of War taking a long break from the canon - Ascension, I guess isn't there somewhere to but taking a long break and kind of figuring out what this game could be is really interesting to me. And I felt validated in a sense when he was like \"it's like the game is like Tomb Raider\" right? I was like that's exactly what I said - the game question was, what is the open-world? Is right? He talked about the game being broad and what he came back with is it's a little bit bigger than what the Tomb Raider open areas were. You have freedom to explore and do whatever but you're in that area, you're still locked down to that area while you do it.",

But are you so you're not the only one that felt like Kratos was just looking at you know what I'm saying? Certain **** like you know just heard us talk **** about Kratos, but right, and I think that was the thing he talked about how we were getting a longer demo session had the longer intro, right. Some of that might be just because we are so vocal about it, but again it worked in the fact of coming out and being like in a way it was a speaking to the point that I was making in the trailer, right or the demo reaction, I guess. The Spartan Race filling up and then Kratos trying to call him down and talk to his son and then reaching out and think it's this Kratos trying to find humanity is interesting he's lost from it right he's angry",

And so I think that what you see in this new God of War is there's deeper mechanics and systems, role-playing like systems, and there was always upgrading in the God of Wars games, but this seems to be like you're earning experience points, you're finding new locations, you're collecting things, there are a little side quests and all sorts of things in the game that I think are gonna make a more cohesive experience, make it a more well-rounded game, make it feel more than what the other God of Wars did feel like, which were fun action games. But now again, yeah this is being pulled into that third-person realm Sony's known for. And what I found fascinating that I didn't think of based on the demo is that your son is with you the whole time. It sounds like, yeah I'm sure, yeah exactly.

Obviously they'll roll out things as it makes sense for them. But I was really as good as the game looks, I was really excited to hear Cory Barlog talk about it because I thought he talked about it really eloquently. One of the most thoughtful people that I've ever met in the industry, and I think that he seems to be able to take a step back from something that's hard to take a step back from when we do our podcast and we get criticism about the things that you love and that you built wherever. But sometimes you have to step back and hear criticism to make things better. And it seems like that was the entire initiative with this game, sure. What's this stuff that can be like?
