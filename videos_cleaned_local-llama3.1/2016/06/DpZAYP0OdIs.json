But really, the heart of the game is about 1970s science fiction, and um, you know we really took a lot of inspiration from movies like Barbarella and Logan's Run and Silent Running, and those sort of movies. And you know, so the game is really about the last living human organic being in the galaxy, but you're just ahead... oh great, yeah, you're just ahead. But you wake up in this world that's all automation, so all of humanity has left their organic bodies and instead inhabit robotic impostors, and the whole world is governed by an evil computer intelligence, just like everything in the 1970s - computers are evil, like in the '70s, new computers and robots are evil. I think we kind of forgot that we've given them too much power for sure. And um, so we're going to play through a segment that's not the start of the game but a little ways into the game, and um, in this segment you've got back past\"",

How many times did you guys watch Logan's Run before you made this game? Uh quite a few. I have, I have quite an extensive library of 70 science fiction films that we all watch - like we watch one a week. This is a fun Larium film and uh if you uh you can dance too throughout the game, a lot of unique dancing in the game. He put it down, yeah. So the uh the interesting thing is because you're con L switching bodies, each body, each body can do things a little differently - slightly differently in this case, just have different dances. We talk to other individuals, they'll respond to you differently based on the body you have, so you can kind of like weave a little bit more into what's going on in the backstory.

Well, I've been to many so this is where you like this is supposed to be a pleasure thing right but these citizens are just zoned out, they're just like just sitting there staring at these psychedelic patterns or in the Fondarium; they're in robot bodies that actually can't feel but they're rubbing themselves on the shag carpet and so what you learn nice little little friction um science, science friction science friction. I like it. So much for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.

So that ties a bit into the Metroid in terms of like that door progression and then we also have um uh you show them the upgrade system do your job I was waiting for you so um you know you will find things like there's a continuous laser beam and if you fly your head and it destroys you so you're seeing this sort of soft gating stuff here that you can't get by um your helmet will get abilities that allow you to kind of get",

So in the beginning of the game, you got the ability to vacuum off heads, which you've shown me. But we're going to get another one here soon. So yeah, some of these are um there's a lot of head sucking in the game, good. Um, yep, and uh, uh, you uh like it's too easy. Yeah, that's the game is kind of built for it. So here's kind of like the upgrade tree, and you see that we have this one of the branches has been unlocked, which is the which is this sort of pink branch here, which we got a vacuum drive, and there are these other upgrades that you can start to access as you buy their things in the branch.

I like how every room the camera is like slightly different; sometimes it will be like just a 2D thing, it's more 2.5 coming at you, whatever. It's like Metro, very Shadow Complex in a lot of ways too. But I like also that the head mode is fast - you know, usually you don't get to like speed around until later in a being a style game. But I like that the two different modes are very different gameplay; you know, one's a bit more bullet-hell-y, yeah, and it gets that way in the later game especially because you can imagine when you're finding enemies that have say purple lasers - they're bouncing six times off the environment every time they fire, and they're using quad laser or eight fractal laser patterns.",

It feels very so there should be something and the lock read more comics, comics are good. Uh, so uh the other interesting thing is that um just in terms of bodies and heads is that uh if you know the head is a little more vulnerable than the body because you can see here he's getting shot and the head will recharge its health over time but bodies don't.

You can uh there are a couple ways to do it: there are occasional healing stations you can find uh in the environment, but there's also upgrades that let you use your helmet energy to regenerate the bodies as they take damage. This yes good, so he's uh got little dogs you can suck the head off a dog and be a dog. I've been waiting to suck off a dog a long time; this is the game for you, got it? So what can the dog do? Is that just more of a cute thing or does it have skills?
