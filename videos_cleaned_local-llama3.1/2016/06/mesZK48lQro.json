So, what were you able to crunch in there? I mean, there's two hardware announcements, technically. Um, just to get the big one out of the way, Scorpio - can you tell us anything about this? I mean, we know it's coming late 2017; it's going to be the new iteration of Xbox One or Xbox. Uh, is this exciting internally? Are you guys stoked? Incredibly exciting! I mean, I've been on Xbox since we launched the original console, and it feels in many ways we're getting back to like the core of what Xbox and the brand started with - being about power, being about building incredible games that we love, investing in Xbox Live. And for me, you know, to be able to unveil a new console is a very special thing; you only sort of get to do that",

You know, how are you guys sort of thinking about how do we convince people it's worth it to go 4K to get that extra HDR processing and stuff like that? Sure. Well, first we still have a lot of people today who own an Xbox 360 - tens of millions that have not upgraded to Xbox One yet. So if they were waiting for that moment in time, there's never been a better time to do that. You get a console that is 40% smaller; the power brick is integrated. You want to lay it horizontal? You want to stack it up vertically? You can do that as well. And then we say, listen: we know whether you have a 4K TV or not - it's 4K ready for you. So when you do upgrade to that 4K TV, it's there; it will upscale your content to 4K, whether it's native or not. And then all the 4K video, 4K Blu-ray... and if you have a 4K TV with HDR, yeah.",

Are you rocking the 4K in your household currently? I'm not 4K yet, not yet, so I'm 4K at work, so I'm sort of like I get the experience as a worker you know but uh I'm I'm thinking about doing it this holiday. Can you break down the HDR thing for me, like what does that mean? I know what that means in photography, but what exactly does that mean when it comes to TVs and consoles?

Uh, and then you know, I'll tell you personally as a gamer, the thing I love the most about this is that you want to be really gentle with this thing, it's that you could actually put this in your laptop top or messenger bag. So you'll see it's the team is calling it \"robot white\", so it's a unique white uh, you can see all the ports on the back I'm showing it to you and I got to realize will probably be a little more courteous to the viewers at home, you get a sense of all the different ports we have here on the back.

Gamers are responding a lot to these Great Value games - they're really unique style games and genres.
