Subscribe now at youtube.com/kindafunnygames to not miss a thing. Oh hi there everybody, it's me Greg Miller, and this is a let's play on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames of Gravity Rush 2. I'm going to turn around now and play it; you can still hear me though. You see this? We got this cat Sid - you remember them from the first game, Cat of course, our superhero. We play as Syd, that cop who ended up coming out with us. He always had like he had the hots for us; we knew it, but we didn't engage. I don't think they've engaged here or anything. Uh, we're moving in Gravity Rush 2 to a new spot here - Jirard's easier to read the word sometimes than it is. It's the same um, we're going to get to play through fight a bunch of stuff, but I was just talking to our good friend Nick - you remember Nick? He was on Beyond once or twice about some of the differences in the game, and for him, a big one was",

This is how it was back then in prehistoric times. We start this mission, Forbidden Cargo, of course. The graphic cutscenes are here. You get to do this, rotate your camera, look around the comic page, get to see Cat be all cute. Come on now, how cute she is. She jumps over here; she's not impressed with this guy. He's got cargo there; he goes do this. We've got to help him get his cargo back. These guys want to do this; all this is happening. Got all this happening.
