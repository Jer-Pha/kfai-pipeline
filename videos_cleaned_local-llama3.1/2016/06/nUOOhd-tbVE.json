Dishonored II offers you the choice of playing as Empress Emily Kaldwin or the Royal Protector Corvo Attano. Emily and Corvo are both fully voiced this time with their own perspectives and emotional responses to the events transpiring around them. Whether you choose to play whoever you choose to play, you've got to flee your home and travel to Karnaca in order to unravel the threads of a conspiracy and take back what's yours. I've got to get away; I should talk to the captain of that ship. I wonder if he chose the girl or the guy. Dishonored is known for unscripted, simulation-driven missions where no two players ever have the same experience. There are many pathways to explore as you penetrate well-defended locations, and numerous ways to find and eliminate nefarious targets. In crafting the missions for Dishonored 2, we've put a much greater emphasis on big, interesting themes - either from a gameplay or fictional standpoint.",
