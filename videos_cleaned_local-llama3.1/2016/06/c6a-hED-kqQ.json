Subscribe now at youtube.com/kindafunnygames to not miss a thing. Greetings and salutations, welcome back to Kinda Funny Games! My name is Colin Moriarty, I'm here with Chris Kohler. Chris number one from Hairbrained Schemes is offscreen playing the game, and we're here playing Necropolis. Necropolis - yeah, it's an action role-playing game. Looks like... oh, yeah, it's a 3D action RPG-likee uh so you're going to get like uh the Dark Souls-inspired combat, and you're also going to get a roguelike which in this case means procedural, so it's going to be different every time uh and you get one life, so it's going to be permadeath yes, so it's going to be difficult. I like that yeah now tell me about the origins of this game where did you guys come up with this idea uh so uh me and Dennis basically the creative director uh we're kind of knocking heads together trying to",

Okay cool, oh okay you guys are doing that, um, all right, so tell me what's going on on the game right here, like what are we what are we looking at, what are we trying to do? You're like Nameless Adventurer #5,663, you know whatever, and uh, basically you came here to the Necropolis, uh, which is like a mega structure, uh, of you know honoring the the Wizard of Braxis who's like the most powerful wizard of all time, and so he built it to sort of house his conquests and his treasures and things like that, and you came here to get loot as adventurers do, as one would yes, uh, so you find yourself trapped and you're trying to figure out well what happened to Braxis nobody's seen him for a very long time, uh, but also like",

So I've noticed a lot of collecting as one does in a game like this of different materials seems like there's a crafting system of some sort. There is a crafting system. So you'll notice the stamina bar is like straight out of Dark Souls at stamina sort of mechanic but he's used Power Attack so he's gotten some amount of exhaustion and so he can take a munch on that ham hack and it'll actually restore some of that. So you're constantly trying to balance that stuff and so you're going to want to craft new food items, you're going to craft potions and bombs and all sorts of good stuff. Yeah I enjoy you know the Castlevania like eating of the meat during the games the giant meat um alright so you're talking about how the game's procedural which is awesome cuz it is Rog-like y um what are the goals also obviously they're procedural or is it just randomly generating tasks for",

Um, what are the goals, also obviously they're procedural or is it just randomly generating tasks for you to do? Is there some sort of campaign or is it going to be really more like Rogue Legacy or something where it's like kind of just trying to get through the same thing over and over again? So yeah, you're trying to basically well as a player develop your skills but uh the the goals that the Brazen Head gives you are pretty much random and uh so he's just going to try and say you know help me clear out the Undead on level three that kind of stuff. Um, and if you do those you'll get tokens of favor so tokens of favor are the only thing that persist or things you buy with tokens of favor uh between playthroughs so what you're going to spend those on are basically codexes which you can unlock new abilities like super jump or Vampire's Kiss things like that um you can also use them to open\"\n\nI corrected the following errors:\n\n* \"Rog like\" \u2192 \"roguelike\"\n* \"are the goals also obviously them procedural\" \u2192 \"are the goals, also obviously they're procedural\"\n* \"Brazen Head give you are pretty much random\" \u2192 \"Brazen Head gives you are pretty much random\"\n* \"Vamp prism\" \u2192 \"Vampire's Kiss\" (correcting a likely phonetic error)\n* Capitalized proper nouns like \"Rogue Legacy\", \"Brazen Head\", and \"Undead\".",

You can also use them to open the super sweet gold chest that's down by the elevator to sort of give you a leg up on this play through. But generally, everything you get or collect is going to reset if you die. Okay, that's I was going to ask, so like, so it's more like Enter the Gungeon than Rogue Legacy where you are starting from scratch pretty much every time. Starting from scratch does nothing; carry over is there is it those codexes and those tokens of favor - the only things carry over. Yeah, got it. So there is one saving grace to that. We do support four-player co-op, so if you bring some friends, if you get down, you have a chance for your friend to resurrect you before like everyone is dead. So in the multiplayer scenario, it's a total party wipe will keep you from going game over; is it?",
