He said that what Shawn so we're not talking just like remastered Uprising no, from the ground up - the three Crash games that matter. What do you think \"ground up\" means? I don't know. I mean if it means they're going to treat it like they did in Uncharted and kind of get the game updated just a bit, you know, the physics and stuff so it's not as stiff using the d-pad and where just walking over edges and like totally sold on that. Graphics do whatever you want. He looks a little stupid in the Skylanders he looks good in the Skylanders one thing people are really hating on him for looking really stupid. I don't think he looks that stupid, he looks Skylanders - he's in the world of Skylanders but that's classic Crash. Do you see a Travis tattoo? I don't. They did it Greg, they did it. They did it for me. I believed in him, I believed in him. Yeah and he",

I believed in him, I believed in him, yeah, and he tweeted, and then he tweeted a little heart at me 'cuz he knows, yeah, he knew, he knew how much this meant to you. This means a lot to me, I can't believe it happened, I seriously cannot believe this. I love how every time it's the music that sets you off, and like I just don't know the music, and they had that crowd shot, the music, like what? And then he turned around, and Shawn Layden was walking out; he had the Shadow of the Colossus cast behind him of Crash, and and you thought first you got really excited, and then you thought it was just going to be this, and then he came back and said we talked to Activision. Oh my God, I mean this is so exciting to me, I was literally shaking; we're gonna break out, going to break out the reaction. Oh my God, I was so so so excited that I couldn't even like pay attention to it, I'm a little",
