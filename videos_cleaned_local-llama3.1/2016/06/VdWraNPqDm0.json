On these, you know, yeah, I think they talk about mods, I think they talk about sales; I they talk about the sustained support of It new patches. I I know that they want to do more content for Fallout 4. I don't I don't know that it behooves them to do that. It just doesn't seem like Fallout 4 has the same buzz that Fallout 3 had, so I mean it has a substantial but it's a massive game, but you know contextually speaking, I I don't know that it's worth it for them to do that. In Fallout 3 had five pieces of DLC, including one only one Far Harbor type piece of DLC, which was Point Lookout. So um I think it's obviously going to be there uh but I don't know that it's going to be a lynchpin; I don't know that anything from Bethesda Game Studios is going to be a lynchpin at this particular conference, that was last year Skyrim; do you think we'll see an HD Collection version whatever for",

No, I... I don't know. I feel like I don't know it might be too hard to judge because I mean this is what I was saying a PS love xoxo it might be a little too harsh, but it's just to say like I think people are kind of over this stuff now in a way where it's just like let's see what you have, go away and you know make something. Like we just got The Witcher 3, we just got Dying Light, just got Far Cry 4 and Far Cry Primal with these open-world games that look better, that run better, that play better, that are more fun.

But then again, they did that with The Evil Within 2. So um, MachineGames has been quiet, and I think that uh, it's it's time. And I'm so excited like that's definitely what I'm most excited about because they are so good, so very good. Yeah, Doom DLC yeah probably. Yeah, Doom's people love Doom which I'm happy about. It did a really nice job. The new ID is Evil Within 2 yes. Um, you think it's a teaser trailer or a demo what are we getting? I I think so, I don't know that you do.

Um, which, and I think that MachineGames might be further along - that's my assumption. I don't know for sure because The Evil Within seems so tortured that it seems like that studio needs a little bit more time. I don't know if you're going to get both of those but I think it's going to be one or the other. If it's both, then Bethesda is firing on all cylinders and that's going to be awesome um but The Evil Within 2 is probably a 2017 game and they're definitely going to do another one.

Oh okay then no maybe it's not this year at all but I don't think you release that game they have to be smart about um prioritizing when they release these games and managing their portfolios like you don't want to go up against Activision games no you know, EA games like you just need you need to you need to go at a pace they wait too long they're going to go up against Destiny 2 though Wikipedia says 2017 so it's one of those games nobody knows division expansions I'm sure definitely a bit about that definitely for Honor yeah I mean it'll be there for sure they're going to do more with it they made a big deal about it last year and everybody did walk away going that seemed kind of cool and we",
