That don't she came real quick though on camera okay okay go go go do your job we'll do ours all right these fans they just come out of the woodwork these PS I love you XOXO fans so one of the cool things that appears so you're playing as Connor the Android first of all they confirm that there's going to be more than two playable characters so we we know we're going to play Conor con but we don't know anything El",

They confirm that there's going to be more than two playable characters, so we know we're going to play as Conor, but we don't know anything about Conor's an android. He's called in, as we saw in the trailer, to deal with a hostage situation. Um, what you learn is that quickly is that Connor has this power of perception using his mechanical mind, I guess, or his AI or software, um, to figure out his exact like exactly his chance of success of his mission and you can... and so this thing is ticking down from like 47% to 46% based on how quickly you're going through it or because time is of the essence here. But you stop and analyze different things and your success goes up or down depending on like the things you do. So he finds like a guard that Daniel, the android, had shot and killed and he figures out how that all happened and his percentage goes up a little bit. And then he finds the little girl's dad that the Android killed and finds",

Then he finds the little girl's dad, who the Android killed, and finds the tablet that the dad was looking at. It looks like they're looking to replace Daniel, so that's why Daniel goes crazy. So the chance of success goes way up. But as time goes on, success drops down, down, down, down, down. So when he walks out, he sees an injured police officer that Daniel also shot, and he gets a tourniquet on him, but that time taken and the trust loss between him and Daniel brings the P percentage back down. So the first time they played, we go through all these choices, and ultimately Connor saves the little girl, but gets shot and killed, and Daniel's killed as well. Okay, so you succeed because the success is uh keeping the girl alive, which is keeping her alive. But you lose Conor for the rest of the game. Gotta um... oh, so it's just like Heavy Rain, where if somebody dies, the game keeps moving.",
