Well, speaking of bigger story, uh, you guys had a, you know, sort of the trailer, the presentation during the press conference yesterday, uh, you really went at showing a visual representation of all the branching dialogue stuff, all the branching opportunities, branching ways that Quantic Dream has done so well in their previous games. Talk about that scope and sort of how you're evolving that system in terms of your gameplay design approach.

This is really what we try to create. It's very complex to write, to be honest with you, because it very quickly becomes a mess. Yeah, I can imagine. Because there are tons of things, and you want to be absolutely consistent on the consequences that you give. You want them to surprise the player but at the same time to be logical. And you want many of them. So we just show one scene, and this very first scene has like six more than six outcomes that will have an impact later in the game.

The Heavy Rain Platinum, we both got the Heavy Rain platinum, we had to go through a lot of documents, it was like it was like A Beautiful Mind over there, like in our living room with all these things. Um, one of the things I'm always fascinated by is you guys - you really have a big name, David Cage is a big name, Quantic Dream is a big name that you guys make good games.

It also makes everything more complex in many ways because then production becomes incredibly difficult and then you need to scan actors and you need to have performance capture and you want the right rendering and lighting needs to be perfect so it makes attention to detail much more important and uh but at the same time I don't think that technology is absolutely required to create emotion, it's just another tool, more colors on your palette but that's it. Do you miss when it was simpler when it wasn't so hard and there were shaders and lighting and scanning and there's a million things because I have to imagine like you're talking I asked you at the beginning you've been working on it too long like you know this game becomes very complex because yes we have very high ambition for it and we try to create something.",

The technology becomes more and more demanding, and I would say that the bad side of that is that the company is now 200 people. So when you work on something that tries to be different, you have a vision for it; you need to um evangelize this vision across 200 people in your studio, which is more effort for a game creator than if we were like 10 working on the same thing. And you know, you know what it's, it's a very different experience. So I think there are some very good sides to it because then you have the power and you can do incredible things, and you really enjoy doing it at the same time.
