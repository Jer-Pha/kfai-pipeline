Cuz like obviously looking at the the press conference last night there's a whole bunch of amazing-looking games, Crash Bandicoot. What I give it moment of the show undeniably for me is Crash Bandicoot. I'm not going to give it one of these absolutely not right; The Resident Evil 7 I think that's super super awesome. I'm not going to give it not going to give it one, you know Spider-Man undeniably. I'm sure that if I could play or see more actual gameplay of it, it would get one of these but because we're not nah Detroit though that's a game that I wouldn't necessarily be into and they sold me on it and I think that's why they deserve one of these okay I'm glad you're giving the Detroit: Horizon of this year for me where last year I would have thought that",

Day Gone getting one day gone, see that's one of the ones where Get One I liked what I saw of Horizon Zero Dawn but Days Gone seems to be really what I'll be after a narrative-driven game. I'm running through Nick, what are you doing? Kevin, we need a camera kit in about 10 minutes. God damn it, Kevin, why is he always ruining the shows? This is totally your fault, and you know it. Get up here and apologize; get up here and take your damage. Look, look at the wide camera and apologize. No, get up in there and you apologize. I'm sorry they can't hear me though; just say you're sorry. I just, I didn't mean it. Um, so Days Gone definitely getting one. I think the game looks awesome.

Are you but so are we doing what we did last year, which was our uninformed flail into the ground pretty much of just picking a game of the show with Sony or are we not picking a game of the show? If that's the case, then I vote for Persona 5. Persona 5 is not even like playable though, but it's there, so let's just throw a couple on there. What do you think? I say we wait and put it up there. You want to wait? I say we need to see Persona, I need to see Zelda, I need to see Last Guardian. Colin needs to see... I'm sure everything is true.
