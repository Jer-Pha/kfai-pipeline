And beyond that, when Gears 4 is released on both platforms this October, every co-op mode in the game will support crossplay. So players on Xbox One and Windows 10 can play together through the co-op campaign, co-op multiplayer, and yes, even The All-New Horde Mode.

Awesome, we've turned Gwent into a full-blown multiplayer experience, and thanks to its crossplay feature, you can battle people from around the world regardless of whether they use PC or consoles. And on top of that, we're also creating a monumental single-player campaign. Now, we've kept the core mechanics that made Gwent fun but we've improved on them, we've added new ones, and we've also redesigned the visuals almost completely. However, the most important thing is though that Gwent is still a card game that's based on skill, so it puts you not just your cards in the center of things.
