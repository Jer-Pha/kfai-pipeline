So you can throw your sword, pull out the magnet thing, attach it to the sword, and then use your sword as a far away sword - oh, far away sword! Yeah, better reach on your sword. Sure... awesome! Yeah, that's super cool. You can do stuff like that because that seems like the type of thing that would be out of limitations, you know? Yeah, 100% so that's super exciting and I like just the kind of system where there's the stamina - it's like you can climb anything, you can go anywhere, you can run whatever you want but or swim whatever. But it's all based on the time of that and obviously as the game goes on, I'm sure you get more... you like level it up.

Yeah, Anno was talking about how he that that one image, the original image from the instruction manual from the first Zelda, like that was the total inspiration for this game, and you can totally see it visually and just in terms of the scope and the gameplay elements and all that stuff. Um, and they did an interview recently with Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9 and he was saying that you can beat the game without even having much of the story elements at all, and I think that's cool. I like that it's just like do whatever the hell you want, tell your own story. Um, I also think they're taking a lot of the classic Zelda elements, like bombs and stuff. I don't know if you guys got to this bit, but instead of just being the normal bombs that we know, there's two different types of bombs: one rolls with the whole physics-based stuff, and the other one is more of a square block that you just kind of",

And it's just like little tiny tweaks like that I think really kind of flesh out the world and explain to you the type of direction that they want you to go but then let you go whatever direction you want. I think that's the most important thing. Um, I liked being able to push the rocks and have it roll down the hill and like crush people, and they teach you how to do that so that later on I'm sure in the game there'll be much more advanced things where you get to play with the physics and all that stuff. Um, and in the same way that old Zelda's taught you if there's a crack in a wall bomb it, there's a secret in there anytime there's water and stuff when you have the magnet like already I know search the water there's",
