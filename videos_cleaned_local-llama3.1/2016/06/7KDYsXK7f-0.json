Good for you, not normal for Greg Miller, that's great. But I'm recuperating. Yeah, I've been uh, you know, today Lola and I had to go to Petco, yeah, get our nails trimmed, need to get her some food, got her some toys. Okay, so you know there's things to do. I understand that's definitely right. There is enough to keep you not rested, not relaxed. I had thought about that for a long time as I did it. Get psyched up for it. Did you play anything since E3?

Uh, it's a little more simplistic, I would say in a way than the grid-based games like Final Fantasy Tactics. But basically you're just going around a map with up to four characters in your party. Um, and then you run into enemies and then there you fight them on a grid but the Grid's like three lines and then you can like go in between the lines and fight them and there's different character classes. Play it for a few hours, it's pretty good. I'm going to restart it cuz I did make like a a significant error in the game that I need to um to fix basically seems like after no I wouldn't make that after uh that uh tutorial open so there's an opening",

This doesn't look like a tri-A game and it doesn't look like an indie game, it looks like that THQ space where games got **** out here's the the good news about Mighty though is that I was so done with and and the I don't give a **** about this game anymore space and I authentically was because of the delays and all the",

I was told by a friend of mine who reviewed the game for another outlet that it's easily there's a specific weapon in the game that totally breaks that system which I didn't even realize so there's already broken mechanics in the game the game's even out and people already figured out how to break it, and I just don't understand that. Even if that mechanic is sound, and it is, it's fine. What about this as Mega Man? Like what about this: you can go in any order, and then use their their weapons, and like the boss weapons aren't even all that useful, and the game tells you basically what weapons you're supposed to use so the whole mystery of like how basically if you select the stage and you have the weapon you need it'll have like extra intel and you like go and like the the Mighty.",

Oh yeah, I gotta go back and beat it, but because maybe it gets better, I don't know, but I'm just telling you my impressions of like the meat of the game, and every Mega Man game, the meat of the game is not the castles, but getting through those stages that's what's so fun about those games. Yeah, just expect drab characters, seeing the same enemies over and over again, these terrible 2.5D graphics, no design aesthetic at all, no design philosophy at all, just okay cool good good use of an amateur team, like not that Yacht Club are amateurs but like they made other games, but those guys made a game that is exponentially better than Mighty Number Nine, so if you want to play a game that's like out an old school aesthetic and an old school style and a fix you go play",

Number one, it's time to go hands-on with PlayStation VR. Sony has revealed its Nationwide Blitz of retailers showcasing PSVR at select Best Buy and GameStop locations with more than 300 stores participating across the US and Canada as of June 24th, so in a few days. Go to experience.playstation.com to find out if there are any stores in your area that are taking part, so you can basically go to these stores in various towns and cities around the United States and play PSVR. PlayStation VR World, Valkyrie, Headmaster, Battle Zone, and Super Hypercube are the demos that will be shown off to start. So if you are interested in PSVR and you should be as long as your body can take it because not everyone's.",

Your thoughts, it's all in the same thing here. Well let me say this before we even get into it because there is a number three is pertinent to this get it in there number three Eurogamer also reports that PlayStation 4 Neo will indeed launch this year regardless of not being 83 and regardless of it being rumored to be significantly underpowered compared to Microsoft's Xbox One revision due out in late 2017, quote, \"several sources have indicated to me that PlayStation Neo launches this year despite its E3 no-show\"",

So that's in there as well. I feel Sony's committed to it. I think I've heard the Eurogamer story before. I've heard Andrew House talk about it; it's real now it's out there. They need to deal with it, and I think you see House here getting on board with what their messaging is going to be that it's not meant to compete with the Scorpio; it's just meant to be a high-end PlayStation 4 for 4K resolutions. Is that a smart move? I don't know, no, no. And this is and this is why see people a lot of people were mad at me; it was so shockingly like I don't know why they think I'm a Microsoft fanboy.

So everyone's like, \"it's the same thing.\" I'm like, no, it's not the same thing. They're giving you more space and time between the release; they're announcing it earlier. And it is a quantum leap compared to the Xbox One when compared to the Neo versus the Neo rumored specs versus the PlayStation 4 - that's totally different. And the way Microsoft is doing it, I think is smarter now. It is an admission as we talked about Patrick Leyden is the one who came up with this, that it is them saying we lost.

If you don't remember, ladies and gentlemen, in the last regular non-E3 edition of PS I Love You XOXO, our annual tradition continued of making predictions for what would happen at the PlayStation press conference. And our good friend Mitchell Morgan was there to document it all. So, Mitchell Morgan writes in to go through the results with this: \"Hey guys, it's that time of year again - the time of year when Colin loses whatever shred of trust he still has in me again. But I persist and I present you with the results of your E3 2016 predictions.

Mitchell continues now to the important stuff as a reminder Colin was the winner of the last E3 prediction show, of course I was. Now shall we get into it? We should, we shall. Tim is up first, his prediction was that Final Fantasy XV will be a PS4 bundle and will be bundled with a Final Fantasy VII demo. Mitchell Morgan's results: A Final Fantasy XV bundle was not shown and we didn't hear a word about Final Fantasy VII or a demo.

What's the point when you come out and tell us what was in it anyway? Thanks Stephen from Scotland. The answer is easy: it's a fact that press conferences have only so much time. You can't come out there and talk at length for 30 minutes about every game that comes out, but behind closed doors, you can. You can go in there, have journalists get a chance to ask questions, have them report back on the information they see. If you know, especially what works really well for us and for you as fans is the fact that with so many different sessions going on, so many different people getting in there, they get a chance to get more information out of them.

So you imagine the team though - some of the team is there, but I'm saying the dynamic at the top.

The last had their own interesting take on it. Um, and I actually think this takes even more interesting, and the reason is it's a way for them to market it in an effective way as more than a showcase of tech, a technical showcase, which the game is like; as people pointed out, like the fact that that game runs the way it does with that many characters on screen is actually really remarkable, and that's why they went I think with Unreal Engine 4, which is unusual for a first-party game.",
