What are what are your your biggest moments of E3? What's your favorite thing so far? The number one thing that I've seen that I've been most excited about is We Happy Few came out of nowhere - looks so good, such a great trailer. I'm excited; I love the 1984 Brave New World sort of Bioshock Black Love feel. I love it. I'm very excited. I really like that Microsoft's kind of giving a lot of focus to games like that at their conferences because old Microsoft totally would not have done that.",
