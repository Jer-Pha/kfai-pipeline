So I mean, pass that about 16 years ago. Before we get into the fun, the fun part of this, let's talk about the repercussions, 'cause I feel like that is important to address. You need to read my rule, my rule of thumb in general is never take a picture that you wouldn't be okay with getting out there because it could and it probably will. You have to accept that if you take a photo. My my rule of thumb is similar: do I look my best? Like, if my bare ass has to be shown to the world, and I'm going to be proud of this bare ass, and the answer is usually yes, and then I send a photo that's good. So that's really good because there's this culture now where you know everyone having a phone in their pockets, and images are just being tested left and right willy-nilly; something's going to get out. Just be okay with it, and just know that, and um",

And just think about that - further down that road, think about what that could affect, think about the relationships that could affect, think about the career choices that it might limit. You just need to know those things. Having said that, let's talk about the fun stuff: how to make them better. Oh man, angles, yeah. See I'm the opposite of this - I would never do this simply because I hate my body and if I ever saw myself naked in the shower, I'd put a blindfold on and feel around like a blind man in a pool. Um, yeah, I don't know how people would do this. This is a generational thing, to be fair - but also men have it a lot harder than women, I think. The key",

Like, well, the male body is... it's that type where it goes \"all right.\" So, women have a little more options in terms of looking good. I mean, this is coming from a guy who isn't like super vain if I was vain then it's the whole yeah I told story but I don't know when to be vain exactly. So what you want to do is make them laugh, you want to tantalize, you want to send a picture that's like \"hey, here's where I'm at right now, am I naked? Yeah, I am. Am I doing this cheeky?\" It's not like full comedy, you're not going full barel, but don't dress it up, you know what I mean. You don't want to be putting like...",

You don't want to be putting little outfits on the guy. Do women in general respond positively to that? The dickpic is not like an \"I want to see your dick\" \u2013 it's so hot; it's more of an \"insurance\" that this is a two-way street: I give you a business card, two hands up, and you give me back the M, two hands exactly. For women, a lot of times I see like underwear models in D-poses. There's like an Ariana Grande leak where she had this great photo where she was in her underwear, but she took it from up here, and she's like really weird. I try to recreate those because it's like pop stars really know their angles; they're a big part of what I'm a fan of in general. Do you want to check out some photos, get some?",

Do you want to check out some photos get some good angles uh take a lot of photos delete the ones you don't like exactly. I think that's one of the major keys and angles is totally key. I think mirrors people need to realize mirr are mirrors. Get the butt, get a little bit of everything that's the thing if you get that angle where it's like you can get from the camera you get your you know the the goodies up here and then in the mirror you get the the goodies back there. That is a pro maneuver plus yeah I've tried before I've tried to send like nudes to my wife or just pictures of my anatomy and there's always like I try I'm like how do I get the lowest angle do I put it on the ground so this thing looks like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. I don't know it doesn't work it always ends up looking like a kid running through the woods.",
