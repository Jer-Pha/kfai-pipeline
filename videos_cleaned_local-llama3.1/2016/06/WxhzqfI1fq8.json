Steep isn't for me, I'm interested to see how that game does, but it's super pretty and it's really quite interesting that they were excited to announce it at the end. I mean, I'll be interested to see like what everyone's take is on that because it just doesn't seem like this is a like they are talking about this game like it's going to be a huge game for them. I just don't see that happening. No, that that I honestly do not think looks good at all. I mean, I like Esports stuff like that, like I like snowboarding games and that doesn't look fun, that looks like a really dumbed-down version of a snowboarding game because there's also skiing, there's also Wingsuits, there's also this and it's like that's not fun and like the",

But even their entrance was too long; it's like, let's have them come out from the sides, get to the point real quick, 'cause when they were like, \"I did Trials, and I'm the king of F,\" I did Blood Dragon, I was like, \"Okay, are you making a... Oh, you're combining your games? Okay, that's cool. But like, yeah, why don't we just punch you in the face and tell you about it? Why don't we just give you the good stuff right away?\" I mean, even the South Park stuff, which was fantastic - my God, why was it so long?

I mean, I do want to give a shout-out to Aisha, though - like, I think that having somebody like that crack the jokes and actually understand what the hell is going on really does help with everything. It just was way too drawn out, and whatever, like the interviews were so unnecessary. Like, the Star Trek thing - cool, we don't need to talk to Idris Elba about it, yeah, I know. Like, that's the thing you had a polished package of them all talking about it great, why did we watch that just to have Idris come out and say it all again?
