It's basically the way I like to describe it is Asteroids meet soccer okay so you're flying this like little uh character around. The only way you can influence the ball in the court is by shooting at it yeah uh there's different rule sets - just one ball, some three balls. But basically you got to get them in the goal of your opponent uh typically it's first to 10 wins is default rule set okay um there's also three levels of shot you can charge your shot. The first one is just like a little impulse just moves the ball a little bit. The second one kind of if you get the shot just right can kind of keep dribbling it along and the third one puts this massive impulse into the ball but if someone else shoots it it could be deflected right back in your face high risk High reward gotcha I know that's what you guys are all about here absolutely we put it online every day is right Nick it looks like they",

Oh God, sub thing about the physics... your movement speed factors into the shot velocity, godamn it! So you're really cruising along, shoot that gets a part could have rejected still reject it. Oh, you see this nasty defense that I'm setting up? We need some defense back here. Greg's coming in, yes.

I'm sorry, I didn't understand your question. If you hold it down, it'll make an obstacle; it'll make that like that barrier. So this is where things get super real, like me and Greg were doing a match that lasted like 25 minutes. Yeah, it was a long time. What's a good one for a good step up but not going to be...
