If you never watched a Kinda Funny reaction, the idea is simple: we will do a spoiler-free section here in the beginning where we talk about the movie without spoiling it for you, then we'll say it's going to be spoiler town and we'll jump in and spoil the entire movie so you can come back and watch after you've seen the film. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside producer Nick Scarpino, hello. One of our other hosts is Tim Gettys, let Tim host, and then our friends from IGN, Mike Aransky - you remember him from the Game Over Greggy show? He's a huge Ghostbusters fan; you all saw his movie, good job on that! And over here, Sean Finnegan, hello everyone, how's it going? Sean Finnegan likes hiking. I do the Shark Week thing because he eats up content. We have seen Ghostbusters; we saw it in 3D. We will now go around in a circle starting with Nick. Nick, what did you think of",

Nick, what did you think of Ghostbusters? Your synopsis, elevator pitch, spoiler-free so I thought it was exactly what I thought it was going to be. I thought it was going to be Bridesmaids with ghosts and that's exactly what it was. That's not to say it's a bad thing if you're a huge fan of Paul Feig, you like his that particular brand of improv humor. I think you're really going to like this movie. I thought there were parts of it that were really funny. Um, I thought there were jokes that made sense. Thought there were a lot of jokes that fell flat. Um, and I thought that the ghosts themselves um were kind of secondary to the overall experience of it which is kind of what you expect from a Paul F movie. My problem with what you say is you every time you say you sound like you don't like Bridesmaids but you say you do like I",

My problem with what you say is, every time you say you sound like you don't like Bridesmaids but you say you do like I love Bridesmaids. I want to make sure Bridesmaids is a particular type of film making that is really really signature of Paul Feig - let your actors improvise, let's have some fun, let's veer from the script. Whereas Bridesmaids, what Bridesmaids did do great was it had a great story, had great character development somewhere in there um but I think that was that's kind of the stuff that was structurally written into that film and couldn't be changed and so but in this film I don't think I think it was a lot looser and so when you had improv I think I guess I just kind of missed the days and this is I guess you put it perfectly when we first started this film, we like this is just what comedy is now.

Sure, I miss the days when um two really talented writers and not to say the writers in this film weren't talented because you know I'm sure some of the jokes were theirs. Um but I miss those days when they would structure a really adult fun story and then have some characters that can make it into a comedy like The Original Ghostbusters. I I I screwed this all up myself, so we'll get off that. We'll come back to this stuff because I still don't think you like Bridesmaids the way you talk about it, and I don't, and I like I'll go next. He doesn't believe you. I had fun at Ghostbusters. I think I liked Bridesmaids a lot. I don't think this was nearly as good as Bridesmaids or anything to that effect. So I I had fun with this though.

I don't think it all played well, there was some stuff that I like Nick said, I thought it felt flat, there was some stuff that I thought they ran into the ground and it really fell flat, and then there was other stuff where I found myself laughing and enjoying myself. So overall, I thought it was, I thought it was pretty good. Like I wasn't as let down as I thought it would be, and I, I don't think there's anything in this movie that deserves as much hate as it's been getting on the Internet stuff yeah I agree to that, I definitely agree to that.

We've talked about this for about a year on this show, and I thought I thought we talked about before the trailer, but um, I thought this movie was 2 hours of the trailer.

It's Ghostbusters, all it was an action scene and worse, like you said, it's a poorly done action scene. It's a lot of green screen, total CGI fest. You can tell that like Paul Feig was like, \"Hey, so what we're going to do is just animate these ghosts around you.\" So, just kind of swing your arms around. Yeah, we'll add a blue over here and we're going to add a green over there. Um, and then multiply that. There's no weight to the ghosts, like when you pretend to pull on them, they're not like you're pulling on anything. The characters don't look like they're pulling on anything. And then there's this thing about the rules, like what they throw them on the ground and then they're dead. Like, why? Who knows what tech allows for it to be that way? Why is it like that? How do you kill a ghost? Popped one of them so that was 'cause it was a balloon or whatever. Well, that was because there was",

Well, that was because there was... but that's the whole thing - I don't know about the balloons for the balloons; still not sure if they were ghosts or if they were balloons that were possessed by ghosts or whatever. That's how I read it - when you first have a ghost control an inanimate object, that's when that's established right? So I thought the ghost had just inhabited these things, so popping him might've destroyed the thing but the ghost is still alive probably flying around... or is it? The one thing that kept playing up in this movie - and granted we saw it once or whatever, I won't see it again probably - is the fact that like they \"pumped\" up the ionization or whatever they kept driving that home.

And granted, they did that, but then that's why it's all broken - is like okay, so why with these other guns were they able to kill these ghosts, but they had to trap the demon ghosts or the Gozer Ghost or whatever that was? Yeah, so another thing in terms of setup and lack of punchline and all that. So Chris Hemsworth character, yeah right, gets taken over - maybe the best part of the movie, all ****, but he also is very, very over um, but so he gets in front of the whole army or whatever, and then you know kind of possesses them, mhm, goes like this, yeah, and then they all go like this, why, yeah, why he possessed for the credit scene no cuz they did that no cuz they did that for the real scene and then we're probably like\"",
