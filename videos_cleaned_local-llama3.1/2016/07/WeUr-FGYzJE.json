I only have one shirt that that is that specific color; it's more of a pink shirt at this point 'cause I've washed it many times. Yeah, it was a red, and it turned into Heather Red and then it turned into pink. But I think that there's like you know to a lot blue is pretty much uh it's probably a pretty commonly used color when it comes to clothing because it's a superior to the color; it's a great color, but like a lot of people look better on Earth Tones too, a lot of people like the greens or the Earth Tones, but I don't know.

Um, I bring this up because my girlfriend Gia; she once questioned me. She was just like Tim, \"Like you, you should not have a favorite color like that.\" Like, that's a 5-year-old thing, not a 27-year-old thing. I mean, certain colors if you're really following fashion, certain colors do come in like there are certain color palettes that are in for spring, winter, and fall. People love tie-dye right now. Do they? I don't know; I don't know either. No, I can guarantee they don't. I went to this fancy uh seafood restaurant, and they were all the waiters and waitresses wearing tie-dye, that was a Joe's Crab Shack.
