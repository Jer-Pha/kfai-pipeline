We don't really know what that is; it sounds like kind of like a mini PSX, but uh yeah I'm sure it'll just be come play all these Xbox games yeah get cool off in here play these Xbox they haven't said there's going to be an actual like conference though even at their own thing you know what I mean? But there won't be right; you can't I mean they made a stink about not doing a conference at Gamescom, so this would I would think this would just be their way to get fans controllers have play but I mean did they say that they weren't doing one at all like I that's the same thing as like",

You have these three things to work with: whereas with Microsoft having forever ago given up on trying to be a big deal in Japan, Tim doesn't matter to him. Gamescom they go there and we speak directly to the fans. Here's all the games that you know Dead Rising 4 was playable on the floor and here's the new Forza and here's what's the Pirate game I can never remember the name of Sea of Thieves these are all over here at E3, and now you get to get your hands on them over here.

Think I think I think it's I think I think with something like Rockstar because I think they have so so Take-Two has Take-Two has the time and the inclination to make a lot of take a lot of risks right, like they made they made an exorbitant amount of money on Grand Theft Auto V. They make money on a lot of their games; 2K publishing makes its money or whatever. So I think that like Red Dead is one of those games that they could literally announce in the same month they release it, like and I'm not saying that that's necessarily going to happen but I think it's like one of the few games that they could absolutely positively get away with doing something like that um and I do not think it would affect sales at all like I think that it's a",

Now, like I just would love the idea of them just saying, \"Like in September even being like The Game's real, it's out next month.\" What do they lose by that? Like the only thing they risk by doing this is they eventually have to submit it to ratings boards and they have to get it QA and that, that, and then certify it. And that risks getting trophies and achievements leaked and all that kind of stuff. So they have to play the game very carefully in that respect. How early do you need to do that? Cuz I'm not too informed on like the back process of all that stuff. Like what does that look like? How long do you need to send that in for, for ratings boards for the trophy stuff for the ratings for all that stuff?

Because Red Dead is one of those games where it's like if it comes out in the middle of November, it's going to sell millions and millions and millions of copies - it doesn't matter. You know?

Um, I think November's too late, like I said, because they're risking huge leaks from Foxconn and all these guys. It's not beyond reason that NX is already being manufactured, so you risk losing control the longer you wait. So, I think they have to do it soon; it might even be in August. Like I said, I don't think November's too soon at that point; there'll be leaks and pictures of this thing coming out. Yeah, see, I like November because I think you get on the other side of what you're talking about - people are playing games, but they want to hear about something new beforehand. In September, I feel like you do have it of like that's great; I'm also excited about this game, that game, this game... you get on the other side of Black Friday and it",

I think this is why the game awards do get such a big pop and do get so many trailers because people are ready to be excited again because we've gotten through everything we knew is now out, we have all all of our dreams have come true and we either love them or hate them but we have them and that's the end of that. We need to look ahead to next year to about what to be excited about I think in addition to that it gets beyond the uh Xbox Series S and potentially the PlayStation 5 because I think obviously those are going to kind of take away a lot of the market share in terms of the hardware",
