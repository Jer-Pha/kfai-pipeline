And the best of all, Greg won't be there. Get all the details at KindaFunny.com/SDCC. Topic two: Pok\u00e9mon Go again. Now here's the thing - last week we talked about it very briefly. Very little was in the topic of what are we playing now, and I was trying to play it, but there were server crashes and all that. So I had very little experience with it, and that was the day it came out. So it wasn't nearly the phenomenon that it is now. And last week, it has taken over the entire world, it seems like every social feed, every newscast - me and Greg were at Ramen, and we're seeing a freaking Pok\u00e9mon on ESPN. I mean what's going on in this world? It's been so crazy; it's fantastic. Shout out to Team Mystic. So all the other teams... y'all let's start. How much of it have you played, cuz then I want to",

But my friend Cur and his girlfriend Shie is obsessed with it more than he is, and he loves it too. So they'll be out every morning I wake up and I just hear the freaking Pok\u00e9mon theme music playing because they're in the other room booting the app up. I'm like this is awesome because it's just getting people engaged, and it's like I feel like so many core gamers are bitching that it's like oh there's no game here and I got I got bored in a minute if you get bored in a minute you're not doing it right, like it's not about the gameplay like the the gameplay is very minimal it's just collecting them it is and it's it's more about just using the app as you go about life like it's it's an",

And what's interesting to me is I've learned more about this game from random people on the street telling me what to do than anyone else, and that's insane. Like I was at Buffalo Wild Wings a couple nights ago, and someone saw me with my phone and he's like \"oh dude, hey you no, no, you're doing this wrong - you got to make sure that when the circle's in the right place, that's when you do it.\" I'm like \"oh man\" and I did that, I'm like \"cool, didn't know that\". The game does not tell you that at all. Yeah, that was a big takeaway for me - Aaron downloaded it when we were in Las Vegas, and she was like \"I don't understand this, give me the phone\", like like that, like your dad stepping in.

I think they did, but I'm going to look yeah, look up like an Niantic CEO interview from like two days ago. But uh, I really respect the **** out of this game, like I do. Like I'm not I'm not going to sit here and lie about now it's like ruining social media for me, but like so I ruin social media for people all the time with during football season stuff, so I'm not saying anyone's doing anything wrong.

Um, I wonder what Nintendo's agreement with uh you know, Pok\u00e9mon Company, Nintendo, and Niantic is in terms of splitting the money. I'm sure it's very advantageous to Nintendo. So, a lot of respect for them to found this. There's ways for them to build on this to sustain it - that's my big question: are they going to be able to sustain it because the game is shallow? So real quick time out, trading is coming according to the business I thought they announced that it yeah it broke recently so um but the thing about it sustaining it to your point in like capitalizing on it I think is the fact that they already are so great with the updates you know me always talk about how hard it",

Yeah, and you level up too. I think you get more when you level up. That's what everyone was saying. When you level up, you get a lot of them. When you catch Pok\u00e9mon, you get them. You get them a lot, but then also Pok\u00e9Stops are everywhere \u2013 okay, like there's one a couple blocks away or a block away. Sure. Yeah, I... I love this game; it's an interesting game.
