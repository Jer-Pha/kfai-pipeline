We put up the first ever kind of funny doodle under our new banner of us doing them, posting over on youtube.com/kindafunny. It's about 100 bears invading San Francisco. And we thought the best way to complement that was by doing a let's play of Bears Can't Drift. Amen. Now, I got a couple things here, Greg. First off, I already love this game. Why? Just the look, the sound, all of this. It's speaking to me. It's speaking to my childish heart. Second off, I appreciate the exclamation mark before the question mark. Me and you have thought about this many a time. And by that, I mean, there was one time you corrected me and maybe put the question before the exclamation mark. And I was like, no, cuz I'm exclaiming more than I'm questioning. The question is more of like the end part of it. So, every time I've ever written whatever",

I'm Greg Miller. Here we are playing Bears Can't Drift. Right now, what's exciting about this is that made primarily by one person, his name's Aaron. He just helped me through on the Skype getting everything set up the way it was. Uh what's interesting about it though and what speaks to you is that it's a game inspired by Crash Team Racing. They say that in their press stuff here. They specifically say Crash Team Racing, not Mario Kart 64, garbage, not Jack and Daxter's Marvelous Card Adventure, Combat X, whatever the **** that was called. Crash Team Racing, aka the best kart racing game of all time. Now, what's interesting about it, and that was",

There are no menus. There are no there's no handholding. They say there's no text. The whole thing is you have you look at this and know which kind of course you want. Now I'm going to start you cuz you're a little wuss over on just the normal courses over here. Now just so you know this reminds me a lot of Crash Team Racing. That's how the gameplay is. Yeah. You drive around as you have the world map. Open hub world here. Yeah. I love this game. This is it. This is it. So this is on PlayStation. This is happening. It's coming to PC and it's on Steam Greenlight right now. Really looks like Crash Team right now.

So, first thing I noticed, yeah, we're going modern controls for games. So, the R2. Yeah, you're following me into the hole now. Gotcha. R2 for gas, L2 for reverse. Uh, circle is going to be drift. I don't know how I feel about that. It's how every game should play. Just calm down. Yeah. X to go, square to reverse, shoulder buttons to attack. No, this is a new day.

No. I'm I'm going to go into the options like an adult and see what I can do here. The options are just like Crash Team Racing. These bears, they can't drift. They can't pause.
