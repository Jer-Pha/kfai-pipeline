It does me good to be here today, it does me good to see you; it's been too long. I was I was off at RTX in Austin, Texas, thank you to the hundreds of you that came to panels, came out to see us, came to autograph signings, did all the crazy **** with us there at RTX, thank you for your support, amazing as always Colin. What did you play while I was gone? That's a good question. Oh uh Adventures of Mana V, the Vita stealth release from last week. So this happened; this was released the day well the day of the last posting of PS I Love You. So we know what was going to happen; um a I mean I don't know what Square Enix is thinking with this uh why you would just not say anything and then release it and then put the PlayStation blog post up, no no hype, nothing. Now I appreciate that they released it; people asked them to release it and they did but why I don't",

Um, so scratching a specific itch, it's not like a great game but I I think it's fine. Um, it's good. The thing was and I tweeted about this this weekend was that I reached a point in the game where I was actually trapped and this was a this was like stuck like a game-breaking bug and this was actually something apparently in the original I don't remember this but because of the RAM limitations of the original game and the perceived limitations of this particular game if you go through a locked door and then go use a key on it and then go a few screens away then the door locks behind you so I was trapped in Glaive Castle or Castle Glaive.\"",

And I was just totally stuck. And I started looking about, looking around on this, and people were having the same problem - not only on this version of the game but on Final Fantasy Versus XIII the original second DS version as well on Game Boy, and uh it's in this one too. I, I, I just don't understand how even if it's a straight remake how you have like I don't even... I was telling Aaron because Aaron's the one who figured out how to fix this - I was saying you texted me that you're going to rip Square Enix a new one today and I said why. He said game-breaking bug, and then you texted back \"L Aaron just figured it out.\" Yeah, so this is a good story but but uh um you know I I I I don't",

It's not 1985 anymore, or 1990, where things do break in games and there's no way to patch them and there's no way to know and stuff. I mean, there was you know even though I think the original Metal Gear had a famous game-breaking thing, there was there was like there's a lot of stuff. The last game I remember of any consequence having a major game-breaking bug was Other M on Wii, which had a huge game-breaking bug in it. Yeah, um if you did certain things yeah and you had mail on your SD card to get them to fix it.

And I'm like, \"****, you know how long did you spend being **** in the castle?\" You think I ran around that castle probably 3 hours trying to make this particular enemy spawn. I tried to make so skeletons drop keys; you have to buy keys and for people that don't have SoA (Advent of Ascension), you have to buy Keys, like there are locked doors, you have to these things called keys and these things called mics, um, that are pickaxes and keys, whatever the mic eventually is replaced by when you get the morning star; you can use it to smash walls but you can get trapped by not having madx too, you can, but with the keys, you.",

So anyway, that's the philosophy of that story. I was in Dark Souls, I was furious. Are you still playing it? Or are you, yeah well I haven't played it since when she fixed it. I was like, all right well I'm going to go. I watch Kirby enthusiasm, we're watching Kirby: Triple Deluxe all the way through again. But you think you're going to get back to The Secret of Mana? Oh yeah, I like it and and I want to encourage see this is the kind of thing where I'm like I am Setsuna is another Square game that's not coming to Vita now it's coming to PS4 came to Vita in Japan and it's a it's a beloved Chrono Trigger-like role-playing game that",

I really, really like that game. Yeah, I like the progression of like earning more unlocks, like just playing till you die trying to get better chains doing all these different things. Cool, good job. Yeah, I have to uh, I have to get that on my system; it's uh amongst the the games in my download list, the never-ending download list. What um, I guess we'll get into it.

Number two, speaking of PlayStation Plus, Sony has revealed just how many paying subscribers are currently reaping the benefits of the service. Sony's Andrew House revealed that the number sits at 20.8 million paid subscribers, which constitutes around half of the PlayStation 4 user base. Though it's important to note that PS+ can also be used across PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita as well. So in other words, it doesn't necessarily mean everyone on PlayStation 4 is half of PlayStation 4's audience; there are still people using PS3 and Vita. Prim assuming all 20.8 million subscribers paid $49.99 for a yearly subscription, Sony is grossing roughly 1 billion dollars annually from the service. Damn son, not bad.

Do you two feel it's good to support the game when it releases on PlayStation to show what a mistake they made releasing it on Xbox or should we boycott it to show the developer/publisher that it isn't cool siding on a certain platform and holding a game off for another? No, that's silly. These are business decisions I think you have to make. My take is you have to make the decision based on what you want to play. You know if you want to play Rise of Tomb Raider, I'm going to play Rise of Tom Raider on PS4. I intentionally held off to play it on PS4 um I'm not ashamed of that.

But you have to make the decisions that are best for you for the reasons that you think are best. And so if you want to boycott it, to send him a message by all means do that. But I, I think that's a silly thing. The fact that we're getting Tomb Raider and Dead Rising at all or we think we're getting get any Dead Rising we and it has confirmed um it's just indicative of the environment that we're in right now.

Talking about Housemarque, Super Stardust is apparently coming to PSVR, just throwing that out there now. How do we figure that out? There was like some listing some weeks ago can't bring it up so unconfirmed I think but someone will write in and say so. I played it and I like it. There's a narrative angle there that's not in the other games. I will say that I think Dead Nation is a better game, really. I think it's tighter, I think it's easier to digest. See, I think I think Housemarque fell for the trick of scope um but I don't necessarily believe that that means substance like I remember playing Dead Nation over and over and over and over again.

And I know that's a weird complaint, because people get mad at me when I say Witcher 3 is too dense. With Housemarque, I'm like I need something that's a little more about the hook, it's not about the progression, it's actually about the hook you know Stardust is not about anything other than multiplying scores and so is Resogun, it's not about upgrading your ship and doing all this kind of ****.

So I stopped playing it after restarting, corrupted my save, I'd be like... this, I'll never play it again. And the problem is I feel like Alienation could have been my favorite of the Housemarque titles - cuz I liked all that. I did like the progression, I liked leveling, I liked feeling like what I was doing mattered permanently. Whereas like Dead Nation, I always felt like it mattered for that run of the game and then it was over and I was back to square one, kind of thing.
