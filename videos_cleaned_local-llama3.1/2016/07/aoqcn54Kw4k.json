Um, 505 Games is also releasing Haven on July 1st on Xbox One and July 8th on PS4. I'm going to say it's finally coming to PS4. Um, yeah, I feel like... uh... Rocket League that's going to be a nice way for them to make some supplemental income. These are for people that again like games on their shelves. It's the same reason they're releasing Shu (note: likely referring to Shu, a game by 505 Games) Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see how many people... for Rocket League buy it. Oh I want to support them and I want it on my shelf and how many people are like the people you're talking about Colin who don't buy digital games have heard about Rocket League obviously and now it's they're on a disc they see it at Walmart like why not I'll pick it up. My suspicion is we can just ask Jeremy in a few weeks and find out well there you go we should do that Jeremy expect a phone call.

So I think IM is Setuna is certainly going to be up there. I think that game is going to be great, yeah. I mean everything so far looks like they're just nailing it - it's being made by people who obviously care about the genre and what it meant to them growing up and playing those games, like down to the music, down to the look of the character designs and just their outfits and everything, like the way that it's written. Man, I'm very very stoked about that. And it does seem like the perfect VA game, yeah. It does. Square Enix is so inconsistent with this **** but I really do feel like that Adventures of Mana release is weird on Vita - they didn't talk about it until the game was out and I feel like maybe they'll do the same thing.",

And then that trailer; that trailer floored everyone at E3. Everyone walked away being like, \"That game looks awesome.\" Yeah, I guess they announced July at that conference, but July now seems a lot sooner than it did in June.

So, yeah, will this bring people in? Will they get into it? Will they care about it? We'll see. So interested in what their numbers are as well. Yeah, the real numbers, not the number of registered players. You've had great What is... what's your No Man's Sky PlayStation 4 Kevin stoked August 9th, yeah.
