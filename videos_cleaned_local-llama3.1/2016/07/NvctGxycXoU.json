No, is that what that 16 champ level? 16 not as bad, not as bad as me thinking that was a Venus thing. Steven Carell says, \"What games are you guys most excited to play on VR?\" You Valkyrie homie. I mean at launch of PlayStation VR it's Resogun for me like Resogun infinite. I when I played that at PSX last year man, that that was the first time put on the unit took it off and I was like that was a game that felt like a real game that didn't feel like an experience that felt like something I would sit down and play hours of yeah maybe not all once but for",

Franklin Seymour says \"Hey, Franklin, how did the quality of voice acting get to where it is today?\" You take it more seriously, more room to run the audio, more intent on storytelling. I people directing games like making directing cut scenes, directing it like a movie. Yeah, I mean you remember even like voice acting was compressed and there wasn't a lot of room to dedicate to it back in the day as well. So um I think I just came to that it just became important the more important storytelling became and the more the high fidelity of the audio became uh a touchstone of these storytelling games and these narrative driven experiences. I think that that was just a natural evolution of that. I think when people started calling it out too and talking about it, and that was a that was a pro or it was a con you know.

And people saw that, developers saw that, publishers saw that, and started putting a premium on that as they saw the fact that oh, people are talking nonstop about Metal Gear Solid because they love these characters and they love the way it played out. Whether you know what I mean, how can you look at Vulcan Raven and not love his voice acting? It's true, it's very true. Yeah, it's funny to look back at voice acting in games and you look at things like Resident Evil, obviously was uh one yeah but it it was such a joke but it was also such a big deal because it was novel and like as bad as it was it was still like oh man, like there's there's voices in this, this is this is crazy, this is oh man, it's like watching a movie but",

The only reason would be name recognition, but everybody calls it Red Dead, so anything you put after Red Dead... Um, but God, I hope they don't do that. That would be so dumb. But what they can call it is \"Red Dead\" and I'll still play it. Um, Red Dead sandwich? No, they literally just call it \"sandwich\" and I'll still play it. Um, but like, so like that game is going to clearly be announced; that game has been in development for years. Why don't we know about it? Like what's the big deal?
