I assumed reasonably that Gene would be overjoyed at the development, a manifestation of the conversation with George Takei that he had had long ago um during The Original Series where he wanted there to be a gay character on the show. He was, he alluded to the fact that you know he thought that would be a good idea but of course back then that was a different time and they already gotten a lot of flack from the first interracial onscreen kiss right um that saw that that had a lot of problems um just as far as like not being aired in certain areas because of of of the inherent racism involved in that um except Gene wasn't Overjoyed uh he had never asked for Sulu to be gay in fact he much preferred that",

Uh, he had never asked for Sulu to be gay; in fact, he much preferred that he stayed straight. Uh, quote: \"I'm delighted there's a gay character.\" He tells The Hollywood Reporter. Unfortunately, it's a twisting of Gene's creation, uh, to which he put so much thought. Uh, I think it's really unfortunate. Uh, later explained that Roddenberry was exhaustive in conceiving his Star Trek characters; the name Sulu, for example, was based on the Sulu Sea off the coast of the Philippines, as to render Asian nationality indeterminate, and that Roddenberry had always envisioned Sulu as heterosexual. Um, so that's interesting in and of itself, but then the Simon Pegg sort of came back with his response, which was: \"I have a huge love and respect for George Takei; his heart, courage, and humor are an inspiration. However, with regards to his thoughts on Sulu, I must respectfully disagree.\"",

Whereas I remember seeing the reboot and be like \"this is awesome, this is great.\" Since technically it's a reboot, but it's still in that timeline, you know what I mean? Like they went back and changed everything in the show. Was there ever a storyline where Sulu was pursuing a woman or anything like that? No, they had so apparently they had... they alluded to the fact that he had had an affair with a one-night stand with a woman, and that resulted in the birth of his daughter, but that was in I think that was in one of the movies, not got um.

Where I feel like I am surprised by that but also am of the mind that like the character, like I would have liked to see you know if we want to have more diversity in terms of sexuality, which is great and it's not within Gene Roddenberry's original idea then I think it would have been appropriate for them to make a new character. And I understand that you don't want to have tokenism and all that kind of stuff but this we can bring this to to to a further extent which is um is Sulu still an Asian man in the yes okay so why isn't he a black woman then, I mean it's the same thing it's like what George Takei is basically saying is like he is what he is right and Jean Roddenberry is is famous for",

I'm not a huge Star Trek fan but everyone knows that Star Trek was a huge huge step forward in television, not only for the science fiction genre but for television generally, along with I Love Lucy and a few others that were basically saying like this is biracial or this is all these kinds of things um and so he should be respected for that. So it's almost I don't want to say it's almost a slap in the face to him but it's almost like you know he already took so many steps forward that no one else would take and he wanted like and he already had made this Asian who there he was the first prominent Asian character on television not anyone can even name yeah so so it's",

Um, so like, I, I've waged this own argument in my mind or this own battle in my mind where I'm like, I just don't know exactly where I come down on it because there's no doubt that diversity in fiction has been positive for disparate sections of society but actually for fiction itself which I think is fantastic as well.

But I think with sexuality, particularly, if you look at polling and you look at different results around the states, uh, with gay marriage and all those kinds of things, and how quickly that turned around completely - within a decade it turned around completely. That's what I just was wondering: if like I do wonder if the gay population at large, I wonder if the black population at large, maybe not individuals or little sections of them, or parts of them are now saying, \"Okay, let's just be treated like we're normal and we don't need to be represented in every single thing to be treated as normal in society.\"",

That's what you always do. I guess you're right, yeah. No but that's a perfect point though, like with Gia, she doesn't want big proposals, I know she doesn't want the big proposals.

Let's go out of town.\" So she knew something was up, and I took her to a really beautiful hotel in Napa. Made reservations; I made reservations for everything so I knew that's what she wanted cuz my wife is a planner.
