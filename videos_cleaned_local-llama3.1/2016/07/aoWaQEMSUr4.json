I haven't been here in a minute. So, it's good to be back. Yeah. Thank you for having us. You had us. All right. So, let's back up a little bit. First things first, Greg's gone.

It's going to be good. You had us on uh podcast Beyond last week, so I thought it would be good to It was quite serendipitous, actually that Greg's gonna be. It's always serendipitous when Greg's gone. Yeah. But it's it was quite serendipitous that Greg was gone because I thought I'd ask you to come on the show and be with us today. Yeah. Thank you for having me. It's it's cool to be able to do that back and forth. We uh we we got to do that more often. So, for people that are unaware or unfamiliar, I think the Venn diagram is pretty much a circle as we say between your show Beyond and my show or our show here PS I Love You XOXO, but podcast Beyond hosted at IGN.

So, uh we just did the 450th episode of that show, which is scary. Um that you guys have done, we know we've done this many episodes. You're on a couple hundred yourself. And then I was I guested back on the olden days with you and Greg a bunch of times. Uh and now we've done I don't know what we've done like 55 now without you guys, which is it was very weird because not to get too in the weeds, but like we got on to episode 450. Hi, Portilla. Oh, I miss this little man. I know you don't. Uh we uh we got on episode 400, I think it was, and it was like time to celebrate 400. We've been here for 5 minutes, you know?

It's kind of like, and you'll appreciate this metaphor, but when uh Chris Terreri holds up a Stanley Cup, but he only played two games, dude. He came in once when Brodeur let up like a few soft goals. Y um Yeah. So, that was a fun episode to do. 450 was a good episode. I'm glad that Beyond is kind of morphing into it into your show now, your guys' show. There's I think PS I Love You XOXO coming online gave people kind of what the old show that they wanted and then there's a new show that he wanted and he can have the best of both worlds and I think a lot of you have realized that now.

He's at a meet and greet with the entire city of Los Angeles. He was having Did you see he was having a meet and greet uh in the Austin airport after RTX at like 6:00 a.m. Really? Yeah.

So, there's four pieces of housekeeping that I want to get through first before we begin. Uh, number one, Greg put this one in and it is essential news. Uh, we are going to Let's Play Live in Chicago with our Rooster Teeth brethren. Um, so you know, Funhaus and Achievement Hunter and all those guys. Um, we just did in LA right after E3.

Uh, second thing I want to throw out, and you probably saw this this weekend, Summer Games DoneQuick. Yes. Uh, raised nearly $1.3 million for Doctors Without Borders, which I think is fantastic. So, I wanted to congratulate the Games Done Quick crew. That's a really cool initiative that they got going on. They keep breaking their own records and raising more money for Doctors Without Borders and other good causes. So, I wanted to congratulate them. Yes, absolutely. I'll double that.

Like I was watching Link's Awakening, which is one of my favorite Zelda games. You love that game? Yeah. And it was just like watching people do **** in that game that I didn't think were possible is it's so cool to see. Uh so awesome. They're raising good money for a good cause. So yeah, support those dudes. Yeah. So I wanted to just throw that out there. And you can watch a lot of this stuff. I think that's all available on VOD if you like especially with older games like we were saying, watching these guys just break them and exploit them um in ways that a lot of games today can be broken and exploited, although they can be still.

Want to give a shout out real quick to Adam Boy who's the VP of third party relations at Sony, a friend of the show and a friend of a personal friend of ours. After four years, he has decided to leave PlayStation and so we want to wish him the very best. He does listen to this show and we do appreciate him very much as well. And then we got a fourth thing and I think Greg might be mad at me for this cuz it's going to start a precedent, but I wanted to do it anyway. Um, we got this message over at the forums, okay? And I wanted to read it. It says, \"Hi Colin and Greg. I know you guys don't really do this anymore, but I know that it would just make my husband Wesley the happiest guy ever and also make me\"",

You guys got him through late night study sessions. He's studying to be a mechanical engineer and has long days at work. I know if you gave him the shout out, it would definitely make up for the time I crashed his truck into the motorcycle and out of the back of our garage. I'm glad to know that when I hear him in his study room at 1 a.m. giggling, it's because of you guys and not because he is insane. Y P.S. My husband loves you and I want to be a cool wife.

The top 10 bestselling games digitally on PS4 were in order: Battlefield 1, Overwatch, Battlefield Hardline, Tomb Raider Definitive Edition, Minecraft, Middle-earth Shadow of Mordor, Seven: The Days Long Gone (which is the only new game on here), Rocket League, Grand Theft Auto V, and Need for Speed. So sales - this is this like since since the lifetime of the PS4? No, this is this is just for June 2016. Just for June 2016. So clearly sales were resonating along with a dearth of probably new games that people wanted to play.

Lot not a lot of people buying trash, so that's good. Don't buy trash. And then on VA, uh, top 10 bestselling digital games in order. God Eater Resurrection, Odin Sphere, XCOM: Enemy Within Plus, Adventures of Mana, Tales of Hearts R, Civilization Revolution 2 Plus, Steins;Gate, Soul Sacrifice Delta, Zero Escape, Zero Time Dilemma, and Child of Light. So, that's a really great lineup of games and also a uh um some new games in there as well. Yeah. also decidedly less AAA than the PS4 list. Absolutely. Cuz there's no such thing on PS, right?

No Man's Sky is officially gone gold, indicating that the core game is complete and ready to be printed onto PS4 discs and published to the PlayStation store. Word comes by way of Hello Games and studio lead Shawn Murray on Twitter. Sean also revealed that unlike some games, No Man's Sky passed Sony's certification in multiple territories the first time it was submitted and that the team is now working on the game's very first update. The long-awaited exploration game finally launches on PS4 on August 9th. Where's your mind at with No Man's Sky?

Speaking of optimism, number three, it looks like the upcoming Batman collection, Batman: Return to Arkham, is in more development trouble than initially thought.

Indeed, Eurogamer sources indicate that November is the earliest we'll see it, meaning it could conceivably be pushed to 2017. The port is being handled by Chinese studio Virtuous Games and frame rate issues seem to be the collection's major hindrance according to Eurogamer. Now, to their credit, as far as I understand about this, and people can correct me if I'm wrong, this collection is a little more difficult because they are it's they're porting the game to a new engine. So, so it is a little more complicated than merely upscaling and uprezzing the game as they are doing with like the BioShock collection. Yeah, it's not a simple drag and drop as they say.

Yeah, they bumped up a lot like if so basically if you open a photo in Photoshop and you go into the level section and you grab the little black square and you drag it all the way to right, you get a lot more dynamic shadows, but you lose a lot of nuance and color and and sort of the coordination between the picture elements. And it seems like they're doing that. And I'm not wild about that because I feel like those were pretty gorgeous games and there's a right way to do it.

The reason that I'm more bullish on Scorpio than I am on Neo is because, as people have asked and pointed out is because Scorpio seems to be a quantum leap.

And obviously all the first parties are about that. Microsoft and Nintendo aren't immune to that either. They all release really quality games out of their first-party studios. But, um, not always from the second party, but that's another story entirely with IP they own. But the way I look at it is The Getaway has this this love. It's a dormant love, but it's a love like from the PS2 era. I actually really thought The Getaway was awesome.

I don't necessarily think it's the best of its kind necessarily. It could be. Well, I think I think it's it's a lot more sort of jack of all trades and that's why it's very tough to go up against it because open world games have gotten especially if you look at Rockstar's, they've gotten to this insurmountable level of there's this height that you can't reach unless you do all of it. And GTA V ticks off every every box.

And I think that's good. Like I think that's kind of cool to get that hyperfocused less jack of all trades. But with an open world game there is that sort of connotations of you need to do this this and this. You can't do this. Oh, I can't get in a plane. I can't get in a bus. I can't parachute and poke hop and like that. People go it's worse than the other thing.

And it's across multiple platforms and it's supported by a massive behemoth company that really only supports that game and a few others.

Um that's going to be their next big thing. And what I thought was started about that is is they look at they looked at the environment and they're like open world role playing games we can have our own open world role playing game proprietary to PlayStation 4 and there are a lot of examples from Bethesda and others that you know from Techland and everyone that are making these open world games.

So to have a game like Grand Theft Auto, if if they release a game that was of an eight or a nine quality, they'd probably sell 5 million copies easily and probably closer to 10 million copies because those games are simply so huge that you have to assume there would be huge support but they could also **** the bed right We're also what two or three years away from when GTA 5 was released and they're in no rush to putting out a six anytime soon They're not even",

Ghostbusters has 11 bronze, two silver, nine gold, and a platinum. So, an interesting uh array. Nine gold trophies is a lot of trophies. Um, basically these seem pretty straightforward.

A lot of gold trophies if that's what you're looking for there. That game Last Wings that we brought up this on PS4 and VA has 10 bronze, nine silver, six gold, one platinum.

And the one that I was super disappointed in, so Insomniac sent us codes for Song of the Deep last week. Uh, the trophies weren't live yet.

Like when characters die off in The Walking Dead games, um, they're usually kind of inconsequential. So, I think there's a smart way to do it. I love that comic book idea.

I don't really know what loops and obstacles the PlayStation team would have to go through to get that done, but I feel like with the PS3 slowly dying and like you guys said, people who have a Vita more than likely have the games they want.

Here's what I can tell you about Deep Down that I know is that it is a game I played in Japan, I think before PS4 even came out. Um or the year the PS4 came out. Um so, here's what",

Um so, here's what it says on Wikipedia. Uh for people that don't know, Deep Down is being developed by Capcom. It's a PlayStation 4 exclusive. It's supposed to be like a role playing game, kind of like a Dungeon Crawler. And people were excited about it. I played it. I felt I thought it was stiff as **** And the only thing I remember about the game is that I was with some Japanese woman who could not tell me how to invert my controllers or how to play. So I was just running around like an idiot and she was totally laughing at me. Demos at Tokyo Game Show are always Yeah, they're pretty rough. Yeah. Also like no one gives a **** about us at Tokyo Game Show because it's for Japanese press and Japanese enthusiasts. So like we don't get any preferential treatment, so they just do not care.",

It's like they don't give a **** who you are, who you work for. Um so here's what it says on Wikipedia about development. Says, \"At the February 2013 PlayStation meeting, we were there at Manhattan where Sony debuted the PlayStation 4, Capcom's Yoshinori Ono, best known for his work on the Street Fighter series, revealed Deep Down alongside their new Panta Ray game engine, designed specifically for the PlayStation 4. Deep Down was the working title, and Panta Ray was announced to replace MT Framework as Capcom's game engine of choice. The revealed trailer showed an armored warrior battling a medieval fire-breathing dragon. They chose to make a new brand for freedom to explore next-gen video game",

They chose to make a new brand for freedom to explore next-gen video game console architecture, and so as to avoid limitations from consumer expectations. The game did not have a presence at the E3 2013 video game expo. During Tokyo Game Show 2013, Capcom producer Yoshi Ono announced that Deep Down was to be a free-to-play title. I think that's when I played it. The initial expected release date was to be in 2014 after a public beta coincided with the Japanese release of the PS4. In February 2014, the public beta was announced as being delayed to after the Japanese release of the PS4. In mid-2014, the public beta then scheduled for summer 2014 was announced as being delayed to 2015. In early 2015, Kasanori Sugiyama stated in an interview with Famitsu that the vision for the game has expanded since its initial 2013 reveal to better appeal in the long term",

In early 2015, Kazunori Sae Sugiyama stated in an interview with Famitsu that the vision for the game has expanded since its initial 2013 reveal to better appeal in the long term to players and so the development time scale has been extended. So, what it sounds like to me is that the game is in development hell. Yes, I think I think you nailed it. Um, there's a is that a a cultural thing by the way? I feel like in Japan it just it seems like they are given a little more freedom to just take their sweet ass time with the game for better or worse. The Last Guardian should be indicative of that. Yes, 100%. It could be. Yeah. I think there's more of a there is a culture of respect. What it's always the story that Jared tells about the window facing job or whatever.

Uh, so I Yeah, I think I feel like in America there's a lot more like we'll put the game out so we can start making the sequel and we'll get the next one right. Um, even in other territories, but in Japan it's just take your time. So, I don't know. I'm not so wild about a free-to-play game coming to my console like in I don't really care what it is.

There's no sort of defined law about when a game starts begging you for money, but it it always happens when it comes to something. Oh, yeah. Absolutely, dude. Yeah. I'd rather they get it right, but on the flip side, like, yeah, that's that's a long time. And yeah, throwing throwing more time and more developers at a game doesn't necessarily always fix it. So, a lot of people think like, oh, hire like 30 people, bring him in there. Doesn't always work. Nope. Absolutely not. My my theory is based on the timeline is that either the game has been restructured significantly behind the scenes or it is done. Yeah. Um and what",

While back at IGN, Colin talks so highly of Shinji Mikami's Vanquish that he convinced me to buy what I believe to be one of the best shooters on the PS3. To this day, many of my friends who had a PS3 haven't even heard of this criminally underplayed game, # Colin was right.\" And that's from Daniel. So, I agree. Vanquish should be the forgotten PlayStation game. Go play it on PS3. You can also play it on Xbox 360. Yeah, that was a dope game. It just I think it kind of just snuck out there and disappeared. It did. Someone told me this. I don't know who it was, so it's not an original idea from me that that would have been a **** dope G.I. Joe game.

I don't know if there's a way to play that on any current Genesis. I don't think so. Maybe backward compatibility on Xbox One, but I don't think so. I don't know. We can look it up. Who the hell knows? I probably should have done some research. That's fine. Final segment before we go. Singing a shoe.
