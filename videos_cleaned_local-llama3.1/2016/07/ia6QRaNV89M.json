So did Tim Gettys. By the time I got there, it was annoying for the game over that took it. Kevin raised his hand like he took it. I got you, kind of funny, Kevin, good job. Yeah, I mean, whoever is out there, real talk, go **** yourself, yeah not cool, yeah not cool at all they got you. I feel like I got Nick Scarpino this is the whole reason I don't use Snapchat, it's probably the whole reason I won't play much more Pok\u00e9mon Go also it's not the most interesting game everyone's crazy about it right now, night one was fun to have the Pok\u00e9mon on Portillo's head or whatever but never going to play it again.",

So the fact that it wasn't on um the iOS American app store for so long I think really kind of contributed a lot to its popularity. Xavier Woods wouldn't shut up about it every tweet from Austin, blah blah blah, where is it? Yeah, and uh again obviously it's Pok\u00e9mon so that's what's going to sell it alone but I think also the fact that it was all the biggest group didn't have access to it I think caused a lot of the stir and commotion.
