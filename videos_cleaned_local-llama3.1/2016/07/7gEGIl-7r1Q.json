But it wasn't even a trailer; it was just like the reveal of it being an underwater game. Clicked on Song of the Deep, got into it, and immediately fell in love with it because it's... it what I didn't realize I was looking for was something I talked about a lot with unfinished swan of gaming comfort food, like that. I always talk about; I think in my review of Unfinished Swan for IGN, I talk about um, it's like a cup of cocoa and a blanket, like it's one of those things like you want to hunker down with it and just spend it. And part of that I think is the fact that in Unfinished Swan someone's telling you a story, like very clearly; you know, I mean they're talking about the boy, they're doing all these different",

You can upgrade that and make it more powerful, make all these different things. Then yes, you get torpedoes at some point, and then you can upgrade them to have dual torpedoes for one shot. Then you get this like uh you get an ice blast that can freeze enemies or like you can use it in puzzles because there's puzzles to it too obviously where you can make when you freeze these like like I guess what do they call them warheads if you want or bombs, I guess mines once you freeze them they can then can like they become buoyant and so you can use them and move them around and blow stuff up like that. Um yeah there's a thermal detonation one out stuff like that uh you have a boost to you know swim faster which then comes cuz there's other times where it's like you got to try to fight the\"\n\nI corrected phonetic mistakes, spelling errors, and capitalized proper nouns like \"Torpedoes\" and \"Warheads\".

I know it's not important to a lot of people but to a lot of people it is important and I thought that was a it's not a turn off, I want to play the game, I've had I I the only reason I haven't played is because I haven't really been here but I was on vacation, but um so I've been playing Vita, but um that sucks. I saw like like like there's Collectibles and upgrades all like there's a million different ways you could have fleshed this out and that's the thing for now that I'm in the fact that it didn't have a platinum and I started off and I'm like oh it has it's ringing like unfinished Swan, I expecting that kind of experience and now that I'm more geez God I don't know 8 hours in",

Yeah, why is it that I'm going to upgrade all my things for a silver trophy when it should be that I'm upgrading through the entire tree? How does the upgrade system work because one of the complaints I've seen in reviews of the game was that uh the upgrade system, I don't mind this kind of upgrade system but I guess some people do is that like you have to kind of pick and choose the upgrades you have to use but eventually you are so experienced that you can just fill out the entire tree which to me is fine but a lot of people or like one review in particular I read really had a problem",

They made a bunch of crappy Crash Bandicoot games and then they got to where they needed to be. Understand? I mean, like you know, you learn, you go, and you grow.

Emerald weapons in the King's Glaive trailer, I can't wait for Final Fantasy XV. Here's my thing about this: I remember when X-2 came out and then there was a whole bunch of stuff with Shinra and all this and it was like does it link to VII? I love that stuff, that's great.

But uh, it's cool. I don't think Luna is goova; that sounds dumb to me. I also think it's a bad idea to cross lore between games as well, like between the universes... um, so like F10 and 10-2, obviously connected right?

They had stuff like Game Shark and other things, but again, like you can't... Game Genie what a **** Game Genie was awesome. That was a great product for people who don't know it exists anymore, and that was like a thing where you came with these books, and you could buy more books, and like there was this sequence of letters and numbers, and then it would be like here's infinite lives in Zelda or it changes the color palette or like it does all these things.

You take it more seriously, more room to run the audio, more intent on storytelling. I mean, you're directing games like making directing cut scenes, directing it like a movie. Yeah, I mean, you remember even like, like voice acting was compressed and there wasn't a lot of room to dedicate to it back in the day as well. So um, I think I just came to that it just became important and the more important storytelling became and the more through the High Fidelity of the audio became uh a touchstone of these storytelling games and these narrative driven experiences. I think that that was just a natural evolution of that. I think when people started calling it out too and talking about it, and that was a that was a pro or it was a con you know.

But there are certain games where I'm like I can't believe this like people don't understand this game and Mad Max is one of those games, oh my God, I just can't believe it you know that game's awesome.
