No, that's probably not the best. This do we have any uh lubricant? So Chris, Nick, today's question comes from 27-year-old Dominic. Dominic says every time that I ride the dragon, assuming he's talking about sex, um, I have really awkward awkward moments and I feel like I'm really messing up sex. How do I fix this? This is a good question for me because I'm really good at having bad sex, but I've learned from my experience. What what have you learned, Regal them? Um, you know maintaining eye contact is good the whole time or unblinking. I feel like that's what you do when you face a bear. You want to be honest for me, having sex is not that much different than fighting a bear. That's ESS, like that might be what you're doing wrong on the offset. Have you seen no, no? Have you have you seen uh the Revenant? Yeah, I did it's the same.",

It's just the cleanup, there's clean up and you've got to be aware of all that. If you're going to finish too fast, what I like to do is make sure you have stuff on the walls to read, like posters and stuff - you're like, okay, I'll keep reading the names and like, I wonder what that person's up to, the person who directed The Dark Knight Rises, for example. You think about different things and all of a sudden you're like, okay, good, I'm back, I'm good, got another five minutes - stamina be damned. I'll go for as long as I need to go, but I always make sure her needs are taken care of first. Again, I think again, I hate to disagree with you Tim, we very seldom",
