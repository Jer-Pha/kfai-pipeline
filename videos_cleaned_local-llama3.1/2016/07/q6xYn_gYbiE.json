No, it's because he didn't understand. He was like off the boat. Okay. Italian. And so like he didn't understand English as well as you and I do. So like it was literally a joke of my family that like this guy for years was just like, \"Hey Tommy, how you doing?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I'm fine. Good.\" He was a nice man.

It is very important uh cuz it's tailoring the experience to you. But then at the end like there's a few parts cuz what I've I've talked about before I think at the E3 demo coming out of this is that you can see all the different Batman in there in terms of like is it going to be dark like Frank Miller's? Is it going to be more what we think of like from the Bale movies of I won't kill, I won't do this, I'm I'm in this for this reason, that reason.

When I get my save, it's very much going to be the Batman I think of who would never do something like this or that. He would only do this. He's gonna do this. He wants to be well received by the Gotham up upstairs people that he wants to ever fear him down here. So, it's interesting. Really good. I enjoyed myself quite a bit.

So, Mystery Dungeon Shiren and the Wanderer came to North America at on in 2008 on Nintendo DS, which I think was the first time it was released here. Uhhuh. And then Shiren and the Wanderer came to Wii in 2010 in North America. And so, Shiren the Wanderers: The Tower of Fortune, and Dice of Fate is a VA game based on a DS game that was then re-released in Japan last year being published by Axis.

Um, it is an extremely it it it reminds me a little bit like and I know that there's games that are better analogues than it, but it reminds me a lot of Azur Dream, which is a PS1 game by Konami that I really liked where in that you go into this tower and you're trying to get higher and higher and higher up the tower and then you eventually retreat.

The top 10 bestselling games were in order: Overwatch, Grand Theft Auto 5, Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Doom, Mirror's Edge Catalyst, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, NBA 2K16, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, Destiny: The Taken King, and Minecraft. Overwatch's numbers don't include Battle.net sales; Doom, Uncharted 4, and Minecraft don't count digital sales at all, as Bethesda, Sony, and Microsoft respectively don't provide NPD digital data as of yet.

People come; they picked a good time to release Mirror's Edge, but it wasn't that great. Number two, not all is rosy, however, as console sales are now down precipitously year-over-year. PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U hardware revenue is down a combined 42% from June 2015, indicating that things could be softening in an otherwise healthy console market. Hardware itself is down 32% when not counting money earned in main. So, in other words, 32% down on hardware sold, specifically units.

Well, Xbox One right now is $250 to make way for the S. Yeah. Which will come out soon. And then uh do you assume Neo is coming out later this year and then next year we'll have the Scorpio.

An anime called Gravity Rush: Overture will bridge the story gap between the two games as well. And more information will be available on that soon.",

The game is consequential because Irrational Games made the sequel System Shock 2 which catapulted Ken Levine and his company into the spotlight culminating with Bioshock in 2007. Not to mention that the original game was directed by Doug Church who worked on Ultima and created the franchise and produced by Warren Spector of Wing Commander, Ultima, and Deus Ex fame. So, a lot of names and Epic Mickey and Epic Mickey of course is Warren Spector's uh over Yeah. his uh his Cudiglia. Yeah. Uh so, I never messed around much with System Shock. Game's significant.

And and what the point I'm trying to make is that coastal United States doesn't have the best internet in the world. It's just not true. Um, now I do take issue with the fact that like there is a hesitance that yeah, like you said, when all things are equal, that the digital future is going to benefit all of us. Um, if people think that they're going to turn on their PS4 in 10 years and it's actually going to work, uh, I would I would be shocked if that were the case for many people. So, you're hoarding these games. Everyone's always like, \"Well, what if they erase your PSN name or you like your G?\" And I'm like, \"Dude, you have a better chance of that of of like literally that happening to you.\" Let me back up. You have a better chance of your PS4 not working, I should say, than",

In other words, PS5, whatever these new consoles are going to be, you're probably going to be backwards compatible fully with PS4. You have to assume that they'll eventually work PS3 and all these other shits. And I was going to say that's what we said about PS4. We hope that it would be back. They could have done that, but they didn't because of competing market reasons why they didn't do that. I thought it was that I think there's What' you say? They remember they said they couldn't.

Like if you like laid an emulator over it or something like that, I I'm pretty sure it probably could. Um, but that said, uh, I think there's a literally 0% chance that the PS5 isn't backwards compatible with the PS4 digitally, whether or not it is with discs or whatever. So people are like hoarding these discs and hoarding this this this these catalogs of games, and they're like, \"Well, then I can play my PS4 games in 15 years.\" And I'm like, \"I don't think so because you're going to have hardware problems in in 15 years.\" What happens when your PS4 breaks?

And I think that I mean people are still playing things on Atari 2600 and things. I'm just saying like if you're one of these I'm I'm playing devil's advocate here. If you're one of the people who do want to have all your digitals and you're saying you're going to be playing PS4 in 15 years, maybe you will be the people who are playing games 15 years ago on those consoles and want the small percentile that wants to hang on to everything keep playing still are.

Um, there were 40 million PS4s in the wild when Uncharted 4 came out and it sold like 2 million copies in its first week. So, that's great and I'm sure it's sold millions more since then, but let's assume that like one in eight PS4 gamers has Uncharted 4. That's like the marquee PlayStation game, right? Yeah, one in eight. Let's say one in seven to be generous. One in seven PlayStation 4 gamers bought Uncharted. The marquee most anticipated PlayStation 4 game. Now, whittle those numbers down on PSVR to a million, two million people and the marquee title is going to sell a couple hundred thousand units maybe. Yeah, maybe.

This is where one of you goes to Kinda Funny.com/forums and submits your bad PSN name. This is your bad PSN name. Not something you saw online. Your name that you wish you could change, but Shuhei Yoshida will not allow you to do it. This one comes from an This isn't his PSN name, Colin. This is an equally bad Kinda Funny forum name of AVS Gibb. AVS Gibb writes in with a bad one. Uh, and I want you to let let him get to the explanation before you say this is this isn't that bad of a name, right? Okay. Hey, Colin and Greg.

They of course debuted a single not too long ago from a new album. They're here to put out another one and tell you a little bit about the album. Chris says, \"Hey buddy, this will be our last single release before the new album Control Plus Z is officially released.\" The song is titled April (the system fails).
