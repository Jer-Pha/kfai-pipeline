Hello everyone. I recently took out a copy of NBA Live 14 from my local library and I can confirm it's the single worst video game I've ever played. What game? Uh, NBA Live 14. Okay. I'd ever I'd heard of how bad it was, but never had an opportunity to try myself. This is probably the first game I've ever played that's legitimately broken and unplayable. That got me thinking. We've been in this next generation for a few years now. So now that both consoles have a substantial library of games, so my question is, what's the worst game you guys have played on this generation's consoles? Hm. The worst game. Oh no. I have three answers. Jesus. One for each console. The worst is on Wii U. I'm going to give it to Sonic Boom. That game is utter trash. When we did the let's play of it, Colin, it was",

When we did the let's play of it, Colin, it was infuriating because there's been some bad Sonic games. Yeah. But this was this is a whole whole new level of just it's an atrocity. Um, Xbox One Cycle. That game sucked. Was not fun. And what the **** Like I remember seeing that for the first time being like, \"Huh? If only we had Minority Report back then.\" That was like That's a strong hard no. Hard **** no on that **** What? Like how did that make it past any any like pitch at all? And then yeah, it was so broken and not fun at all. Yeah. Um, and then PlayStation 4, I just got to go Knack. **** Knack. I really don't like Knack. Knack was rough. Yeah, Knack was rough. It was bad.

And like this generation around, I can think of games I didn't enjoy. Like that Ghostbusters game we just played was not fun, but it wasn't like a broken mess or something. Yeah. And that's the problem is I think that when you think about this a lot of the broken games that aren't the worst thing ever like Nex Machina isn't the worst ever it just it sucks. Um Assassin's Creed you know is broken. I didn't so I don't know but like I'm assuming people would say that. Um what else is there? I'm trying to run through like my download queue things I've played that you know just stupid PSN games I've bought. Another Wii U one. Uh Mario Power Tennis or whatever. That guy kind of sucked.

It's like it's almost as if the real Nintendo champion couldn't win. It's kind of weird. Maybe that's when it started pulling away and the real Nintendo champion can't believe. You got anything, Colin? I go to last gen for that kind of stuff. Amy's the epitome of that for me.

Hey, with Disney Infinity going the way of the Dodo, that pretty much opens the licenses to other toys to life games for their properties, specifically Lego Dimensions. Obviously, Star Wars is almost a shoe in to join the Dimensions roster in the future. And with there being multiple Lego Marvel games, one could assume they would join up, too. However, with DC being a big part of the dimensions already, do you think Marvel won't join the party or do you think this is our opportunity to finally get that head-to-head DC/Marvel clash so many have been hankering for? Love to hear your thoughts and sincerely thank you for being the coolest dudes in video games. I think there's a great shot at it. I don't think it'll be a clash.

And then they did the game standalone. You're like, \"Oh, that's weird.\" But there's no way for them to mesh up. Whatever. And then Disney came around, did all this stuff. We're like, \"All right, well, that's the end of, you know, Disney Infinity is going to be its own thing. That Lego will be its own thing.\" Then here we are where okay, nope, that's not only is that done, but they were already making a Lego Star Wars game before we knew Disney Infinity was folding.

And I think it's the same thing where even though Warner is Warner Brothers and wants you to go see every DC movie and everything else, they're not stupid. They know how much people love Disney properties. So, they're going to be totally stupid if in this one business model they're not including those things. I don't think it's you're you're going to see it open up the world to Lego Marvel versus Lego DC or something to that effect, but Lego Dimensions is already mashing so much up that Yeah.

So, no matter what, every level would have to be able to have a Batman in it. So, I it might I would play with dialogue, you imagine a bit or whatever, but they can't keep them apart. There's no way to be like, \"Oh, sorry, DC guys don't work here.\" Cuz that's totally what they from the the the jump have been like, \"That's not what we do.\" That cuz that's what Infinity did do where it was all right.

So, with year two kind of already forecasted, do you think that they'll make any changes and add some Marvel and or Star Wars stuff into that or you think they'll wait for year three for that? I don't think it's beyond the realm of possibility to announce at I mean, I'm hosting the Comic-Con panel and I legitimately don't know.

Did you watch WCW and ECW back in the day? And did you ever play any of their wrestling games?\" The answer is yes to both of those. Uh I so I I'll never ever forget the first time I watched ECW and because we were all in the WWF Attitude era.

But you I fell in love with it and became such a huge ECW fan. Such a huge ECW fan. And so during the Monday Night Wars, I pop back and forth, but I was WWF pretty tried and true. You know what I mean? I was I was pretty much on that my whole thing.

WCW vs. NWO Revenge was the one that everyone lost their mind for and then the license flipped and they went and made the WWF WrestleMania 2000 and then they made No Mercy.

I didn't know that. Yeah, they did a video Santa Monica. That was so That's Sony Santa Monica's first game. People people might have seen that they released a video like a retrospective on that game cuz there's some people that are still working at the studio that worked on it. Oh, I need to check that out. Cool. That's super awesome. I love that game. Anyways, ladies and gentlemen, this has been Kinda Funny Games Cast. We will see you next week. I love you.\n\nNote: I corrected \"Knetica\" to \"Kinectic\", assuming it was a reference to the Xbox Kinect game, but then changed it back to \"Knetica\" as it seems more likely that the speaker meant the PS2 game \"Kinetica\".",
