The other side of this point for me is puzzle games, and that's where I'm actually really bad at them. So, like when when like I just don't don't see the fun in annoying the **** out of myself in these games. So I remember when Portal came out - um, in The Orange Box, that was like what fall 2007 - um, I was people playing; I'm like this is like like awful, like I I like and I'm like and I'm like and everyone's like this is this this game's so fun. I'm like no, I get it, like I I know you love it; I'm like I can't I can't like I'm like you know like I just I played it for like a half an hour before I got stuck and I'm like I don't and like it's not that hard like I just I don't this is so",

And I understand completely people wanting to be like well it's the same kind of feeling the same kind of rush at the end of a level where you're you know you figure it out or whatever. That's why when The Witness came out, I was like no way in hell I was like there's no way in hell I'm playing this game not because I don't believe it's good but because my brain doesn't it doesn't work with the game. It reminds me of the Adventures of Lolo Trilogy on NES which is like a beloved um puzzle game on the NES and I remember playing being like this is It's So satisfying when you when you're when you finish a stage, but is it worth the obnoxiousness that I feel in my heart right now you know when I could be playing when I could",

You know, like the boot... Last Resort, you have to land on everybody and kill right?\" The boots are used like, \"You're you're do you know anything about Downwell?\" So, Downwell people should check it out because it's really cool. It's a very mysterious Japanese indie game available on PC; it's on PS4, and I don't know if it's that it's available anywhere else.

So you use the gun boots to stay off the ground and land another enemy, and then the boots, and then you build up these like ridiculous combos and build up scores and all that kind of stuff. But even after I understood it and started playing, I'm like, I'm only marginally better at it now. You know, it's one of those games where I'm like, \"I'm a hardcore gamer, but I'm actually almost terrible at this.\" It's almost like the anti-pride \u2013 like, I'm ashamed it was my last flight where it finally clicked: don't shoot everything; bounce off of them.

I understand why people are bad at Mega Man, you know, I understand why people are bad at Castlevania it's very stiff but Ninja Gaiden feels perfect and so you can you can really judge a man or a woman on their gaming acumen by putting him in Ninja Gaiden and seeing how they do, seeing what happens. For me, it's first-person shooters I am so bad at killing things with that my aim is just off for some reason, just does not click whether it's mouse and keyboard or controller I just can't do it now that's why games like Overwatch are so great to me because I don't need to kill people it's all you know random objective based stuff totally into that but for some reason like even back in",

Yeah, I mean looking at the list of NES games, there's very few of these that I actually beat when I was a kid, a lot of them I went back and beat later. But yeah, me beating Zelda when I was little... there's not even a chance in hell of that happening. Mega Man still probably couldn't be beaten by me, I'm sure if I dedicated myself to it I could beat Mega Man hard as you think Mega Man 2 is easy, um Mega Man 2 is legit easy compared to the other ones, yeah Zelda 2... yeah right, I've yet to this day never beat Zelda... love that",

And then when it's your turn, when he goes to school or he's gone, and you play, then like you have a way better time at it than you should. What's super funny about that is back when DDR came out, I was super into that, and my friend Curran - totally not uh, this is back when he was fat, he was super not into it; he was just like, \"I'm never going to play this,\" and he never played it, and he just watched me play it for about a year.
