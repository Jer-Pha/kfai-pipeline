So I love you because you're just like hey let's just do all those things you want to do how to make them cooler this is how let's do it and it's great. I appreciate Disneyland for so many reasons; reason one being the production elements of it and like the animatronics and just the experience that they create, whatever and all that is is set design, all that is like production element and stuff.
