And I figure, as again, I want you to know, this is incredibly rare where all of Kinda Funny played your game. Usually it's like this comes around and Colin and I will both play it or Tim and I will play it or Nick plays Xenoblade Chronicles for 15 minutes on a let's play. Yeah, see, I'm not the biggest gamer, but when I saw this and they kind of explained the like what like a rough concept, what it is, I'm like, I want to sit down with this because I mean, I, I don't like experiences in games where it's like 60 hours where you have to basically give up a part of your life to play these. Come to that place. No, that's part of the reason why I enjoy the game is because I was like, oh, see for me, I come from more of a film background and I think that's what drew me into this game, Firewatch.",

I come from more of a production background as far as live action and now animated for some ungodly reason. We decided to do that. So for me to be able to sit down and actually play something that felt like I was in the middle of an indie movie was really cool for me. I don't know if that was an intentional thing for you guys to do or if that's just me bringing my own stuff to it. No, I mean, I think that's valid. Yeah. Um, I mean, I don't think we literally would put it in those terms, but it's definitely a game that's intended to be played in a few sittings and has really deliberate pacing and is really story heavy. Don't get me wrong. I mean, I played, it was gonna be like five hours to get through, but I just played through all the whole thing because I was",

Can you talk about without spoiling it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Then I would say, yeah, we're going to keep, this is our section where we talk about the game, but we'll keep it spoiler free. And if we're going to get crazy, we'll say something. Okay, cool. Um, Kevin's like, Kevin's like, I like this idea. Can we take a second to look at Kevin's leisure post today?

We'll talk about that later. His hand is definitely normal. It's normal. You fought a fucking, like a Leonardo DiCaprio from The Revenant right now. I'm sorry. Sorry. Now I'm drawing attention back to you. Um, what was I saying? Uh, you know, so the thing is about games like this, like this is a game about the, it's really character focused. And we wanted to make something that was really character focused, but inside of a plot that was actually happening to you. Not like what is the story of this space? Um, uh, not that that's bad.

Like there's just not a lot of stuff that like when we're talking about inspirations, we can talk about a lot of like mechanical inspirations and how to build the game inspirations. But what's it going to feel like we find ourselves talking about moments in movies a lot. So I think sometimes that comes through and making the game feel like moments in movies or moments in games that are absolutely not adventure games. And then, and then, and then they, they combine into an adventure game. Yeah. So, so I don't know if you want to share, but what were some of the inspirations for you guys?

It reminded me a lot of like that, that sort of moment in every action game where you're, you're through the thick of it and you get, you kind of come out into the Vista and you're like, Oh wait, I get to just sort of relax for a second. And this is something intriguing. This is also called my favorite part of every game. Yeah. So that's, that's what was cool to me was I was like, Oh wait, this is not going to necessarily, I don't want to spoil too much for people, but I'm like, I don't get the sense that this is going to be a game where I'm going to have to deal with a lot of quick time events.

This is not about action. This is more cerebral. This is more like about being in this world and really kind of understanding what it means to be isolated and kind of feel lonely and kind of feel like you're in your own space. We wanted to, yeah, totally. Sorry. I mean, no, no, no. So we wanted to hit that without being boring. We want to hit that without being like dull or we didn't want the game to also feel aware of that itself.

So that is co-op is the ultimate. So people, that's a misnomer when people talk about first person story. W w o p co-op. Everyone knows co-op. Everyone loves co-op. If you're a gamer, you know, co-op. Anyone should play co-op. Fun for the whole family. Yeah, we didn't. Where's I guess where's our fun? Oh, move. I was talking about inspirations. Yeah. What were your inspirations for this? Things we would talk about include Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation. Fincher, like David Fincher thrillers like Zodiac. Not so much seven.

Oh yeah. That's a really good reference. That's Duncan Jones. Right? Yeah. And I mean, so some in some ways you can use like Jack Nicholson's arc in The Shining. Yeah. Although he's got his family there. It's like it's sort of just more like. Yeah. But the stories of people who find themselves off in the middle of nowhere and then strange things happen. And then when it comes to Henry and Delilah's relationship, there's also some stuff that we talked about.

Those like those aren't movies that are going to like appeal to the gaming audience and Before Sunset is not like a match made in heaven. You always have to know that because you know who you're writing for. But there'd be times when I would think to myself, I love those movies and I've seen them dozens of times and I'm never bored in what they talk about. Those movies are also like the canonical text for the relationship that you know is fleeting but tell yourself isn't and is inevitably going to end. So I just go watch that and just like be with those characters for a while and go like, oh yeah, that's what that feels like. And I wouldn't so much pull out.

I mean, I don't, I have questions that are deeper that are going to spoil the game, so I don't know that I should really be asking them to be honest. Do you want to move into spoiler territory? We can enter a spoiler zone. Yeah, let's enter a spoiler zone. A spoiler zone. Put a spoiler zone. Are we going to be in spoilers on the rest of the show? You think? Maybe. I don't know.

So the, the, uh, I don't know if you guys watched our video review or like our review discussion of it. I watched part of it, but it came out a little bit close to the game coming out and I had to sort of turn it off. Well, I, so I don't, I didn't know. That's fine.

One of the things that I think is feedback from some people or whatever in terms of the relationship with Henry and Delilah was there any intent to let you meet her? Because it seemed like the ending of the game to me seemed empty without having a resolution with my relationship with her. It seemed like that's all I cared about almost was her. It wasn't even about my wife. So you had to see her for the relationship to feel like it had meaning?

My expectation was that she was like, my expectation was that she, regardless of the decision made was that she was going to, the payoff was somehow going to be like, because of the emptiness of the world, even though you see the two girls at the lake, you see the helicopter pilot or whatever and all that, you're like, you don't really see anyone. So I was expecting that like there was going to be something about her at the end. I mean, was there a consideration that, that to some people that might've been the huge payoff because actually everything else in the game to me was totally ancillary, not important.

He was the only animator on Ori and the Blind Forest. So this guy is a boss, you know? So I knew that like if we, we needed to go that route, we just had to schedule around it and we were going to cut other stuff and she was going to be in the game. And then I remember making Jake and Chris Remo consider it. I remember being like, let's think about this. And then every single time we were doing it, it was, we were doing it for the reason you're describing it. So people are going to want to see her. And I went, yeah, but then what does she say?

I mean, she's the administrator. Yeah. But no, there's, it's like, it's so the scene where she leaves where she like says like, okay, I'll stay. I was writing that and I went like, there's no fucking way she stays like this woman has been out here for 15 years because she is not the person who stays like she gets overwhelmed or feels a thing and just disappears.

Delilah, Delilah, when it was just, when the story existed as like plot beats as like index cards up on a board, Delilah being in the tower came in and out of the story, in and out as we were figuring out what the heck it means. But as Sean said, the more she became a character as we started writing and as sort of, we figured out what was her past life like, what is her relationship with Henry, why the hell is she actually out in this job, what is her relationship with like the good winds and how does that affect her?

He took the job to feel better. He just wants to feel better and he has no tools to do it. But then Delilah made him feel better. And like when she can't make you feel better anymore and it sucks and it's disappointing, it's like yeah, like that's the point. You know? Yeah well that's what I was, that's what I was, you know, like when I immediately finished the game last week, I remember talking to GameOverGreggy, it was late at night and I was like, we talked a little bit about it but we didn't want to talk too much about it to spoil this video we were going to do.

But then the more I thought about it and like, and thinking about it now, the emotion that the game evokes in me is sadness and disappointment, which is not necessarily a bad thing because when I beat Journey, I was hysterically crying and I didn't even know why, you know? Like, but like, and that's not a positive, that's not a positive thing. So I guess what I'm wondering is like, and I'm not saying that necessarily in a negative way where it's like, not every game needs to uplift or give you what you want.

So it's like, maybe it was my own, it was like my own just read of the game. Yeah, I mean, that's the thing, right? That's the sort of fun of fiction is that, you know, like it just hits you, you have just different needs as a human being.

But because, and because of that, you have a different relationship than you do with a film that you watch or a book that you read. But like, obviously from the very beginning of Firewatch, our goal was, are you stealing from the prize pack of Call of the Wild? We have plenty of free spirits, shirts, and hats.

We want you to feel like you have investment in that and as the weird mystery builds for you to sort of fall into this paranoia hole the same way that Henry does where you're like, what is happening?

Due to this, I was able to make my own assumptions regarding what happens when the game ends. Instead of making a quote unquote canonical, canonical ending, you have allowed every player to come up with their own personal conclusions based on the Henry you made. And that's what I kept talking about in our review, right? Is the fact that I feel like first off it's crazy that we all wanted to play this game. We all did. And then we could all sit down and talk about it, let alone the fact that we all came away with something different and like, you know, cause when we do all play Metal Gear or whatever, right.

An accidental detail that we, that did not happen on purpose. But when the animation, when you get up into the helicopter and Henry grabs it, he looks down at his hand. It means that we always show the wedding ring right at the end of the game. Not on purpose, but whatever. Spoiler cast deliberate. It was part of the, it was the original vision of Firewatch is you will see a man's hand and his wedding ring will be on it or that's how you pitched it. Yeah, that was it.

I think Lost's actual problem is that they liked all of their own characters too much. So they had to, instead of turning them bad, they had to invent like God-tier bad guys. And that made me really sad. I liked that other stuff, but then there was like a force of evil who was like a transdimensional deity that shut like Lost spoilers. Don't pull the plug out of the well of light. What the fuck is happening? Like I'm going to pull that plug. It felt like they did that because they just couldn't make the actual character of Locke a bad guy, but whatever.

I was like, yeah, let's just start there. I mean, I think the reason that the lookout tower is, I mean, I'm going to just talk for you, but I think the reason that a fire lookout tower in the middle of Wyoming was a compelling image is because you hiked up in the middle of Wyoming with your dad and saw them as a kid.

And that's way less cool than the than the fire lookout tower version. But you look at that and you just think someone is spending a good part of a year just sitting up in that weird room. Sure.

Well, that's actually the core conflict inside of Henry. He's like, man, I saw the trailer and I thought that it was about the Titanic showing up, but it was about a painting. That's what he finds out when he goes home. That is about a fucking painting. Who is this Vigo asshole? God, my life sucks. I thought it was about the Statue of Liberty versus the Titanic.

And then there's little pockets of hidden stuff off to the sides. And I think if I was doing this from scratch, if we were like for some bad reason, making a Firewatch too, literally, I think that the way that I would probably build the world is there whenever you're sitting out to someplace, I would try to put players on a path that would lead them to a really clear, sorry, to a really clear fork.
