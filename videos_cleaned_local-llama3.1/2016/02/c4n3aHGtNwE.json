So that's definitely one of those first signs you see where you're like maybe you're on to something and now you have to you know have the courage to just kind of keep pushing trying something else and until things stick. I remember with Capcom, they've been really good about stuff. Then you did Mega Ran 9 after that, and then after that, you did the M vs. Capcom 2 like vinyl hip-hop stuff that was awesome.

So where did Black Materia fall then?
