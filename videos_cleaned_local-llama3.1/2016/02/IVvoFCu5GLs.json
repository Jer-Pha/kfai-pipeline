Um, no, I don't, I think they might be doing a horror game, but I don't think it would involve anyone that was involved in the old game because I just I don't think that Sony would be that stupid. Because I do think that it exposes them to an incredible amount of like bleed over from a previous project, that is a previous company with a previous publisher or a previous engine with previous knowledge of what was going on and it doesn't seem like a smart move.

Why can't there be multiple things that he's working on? That's not what I think is going to happen.

No Tim, you can't just say a Pok\u00e9mon MMO; feel free to discuss that, but that's too easy. I agree it is too easy.
