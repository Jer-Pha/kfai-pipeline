And it would mean the world to me if you went and voted for me - of course! Every time we win one of these things, it's a win for Kinda Funny, and it's a win for you because we get to go there and be like, \"Hey, people have never heard of us!\" Guess what? People like us! And everybody goes, \"Who are you?\" And they go, \"Maybe I want to be best friends with them.\" Or they're jerks, and they say, \"We'll stay away from everybody.\" So if you go to KindaFunny.com/SXSW, vote for Greg Miller for most entertaining online personality. I would take it as a personal favor that I will never ever be able to repay you for. Topic two of the day: video game music. What are your favorite video game soundtracks? This is open to everybody, but I have a feeling you're going to have some good answers here.

You know what I mean? It isn't like when I was playing Super Mario World before The Pinkerton came out. Cuz once The Pinkerton came out, I listened to that on repeat while playing Super Mario World, but before that, you know what I mean? When you knew every beat of that song and it was so much part of the game right? See, have a totally different experience with that. Where I still notice the music in games like current games, like Final Fantasy - they're still just as standout to me, and the moments are still like I identify them when I think about a certain sequence in a game, I hear the music in my head. Uncharted definitely the same way, well, the \"Uncharted\" theme or whatever, and the \"Did REO of Uncharted\" but yeah, just like all",

But it's because like control is taken away and it's like I'm watching a movie cinematic thing. I mean I think even MGS5 is a good example, because Metal Gear to me the music always has been kind of a big a big deal, and like it is tied to sequences and stuff. And MGS Solid 5 because it's more open, it has less of those moments but when it does happen, and every time it's like yeah... and um... and that that like when that Peace Walker theme kind of comes back, and like those moments are always great, you know.

Like yeah, that's the interesting thing to me is that... and that's why I love talking to you because the Mega Man music in especially two, three, and then parts of four, five, six, nine - I think really killed it in 10 was pretty good too, but that's so much better than everything else around it.

So tracks that I really love were the ones that I went to first was the opposite because if you've ever been to a video game music festival or heard any video game music covers everyone does \"Wily\" (corrected from \"Wy\"), everyone it's that Ice Cap Zone from Sonic 3 yeah pretty much uh or um Sonic 2 uh Chemical Plant which I love and it's like everyone does it so you can't go anywhere without hearing it and when I went to my first MAGFest, or PAX, everyone on the you know on the schedule played the same song and I'm like \"for\"",

I feel about Brightman's Demon from Mega Man 4 - like, there's a weird emotion in this song. I'm like, \"This is kind of weird.\" I don't know if they even meant it like this. What's cool is something that I think a couple of their franchises specifically old ones do where there there is you immediately can identify that it's Mega Man; you know, and even when they do kind of shift the gears and make it more emotional or slower or whatever, it still feels like Mega Man. And it's weird because it's not like they're using instruments - you know? It's just using the chipset stuff. But Mega Man has that; Sonic has it too.

Um, and just more powerful hardware like the way in Final Fantasy IV when the Red Wings are flying in the beginning or whatever and it's like it's iconic like and like you don't need it to sound any better than it sounded there so like when they remix them and they play them orchestrally and they do them live and I'm like that's great but like actually the original version is actually probably better than this. You know, I don't agree.

No, it was a glancing thing. Yeah, exactly. But like they were always there; there were always there. Was always you know, I've been listening to hip-hop for a really long time too, and like I always felt like the the communities were somewhat kind of intertwined in some way. And but um, you know one of my favorite rappers now is the last few years is Curren$y, and I found him because he rapped about Mega Man 3 in one of his songs, and someone told me about that, like...and just it wasn't like a joke; like like it was a joke but it was like straight up like just part of his rap about how he was stealing someone's girlfriend and bringing her to",
