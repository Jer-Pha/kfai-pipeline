And it would mean the world to me if you went and voted for me - of course. Every time we win one of these things, it's a win for Kinda Funny, and it's a win for you because we get to go there and be like, 'Hey, people have never heard of us.' Guess what? People like us! And everybody goes, 'Who are you?' And they go, 'Maybe I want to be best friends with them,' or they're jerks and they say, 'We'll stay away from everybody.' So if you go to KindaFunny.com/SXSW, vote for Greg Miller for most entertaining online personality. I would take it as a personal favor that I will never ever be able to repay you for. Topic three: Final Fantasy XV. Now, I've been saying for years, 'I can't wait for this game.' I'm super stoked. I've been a big fan of the series before we even get into it. Let's talk about this for the first time on Gamescast - me and Greg are hosting Final Fantasy Uncovered: Final Fantasy XV Uncovered in March.\"",

But like when it was very every time this was getting announced, when it was going to finally be announced on Sunday the last or whatever Saturday at 9:00 p.m. Uh, I had Reddit and Gaff open, and I was ready because I knew as soon as we got announced, the first comments would be... I thought they'd be a lot meaner. Everybody was super nice, and there were a lot of people saying \"I love Kinda Funny,\" Tim makes sense, why is Greg there? And the first comment I saw on Reddit said that I tackled it; it was like, \"Hey, that's exactly what I asked Square Enix when they came to us and asked us to host.\" And they had a good response, which was, \"I want because you remember I originally tried to...
