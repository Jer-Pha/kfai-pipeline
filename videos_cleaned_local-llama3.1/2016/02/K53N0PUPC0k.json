That's a good call. I don't have them in particular order, so yeah, are we in ordering them? Should we order them? No, let's just throw them out there because I have a feeling it's going to be a lot of overlap. And if there is overlap, Colin had the idea that we should come up with more than five, so we can have 10, so there's no overlap. Okay, I got a guy. We'll be fine. Uh, well, the first one for me is The Division. I've been waiting for that game for a long time. It looks great. A lot of people at work are anxious to play; they're involved in the beta. Ugh, I just... I love the atmosphere. It's basically like The Last of Us in a giant multiplayer setting. So I think for me, that that is the most intriguing multiplayer game outside of Rocket League that I've seen in a while. I just like because there's there's that undertone of of story going on.",

But it's um, I don't know, there's a certain point again, I'm old, but there's a point in my life where I just expected a lot of narrative on all my single-players, that's faded away though, you know what I mean? That's an old-school thing, yeah. My number one was The Division as well, and I think it's stupid that we can't do it, so I'm just going to talk with Jeremy during his stream - you can talk, you can do that.

So I think that's always going to be one of the things that I go into all horror games just knowing like well they're probably going to have some moment in the game where I'm ruined by the fact that whatever direction they went isn't the way that I would go, but uh I I I just love the fact that I can still be caught up in a particular moment and that that moment, what the memory of that moment overshadows everything like the first time in the first at Last of Us.",

That one little moment still is memorable to me even though there's much bigger game beyond that just simply because of that one way that it hooked me. And so I think that's the way I approach War Games - what are the moments that really kept me coming back? Like the dog through the window, Resident Evil, and uh the first Silent Hill when you're walking down that alley and the camera changes just so uncomfortably and you're like \"what the hell's going on\" right before the babies start running out.

I mean, first of all, Cuphead's art is awesome. What a great novel idea for a game, and I think that even though games weren't around in the 30s, which is, you know, in the 20s when this is really kind of based or like this art style's based, it does seem congruent with a hard game. I don't think Cuphead can be anything but brutally hard, that's why I like it. I like games that are hard; I like boss fights, you know? I remember being a kid and playing some platformers like where the game would bring you to tears, it was so hard, like, and like that kind of stuff, like where I'm like, because it's satisfying.

But now, with only an hour of playtime, I want to sit down and feel like I've gone through an entire chapter of something or two levels of something. And uh, so to me, time is the great enemy of a difficult game. That's why, when it first came out, I loved something like Alien Hominid. Now, when I sit down and my daughters show interest in wanting to play Alien Hominid because I see it in my library, I'm like, \"I don't want to play this right now because we're not going to get very far.\" And uh, I just feel like the time is so valuable now that hard is in the way.

No, I respect that and not every game has to be like that, you know, you're not playing Gone Home for any difficulty, you're playing for experience so I think there's something different than that and I like games that have scaling difficulty so that you don't have to worry about those kinds of things, I always ramp up my Call of Duty campaigns to Veteran because I think it's the most interesting that way but to your point this year I",

I don't think we've seen the last of Killzone, but I think that we um are going to see something super interesting from them.
