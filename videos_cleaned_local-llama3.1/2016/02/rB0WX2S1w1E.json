Did you wander into the wrong show? Are you sure you're supposed to be on this one? I got an email saying you gotta be here at one o'clock and I was late. Over here at the Pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. It's good to be here with you, Greg. And then over here, ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Sean and Jake from Campo Santo. Hi. Hey. Hey, Jake. Hey. You guys made Firewatch. We did. Just you two. No. Just you two. No. We are 20% of the people who did that. Yeah, that's about right. We're not really so good at math. We're less than 20% of Firewatch. Okay. Yeah. But you did the heavy lifting. We did less than 20% of the heavy lifting. Tim Gettys has gone to Philadelphia to eat cheesesteaks and see his girlfriend.

Because you played Firewatch. I did. We all played Firewatch. Even Greg Miller played Firewatch. Oh, my stomach just went flop, flop, flop. It's weird meeting people who have played Firewatch because that wasn't true for like ever. Yeah. True. And now it's been true for a minute and it's very peculiar. It's very strange.

How weird is it right now? Because we're recording. This will post on Friday for patrons. Everybody else, you know, cheapskates. How weird is it? It's Wednesday. Your game came out Monday on PC. Moderately weird. Tuesday on PS4. It came out Tuesday, Tuesday. Oh, see, I don't know how Steam works. Yeah, Steam works. You just push the button whenever you want. It's a green button. And you did it all on the same day. And it goes. And you go, huh. So it's been 24 hours of people playing the game. Yes. Yeah. What's that like? Really crazy. Yeah? Yeah. Really cool.

And then all of a sudden, there's tens and tens and tens of thousands, six figures of people playing it. The noise sort of hits everyone equally. So you can kind of like, it's, oh, there's 200 people. So we're all kind of like, get it. Oh, when you're on a big team? Yeah. Or at a big studio.

That said, there's a lot less weird bureaucracies slash sort of just ambiguity about, can we patch? Can we fix a thing? People have found something. And just being able to put it out. Especially on Steam, it's incredible. Although, I've never been as close to a Steam release as this, because I'm used to working at Telltale where I used to work. And I've found a really amusing thing, which is when your game is live on Steam and you want to put an update up to it, it has a dry run test where you have to type the word Steamworks in and press enter before you can submit the form.

It doesn't feel like... There's no relief moment, because you're just, the game's alive and people are playing it and you're reacting to that. So I don't know when we're going to go to the office and it's just going to feel like a normal day again. Sure. It's crazy. It's been so well received. What do you know so far about numbers? It's been, what, 28 hours, I guess, since it's been released? Yeah. We don't really talk about numbers too much publicly, but the game paid for itself already, which is pretty cool. Not too shabby.

How do you get numbers on that? You just go look at all the different seeds and torrent sites. You just go look. Go try to pirate your own game and you go like, oh. You assume that those people were just never going to play it, but it's still a staggering number. It's a staggering double digit percentage of all. There's a lot of people who are never going to buy your game but will still beat it. Yeah. Oh, well. I mean, what do you know? It is what it is.

I want to dial it back and talk a little bit about where Firewatch comes from, but then also Campo Santo because I remember last time you came through, the first time I ever met you, not last time, I guess, but the first time I ever met you, you came into IGN, Big Dick swinging around. Oh, just. Just thunderous. Here's Walking Dead season one. I'm going to get interviewed by Greg Miller. It's during Judgment Day when we had all these. I remember that. Yeah, that was fun.

Yeah. I mean, mostly. Yeah. I mean, how do you always answer this question? It's been a while since I talked about this, actually, because we've just been heads down on Firewatch. But I mean, I was at Telltale for about eight years and I was there not from the beginning, but I was there starting with the second Bone game, which was like the third thing they put out.

Like, you know, I started off Telltale was my first job in the games industry and I started off like hired as a forum mod and community moderator. And I worked up over about eight years to being a creative director, which was an incredible. That's the path. That's what you want to do. That is the most that is the most insane trajectory in the entire world. And everyone thinks that they want. I don't know how that happened, but I mean. Every single thing that I did there was learning something completely new, and then I got when Walking Dead season one ended, it was like the next logical step was Walking Dead season two.

So we know that we know that drive. You know, that was our thing. I think it's that we've been at IGN so long and gotten to this point where it was like, well, what's next? What's the next step for us? And when you look outside, that's what it was. It was this room right here. This room, this table. Yeah. We're like, let's take a giant step backward into my bedroom. Spare bedroom. I love it. Yeah, that seems all about right. Yeah.

And it's just life at every like company that is more than you wait until the day that you find yourself being like the executive manager of Kinda Funny and you're not actually on any of the shows anymore. Yeah, that'll never happen. His ego will never allow that to happen. A camera? Yeah, I will ruin everybody else's show. No, but that's but that's something that's very, really interesting.

And like how players would respond to it. We knew what we thought about it, but that doesn't really get you anywhere. I at least was forced to sort of think about what if this doesn't work out? Like what's next? Sure. You know, so I think like, OK, like where would I go work? Like where like where do I? Who do I call and say, hey, can I interview? Like me now. And that was really hard because it's like Sean was saying, if we want to do something, we do it. And we live with the good and the bad. And like there's no.

Deport them back to Canada. That would be such a bummer. Right. The Island where you from? What? I'm not Canadian. I'm natural born. Are you? Yeah. So I can relate. I can relate to what you guys are saying in the sense that, you know, something you said resonated with me, which is like, you can never, you know, easily since anyway, you can never really go back.

It did really help that we, me, Sean and our friend Chris, Chris Roberts, who's also on Idle Thumbs, that like just in the middle of The Walking Dead season one, we did the Idle Thumbs, we did a Kickstarter for Idle Thumbs and we were able to raise enough money to rent a permanent recording studio, turn that into an actual business. And like a tiny weird one. But you know, like that, that, that was enough to sort of make us go, oh, actually I think we could do a way more outrageous version of that and actually try to start our own company to make video games.

There was never one moment where we're like, this is happening. But was there a defining moment where you were like, fuck, like, okay, we're all going to do this. Like this is actually going to happen. Yeah, I think a little bit.

And I remember having to go to the first meeting for it and going like, I don't feel like I should go to this meeting because like my heart is like, I've already, I'm already out.

And like, we gave him all sorts of bad ideas, but people had the knowledge already that we, that we were planning on leaving. So we just felt like it would, it would have been really dishonest, I guess, of us to be there as creative, creative representatives of Telltale when our heart was already in another place.

I thought it'd be like the game shifts when we go, Oh, okay, next is right. Post-launch support and PR and stuff. But instead it was just like as it got closer and closer, I realized that it was not like a little series of steps, but there was actually just like a huge wall of everything was stacked up at the exact same time. And with a team our size, you know, it is like, okay, the game is, is, is either almost out or it's in, it's in period or it's launched and it's like press support patches, community management, checking on what everyone's doing.

So we were like when we knew that was going to happen, we're like, Oh, let's do preorder it before the sale because like we don't want to, we're worried about that sale. And not that it mattered ultimately, but we were worried. So that just meant like the moment, but that just meant like the moment the game went live, we just had like tens of thousands of customers, like so many customers.

I was like, Oh wait, okay, this has got a different sense of pacing to this. This is not about action. This is more cerebral.

Delilah Delilah when it was just when the story existed as like plot beats as like index cards up on a board Delilah being in the tower came in and out of the story in and out as we were figuring out what the heck it means but as Sean said the more she became a character as we started writing and as sort of we figured out what was her past life like what is her relationship with Henry why the hell is she actually out in this job what is her relationship with like the good winds and how does that affect her and it just like it the idea that she would",

He's had such a life has sucked for the past 10 years, and he just wants to feel better. He took the job to feel better; he just wants to feel better.

And I shut it down; I was like, \"That is too much. Richard Sturgeon, okay fine.\" So he would write, he would draw one and come up with a name for it, and then I would sit down and go, \"Well, what's the story of this novel?\" And then I had to basically write this author, like Richard Sturgeon's career arc where he over those 10 crime books over 10 crime books; he likes at the top of his game, and then he sort of got like the Tom; he's got like the clear and present danger one that like ends up being a movie, and then he just sort of like finally wraps up his life's work and stops.",

No, but I think a Firewatch was a movie; we probably have a little bit less of it in there.

And then plus you can read into how emotionally distraught Henry is that he's blowing off Ghostbusters II releasing in the summer of '89. Well, that's actually the core like conflict inside of Henry where he's like man I saw the trailer and I thought that it was about the Titanic showing up but it was about a painting that's what he finds out when he goes home that is about a fucking painting sucks I thought it was about the Statue of Liberty versus the Titanic that's what I thought as",
