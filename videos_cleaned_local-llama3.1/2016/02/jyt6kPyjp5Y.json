And you see a lot of Japanese developers still doing this because the PS3 still thrives there; so it's the same thing with Persona 5 like that's going to be a PS3 game that was clearly just put on PS4, Tales of Zestiria was another game that was just released on PS4 just for the West, it didn't even come out in Japan on the PS4.
