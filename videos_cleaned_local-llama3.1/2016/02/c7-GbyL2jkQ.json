This is sparked by an article by Jason Parr over at Kotaku Electronic Arts is essentially skipping E3 this year, pulling out of the trade show in favor of their own events in Los Angeles and London that will be open to the public rather than hosting an E3 press conference and putting up a big flashy booth for trade show attendees. The publisher will hold an event called EA Play that will run from June 12th to June 14th at Club Nokia in Los Angeles, which is like a block away from E3, yeah it's right across the street there. And they also plan to hold a one-day event on June 12th at the Mermaid Event Center in London, which sounds awesome. I don't know where that is, it's underwater anyway. Anyone who wants to attend either event can sign up for more information on the website EA still plans to hold a press conference, they say, and it's likely we'll see news and trailers for much-hyped games like Mass Effect: Andromeda and The Visit.",

But instead of their traditional spot on Monday afternoon, they're going to hold the press conference on Sunday, EA Play blah blah blah, they say a whole bunch of other stuff. Um, what do you guys think about this? Fascinating, you know what I mean, like we talk about all the time over in Publisher Hall when you walk in, it's EA, and it takes up all this space. And there's usually a break in the middle of it because it's that big, there's so much happening there, so that's going to be a huge hole to fill over there. And then you start wondering, it's like well, and I'm the question is, well can they fill it? Of course, they can, but like are they going to stretch themselves thin, who all do they let in, how do they do that, you know what I mean, and what does",

No, yeah, yeah. So I think like I think this says a great deal about the direction that the industry is going in as much as it says about EA's own calculations and EA's own roster of games. Like I think there's much to be read into this. Because I did not expect it; you didn't, EA. In fact, I was telling Greg, \"This is like the last company I would expect to let go of E3.\" So if they're willing to do it, what is Ubisoft going to do and like next year in Activision and all these companies? Do they need to be there anymore? And like once everyone starts pulling out, does E3 even exist anymore?

But I don't think those are mutually exclusive like we've seen it with Sony, how many goddamn press conferences did they have last year, like with PSX and um, they backed out of Gamescom, it's things have changed the press conference game has totally changed there's multiple conferences all the time and how do you cover them all where do you put your stuff convention season is from January to December now.

Like how many people can get out in front of the giant Behemoth that is these conferences from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo Direct right to get out and have their message be heard and not be drowned out and not have it be that oh man, this isn't funny right now.
