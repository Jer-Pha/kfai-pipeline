I don't think I would even count comics in that either. Comics would be... I don't know what that would be. Uh, I was saying more like reading books, reading magazines, like read... like reading we all read every day. I'm reading **** tape on my so then yeah the internet totally counts. You're telling me you're reading an article on the internet and it's not as valuable as an article in a magazine. Okay, I mean if that's the way you want to quantify it. Yeah, okay, and then then I'm going to go TV for your Arrows, your Flash, your House of Cards, and then I'm going to put movies in there.

Like, would you be comfortable with that choice? That the choices you made. And for me, if I had reading and music and nothing and none of these other things, I'd be totally comfortable with that. I mean, I wouldn't want to do that, but if that was the choice I had to make, I wouldn't want to reorder it in any way. Me too, with that - games and reading. I got reading music, I put reading as number one not because I read a lot, but you love R books because every single time I read, I'm like **** I really like this, I should do this more often.

Like, you can't do it anymore carefully with what you want, like what you'd want. Not that that would happen, but like, what would you want that list to look like in that reality? I would be totally honest if someone said... and this is just an idea I flirt with. I'm just in the age bracket where like, the idea of cutting the cable is still painful to me, but I could do without TV. I would probably be 20% happier if I just stopped watching TV altogether.
