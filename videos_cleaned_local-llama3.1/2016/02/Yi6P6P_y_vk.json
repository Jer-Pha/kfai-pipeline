So Sean, did you like Deadpool? I really, really liked Deadpool; I thought it was very enjoyable and I was highly entertained basically the entire time. Gotcha! I like Deadpool a lot and recommend you see it - yes, if you're into superhero movies, I think I got what I expected going in; it was a fun, goofball movie, disposable in a sense, you know?

Or even a DC enthusiast, you know? Like I know the big ones, I read the big comic books and stuff like that on the DC side and on the Marvel side. But I never really grew up reading comic books, so I don't really know them as intricately as other people. That said, the character is really funny on screen, he's charming - you enjoy what he's saying, he really does at least to me personify the Merc with a Mouth. He's always got snappy comebacks, sarcastic remarks that make you laugh and kind of like realize how witty he is. It's super good. Yeah, see I think that the line between funny and too far is thin because they could have gone way too far and it would have been bad.",

I think I'm right in saying that early on he's portrayed as more of an anti-hero, right yeah oh yeah well he's definitely an anti-hero the entire time at least in the comic books, but at least in this movie he is that the entire time, that's what I kind of liked about it was that he does have redeeming qualities, he's not a tragic character but everyone around him is as psychotic as he is which allows the world to exist right and so like if he did all these things and there was a normal world of X-Men where people would be like \"what are you doing?

But then I was expecting more of those and more characters, like pirate Deadpool, and this, that, and the other thing, and the fact that they don't exist isn't bad, but then it's just weird that like so is it clear to the audience that he's not me, that knows a little bit about Deadpool, that he's just crazy and he does this and he knows this or is it weird for them? And then he's still chasing the girl. Like, you're saying you wanted there to be an actual reason or more setup for why he breaks the fourth wall? I'm just saying yeah, a little bit to that, or just one or the other. I feel like it's weird to still if is he crazy and if he's crazy, I think it's weird that he's still going after the girl.
