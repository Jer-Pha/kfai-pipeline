Steve says, \"I talk to girls and I'm friends with girls but I'm not the type to make the first move.\" Is it really that important or should I wait until the girl makes the first move? Is there any benefit to having the girl make the first move? All right, okay. Before we... yeah, we have to clarify: what do you mean by \"the first move\"? Is that like, \"Hey, do you want to go on a date with me,\" or is it more like, \"What's up?\" The difference think it's I think it's the latter, I think it's yeah, I mean it's kind of hard to know when it's right to make the first move. I feel like it has to be a thing that just happens. Yeah, you know? You can't force it; you can't be like, \"This is the first move.\" Like, you can't be thinking, \"I'm going to make the first move.\" It just... you just have to do it. Like, you can't be thinking about it; the more you think about it, the more awkward it's going to be. Yeah, I mean.",

Yeah, I mean here's the thing if you're in a situation you're sitting on the couch right, you're Netflixing, you're chilling, you're happening and if you're like I I wanted to I'm bored of the Netflix I want to get to the chill and you're like how do I how do I make that happen. The thing is yeah just do it because if you're thinking about it you're going to eventually make some move so why not just do it, there's no waiting for the right time cuz there is no right time what's going to affect everything is how she responds to and that's either going to be a yes or a no. Time has nothing to do with it, you'll you'll be able to tell you know as you're walking a girl or as you're standing at a front door whether or not she wants to make that move but don't be afraid of it try it if you get rejected you get rejected",

I feel like if I walked in on Barry Manilow and like a fireplace in glass of wine, I'd be like \"Oh cool.\" Like I would call it out and I would make fun of it. I feel like that is a time and place date where it's like that's not a first move, that's a fourth or fifth move where you're trying to be funny if you're trying to be serious with that, like, \"Oh, that's not a good look.\" My wife would walk in and then just keep going to the bedroom. The door would be open. Uh, I think that you know there are telltale signs though. Physical contact is always good. You want to get a little of the elbows going. Yeah, if she's doing the thing where every time you say something that you know isn't funny but she laughs a little bit and gives you a little upper arm squeeze, that's good. If she's doing the eye contact a little bit too long, that makes you feel incredibly",

Um, but at the end of the day, you just got to read the room and go for it or read the room and more importantly don't go for it, cuz there's nothing worse than unwanted advances, ask Kevin, yeah, oh my God, it's so true, and Kevin, yeah, we give him so much crap. Um, what's really interesting about this is he's saying he has a lot of friends that are girls, and like, that's the thing if they're if you have friends that are girls, they're friends leave it there, yeah, leave it there.
