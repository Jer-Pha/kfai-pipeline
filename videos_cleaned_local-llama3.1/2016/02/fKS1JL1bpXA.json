Additionally, an apparent survey from GfK, a client of Nintendo, has surfaced online by way of Twitter user Liam Robertson providing new details about Nintendo NX. And in addition to mentioning connectivity between a handheld and console unit, the survey also highlights an achievement-based system, 4K 60fps video streaming, and \"gameplay graphics that run in 900p at 60 FPS\" according to the rest of the survey provided by Twitter user Emily Rogers.

The remainder of the survey compares various price options, hard drive configurations, and more across an array of different game platforms including Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PS4, and other stuff. And other stuff, yeah, there's also rumors uh people are talking about um there being an event before E3 that kind of announces the NX and then E3 is the real like you know let's look at the games, and then uh there's also interviews where people were talking about Metroid Prime and they're like \"Is Metroid Prime going to come\"",

I I think at the very least what it probably is is something like what Rocket League does which is talks to PC and PS4 at the same time and I'm wondering if like they just have all this information saying like we're we're not going to close the console off to communicating with other consoles but we still have to play the NX itself to play NX games or whatever because um I just don't see that they're going to because if what if they're saying is true then it's basically them just going third party and what the hell is",

There's no way that that's just the standard that everything is going to be 60 frames per second and 900p. You look at Wii U, and so many games are 900p now or 1080p, some are 60, some are 30, whatever. So it's like it's weird that they even call that out, especially when they call out video at 4K 60fps video streaming. Like, not everything's going to be that. Yeah, it just seems like that might be the standard.

A lot of those games sold one, two, three, four million copies a game. Like Mario Kart seems to have like a one-to-two attach rate, which is huge, but predictably, it didn't really move units. Splatoon didn't really move units; Smash didn't really move units. It's the Nintendo fans are buying the Nintendo console, and there are fewer and fewer of them as you go along.

Not only do you need to give the good people mailboxes, you also need to break the windows of the bad people, and doing all that - that was the moment when we took the game that they gave us and made our own, made our own game from it. I think that's the moment that I was like, \"This is my life,\" and I love it a lot. Question two comes from Arctic Sloth, we know him, and other beautiful bastards at the table: How video games affected your real-world problem-solving skills? I don't know; I'm not sure, to be honest. I mean, game logic is totally different than real-world logic, mostly. Mhm. In my experience, um, I mean, game logic is its own thing. Yeah. But so, I you saying that sparks something with me is like I'm a scheming bastard; I'm always trying to like game the system, and I think video games are about gaming the system. You know, it's like when you're grinding an RPG, you want to find when you notice that there's...",

I don't think you have to worry about Dark Souls people like... well, I was going to pick a rush like but Dark Souls is at you know what I mean? Sure, don't be wrong there's some of you out there who just... but I think the fact that you're tying it with a movie you're trying to get new people into it right, new younger people. Afraid of Dark Souls? I don't think so. There's enough of a thing there and it's also the same thing like this - the super hardcore PlayStation fan is going to pick up both Ratchet and Uncharted and be ready for that. MH yeah, I don't think... I don't know that it matters.

And so many people are like, \"I don't even watch your let's play,\" I don't really know what's going on, but like I see that you're good at it and if you're good at it that means that you put thought into it 'cause you don't really play too many games.
