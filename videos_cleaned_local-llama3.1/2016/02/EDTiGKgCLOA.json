And so we have to I think look at that and assume that Obsidian ended up taking maybe twice as long as they probably should have, sure.

So the basic idea of it - I recommend it - is that there are five episodes, each episode's like two hours long, an hour and a half long. Um, but your character carries over from episode to episode. So, one takes place in his high school, one takes place in the Town Square. It sounds awesome whenever you talk about it. And the idea is, uh, you fight all these enemies or whatever in turn-based fights. But you have like a Trapper Keeper, like a binder, and on the binder are like stickers. And you have five stickers active at one time, um, and then a bunch of stickers that you can like mix in and out. They're like scratch-and-sniff stickers, I guess, which were a big deal - I don't know if they even make those anymore. But they were something some kids used to love.",

My question is this: do you think more studios that do digital-only games should start investing in physical editions, like Life is Strange? A physical edition of Super Meat Boy is coming, and I would just love to have more titles like Transistor, Hotline Miami, or Bastion on my shelf. And if they come with extra content, even better.
