The song would have been done by now, and you would have totally known everything. We got some weird tangent on the show, but I don't even understand the source of this. There was the Tree of Trust; that's where this came from. Yeah, no, what it was... no, what it was. That gets even better because we... yeah, it was from the Tree of Trust, and then we said that Kevin isn't in the tree, and I said, \"Yeah, he's so far out the side of the gates he can't see it,\" which made me think of a little Kevin in rags like Zacchaeus unable to see the very Syamore tree.
