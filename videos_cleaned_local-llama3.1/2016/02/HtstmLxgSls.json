And it would mean the world to me if you went and voted for me. Of course, every time we win one of these things, it's a win for Kinda Funny, and it's a win for you because we get to go there and be like, 'Hey, people have never heard of us.' Guess what? People like us! And everybody goes, 'Who are you?' And they go, 'Maybe I want to be best friends with them,' or they're jerks, and they say, 'We'll stay away from everybody.' So if you go to KindaFunny.com/SXSW, invoke Greg Miller for most entertaining online personality. I would take it as a personal favor that I will never ever be able to repay you for. Final topic of the day, as always, brought to you by the Kinda Funny forums. Go to KindaFunny.com/GamescastTopic to leave your topic for us to read in the show, just like Boiled Frog did. He says, 'We all love video games. We always talk about our favorite games why we should play this.'\"",

We always talk about our favorite games, why we should play this game or that game, and why we're excited about this game's release, whatever.\" My question is, what do you hate about video games? Is it multiplayer-only games, games without multiplayer, open-world Games, linear Games, bad Graphics, great graphics, bad gameplay, great gameplay I hate great gameplay sloppy. I want to clip through the floor. Uh, great story but lore is too deep episodic Gam all like there's a couple good things there though. I think the great story but the lore being too deep is a is a daunting thing that I wouldn't necessarily think about. But getting into a game like for someone that hasn't played a Final Fantasy and looking at Final Fantasy 15 and not knowing like what you need to know, and not that could be pretty intimidating. I mean, that's why you see games like The Witcher when it came out.",

That trying to run through... I installed a whole bunch of stuff on my PS4 recently, was playing one of them recently, they had a really bad tutorial section where it was one of those things where it's like if you would just let me go and play the game, I'd figure it all out on my own, but it was like one of those like hold up, hold up, hold up now you're going to be times you have to hold R1 and hit... they like what the **** just let me go, you know what I mean? I'll be fine, but like it was like making you go every time and try it and then go to the next part and try it and then go to the next yeah, the games that have tutorials that you don't even know you're playing the tutorial.",

Like, is it is like the game good? Is the game fun? You know I still say River Raid is one of my favorite games of all time on Atari 2600. That game is like one of the most basic things, everything but it's fun. Who cares what it looks like? It's the more I could make that **** game probably now if you just gave me like a little bit of a tutorial on how to code and stuff like that. It's not complicated; it's just fun. There's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't mean that like things don't have to look like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to be fun. In fact, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is fun, but it's also in my mind way too dense and way too big. You know? Like, and so like I think that we we look at things as technical specs, scope, gameplay length all these kinds of things, and I'm like no, no, no. This doesn't make a game.",

I hate unskippable cut scenes. Why would you want to skip the cut scenes because if it's before a boss fight and I freaking die three times, one... what I drives me crazy with unskippable cut scenes is when it crashes or something happens or there's no save point on the other side and you come back and you have to sit through. I'm saying like when you lose the boss fight you have to keep going Kingdom Hearts, like freaking Roxas' third fight with him, you had to freaking die and it was so hard and then I kept dying, it's like a five-minute cut scene before and it's like",

It's like a five-minute cutscene before, and it's like that's so annoying. Another thing about cutscenes is I hate when games don't have a subtitle option. I like having subtitles because I like knowing exactly what people are saying, and um, it's it's so stupid to me when it's just not an option. Yeah, also games that don't let you button map or remap buttons are annoying. Not that I remap buttons often, but there are times when you want to, and like I just don't understand this orthodoxy towards like this is the way you play it. It's like well why can't I play it the way I want to play it? It's a similar mantra to like being able to skip cutscenes. It's like well why would you want to skip them? It's like none of your business, I'm playing the game, you know what I mean? So like it's my game now, and unskippable is a huge thing, but um, long loading times",

They've been doing so great so far coming out today, very excited to play with some Bayonetta but uh yeah it's I I think that that's uh it has to happen.
