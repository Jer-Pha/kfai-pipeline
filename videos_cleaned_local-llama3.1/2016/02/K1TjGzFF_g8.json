Additionally, an apparent survey from GfK, a client of Nintendo, has surfaced online by way of Twitter user Liam Robertson providing new details about Nintendo NX. And in addition to mentioning connectivity between a handheld and console unit, the survey also highlights an achievement-based system, 4K 60fps video streaming, and \"gameplay graphics that run in 900p at 60 FPS\" according to the rest of the survey provided by Twitter user Emily Rogers. Nintendo's console may have a free online service as well as a subscription option that includes more features for a yearly slim monthly fee. Backwards compatibility is also mentioned as the survey gauges interest in the ability to rent or purchase old games digitally, as well as support for previously owned digital and physical media oh",

The remainder of the survey compares various price options, hard drive configurations, and more across an array of different game platforms including Nintendo NX, Xbox One, PS4, and other stuff. And other stuff, yeah, there's also rumors uh people are talking about um there being an event before E3 that kind of announces the system and like blows that out, and then E3 is the real like you know let's look at the games. And then there's also interviews where people were talking about Metroid Prime and they're like \"is Metroid Prime going to come to Wii U?\"",

I, I think at the very least what it probably is is something like what Rocket League does which is talks to PC and PS4 at the same time and I'm wondering if like they just have all this information saying like we're we're not going to close the console off to communicating with other consoles but we still have to play the NX itself to play NX games or whatever because um I just don't see that they're going to because if what if they're saying is true then it's basically them just going third party and what the hell is",

So what that's the thing when it says with new games added to the catalog 6 to 18 months after their release implies that it is new games. Like I don't think that means new old games because because that says 150 titles that are changed regularly, with new games added to the catalog 6 to 18 months after but that's the I mean I read that I get regular meaning weekly monthly it be it's changed out and then the new games are added way later you know yeah I I I mean this is this is it's exciting because if it is what it sounds it could be then this is Nintendo, this is a truly radically different Nintendo but you have to but if it is what it seems like it's going to be then why are they making hardware at all so",

But the thing to keep in mind is if this being a survey that's such a random number 900p at 60 FPS - there's no way that that's just the standard that everything is going to be 60 frames per second and 900p. You look at Wii U, and so many games are 900p now or 1080p, some are 60, some are 30, whatever. So it's like it's weird that they even call that out, especially when they call out video at 4K 60fps video streaming - like that just means not everything's going to be that. Yeah, it just seems like that might be the standard. I mean, that was the huge problem with Xbox One, which is that it seemed like it was having a hard time running games at 60 frames at 1080p, so um you have to scale back the resolution to",

That story leaked and I was the one who wanted to talk to some people and figure out that it was real. So we had like some information, in other words, if this thing's coming out then everyone has it, you know, and no one's saying anything about it. It's easy to get out of Ubisoft, like the Assassin's Creed game that's coming out two years from now, but no one's talking about this hardware that they have. I just believe that people abide by their NDAs, I mean obviously everyone does, I mean people like PS Sports and Xbox One's as well, but people did leak a lot of information about that kind of stuff. And so I just wonder how proliferated the console is and if it's really going to be ready to go in the fall. I would rather",

Is Ubisoft really making a thing for the NX to get their game on no, like you know what I mean? This would be Nintendo's device to play Nintendo games or to play Nintendo games on their app at which point the handheld console is locked behind closed doors in Tokyo and nobody is going to talk about it or do anything until it comes out because you don't need to get in the hands of developers if NX is a console or a hybrid of some sort, which it probably is, and there's no meaningful new game functionality on the other consoles and it's for Nintendo games only.

So, they can't do that \u2013 they just can't create a system to play Just Nintendo games. They just did that, and it didn't sell. Nothing on that console resonated with a large group of people. A lot of those games sold one, two, three, four million copies; a game like Mario Kart seems to have a one-to-two attach rate, which is huge. But predictably, it didn't really move units. Splatoon didn't really move units; Smash didn't really move units. It's the Nintendo fans are buying the Nintendo console, and there are fewer and fewer of them as you go along.
