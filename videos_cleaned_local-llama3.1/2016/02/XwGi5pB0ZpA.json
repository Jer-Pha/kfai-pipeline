So this place is amazing - you're getting into a town that was a military town; we had a hanging because Abraham Lincoln gave his very first order of execution here. The hanging was here, yes, on the location, not on this table, no. Okay, making sure... so when you do these ghost hunts, do we usually find friendly ghosts like Casper or not-friendly ghosts like the other kind? It just depends; it depends on what kind of energy and what happened here. Is it true that Weiner dogs and dogs and cats and just animals in general can sense things? Yes, absolutely. What are the signs I should be looking for if he senses something? Whining and running out the door. Okay, so far, so good... so far, so good. All right, I'm the tip of the spear. What advice can you give me when I go into the Mansion if there is something there?",

We've got visual back. Okay, Colin, if you don't make it out, can I have your signed Resistance 3? Yeah, you can have both of them. Cool. I'm going to sell that. I hate that game and I hate him, and now I'm in a different room. I'm back in the artist room. There we go. And I can interact with the painting. And I place the Relic down. The painting is changing in the artist room. Do you have the Relic? I grabbed something from a painting and put it onto the painting in the game, and flamingos appeared. Just get out now. Run.
