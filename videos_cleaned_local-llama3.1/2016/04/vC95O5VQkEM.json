For more than that, I could say I liked the one doofy moment of like that last martini was this or two too many right and I like your shoes, that does feel with character there for school so I thought that worked. I really liked the relationship between him and Jeremy Irons, and I think that's again something we haven't really seen before on film. They're not it's not the you stop doing this, you're gonna die stopped it's like we passed that point ten years ago and now it's been ten years since it me just kicking the **** of everyone and this guy is no longer my Butler he is my partner in this endeavor and he is like this fifty-fifty so I liked all those moments.

So she's just gonna cause a lot more questions like... the clip that came out today - sure, what was that? That's exactly what I was telling you was gonna happen. Budget-wise, like where does the army come in? Like the dudes coming in, yeah, holiday, why they're there to apprehend Luthor, they're investigating what was going on now that Superman doomsday... they're outside of it okay, that's a Luthor at some point so how did he get arrested and put into gotcha okay mystery.

It doesn't make sense.\" Like there's no there's no motivation for any of the characters to be doing any of this stuff other than Batman doesn't like Superman. Superman knows like Batman... all right.
