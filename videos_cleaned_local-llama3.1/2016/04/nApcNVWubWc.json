So what you're going to watch here is my playthrough of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End on this I think it's chapter 10 demo or whatever and it's after watching Tim's demo of it because they wanted us to capture our second one, which we'll talk about a bit in this. So now that's solved the fact of why it's a react - cuz we're not actually playing the game as we go yeah this is Greg's footage playing; we're just talking over it and you'll see that I'm not at the end, I'll tell you I'm about to go in stealth and then it all goes to hell immediately. But the the the why are we lying in a bed is because we're in LA and so we need to do this now there's days before the embargo lifts but I go straight to Austin from here I go to do some of that Rooster Teeth goodness as they say, so with that happening I won't get back to San Francisco you're filming loving.",

Yeah, is that I set up a camera, and now I want everyone out there to know I haven't set up a camera in a long time. Yeah, so this is what you get. No, had it in the bathroom well no, you first had it out here. You're like, 'It's too dark.' Yeah, and then we're like, 'We'll do it in the bathroom' and shoot through the shower glass because this is one of those sex hotels where you'd lay here right there and you'd be in bed, you'd be like, 'Yeah, spread them,' but now no, now we shot.

It's like it gives you more than just a hallway to go down. Not that I'm against that, cuz I actually do quite enjoy that. But this game, the demo we play today reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid 5. And you kept saying that, which is interesting. You'll see it later on there. There's definitely those moments right. Uncharted has always been very much about 'we don't want to HUD' we don't want all this stuff happening right. And in this demo as we get to later, you do have the ability to mark enemies now. You pull up your gun, you train it over them, you click both sticks in and you can mark them now so you don't lose sight of them on you know what I mean. And even it does.\"",

But one is white, it's slowly filling in as they're doing it; yellow would be they know you're over there but they wait... that up, white is filling in. Yellow is they know something's happening, they're coming to investigate and then orange is like full-blown - I know that's Nathan Drake, I'm going to shoot him in the head, yeah! And it's cool too because you can run, you can hide, and it eventually lowers.

One thing that I think is interesting that I want to talk about right now is how well the Jeep handles and how differently the Jeep handles on mud, on rock, on solid ground. I'm sliding trying to get to these certain things and it's not annoying. I don't think that we be able to explain that in words; it's more of like when you play it, you're like, \"Oh man.\" Like, even watching this, I'm sure it's kind of weird looking. It reminds me a lot of the Warthog from Halo in the sense of off-roading - the cars just going and stuff. It does not feel that way; it's like when you're playing it, it's like you really do feel like you're in control of this, and when you feel like you're not in control, that means that you're on some terrain you're not supposed to be",

What do I do? And it was learning those rules of okay, that's a rock over there that has tire tracks on it, so I should be able to go up that now. Again, 10 chapters in, I'm assuming we've had these rules explained to us, and now it's starting to open up a bit. Yeah, exactly; it does get very kind of disorienting, and you don't really know like, have I been there before? 'Cause it's like, you go around the curve, and all of a sudden...like I was telling you, if you look at it as a top-down map, I'm not exactly sure what that path would look like.

You said that, and I like that more than I I've ever experienced with a vehicle in that it feels like this what we're seeing right now of of Drake kind of like doing the the climbing thing out like go here, why not? This looks like I can, but whatever, that's how the car feels where it's like you're trying to... I did my E3 demo spin. Oh yeah, just let you know Neil and Bruce; you ever need me to come and I was going to I wasn't going to really shoot him, but I wanted to see what would happen. But every time you want me to get up there do the slow pan around show some of the panoramics for The Last of Us Part II.

Like I never, I never died and I never flipped it, you know what I mean? You can... it's interesting which is good, yeah, like that's fun for this game.

And this isn't this is very much your moment to moment Uncharted which is great, don't get me wrong, great gameplay, I had fun playing this all I want to do is play more but it's an interesting movie-like move and I thought I originally told you like that's weird and then I was like well I guess I remember Uncharted 2 the first thing we ever saw was when we were going through the streets, the Jeep's chasing us down the stairs, we're shooting as we run from it. But even that had like that epic moment to it where this the Epic moment here is like I'm using the winch for the first time, I'm learning how to mark people, I'm doing this different thing, I...it's funny I actually had a different experience with it where I this and",

I'm sure you notice in the middle of your style, which I think is a great addition. You know, um, it's this is an evolved form of Uncharted in a way that I didn't expect to be like, I the you know we've seen the other trailers and stuff, and that I'm like all right, cool, Uncharted; it's Uncharted 4 makes sense.

Yeah, and so you'll see here this Tall Grass you could be you could use for stealth where you go in Nate would automatically Crouch and I do believe yeah you see him doing it there you'll see it coming up in a second before some other stuff happens but I don't do much of it cuz you know I'm an Uncharted which means I go in there, I kill things, and fall in love with Elena. Yeah, yeah, what's up Elena? You want to get married again? I love you. Let's renew our vows. I hope we don't have a child in this game. Why do I keep lying to you? I hope we both survive. So when I came to this thing, I didn't want to do stealth first; I wanted to just drive as fast as you ran over a couple guys, I killed a couple people with the Jeep and that made me happy but I got taken down real fast. But then eventually I went in stealth until I got caught, and then that's when the Rope moment happened, and I I wanted to talk about the Rope, I will use it coming up, but not no not\"",

The shot, yeah. The rope is another thing that impressed me with this game and with this demo - we all saw that PSX demo when he ropes down and punches that dude in the face like oh my God, that is amazing. But is that some canned animation? This today proved to me no, that rope is very versatile and you're going to use it in a bunch of different ways - um sometimes to attack someone, sometimes to just climb somewhere. It controls a little they're a little cumbersome for me but at chapter 10, howp uh because you have to you use you hit L1 and he",

Um, but I'm sure I'll get used to it. But it's cool because you can use the rope, and then you can go out, and you can either just keep swinging this way or stop and go up, or swing this way and it's like controlling it, and you can use it to swing to another building and kind of go down so you're still hiding from people, and then crawl up and shoot people or do what I didn't swing around and shoot people, but that doesn't work well.

It has not gone well, but I have not died, which I hang my hat on - you know what I mean? Yeah, cuz you know I haven't played Uncharted in a long time, let alone new-school Uncharted, where apparently you shoot barrels and people know where you are - that's not how Uncharted used to be. No, I don't know what changed, I don't know why they decided to move that war changed. War changed finally. Wow, I thought it never changed but it finally changed. I also found this is something that uh is probably just me getting used to it - I think part of it's the Division I've been playing so much Division, so much third-person Division, where I feel like when I pop out I know exactly where my reticle is going to be, and here I did not feel that.

Now, this is an interesting point in the demo, not for you at home, you're probably bored, but for us, I scale this thing, I've killed all these guys, but then you called in reinforcements here right? Okay, I didn't do that; they did so there's this tower you're kind of going up right yeah and as I was going up and I was still fighting the guys like you took them all out when you were down there um but I I took them more like I'm going to rope around and like do some crazy stuff, so I was doing that and just making my way up this tower and I got a sniper eventually and I started sniping people and that was really satisfying.
