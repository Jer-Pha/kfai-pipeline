Yes, our track record continues that we record this on Mondays, post it on Tuesdays, and for some reason, PlayStation News always breaks Monday evening, but this time we're nipping in the bud, Colin Moriarty, Pride of Long Island. I'm Greg Miller. Of course, you'll get your real intro and your regular old show. We talk about tomatoes for a good 5 to 10 minutes in the beginning of the real show. So, now you can't say that we started the show without video game news for a while. We nailed these nerds. You know, that's always fun you nerds. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, we're here doing this very special uh interrupt us to the regular show and add-on if you will because Neo is real apparently.

I would love you to read it and give credit to Giant Bomb. Giant Bomb's Austin Walker writes and to that I follow Giant Bomb very closely, but I had no idea Giant Bomb really broke news. So, I was really surprised to see that they were the source of this, but maybe I'm just totally wrong and I just I'm ignorant on that. Sources: The upgraded PlayStation 4 is code-named Neo, all in capital letters. Contains upgraded CPU, GPU, and RAM. Says, \"Earlier this year, rumors began to fly that Sony would release an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4, a console often called the PS4.5 or the PS4K by fans and press. Today, multiple sources have confirmed for us details of the project, which is internally referred to as the Neo. No price was provided, but previous reports indicate that the Neo would sell at $399.

No price was provided, but previous reports indicate that the PS4 Neo would sell at $399. At time of publishing, Sony has not returned our request for comment, but we will update the story if the company responds. The PS4 Neo will feature a higher clock speed than the original PS4 and improved GPU and higher bandwidth on the memory. The documents we've received note that the HDD in the PS4 Neo is the same as in the original PlayStation 4, but it's not clear if that means in terms of capacity or connection speed. Starting in October, every PS4 game is required to ship with both a base mode, which will run on the currently available PS4 and a neo mode for use on the new console. Um, so they have a comparison here. So, the original PS4 CPU is eight Jaguar cores at 1.6 GHz. The new Neo is eight Jaguar cores at 2.1 GHz. Feel those gigahertz, you guys. GPU AMD GCN 18 CUS at 800 MHz. And the new PS4 Neo",

And then it says eight for the Neo, 8 GB GDDR5, 218 GB per second. And I'm sorry if I mispronounced anything. I don't know anything about technology. Oh, come on. You've been using an AMD GCN for as long as I've known you. GCN means Graphics Core Next to me. Uh, games running in Neo mode will be able to use the hardware upgrades and an additional 512 megabytes in the memory budget to offer increased and more stable frame rate and higher visual fidelity at least when those games run at 1080p on HD TVs.

In the documents we've received, Sony offered suggestions for reaching 4K/ Ultra HD resolutions for Neo mode game builds, but they've also been giving developers a degree of freedom with how to approach this. 4K TV owners should expect the Neo to upscale games to fit the format, but one place Sony is unwilling to bend is on frame rate. Throughout the document, Sony repeatedly reminds developers that the frame rate of games in the Neo mode must meet or exceed the frame rate of the game of the original PS4 system. The Neo will not supplant the current PS4, but will exist alongside it and use the same user environment. The PS4 and Neo will use the same PSN store, connect to the same online communities, and offer the same user experience. So, expect to see the same cross media bar that you used to.

Players will also be able to retain all their purchases they made on the PS4. Sony seems committed to keeping the Neo and the original PS4 player bases connected. As such, there will be no Neo only games, and Sony will not let developers separate Neo users from original PS4 players while playing on PSN. Likewise, Sony explicitly and repeatedly states that developers cannot offer exclusive gameplay options or special unlockables for Neo players. So, don't expect Neo owners to get a level editor or a special Rocket League card that won't have access to that you won't have access to on your original PS4. That said, so long as both systems have the same feature, the Neo can run an improved version. A local co-op game that features four players on the base PS4 could offer an eight-player co-op on the Neo, for instance. But again, don't expect those",

But again, don't expect those differences to transfer to online modes. PS4 base and Neo versions of a game will also have to have parity with regard to peripheral support. So, don't expect Neo games to have exclusive VR modes. Sony makes no mention of PlayStation VR in the docs we've seen, so it's hard to know what this means for persistent rumors that this upgraded PS4 will be able to support PSVR without the breakout box that the headset ships with. That said, so long as the Neo's upgrade applies to PSVR games, developers should be able to get even more performance out of Sony's VR headset. Though, every PS4 game released as of October this year will need support for both the original PS4 and the Neo. That doesn't necessarily mean that the Neo will release in October.

The documents we received explicitly note that devs are allowed to launch Neo Ready games before the Neo itself releases. Games released previous to the Neo can take advantage of this hardware upgrade, but only if developers decide to patch their titles. Um, and that's basically it. Okay. How do you feel, Colin? You were very down on it coming in. Still down. I'm more down. I'm more down about it now. Why are you more down? Because they say the story says that rumors indicate that it's $399 that they don't know that necessarily the price like Austin hadn't heard the price but that's not really true.

Cuz now what you're telling everyone is that console you bought a year and a half ago at $400 is now inferior to the one everyone else is buying for the same exact price that you just bought your PS4 from. And on Twitter, I just tweeted out, you know, reiterating what I'm hearing. And people are like, I mean, almost everyone's like, this is total tweet about it.

James Zang, I 100% agree with No Taxation. I bought a PS4 only four months ago and now I need might need to upgrade and I was an Xbox before. This is a terrible, terrible move. I don't understand. They're going to have to spin this. Yeah. In a very unique way. They're going to have to sell it for sure. Austin Walker says on his own Twitter account, Austin Walker being the writer of the, you know, the Giant Bomb article says, \"For every person who says, I don't get why people are upset, 10 are telling me they are.\" And then he says, \"It isn't whether they're right to be upset.\" Um, and that's in context of like what I",

Sure. Now, yes, the internet goes crazy with things. But Greg, this is an optical nightmare. People comparing this to cell phones are missing the point. What is the point? The point is that a cell phone has been upgraded every 18 months for 20 years. When's the last time you had a cell phone for more than 2 years ever? I've had a cell phone for 16 years and I've never had a cell phone for more. I think the 5S that I have is the longest I've ever had a phone. It's like 18 months. We are used to that.

But with this, of course, it's going to be better, but we are not in an environment in the console space where people are used to And I don't want to reiterate things we've said over and over again about the PS4.5/4K because we talked about so much.

Right now, this is a very unique situation. There has been no reiteration of the PS4. In other words, they have not tried to release the PS4 with the same innards or comparable innards and making it cheaper, which is the first time they've ever done that with PlayStation. They've done that with every piece of hardware they've ever released. PS1, PS2, PSP, PS3, Vita all get redesigns that make them cheaper with and play the games identically.

Like it would have been better for them to go in 2018 at E3 or 2018. and they hold a a conference and they're like, \"This is the PlayStation 5 completely backwards compatible with PS4, but now we can do all these cool things with PSVR and we're going to have our own new games.

But if you had the old PS4, if you're one of the 40 million people that supported us, oh, you get the shitty version of the games now.

It answers so many questions that would explain why he took the time, I'm sorry, why he took up the name Drake, and has always been fascinated with the pirate. Something we've never had a clear answer to. It would account for the pirate asset seen on the Naughty Dog computer screens a while back that had people speculating there'd be a chapter where you play as Sir Francis Drake. It would be consistent with the game's supernatural twist endings and the time manipulation item in multiplayer.

In fact, on last week's podcast, you both chuckled after Colin joked about it coming out in 2024. I will start off saying, \"I am 100% confident this game will release in 2016. Sony must know how ridiculous it would make them look to resurrect a game 6 years after its initial announcement at E3 2009 and then delay it.\" Our own Shuhei Yoshida, praise be to Shu, said in an interview in November 2015 that they wouldn't be showing much more of the game because it is heavily story focused and any footage may be spoilery. So, please indulge my wild speculation. E3 2016 Shu or Shawn Layden walks out on stage and says, quote, \"The Last",

But the team behind The Last Guardian, beloved as they are, have never been blockbuster sellers and as exclusive as exclusively single-player games, it would behoove Sony to encourage digital adoption so people don't just pick up the used copies and run through the story. P.S. I love chicken wings. I am Russian. Uh well, yeah, The Last Guardian team have never been crazy sellers, but Shadow of the Colossus did very well. Sure. Critically, the thing about it is like The Last Guardian is one of those games people know about.

Um, but then they have the twin stick shooters in a more traditional arcade sense like Stardust and Resogun. And I think those are the cream of the crop games that they make.

Uh, I want to I want to give a shout out to Sports Champions because Sports Champions along with Sorcery and Dead Nation's Quest are really the four move games that are worth anything at all. Sure. And they're all good to great. And of course that game where you slide down the hill on a chair. Oh my god. What the **** was that game called? I can I can envision the logo. Game sucks. It's terrible. Just so many bad **** games. I don't even want to know. Don't even tell me. Get Sorcery, too. Time for the PSN's worst name of the week. This one comes from a username on the forums, Torpedo Nuts. Now, this is a It's a walk, but I enjoyed the ride. Is it a walk or is it a ride? I mean, it can be the same. Oh, good day, gentlemen.

I wanted to share my PSN name origin story with you. Let's address the elephant in the room first. My PSN name is just dandy. Two words. Horrible? Not at all. But it's definitely not what I should have been. Let's travel back to the year 2008. Insert Wayne Gretzky time travel dissolve. My wife and I had just gotten married. And like many newlyweds, money was tight. So I did what any sane gamer would do. I sold her Nintendo Wii. Yes, she was pissed off at first, but eventually she came to realize that the words I spoke were true indeed. Quote, \"The Wii is a piece of **** disguised as a gaming machine.\" End quote. Fast forward a few weeks to when my wife gives me the best birthday gift ever. Knowing my love of Metal Gear, she comes home with the Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots PlayStation 3 bundle.

Quote. Really? My wife pipes up. What? That's my gamer name. I reply. Suddenly, doubt creeps into my mind. I pause for a second. Then I proceed to erase Turok forever. I hum and haw for a few brief moments. Then I type in my backup handle. Dandy Warhol. Quote, \"What the hell is a Dandy Warhol?\" she asks. Okay, seriously, it's a band I like. Joy turns quickly to anger at this point because we're arguing over a goddamn name when I should be kicking ass with Solid Snake. Quote, \"Fine, just Dandy it is.\" I type it in and pound the X button, thinking I'd simply change it at a later date. Quote, \"It's still pretty lame,\" she jabs",

That's how my lame ass PSN name came to be. Oh, what I would give to restore torpedo nuts to its rightful place among the PSN gaming universe. Please, Shuhei Yoshida, let us change our freaking names. Thanks for everything you guys do, keeping us informed and entertained with everything PlayStation. Sincerely, Torpedo Nuts, aka Just Andy.

I need your song in both a YouTube video, so at the end of our YouTube video, I annotate to you, and an MP3, so at the end of our MP3, I play your song. Today's song comes from Levi Clay 88. He writes in it and says, \"Hey guys, my last track never made it, but this one is topical, so I thought I'd submit a new one.\" Fly Away was written for my debut album after my nana died very suddenly right before I moved country.

The Hellcat, one word, Molly, its own word, out of the ashes, which can be found on all outlets like iTunes, Amazon, and hellcat.bandcamp.com. I hope someone out there enjoys it and remembers to tell someone you love them because you never know when you might not be able to do that anymore. It's like Mike + The Mechanics in the Living Years. The most depressing song ever written. I'm not familiar with Oh, you are definitely familiar with that. Give me a few bars. Uh, say it. Oh, yeah.
