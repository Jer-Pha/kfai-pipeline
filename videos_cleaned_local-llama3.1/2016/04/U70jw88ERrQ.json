Especially when you when we set out to make Shadow Complex, um, there just weren't there weren't not only were there not a lot of side-scrollers being made, but there was absolutely no... you know, a non-linear Metroid-esque side-scroller being made at all. And you know, anyone we talk to about it's like, \"You're crazy if you're not making a first-person shooter or like a cover-based third-person action game.\" Like, you're done. And we're like, \"No, I we just really believe that if we make it, they will come. Right? There will be an audience for this type of a game.\" And it's just been so immensely satisfying to... to not only make that game but to have it win, you know, over 50 Game of the Year awards.",

You left it behind, you hung it out to dry, you never made a sequel. I hear you got maps for it though, you got everything planned out, you just got to sit down... no, it's okay. But for Shadow Complex, I mean like to think back to when that came out, when it came out on Xbox 360 - that was still when downloadable games were looked down upon and it was \"it's pretty good for a downloadable game\" and like \"we'll do these Games of the Year but we'll do download XBL game of the year and stuff like that\"... no.

Um, I mean I wouldn't say that that's not one of the reasons why we're doing yeah no, I mean that's definitely part of it. I mean we loved making Shadow Complex and the truth is so in in we did you know intense study of what we thought made the Metroid games work so well and some of the Castlevania games work so well, and you know could we put our own spin on that but really kind of find the vibe of and the soul of what made those things work. And to me by the end of making Shadow Complex was when I'm like all right I know actually how to make one of these games like now I could actually go make a really good one, and so for me Shadow Complex was like you know our warm-up like",

And then you just shut it all down and P no, like we really knew how to do it and we did. We immediately went into developing Shadow Complex 2 and we worked on that for about nine months. Um, Greg's not wrong and we did we did we we laid out we had the whole game designed on paper um we even yeah I mean we blocked the whole game in in in BSP just think of it as like just like rough like gray box everything and yeah I mean we can you know I've I can play through Shadow Complex 2 not in it's not with all the AI and it's not beautiful at all it's say blocks but you can play through the whole thing from start to finish and it's amazing like it it is probably one of the best things I think that we've designed um but as we were doing that you know Steve Jobs called and and said hey do you",

And we're like, 'Oh, yeah, yeah, we'll pause Shadow Complex for a little bit and go do this thing with Apple.' That became Infinity Blade, and yeah, it became just this huge thing. And again, we love Infinity Blade. I think there's some of the innovations we were able to bring to mobile and the design space there that are so innovative and we've been so fortunate to be successful there. Um, but yeah, I mean we really want to get back to Shadow Complex if it warrants it. So um, if you want more Shadow Complex, you know, get the remaster, see if you guys tell us you want it.

Well, and I think again, like I mean if this is getting way boring we can just change the subject, but I think yeah, like the technology - the technology curve of like how again not like making a game is easy by any means again which is why the huge quality disparity it's not easy to make a good quality product right. But the curve of being able to make that and then the curve of user experience from a store standpoint I don't know that any of the people that designed the storefronts in any of the platforms we have, I don't even have the opportunity to think through like how do you service hundreds of thousands of things in a way that can actually be organized and sorted?

Yeah, exactly. It's it to me, and it's probably such a simplistic and ignorant way of looking at it from my point of view, but like could PlayStation for instance have just a number of people, 20 people, that are just like these are the games that are inert right now?
