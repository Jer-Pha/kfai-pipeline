Well, there'll be something I don't know. My iPad has 1% power, so I need to read through this question all right. Oh my God, I'm opening it a lot of pressure. This one comes from Daniel Brady he says customs and culture after having traveled from New Zealand to America and Mexico for a few weeks in January, I experienced some customs that are not very common in New Zealand. The two main ones I realized were the overall outgoing attitude in comparison to New Zealand (where we tend to be much more reserved and laid-back) and the existence of a tipping culture. I found these two cultural differences novel and interesting even though to you guys it's considered normal. What are some customs you have run into during your travels? Were they positive? Have you experienced any form of culture shock? Did it before it died and",

Um, tipping was one that was a big one; um, we just don't tip; we were like wait, we do we don't even have like a set percentage it's like oh the meal was good put down a couple of quid.

It's also the same way back home in New York, the service can be inconsistent. But restaurants that have great service, like we talk about Nopa a lot, which I still think is the best restaurant in San Francisco. Um, some people think the food isn't like astronomically good, but it's amazing, I think it's amazing food. But the service is like **** through the roof good and like you, you're dealing with like five different people at a time, like they'll just like everything's fine, everything's great.
