My whole reaction to Rogue One since it was announced was that I... I think I... I was I was definitely more excited about it than I was about the trilogy about these standalones, and that I felt like it was going to be a better movie because it doesn't rely on what we already know and love. So it's not making up a new story or anything like that. So I only watched it twice, and I... I was uh quite impressed with what I saw. Yeah, and I think in addition to what you're saying, not only is it not confined to somewhere that we know, this is the story we're going to see, the end of this movie, and it's not going to be a post-credit scene setting up a trilogy here's some characters that you have questions about what's Riz's history?

And same thing with speeder bikes and stuff like that: when we see AT-ATs in The Empire Strikes Back, we associate them with Hoth. What I liked about the imagery at the end was that, like, that planet was tropical - it's a desert planet with palm trees - and it's the exact antithesis of Hoth. And I was like, 'That's a very clever and I think intentional way to kind of mess with your visuals.' Because we see them on Hoth walking through snow - I mean, that's how we always will see AT-ATs. So I liked the familiarity and then it goes towards Mon Mothma, who I don't know where they found that woman - she was in Revenge of the Sith as well. Well, oh, same actress - okay, well that's interesting. So some interesting crossover between the Rogue One movie and The Force Awakens, which is cool too - like, speeding.\"",

It's like I, the other character I'm super interested in, um, apart from the Grand Admiral, um, is... and the questions I have about where Vader is and who's got to be in it and Tarkin has to be - and I don't know how you don't have Tarkin in the movie. That was one of the major philosophical challenges they're going to have in making this movie. But also like, who the samurai guy was; cuz it looked like he was...

So like being so married to the original trilogy in that lore in that world, this is really exciting to me to get the kind of put some new puzzle pieces in that establish these backstories as opposed to like something you know we don't really know what episode 8 is and that's exciting in its own way but this to me is like way more exciting.

Like I feel like I'm not about diversity for diversity sake, I think that's a negative thing in fiction. I think you have to be true to your fiction, but I think Star Wars has always empowered women - Mon Mothma is a great example of that, and so is Princess Leia, obviously. So um, and even when you learn about some other female characters in the old EU Canon and stuff like that, like Mara Jade and stuff... doesn't exist anymore. So to me it seemed like a logical thing to have another female lead and I think that it is positive for the story, I think it's empowering - not necessarily for men or for women but just for Star Wars fans. Like we've had the female perspective before, I don't understand why this is such a big deal. We had Padm\u00e9, we had Leia.\"",
