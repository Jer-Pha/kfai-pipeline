This goes back to the Apple II and to the IBM PC in 1981. I mean this is not this is not a new phenomenon. You know there were PCs in '85, '86 way more powerful than the NES. There were consoles or PCs way more powerful and Macs way more powerful in 1991, 1992 around the SNES and Genesis era. This is an ancient problem - games like Doom ran on PCs much more sophisticated than games like or consoles like SNES and Doom was ported and had to be really dumped down to fit onto these things so this is this is not a new phenomenon.

You're actually in a space where you expect that this console is going to be good and solid for you for at least a few more years - maybe five, six, seven years.

These are not games; these are not consoles that run the games any differently. That's what I'm saying: like these are not steps up. These are the opposite - the PS3 Slim was designed to make the console cheaper, and the... the Xbox 360 Elite maybe not, but like the well, yeah, so when the Xbox 360 started to iterate on it, thing it was to make the components cheaper and cheaper to go at retail.

It is not the same because no, it is not new to have redesigned consoles. It's new to have a redesigned console that's more expensive than the old console. I can't think of a single example of that ever happening. The Elite is different because why? Because Xbox 3, like with the Xbox 360, yeah they added some internet stuff or what, like Wi-Fi was built in so you didn't have to have the hard drive thing. That's irrelevant too.

I don't think it's $249, I've been out of the loop maybe, I don't know, I'm on it, I got the device in my hand, we're just assuming that this is a new thing, it's going to be the Neo or the 4.5 or whatever, what if this just is the PlayStation 4 because they say that the documentation as far as the leaks are concerned saying that the two consoles will split and will be side by side and they'll continue to sell them but this particular argument Tim",

And when we quickly saw with that was that the Game Boy Advance was obsolete and was removed. The Game Boy Advance actually was a fantastic system that was, I thought, disappeared very quickly because the DS was just a better unit. So they had some anticipation that the GBA would last into maybe 2006 and it did, I guess, in some respect last until five or so but it was gone. I mean the Game Boy's prime time was three years long and the DS's prime time really was still going until last year or two years ago so it's like where there were still kind of new and unique games being released for it",

God, I love the Game Boy Advance and 350. Right now, sorry, I thought I thought that's what it was. So, it's it's to me it's um it's a great example of like well Nintendo had something great with the DS and it sold very well and I enjoyed it. I remember telling a story I think on PS I love you or something - Colin, Greg, I was like I didn't believe it until I played it and I was like this is great but they didn't have to kill the GBA like that and this is this is kind of like... there was no imperative for them to do that.

And that goes to question number five: \"like what do you think this is?\" This seems like premature, this seems to me to be a half-measure.

You guys do know that console games and development actually can have graphic settings in a menu taken from the PC version or in a debug menu that you can change. Right, developer effort will come more in the sense that they have to keep the different performance budgets in mind, meaning if you need to keep let's say your polygon budget under 30 million for the PS4/Xbox One version, you make a graphics setting around that, then the PS4K would have an undefined number.

They added gimmicks and everything, and it doesn't work. And I just don't understand like what the real thought was besides let's let's shoehorn the gyro controls and all this because the Wii U has a GamePad so we need to do all that stuff for all of its faults - the on-rail missions being the biggest fault; those sucked, they were atrocious. But the in-game missions were awesome; they were just as good as the Star Fox 64 missions, and the story continued it.

I don't know if it's the most of any of their consoles; I wouldn't know that for sure. My assumption would be actually the DS probably had the most Nintendo-published things. Um, but the NES specifically, like launch games - I mean there was like almost no one making games for the NES except for Nintendo for a couple years.

I mean, Mario Kart is a huge smash by the I mean, what game are they going to make other than a 3D Mario game that's going to sell more than those? I think it's the Mario or the Zelda games.

When you combined the two, most people look at Nintendo fans as Nintendo fans, not necessarily Wii U fans or 3DS fans - right? It was like there was a good solid stream coming divided across two things, which is not ideal. If we get that output on both the NX, I think that's great - that's a great thing. Add on some third-party support, add on some other things. What's really exciting me is something Nintendo's not always done, but since the GameCube era, where they partner with and trust third parties - I think that's a great way to use third parties to make Nintendo games.

So should developers make games less hard? No, I don't think so. Oh, make them harder they should but definitely less frustrating. Frustrating is...

Uh, I thought this was a story tied to her. Oh, she would have... did I tell the story before? Yeah, but it might have been an exclusive or whatever. Maybe she took us to the garage sale okay. Um, but yeah, it was the biggest come-up I've ever had. It was 20 games, and we're talking everything: all the Marios, Ninja Turtles, um, all the Zeldas. $7. There were like two zappers; I don't even know why I needed that. There were like four controllers; it was just ridiculous. So that was amazing.
