Um, and it's just interesting, right? The reason we run our own studio is so we can do not a sequel every year; it just gets boring. So now, how long have you been working on this game? Uh, too long. I was going to say has Severed begun to get boring? Uh, we're happy about finishing it this week or next. Um, it'll be out soon on PlayStation Vita, I think. We've been doing Severed for about two years; is that sound right? About two years, yeah, about two years. Uh, has it broken you, Graham? Uh, no, actually I'm pretty happy with the game. Uh, but it would be nice to work on something new for a change. Gotcha, Graham. Graham's a shell of a man right now. Can raise the volume on the Vita? Absolutely, better max it out there; it goes now it's maxed out. Cool, the Vita decide this is all it needs for volume, you know.",

Well we hope or we need people to come back to it uh yeah look I mean for sure the original title we put out on Vita were awesome uh reception wise and also the numbers we pushed on it were great um again back then Vita users tend to be really hardcore in buy games right now they are too I'm hoping that's still the case, right, yeah.",

I don't know if you can get an upgrade out of anym... yeah, so this one will upgrade my damage. Oh, and that's your character on the right by the way - that's Sasha. I should have mentioned her; uh, you probably should have. She's pretty awesome. Sexist? Yeah, I... I... am. We can cut that out, right? Yeah, uh, you'll notice that also Sasha is missing an arm, which is pretty a pretty big deal.

So sometimes this game's a lot about managing the enemies to the left and right of you so you can imagine you move to the left, you block one, then move back to the enemy that you're focusing on. Um, and you'll also see, besides health and magic that Sasha will have, there's this well, the fight ended, that was a terrible like wa live demos what could go wrong uh but she has a a bar that's called her Focus meter, and so the longer you will fight a single enemy, you gain Focus. Uh, and so once your focus meter is Max out, you start doing Uber damage. Um, but your focus meter is sort of performance dependent, so if you get hit, uh, you won't fill it up as fast.

Greg just showing off here, so how meaty is the campaign? Because I, I always wanted Guacamelee for instance to be longer because it was so good, but it was still a tight experience and it was still a game that I platinumed twice - I platin on V and I platin on PS4. Nice, um, so I obviously enjoyed the game quite a bit; I enjoyed it, uh. So are we looking at like a similar eight hour kind of thing here with Severed? Yeah for sure, uh, I think that's pretty much on the mark. We've been bringing play testers in for about a month and it seems to be the range of 6 to 10 hours; there's additional side content that's harder content so people want to put more time into it.

What do you think of for pricing?\" Great question! I think we're probably going to make it a standard small indie game price. You know, I'm guessing it'll probably be free, with micro payments to advance and get your arm back. You have to pay, yeah. I mean, we haven't decided yet, but it's probably going to be around $5 maybe above or below.
