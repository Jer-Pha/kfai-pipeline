Yeah, you were right about that. Remember, they were like, you were excited that you thought you had Sweet Tarts and then they were Spree. Well, I mean, well even, well, don't fucking talk to the Sweet Tarts. I overdosed on that shit. When you take it, then you like, you pound it all out and then you snort it.

We got great seats largely because there was not a lot of people in the theater, which was not a good sign, but I held out. I was like maybe this will surprise me and it did. I actually enjoyed the I mean I enjoyed the movie almost the entire way through with the exception of like time out real quick. By the way, this is going to be a spoiler filled discussion. That's why we kick from out, but I didn't tell you the viewer. So just a heads up here. If you haven't seen Batman v Superman, this is probably chance to bolt 321.

Like just that. He played that doofy aloof character there for a second. I was like, that was cool. So I thought that worked. I really liked the relationship between him and Jeremy Irons. And I think that's again, something we haven't really seen before on film. They're not, it's not the, you stop doing this, you're going to die. Stop doing it. It's like, we passed that point 10 years ago. And now it's been 10 years since of me just kicking the shit out of everyone. And this guy is no longer my Butler.

And I think, you know, we were talking earlier today where they're going to add what, 30 minutes to the Blu-ray, right? Yeah. They just feel like as of recording today is when they put out the communion scene of Luther in the Genesis chamber, looking at what he's talking about, a post-apocalyptic person of some kind. So I feel like that's really going to kind of start to fill in some of the blanks which were from what I can glean a number of the criticisms that people have of it, right? Was that it just wasn't the Lex Luther stuff kind of came out of nowhere. It wasn't really supported.

Just like, all right, what more questions like the, the clip that came out today? Sure. What? What is that? Exactly what I was telling you was going to, I thought happened. A bunch of like, where did the, like the army looking at or not army, like the, the dudes coming in, like hell of a, why they're the government they're there to apprehend Luther.

Now I think it's that gap of like, you know how, when it ended, like when we talked about another thing and I don't want to, I want to give you guys your time. We talked about the fact of like when Luther's going into a maniac mode or whatever and I'm like, why is he suddenly doing this? Why, why, why and you get to the end and he's like clearly on his hands and he's talking to like I kept saying I wish when they shaved his head, there was an omega symbol in the back and you'd be like he's an agent of the dark side.

I didn't put it together that that wasn't supposed to be a Mother Box in their world that he, he fuses to Victor to make Cyborg.

I know that that's not really the way Batman is, but that's a Batman I'd like to see. Cause I think it's more realistic. Batman being a character with no superpowers, it makes more sense that he would be a more grounded character rather or not. The universe itself is grounded. I also like Kal-El Superman.

If they're not cheering because they like Aquaman, I think they liked the fact that Jason Momoa might make Aquaman cool.

Like Watchmen people, people's problem with Watchmen wasn't that the story didn't make sense or that the action wasn't cool. They just went in expecting Batman v Superman and they got Watchmen, which is not a superhero story. It's a very cerebral, like fuck that tale about like what would happen to real superheroes.

It's like opposites where it's like, this movie is just a flaw and has some good things. Whereas Rises was good. It had some flaws, you know? And I think that that's just a big problem.

Let me ask you this. Well, we, we really should wrap this up, but I do have this fundamental question. Sure. Superman attracts all of these enemies, right? From being on planet earth. So like, it's his fault. All of this is happening anyway. That's like a huge problem. Like no, none of them would ever have come to earth. None of them. What do you not a hundred percent sure. Not a hundred. The Dark Side thing, the Dark Side thing, Dark Side is wants to rule the universe. He's looking for planets with intelligent life. So that's the whole thing.

Other than that, like I don't talk to anyone on the phone. I don't like getting phone calls from people. It's weird. Like, you know, like, like from the, like, like, you know, like more peripheral people when someone's calling, I'm like, why are you calling me? Because like, to me, it's like, so does something bad happen? That's what I always think about when I see like some random person. I'm like, are you like, who the fuck is this? Is this like either like a doctor's appointment that I forgot about or someone's dead? Did I, cause like no one, no one calls each other anymore. I wish I talked to a few other people more like my siblings and stuff, but we just really text more to more to Nick's point though.

That's how the kids do it now. I mean, anyway, like you have my cell phone, like why would you choose Instagram? That is the annoying part when you find a DM or something from somebody who didn't care about getting in touch. Sorry to interrupt you call them. I apologize. No, it's fine.

Like it's nice to, to focus on the, this, the relationships you do have and, and harness whatever energy you have to kind of maintain those relationships as opposed to like spreading yourself too thin. And that's the lesson I think of a cell phone and text messaging specifically is just social media is largely bullshit. It's just fun. A fun way to interact with other people and your friends specifically. But the whole text message thing is like, it's just too easy. And then like when you don't get back to someone and you feel bad about it, but it's like, I like, what do we have to say to each other? This is weird.

Let me give a shout out there real quick to something. When I was a kid, I used to like getting sick sometimes. Cause I used to get to use Diamond Mist and that shit tastes mad good. Was that the orange one? It was great. It was great. Diamond Mist was fucking legit. I was like, Oh damn. Like I was sick. You got to get me some diamonds. Yeah, exactly. Even my favorite jelly sandwiches on my, on my little Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles tray. So I'm just going to give a shout out real quick to Diamond Mist. That shit's no joke. Yeah, but Joe",

It's like D I M E T A P P. I think you never heard of DiamondTaco. You can't spell it. He's heard of it. I just take DiamondTaco. I can try. You know, the same type of deal where like, you know, kids in high school were drinking Robitussin. You know, to get fucked up. Pretty fucked up. I mean, I wonder if that happens to be the same thing with DiamondTaco, but I don't know. I don't really know anything about that. I swear to God. Oh man. Are you kidding me? I would try anything.

Yeah. Like when you're, when you're eight and you get a giant snifter of brandy, she's like, come on, keep, come on, be a man, be a man. You can take that. Be a man, monkey bastard.

And so my grandmother was like, I think I just always remember her being like 85 and being the size of Herman Munster. And she was terrifying. She had like size 13 shoes and she would just grab me by the hair and like, throw us into the closet. If we were being bad, you monkey bastards. And she would throw you in the closet and you're like, this seems like it's child abuse. It was bad. It was bad. But we didn't care.

You have the emotional scars now, but otherwise it was good. You wonder why I get pissed off at people really quickly. Take a little diamond tap. You'll be fine. Oh, Robitussin syrup.
