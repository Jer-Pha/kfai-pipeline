She says if she's angry with him, she wouldn't want anything doing. He says they're both into it enough; it's possible to have sex but still be angry with each other. He always tells her they need to have \"Angry Sex Sunday.\" So now I want to get your expert opinions first off, we're not actually... second off, this sounds like a horrible situation. Yeah, it's about you so an angry sex is like not aggressive, like physical sex but like I'm infuriated. Yeah, I can't believe you said that to my mother. Exactly right. Let's have sex because I feel like there's the makeup sex... yeah argue and that happens but it's like all right we're in the middle of a fight. You know what would be good right now some ****.

Yeah, that is a Garrett ten excellent point, yeah what don't you find that there are and this probably doesn't segue into what he's actually talking about it aren't there people that you just want to have sex with oh I can't stand that human being Jesus Christ John yes yes yeah do not like him bang exact great I",
