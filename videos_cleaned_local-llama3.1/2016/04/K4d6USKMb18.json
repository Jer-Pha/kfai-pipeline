Went to patreon.com kind of funny and supported us there to get his topic right on the show, just like you can. His topic starts very simply with police encounters. First I want to state that at one time I was a police officer but my career ended due to multiple gunshot wounds. I think he's probably not serious, wow okay, he's a rapper now of course everybody goes support TTR. Okay well secondly I want to advise that I am in no way advocating drunk or buzz driving please call a friend it's very important also if someone's putting poop on your car do not tell your friends on their podcast yeah make sure you but don't resort to violence we're going to find nonviolent means of dealing with the dude. You have no idea that guy will lose his mind when I just stand up like hey what the f***, I'll be really loud cuz I can get loud.",

It was a couple of months before I was to report to Police Academy. I was at a bar with a friend and we decided to continue the party at his place. I wanted to get a few things for my house first, I grabbed some items including a six-pack of Budweiser Ice uh on my way to my friend's place, I was pulled over in front of a convenience store. The officer asked if I'd been drinking, I said yes and just and I also let him know that I was about to enter the police academy. He ran my license when he came back, he asked if he could have someone pick me up, I said yes, he told me to pull into the convenience store parking lot and wait. I called my friend.",

The only reason we were flying down there and not driving was because it was so cheap to fly - you guys remember, it was ridiculously cheap to fly in 2002 and 2003. I remember getting here and back from JFK for like literally $150 um in like 2003. So it's but it's one of those things where like someone has to stand up and be like well we don't submit to the terrorists by like removing our rights and like submitting to constitutional infringements because like they can be like well you when you fly you don't have Fourth Amendment rights, and it's like okay so do I have First Amendment rights when I fly or do I just give those to you",
