You can watch it, of course, on YouTube.com/KindaFunny... uh, KindaFunnyLive too - same idea. No, it's a two-day event now, filled with special guests, filled with crazy things, filled with skits, filled with podcasts, filled with autographs, filled with meet-and-greets; fill the drinks if you're of age; if you're not of age, you can finally come so no we like to make the event.\"",

Well, for me anyway, so the Final Fantasy 15 Ultimate Collector's Edition was very limited; it had 30,000 units worldwide, which sold out in minutes. I live in Australia, and thus could not buy the product off the Square Enix store as they do not ship to my country. Australia received 80 copies for our entire country, so of course I could not get my hands on it. I've been waiting for this game for 10 years, so my question is basically: Do you think this is fair? And what are your opinions on the matter? He says, \"Man... um, have you experienced anything like this sheer disappointment?\" Keep up the great work, KZB. PS I hope they make more copies from Me Down Under. PPS I hope Tim has his copy ordered; I'm very jealous.

Maybe you get something out of it, but you could also go and just have another Second Son. I mean, look what Insomniac did with Sly Cooper 4, that's a really great game, you know? So, so it can go both ways. What Bend Studio did with Resistance, even though it was a totally different game on a different platform. So I think that it can go both ways. I don't think you could just call it either way, you know? You have to have the right team, the right feel, the right platform.",

That won't happen; The Last of Us Part II is definitely going to happen. I just don't think we're really jumping the gun; I think again that's probably a next year showing an E3 game. I think that that might be too soon. Yeah, um, cuz you have to assume that they're in pre-production on it but and and maybe even working on it in some way. I mean Uncharted is gold now so um so it's time for that team to move on to DLC and multiplayer sport and then the other the rest of the team so take a lot of time off and then post-crunch kind of come back and and and figure out what they're going to do next, so The Last Us two is going to",

Final question for reader mail comes from Hudas, Hudas says: Using your Vita, what's up Colin and Greg, longtime fan question - how often do you find yourself playing your Vita per week? Greg always mentions that he saves games he's excited for to play on the Vita when he travels, Volume XCOM other Cross-Border titles. Colin has talked about dabbling in Saturday morning RPGs and boy is Blob I have been a longtime V owner since 2012 but I find myself not playing nearly as much over the last year and prefer spending my time in gaming experiences on the PlayStation 4 big screen since you no longer commute to work, how often do you turn your V on at home to play it?

I would say, and it's a week, and and it is contingent a little bit on travel, but sometimes it isn't. For instance, when Persona 4: Dancing All Night and Yo-kai Watch came out, I played the **** out of both of those games in my bed, and we weren't traveling at that time. Um, even when another episode came out, I played that in my bed on a Saturday morning. RPGs I play in my bed. I actually feel like Vita when I played it as a boy in his blob, I was in San Diego but I was playing it in San Diego not even on the trip, I was just playing it. Yeah, so um my Vita is always that thing that's like kind of the comfort it's like why we have cable television it's cuz like we know we like to know it's there yeah and so I bring my Vita with me but half the time I'm traveling on like I don't even touch it at all like actually probably more than half the time I",

I feel like, I feel like when I played this game what I found was it was fluid and it was fast um, the 2.5D kind of stuff's a little disconcerting um, the difficulty is low uh which is which is disappointing especially by Strider standards but I really found this to be a very unique and very um uh heartfelt reimagining of what Strider could be and uh I felt like people people liked it it was like it was like considered like okay or good but",

I thought and thought while I went to go get pizza for dinner in desperation, I settled on the name of the pizza place in my town and ended up with Papa John's 1706. Oh my God, Papa John's 1706 - that's awful! Now, while this isn't a particularly bad name, it has led to a lot of annoyance over the years as my name is Nathan, and people online always call me John even though people I know in real life have made jokes about how I must be fat. I no longer play online as it's just easier to play alone than to explain my story. Please, let us change our names - Nathan (not John). Papa John's 1706? Yeah, that's pretty bad!
