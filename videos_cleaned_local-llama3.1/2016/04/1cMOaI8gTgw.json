I tell myself that it's impossible to completely bury feelings for someone, but am I being dishonest with my current partner by still harboring these feelings? No, that's what Facebook is for. Am I wrong? No... I look, I think what you're suffering from right now is what we call in the trade as the \"grass is always greener on the other side\" syndrome. Um, there's always going to be a little bit of wonder because there are always options in life, but what it means to be a man is you have to actually just commit and devote yourself to this relationship, which it sounds like you're doing, which is fantastic. Yeah, I think the best part is that like you're happy, you know? It's not like you're wondering, \"Oh, like I'm happy now, and like there's something out there could it be better?\" It's like no, I'm happy; I'm just kind of wondering what's",
