Well, I have cause every time you played it when we've played it, we're like, \"The controls suck on this.\" Yeah, you kept saying, \"Well, there has to be a way to turn it off.\" That's the thing: is there a way to turn off this gyroscope stuff? And I have to be able to just play a Star Fox game and you can't. No matter how many people have told me over the last six months that like, \"Oh, Nintendo confirmed you can turn it off.\" There is an option to turn it off, but it doesn't really turn it off. It only turns it off when you're not charging a laser, which in Star Fox, you're constantly charging lasers. That's not even my biggest problem with this game. My biggest problem with this game is that the thing with the gyro controls is they're horrible; they're absolutely horrible.

But this is like no, this is only at this point, it's done and I just wish they didn't use Star Fox to do it because I think this might be the death of the franchise and I think that it's such a special franchise with such special characters and special gameplay that is unlike anything else that Nintendo provides and unlike anything else most other like devs do.

But a beloved one. It was a bit of a berate game that they treated like it was an A-rate game. And I always appreciated that, where they created this world and it was fun and okay, the whole game took you two hours, but those two hours were fun and you wanted to replay it over and over and over again. The characters were awesome and they meant something, and everything that they didn't say while corny was the fun type of corny, like it felt like a Saturday morning cartoon, and I wanted to know more about these characters when you play as the four main ones, you know them, you know there's such archetypes that are just so like there's the mentor, there's the annoying one, and then there's the kind of like cool friend, that's classic.

I don't know why this game needs to be a remake of that game but worse when that was a couple years ago. And it's very unfortunate because I think this might be the death knell for the franchise, and I don't see Nintendo going back because people are gonna be upset about this. And then also comes from the pack in that Star Fox Guard, which to me is almost an insult. The game's not bad; Guard is a fun little diversion, isn't it? It's a do you remember years ago when they first talked about the Wii U there was a demo called like Giant Metal Robots I think it was, and it looks like a bunch of security cameras on the GamePad or a new cycle or on the screen, and then you cycle through, and it's like",

They would have just stopped; they would have made Star Fox 64 instead, like we're not well-versed in the series. I know I wouldn't go that far because I like to play Salt and Sanctuary too, but that's a different story. But with this game, I wish it didn't exist. I wish that again because I think this is gonna kill everything, and that sucks because there's so much potential with it, but it's not like they can be killed; our Fox isn't dead. I mean, the GameCube had its own barrel roll thing, like it's an established thing, whether it was ever a triple-A game or not, right?
