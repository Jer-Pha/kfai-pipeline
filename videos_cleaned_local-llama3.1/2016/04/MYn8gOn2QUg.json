Oh, you know that the Wii U gamepad was a huge critical and commercial success. It has buttons, Greg. I know, but it has a screen that everybody loves, that's what you really use all the games using that touch screen. I hate you so much, and it was only one touch. I hope this is only one touch as well. You have two control sticks and one big button; you just tap on it. Oh man, I mean, it's this is really kind of disheartening to me because it... this looks bad. This do you have any hope for this controller if this is the controller? I have no hope.

That's true, but these are the people who made the Wii U and did all that stuff, so... or and the Wii, which didn't do that, you know? Like that again, we were talking about VR a couple weeks ago, like what Nintendo never came through on the promise of what the Wii could do. What are you talking about? Like what, 100 million units worldwide, the promise? But we're talking about the games though; we're talking about real games. There were... and I love the Wii, I personally love the Wii.

That would mean those are better than some of these records that sell and go gold or silver. So I don't like we talked about this morning on Colin Moriarty's live stream about Batman vs Superman, about everyone judging it by its merits based on how much money it makes. I'm like, who cares how much money it makes? People are going to see it anyway. Is it good or is it bad? Mhm. Nintendo makes unintuitive and shitty decisions, and they have since the N64. I mean we talk a lot about the things that they did pioneer that didn't make sense - the d-pad, shoulder buttons, Rumble. I mean these things did stick around, but then you had them making a console that was cartridge based when it was obviously a bad idea. Then you had to make a console with the little mini CDs and minis.",

I think practice, practice, practice is key. Practice reading if you want to host on camera; grab a magazine or a book and just read it out loud, and like practice reading it in different ways and figuring out why it sounds different. And just little things like that are super important. And now with the way online digital media is, you can use your webcam or even your cell phone to do vlogs, you know?

I don't know if I've told you about this couple times', I was super hyped there are a lot of Let's Plays here on youtube.com/kindafunnygames so wave four just came out, wave five is in May but that's all we know okay, so I wanted to grab somebody over at TT Games, hug him tight thank him for making the game and then ask him what the **** comes next.

Thank you so much for making it. No, no, it was it was our pleasure. I mean that that's the key, it was always going to be a game about fan service. I mean we're fans, that that's the key to everything we do. We love these properties, we we love Ghostbusters and Superman and we grew up with them like Doctor Who. I I grew up watching Doctor Who, so to actually get to make a game about playing around in that world is an incredible honor, and it was just so much fun. I mean you know you say you work on a game well this didn't actually feel like work at all it was fun from day one till we put it on the shelves and it continues to be fun for us to work on and that's what I want to talk a bit about with I mean because I've talked about the game people have seen",

Bez 87 has a really long question that I'm just going to kind of boil down: Hello best friends, my question is when are we going to see the death of in-game loading? I feel like in this day and age it shouldn't be an issue anymore, but playing Bloodborne there's a lot of loading. GTA got it right by loading the game at the start, but then there's still a lot more blah blah blah one's loading going away never yeah that's just how games work.",

Yeah so I think like yeah it's a simple question, the thing about it is like is you know load exists because of how big the game is right and how competent the machine is is but when the machine gets better the games get bigger that's the whole thing you're not going to ever see it go away because they're always going to be chasing each other yeah yeah I think it's just about hiding it properly and and not you know like Bloodborne's a great example, I know that they patched it and made it better but when Bloodborne came out the load times in Bloodborne were absurd like it wasn't even long or like I was like you could literally go take a shower",

Yeah, a game like that was really a letdown for what I thought was a pretty great game. I was like, that's insane - I mean, I couldn't believe the load times in that so it is unimmersive. Rise of the Tomb Raider did really well; their loads were quick if you died, you instantly were right back in it. Mhm. So back in the day, like before CD games and all the cart-based stuff, there was no loading at all - right? Was there any cart game that had loading?

Um is that there's just not that many people anymore that can do it and do it well so like do it up to that level because there's a lot of like pixel art 8 bit or 16 bit inspired or even 32-bit inspired games out there that do pixel art not very well. Um so he was saying to me that like one of the big problems in why Bloodborne is 2.5D and why Nioh is 2.5D, which is not an EG game but similar reason is that it's just really expensive because you have to find people that can do it properly and it's a dying art um and so these people can demand money and and it takes a lot of time and it might not be worth it I'm super disappointed that Bloodborne or Nioh, or both 2.5D but if they do that because it is just cheaper to make a model that you can then program to animate um without having to do it literally frame by frame so um that's kind of a nutshell kind of",
