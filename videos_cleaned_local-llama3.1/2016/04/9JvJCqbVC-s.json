            "text": "Hey everyone it's Nick uh I wanted to give you a quick update for what's happening with The Animated Series. Obviously uh we're working very very hard on episode 4, but we are slipping behind a little bit. Originally the goal was to hit one episode a month, but we've listened to your feedback - we're trying to make them a little longer, we're trying to make them a little more complex and introduce some of our friends as guests, and that's kind of slowing us down a little bit. Um so I apologize for that. The episode is coming; it should be here next week uh Dean is working his ass off um but he needs a little bit of help. So if you guys have noticed we've actually started doing some outreach uh to bring on some more animators. We've got two more animators on the hook, but I still want to get more people on if we can to help out with this series. So if you guys have any experience in Flash or you know anyone that does, shoot them over to KindaFunny.com submit um we'll take a look at their resume.",
