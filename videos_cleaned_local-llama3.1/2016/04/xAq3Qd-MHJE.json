This is gonna double back like I was saying the last topic to let me say in that topic all these things what is this state of video games journalism? You said something very interesting in the last topic. Okay, that that was the first time you really felt like a journalist, like ya doing something yeah and then you but you work news you made a reference to this game comes out on this day this way. Where are we right now do you think our wood is is there games journalism happening what does it all look like? There will always be a place for the the news right like the the act of a publisher making something and wanting the world to know about it whether it's on their own sites or through the press will exist for a long time yeah they will always need to get that information to communicate that information to the player you will.",

You will always want people to know your games are coming out, that you have a cool actor associated with it, that you've got cool plans that you're gonna have demo at PAX, whatever that stuff will always be there. It's not the most fun stuff in the world to write but it's necessary and people are excited about it so you do it. It's also like a gateway to bigger things where it's like, \"Oh, we know this thing about this game now, we can write an opinion piece or feature follow-up interview, whatever.\" Like that is a gateway to do more with something. Sure, but there's also like actual amazing awesome journalism in the industry right now and I think Kotaku is doing the absolute best of it in the entire industry. Jason Schreier (not Trier Patrick) and Patrick Klepek are amazing, yeah, they're good job those guys do such different work than anybody else",

And I think it is the list gets pretty short. Warm intelligent ah Patrick know where to start talking about. And it's like there's people out there doing it but the journalism is there in such a fashion where it is like you what your time. But like all right cool this characters in the game, this is the DLC package, this is a release date, whatever. I'll put up that story and then I'll think about features about I think about interviews. But most people are just like here it is, you know what I mean.

But it's not until you start doing original work, whether that's like an opinion piece or a feature or whatever, something critical, something different, that you and your website's voice starts to stand out as distinct. Yeah, and the best websites are the ones that do that. Obviously, it's like if you have a perspective that is different than the publishers now you have an interesting thought and you can say something crazy like Colin might or you might say something super super intelligent or astute that like nobody else is thinking about, you might compare somebody's business strategy to something else that does or doesn't work and you can weigh all these things against each other to form an",

But, and it's also not just gonna be like today JJ Abrams said the flick is sure, that's not interesting.
