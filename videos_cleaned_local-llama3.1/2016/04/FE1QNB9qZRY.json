And here's the setup for the story: I walked into my Starbucks two days in a row and they're doing this stupid thing now where you can order ahead and people, it's awesome, don't get me wrong, and I should get on this bandwagon, but I have not yet, and it bit me in the ass twice because I walked in and there's five people in line. I'm like, \"Dope, there's only five people in line.\" It was the day that I had to get you the Cherry yogurt and you didn't get it inside, and I was like, \"Oh great, I got Greg wanted some cherry yogurt; I'm going to get to the house by 10:30; he'll eat it; he won't be angry at me; it's going to be fine; he won't take it out on Colin; it's going to be great.\" And I looked down and as you know they always do the thing where they're writing your name, like \"What's your name, Nick? Nick, how do you\"",

There's always a new guy being trained because the Starbucks I go to is like hell on Earth, it's the one that like breaks people. It's the Vietnam of Starbucks, right? And so like they always are just dropping people left and right, so no one knows how to do anything with slow lines, that right? One the nicest Starbucks in the city? No, it's not because it's like the bum Starbucks now there's a lot of like homeless people around you. The one in the marina, yeah, the one in the marina it's pretty bad but it's also it's also just not set up for that volume of people it's a high volume of Starbucks so I go and I'm like they write my coffee down I'm good I got all the snacks them that Greg asked me to get ready to rock",

I got it; I got it metered out of my watch. I'm like okay, 9 minutes; I'll be right back now. I'm seeing other people do this by the way. People are dropping like flies; one woman was just like \"it\" and left, and I didn't see her come back, and trust me, I would have seen her come back because I was there for 30 minutes waiting for an iced coffee, which finally...

We're on that level.

No. Think if they were, I would have been like, \"Scoop you; you should've been like, 'I'm taking my coffee; I'm never coming back.'\" And now, have you thought about just getting on board with mobile ordering?
