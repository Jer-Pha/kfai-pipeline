            "text": "Beacon of inside sources Colin, this topic is all about them. We got two questions kind of from different angles about it. Sure, question one comes from NextGen Matt. He says, \"Hey guys, was wondering if you could explain inside sources in the gaming industry when the NX rumors were dropped by Eurogamer, IGN, and Kotaku confirmed the rumors with their insider sources.\" I assume this is either someone in Nintendo or a game developer or a retail partner of Nintendo that has information on the NX who confirm these rumors. What I don't understand is why would they confirm this? Why wish their relationship with Nintendo? What do they have to gain by confirming or supplying information? I understand writers being told information off the record, but I don't understand why someone with access to major developers or platform holders would release this information and allow journalists to publish it anonymously. Also, why would you remain a single outlet's go-to for confirming leaks? Why maintain that",

Reaching out for comments, Stu, like that my my whole thing is I and I don't know if Greg has a different insight into it, I don't know, like I, I really don't know, like I think some people just just want you know I I think that some people might maybe get a little bit of satisfaction being like that's like in their own heart in their own mind like that's me like that broke because of me or whatever you know I don't know I don't I don't know. So I thought the question was going on why an unnamed Source, in general, why would some read it to me again let me see it you're saying why would an unnamed Source but he asked why would some when why there be a confirmation or whatever no he's saying why would an unnam'd source with actual connections to these industries.",

When NX rumors were dropped by Eurogamer IG and Kitaku I'm sorry yeah by Eurogamer IG and Kitaku confirmed rumors with their insider sources. I assume this is either someone at Nintendo or a game developer retail partner Nintendo who has information on the NX who confirmed these rumors that for so right there, for that one part, that's calling your friends who work in the video game industry and being like hey did you see what Eurogamer just put up is that true? And that's that second thing that Colin was talking about, so I'm just making sure I'm just saying it's all one bugger right now I'm trying to clear it all up, so for that though, like so you know you hear pretend you're you're at IGN right",

So I don't know the answer to that question other than the fact that like you know one thing that bothers me and I think Greg can speak to this more because I know that um journalistic standards are varied depending on what you're talking about but it's funny you bring this up because today I was going back and reading an old story from Kotaku about how they were blacklisted from Polygon or Polygon blacklisted from Bethesda and blacklisted from Ubisoft for",

We don't have to draw the line of being or trying to be you know, like in terms of news or news coverage or coverage in general, trying to be objective on that front anymore. We don't want to be dicks. These are thought-provoking questions and I think they're salient questions and important questions. But I I want to make a comparison to politics now. I understand that politics is way more important in a way more real world right. Political campaigns craft a message, they often make they often leak things intentionally all the time, which I'm not entirely convinced publishers don't do either.
