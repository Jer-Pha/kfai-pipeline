Besides that, another interesting thing too was like okay, besides the you know the combat fighting other people and fighting other mechs, what else do we have going on for us with single player? And the cool thing was interesting enough, there's puzzles right - they used Titanfall's great mechanics when it comes to movement and applied that to single player in a way that I just didn't think of in my mind. That was like, puzzles. So there's different encounters where you'd have to set up these different types of of puzzles in terms of like jumping around and making sure you don't hit electricity and wall running at the proper time etc etc. And all these things started to click for me, and all these things made me care about single player for Titanfall 2. Not to mention the game just looked gorgeous for single player, which you know I kind of expected that coming",
