We just so happen to be at the Denver, Colorado Road to PlayStation event and I'm very excited. How are you? Pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. I'm good, thank you for having me. It sounds like they're pumping in noise like they do at Broncos games. It's funny. And you wonder why Colin doesn't come to more events. Over there, the pure one, Tim Gettys. Let Tim host. Thank you. Thank you Tim for joining us. This is what your second PS I Love You XOXO event? Technically third. I did one with Shuhei and then I did the E3 thing. We only bring you out for the biggest shows. I know. So who's familiar with PS I Love You XOXO? I was so clear not to raise your hands and I saw you do it. I saw you raise your hand and you gave me a t-shirt earlier and that doesn't mean you get away with raising your hands. If you're allowed to say you're sorry, I'll accept that apology.

Do you know why the disco ball is there, Colin? In this particular venue? Yeah. No? Because last night there was a Pok\u00e9mon themed roller derby where they would... Oh no! That's awesome. No!

If you're listening to MP3, or I guess if Kevin hasn't spun around to the back, what's happening with the Road to Greatness is that PlayStation's traveling the entire continental United States with its truck showing off cool games. It just so happens that a duo named Brian and Aaron sent in an awesome video to get them off the beaten path to bring them to Denver, Colorado to give you this exclusive event. So in the back there's a whole bunch of PlayStation VR units. People have been playing PlayStation 4. PlayStation Vue is over here. No one seems that interested in it because it's PlayStation Vue.

They have Resident Evil here. I haven't done the Resident Evil E3 demo. It's scary. I've heard that. I did the kitchen demo way back in the day and then they got Batman: Arkham VR which was my E3 game of the show.

So Colin, we've been apart a long time, a whole week. Not long enough some might say. How many PlayStation games have you played? A lot. A baker's dozen! Oh Jesus. I didn't expect that. I was very naive. This is the special episode. I need to give the people what they want, the cheap pops. You know, I've been playing, I was messing around with No Man's Sky and I'm just like nah.

And I was like this seems like something I might like but I'm not giving enough time. By Saturday night I was packing and I'm like do I pack the PlayStation? Am I going to be that guy that brings the PlayStation and then like after things I don't go I just go back to the hotel room and play stuff. And then I was like do I bring the PlayStation and my game screen and plug it in on Virgin America and play on the plane? That's so dangerous dude because the power goes in and out.

Good job. Did I click for you? No, I mean I only put a few hours into it but it was actually, I was talking to a few people when we were just hanging out that it was when I was showing the game to Erin and she was like, and I realized I was explaining it and I'm like oh my God like I don't think this game's for me.

No. I can't stop. I can't quit you Downwell. You know like, it's just, I was on the plane this morning coming from San Francisco and I was just looking at my Vita. I put it in the pocket on Virgin America. Oh yeah. It's a perfectly sized Vita pocket. By the way, I bought a pair of cheap headphones this morning.

But I was staring at the Vita and Downwell was there and I was like, you know, I got to keep going. I'm just, I'm not getting any better at it.

No, Sunflowers is great. Everybody should pick up Sunflowers. What is Sunflower? It's a very simple kind of like... It's an iOS port. Yeah, it's kind of an iOS port of a... You have like six seeds on the ground and then you water them with clouds but there's like lightning. Well it's a very straightforward kind of game. You're collecting flowers.

I didn't want to win like that. I'd rather lose with dignity. That's the opposite of curiosity. Did the Americans cheat when they won hockey in 1980 or four or whenever they did that? It was 1980 and no I don't think that they cheated. Exactly. It was just good strategy Colin. Did G.I. Joe cheat every time they beat Cobra? No. Cobra cheated a lot though. They outsmarted him. Yeah.

So you need to run, get the onion, chop it up, put it in the pot, get another onion, chop it up, put it in the pot, another one, put it in the pot, put it on a plate, deliver it to the waiter and then they bring it out to the people.

I don't even know anything about Bound. It's the new Plastic game, so Plastic are the guys at the Polish demo scene studio. They don't really make games.

Did anyone play I Am Setsuna? Oh my god, I'm so disappointed in you guys. One guy in the back really played it.

So ladies and gentlemen, the only reason you're here right now watching the show, playing these games is because of Brian and Aaron. Please put your hands together and welcome them to the stage. Take a way bigger bow than that. This is all because of you. Standing ovation ladies and gentlemen. Please sit down. You're going to lick the microphone. As somebody who licked a PlayStation Vita 83, bad idea. Don't do that. A lot of germs on it. It's working. Yeah we're good. You here. How you doing Aaron? I'm good how are you doing? I'm great.

Do you hear about it through the blog, PlayStation blog Sid Schuman and then decide to get into it or how does it go? Yeah I saw it on the PlayStation blog. It's a website I hit up about every day.

You're having a bad first date and then it's like, \"But how many trophies do you have?\" - and the light goes off.

I actually think it's a lot like the release of Destiny where Destiny was so hyped up and it is a fantastic shooter but those first three months were rough in Destiny. They were really rough. I mean the mechanics were there but the content wasn't. And the content rolls out and now we're coming into year three and it's fantastic. And I think No Man's Sky probably has the same potential to hit that stride but as of right now it feels like there was a lot of content promised that might be impossible to deliver on day one, honestly.

I'm afraid of like a chilling effect with other developers being like well we shouldn't be bold and ambitious. You just want a military shooter. You just want a side scrolling old school pixelated game. And that's fine but it's like I just don't understand the mean spiritedness about this particular game.

I still feel like in spirit. They're they're inherently predatory A game should cost money and you should pay for it.
