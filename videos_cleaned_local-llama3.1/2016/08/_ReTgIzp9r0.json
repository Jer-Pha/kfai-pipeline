So here's the thing: we know it is happening on September 7th, 3 p.m. Eastern Time. Right? Right? We know that it's going to be about the PlayStation Neo. You don't know that whatever. We know that PlayStation VR is it going to be more than that. I think so. So let's let's what do you think it is call uh there are some rumors that there might be a slim PS4 there as well. I I don't know if that's true or not based on some some patents and stuff like that that have been leaking out, that people were actually thinking maybe it was a new Vita. And we got excited for the Vita. Um I think they're going to show the Neo. I I obviously and there and what I'm most interested to see is the pricing, the specs, it's like it is.",

Final Dev kits will release around September 7th reveal, so they're not even out yet. So there is a chance they've been right now. There's an important caveat there, and this is something Greg and I talked about as well, although we don't know what it means: the dev kits are going out, but when you spec games on PC to what they say the console is going to run at, so people are already working definitively working on Neo games. Remember the rumor was that by the end of September any game coming out had to or what any game starting in October and any game releasing in September had it be patched right? That was the old rumor, and my assumption is that the it could be a red herring with like well the the the kits are going out therefore for.",

Um, and it would be kind of a cool thing to be like it's really the same; it's just a little more powerful. You want to be able to tell your friends you have, but actually one of the things happened today with Hello Games coming out and saying No Man's Sky will change the nature of their game. I'm like, see, you know? I'm like now you're creating halves and haves; not I didn't see that what they say uh that will just allow them to create a bold or more ambitious game.

This is exactly what I was talking about - this is going to happen for a lot of games now, and this is going to create controversy and problems for Sony. So they have to have a marketing approach to this and a PR approach to this too, to put out these fires. Because now we're going to see games running on this console, and so are we going to see how the games gonna look on the old console? If No Man's Sky is going to be better on Neo, isn't that against the whole preface of a ubiquitous platform? Why I even have a PlayStation 4 at that point. Shawn says, \"For our game, No Man's Sky is procedurally generated.\" So more power for hardware doesn't just mean upgraded textures and high frame rate; it means we can fundamentally change the experience you can have - and you'll see this from our patches.

You'll see this from our patch notes - we're able to change huge things in the universe because we have complete control with more powerful Hardware. We can have more trees, more leaves on those trees, the density or immersion of Worlds, or new types of Worlds could exist. So when you like that's the problem is when you're talking about this fundamentally changing leaves and trees - cool. But then the last part of the new types of Worlds - that's where it gets into it. Because the rest of that does just sound like PC slider stuff. Sure, shaders and all that... yeah, it's just more complicated than that though. These games - this is I'm super interested.

Like that's it's a big lift, it's a heavy lift for a company that doesn't really have that much money. For I think they've tinkered with it, I don't I don't and I don't know what that would mean but I think something has to have changed from when this originally was what it was. And I think that it's a direct reaction to everything we've heard about. I was reading on NeoGAF a lot of people think that what this could mean is things like overclocking, like they figured out ways to just kind of change the clock speed on stuff to to kind of just be able to boost the specs that they throw out there and like put on the box you know um because people hear the six Teraflops or whatever it is for",

It's like, if you want it, if consumers want to find an older one, they can find an older one. Like, that's you need to when you're making changes like this, you kind of have to stand behind them or else... The more I feel like this is the type of thing you need to commit to. You can't kind of foot around it and just be like, \"Here, if you want the old one, it's cheaper now.\" Because that's like, unless they're just trying to get rid of the stock that they have, and then that totally makes sense. Yeah, they need to commit to this and they need to be like, \"It is what it is.\" Your games, if you already have a PlayStation 4, it's going to be fine.

This holiday, yeah. And and and I've said, I've said in the past, I think I said it on the show, but I've definitely said on PS I Love You is that I didn't believe the rumors about Red Dead supposed to be at was was supposed to be the Stinger at at E3 Sony's E3 conference until I heard it from people I trust. Like I heard it from people that I absolutely trust so they're not wrong about anything else, I don't know why they'd be wrong about this. So something happened there, I think and so yeah it's possible that they they owed this um you know they could have they could have pulled it in light of the Orlando shooting and stuff like that because I'm sure it's a very\"",

If it's just uh like why not just have the event be about the PlayStation um slim you know, like just what's their Xbox One S frankly version could be but I don't I don't I don't think that'd be the best troll all time they would never. We're shipping the PlayStation 4, it's it's 10 it's $50 cheaper that's it see you guys.
