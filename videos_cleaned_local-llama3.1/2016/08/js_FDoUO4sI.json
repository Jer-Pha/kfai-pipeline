Let me know how you're feeling, Greg. Man, how am I feeling? Tim, it's just this is the one I thought had the chance that it had the chance, you know what I mean? I know Batman v Superman; we're not going to retread all this stuff. An acquired taste maybe. I like not allowing you to say that people like it. Yes, people do like that movie. I'm not alone in liking it. People like this movie too, Greg. Not they won't though, that's the thing. They won't like this movie. All right, yes, people right now are saying they enjoy this movie so... I don't know, I don't know, I I don't know. Uh, if you ever watched a Kinda Funny Vids SpoilerCast thing when we do for these things for the spoiler, the first part's is uh spoiler-free so it's spoiler-free here in the beginning and when we we're going to go spoil the movie we'll get into spoilers.

And then as it started to get worse, I was like wait a second, this is getting bad. But I enjoyed those moments and I was like wait, what did I laugh at though? I don't even remember what I laughed at. And then I started thinking about it in the context of we just saw Ghostbusters two weeks ago or three weeks ago, whatever right. And I think Ghostbusters is a better movie than this movie; I enjoyed myself more at Ghostbusters than I did at Suicide Squad.

This is... I'm enjoying these characters,\" and then it was the action, and it was the same thing here, where the first third of Suicide Squad, I was like, \"All right, cool.

Bring in Task Force X. Bring them all together.\" All these people who literally they've asked once to be in this, and like El Diablo's like no, and everybody else is like, I don't know what the **** happening.

Like make it just more about them having an antagonist that they're facing, and I feel like we could have gotten to know those characters and enjoyed them a lot more instead of just having a bunch of characters.
