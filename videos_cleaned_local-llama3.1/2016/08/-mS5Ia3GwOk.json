Yeah, I was just staring blankly like alright. Once again, this is what Kevin's doing right, playing with a serious blade with this. I don't envy Kevin's job, but I also know that he could do it better; where it's just like he said to the show, but he's always building something or is that what it's called? Do you remember, Kevin, you weren't any some prosper when you're here in a second?

So inside the NX is stated above the system will harness and video's powerful mobile processor Tegra. Graphical comparisons with current consoles are difficult due to the vastly different nature of the device once again we've heard Nintendo is not chasing graphical parity quite the opposite it's sacrificing power to ensure it can squeeze all this technology into a handheld something which also tallies earlier tallies with earlier reports so will be less powerful than the PS4.

And I'm super interested as well to see how people react to it because everything I've been or not everything but a lot of what I've been seeing is largely negative. So Nintendo's certainly working against that negative wave although I don't really see what's there to be negative about because we don't know enough to really be negative about it yet.

And like I know we are gamers, we're competing with PlayStation, we're competing with Xbox, and we're going head-to-head, and we're gonna do this and this right now is a clear definition that they aren't, and again that's what's exciting about it for me. If it was just another \"all right, cool\" - I mean eventually I'd pick it up for Mario Kart or for Mario or for Zelda, all that. But the idea of...

We don't know if this is correct, but yeah, going off of it, duh, if this is correct, that means that that Zelda game is playable wherever you want portably; then you can take it to your house or to any one hotel or whatever connect and play it, that's crazy.

What's your issue with the new 3D? Yes, what would be the new three? I'm talking about all the clamshell models are flimsy, they're just pieces of junk, they need to do better than that.

You would think the sweet spots $299, but this thing sounds if everything's you know it's gonna have a nice battery in it. It's gonna have to have a nice screen.
