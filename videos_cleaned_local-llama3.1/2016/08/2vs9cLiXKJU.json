It's going to be fun. Start with Abzu. Abzu, cuz my God, yeah that game looks like a game it's taken it it's taken the world by storm this AB it's not hit the Pok\u00e9mon go world threshold but okay our industry it's taken Marty S by no and Mitch Dyer and Katsuragi Blazinski everyone's out there tweeting and talking and reviewing Abzu talking about it. I just played it, I just beat it, yeah, okay that was something I did for two hours so let's give a little bit of a background on Abz\u00fb. Abz\u00fb not made by that game company despite the similarities had it's game made by Giant Squid this is their first game the the leader of Giant Squid left that game there you go you got some you got some of that",

There you go, you got some, you got some of that stuff there. The art director for Flower and Journey, right, AKA two of my favorite games of all time, yeah. Leaving here to do this correct also Austin Wintory, composer of Journey; yep, composer of this game. Look at you with your facts, and that took me two minutes of watching you play for me to be like, \"This is a game for me.\" This looks awesome, and that's the whole thing about it is what I want to as we get into this: what do I think? You should play Abzu, of course. I'm not going to make it spoiler-free; uh, should you play Abzu? Of course, you should play Abzu. It's another one of those games \u2013 our Gamescast are art \u2013 and here's this thing like my it's it's similar to my Inside thing when we did the review of Inside where it's just like it's a really abstract, you know what I mean",

I get why people love it; it is beautiful, oh my God, is it a beautiful game every time. And like that's the one thing that's for me. The best part of the game is like at any point I felt like I could put the controller down and look back or go into meditate. Meditating because that's like one of the big things where you see these like uh shark statues that you go and you rest on their heads and you meditate, and then the camera just kind of spins around. Let's see it always looks like a moving painting, it's always beautiful, like the colors, whether they're using a very very dark palette, you know when you're underwater it's it's dank and it's gross or you're this bright beautiful it's tropical it's a coral reef, awesome stuff there, awesome, awesome color really.",

I feel like that's even a totally even other topic where it's like sure uh and even Tom about Inside before there was that question of like all right so what and whatever but it's like if that's the point then that's the point.

You're talking about the the it looks like every frame looks like a painting, yeah. Like I think that uh they they did that to an extent with Flower but then Journey knocked it out of the park where it's just like every single shot of that looks amazing. It doesn't and it's PS3 doesn't matter, PS1 can be out and that's going to look amazing because of the art direction and I think that this is another one of those moments where the art direction of uh Matt Nava he gets it, you know, he gets how to design something to evoke emotion uh just just from the look of it right. Look just watching you play it's like I get the feelings of of Journey and of Flower but like this also had its own own thing to it.

And it, but that is uh that's the art to me, that is that is the thing that is hard com yeah it's hard to kind of like bring it's not so much the what does it stand for and what is the metaphor of this the art of it is the melding of that stuff in a in a very um emotional experience that is driven by you controlling it. Sure, and it's weird because it's not that far off from the Mario Maker uh levels that people make that are just you hit right once and then it or just hold right and run and it like plays through the whole level for you um or or you know people always talk about certain games like um I mean even Journey is like oh you just hold if you just hold",

It's like Sonic the Hedgehog - that's probably a really good way to bring this up in terms of everyone being like \"oh, you can just go fast and hold right and jump\" - it's like no, that's not how that works. The first couple levels of Sonic are actually more about the physics of it and using ramps to get better at playing the same level over and over so you can understand how to just bounce through it super fast. And I think there's that same level of like, playing Flower reminded me of playing Sonic 2 in Chemical Plant Zone when you're going through... you know, I'm talking about Chemical Plant - it's the one with the purple",

It's one of the most iconic Sonic levels. Um, being little, I remembering that and anding overwhelmed with a sense of ed and sensation of movement and I'm causing this to do things even though most of it was getting from point A to point B to trigger what's essentially a quick quick time event but I think these games make me feel that way even watching you play made me feel like there's a sense of momentum and when you add the music to that swelling, like that's where the emotion comes from. It's momentum mixed with um this this auditory visual feedback combination that it's just like moment momentum is a great way to describe I think Abzu and where I think people keep talking about how relaxing the game is I think that's true but it's also in the way of at no point in this game was I",

I think that's true in part, but it's also because at no point in this game was I up against an impossible moment right off the bat. There was no inside moment like \"wait, what do I need to do?\" even like Journey, because there were times in Journey where I remember feeling uncertain about something, trying to figure out if this is what I'm supposed to do or not. It's very obvious what the next thing is. So if it is that you want to go explore, if you want to touch every fish and grab on and ride them and do these different things, unlock them all, meditate everywhere, if you want to go collect seashells, if you want to go do all that, you can, and you'll never feel like you've grounded the pace of the game too much. Nor will you ever hit a puzzle so hard that you're like \"what the hell do I do next?\" Yeah, that's cool, I think.",

It's funny because like Mitch today on Twitter was talking about a day one removed and I'm still thinking of Abzu. I'm like, I don't think I'm ever going to think about this game again outside of this conversation. Not that that's a bad thing, not that I'm saying the game's bad. Just in the fact of... like, cool. I'm kind of interested to know what was going on there. But I think I kind of get it, in the same breath and just in the end. But like, what was I doing in the end really? But whatever.

Now see that's interesting and I I guess again having not played it I'd be interested to see if anyone ever brings this up uh in the same conversation with Journey in the way that I've heard Limbo and Inside compared. Interesting where people have differing tastes and neither is right or wrong. It's like I can understand the arguments on both sides for this, like yeah Journey is such a masterpiece because it did nail all of these pieces where it sounds like this one at least in your it's not nailing all of those things and that's hard to do you know?

The guy who worked on Journey left founded a studio made this game and released it before we've ever seen anything from that game.

He's like, \"There's so much pressure.\" You know what I mean, to follow Journey to do this right? Like we've started and stopped a bunch of different projects, and what we're working on now, we're still working on. That's why we're not talking about it.
