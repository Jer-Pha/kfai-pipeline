This is Vince Ingenito filling in for Greg Miller today who's off doing something. Vince from IGN.com. IGN.com. You want to give a high five? Just very softly like that. No, that's it. That's enough. No, that's enough. No more. I wanted I wanted the clasp, but he wouldn't give it to me. All right. I want I want the And then Oh, that's kind of hot. It is. My dick moved like just a little bit. Minor dick movement. Uh, welcome to the show. Uh, you guys were asking for different kinds of guests as we could rotate them in when Greg and I or I aren't here. Um, and so we have Vince here. Now, I do apologize to the fan bases. We said like a week or two ago, we did something like 40 something consecutive episodes with neither of us being gone.

I'm like, \"Oh man, I'll hold it up for everybody.\" Uh, but Vince, thank you for taking the time to be with us here today. We have things to talk about, some big news. Uh before we get into that, uh a few things. First of all, Greg's looking sharp today in the corner on his white chair. I wanted to let everyone know that he's usually not here for the show, but because we're using uh our old janky kind of soundboard. Basically, we've moved everything over to the new studio. And by the way, the new studio is fantastic. So, so we announced that we are going to do a 12-hour live stream on Monday, August 22nd, uh from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Pacific time.

Kevin and Nick have done an extraordinary job over there getting everything together. I said this on NeoGAF today when I was just dropping in because someone made a thread about it about our new space where I was like, you know, a threat or a threat. A threat. Well, remove the D and the T and mix them around. It's probably the same thing. Someone was saying uh well I was basically saying we have no business being in a space that cool.

Yep. You're shutting it down. I'm closing the joint. Your bad your bad news and your bad luck. So, uh, so we're sad to say goodbye to the space, but we're excited to say hello to the new much bigger, much more, I would say, prolific space that will allow us to grow. Greg always uses the, uh, the analogy, uh, that the turtle can only grow as big as the aquarium that he's in. And I think it's actually a really good analogy.

Number one, it looks like Sony is ready to reveal the next iteration of the PlayStation 4, code-named PS4 Neo. Both Greg and I were sent invitations, and I'm sure Vince will do to the so-called PlayStation meeting in New York City at the PlayStation Theater on September 7th. Nothing else is known about the event, including on uh on what will be shown, revealed, and discussed, but we do know it will be streaming, and Greg and I will likely be foregoing being there in person, so we can do pre and post shows for the stream presumably on twitch.tv/confunnamemes, maybe put on VOD later on YouTube.

But uh yeah, no, I I really wanted to go. It's uh it's interesting to me, you know, I think they needed to do this. I feel like they they I think they might have been caught a little bit off guard by how powerful Scorpio is purported to be when Microsoft talked about it at their press conference cuz um I said this before and like I guess to a lot of people it might not mean anything unless you're into PC gaming or you follow these things but like six teraflops which is supposedly the kind of computational power that uh the Scorpio is uh purporting to have is uh that's no",

Um, so I always like to say that even though PS4 is clobbering Xbox One in most metrics, um, it is worth noting Xbox One outsold PS4 last month in North America for the first time in a long time, which I didn't put in the news report because we'll get full NPD probably next week. So, I'm going to wait on that. But, um, I just like to throw that out there that Xbox One isn't necessarily, you know, wallowing in nothingness. It's just by comparison to the PS4. Um, it's certainly not doing as well. But, but we did get a question about this that I wanted to bring up that kind of goes into this. Um, n Hollywood asks, uh, says, \"Congratulations on you guys being invited to the PlayStation meeting in New York City on September 7th. Do you have any expectations going into this event?

And if so, do you think those expectations will be met?\" Uh, my own expectations are simple. I think that they need to just show the console and find a clever way to market this thing in a way that won't make old PS4 fans feel isolated or alienated away from a new fan base that's going to grow with a more powerful hardware. Because I do feel like, as I've said many times, there's going to be some sort of issue, I think, with saying like this is God of War and look how good it looks. Look how good Kratos and his son look and it's running on Neo and everyone's gonna be like, well, what about how does it look on the old PS4? Are they are they going to show side by side images at E3 next year being like this is the game on Neo and this is the game on PS4. They can't do that. And then but of course they can't. So then like there's just",

So then like there's just going to be a lot of questions. Are there going to be is it going to be like better than better on Neo or whatever it's going to be called on on the box. So I just I'm curious about how this goes. I I feel like there's there's not only the the computational problem that you were talking about about how this doesn't seem to be a quantum leap like Scorpio was and I've talked about that on the show. That's why I think Scorpio seems like a much more reasonable machine. Not only because of its power jump, but because it's coming out four years after the console came out as opposed to 3 years, right?

And I think that comes from, you know, there were rumors about this, but nothing solid came through about it. Um, there were rumors about, you know, Sony cooking up some kind of an agreement that all people who wanted to all all companies, third party and obviously first that want to publish a game on their platform are going to need to commit to a regular standard version and a Neo version. Um, and that, you know, you can't tank the you can't make something that's designed to the Neo spec with the idea that it won't run well and operate well at the standard spec.

But they're I think they're they're trying to put something solid in place to make sure that developers don't just shaft existing PS4 owners because that would obviously be terrible for everybody. But like that begs the question then how do they sell developers and publishers on the idea that it's worth their time and money to essentially develop and certify which isn't cheap um two versions of the game. But like I guess my my immediate counterpoint to myself though is that they're already doing that. You know the the PS4 was intentionally made in terms of its architecture to be very similar to a PC for a reason. That's why they can spec their games, developers can spec their games on a PC version and then easily translate, you know, the performance uh or scale it down whatever uh for the console version. So being as",

So being as it may that PC games are already can be made to a whole variety of different specs, developers are kind of already in a situation where they're um where they're making several versions of the game uh if their game is going to be on PC that is. So, it's like if you can put your game on PC, then you can put your game on two different versions of the PS4, assuming that Sony supports it the right way, doesn't make totally uh oppressive rules about it, and then maybe they give people a break on the certification costs. I don't know. I I think the thing I'm expecting and hoping to see more than anything from the from the from the event isn't so much what the box looks like or how powerful it is, but what they're doing to make sure this isn't doom and gloom for developers.

If suddenly you start putting in all kinds of crazy rules and requirements that cost developers time and money, suddenly the PlayStation platform isn't as strong.

I think these are unforced errors, but as we were talking about at lunch, um they might be smart to be ahead of the curve here depending on the the the direction that the gaming industry is going. I think it's just that the console space has to get used to this new reality and I think they're going to very quickly. We got another question. This one's from Ricky who asks um would Sony be crazy enough to stealth release a new PS at the PS meeting on September 7th in New York City.

If the if the drops if this drops the need for proprietary memory cards or supports SD cards, Sony may have a hit on their hands. Much love and adoration, Ricky. No, this rumor I don't know if you saw was percolating last week because there were some patents coming out of Sony that indicated that they were making a mobile device. Um, and it could be maybe a slim down PS Vita or a new PS Vita. Um, I don't know if you want to call it a new PS Vita, new handheld, who the hell knows what it would be called.

Um, the one thing that I think is more likely, Vince, is that and and Greg and I discussed this I think on GamesCast last week, but I think it's I think it's possible is that in addition to revealing the Neo inevitably on September 7th, um, that they will reveal a slim PS4, um, thus being able to precipitously drop the price of the PlayStation 4 and keep maybe Neo at the same price point or just a notch above $350, let's say.

So, you're referring, of course, to the fat PS3 to the 2009 slim model, which was kind of imperative, not only to drop the cost of it, but also from a like a sleekness perspective. Sure. Exactly. They can certainly drop the cost of and and improve the cooling and performance of the PS4 internally without making drastic changes to the footprint though.

Well that at the end of the day we'll have 50 million of them in in the wild and we're not going to stop making games for them. It's just that like this is the console moving forward. This and it's just it's this way. And I think that this became a more possible kind of thing when the the new Xbox S, whatever it's called, Xbox One S is more powerful than the original Xbox One in some like minor way. Yeah.

I just think that the way to make the new one seem more valuable is to precipitously drop the price of the old one.

They sell a bunch of those units, but then they're like, but this other one is it we we're look how even though it might not be true, like look how much more valuable it is.

And the interesting thing the tough thing about it too is that like no matter which way they go, they're going to have to do some spin doctoring to not piss somebody off. The only reason I think that they might not do what you're talking about is because I think if you drop the PS4's price that low to the point you might create the perception amongst people who already own it that it's the budget option now. And then you're going to then you're definitely going to invite the ire of people. They're going to feel like they invested early on something that Sony has already decided to give up on.

And I don't think they want people to have that perception. So, I don't think they'll do it quite that way. I don't know. We'll see. Well, all right. So, exit questions then. Uh, twofold.

I'm going to I'm going to finally settle on October 13th, the day PSVR comes out is going to be the day the console comes out. And, uh, I'm going to say $300, same price. You think it's going to be the same price? Yeah. Wow. Um, that would be incredible. I I just don't think that's the Let me just I'm sorry to interrupt. That's the best scenario for them because they can at least say like, \"Yeah, it's more powerful, but we're not charging more for it.\" And and I think this will plate some people.

Right. Right. Um, so I think that the release date being the same or in the same month in October is pretty safe. Um, it's a pretty safe bet. I mean, like, why wouldn't you - you've got all this buzz that's going to be circling around about the PlayStation VR? That seems like an ideal time when someone is going to want to buy um a new piece of hardware that they don't own already, like a new console, like that's the time, right?

Um, so yeah, that makes enough sense. As far as the price goes, I don't see any maybe I'm overestimating how much of a power jump the uh the PS4 or the PS Neo will be, but I think probably 350 or 400 is more likely. So I think it's going to I think I mean, yeah, would it be ideal if they could make it 300? Sure. But I don't know how they could get an appreciable jump in power at 300, you know, like I feel like they could, you know, in an ideal world, the idea for me is that the Neo makes PSVR better, you know, and I don't see how you could make a system that specs high enough to make PSVR significantly better without making it",

Steam's a great example of that, right? Um, and I just I think that from a historical standpoint, this is kind of significant because we're now getting into the space not of literally modular consoles, which I think would be way smarter. And I don't know how they would do that. I'm not an engineer, but they should have figured out how to do that a long time ago. That makes me see that makes me sense that they did not anticipate this when the PS4 came out.

My concern is twofold. The game is actually getting comically long in the tooth just in it. It's it's it was announced when I was in college. I'm 31, right? Yeah. The game was announced. Everyone's like, \"Well, it wasn't really Final Fantasy XV.\" I'm like, \"Shut up. It was Final Fantasy XV this entire time and it had a different name. It's the same game.

And I'd be absolutely shocked if this game was anywhere in the same league as Persona 5, which I think people already pretty much understand is going to be a great game. Now, I don't want to prejudge it. I'm not a Persona fan. I just know the way people feel about Persona 4, about how much time the Internal Atlas team took. Persona team took on this game.

No, I mean like I and I'm I'm not not excited, but I'm not excited either. Like I haven't really been paying too much attention. Like Destiny is something that I reviewed and then reviewed one expansion and then kind of totally fell off that wagon and handed that to someone else to cover. Um you know, Jose does uh Otto does the bulk of our uh Destiny coverage. and uh you know Destin Legarie also um over at IGN does a lot of the video features and gameplay stuff and and like let's plays and whatnot.

I feel I feel like Destiny's in Diablo II mode where the base of what came out was so flawed in terms of its structure and and then they recognized that and with through release like DLC release and expansion release after release and patch and patch and patch they they patch it to be as good as it can be based on what the foundation that it was built on, but it's still never going to be as good as it could have been, right?

My question, would I be in a similar situation if I were to visit Sony Santa Monica, Sony San Diego, or any other AAA devs out there?

I don't think it's any other factor because games haven't gotten longer, they've gotten shorter.

Maybe Hello Games is certainly going to be fine.

They're both maybe a little bit shallow. They're both kind of uh buggy and maybe not as polished as they could be.

In other words, um a game like The Banner Saga before. I never beat it, but I I spent a lot of time with it and I liked it. And it's a it's a strategy RPG. It's kind of light.

We already have a Journey, you know, and like we already have that game. We don't need another one. And but if Abz\u00fb came out first, I might feel that way about Journey, you know. It's just that Abz\u00fb had no emotional resonance with me. The timing was off. It was not it it too late, you know. And so I feel like Yeah, you're right. People should experiment because I think a lot of the timing comes a lot of the a lot of rather the the reception comes with timing, comes with the zeitgeist.

And I think we're kind of getting a lot of us are getting tired of playing the same old thing over and over again. I think you're starting to see franchise fatigue in a real way. I think you're starting to see um uh a moroseness about the way we kind of receive some games and and a sort of um stagnation in the way games are delivered.

It's because it's old. You know, I saw that Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom, whatever the that game's called today. I was like, \"This game looks awesome.\" Because it looks like",

Level 5 is a great developer when it comes to RPGs, and this one, I believe, was their first attempt at a traditional strategy RPG, and it did not disappoint. It plays very similar to a Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem. I remember really enjoying the characters and story in the game, providing a pretty decent challenge in its later battles. I still regard it as one of the best strategy RPGs I've ever played in one of PSP's best games, thanks for Versus XIII. There's a lot of adoration for that game, and so I thought I would uh And I've never actually played it. Yeah, I I used to see it on my on my store shelf a whole lot, but I I never got around to to grabbing it. Uh, Level-5 is a good developer.

I am unwinding with a few Overwatch matches on a Sunday afternoon. My team was kicking ass and I was doing a pretty good job clearing the path for my team as Tracer. It was the last 30 seconds of the match and we were inches away from capturing our objective when out of nowhere a sniper shot takes me out.

Um it certainly started out very strong with the competitive uh with competitive players and it's still very strong with competitive players. Although some things that have come to light about the game's engine, most uh most notably the uh like the native eight frames of input lag that are kind of just kind of coded into the way the game works have soured some people's uh ideas about it and they're looking to see that fixed.
