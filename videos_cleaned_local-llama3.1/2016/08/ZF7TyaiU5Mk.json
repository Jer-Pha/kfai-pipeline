I can't remember who Romeo was. Leonardo DiCaprio was Romeo. John Leguizamo, the guy from Oz, is in everything now. Ernie Hudson wasn't in it, no; he was in another movie as well. Yeah, look that up. Hurry up, stop **** around. But Claire Danes was okay. Well, I mean this is like yeah, cuz this was the thing. This hits when I'm in high school and this is like her first big movie after my so-called life.

All of them had really... this is one of the things that I loved about his style. I love about his style is that he really picks like you can tell he sits and listens to music, and like envisions the story through music, which is the most important thing. Which is really, really awesome because they look; they're all sort of like really long, amazingly directed music videos. Um, but with awesome **coverage** of the song. I'm thinking specifically more M-R-I if I remember. If I forget what the song was, there was a Prince cover in Romeo and Juliet. What was it though? I'm trying to figure out.

That's what it was called, I guess, and so they called it Oz. But I don't know if I think maybe it was Oswald Penitentiary, yeah, that sounds right. I don't know. It was literally 14 years, it will ruin your perception of J.K. Simmons. He played J. Jonah Jameson in the first three Spider-Man movies, super fun guy. Now he's Commissioner Gordon, he was like the leader of the neo-Nazis, the skinheads, and he was horrible, and it was awesome, man. That show is that show is...
