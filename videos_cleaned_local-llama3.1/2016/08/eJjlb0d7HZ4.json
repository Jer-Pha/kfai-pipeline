He's like a figure skater going down. I've been known to skate in some figures. We are all doing it, Colin. We're going to have a fun show today. I saw a video of choreographed swimmers and they were like doing dances and they did Let It Go from Frozen and there's some guy outside of the pool. They're Japanese of course because they're the most creative people in the entire goddamn world. They're out there. There's the one leader and he's just going like this and the people will jump out of the water like they're ice. That's awesome. It was great. I'm like, how can we do that?

I love what you guys do on the show. But second, I didn't realize we were actually recording. I thought we were still doing sound checks until right now. So, that was kind of funny. That's how we do things. Kevin starts us and Kevin says, \"Let's go.\" Yeah. I was just staring blankly like, \"Wait a minute. We're recording. Give me this. Pull out the scary part. All right.

So far, so normal. But here's the twist. We've heard the screen is bookended by two controller sections on either side, which can be attached or detached as required. Then when you get home, the system can connect to your TV for gaming on the big screen. A base unit or dock station is used to connect the brain of the NX within the controller to display on your TV. Nintendo NX will use game cartridges as its choice of physical media. Multiple sources have also told us considering NX's basis as a handheld first and foremost, the choice may not come as too much of a surprise. Although we have heard the suggestion that Nintendo recommends a 32 GB cartridge. So that's Blu-ray, we're talking 25.5 gigs normally. So that's right in the ballpark, right? Cartridge check has changed so much that optical media doesn't matter nearly as much as it",

Cartridge check has changed so much that optical media doesn't matter nearly as much as it used to. There it's so cheap now to make a cartridge that it's not a deterrent anymore. Yeah. So, inside the NX stated above, the system will harness Nvidia's powerful mobile processor Tegra. Graphical comparisons with current consoles are difficult due to the vastly different nature of the device. But once again, we've heard Nintendo is not chasing graphical parity. Quite the opposite, it's sacrificing power to ensure it can squeeze all this technology into a handheld. Something which also tallies earlier tallies with earlier reports. So, it will be less powerful than the PS4. Kotaku backs a lot of this up saying, \"Unlike many previous NX rumors, this Eurogamer rumor has weight.

Finally, we've heard from one source that the NX planning has recently moved up a gear within Nintendo ahead of the console's unveiling, which is currently slated for September. After the confused PR fiasco, the Wii U launched, the company's already settling on a simple marketing message for NX of being able to take your games with you on the go. Good news. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I I think this is I think this is good news. Absolutely. This sounds awesome. Yeah, 100%. Like I mean, and I feel like I was talking about it today on Call Live.

I travel so much. The idea of sitting on a plane and playing the full-fledged Zelda: The Wind Waker it's I can't wait. I'm very excited for that. Well, they're they're breaking that down that two-tier development wall. I mean, part of the problem that VA had early on was that it was very expensive to develop, you know, quote unquote AAA games for this handheld and there was a lot of kind of an identity crisis when you also had a high-end console.

They they they fumbled the ball in many different ways, but the Wii U is fundamentally something where you have a more powerful unit sending something to a dummy. Now, it's the other way around. You the power is in your hands and the dummy what's connected to your TV. This is a recognition of a lot of different things. I think they're hoping this will play well in Japan where, frankly, people play most of their games on handheld. I think uh that that they're recognizing the switch to mobile here.

Why not? This is this it's going to be it's going to come down to the software. Can they do will they have the support? Will they have the games that we want at launch? And will they keep games coming for 3 years after that? I think that's the bigger question. And I think the the solution is there in the fact that if they're not making 3DS and Wii U games and they're just focusing on the NX games, I think that then all of a sudden there is a lot of games like the when you look at the 3DS output, the vast library over there, it's like it has, you know, every couple months there'd be something.",

But when you add those together and all those people working on games with one cause, even third parties when you look at the third parties that are making 3DS games, um no one's really making Wii U games but if they're suddenly making Nintendo console games which is the NX, that's a solid lineup and especially if it is unique games that are the Nintendo games, you know the people want Nintendo games and Nintendo consoles, that's the only reason the Wii U even sells what it does sell right so if there was one dedicated thing you always talk about Nintendo being a toy and this I think is total total total recognition that they're not competing with the PS4 and Xbox One in the console space.",

Um which is a which is going to be a problem for them. Battery life is going to be a problem probably. Yeah. And uh but I do agree with with Jared in terms of the optical media argument. Um the fact of the matter is the last time Nintendo used cartridges the way we think about them was N64, but really in reality they've been using cartridges actually on their handhelds for a long time.

So, there's not going to be this. Everyone's like, \"These games are going to be expensive.\" Like, no, they're not. Um, they're not going to be any more expensive than the games you play now. Uh, that's just not logic. That's just not sound at all. They're not Nintendo's not going out and charge $80 for a game. It's just not going to happen. So, um, I think it's smart. I'm excited about it. I'm interested in it. I I think what's going to be important to Jared's point is, uh, the games that are going to be ready.

Um I do think this alienates third parties uh again um without being on par without having parity with PS4 and Xbox One. People are going to have to make their experiences exclusive to this. Uh I am sure that a lot of publishers are going to do something um and they're not going to see returns on it probably and so they're going to stop. I mean this is what happens VA.

I'm just really interested to see what the infrastructure, online infrastructure, how does that work? Is there a trophy and achievement system? Um, how does the store work? How does it function with Wii U and 3DS? Remember this was supposed to be kind of a pillar um similar to the GBA, GameCube, DS kind of thing back in the day.

So many people, you know, with the Wii U, like this came up on uh Colin Moriarty's stream today of some guy's like, \"Well, what's the difference between this and the Wii U gamepad? You could play games on that.\" I was like, \"Yeah.\" And I made a joke about like being 14 inches from it or whatever, like being tethered to it. But it was true that people really enjoyed that feature of when people first got their Wii Us, they moved them to the bedroom so they could sit there and watch TV with their wives or whatever and play games or you know, you always saw like the super obsessed",

There's no way it can be. And that's the big thing that's that's here's the real talk about about Wii U and why they have to learn a lot from 3DS or whatever. 3DS and Wii U are really shitty pieces of hardware.

You would think the sweet spot's $299, but this thing sounds if everything's, you know, it's going to have a nice battery in it. It's going to have to have a nice screen. It's going to have all sorts of, you know, uh, gyro in it, all sorts of Wi-Fi and all sorts of things. It's probably going to be like $400. So the, you know, I think that's crazy though.

Nintendo's original Wii debuted at a price point of $250. I think we forget how important that was to its early success.

I understand that that makes sense. I just I don't think I can't see them doing that. I think Nintendo, at least so far, what they've done nothing to prove to me that they're not just about each game being its own specific world. Nintendo games have had achievements for years.

Um, beyond that, they're very good at telling us what we want as opposed to giving us what we want. Exactly. And then that that's what they do.

Um I hope that they make it so that it's easy and fun to play Smash Bros or Mario Kart with multiple people if you only one person needs the system.

Mega Man 9 or 10 work not just because they have they have the adornments of an old Mega Man game, but because and I think it's Jeremy Parish that originally said this, uh they take what made Mega Man work and then inform that design with 25 years of game development that's happened since and infuse that learning in without losing the spirit of what was originally there. They create something that feels like the original yet is also absolutely new and tremendously inventive, but it's so well orchestrated. You don't even really realize that until you're done.

The question for these products is the question what's happening here is are they going to give us what Greg said earlier this just feels like more Green Hill Zone or are they going to give us something that's so well-designed that it's doing new things without those new things feeling invasive of the space and the aesthetic and that's going to be what this lives or dies on. I really think so. I think that for me when when it comes to Sonic, there is uh I I am a Sonic fan. I would say overall, even though the more games there's more games I dislike than games I like.

Um then then going forward from there, Sonic Colors was a great step in the right direction of this is fun. This is good. And then Generations nailed it. Generations was a game nailed it in terms of it's a solid 7.8 to 8.5 range game of like this is fun. I enjoyed playing this. For more numbers, go to IGN.com. Yeah, exactly. Um I love that. And then they kind of like totally **** it up with Sonic Lost World and really badly with Sonic Boom. Uh but what I've always wanted is just more of the original trilogy.

I think Sonic 1 and 2 are very interesting video games. They were especially interesting at the time because they were technological marvels.

This Sonic thing sounds like a half step because like they're using some old stuff and milking people's nostalgia, but to Jared's point, and I know I belabored this point to begin with, so I'm not trying to be mean, like Sonic isn't Mega Man like from a gameplay perspective, it's just not.

And I agree with and I agree with what Jared says is that when I played Sonic as a kid, I didn't have the outrageous hatred I have for it now.

But we got Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5D with that one where that was bad. The level design sucked. They didn't tell the levels didn't tell a story. The best thing about Sonic 3 that I think is so overlooked is that every single level segues into the next level.

Sonic is a first extremely well visually and auditorially polished attempt to convert arcade design philosophy to console and platforming type games where you have to be able to go back and play it again and again and again and not get tired of it.

I mean, the fact is that in Japan, the history of the way RPGs rolled out on console kind of created a myth that RPGs were more popular in Japan than the United States. No, we were just all playing ours on computer for a very long time. And RPGs were literally invented in the United States on pen and paper, became successful on computers, were the earliest examples of video games, created the home gaming market. Then in Japan, people started playing on computers, but consoles blew up at a time that our console industry was in a slump. So it became popular on console there, and it took a while for us to catch up. That was simply a historical cultural nuance based on the fact that there was a video game market crash in 1983 and '84 here in the console space, but not the PC. Did I explain that at all or was",

So what I'm saying there is sometimes factors of history within a country. Count countries exist for you know they things happen in one country that don't happen in another economically and historically that changes things tremendously. In '84 when the American console industry was collapsing Japan's prospered therefore RPGs prospered on console at a time that they would have otherwise here but never got the chance to. Took years for us to catch up. Because of that we missed out on the beginnings of popular franchises like let's say Dragon Quest. We almost missed out on Final Fantasy.

And then you go to Europe, you think about what happened in the European game industry. They started on microcomputers and a lot of those were domestically designed microcomputers. There was a period of history for about 10 years when people were figuring out what home computers were going to be. Most of them were built on two common architectures. There's a few others.

And so these cheap home computers became kind of a way for video games to infiltrate the home, usually on cassette tape. They cloned a cassette tape longer than we did over there. And their games were they cost much less than they did here in that format. A cassette tape there might cost half what a video game cost here at the time. So it created a market for this kind of okay well what are our considerations?

Uh my all-time favorite video game is the NES port of Sid Meier's Pirates! done by programmed by Rare released by Ultra, which was Konami in the United States. Um, and uh, while Pirates uh, is a superb computer game, that port, particular port of Pirates is so smooth, it strips out a couple of features that I didn't care about anyway. But the sword fighting and ship combat is way less choppy than it is on most computer platforms. And yet, it doesn't have like the over adornment that later things like Pirates Gold or or the remake had. And I don't have to worry about the DDR dancing or any of that.

It was a breakout hit on PC, but it it console ports were not that big a deal for pirates. Um, so that's one that comes to mind. Geez, obscure, I don't know. Um, I guess Angband's probably obscure and I really enjoy Angband. Um, which is a a uh there are two kinds of rogue likes.

Religion is one of those things. It's one of the great divides in video gaming.

And uh people are afraid of alienating their audience or they're trying to pander to it. I mean, a lot of video games that have gone down that road kind of do it like Cecil B.
