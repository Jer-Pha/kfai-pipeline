That was simply a historical cultural nuance based on the fact that there was a video game market crash in 1983 and '84 here in the console space, but not the PC. Did I explain that at all or was that really confusing? I love you'd okay I'm a little worried about that. I was afraid I was ranting so what I'm saying there is sometimes factors of history within a country - countries exist for you know they things happen in one country that don't happen in another economically and historically, that changes things tremendously. In '84 in the American console industry was collapsing Japan prospered therefore RPGs prospered on Console at a time that they would have otherwise here but",

It took years for us to catch up because of that; we missed out on the beginnings of popular franchises like Dragon Quest. We almost missed out on Final Fantasy. Uh, so there's one uh I think I mean cultural differences too right, especially talking about Japan, especially talking about Monster Hunter, which didn't last as a topic. Right? I noticed something you know obviously I love V now and I loved PSP back in the day and that was like my beat at AT&T on PlayStation and I remember when somebody pointed out to me that all my reviews mentioned being on the train because I took the train into work, and like that's not what most of America does.
