My ritual it's kind of similar to Colin's uh to an extent in that it is a very active experience when I listen to music. I'm listening to music, that's it um I can't work while listening to music, that's so foreign to me and I it's it's not even to say that it's distracting, it's like that's kind of the that's not even right like music to me is the it's the focus um the idea of multitasking doing something while music is playing is just beyond me. I I'm not even capable of it like I I really like to just lay on my bed put some headphones on and listen to an album front to back, and that I I it's more than just listening to it, it's listening to it and then thinking about it after and then listening to it again based on the thoughts that I had the first time and like kind of like growing and experiencing it",

I mean, so to be fair, that is a very different random situation - the car specifically with Greg it's just like it's a whole disaster but that's because car rides and road trips are where the playlist comes into play, where I'm totally down with that. But music, the album experience with other people is way too hard for me to even try to comprehend because you can't share that experience with somebody else; every car ride is a single song world, and it's totally you need to respect the other people in the car.
