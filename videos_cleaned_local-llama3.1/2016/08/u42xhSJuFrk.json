Um which is accurate because I think it means sorrow or sorrowful. Um but uh the more I played that game, the more I really enjoyed it to where it's now like one of my favorite games for sure. Um what I really liked about it is is the the post not post game, but the pre-final boss nature. You can go all the way up to the final boss and then it opens a little portal for you and you can like leave and go back and then it opens up all the side quests for you to do.

It's probably a fantastic game but yeah, it's comfort food as Alexa Rae Joel put it and I feel like uh I just appreciated the more I played and so I beat it and I beat the the optional bosses did all the side quests uh got all the trophies and um and uh I really liked it. I played Abzu and beat it. I've played that Abzu. Yeah, that was my thing, too. I did a Games Cast topic.

I just feel like we already it's like it's like uh Bizarre World Seinfeld where it's like we already have a George. Yeah. Yeah. It's like we already have a journey. Yeah. We already have that game. And uh I know that we seem to be in the minority on it. It seems like a lot of people find Abz\u00fb at the very least to be a tranquil and cerebral kind of game.

Journey was just sucked me in. It made me upset. It made me cry. Yeah. It was **** sad. I don't know what it was, but it was just it was just I I didn't think about playing it. I didn't think about It didn't feel like I was playing anything in that game. That was the thing. Abz\u00fb feels like a game and it has collectibles. I know you can ignore these things, but I'm like, these things already make it gamey. And then I feel like it's kind of the plot from Flower. Like the world's polluted and the water's now the water's and I'm like, okay.

I'm like, all right, I got to get this light. There's a bunch of lights in people's chests. And the thing about Abzu is that the controls are clunky. Like there there were times there was a specific trophy I was just trying to get. I I got 50% of the trophies. I was like the game doesn't track your collectibles. I'm like there's no way in God's green earth I'm going back and getting all that **** So I just got I cleaned up a few of the trophies and one of the trophies was like in the last chapter to jump on this iceberg where there's like a polar bear and it took me five minutes to jump on like I'm like why won't you just grab the edge and then he's like going under and like and I'm like just grab the **** edge there.",

Why does it No, I when I was playing it and when I was doing it, yeah, I was having those same control issues where it's like I'm going and then it's like I started doing like the 360 and I'm like, \"No, no, no. I just wanted you to go up like **** All right. Well, we're going through that. We're doing this over here.\" That was the thing. You were I was cognizant the whole time I'm playing a game. Yeah. And and so I I I I don't mean to be disparaging. They seem like very nice people that made the game. It's their first game, I think. Squid. Giant squid. Is that what it's called?

My impressions are extremely preliminary. Sure. About as preliminary as possible. Well, no, mine are even more preliminary than yours. I'm uh it's pros and cons like Kevin. Like Kevin, I can already see this game developing exactly what it's going to be. Yeah. It's a grind for resources and it's uh it's going to hearken back to the that explorative nature that some games always tap into. Um but like to the nth degree.

Like I like I think see the problem I'm I'm reaching with No Man's Sky. I'm going to dedicate some time to it tonight and really see how I play. I want to play it for a few hours and like really like see. Yeah. Um is that there's just too many other games that are like I want to play that game Brutal: Above the Sun. I want to play Hyper Light Drifter um really bad. So like there's just other stuff that's kind of like percolating right now. See, I think I'm going to go the opposite of it where there is other stuff that I I want to play and there's a bunch of stuff coming out, but I think No Man's Sky from what I played, it seemed like it had the hooks of me that, you know, I liked",

I like that kind of thing. And I'm anxious to get the ship up and running. And like that's the thing is like I'm anxious to get this podcast done and get it cooking and eat dinner so I can sit down and play it and actually devote the time it deserves and needs to actually get into and figure out what's going on. Yeah, I can respect that. I think the thing with me is that in a positive way, it's in my head. Like I'm thinking about it like, \"Huh, there's nothing I've never played a game like this.\" I can already tell I've never played a game like this. I like the way it opens when you're just drifting through the stars. You see all the different bits and I like the distances. Like you haven't gotten off a planet yet, but like the distances involved and everything is pretty",

Like you haven't gotten off a planet yet, but like the distances involved and everything is pretty cool. Like you really have to like tear it up to get to like anywhere. Like it's just like the game is so slow otherwise you have to use your space warp drive, whatever. I don't know what space warp drive is. Uh, but I feel like it's going to appeal to the procedural nature of like, and I don't mean procedurally generated, I mean a procedural like I do this to get this, then I get this. Exactly. I do this. There's a game of cat and mouse on sticks, right? Exactly. And so the thing that disturbs me about it, well, two things, interesting things. First of all, the whole roll out of the game has been really weird. Uh, you and I talked about it a little bit this weekend, but I've never seen Sony treat a game like this in a decade, almost a decade of time. a lot of emails from",

But I was like, \"Huh, like it's very weird what's going on with this game.\" And then second, um, and I think maybe more fundamental and more important to it is that people already have the platinum trophy. Now, the game has been out for a lot some people for about a week or better part of a week. So, I mean, it's possible, but I'm like, that's interesting. Like, I was looking at the trophies today just to see. I'm like, no one can have like some of these trophies, right? And it's like 1% of people that already have the platinum and like every some of these showies have you know like that's",

So maybe the rumors of like you're going to see everything in 30 or 40 hours is true. We'll have more to come beyond that. I still think this game still strikes me and Shawn Murray said himself it's going to be divisive. I think that's what he said. And I think this game is going to suffer mightily from its expectations similar to how I think The Last Guardian also I want to get into all that. But yeah, I think the thing about it like when Shawn Murray demoed it for me, Kevin, and I think it just us kind of funny at E3 two years ago, it was the conversation of what this game launches at and what it looks like 6 months and a year from now is different things. And so I understand the basic having a basic trophy list, you know what I mean? If you can find them in 30 hours",

If you can find them in 30 hours, that's fine. I think personally, don't get me wrong. But it is the idea that they're going to keep rolling out these updates that will continue to make the game better and do these different things and make it so you want to get back into it and find out this new planet, find these new creatures, you know, blow up, whatever the hell it's going to be that way. Yeah, I want to I want to name my planets. I want to name it. See, the thing the thing is is that if if you're looking for a density, a volume of things to do, it seems like there's a lot to do in the game. Like in an hour, I was already feeling almost overwhelmed where I'm like, I have all these resources. I found these things that are asking me to build these grenades now or something. I have this new space drive. I got to go into",

Well that that's the kind of gamer you are right where I think you can if you want to go through and critical path this thing in 30 hours you get the platinum but you're not that guy. You are the guy of every beacon that pops up you're going to need to go. Yeah. So I every planet you're about to pass like but what if something cool is there you going to turn it off.

I'm sure it won't be next week, but the week after that when we've played more games, cast updates, and things like that as we go. So I'm... I'm interested in seeing more, but it's certainly in my mind - which is more than I can say about a lot of games. So yeah, it's definitely... and that's the whole thing: this is a game that I've been anticipating for a long time, and it is a game now that I've had a taste of - I want more of, which is not something that doesn't happen often, but lately I have been doing that thing of like, \"oh, Galun, great.\" And I put it in and I play it, and I'm like, all right, cool.

I think it's available on DS or 3DS and Wii U or something, but uh really fun game. And then they just released Super Challenge last week. And what's so funny about this game, what I think so daring and weird about it is that it's so **** hard. Like if you if you never played to the very end and did everything in Super Mutant Alienation, like the game's going to just kick your ass. And I I think that's kind of interesting that they just released a game that's not obviously and the new one's on PS4 in PS Vita. Not obviously a like a continuation. You think it was just a sequel. It's going to be easy in the beginning, gets harder at the end. It's just it kicks your ass at the very beginning. It already died.",

Baker's dozen if your baker hates you. Uh, number one, it appears that PlayStation 4 Neo's official reveal is less than a month away. Word comes by way of Vice, which reports alongside French gaming website Game Informer. It's very original name. You know, you get that URL, you got to keep it. You got I mean, definitely that will be revealed to the press and public at an event on September 7th in New York City. The official name of the new PS4 iteration is still unknown. It's worth noting",

The official name of the new PS4 iteration is still unknown. It's worth noting that PlayStation 4 was itself revealed at an event in New York City in early 2013. This could be Sony's way of keeping the good energy moving with the console by going back to the place where it all began. I think it's super interesting that they're doing this in New York and I like that. Um, the interesting thing that the story said to me, I don't know if you saw this, was that devkits will be going out, final dev kits will be going out around the same time. Does this indicate that this system doesn't come out this year? Um yes, I think it does. Don't you? I do. I do too. I mean, I think that's I don't want to say it's obvious, but I think it would be really weird.

Yeah, this is an analog to Scorpio. So, I feel like they are I I feel like the components are already made. I don't know that they can like basically bring this back to the drawing board, but maybe they're just giving it more time. I would love for it to come out on October 13th. That would be ideal with VR. That would be **** awesome. I'd love that. to buy them both. But I'm already getting VR, but I'd buy the Neo. I'm going to buy the Neo when it comes out.

I'd be like yeah it's going to come out this year. But that devkit thing kind of threw me for a loop where I'm like well are the games ready? Like you're going to you're the devs, let's say they go out now, you're going to have these guys and I'm sure they're building benchmarking the games on PC to work on what what you know, I'm sure I mean that's the way games are made, but are they then going to have five, six, seven, eight weeks to make sure these things run and then get them through certification and then get the patches out and all that kind of I don't know.

It's a notable patch because of how much it seems to change the game and how close to launch it came, forcing Sony to withhold copies from the press until the morning of Monday, August 8th, so this morning as we're recording this, less than a day before it becomes publicly available.

Hello Games will continually update No Man's Sky this way. This is the first of many. It will be available on Monday for press for review once it exits submission and on launch day on PC and PS4. We expect future updates like these to continue to be free. Yep. For 99.9% of people, all you have to do is install the update before you begin to play.

Nighttime and day skies are now four times more varied due to new atmospheric systems, which refracts light more accurately to allow for more intense sunsets. Planet rotation.

With everyone having a different experience with the game, do you think that by having multiple reviewers discuss their experience? This may give a better understanding and review of what a game is.

Would you rather play a procedurally generated game or one where each level has been hand-built?

Is one way inherently better than the other? What are your thoughts? Thanks for all you do. I think one way is inherently better than the other way and I think that is handcrafting the stages but procedurally generated stages and levels and areas make sense in certain kinds of games like No Man's Sky, which is just simply too big and ambitious to handcraft all its planets. They're going to procedurally generate them instead. Rogue Legacy is all about not being able to master it, not knowing what's there, and unpredictability.",

Um no, I mean a lot of it is like you see these studios and you're like, \"Oh, if you guys should you should try this or maybe you guys should position the game more like this or maybe you guys should think about that stuff.\" But again, as a platform, it's not your job to tell them what to do with their game. It's like, \"Hey, I'm not a marketing guy. I'm not this. I'm not that. I'm just the platform business partner.\" Um and so here we can actually impact that.

Cuz you know, being a suburb, a Chicago kid like me, that was always the thing. I remember, you know, Midway Games being the deal.

Usually once a year and you find them. But there's Wargaming. Those guys are in Chicago. Uh there's Phosphor still around. There's NetherRealm. Yeah. But I know Russ is doing a whole thing now. He's doing a Kickstarter right now about indie studios in Chicago. But I would say when big studios did when Yeah.

That's actually So, you know, I love Chicago. You know, I'm always going to rep Chicago no matter what. Um, but there's a reason we opened a second studio in Florida, right? It's because Chicago is actually like, it pains me to say, but it's a crummy place to start a game studio. Yeah. There's no local government support. It's really hard to recruit. People think because most game developers, they're West Coast or they're Texas or whatever. They think they're either going to freeze to death or get shot on the first day or something like that. Freezing to death. Yeah. A very real possibility. And so, uh, it's",

But getting people there is difficult and it's an expensive city relative to like Orlando for sure. And when we were looking, we knew we wanted to keep growing because again, like the thing with us being diverse, right, is like it was this really kind of uh like antithetical notion at the time. It's like was really reluctant to grow. We were like 32 people big, 35. And I realized that like wait to get more stable, we actually need to grow a lot because we we just can't do enough different things. Like if one of our projects goes away, we're out of business right now. And we need to be big enough where if one of them goes away, we're fine, you know?

Like that doesn't make sense. And so we kind of scoured the uh the globe, looked at a lot of different places. Orlando had a lot of things going for it. So we started off down there. So Chicago is like a really cool scene. Like you have a lot of like uh young horses there. There's a whole bunch of indie game teams that want to come up, but I don't think they have aspirations to be like we are. I think they want to be like eight, 10 people big and just make games forever, right? So, I think in the low-level indie scene, I think it's really strong.

That's a depressing note to end on. Well, I think it's like that over the whole country. It's not just Chicago. Sure. I mean, that's just kind of reflective of uh just the state of developers in general. Like, is it got to be big or tiny? There's like no room for the middle anymore. 100% 100%.

I thought it was pretty nice that he let you. I think he's joking. I hopefully hopefully he's joking around, but maybe his friend did just come by. I was like, I need a back, dick.

I have a suggestion for this week's forgotten PlayStation game, Steamboat Chronicles.\" No, Steamboat Chronicles. This was a great action RPG developed by Irrational. Is that right? Irrational for the PS2. I was initially drawn to the game by the beautiful cell-shaded art style and the incredibly deep character customization options. But what kept me playing was the fun (parenthesis though admittedly not very deep story, unique combat, and plenty plentiful music based on mini games and side quests.
