I know that it's not like it's called Mario World 2, and that kind of offends it - it's very deceiving. But when you take that away from just looking at it as Yoshi's Island, it is amazing. It's by far the best Yoshi's game; I don't think they'll ever make it a better Yoshi game. Um, but it is, as far as I'm concerned, pretty much perfect when it comes to the balance of platforming and interesting gimmicks in the levels that are fun. Uh, except for the Poochy thing - Poochy, the dog from The Simpsons. No, no, no... you Poochy! You Poochy! Correct. Uh, but the boss fights were amazing, and I think that's something that Mario at least back then always kind of struggled with was having fun different varied they were all the same - yeah, in Mario one it was just Bowser over and over; just different, with different... although that's not a Mario game, you know.

And then there was Super Mario World, which were just over and over and over again, the Koopa Troopas or there were the mini-bosses here and there. But this one, Super Mario 3D Land, every world had a mini boss, every world had a boss, each one of them totally different, and it was very, very fun. And I thought that the game had a Whimsical nature to it. And I think Yoshi's Island was um the last 2D Mario title that really had its own looking feel to it. Yeah, it definitely did have its own looking feel. Yeah, and it's it's awesome, it's beautiful, you know? Even the day graphics look at it, the storybook kind of feel was awesome. It's a pretty game.

However, Wii U brought it back in a crazy way; MLG has Smash Wii U, the Wii U scene is super like bustling and huge, and everybody's really into it. I think that the fact that there is a new Smash Bros giving Melee a run for it tomorrow, in 2016, like that's a really good thing. So shout out to you, Smash Bros Wii U! Next one, Amplitude - my God, I'm a Platformer fan. The original, the original, the original one, yeah, yeah... Uh, Platformers and Rhythm games are my favorite genres, and Amplitude just did it differently, and it really gave me the sense of speed going through the Rhythm games, but also I felt like I was actually doing something - DDR, you're reacting to the music, and you're just kind of hitting things at the timing. Amplitude, you're making the song, and that's something we with Guitar Hero and all that, and obviously, Rock Band Unplugged, yes... Um, obviously those are a bit more uh practical in the sense that you are.",

The problem is the soundtrack; it just doesn't have the license stuff um and it doesn't have a lot of the classic original stuff that the other one did. Some of the songs in the new one are great, but none of them really match that like the Special Sauce that the first one had. Um, shout out to Frequency too, but that one isn't as perfect. Journey is probably my best 2-hour gaming experience I've ever had; it's you just play it and you don't really know why you like it so much. You know, I think for me it's not that fun of a game; it's very pretty to look at but it's like what's the difference between me playing this or watching someone play it on YouTube? But there is a difference. You know, I think it's just that it's the man like you making it all happen, like you walking through and then",
