Uh, what we did was we did our top five favorite games so each one of us did a topic where we talked about it. But I thought it'd be cool to kind of... because as I did that I didn't even think about what I said then, cuz things change you know what I mean? It's an ever-flowing thing. How do you feel?

And I thought that the game had a Whimsical nature to it. And I think Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island was um the last 2D Mario title that really had its own looking feel to it, yeah. It definitely did have its own looking feel, yeah. And it's it's awesome, it's beautiful, you know. Even look at it, the storybook kind of feel was awesome. It's a pretty game.

Um so I'm trying to get the the obvious answers out in the in the beginning here Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver Pok\u00e9mon obviously one of my favorite games of all time, my favorite franchises of all time and I think a lot of people would be surprised that it's not Red and Blue that are my favorite or go or no no no it's Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver because they really perfected everything that Red and Blue uh put out there it built on the foundation add the day night cycle which which kept things interesting and back then was a new.",

Um, I I I'm not surprised that Red and Blue are like the prototypes. I mean, Green obviously is really like the original, but but like I understand why Red and Blue wouldn't be your favorites. Yeah, I mean they're great, I mean they're amazing and I they're definitely ranked high, but Gold Silver just they're superior in every way in terms of story in terms of uh the thing is Golden Silver was the last generation as far as I'm concerned to add um Pok\u00e9mon that felt like they they fit in but were different enough and you know kind of had an own.",
