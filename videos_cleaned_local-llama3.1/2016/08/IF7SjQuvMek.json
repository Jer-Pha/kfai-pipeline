Oh my gosh, out to Casper though! That movie when you came out in your life, I didn't see it - that's how much I'd missed it. That's right; I mean, I've seen plenty since then. I spent on TV. I've seen the Ghostbusters bit and everything going on. Oh, but it's just like I would see old Casper what I'm Caspari God! Casper was fatso and stinky. Yeah, there was something... Lord Christina Ricci, yeah? 'Cause you're a kid, yeah? You were her age. Oh no, I was that much younger than her. Um, what is the best video game trilogy? I personally believe it's the Arkham trilogy. Yeah, yeah! But I mean, that's MGS - that's like so what are the best 3 video games? It gets difficult, yeah.

I like Jack to a lot of people don't... I didn't like Jack three, weirdly enough. You think that we like how do you do all that Arkham games yeah are great and do a lot of amazing things but like the tank control sucked in Arkham Knight and again we're ignoring Origins Uncharted I would say I would be the best if we can count that since there's a fourth one... I don't, yeah, yeah.

SmackDown: Here Comes the Pain was a really good game. They do paginate them; I do believe that was the that was the SmackDown that I dropped out of wrestling and maybe the SmackDown vs Raw the first one they did. I dropped out of wrestling in college, but then when I moved off campus, and I was working at the Tribune, I had a girlfriend at the time, and I would be over all the time.

Uh, yeah. I also had my brother text me that he was trying to do Brock Lesnar's theme song in the word \"dun dun dun dun dun...\" Brother, something alright. Splinter Cell trilogy, I don't know. I was so many Splinter Cells in Sonic the Hedgehog; I mean, yes, it's not so... one, two, three. Here's the problem: yeah, CD, CD is there is a clear adventure all their own thing.

So if you think of Sonic, Sonic trilogy, Sonic 1, Sonic 2, and Sonic 3 & Knuckles. You gonna give tonight? You know, I'm not gonna give that sheet, that one. This thing is, I don't think I can give that best gaming trilogy. Yeah, it's good. Yeah, I'm not giving it best. We want to talk about Sonic makes me wanna go back and replay. I don't know, I love Sonic though. I know I love Sonic back in the day. I replayed one recently, like last year on the 3DS. Um, and one.

I won't where I think and I think that's why that's why I count 'cause it doesn't need to be narrative gameplay and what that is... sure it's a thing, it's a thing.

Yay show them okay what I'd like to know and Grant's it's on my mind cuz it's let's play today is Deus Ex Go, Lara Croft Go, the other Go game I can't remember are they all a Hitman Go?
