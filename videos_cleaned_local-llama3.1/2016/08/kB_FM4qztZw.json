Jamie and her are the one that have like their whole beef going on and their whole relationship's been really weird in the show as compared to in the books. Like, in the books, Jaime's like over her, 'I'll see you later,' whatever she's not queen of Westeros or anything yet in the books, so if he's over her is he all about Brienne? He's not about Brienne either, unfortunately. You know, he's just kind of like... I got to figure my **** out, you know? I think so, but dude, I want to see...

I'm asking you for your predictions of the future, but let's go back a bit. What would what would you have done with Season 6 then? Well, I mean, I feel like they just blew their load with this whole show. Like, why do one book per season? Like, there's so much in all these books; they're so dense. You could really... once I understand the first season, they don't know if the show's going to go or not; they don't know if it's going to catch on. I get it.
