            "text": "what's up guys Alfredo here from over at Twitch and YouTube, Alfredo Plays standing in for the Kinda Funny dudes. Just recently, they sent me down to Respawn Entertainment to check out Titanfall 2. Um, I got tons of hands-on with multiplayer, that's what we're talking about today. I did get a glance at campaign; I have my impressions on a separate Kinda Funny Reacts video somewhere on their YouTube channel. Anyways, this is multiplayer, and overall, I loved it, man. It was fun, and it was awesome. Some I had a great time playing. Essentially, if you enjoyed Titanfall as multiplayer, you're going to enjoy Titanfall 2's multiplayer. Um, they didn't take chances or big risks with Titanfall's multiplayer, and I've only played a small amount of this, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Like Titanfall's multiplayer was awesome, and I felt like the way that they wanted to approach this was let's just build upon it right, let's not try and do too much; let's just make what was great and amplify that, and they",

And they did a great job of doing that. Now I only got to play a little bit for 2 hours but I did get hands-on with three new maps: Boomtown, Homestead, and Ford Base Kaidan. And also got hands-on with three different game modes: Amped, Hardpoint, Pilot versus Pilot, and Bounty Hunt. Bounty Hunt is the new game mode, which essentially you get kills whether there it be AI or another player and you get money for those kills essentially. Then you take that, you turn it into a bank. The team with the most money at the end wins. I got hands-on with the two new Titans: Ion and Scorch, as you can see right there on the screen. Um, it was fun. I love the Titans. Uh, one of the things that I kind of had an issue with in terms of Titanfall's multiplayer was the three different Titans: The Strider, Atlas, Ogre. When it came",

Uh, one of the things that I kind of had an issue with in terms of Titanfall 2's multiplayer was the three different Titans - The Strider, Atlas, and Ogre. When it came down to it, it kind of just felt like you know one was beefier, the other one was faster, and the other one was kind of the in-between. These felt different and they felt like they had more personality to them so you know when I actually got to play with the different Titans - Ion and Scorch - they had different enough abilities that made me go okay like there's a different play style to this it's different than just like I can move faster or I could tank more hits. And so it was really, really cool. Um what you just saw right there was the anti-Titan LG-97 Thunderbolt, that's a new anti-titan weapon. So there are a lot of new weapons and abilities in Titanfall 2's multiplayer and like I said before I just felt like they're really just taking the angle of let's build upon what was great. Um I did get hands",

Um, I did get hands-on with the grapple; one of the cool things about like the grapple was it just fit into Titanfall, and I like that man, I like that they didn't try and go over the top and try to add things in everything that they added just felt like it fits. The grapple was something that was a great representation of that; Titanfall's movement was one of the great things about Titanfall, and the grapple just fit. I was able to do the traditional additional wall run and Bunny Hop, but then the grapple added and amplified to that gameplay in the sense that I could continue that from different angles and variations that I was not able to do before, and so I'm liking the way that they're approaching this multiplayer, and uh, I'm excited. Dudes, it played very well if you didn't enjoy Titanfall 2's Multiplayer.",

I think you guys would have a blast. Um, one of the cool things um being there is I felt like they really cared about you know the players in the sense that they were you know walking around asking us questions and how we would change things and what we thought about stuff, and not only showed you know because of course we were there and they wanted to make us happy or anything like that but I saw that in like in the game itself. You know me, I went into the settings, I checked to see if bumper jumper was there, and you know all the kind of settings I would like, and I saw that there was settings for dead zones, and dead zones essentially just help you know negate like drift on your analog stick but it could be very detrimental.",
