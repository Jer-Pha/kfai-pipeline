Right? Right, but it's always a Tom Waits about a different rumor, and all those rumors sound really bad. Now we're hearing rumors that sound really good, and so we're latching on to it. I really hope it's good, and I'm putting my faith into that. But the most important part is the fact that the rumor that is most likely to be true is that we'll hear more information in September about the NX. We've known it's going to be this year, but that made sense - sure. And I think that this has to be that right, so I'm excited. I found myself in a bunch of random situations thinking about that, just sitting around thinking about the MS like on my Xbox laying in bed thinking about it was beating dinner and like I just... yeah, it's slow.",

But then 3-4 months later in November, um, five minutes I don't know whatever I'm not going to math in November. There was an event in New York, yeah, where it was the real like here's the reveal of it - here's a lot like all the games you can play them for the first time and like it's not for this is the first time you play real games. Cuz at E3 they had all the tests soon as you ended the conference you can go back and play the demos, but all those Dead or Alive: Dimensions, me thing or Bayonetta 2 was pretty much what I would end up being in Nintendo Land, yeah.
