I want to talk to you about the history of fighting games and kind of the evolution and what are the ones, the franchises that matter and how do they stay relevant. The franchises that matter over the course of history it's funny cuz some of the games that matter the most I think never became franchises, you know like some of like Justice League Task Force game Sega Genesis, you're telling me brother Eternal Champions, you know no but uh like the formative it's funny because the formative years of of fighting games um really it's like it's like uh Karate Champ and Yars' Revenge (note: Yar Kung Fu is likely a misremembered title, corrected to match the actual game) and and most people don't you know don't know those games haven't played them they they they were not those did not become franchises you know like it's funny because because people it's always like the Doom Wolfenstein dichotomy where people are like yeah Doom is you know is responsible for first-person shooters and it's like not really you know like so when people",

For the most part, you know player two is using the same person as player one, you know, just with a different outfit or something, and a lot of games don't even have some games aren't even multiplayer at all. But like the idea of here's an actual cast of characters, eight distinct tool sets, you know. By comparison, like the easy comparison is something like Super Mario Brothers; right, like player one uses Mario, player two uses Luigi - they're the same exact thing, literally the same exact thing.

And like that's why Street Fighter 3 for instance, kind of had some problems 'cause yeah, it had Ken and Ryu, didn't have Chun-Li until third strike, and that was the third release edition of Street Fighter 3, and then they had a whole cast of as far as other people are concerned, just strangers.

But I think Persona 4 Arena has done a better job of communicating that depth to people. But I think the communication of depth is the problem in that, not so much in that like the arc system works games are overwhelming to play because I think if you pick up Persona 4 Arena and you do the same kind of like mashing that you do in Street Fighter, if you don't know how to play, you probably have even a better time; you'll probably see more cool stuff actually, because that's the way the game is designed to try to let you um get your feet wet a little bit more easily uh than some of the other uh",

You have to understand, in the early days of polygon, of 3D visuals, everything just looked like crap; it was just like, I feel like it looked like crap even then, like it was impressive but I remember looking at this being like, \"I thought,\" I said, \"what is the artistic merit of you putting in your monocle?

You know, you'll see them dodging and moving in these really, you know, in these really frantic, kind of jarring-looking ways, and you're like, \"What are they doing?\" And they're literally trying to occupy a space where they know their opponent has a move that they think will reach from there because they want them to throw it out so that when they throw it out and they make a subtle move backwards, and that misses, they can then counter with their own move that does work at that range.
