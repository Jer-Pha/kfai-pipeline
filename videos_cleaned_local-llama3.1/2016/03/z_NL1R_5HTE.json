Sharon, how you Anson mmm. Would you rather be able to fly or be able to teleport? Teleport. Oh, see okay. I've so many questions. Yeah, okay, tell me nothing if you ask questions. I've I have so many answers because I've thought about this deeply. So ask away. So for flight, yes, how fast can I thought you can fly a little bit fit like twice as fast as you can run but it's just as hard as running so the faster you get by the time you get there you're sweating and your clothes are wet and they're kind of sticky afterwards and you're out of breath. So what's the con to teleporting? Teleporting is like an electric shock; it's like this stuff times 10. So you teleport, ah, ah, and it's like it hurts for a few seconds afterwards. Couple questions: can you only teleport, and you can only teleport like 30 times in a 24-hour period go to",

Can teleport from my house to your house that's New York on up to that's just that's a one tell that's one teleport okay fine from my house to your house yeah then from your house to Starbucks yeah and then back and then to Gia back at any Starbucks to Gia right no not yet you're not gonna hit 30 times a 24-hour period and then back yeah and then I can go yeah go tonight can I go can I go crazy for a second share please do you could teleport from here to the surface of Mars for four seconds and then teleport back so I I'm not going unless you",

We want to teleport, okay, so you can carry somebody, but it feels like giving them a piggyback ride even if I'm carrying like this. Uh, yeah, if you're carrying lines is about as hard as giving... So you can fly a little bit, but then at some point let's hear in really good shape, you gotta fly down so you can't. But socks, I feel like I approach this from the economic standpoint of trying to get cheaper flights for myself and my wife, 'cause if I go, she tends to follow yeah, uh, or rather everywhere she goes, I tend to follow because she likes travel a lot, yes. Let's get expensive gear up or to South you know to Asia um so there's a way I'm physically capable of carrying her there on my back more without stopping multiple times in the ocean which would probably lead to our death right?

Um, while you murder me and I could say like I'm tired of hearing about trending games or 2015 and I just twist like his arm piece and pull it off in the vacuum; it goes in there and then I teleport away.
