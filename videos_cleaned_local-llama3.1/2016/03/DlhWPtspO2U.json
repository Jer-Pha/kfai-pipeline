Like most people, it's rare to meet somebody who's like \"I hate books,\" I hate TV; there's nothing that would ever motivate me to watch one of those things. So, like, as we move towards the thing where the walls fall down and yes, everyone games in some way. My mom - I would never get one; my mom wanted a Wii, and then when she bought a 3DS on her own, I was like \"all right, cool.\" But like that you know for everything that's wrong about mobile gaming, that's one of the things it has done is that it's brought a whole bunch of people in, and you know granted maybe only 1% of those people ever move over to our kind of gaming or play games that we really care about, but they're playing games - good enough, whatever you know what I mean.

I'm not mad at that, like it's okay. I play a lot of games casually, I play a few games hardcore, like I am a hardcore player of certain games and I am just a gamer in general when it comes to being like... I think that I air on the hardcore side when it comes to knowledge of the industry and the overall thing, but it's like when it comes to playing, I'm not playing all these online things, like I'm not playing so many of the AAA games that come out. So it's like, does that not make me hardcore? Does that make me casual? I don't really give a ****, yeah. So it's like... I think it's more funny",

You know, everyone just needs to be like, \"We're just gamers,\" whatever you're into - talking about Call of Duty or Madden. It's just like those games change over time, you know what I mean? Like it used to be Halo, and it used to be... it was always Madden, but like, um, it's just funny that casual is also mobile games, and Nintendo is also casual.

Like ah okay, yeah all right, a bit of bite says hey guys this question is for Colin though open to all you often say that the games released this console generation are really nothing new and could have existed on PS3 or 360 with VR happening in the near future will we see some new genre defining games or will it be the same ****",

I'm not really sure how it's going to fit into the gaming space, to be honest. Like, I've tried a couple of things on, and just personally, I felt nauseous most of the time. Um, which ones were you using? Oculus or both times? Yeah, um, and also, it's just that you know there's look Google Glass is really cool like the concept of Google Glass and a lot of functionality to what it does is actually really cool.

Um, why I'm not inverting X, I don't know. So I mean, but it, but I didn't grow up with PC games and flight simulators and stuff, and I didn't grow up in that and with those, so I don't know how or when or where this happened. It might be something as simple as back in the day there weren't inversion um options in some games and you did play inherently inverted or inherently not inverted, and I wonder if I just grasped like my brain just grasped onto a game I played as a young kid, mhm, um, where that just made sense so that when I got to the DualShock.",

Colin, great final question: Why didn't they put this on the Vita? I don't know. You don't have to play it with other people, though.

Yeah, we read that on Colin and Greg, and it's it was great to read that where they're like we could obviously do this but we don't, yeah, very smart move. Yeah, and that's why I'm sorry, God no, no, please. I was saying that's why GTA V is GTA 5 sold like what is it, like 50 or 60 million copies or something like that because they don't milk Grand Theft Auto, yeah, and so Grand Theft Auto 6 when it comes out in 2018 or 2019, whatever it's going to be like they didn't even.",

Wargaming made a really astute thing where they're like, \"We don't even make a retail game,\" like why would we? We don't need to be E3. And Disney's like, \"We want to connect directly with our fans.\" Which I thought said a lot about media and how unimportant it is for them for media to play their stuff, like they don't care.

But in terms of fans getting their games, yeah, you'll still see Call of Duty or whatever at these places if it's playable, you know what I mean? You'll have them there ready to go. Madden will be there, yeah, no, for sure. I mean, remember back when Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was announced; like that was one of the big games on the show floor that everyone wanted to actually play. And if you go to Capcom's booth, you had to wait forever to get to it; everyone was swarming it.
