I played about two and a half hours last night, beefed up six and a half seven hours in Zimo about three hours. Zimo, yeah. Can see Tim how many hours have you played? You're a piece of garbage; play that game, but I want to know what you guys think: is it worth it? Is it cool? Should I play it? That's always the question that's always a hard question. The \"should you play a game\" blanket is tough because it always depends on what you like in a game and this and that and the other. The fact that you're not interested in it, I would say no don't play it for me; it is I am in love; I have; I am addicted. I just it's one of those things where it's like God can the day end?

You know, I've fallen through the world, Brendan fell through the world last night. Like there's little things like that. You know, on launch night I had about an hour where I couldn't connect, but that was you know typical for a launch game which sucks to say but is also better than it could have been. I once I got there and the air code popped up, I'm like well guess I'm not playing this tonight, but an hour later it corrected. I was like okay cool. So for me it's what I wanted which is awesome cuz I feel like Firewatch was that first game I was super psyched about coming out and then I got it and I played it and it wasn't what I wanted and I was like oh that sucks.

But they did pay attention to the thing about that game is that that I did respect about it is that they the side quests didn't feel the same, none of them did. Like, there were actual stories like to every side quest, and like, there was a narrative-driven focus in the game that The Division seems to lack. Like, I went on a bounty hunt, and like, they I was chasing some woman, and and she had lieutenants and stuff, and all I'm like, I don't know, like why I'm even fighting this woman at all; I'm going to kill her, but she did something to someone.

Even though... But it's the weird thing, like you know, Ubisoft had \"girlfriend mode\" right?
