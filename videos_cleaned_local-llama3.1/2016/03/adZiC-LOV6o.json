Um, so I think that they know that, and I think they have something to prove. And um, you know, I'm excited to see uh what it plays like, and I'm also excited to see as we've talked about in the past, I do think that Supermassive's with Until Dawn out of Quantic Dream, Quantic Dream, um, in many ways, and I think that they if they're smart, they'll swallow their pride and look at newer ways to make narrative-based choice-based games like that uh that are a little more dynamic and a little more playable. Um, because I don't think anyone's going to say that Heavy Rain was the most playable game in the world; it was just it was so good that we overlooked a lot of the mechanical shortcomings of it.

Studio Dambuster is the one that's doing this one in the UK; the game takes place in Philadelphia, which I think is a really cool setting. I can't think of a single game that takes place in Philadelphia, um, so I like that setting. It also I think is a connection to the American Revolution and kind of an origin story similar to Rocky Legends, thank you. That takes place in Philadelphia; that's a good point. Um, I like the contained open-world nature of the game. The original Homefront was short; the campaign was short. They obviously ran out of time and had a lot of internal dissension when they were making the game, so the campaign was only about 5 hours long, but there was this moment, these moments of like weird greatness in the game.",

Um, or uh, you know, uh, you're fighting um just in the streets or across like a bridge... and I don't know. It was I liked it - it was hokey and weird. It reminded me a lot of Red Dawn, you know? That John Milius was involved in some way with the game. Um, but this particular one takes more of a step-by-step approach in terms of like you're going to take over this part of the city, and then you're going to do these side quests, and you have to destroy these cameras and these patrols, and do all these things... and play it like it's a Far Cry.",

Uh, I saw it twice. I know it has its issues because of how close it is to the first film, but I didn't care; I enjoyed it. My family's a big fan of Star Wars - my daughters who love Star Wars and they really liked Rey and Finn everywhere I go, they're asking for Rey and Finn stuff.

XIII was very constrained, it was very linear, it was very... which one, the first one? First one, which and and and you know, XIII was just like, oh God, like I I I just... and what was such a shame about that was that the battle system was actually really cool - like it has things about the Paradigm shifting and stuff was cool, I like that idea. And it was just like, it was such a waste - like that game was just so uneven. And um, I just didn't like it.

I mean, I think it's so clearly such an amazing game that I'm interested in seeing what Tacoma can do if they can do it again - if they can make a game that's as good or even better than Gone Home, as opposed to something like Firewatch.

I want a true 3D Zelda with no waggle controls, you know what I mean, and like that looks like what this is going to be from the limited glimpses we have. But again, that's good - I don't want too much, just get it out and put it on the NX at launch. Yep, X is going to give it to you. Yeah, I didn't even include any NX games, and it's funny because I just consider Zelda an NX game; I don't even think of it as a Wii U game. So yeah, yeah - obviously I'm excited for that.
