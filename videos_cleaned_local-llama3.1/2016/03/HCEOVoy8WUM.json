But the second thing is, like I just want to say I want to make it clear I don't want to come out and sound like \"oh woe is me\" - I have to deal with all this punishment. You want to know what? At least on Twitter, the overwhelming majority of my admittedly very small following - everybody follows me - has been saying, \"I totally disagree with your score.\" But you know what that's cool, man? Like, you made your points, and like, to me, that just makes me happy.

Um, but I remember, and I didn't know at the time, I had no idea because I always tried to keep my reviews separate from what other people were saying about games when I'm reviewing them or when I was because I didn't want to like have that seep in - I didn't want to know what anyone else thought.

What's going on where they're like, \"Hey, who's reviewing this?\" Here's a check. I think it was so ridiculous that Marty SLA... uh, who knows if someone else said this before, but the first time I heard it said was Marty saying this in the office sometime last year, I think.

God forbid we come to the most logical and basic conclusion, which is that this is how the person felt about the video game. It's a bad video game. That's like, it's a video game. There are games, but I guess I just think differently, and I think a lot of people actually think the way I do.

I think also part of it is, what makes it a more extreme scale than it would seem like it would be, because you think with that 100-point scale there's a lot of nuance there right, like there's there's a as opposed to a five or a 10-point scale, there's all these gray areas that you could position your opinion in and yet the there's this other problem of uh the 100 point scale which is that invokes at least here in you know for us in our country uh in the United States um maybe less so other places but for us it definitely invokes the school grading system",
