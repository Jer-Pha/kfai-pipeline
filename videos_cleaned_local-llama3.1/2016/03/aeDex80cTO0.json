And that was essentially like my first paid hosting job uh way back when I got paid $25 a day to do that show yeah I was super excited about it I was like yeah my first job but coming out of college you know like you kind of have to take any opportunity you can which is why I had to have like five jobs at one point in Los Angeles to pay rent and buy gas and things like that so after that I knew that I really wanted to go the hosting route and not really do journalism which is why when people ask me like oh you know do you call yourself a journalist",

But I was like I was hooked, like after that incident I was like how do I make this a thing? Only work in games cuz I just have loved doing it for so long. So after that I kind of took random odd jobs here and there hosting for a variety of different shows. I did like a a travel show, I did an Internet dating game show, I did this weird uh like foodie show where we would go to new restaurants and like interview chefs. And you can't really find any of this online cuz I don't think it's posted anywhere on YouTube that'll never take off, yeah exactly.

I think that's really important. I think practice, practice, practice - practice reading if you want to host on camera, grab a magazine or a book and just read it out loud and like practice reading it in different ways and figuring out why it sounds different and just little things like that um are super important and now with the way that you know online digital",
