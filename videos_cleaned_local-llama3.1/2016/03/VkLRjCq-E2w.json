Yeah, I read about it. I don't care though. Do you not follow Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson on Instagram? Just right now I'm following him. I was messing up bad man, dude. You're missing great Instagrams he does. Little bits when he introduces characters, he curses; he's got a cute dog, the other one died. The Rock and Zac Efron in a Baywatch movie - that's going to be awesome. Yeah, he looks great. I'm excited.
