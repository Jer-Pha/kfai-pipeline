Topic: To leave your questions and we'll get to them at some point, just like we're doing right now with a Morton Joe. He says Amigos, read the whole thing. How are you? My question is simple. We talk all the time about games that make us sad, happy, laugh or cry, but if you ever played a game or came across something in a game that has offended you, don't think so. That's offended me, yeah, oh definitely. Like what? All of GTA 5, really. Really listen, I'm in a camp that I don't play GTA anymore. The one GTA that I went all in on was Vice City, but now I just like I started it and I had to stop. But I just I couldn't deal with it's just not it's just not for me. It's just like I get that a lot of video games have violence, I play violent games myself, but like the way GTA handles it, I just I just don't like just don't like it. So it's the violence of it, like what like Trevor and he's hitting",

And again, it's because they hide them. You're cut through the right well, that's what we're talking about, right? Not like those Epic Skyrim loading screens that you whole time playing, right? Yeah, so I think like yeah, it's a simple question. The thing about it is, like, is you know load exists because of how big the game is, right, and how competent the machine is. But when the machine gets better, the games get bigger; that's the whole thing. You're not going to ever see it go away because they're always going to be chasing each other. Yeah, yeah. I think it's just about hiding it properly, and not you know like Bloodborne's a great example. I know that they patched it and made it better, but when Bloodborne came out the load times in Bloodborne were absurd; like, it wasn't even long or like I was like you could",

Yeah, a game like that was really for what I thought was a pretty great game - I was like that's insane, I mean I couldn't believe the load times and that so it is unimmersive. Rise of the Tomb Raider did really well, their loads were quick if you died you instantly were right back in it. Mhm, so back in the day, like before CD games, like all the cart-based stuff, there was no loading at all, right? Was there any cart game that had loading? No, I can think of yeah but we're never going back there unless Nintendo brings it back with the NX um give it next question comes",

They've put second-party Sony-published games on PC, but none of the first-party ones so until that happens, until you see an Uncharted or a God of War or a Bloodborne or something like that on PC, we're not going to know we're not going to have like an apples-to-apples comparison between the consoles. But I my assumption is it's not going to affect it as much as people think yeah I don't think it's going to affect it at all but it is important to note that you know uh Rise of the Tomb Raider sold way, way better on PC so um it could just say that that game's",

Mhm I'll I'll be interested to see the Quantum Break numbers. Clint Miss says hey guys, I have a question about YouTube and creating content around games. I know you've covered the subject before on Game of Thrones show, but I was hoping that you might go into more detail specifically when it comes to making content for YouTube setting it around video games. I have high-quality videos on my channel of me let's playing games; they hardly get any views. I spend a lot of time in the description title tags etc., I just don't see any results. I thought this was interesting with you here, how do you how do we make content around video games for other people? The first step if you're on YouTube is to read the Creator",

The first step if you're on YouTube is to read the Creator Playbook. First Step number one: just Google 'Creator Playbook' and read it front to back. I think it's just youtube.com/Playbook - don't skip any sections like in, make sure you're doing all of the best practices that they outline there, that's step number one. Mhm. Step number two is making a niche audience. Right now it's too difficult to do everything - you have to pick something and stick with it and be the best of that one thing. There's just way too much saturation with people trying to be like 'I'm going to do a generic gaming channel' - it's like, you and a million other people doing that. So pick like your favorite thing, the thing that you can spend the most amount of time with and won't get sick of, and you love, whether it be Minecraft or Call of Duty or you know Destiny or whatever your game of choice is.\"",

Go get some candy; bring the jelly beans in. So, oh, they're here. God damn it, Kevin, I love that guy. Oh, and there he goes dropping the beans. Final final question of this one, this one's for you. I was curious as to why Pixel Art in games is so expensive and difficult to use. I've looked online and haven't really been able to find a thorough explanation as to exactly why this is. Having played Super Mario World in Pixel Perfect mode on the new Nintendo 3DS, I've come to appreciate the beauty of the game even more now than I did when it originally came out. That was from Popcorn Shower. Wait, you mean like, like buying the art assets? No, like making them.",

It's way more expensive to make pixel art than it is for Street Fighter, we're always talking about 3D games, like Vania and stuff, e.g., Vanillaware is even 2.5D. So, there's multiple reasons why a game like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, which I think is one of the most beautiful games of all time, like easily, um, these are so beautifully animated. These enemies or characters, you know, Alucard for instance, or Dracula, are animated uh frame by frame with pixel art, so it's, it has to be done by hand basically, and uh, it's super expensive. The other thing that EA was saying to me, which is interesting, when you know, cuz we I've talked to Electronic Arts many times about Bloodstained, which I'm super excited about, um, is that there's just not that many people anymore that can do it and do",
