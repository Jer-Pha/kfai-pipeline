Great to be back, good to have you back, great to be back. It's been too long since you sat behind that microphone, beard all close to it. Oh yeah, over there, the P Tim Gettys let Tim host, thanks for that Nick. Over there, the pride of Long Island, Colore Yardi go Islanders, and then right here, the one and only Mike Drucker hi everybody, yeah I'm on camera everyone knows Mike Drucker, I assume every but for the few who don't. Mike Drucker has had an illustrious career; he wrote for Nintendo, made some of your games you love out there, he wrote up at noon for a long time until he was poached by some hack named Jimmy Fallon who took him to late night to The Tonight Show. Now you write for The Tonight Show, that's right, that's awesome how weird is that it's very weird it's very weird there are days when I still like there are days when I don't",

Yeah, no, you never have the realization that I imagine got to get out of bed at 10:30 exactly, like working at IGN. It's just ex- like, cuz when you were there, so just to bring everyone up, Drucker was the one and well, I guess Alan wrote a little bit on it, but at first, you were the only writer at first, I was the only sort of comedy writer right off and noon, and this is back when we were doing all the start stuff, and we brought you in, and we were like, \"Cool, you're a writer; yeah, take care of the entire thing,\" and then, and this is like a 30-minute show that we you, you were basically in charge of writing.",

I could be wrong, and I don't want to be wrong, but I think it's something like 42 weeks. So maybe we get 10 weeks off, and maybe more, maybe less. Okay, and so what is that?
