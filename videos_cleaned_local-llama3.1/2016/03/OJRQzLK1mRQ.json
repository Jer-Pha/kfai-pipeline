Like we're talking about this console handheld hybrid thing and it's so normal I mean it is, that's pretty easy to wrap your head around. This is like why like what's I don't even understand what the thought process was. What you think the handheld Switch controller would look like, I don't know, could be something more similar to a 3DS with like grips or something. I thought it would have buttons, oh you know that buttons. Look at the huge critical and commercial success the Wii U gamepad was, it has buttons Greg.

What do you mean real games? Maybe that's a whole topic for another time but I think games that are developed specifically for mobile devices work really well on the mobile platform and Nintendo has shown that they are leaders in innovation in many different categories so maybe they've made something that you just haven't thought about yet, that's true, true but these are the people that made the Wii U and that did all that stuff so or and the Wii which",

But there's they are putting out toys for people, and I don't mean that that is not me taking a jab at them. I'm saying that they take chances on the Wii U and its waggle on the pad on these different things, and they want you to experience their toys in a very specific way, a very interesting way, and I'm interested to see what they do. I still stand by that just like with the Wii U and just like with the Wii; they started deviating because they can't compete with Xbox and PlayStation on what they're doing let alone PC, and this this of course though falls into the same trap that Colin's always talking about where my argument becomes that they're this toy manufacturer, they're putting out this toy; they're going to still have awesome Mario Zelda Metroid games for it.",
