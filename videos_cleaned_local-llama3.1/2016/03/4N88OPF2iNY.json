And that happens to a lot of marathon runners; um, they'll go, that's why marathon runners tend to be really, really skinny because after a certain point, they've burned through all the fat and all the carbohydrates that are in their system, and their body goes, \"I need something else. I need something else. Let's take muscle. Let's burn that.\" I once wrote a maximum Maxim article about this marathon runner, and he would get pizzas delivered to him while I ran; yeah, you got that?
