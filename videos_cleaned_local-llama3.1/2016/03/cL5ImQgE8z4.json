I need something else. Let's take muscle. Let's burn that.\" I once wrote an article about this for Maxim, a marathon runner who would get pizzas delivered to him while he ran. Yeah, you got that? That's the life. So I started doing that just not without the running but so to your point, that's awesome, that's great. No, I'm glad you got one part of it down and that's what I would tell you, Tim.

Yeah, I mean that's a salad with healthy greens and protein on top of it, and you...what happened? You lost weight, but you probably feel better. So that's the thing - I don't feel better really in terms of like cutting that stuff out; the feeling better comes from after the excruciating pain of running and like doing **** it's the day after everything hurts a little bit, but then it's the day after that where I'm like, huh, I feel better. I definitely feel better, and that pains me to say because I wish that wasn't true.

I can walk forever, and then pick if you want to pick one day a week or two days a week where you try something a little harder. But I can tell you this: when it comes to lifting or any of those more like uh aerobic or anaerobic style exercises, they get easier the more you do them exactly. And that's and then you get the appreciation for going, \"Oh man, I couldn't lift that last week but I can lift it this week.\" That's weird; am I feeling better or do I just have what are these muscles right?

And one of the things they say is you know um the conventional wisdom of uh low-fat high carb diets is being challenged right now largely because if you look at the obesity rate in our country or actually in the world, it's not decreasing, it's rapidly increasing and a large portion of that a lot of people contribute that to the fact that people tend to eat too many carbs they tend to overeat carbs it tends to be the things that when you think oh man I'm I'm so I just want something good what is it that you think burrito something that's good right and so a",
