We didn't even have any sales going on; we did have some sales around Christmas time, like everybody else, yeah. Um, but and so we couldn't quite reach that level because everyone goes crazy around that time. But uh, in January, we were outpacing ourselves week after week. In November, we were outpacing ourselves week after week. So it's pretty good so far this month. Um, in February, we're also doing better week after week. So the fact that it's happening eight months after the release of the game is the most encouraging thing about it. Because one of the one of the misnomers about coming out on something like PlayStation Plus is well now you're out; you've given your game to millions of people, and now you have no opportunity to make any money.

And that, and that's that's why you have to stand behind your game and you have to hope that you reach a point where you're ready to let it go because if if first of all if you ask most game developers they never want to let their game go because there's always something that they want to add to it and wait just need this this many more features.

This so the exciting thing about this year I thought it'd be too um uh disingenuous for me to list Rocket League as one of my five favorite games looking forward to 2016 but since the topic is Rocket League this year we have a lot of big plans for the game, uh, and we're going to continue to add new modes which I think are really going to go over well some of them are things that folks have been asking for for quite a long time first person shooter mode no first person shooter mode at least not yet not in the first half if that's something that we can actually get to work properly uh we first have to figure it out and then try it but um the the amount of stuff that we have coming, we think are",

And then the stuff that you want to sell is just to keep the lights on. And then they're aware that that's just for fun. None of our DLC is ever an advantage, either - it's all just stuff you think looks cool. So we think that's important with the Xbox release: are you looking at that as exciting? Like, does it feel like a whole new kind of deal for the thing, or is it just like another one? It doesn't.

Yeah, man, so when dialing back to when it comes out on PlayStation Plus, which is just its initial release, when did you guys realize that maybe this was different than like it was going to beat expectations or something was happening here?

At the same time, we just frantically tried to get as many servers as we could. The fact is, a lot of them didn't exist; we had to have them built on top of it. We're having these servers built and adding all this new net code - it was nuts!

Like watching play styles evolve over time in the beginning, it was people rushing the ball and trying to score, and then people started realizing they could do aerials, and then they did, and so you saw aerial play take over, and then turtling - which is where you're on your back, that sort of thing - took over when people started realizing how they could do that. And now you're seeing a trend towards freestyling, where people are just doing crazy things in the air before scoring uh, and so it's really interesting to see the audience evolve and the skill level evolve and what's taking what sort of form is overtaking on the competitive scene and the",

Final thing comes from Dubor, he says no question just a thank you for helping make Rocket League the game is awesome, thank you our pleasure. And I have a I have a quick one of the things I'm interested in and I talked about this a little bit and people poed me in the right directions but people have developed into Goal Tenders in the game right like that like people play goalie in the game which I think is like so funny It's So Glamorous yet like so essential and it's incredibly important yeah and then that's sort of what's that that's one of the elements of the game that is uh truly uh organic about it is that the roles aren't assigned we're not we don't tell people you're a goalie and you're forward and and you're a wingman",
