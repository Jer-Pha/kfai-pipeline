Everything we've heard about uh everything we've heard positions PlayStation 4K as a machine capable of playing current and Next Generation Ultra HD media while also offering support for other aspects of the 4K spec, such as high dynamic range and a wider color gamut. Aspects of the 4K spec that could be introduced to gaming, however, in terms of additional computational power, we've got to be realistic about what Sony can deliver with a mid-generation refresh.

Wouldn't launching another $400 device the following year further drive people away from buying PSVR if they felt the new console would be more valuable to them? I love to hear your thoughts on the topic. We're assuming by the way that it's $400, and I bet you it's more than that. Oo uh now this is a huge mistake. I don't understand why they're doing this. Luxury items, bruh. They are messing with the momentum of a system that is selling meteorically. They are going to confuse the marketplace. They were all about one thing, remember? They were all about it, and now suddenly they're not about it. What worked for them isn't going to work for them anymore. What they're finding is that probably publishers are going to them and as proxies for their developers and being like \"we\"",

I'm not even sure, like VR certainly needs more power, but I wonder if like Ubisoft and EA and Activision are going to be like \"we're going to need more\" soon because the games your systems are going to hold our games back from PC, from like what they can run on PC, and we're going to have problems with that. So I think there's something to that, there's obviously something to the GPU uh processing of of PSVR as well because of how the game has to be rendered and stuff, but I think they're making a huge mistake, like I I I I just I hope I'm wrong because Microsoft's doing the same thing and I don't want either of them to really make a mistake with this it seems like",

That I would see you going to doce it and go up, you go up from where you are right now at 350 to 400 again, and be like, \"Hey, we're raising the price, but you're getting more, and it's going to last you longer, and this, that, and the other.\" Yeah, I feel like how I mean, how much higher do you think it would go?

Because you get games that are you know eight hours, and that should be a very different price point than maybe the 25-hour experience. Um, it's a tough problem. And you know when you look at a movie experience, you're dropping you know $30 on a really nice IMAX movie with plush chairs and free popcorn. Uh, but that's a 2-hour experience.
