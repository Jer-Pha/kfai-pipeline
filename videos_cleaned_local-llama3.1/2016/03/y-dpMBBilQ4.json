Like, well, we got shut down so we have to do something. This is a new thing. We wiped the slate clean and started at Ground Zero and built it up yes. And the other thing to keep in mind is that I cannot write checks that I can't cash. But like, that also doesn't necessarily mean it's just us you know?

You know, you have forever to cash in because the people who love you are gonna love you, but I think that you just need to come out and be like, 'Here's what we're doing again,' here's what you guys want, you know, get what you want. My rough goal right now is before March is over, you'll know what it's called, like, you'll have a name out there, will have a directive, you know?
