It's not like I'm asking you to wash Grandma Miller's soiled undergarments by hand because she doesn't want them to get frayed by the new fangled washing machine. Old people are weird, is that I mind being here for a friend? It's just when he gets in these moods, I sort of feel like we're enabling him. Look, Colin is my best friend in the whole wide world; Nick, you're next, then Tim. Kevin is a very distant fourth. A man, this is a hard day for Colin. It's the only 24-hour period in the entire year when not one single sporting event is taking place. The last time this happened, I found him in the basement simming games of NHL '94 on his SNES; he was going number one into empty mayonnaise jars and humming the theme song to \"Degrassi High.\" Damn, that's low. I love Degrassi. What do you want, hi Colin? It's me, Greg, your best friend. I didn't",

Come on, just one goal for your boy Colin. Sweet Jeff, John's in the sky. It's worse than I thought. No icing, no icing. Oh, he's clearly offside. You missed that pass at the point. We'll get through this game, and the Russians won't stand a chance. Tarez, tarez will show us the way. Oh, we've got to do something to break the trance. Why don't we just go down there and turn it off? I wish it was that simple. His mind and the 1990s computing power of the SNES have become one; killing one could cause irreparable damage to the other. I have an idea, Greg. Let me see your microphone. Do you carry that mic around with you at all times? Duh, does Wiz Khalifa carry",
