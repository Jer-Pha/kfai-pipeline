You get the tour, and it's always like, \"This is the art pod,\" and this is the pod, and there are all these people working that you never get a chance to say thank you to. So I wanted it to be somebody that I'd never said thank you to before. Or, full disclosure, this is a funny story \u2013 I only tell people off-camera; this is exclusive. Originally, I had ALS... I'd beaten Tomb Raider, and I had just platinumed Batman: Arkham Knight. So I went through Arkham Night, picked somebody, and I was like, \"Oh great, I did the same thing.\" Kind of let the credits roll, and I looked up, picked somebody, and I checked her Twitter \u2013 she'd just won a BAFTA. And I was like, \"I can't say that development is a thankless job\"",

There was nothing else you could play on a console that had a world that big, pardon me, that many yeah, get me getting me emotional, um no, that had a world that big that had that many stats, skills, mechanics to track and and and think about. Um, nothing was as sophisticated as like when when Phantasy Star II came out on the Genesis, there was like no video game on because I didn't play PC games at the time so like there was no game video game available that was even close to the size depth or breadth of Phantasy Star II. Now in the day and age of of like say Persona 4 you know Golden or when Persona 5 comes out you know this year you know Persona 5 I I'm sure I will love it my whole heart but it's missed the opportunity that no, that we are past the point in in time in video game",

I'm sure I will love it with my whole heart, but it's missed the opportunity that now we're past the point in time in video game development where a JRPG \u2013 what comes with that territory is that it's just way bigger, more complex, and richer than any other kind of game out there. Like now we have action games that exist in an open world; we have shooters that exist in an open world; we have other RPGs that exist in a totally open world. There's no way in which a traditional by the numbers JRPG can dwarf other genres in terms of size and sophistication anymore, not because they've gotten less sophisticated but because all the other genres have become more so. And so that inherent edge doesn't exist. So when you... I guess what I'm saying is I agree with you \u2013 like Persona 4 is a masterful JRPG, easily in my opinion in the top 10 of all time. Um, but it's very hard for me to allow it to eclipse games like Final Fantasy.",

M of what's left there's a lot left, you're saying like Street Fighter V for you oh no that's that's what I'm saying is it's not that there's nothing big coming out it's that this year similar to last year actually like was front-loaded with games that I was looking forward to so like last year it was Evolve and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, that I was like frothing at the mouth to have in my life you know what I mean like this year it was Street Fighter V, XCOM 2, and Darkest Dungeon were",

So uh, you know many props for you do have an amazing command of the written word. Thank you so much. You were very well spoken. I I told you to give you even more compliments. I told you this when it happened but uh go look at IGN's Game of the Year video when we gave or when they when you gave uh Last of Us the game of the year video. I remember I shot you doing your whole spiel and like the way that you spoke about that game was just it was an art to itself, and I was so impressed by just the emotion that you had talking about it, and it was it was awesome.
