So year after year, like things video games just kind of evolve and get bigger and bigger and bigger, and what is it that we we kind of demand to come from these games? It's me, yeah, it's your question. Um, so it's just I mean I think actually I emailed you guys about this like six years ago on Beyond or something because I was just trashed. I think you actually called me out on the show and said \"stop writing such long **** emails and just keep making movies.\" Shut up. Um, I just I always like I I think I like versatility and I like um variety in any media of entertainment, and you know I think games are only getting healthier and healthier as we move along. But I've been I was used to be frustrated my entire life because games were a medium where they tried to copy movies for so long, they tried to copy TV for so long, and they tried to",

And they have attributes of none of those have you know like music and films and books and games all can do something better than any of those other mediums can do in telling a story and connecting people and experiences and communicating with people. And I always wanted games to uh at least have a place where they could just drop you into people's experiences, you know it wasn't really about the end game it wasn't about anything too dramatic it was just about an experience you could share and you could let someone else you know either walk in your shoes or have your options and then kind of what would you do you know like how would you tackle this situation um Emily is Away was like one of those ones from last year for me, like really simple not necessarily",

I was always thinking but just something where it's really simple, really small, but you're in that you know totally in that moment and you can connect so many aspects of that. Um, and I always want games to get to that point and I feel they're pushing more and more towards that now. You know, you get things like Far Cry: New Dawn and you get things like Gone Home, and sure there's still a large level of for one better word gaminess and you know over-dramatization to them. Um, but um it just I'm finding everything's just so oversaturated at the moment and I'm old now, so it's kind of yeah it's it's like well I'm drawn then to like Far Cry which I had huge problems with but I'm drawn to that because it's a small pocket exactly and it's something like you you like you can get through that.",

But I'm losing my train of thought now. No, you're right there because you were talking about it even in the last topic, right? You're getting older so what you want out of a game, what you demand from a game changes. Yeah, whereas with The Division, you're like, \"I should love this.\" Well, yeah, no exactly. And I still want those big open world games and I still want immersion, but I want more personality and I just expect more from a video game now. Like it's when I part of my problem with Far: Watch is honestly it's some of the writing and it's the opening which everybody loves, I actually think it's garbage.

It felt unfinished to me, which um from some interviews I then heard seemed valid. Um, but yeah, honestly, I could I could live with that if it was superbly well written. Got um and I just find the older I get and the more the games start to nudge towards yeah we can do these other things that are more interesting; it's not just about little game loop and it's not just about you know mechanic.

I should say, but that's the thing - there's more and more games, and there were more and more increasingly exhaustive qualities, like the effort and time and money and talent that goes into these things is extraordinary. And yeah, I'm less and less impressed for some reason every year. I think it's the investment of the games nowadays. I don't think that it's necessarily that there's more out there that are part of the conversation because, like you think back to the PS2 GameCube Xbox era - like to me, and again I was in that was when I was in middle school high school so it's like that was the perfect time for me to be able to play everything.

Like sometimes with games, it's hard to even know what the game is, how do you beat this game, you know, or is it just something you just play and experience? And I think, but that's what games are more so now than they've ever been, it's like you don't beat games, you just kind of play them until you're done. Play until you're done, I think. I think that that I mean I agree with you in a sense, like that's actually... I mean I'm being POS but it's true, it's like some of these games beat me, I'm like **** this, you know, I can't...

And uh, so I look at these games now, and I'm like I understand that perspective, but I do think it's overwhelming gaming culture where it's like well how big is it? You know, like the value is is garnered from how big the game is Ganos is $20 whatever, but Ganon's experience is worth $60 in my opinion. Like that game is an hour and a half long, and you can never play it again, but it's way more resonant than almost anything I've played in the last few years. And so that kind of thing is in the eye of the beholder where I'm like well we look at these experiences I'm not saying we should pay $60 for Ganon what I'm saying is that you know why do we look at this and be like well is it is it big is it's not worth $60 because it's",

And yeah, you do see it very much in games like Metro, Wolfenstein, and now like well, yes, I mean Choice-driven development making choices like that.
