And like that that game was really kind of uh um a really nice presentation piece for the PS2 back then when it was like that's a game that looked awesome - people would come over and see it and be like, \"Damn, video games are crazy.\" Now you know Gran Turismo 3 was like the real example of that, but that was way too hardcore for me. I rented that and I'm like uhuh not for me. I cruised around my PT Cruiser for a bit. Oh wow, yeah, wow - you're right there. I was like",

Um, and I think that the fact that you were YOU in the game instead of some random guy from Skate Video - I've never heard of exactly Bob, you haven't been on Jackass yet, I know who you are, yeah. And also all the Jackass elements, I think that's when it really started to introduce a lot of things that we saw Tony Hawk for being like hinted at, um. And yeah, that's very interesting, Greg. Thank you, I like to interest you once in a while. It's I think that there's probably an example of a game or games in every genre that that I wouldn't typically like, but like the games - Racing's a good example, I mean um but more in an arcadey sense, like I really love",

Like, I'm kind of reformed from that genre because there actually has been a game probably since let us cling together on PSP or like Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and Advance 2 where I'm like, \"I even played them.\" You did you play any of the Disgaea games? Yeah, Disgaea. Yeah, so Disgaea doesn't do it for me either for multiple reasons. The stacking is really weird in that game. I don't understand these like these super ridiculous damage numbers.
