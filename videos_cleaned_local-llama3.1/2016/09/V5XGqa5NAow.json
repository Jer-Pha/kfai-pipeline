Have you been to Yosemite? Oh yeah, my mom is a hippie from the Bay Area. Yeah, I've been to like 13; she brought me there when I was 13.

And that was the only one that showed up. The deer couldn't make it from Florida. Yeah, I was pretty bad. Um, I've been camping way, way, way more times than I would have ever liked to. Probably three or four times camping. I got to imagine you hate it. Oh, it's the yeah, it's the absolute worst. Nothing about it is like Tim; this is a selling point for you. All of it's horrible.

Uh, let's slow the story down a little bit and I need you to start from at least the midway point so what did Kevin do, commune with a raccoon like what happened? Yeah, so his mom left the sliding door open, like a little one of those just to let some air in when they smoked. Raccoons can just kind of... oh this little guy got in there; they can open it, I mean they have we hear some noises and this is back in the you know Jackass days early Tim days where I'm just running around with a handheld cam at all times obviously this thing has night vision so I turn the night vis on 'cause I hear some stuff and I like go to",

You just got it leaving. That's not what was playing; the thing that got accidentally erased was so funny. Yours is wrong, absolutely not. On that same trip, I fed a squirrel for a really long time - fat squirrel. There's a video of that to this day. He was so big, like an endless bag of potato chips. It's Kevin, always next... there was another time in fifth grade when we went on our like fifth-grade camping trip or whatever.

Me and all my friends went out because one of them was like, \"Let's go camping; it's going to be so much fun.\" It absolutely wasn't. Except we all brought our Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and we hadn't played Yu-Gi-Oh for years at that point. We all ended up playing that all night. It was pitch black outside. So that time was kind of fun, kind of, but I still don't want to do it again. We can't... We had a pop-up camper that you put on the back of Dad's truck, you know?

There's a lot of these stories have been told tangentially; I'm going to have to get that one later. Once we took the pop-up camper down to the Steam Show Sandwich Fair and then that's where I ate too much Cherry Pie and vomited into a bucket while sitting in the back of the pop-up camper.
