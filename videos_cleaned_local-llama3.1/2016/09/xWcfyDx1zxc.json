But what I'm saying is like they humanize their own people, they just talk so much crap, and they've all unraveled in their own way. And it's been a pleasure frankly to watch. Anthony Weiner is the reason Anthony Weiner did get his comeuppance, not because of his politics.

I think that's the start of that if somebody's asking for it or you have a relationship with them, that are that's acceptable, then yes. Otherwise, absolutely not in no way, shape, or form. So I mean, two, it sounds like these are not consensual. No, these are consensual. Oh, he was having a sexting relationship that these girls - girls outside Langley finals on Facebook. When you're married, absolutely not. This is it, also the cautionary tale of like you just can't try.
