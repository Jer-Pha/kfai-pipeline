It's one of the reasons why I was drawn to Human Revolution originally just because I like the style of it, and I was like, \"Oh, I want to kind of...\" every once in a while I'll jump into a game that I know I'm going to be in for like you know 10 to 20 hours.

And granted I was playing a little bit further into your save, did they address that in your opinion? Uh well the controls are completely different okay so you can actually right when it starts it asks you if you want to do the new control scheme or the Human Revolution scheme and pick the new one it's it's much better. Uh largely because I think uh if I remember correctly in Human Revolution you had to click in one of the sticks to aim and that was the worst.

So I I I respect that restraint that they've not like, they're definitely taking a very deliberate um move into the space and figuring out what works. And I think with Mii too, I think they probably got data that's important to them in some respect um from a free-to-play model. And so as we said here it's a one-time pay kind of thing. And I think now they're going to get important data from their biggest IP uh about how people jump in if they just have to pay one time.

You're the boyfriend; you go off on a Saga journey to find or whatever. It plays like a JRPG with RPG battles and vinyl records. You wear hipster outfits and weaponized Panda plushies. I like the map exactly awesome. And then there's this thing now, here's where it gets better, Tim - mhm? V PlayStation 4, Steam; we were going to ask, \"Where are the V games?\" Yeah, exactly. No, no. Now I've harassed the Y2K creator online before, and he's been delayed recently because of some stuff with his mom, so we hope everything's all right with that. Finish the game when you're ready; it still looks awesome. This is an old trailer as well - you know, you look at the other trailer, see how old that trailer is?
