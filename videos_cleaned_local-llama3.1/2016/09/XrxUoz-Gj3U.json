Run me through what they did to the direct cuz I heard about the direct but we were at PAX, we on the way to we were doing something when the we traveling to PAX happened like right right before announce a bunch of 3DS games whole bunch of stuff happened yes so we got uh I was going to work backwards and start with the the Apple stuff my apologies I was trying to be a good co-host keep convers let me go I'm going to go down though my not because we got all",

The Legend of Zelda and TLoZ: Ocarina of Time in a dual pack from Wind Waker, all of these available December 2nd, and they will have uh compatibility with NX Breath of the Wild when it comes out next year, yeah. Um, and the Wii U in bad news this is from the direct but in similar um anniversary fashion Metroid Prime: Federation Force sold fewer than 5,000 copies in Japan, damn yeah who would have called it? In Japan that Greg's loud, damn was over there, yeah okay but still it's selling poorly everywhere not a huge surprise the game's not supposed to be that bad.

I think I still am confident we're going to see a Metroid game on NX at or near launch, yeah. Uh, then there you know Dragon Quest talk all that stuff, yeah. Oh, that's whole bunch of them just uh just a little bit of that Dragon Quest talk. Dragon Quest VII is September 16th, yep. Dragon Quest VIII still TBA, yep. Dragon Quest XI still TBA; can't wait for 11. We have I've had I didn't realize seven was so far away because I've had it for like two weeks just sitting there.

Um, but the kind of bad news about it is you can't search for Wii U courses to download. So you could play Wii U courses if you you you play in the the 100 Mario Challenge or whatever it's called okay, where but it's randomized - it's random Wii U things that you're going to be downloading and playing um, but the real draw is that you can create whatever levels you want; you can uh Street Pass with people and send them your courses. You can work on a course, give it to someone else, they they work on it then someone else can play it. Um, but the real draw to me is there's a 100 Nintendo-made courses in the game. Oh nice!

This came out of nowhere. Now I am familiar with Poo from The Simpsons; who is Poochy in the Yoshi universe? He's a dog, made his first appearance in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island on the Super Nintendo. He was in all of the most annoying levels in that game; he's just like the P from The Simpsons, not well designed. Um, his function would be there'd be spikes that you can't touch but he could run on top of them so you kind of get on him and whatever way you're looking he runs. So okay, yeah, thank you U, but the amiibo looks adorable; it's another one of those yarn woolly ones, but it's Poochy. Thanks so I got to be real this seems like the least clamored for amiibo",

Now I'm sure you are, uh, but it is interesting looking at the dates; it goes right up till February, and then the rumor is March is at least the NX's supposed date, when they give it to you. But then Pikmin - they announced a new Pikmin game for the 3DS that's an action scroller that looks awesome. It looks like it uses both of the DS's screens, the top one and bottom one, where you need to kind of interact and use the Pikmin to uh kind of look ahead, and it reminds me a lot of the more experimental titles that went on in the Nintendo DS, not 3DS.

Um, Mario Maker people have been saying since it was announced like where is the 3DS version? So I think we always kind of expected that and I think it was kind of a miss that they didn't get that out sooner. Um, when like the Zeitgeist was still kind of going but there's always going to be a group of people just like smash or something like that; they're always playing it so um well I think the Mario Maker moment has come and gone for mainstream gaming or for um console enthusiasts that are moved on to the next thing.

I think it's on PS4 as well, so uh, it'll get people ready and hyped up, and and and ready to go on those kinds of things as well. Because I really do believe in the Dragon Quest franchise, and and uh, it's one of the few franchises that have really helped firm with with the exception of X and some spin-offs like uh monsters and stuff that to uh really help firm to what makes I think role-playing games fun, which is for some people, which is the grind, which is the the length.",

Those were the biggest announcements for me. But I understand that in the west, that's not really a Dragon Quest isn't really a thing anymore. So yeah, I'm really impressed by the direct overall.

And the fact that it's a Nintendo made game makes me really excited because they obviously obviously have so much polish uh when it comes to their stuff.

It's fun, it's fine, but it's not great. You know, it's not designed for that, and it's definitely not accurate. There are a lot of issues. In contrast, when I played the Rayman game, I felt entirely in control - I knew what I was doing. They designed it around one-handed play. It's targeting December 2016 for release, and it's also coming to Android and iOS. What do you guys think?
