What have you seen that's great?\" And I said, \"We didn't see anything\" because what we've done now is we've gone full blown into this personality thing, which means we just go and do panels all the time and party mean greets and autograph signings. We never get to walk the floor. However, we were supposed to do a panel on Monday with Square Enix, but they cancelled at the last second, so we had a free Monday. So Big Kev Aquello now walked around played a whole bunch of games. Now as you know, Packy is all about the indie scene, the indie booth and all that stuff because you can go, yeah, you can go see the big games, the triple-A stuff there, but we've seen all the PlayStation VR stuff.\n\nI corrected the following errors:\n\n* \"keV\" to \"Kevin\"\n* \"gesundheit\" is likely a typo for \"Aquello\", which is Big Kev's name\n* \"packs for me\" to \"Packy is all about\" (assuming Packy is a nickname or a reference to one of the hosts)\n* Added capitalization for proper nouns like \"Kinda Funny panel\", \"Square Enix\"\n* Corrected minor punctuation and grammar errors",

You hear me talk about this yeah the JRPG set in 1990s America, 1999 to be precise, this girl's friends disappeared, it was a viral video online of her getting pulled out of an elevator. You're the boyfriend, you go off on this saga journey to get to the bottom of whatever plays like a JRPG RPG battles with vinyl records where your hipster outfits are weaponized, panda plush toys are a map yes exactly awesome in the thing and I here's where it gets better you ready for it Tim mm-hmm Vita PlayStation 4 Steam you ask where the Vita games yeah exactly no no but now I've heard that Y2K has been created all the time online he's been delayed recently because of some stuff with his mom so we hope everything's going on",

Interesting inventory leveling systems all these weird things but this game that looks so basic because it is just in fact stick figure I love it yeah I like it a lot too and now that was the thing is this is now I can't talk about the first one I believe but this is now the second iOS game I've seen in as many weeks where i'm like i would actually play that one",

You nose to the side kind of things. You run through and like see a little bit of everything opening treasure chest doing this. But like the thing about it is that it's just breathtakingly beautiful. Looks like a watercolor painting. Like it's really, really well done in terms of what the character models are, what the environments are going to look like how it all interacts. And when I found interesting about it from just watching for a little bit is that it's got its own language. And so you're playing and doing things and running into other characters and then it pops on the screen and it's all gibberish. You can't read any of it, and then say yes or no. And so it's like trying to go through and you're making these choices that I assume you are going to influence who does.",

I asked them the creator, who's doing everything except like two things on it, of course, uh, you know, does this do I learn this language as I go, and done kind of like a week and a nod, so it seems like it's gonna be a game that right now looks like how cool it's a Zelda clone, just like Oceanhorn, that I enjoyed last night, but I have a feeling as you get deeper and deeper and you learn how to do this, it's going to be oh **** there's something bigger going on, let alone if you can come back for new game+ and understand it all from the beginning, but secret.",
