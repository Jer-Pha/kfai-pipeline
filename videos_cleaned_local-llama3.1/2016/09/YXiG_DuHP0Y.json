The Witcher 3 is open world, obvious right, that's a single-player campaign but yes exactly yeah. Doom, I would definitely put on that list, um, Doom's a good example of it.

You guys are always worth a dollar, Chuck. Thanks. Yeah, I mean, um, I can understand you're being upset about it, but I also think this is incorrect me if I'm wrong, Colin, because I we I guess we don't know, but I it would not surprise me if the two hands there in motion didn't know what the other people were doing. I I mean, I know how some organizations are run, and it is broken up; this is similar, but I don't think it was like on their mustache. We're going to get these **** people.

You just kind of have to accept it, I think, or you just have to be really judicious. But I don't think you can avoid it. You know? But I don't think what was done was intentional.

I think for them to be like, \"we need to find a manufacturer of these like ancient ships that are like 25 years past even being relevant.\" We have to find all these things. I think the irony of that is that like we would think at first blush when I would think about that would be cheap and easy money for them to make, but then I was like no it would actually be probably more expensive than the NES now than it did in 1985. Um, sorry, no so I but Nostalgia is such a powerful thing that even if they weren't going to release the hardware, the software does surprise me and the company that I'm surprised doesn't do this the most is Sega, like I think that they they have nothing but banking on their old games now as they recuperate.",

Final question of the day comes from wet dirt 28 what's your favorite drunk sequence in a game thanks I don't even know I remember the first time it was like you know a novelty to get drunk in GTA IV and climb behind the car because it looked so real and then how it was it really was a struggle to drive like oh man this is so weird yeah it's not so much drunk as much as it's drugged but Yoshi and touch fuzzy get dizzy the the level in Yoshi's Island that blew my mind Yoshi got drugged yeah there's like these like these uh little fuzzy things would",

I thought Drake getting drugged in Uncharted three was awesome and really well done yeah that's probably the only sequence I can even think of like honestly I'm sure there's others but yeah it's like it was like that ending question where I'm like I I can think of a bunch of endings I guess but this one was like I I I can't even think of more than one drunk sequence. There must have been more than that I remember Monster Hunter you can get drunk on the Grog and the in or whatever and come",
