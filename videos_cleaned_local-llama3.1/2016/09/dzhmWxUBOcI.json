And I look into it and I download it, I start playing, I'm like, man, this is actually good, you know what I mean? Like I'm having fun playing this, I'm getting my gems, I got all these things there you go, that's some of my XP as you can see I'm getting closer to level four right there, I got all these challenges to do but I'm playing it and I'm like well this is this is just Zelda and it said like they say the thing like inspired by Zelda and it's like n **** you ain't inspired by Zelda you're ripping off Zelda.
