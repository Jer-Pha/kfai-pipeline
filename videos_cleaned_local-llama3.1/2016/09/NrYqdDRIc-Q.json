So I was looking so basically everything about football the last 10 years or so has to do with this thing called CTE which is a degenerative brain disease. And I'm always going to say wrong but it's chronic traumatic encephalopathy, I think that's how you call it. It's a degenerative disease that happens when brains are concussed over and over again. It causes a lot of damage with like recurring hits. Tells the truth, tell exactly there was a movie with Will Smith, Concussion about the doctor in Pennsylvania that discovered that brains of former NFL players uh were really **** up. Mhm um and so uh it causes Alzheimer's also dementia depression all those kinds of things but it really focuses around CTE and this degenerative disease that a lot of football players have.

They what do they do? Is there a doctor sitting anywhere and the guy is like, \"You're going to go through this protocol, I'm independent of all this, and we're going to figure out if you have a concussion or not.\" In 2012, 261 concussions happened in the NFL; 271 in 2015.

The question then becomes: if there are few, not many, players playing at the youth level, then there's fewer players playing at high school; then the pool to go to college becomes smaller; then the pool to draw from for the NFL becomes smaller, and so on and so forth. And the idea is that... and what people think is that football might go extinct because parents are not willing to expose their youth, their kids, to a demonstrably dangerous sport that has all the statistics behind it stating that at some point 40 or 50% of players are going to have some sort of degenerative brain disease, even if you only played in the NCAA and then went on to.",

Okay God, and I just can't express to you the feeling of locking eyes with this animal for the first time, seeing pure evil. I just don't know if you've ever had this feeling before. This thing was long, very lean, pure white, like something that scared the Dickens out of it or it was just a ghost running around one-eyed, wore a patch, had a peg leg, no but the thing with this cat was it was he was and the guy warned me he said look the cat's a good cat but occasionally it likes to just jump on your head and I was like I know are you serious about this and he said yes occasionally it'll just come up and you just push it off it's fine it'll go away so I'm watching.",
