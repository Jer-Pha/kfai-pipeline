They need to differentiate from toilet paper, you know, cuz why not just buy toilet paper instead and just put that on there? Nobody I get that, I get that. No people use toilet paper, I do. I do. I'm just saying nobody's putting that out as like tissues for guests, but I think that's what I'm saying, that's why it's so ornate, that's why they sell it in this way. It's because cuz you could just put it in a toilet paper-esque design. By the way, that's the Pure One. Tim Gettys, do you think there's money to be made in the design of tissue boxes? Tissue boxes no, okay. I think they probably have an artist on staff who's just overworked; he just cranks them out. I don't think he's an artist, you know.

And then his pockets would be filled with cans of beer, usually Budweiser, and stuff.

These guys somehow do volume in food to such a degree that it's like a grocery store - their margin is like 4%. If you're Cheesecake Factory and you're selling that much food, 4% of your margin is actually a lot of money. So I would just really be interested to see the backend of how a restaurant like that runs as opposed to a restaurant like Nopa that has 10 appetizers and seven entrees, then a full bar - you know, which is really the appropriate way that you're supposed to... You got the thing I always get reminded of when I go to a Cheesecake Factory though: there's 500 things on this menu. You no way any of this stuff is fresh; not at all, it's all shipped and frozen - everything's getting fried. That's pretty much it. Sure you have to assume half that stuff.

No, it's not fresh all Apple be same thing. It's all it probably all all the food gets shipped to them in like the same style package. It's just a frozen package they rip it open and throw it in a fryer. There's a major difference between fresh food and and that kind of food. Although I didn't know that when I was younger, and but Cheesecake Factory is appropriately priced and I so I think you kind of get what you pay for there uh it just it was it was weird to be back there because I hadn't gone in many years but no are they are they a Pepsi restaurant or a Coca-Cola restaurant.

Yes there the two most quotable people in American history are Ben Franklin and Mark Kanye West - oh Kanye West and they they both existed in in a time when uh a lot of people couldn't even read, and then uh even less so Mark Twain's time than Ben Franklin's time.

That game is a massive commercial success still years after it came out because it's **** awesome. And we were talking about that as as the the the antithesis of Absu, which I think is just this try-hard Journey.

So I guess that's what I'm saying is that like I appreciate and love art but I also think the market speaks to Art, just the way the market speaks to a glass, just the way the market speaks to a phone. Mhm, hard because that's my question though. You know, money is a decent indicator, but often times what what in film specifically, money is an indicator of how much marketing money pushed you know this in front of people to the point where they're going to watch it right like a perfect example of that is Batman v Superman which very uh a lot of people no one can find any good in Transformers.

Um, so the question that becomes like, if people pushed something like The Neon Demon hard enough - if you put $20 million or $30 million worth of marketing behind that - would that film have made money? I guarantee it. Because, I mean, with the trailer without knowing it was the guy who did Drive, I saw that and was like, \"This looks awesome.\" And with movie trailers these days, I mean, when you're talking about the Transformers or the Marvel movies or whatever comedies and stuff, it's like, we find those. You know, we especially us talk about those things constantly. The moment a Star Wars trailer comes out, it is a matter of moments before we've seen it three times. You know? So for me to see a movie trailer about a movie I have never heard of is pretty rare. Right? So it's when we go to see those movies that we were just talking about.",

That's an important note too because I think you can market the **** out of anything to make it relevant right? But my other side of the argument to me is what movie from 20 or 30 years ago is just this unknown quantity still like, like it's just sitting there on a shelf and someone's waiting to discover it. You know what I mean? Like it's like we already know, like as far back then, it's like The Breakfast Club is like a classic everyone loves that movie because it's **** awesome. But Heathers was probably not a very good movie, and while like we have some nostalgic glasses about it and we think it's a good movie. It's Not The Breakfast Club right?

People like a lot of people love that film exactly. And so, like I feel like I feel like it's it's it's a complicated issue, but I I also think it's just it could be boiled down to like yeah you could have all these external things - the marketing and the attention you give it, obviously Journey is a good example of Sony going to put a lot of money for that game and they're going to put their their attention behind that and maybe you force that into the into the Limelight.

Not that didn't make Journey great, and so like there are a million things I love where I'm like, I don't understand how this isn't bigger, but I know that something's missing, there's a piece of the puzzle missing, it's not mass consumer enough, it's not... and it doesn't diminish its right to exist and doesn't diminish its value.
