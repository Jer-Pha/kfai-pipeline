Remember on September 7th you can go to Switch That TV such as Kinda Funny Games and watch our pre- and post-shows all about the PlayStation meeting, and of course watch it while we do the meeting itself; we'll talk over it. Oh wait, so this was a lesser Patreon before a Patreon patron the week before for normal users, Monday before - this will be the Monday, yeah, it's coming up soon. What I like about Ming's question here is the fact that it's deeper than what we usually get. Once in a while, Khan, I'll talk about PlayStation me, I think in the last piece, I love you; we did actually want to know what we'd want out of a Vita - but we never go into UI software; we always get hung up",

They're not gonna sell 50 million units or even 40 million units of a handheld ever again. Nintendo is struggling to hit like really high numbers, and reach those numbers they have. But you know PSP was around 80 million, DS was over 150 million or something like that. It's like these are insane numbers that are never gonna be reached again in the handheld market.

So it's like even if it is chunkier, it does have the shoulder buttons and the analogs and everything's proper right. But I think a unique way to do that would be instead of having the next Vita being a system, have it being a platform, even if it is what PlayStation Now could turn into or whatever the hell they want to call PlayStation Plus, PlayStation Now plays, they add other things, but like PlayStation something that what if it was an app on a phone that you can get on iOS or on Google Play and use it.",

That's what they've done with VR; they weren't there really at the tip of the spear of VR was a bold move and I think it's gonna pay off for them ultimately. It might take time and it might come outside of gaming. Comes from some other part of Sony but being on VR and making sure that they have a proprietary piece of hardware there, I think it's very smart.

Well yeah that's not and that's not really good for the gamer.

In Brazil, for instance, games are significantly marked up. Hardware is like outrageously expensive there because of significant taxes on imports. There's things like that that happen.

It's not the furthest Mega Man has ever gone out of side of the classic series where it's Mega Man, it's X and the unfortunate thing is Classic and Zero are dead; we have never even got a bridge game that put them together which would have been awesome and would have been obviously they do maybe for its 25th anniversary for Mega Man Command Generations your time on Sonic Generations no sorry I was I was I was I was real quick, I'm like is that it Wily Castle um so I feel like the future of Megaman is uncertain so so first of all my number 9 no one likes my",

You could have spread those games out and been more thoughtful or maybe spam them for a little while and then went away and then spam them again there's people's appetite for them come back so I would love 11 and in the same vein as 9/10 and I'd love X9 because I think that those those games are really good too and they're different but I really do believe yeah I do believe we're gonna get a triple A Mega Man game open-world game like I just feel that that's what they're gonna do.

You know, we understand, and I think Megaman's creators know what they went through with that game. I would kill to write that game - I have this vision for that game that would be awesome. I want it to be dark and violent; one of the big things is like the robots are killing humans, like Megaman is murdering these robots, and...

My question is, how should reviews work for games with multiple versions? For instance, series like Pok\u00e9mon Fire Emblem Fates, or our games, which release on multiple platforms at the same time. Should reviewers do two separate reviews? The Too Much Water critique, for example, seems to apply more to Pok\u00e9mon Sapphire than Pok\u00e9mon Ruby. Thanks. Congrats to the new studio and keep up the great work. Know they should play a version of it and be very clear on which version they played. I mean, when we were at IGN, and we did multi-platform reviews, it was always the thing of... I play through it usually on the PlayStation SKU for trophies or whatever the reasoning was, or that's what\"",
