So people voted for Bush because they said he was the candidate they most wanted to have a beer with. I guess Trump's the one you want to do cocaine with. So I I I mean to me this is a very political year. It's a very politically charged year. There's a lot of tragedy happening. I I think Donald Trump's a I can't imagine Donald Trump winning. So to me he's just a fascinating person to watch. But I keep saying that and we're only 54 days away from Iowa now. So, um, you know, time the window's closing.

No, but there are parts shot in IMAX. Some parts? Yeah, but the rest of the movie is not. It's not like it's Interstellar. Well, I guess it is like Interstellar. It's exactly I'll concede that.
