And I was really, really happy with it because I was like, \"All right, this is essentially Amplitude but Rock Band, I'll take it, like that's the closest we're ever going to get.\" Then we got a game called Rock Band Blitz that was a downloadable title for the PS3 and Xbox 360, and it was Rock Band Unplugged but on consoles, but even more good as and really, really dumb down.

Yeah, give me 48s of a kick drum right now, 48 of a kick. What's that mean? 48 of a kick, never heard that particular term up in the street like I did. No, I C, I certainly didn't. Um, anyways, so I was playing this game, and a big thing about the original Amplitude was the frequency had a lot of this like music nobody no one's ever heard of some um like drum and bass stuff that I guess is popular to people who know that music but but to people who didn't know electronic music it's like new right?

The best albums of all time, um, and it's I started playing it and instantly it's like alright this is Amplitude; it's the beat matching to that exact exact exact moment and you start playing it and you start remembering the rhythm and **** and it does that thing music games do where you just get in the zone but Amplitude does it differently where yeah guitar here you start going it's just like whoa I can't believe I got through that because Amplitude is set so it's track by track, you make the music for this instrument happen then move on move on but there's a split second to move tracks over so it's like you need to be like kind of multi",

Like these are catchy and memorable for what they are.\" The biggest flaw of the game is the fact that all the songs sound the same. Yeah, it's just... there's not that the beauty of Amplitude was one song is Slipknot and one is garbage and one is a rap song and one is whatever. Like, uh, Run DMC was in it. Like, it's just... it was so eclectic. This is not eclectic at all. This is so the same thing - just drum and bass electronic music, which is great, but I think that's a turnoff to a lot of people. You stole the words from me; I was going to say, \"Which is a turnoff for me.\" I... I mean, I know this isn't... this is your game. We're not like debating, but I mean for me it was like...

But you know after few fuckups towards the end when I'm trying to get this trophy, which is like beat the entire career on expert in one sitting without dying or retrying or stopping, and so in one sitting, and I'm like well I can't really beat the last songs in one sitting, so over and over and over and over again. So we'll see my dream of YouTube stardom and just focus on that, I will be the Amplitude Master there you go. But anyway, Amplitude - if you haven't checked it out, please do because I do think that uh you're our only hope of getting DLC.

Freedom Planet came out on Wii U in late October I think on the eShop. I just downloaded it started playing it based on one tweet from from one of the best friends out there and he was like Tim if you love Shovel Knight you need to play Freedom Planet interesting it is to Sega what Shovel Knight is to Nintendo.

I **** knew it from the fact that's why I took the exclusive in the first place, and I wanted to talk to those guys because I knew that that game was going to be massive for people like me.
