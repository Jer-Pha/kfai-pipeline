The world is a vast place. Do you guys have Benihana out here? No, no. But I know Benihana in Columbia, Missouri; they used to do like unlimited Wings Wednesday or some sort of deal like that. Hooters has that here. Yeah, Hooters wings suck. They're bad. See, I don't mess with pickle chips though. Do they? Oh, no. We had some Comic-Con stuff - great.

But the Marina is like that in general; the Marina is always crowded, which is why I don't go out for dinner in my neighborhood ever. Like, the place I went to last night was in the Mission, and it's very stressful. It's not... I don't understand what you guys are talking about with the stress of going to a nice restaurant. Here's P go to OpenTable make a reservation and go there at the time so I get to the restaurant last night right and they're like, \"What time is your reservation?\" I was like, \"It's 8:15.\" It was 8:10 at this point; they're like, \"Great.

Uh, but uh yeah so like the thing about it is that like Greg probably can actually relate to this more and and maybe you can more than Tim and I can in the sense that when you live in the suburbs like when you live in Inland Empire or something like that, like you don't have a metropolitan life. So like, and I don't mean that as a good thing or a bad thing, you just don't have the New York City experience. It's not to say like Sabre, like the famous Office uh joke about how Michael goes to Manhattan and gets his favorite pizza far whatever. These chains exist but New York City is like a hot of great food and like you know where to go and you can go to any bagel shop or any pizza place.",

And so my like my exposure to that didn't happen until I really moved to San Francisco, and it really didn't happen until I wasn't making $40 or $50,000 a year anymore either. So you know like when we were barely scraping by, and I was actually when we went out the other day for Sin's uh um engagement party, like eight or nine of us went out with old friends of ours, we said hang out with, and you came up a lot. We were talking showing old pictures and talking about old times Beta Breakers and all this kind of stuff, and um we were talking about how like we didn't have a lot of us didn't have two nickels to rub together but we didn't know any better, and like I I remember running",
