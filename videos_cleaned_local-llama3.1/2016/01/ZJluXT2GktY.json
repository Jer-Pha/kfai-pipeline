Um, just not what I'm looking for in a Metal Gear game, and I don't think it's the epitome of gameplay that like, that people talk about it as. It is. I think as I said on the previous one, I think there's there's many examples of third-person shooters. I feel better so it's it's to which all the comments go. It's a stealth game, okay? Just it could be whatever you want; just saving them the trouble of putting it below this video. It could be whatever you want to be. I did love as I said, I loved that loop of uh clearing things out being very silent until you know until you're found after 45 minutes. You wanted to throw your controller out the window. Um, but so I appreciate it. It's there. I wanted to give it a go, but it's not a game I have any interest in going back. What is your favorite",

I'm a huge fan of Wolfenstein: The New Order. I think the game's really cool as hell, um, so I went and I earlier this year, may or whatever it was, The Old Blood came out, the DLC, and I got like halfway through it, and then I just stopped playing it, um, so I just deleted my save and started playing it again, and I got about halfway through it, and and still haven't beaten it yet, uh, but I just I really love MachineGames. I love those guys; they just think they understand the story-driven first-person shooter. I think the game feels great.

Um but I played all the way through that game, they figured out the gameplay, it's really interesting, like smart card based tile based tactics uh game and like just a good wacky like Metal Gear Side Story um so track it down I think you I think you would actually really like Metal Gear Acid too sounds like it sounds like it would hit like the thing you're talking about yeah scratch that itch because it is it is a very specific itch because it's not just Str like turn based strategy role playing games I like like I played Disgaea and I appreciate it people love those games like",

This guy is different, though, because that's kind of a never-ending thing. Yeah, and it's also like stacking enemies on the same tile; you're doing billions of points of damage. I'm like, \"What the ****?\" Parody in a lot of ways, tactics especially like War of the Lines on PSP, which I think is the epitome of that. You know, the nice translation and all that is just... I don't understand how they how Square doesn't understand that they can make that game again and sell it even for $60 if they really wanted to; they don't have to upgrade Valkyria Chronicles is probably like the closest thing that that that anyone has gotten, but these these...

It really focuses on like environment destructibility, so there's a whole lot of like you can repel up a wall and then bust in through a window and then send out your little camera bot to see where the terrorists are, and they're all held up in the next room. But you don't have to go in through the door - you can put a charge on the wall and blow out the wall and get behind them and take them all out before they know what's going on.

The player attempts to defeat the evil Lord Brevan. Blah blah blah all this stuff. Evil Lord now. While the game focuses on fast-paced platforming, its levels are interinterspersed with slower action scenes. Those slower action scenes are boss fights that are awesome.
