But as long as you're on the same page, go for it. If you're not communicating though, and one person wants it more and the other person wants it less, and that's not communicated, then that's really bad. That is a big issue. I mean, obviously we talk about communication a lot on this show, and it's really important. Like sex is one of those things that you... were saying it's scary to talk about, and kind of weird. But then once it's not weird, then all of a sudden you guys are great because you're golden - you're like, oh wait, we can talk about this. And if we're not on the same page, get on the same page, and then everything's golden and great. The beauty of it is that you really don't need...",
