It's also a consistent gameplay experience problem. I know how frustrating online gaming can be, and I understand the allure of dodging the headache altogether. Recently, I too have thought to myself, \"You know what? I'm about done with online gaming.\" Even though I'm not entirely sure that's a reasonable thing to say given where the industry is and where it's going. All my favorite games are from the 90s, and more and more I feel like the magic of online gaming, which was there a decade or so ago, has all but lost its luster. I'm still thoroughly enjoying online co-op stuff, but the PvP stuff, even though I'm good at it, is always full of inconsistent experiences that are migraine inducing, so it's become a huge turnoff for me.

Whereas with single-player, you know how you never know how long it's gonna go? Yeah, for me, it's a lot of a mix of all that stuff. I think the time sink is the biggest thing - just the fact that I like games to be tied experiences where it's like, \"I know this is 13 hours\" and \"oh, this is eight hours,\" and \"oh yeah, it's 25 hours... whatever it is.\" Or you know, a Final Fantasy, more like 40 hours or whatever. Like I like knowing that, and with these, it's that time never ends. Yeah. I do agree that a lot of people think that's awesome, and I will say that I think that the pinnacle of enjoyment in a video game is if you have that squad of people and you're all playing that game together - whatever your game is, it doesn't even need to be one; whether you play Halo or Call of Duty.",

There's certain things I am good at, and I think those are things I've spent the most time online gaming with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater music games like Amplitude and stuff like that back in the day. DDR on the Xbox had an online mode that was all just like leaderboard stuff or there just be other skaters around, and at the end of the day it was just a leaderboard just happening with someone else in that thing or doing like graffiti in Tony Hawk and stuff like that. Like, but that it's simple; I think that's what it comes down to is you can get good at that, sure, but you don't need other people involved, and you're never gonna be that good at it, and if you are, that's weird.

And when there are goals, this brings me back to like Halo 2, like with the level up system, level 50, that was a goal, yeah. All my friends were trying to get it, I knew I could never get that but seeing them trying to get it made me want to play with them because I was good at capture the flag. I can't shoot for **** but I can capture that goddamn flag so it's like I would play with them and do that and all of a sudden then it was fun because there was something that I was competent at, and we were playing with a bunch of people that had the same level and it was fun.
