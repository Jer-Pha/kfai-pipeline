Star Fox - Okay, Star Fox he'll sell like 100,000 copies probably so we have we have we have Star Fox that looks like it was made 15 years ago, great. Uh, but no, for seriously and I think we all know it's the unknown that is what's most important to Nintendo this year. And this really is the most consequential year for them since at least 2006 and probably earlier than that. Um, this is a huge year for Nintendo, and if they - we I we will know by this time next year, really in all reality, if like their trajectory is hardware for the long run or their TR is ultimately going to go third party because we'll know just like it was clear as the day is long when the Wii U came out; it was going",

But for me, I think that the NX - like we keep carrying it, they're going to be some hybrid system, and that's what everybody thinks. And I think that's a safe assumption; I think that \"X\" stands for \"CrossOver.\" It's a safe assumption, I think, that that'll be it. And I think that means there's no DS then, there's no 3DS. It's this right, and if it's one system that's supposed to do both of those, you take all the 3DS games - like the 3DS has its fast library, and the Wii U has its library that it has, whatever.

Yeah, you know I mean I remember going into the Wii U and thinking that's what it was going to be. I remember it was we're going into that E3 and we all knew that they were going to announce it there and like the Revolution and all this stuff and I'm like holy **** are they going to call this just the Nintendo Entertainment System and are they going to **** kick ass and then they came out with the Wii U and instantly everyone knew the confusion of just what is this, is this an add-on, is this what the hell when's it coming, what like why why why here's **** a Batman game you've already played like all this stuff was like God damn it and like I will be shocked if Nintendo doesn't do that again.

So all signs mhm point you know Zelda seems to have been delayed specifically for NX so all signs point to X giving it to you yeah I'm I'm excited I mean I'm excited but I'm I'm nervous for them too because they don't have another **** up moment like they can't they cannot **** it up. Yeah, I mean in terms of third party though I do think that we'll see Final Fantasy VII remake on the NX and I think that's a very key important move for them to make and if it's not there that's a bad sign the cloud thing could be telegraphing that so I really hope I really hope cuz if they come out and if they announce that at E3 that's huge you know it is huge I mean it's still coming to PS4 first yeah but I exactly but that to me I'm talking about just in terms of the third party support like",
