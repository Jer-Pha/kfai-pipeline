I don't give a **** about it, but I saw the second one, whatever. The turtles look like morons; they look awful. It just looks awful; it just looks terrible. Now Rocksteady and Bebop being in it is cool, and they look fine. It's just that someone took a CG jizz over the screen, and that's totally fine. But I did like Megan Fox, but also Casey Jones, who's like by far my favorite character in Turtles, like by a mile.

No, because now people have to refer to him as Bucky; he has to walk down the street, and people go \"Bucky, Bucky.\" There's money falling out of your pockets; he's like, \"Thanks, I don't give a ****.
