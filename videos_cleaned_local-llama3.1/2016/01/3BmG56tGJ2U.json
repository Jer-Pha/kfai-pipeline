I mean we haven't seen anything from it since E3 right? I think they just have to ship or get off the pot. I think they know that no nothing. Um, I mean I don't know. Not that that's necessarily a bad sign. That game, that game's not going to get delayed if that game gets delayed they are joking over there with that stuff because they they can't do that they wouldn't even announce the date if they knew no no no no. Um, I don't really know. I mean I don't think Horizon's going to get delayed. A lot of the releases that we're really cognizant of right now were are or that are soon are games that have been locked into the state or have been pushed already so they're",

I'm letting you keep looking; I'll move on. No, yeah, just move on because I mean there's plenty of games in here like Hot Shots Golf is on here and I was like, \"Yeah, I hope it comes out,\" but that seems like the kind of game that they just like all of a sudden like in April be like, \"Oh, it's out in two weeks.\" Like, oh great. You know what? Recore is on this list for 2016; I don't think Recore is gonna make it. Zelda, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised; they have to put it out this year if that doesn't mean they will.

Playing through Final Fantasy VII PC port on the PS4 has got me thinking what scenes Slums towns etc are you looking forward to seeing the most and how they're handled in the upcoming remake? I for one really interested to see the Temple of the Ancients and the City of the Ancients eventually be portrayed. Kyle from Regina, I mean it's it's it's contrived but Midgar is the one they really have to nail and I think you know I mean maybe Cosmo Canyon or something like that or the Gold Saucer but like I but Midgar is the ominous capital city you know and I think that they really have to have to nail that.

I'm really interested in Cosmo Canyon because that was one of the moments in the game that impressed me with its look and scope, including the big telescope and all that stuff, and the music - it felt different from the rest of the game. I'm excited to see what they do with the PS4 and all that. Um, and also just the town of Nibelheim - is that how you say it? I don't know. Uh, not necessarily is that where you meet Sephiroth right? Schuman no, isn't that the town that gets burned? Yeah, okay, yeah, got to get burned. The one that's also in Final Fantasy VII, yeah a little bit, yeah.

But I want to see like the town because that town had a real distinct look to it in terms of everything was really kind of old looking, and like there were a lot of buildings you can go into and kind of piece together story elements and like read you know notes left on people's tables and like looking through drawers. And that would be interesting to me of what that looks like in modern landscape. Yeah, there are there are characters I want to see too, like Yui or Yu (meaning Yuy), or Yuy. I always called her Yuy. I think it is pronounced Yuy though. Uh, when we didn't know how anything was pronounced, that's so funny. I never even heard anyone say that but that makes sense.

It's like anytime a game breaks me from the experience because I want to enjoy a technical aspect for it; I think that's really cool. MH two things: one, one weird and not thought of too often, one that's somewhat obvious; one is interface and menu design. Like I feel like there are some games that just understand that volume is great. So there will be times when you want to go to VA, like V, like reset a level or go back to a checkpoint, and it's just it should just be like muscle memory, like start down, down X, start up X, you know. Little things like that don't make me go into these deep menus but even if you just need to.",

Um, real quick sidebar, I'm sorry, was volume good or bad in the interface part? Oh, good. Okay, cool. Just making sure. Um, uh, so that's one that's one of the things I think about, just random things that we might overlook, similar to maybe ambient sound and score. Uh, that's really good; less obvious thing is load times. There are games that load so quickly, and I have no idea how they did it, and then there are games with load times where I'm like, what are you even loading? MH, and uh, you know, I, I have very little patience for a long load times. Bloodborne was one of those games where I'm like this is insane, and I know that they, I know that they were passionate about it now, but when it came out, it was insane; you could go like literally make a sandwich, like I know people say that, but you could like literally just leave, walk in, take",

            "text": "\"Hate it when games are just like, 'Here's all the endings.' I want to know what the canonical ending is and what all the different fun versions are. What if there's no canon? There always is a canon. Always. You have any more, Colin? No, I think that if it ever resonates with the people making the game and they think it's important, then that's good. I don't like it for replay value sake; I think it's stupid. But if there's a reason \u2013 if they're trying to say something or tell a story in a way that's meaningful and give people some closure in ways that make them feel like their choices mattered \u2013 then I think that's pretty cool. Or just to throw people off and just make them think a little bit about what they're doing in the game, and Spec Ops, which we talked about in the last topic, I think was a great example of that. Fallout: New Vegas was another great example of making choices in games where you didn't even know what the heck you were really doing.\"",
