You all left me hanging on Interstellar for like a year. No, there are you guys like, \"You should see Interstellar.\" No one's like, \"You should see Interstellar.\" Colin, I'm there. I think I've said it like three or four times on the podcast. So we can ask people that are watching right now to go through and see if they know how many times that I was like, \"Colin, you'd love it.\" That's all you said, though - \"You love\" in that is the movie for you. This is a movie for you. I like dance. Like, anyways, though, you might you might like Interstellar. Call it... I think I even said the same thing about X-Men, and you did this then you did this wink thing to me. The camera couldn't see that. Why did you do it? Cheat out, cheat out, play to the crowd.

Why don't you go by the ones that were actually shot because we're given like our one-sentence reviews of some three of us didn't see any of these movies for each one. 90% of them go next. I saw two movies this year: there was Hot Tub Time Machine 2, which I didn't love; it wasn't as good as the first one, arguably. The first one is amazing, is **** amazing. Wait, was it the story with the first hot tub time machine that Colin was dying to show me that movie and then we finally watched it and he like fell asleep like 10 minutes into the movie and we watched it; loved it; he was so upset I my he was soet soet you we didn't wake him up or stop it, my buddy um two of my.",

It wasn't the way Christopher Nolan intended it. You couldn't enjoy Miller's planet on that. I saw it just fine, thank you very much. I saw Trainwreck; it was good.

And there was one thing when we looked at the calendar going forward, and that was the one where like, that was the one where we were like, it's this is going to be bad, and hopefully, the two doesn't even happen. So it's like, yeah, we called it Straight Outta Compton. I want to see that. Oh man, I forgot about that. That might be a movie that was up there. It's not, it's still not my favorite. I still don't think it beats Mad Max: Fury Road, but see if it's on demand yet, dude. That movie was awesome, you guys would love it, I'm sure. You would love it just because of the music and because of the time that it is so nostalgic and the way they shot it. I think it was Emmanuel Lubezki who shot it, what like perfectly nailed not Los Angeles, not the period, but the way we remember that time period, like the Rodney King beating, like uh them getting arrested in Detroit for singing \"What's Going On\" to the police.",

I actually wanted to see this because we saw Hunger Games Mocky J Part One. We slept through part one. I saw the whole thing; I was awake that whole movie. Were you unable to sleep? Couldn't sleep. That series actually got better as it kept going, cuz it got more money in and the story actually got fairly interesting.
