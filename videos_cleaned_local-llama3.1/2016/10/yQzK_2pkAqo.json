Am I eating this badly? Nor is it this prevalent in the way of what I'm talking about here. Is that I had five poutines in four days. Poutine, of course, I can't remember when it came on to my radar in terms of a food thing - French fries, cheese curds, gravy.

And I say this not to insult anywhere else; we've been there, from New York, fantastic. What I love about New York is their pizza \u2013 it's on every corner, there are a million different pizzas, they got bagels, everything's great. Don't get me wrong, and I know you have amazing Chinese food in Chicago, the casserole pizza, the Chicago-style pizza, the stuffed pizza \u2013 amazing.

I can't be objective about this. Everybody you jump in at Austin, we're gonna torch tacos left and right, yeah. But I feel like there's great Torchy's tacos; I'm cueing in on those and I'm eating those over and over. And then somebody's like, well what about this other great taco shop?
