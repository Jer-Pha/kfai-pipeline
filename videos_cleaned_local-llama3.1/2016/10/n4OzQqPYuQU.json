I liked when we first got it, it was like \"Pop It On\" \"Pop It Off\", do whatever all that stuff. But when we were doing let's plays and even when I was playing Batman on day two or whatever at the house, putting it on centering it here bringing this in making sure the top portion was right against your forehead... it it once you figure out what everything does and why it's laid out the way it does and you lock it in and then you crank it in, it really does block out the light I feel really well. Give you a good visual perspective on what's going to happen and then take you to that world.

We didn't talk about when we unboxed it because we hadn't had our firsthand experience with it. But uh, I thought this was a pretty ingenious way they did this, especially because you can't see what you're doing when you have the headset on obviously in terms of real life Skycam for me, thank you very much. So this is the little uh headset Command Center here. Oh I guess you took all your codes already so it doesn't matter. Oh yeah, these are all my old codes that I we redeemed already.

Yeah, because basically it's it's it's replacing the right analog stick. Your head is so, and you use left stick to move.

I was thinking of a PSN name that I'd have forever, my go-to was Campos 63 as that had been my 360 gamertag for years. Upon realizing this was taken, I decided to think outside the box and ask my brother for recommendations. We agreed to allow him to make the name for me, thinking I'd be able to change it like on the Xbox. He grabbed the controller from me, and from that moment on, I was known as Ask Boner 69. To this day, we have no idea what the meaning is behind the name is, and we laugh at the fact that I have no ability to change it. At times, I can even seem embarrassed when people ask me for my PSN name. So, for this, I ask you: let us change our names as always. I love the show, and everything you guys do - da da da.
