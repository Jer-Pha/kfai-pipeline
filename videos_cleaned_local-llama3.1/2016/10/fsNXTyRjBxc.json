This is not you say it's oh it's Power Rangers; this is not Power Rangers in a lot of ways. Power Rangers is super corny; Power Rangers is super uh over-the-top um and lighthearted. This is not that. I still, I mean obviously they're going for much more of a Chronicle vibe with this, which I think a lot. I saw a lot of uh not criticism but a lot of people saying that yeah this reminds them of Chronicle and especially this scene we not right here where they have to kind of discover their powers and test their powers, right um. But I feel like this captures the spirit of Power Rangers um while still bringing it into the 21st century. It's still about a group of kids; it's still about them discovering Powers; it's an origin story. This is an origin story which is great um. It's going to be fun to watch them come together and fight Rita Repulsa um there's it's going to be",

You can't you can't do that now, especially since you're you're you know a movie that's this expensive and and and that they're going to market this heavily has to target new audiences, you have to bring in new audiences with this, and you can't I don't think that you could put out that that level of cheese and get modern day you know tweens right now which I think is the audience probably going for with this exactly. And I think that uh you know so far at least like this trailer has millions and millions and millions of views, of course uh and it but but it's like kind of shocking uh and it is getting the type of views that like Marvel movies get or like big big time things and Power Rangers scene is kind of",

And Power Rangers scene is kind of a niche, uh, yeah, I mean, I would imagine it's not quite as popular as like some, like the X-Men or Avengers. Um, but I mean, you have to admit it's a great move for them, like saying Power Rangers to anyone that any one of your friends they know it, yeah, they might not be huge fans of it, but everyone knows the Power Rangers. So, the biggest kind of issue with this trailer as a Power Ranger fan that everyone's talking about is that they have powers as civilians now in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, they did not, um, they were able to kind of fight the Putties every once in a while, but then they would have to morph and uh to continue fighting. I'm not against it really; I think that I think that it adds it gives levels to them - they can fight as civilians, then there's the morph level",

Is that a red Ford Ranger? It is a red Ford Ranger. It looks like you go there, you go. So we got Jason here, you can go forward Kevin, um it's so weird to see things like there's there's signs that say Angel Grove and I'm like man like like right there they really did take the original Mighty Morphin and kind of like flush it out little by little. We're seeing Jason with his dad, so these characters are actually like there's some layers to them which is interesting.

Uh, in the original Power Rangers um series Rita created the Green Power Coin which then made Tommy the Green Ranger so Rita being like the source of the green rangers Power makes sense and I think that this is kind of a modernization of that so that could be pretty cool. She violently throws Trini here boom backwards lightning bolt. I don't like that at all.
