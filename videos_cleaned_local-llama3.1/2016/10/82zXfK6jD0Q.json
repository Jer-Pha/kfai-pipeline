Everybody Nintendo and all the press release always all caps Nintendo 64 if you wrote N64 they're like no it's all caps Nintendo 64 you know how they are and uh so yeah we we got that domain very early on on and then created this website and it had a lot of like Nintendo looking Graphics like the ratings um scale was like Mario hats it was like red Mario hats so you could totally mistake it for the official site which is what happened and then after a while Nintendo said uh that's kind of our brand CU we registered it now and uh you know what can we do but to be fair they were pretty gracious um Doug Perry the EIC at the time went met with Nintendo and so they put a plan in place where N64 ig.com terrible domain",

No like but but think about like how IGN changed over the years right? We only hired writers; they all wrote articles. Our website would update automatically at midnight once a day. If you had a typo, it'll be there for the next 24 hours right that's how IGN was in the beginning and then writers started doing more stuff like when we launched the IGN boards in the year 2000 um suddenly you're like oh crap the mic's on they're all these people you realized how many people were like reading the stuff and then editors became social media managers they're like oh every day I got to talk to my audience and then when we launched videos some people were really good on\"",

I heard the podcasts all the time; you'd be like, \"Peer doesn't listen to this podcast,\" but I totally listened. I remember when Casey was the EIC - this is just a memory I have - when he was there late doing something, and Greg and I walked in at like 10 at night on a Wednesday, and he's like, \"What the hell are you guys doing here?\" And I'm like, \"They're doing their TGS press conference. What do you think we're doing here? We're here to write the news.\" And he was kind of being mystified almost by it in a way, where it's like, \"Wow, you guys really care about this.\"",

You know, and I love that analogy because I think it really does make sense: you're passing that ball of clay off to the next person or whatever, and we all learn so much because, in a single kind of IGN headquarters are in San Francisco, and a lot of the basically the entire games team is in one big area right; and we have another studio in LA for entertainment, New York, Chicago, but most of editorial is there, and like you guys hear all the stuff other people are doing, and that's I mean honestly, I mean Greg was so impactful when he just walked in and he's like, \"I'm a gamer,\" I'm a writer, but I can also do this kind of thing.",

Well I know that's when I always tell people my story right and like how I always talk about it I got there right as the old guard was turning over and burning out certain people or you know trying to figure out what they wanted to do but I was talking about thanks a lot no you know what I mean but like Craig Harris was always very vocal, like I don't want to be on video, I don't want to read, I'm not doing it\"",

I so I think that you, it came more naturally to you, and you had the benefit that we had back in the text days when Matt and I did our uh Q&As. Right? We had input and inquiry on IGN 64, where we answered reader letters, and we got this amazing feedback from our audience just via emails. So you got this encouragement to do it, and like, I think you got it instantly.
