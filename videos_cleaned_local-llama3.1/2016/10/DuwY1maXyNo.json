Uh, and strong moral character: 45% think Clinton has a strong moral character; 30% think Trump has a strong moral character. Qualified to be president: 59% think Clinton is qualified to be president; 39% think Trump is qualified to be president. Um, 62% of Americans think that uh you cannot trust Hillary Clinton.

I'm not saying that they didn't exist there. What I'm saying is like they were Coastal Elites talking to other Coastal Elites, and it's like a whole thing where it's like these people, those kids were desperate too.
