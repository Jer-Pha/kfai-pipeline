When I wear it, you guys are all going to be scared of me; it's going to be amazing. Okay, that is one way that could go. Scared of me, I'm a Death Eater at heart. Um, so we get to London, uh, and I thought you were a rug muncher, woah! I still am, the uh, so we get to London, and uh, the crazy thing is, I kind of sprung a little bit on these tickets. Um, the ticket arrived ahead of time, so how did you get them? Cuz we were originally trying to work okay, so I was originally trying to reach out to everyone we knew to try to figure out if anyone could get me a ticket, and then Daniel Radcliffe said, \"Don't ever call me.\"",

There's an intermission between. So what happened was originally I bought what I thought was two tickets. Now on the site it said hey, we'll like two tickets equals uh uh you get to go into part one and part two. So one ticket is part one and part two. So if you buy two, you get two tickets to both parts. If that makes sense, it's very confusing. So I was like okay, and I bought the cheapest tickets that were there thinking these are really cheap, these are like half as much as the other tickets but maybe I'm just lucking out here, and sure as **** to get there and it's just one set of tickets, it's not two sets of tickets.",
