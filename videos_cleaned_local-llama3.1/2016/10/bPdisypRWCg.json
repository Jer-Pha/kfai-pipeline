I thought you're right now turn on the TV start flipping through the channels and I hit a little movie - I'm sorry, a little film called The Good Son with Macaulay Culkin. You remember this great movie? Elijah Wood, Macaulay Culkin - he's like, \"I got this good guy rep, I'm gonna go play this movie The Good Son where I'm actually the bad son and I killed my little brother and I'm psycho, I'm clearly a psychopath or whatever.\" Before ever seeing The Good Son, saw maybe a trailer for it. I read the novelization of The Good Son through Scholastic - whatever bought at the book club Colin, the little novelization of The Good Son. And then when the movie had the audacity to come to television on pay-per-view, my parents wouldn't let me rent it, wouldn't let me watch it but I'm like \"Mom, I know these characters.\"",

And now this got me thinking, Colin. I also without ever seeing the movie or reading the comic book, read the novelization of Spawn starring John Leguizamo. Now again, didn't see the movie but knew he was the clown in it right? But I read the novelization of Spawn, didn't care about the character before or after, but this is what I did. This is a dumb kid move, this is a dumb thing to do. Danny DeVito and then it dawned on me why didn't my parents try to stop me? Now I guess you could go with the argument he's reading, let him go, yeah that's good enough.

But again, here's what I think might stand out about the books I'm choosing to read right now. They are contemporary to my time. You know what I did not like? I'm reading these Frog and Toad books. These guys - these guys on the cover are riding old-school bicycles with big wheels and little wheels. Well, come on! I need I want to know what's happening with Frog and Toad in real life. What's happening with them now? I didn't like The Streets when you're reading The Great Brain - a great series of books, right?

I'm going to support them being dumb kids like, like if I see my kids trying to collect Terminator 2 cards like I did, smack that stuff out of their hand. What the heck is wrong with you? No dude, I think it's important; I think that that stuff, like as stupid as it is, specifically the trading card thing, I think that there's a camaraderie there and uh you're not buying those things alone, like at least I didn't and the people I know didn't.
