It's still in its infancy, right? We haven't had the 30 years that we have on the console and PC side to see this evolve, and that's very important to note. This is still in its infancy, but the industry has fallen into this rut of free-to-play being the only thing that works. Free-to-play inherently is a very limited business model - it has had examples of some success, but it is also very limited in terms of its application. There are lots of genres we're all familiar with - all the game genres - how many 15-20 game genres? Free-to-play is good for like three or four of them, the most games.\"",

Uh, pre-priced ports have eroded, so premium content has failed. Right, I, it's been tried for a number of years. Price points have eroded; you're not even getting $X prices on this thing; you're lucky to get three bucks, and when you get three bucks there's no recurring business model. So you had a lot of people come in very early on, and this came from this wasn't invented with the smartphone era, of course, you know this was invented in Asia many years ago with Nexon and Cart Rider and a number of different um, you know companies like Shanda and other companies in in the East that and that's been",

You don't, so what do we see? We see over a million apps in the App Store with little to no curation. So what is the gamer to do? I mean, I talked about this in 2005; this is like it's not the gamer's responsibility; it's just same as is the case with a radio listener. It's not the individual's responsibility to listen to 400,000 tracks to try and find The Offspring or Alanis Morissette or whatever that they like.

All these kinds of things are unsustainable, and we don't want this on console; we don't want this in handheld. People are throwing around things where like well they're like look how big mobile gaming is, a third to a fourth of revenue right now is coming from mobile games. I'm like there are literally two billion pieces of hardware that can download these games, and they're like but the VA and 3DS only do two or three percent.

All these games people enjoy, and I respect that. But I also look at it, and I say this thing seems to actually just be infected the way we play games everywhere else, setting weird expectations for price points and all these kinds of things.\" Because to me when someone's whining around saying they spent $60 on The Witcher 3 in 2015, a game that probably would have cost us $100 or something dollars on an equivalent cartridge-based console, I'm like, \"I don't know that that's the gamer's fault.

I think naturally the laws of economics apply in that um you have 650,000 games and over time if given enough time, enough people start losing money; they exit the space. There's industry consolidation that happens. Big Fish buy small fish. You end up with a few larger companies that production qualities increase.

You need to have the platform providers start to care, and say, \"You know what? This is a shitty user experience for our users.\" We are going to crawl into the app stores, we are going to curate, we are going to feature, we are going to promote, we are going to improve the user interface and the user experience of our stores to better surface content, to pick hits, and to not certify crappy games.

I'm going to play for a buck.\" You know? And you hop over, and then you practice, practice, so we kind of wanted to create that - that's a strategy.

Um, from a legality standpoint, a very important point: these are games of skill, so the law says basically as long as a game is a game of skill, not a game of chance where luck is not the determinant factor in the outcome of the game, it is legal. So and we operate currently in like 40 states and Canada, and we soon some bunch of international territories too.
