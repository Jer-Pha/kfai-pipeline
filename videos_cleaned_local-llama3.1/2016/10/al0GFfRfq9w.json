So I'm going to do is I'm going to go Knuckles, we'll play Studiopolis 1, and then I'll go Sonic for Studiopolis 2 does that work? Oh actually, it's only StOB this one okay cool then I'll go Knuckles and I can replay a level with Sonic sure there you go cuz I want to get my boy Sonic out there. I've always been a pretty pure Sonic guy when it comes to this stuff so Knuckles can uh fly and also climb um some in some of the zones, you know, there's walls that he can just run through and break them uh-huh. So one of the new mechanics in the game is the drop Dash, is that a Sonic exclusive move? Okay cool I'll show you guys that later something I really appreciate I mean the old",

Oh Lord, a front and back. Oh yeah, so if he's like leaning forward or leaning what... you even hit me. The film \"The Film\" is going to get you; the film always gets me. Oh, there you go. That's awesome, yeah. The animation in this is so cute; it's awesome, yeah. But uh, it's not just the main characters. Uh, actually, the enemies... uh have an updated animation even for some of the uh familiar enemies like um these are all new enemies but you know like the Moto bug or something. Well earlier in the last level we played I saw the I don't know the name of it but that like the the caterpillar thing yeah what's his name, Cat is think Caterkiller; The Caterkiller why not?

That that oh God, this little dude is just getting you sp... just CL, you're right. See? So okay, so we've been playing the two new levels so far, but earlier in other builds, stuff we've seen Green Hill Zone. Um, how's this game kind of like? Is it just the same levels or are they remixed and changed up at all? So we have several uh familiar zones from like Sonic 1, 2, 3, even CD uh in the game, but uh you know the the levels are actually remastered and it's a little new. Um, it's using this uh similar assets; we recreated all the assets, and so it's it's going to have an updated look to it, but God, whoever played you know Green Hill is going to recognize Green Hill, but D the level is",

You got to press... you got to press the button. I'm pressing the button. There we go. There we go. So if you jump, you got to do it again.
