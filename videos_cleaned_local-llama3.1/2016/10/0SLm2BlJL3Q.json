The studio had a special connection to the heritage of PlayStation last generation. As before launching Sleeping Dogs, the studio created ModNation Racers and LittleBigPlanet Karting, which were both PS3 exclusives. We wish nothing but the very best to all those who were affected by the closure and hope everyone lands on their feet soon. As I said on Colin and Greg when this was announced - or this news wasn't really announced, but just kind of came forward - this is an independent studio in British Columbia that's been around for a while. I feel like Square Enix is partially responsible for this. Square Enix, of course, funded Sleeping Dogs. Sleeping Dogs ended up being a critical hit and I think commercially did pretty well. They re-released it on the new consoles and they should have made a sequel.\"",

I think it ruined the studio, but of course, that's just an absolute conjecture; I don't have any insight into that. I haven't even spoken to anyone at United Front Games in three years probably. They were working on a game called Smash and Grab, which was on Steam Early Access, which I think was taken down.

Gamespot dug up an interview with two left sticks conducted with voice actor Brian Bloom who plays Wolfenstein protagonist BJ Blazkowicz there; he said quote: \"If you look at Bethesda's E3 2016 lineup, there was a title hinted that in a cool way - it sparked a bit of wildfire, that subtle very simple DOS language going through the titles perhaps we're\"",

When looking through the trophy list, it appeared to be relatively easy to Platinum without too much grinding involved. As I was marching towards completing the game as well as all the trophies, I realized something that I thought very interesting. The platinum trophy could be achieved without beating the game. During my final battle with Horizon, the last trophy that I needed popped on my screen: (kill 50 spawn) followed by that beautiful notification of the Platinum trophy again. This happened during the final battle of the game. Is this something you've seen often over the years?
