I mean everyone's getting kind of prepared people are hitting waivers going back to the AHL so it's exciting kind of oh always this is the most kind of time you know, Dangle everybody sharpening their skates everybody sharpening their skates they sharpen their own skates in the they take their stick and they bend it just a little bit at the top get the little cage going on there that's already done but uh you can't have an illegal Bend in your stick so you know what I mean like there is a lot of gray area in hockey in the rules, I think you'll admit as we've brought up many a time icing no one really knows what it is so that's only called maybe 50 to 75% of it's like holding in the NFL where it's all it's happening all the time but just it",

I watch the Jets have a really ferocious front seven and I'm watching players literally get tackled by the offensive line and just not get no call. It's like come on man. Yeah, you, yeah, yeah. It's another one of those moments where it's never stopped us before. Jets, man. Colin, it does me well to see you. I haven't seen you in quite some time. Has it been that long? But yeah, it's good to see it feels like it's been a long time. How much Dragon Quest Builders have you played? None. I mean, I've had it for several weeks. God, Colin, it has delivered.

Since then, though production is proceeding smoothly, the landscape for the release date has changed dramatically. Gravity Rush 2 is the conclusion of Kat's Journey, so we want players to have enough time to dive deep into our story. In addition, as a lot of work went into the online features that allowed for asynchronous player interaction, we want as many people as possible playing the title at the same time.
