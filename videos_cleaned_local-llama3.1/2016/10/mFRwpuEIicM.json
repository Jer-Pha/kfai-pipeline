It's an eagle that was in Colin's intro in a Kinda Funny Live one I used VideoBlocks extensively in Kinda Funny Live ones and two, but no one would know if you used Kinda Funny Live this was one; this was in the intro to one I've before, but anyways, Video BLX is awesome. And in addition to video, there's also audio stuff - there's graphics stuff. If you're a nerd like me that edits a lot of videos or you're just looking at cool pretty vistas, yeah, here they are.

No, I'm not even kidding about that. So he pushed it back in. I was like, \"Great, so I'll just do that,\" and then it got worse. Then I had to lay down, rest, ice it, and push it back there's a book you can read or research online to manage it, similar to Tim's Patreon book. Yeah, I jumped to the end, and it just said \"don't get one.\" So I got the surgery. The amazing part about this is he gets the surgery, and I was like, \"Oh, let me see the scars right?\" And he lifts up his shirt, and I'm like, \"This is interesting because for the first time in probably 20 years, Matt has chest hair now because he can't shave in this area.\"",
