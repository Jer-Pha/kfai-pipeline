Yeah, great. How much did you play? Just the multiplayer we did with Roo Teeth so an hour there, whatever. Yeah, yeah. So that was fun. I, I played the F the prologue bit and I finished the whole first war story, so there's five total, and man it's awesome like the vignettes are super cool. I love that the way they're introduced. I completely agree with you. I think the prologue is uh very powerful and it does a really good job of kind of using the um the jumping from person to person as they die to introduce you to different gameplay elements, and I like that it gives you a little bit of everything, and uh you each character dies in such a gruesome way and I feel.",

I played through that and it does say you're going to die, you won't continue on this way so to get in there and know you're in this losing battle but how long can you last before it all goes to hell?

But they do even just from the first one, there's like little twists and little things that happen, and I'm like, \"Man, like there's something really satisfying about it.\" It took probably an hour or 10 minutes to beat the first war story; there's something satisfying about the contained story. Um, I feel like the vignettes offer a really unique perspective into campaign design, where we're so used to getting this for shooters, like 8 to 15 hour experience, where you're just kind of doing the things and your character kind of develops over time, and like you have troops and stuff.

And it's just funny like we talked about The New Order a lot back in the day of not taking too long to put a gun in your hand and like the time to fire is a really important thing in a shooter and in games - how long does this game let you play or until it lets you play? And Wolfenstein really suffered from that. What I thought was ironic about Battlefield was it doesn't suffer from that at all, puts a gun in your hands immediately, and then it takes it out of your hands. That was in a way even worse - I want to shoot, the gun feels so good, using these kind of very antiquated early 20th-century guns compared to like when we were using M1s and all these other things in World War II, it just felt cool.
