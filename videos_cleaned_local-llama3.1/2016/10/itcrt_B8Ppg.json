And I think that they did that with Conker, they did that um uh with Eternal Darkness and some other games where it's like oh like this is weird. And they later did it with Gamecube when Resident Evil 4 came out there, like that was such a out of left field move but you know did it pay off? Who knows?

And then there was Starcraft 64, which was a horrible game, cuz how you going to play that with the N64 controller?

No Oxford comma backhand and forehand shots are determined by how you've positioned your player in front of the incoming ball, and serving is all about timing your button strike of choice. A X is a flat serve; circle is a slice serve, and triangle is an underhand serve. You now know how to rock at Hot Shots tennis. Go forth and melt faces. Sounds like a piece of cake right?

Granted, it's only $30, but when we get down to it, the title is asking its simple gameplay to be the sole reason you keep playing. You can't customize your character's appearance or stats, so it's going to come down to beating the heck out of everyone in an attempt to unlock some umpires you're never going to use.

My choice would be the Wild Hunt from Witcher 3 or the Elusive Man in the Mass Effect series - a good choice, um, I mean, I jump and we just mentioned it, so maybe that's why. But David, The Last of Us - he was a great villain; he was a great foil; he was creepy as all hell. You know what I mean? He was a different kind of villain too in the way that he wasn't like some bulky boss; he was just this little creepy dude. You know what I mean?

And Uncharted always has cool villains, but then their bosses are the battles always suck so much that I would never want to put them in there. Same thing with Infamous - if we're going that far back, I mean Kessler was cool, I thought I enjoyed what Kessler was doing. But like you know what was her name in The Second Son? Oh um uh no, that's Con... no, that's right, Delsin's friend, it starts with a C - Cole or Constantine sounds right, yeah Constantine that's not it, but yeah something like that.

I mean we remember NoD Dog getting purchased in 2004 and uh Soccer Punch getting purchased in 2009 and uh or 2011 actually it was right before Infamous 2, I think; um, and uh so you know. But we still have studios that are independent, that is, I'm surprised Haven't been purchased. I can't believe Q*bert's creator, Quan Dreams, is still independent; I can't believe Housemarque is still independent.

Although they had a few on or a couple on Wii U, I think that people liked it to a lesser degree than Splatoon, to a massive degree, and then a lesser degree some people liked like you know Captain Toad and all these other things. So I think that they exist there but I think that you know it reminds me more of the 3DS where a lot of the new IPs on 3DS are coming from third party. Um, I think that the relationship has to kind of go like that. But I agree with you, I think Nintendo misses Rare, and I think Rare has never been the same since they're done.

Chel Keller says what's up guys, long time first time. In recent years, there's been an anti-pre-order movement spurred on by a portion of the market and gaming personalities. I see the points to both sides of the controversy. First, I can understand publishers getting sight of their early sales numbers and then putting less effort into developing a quality product. On the other side, pre-ordering - hard pre-ordering, hard-to-get items like the Wii U gamepad adapter - can make for a much easier purchasing process for individuals. My question is: could you gentlemen please discuss the positives and negative effects of pre-ordering games and what it does to our industry, and your opinions on",

Keep up the stellar content. No, no publisher seeing pre-order numbers high and then saying work on the game less - that's not happening, so that's not the AR, that's not an issue, although I agree with you, it's publishers aren't making development choices based on pre-order six months out when the game has been developing for two years; it's a gestation period. Um, my take on this is I think it's good to reserve and pre-order hardware, and I think that when he brought up the battery, nobody's argued that either - yeah, like hardware is fine; we have pre-orders on VR and all those kinds of things, I'm sure people have their Neo VR or the Neo pre-orders in, and I think that that's totally fine.

So you can make sure your $60, your hard-earned $60, is getting spent in the right way. So I think pre-ordering is embarrassing, specifically because not embarrassing for people to do, but embarrassing for publishers to put out there: \"Pre-order here and get this special thing!\" Shut up, like why are you doing that to people? You know, when they don't know anything about your game. I think it's a little bit predatory.

You want better games journalism, but you don't want to stop and wait for reviews and then base decisions off of that, and have a more critical edge or taste in it. The pros of pre-ordering are getting the game right away, like when I pre-ordered Batman: Arkham Knight - they didn't send us codes, so I had pre-loaded it and wanted it immediately at midnight to play it. We did a stream for it. The benefit is getting it right away, if you've been around long enough, you can watch gameplay trailers and demos, like the 20-minute E3 demo, and be like \"that's something I want now\".
