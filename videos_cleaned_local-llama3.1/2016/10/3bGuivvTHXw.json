Hell yeah, now you guys are both obsessed with it. I want to hear your stories; you have two different perspectives. We got the craft guy, we got the Dragon Quest Guy. Where do we meet? Where's the consensus? I think it's awesome. Colin, do you like it? Yeah, I don't know that it's awesome, but I think it's a great game. I mean, for me, exactly what I wanted. It's we talk about this all the time: games not delivering on your expectations for them right? Uh, from the time I we first heard about Dragon Quest Builders and it was going to be some weird RPG mashup with Minecraft, I was like, \"And it's going to be on Vita; I was like, 'This sounds like the perfect game to have on mute and watch TV with and fool around with and build something out, and and it's done that to a tea for me right?

Where you know in the very beginning you start with just these you know empty boxes on the bottom of your screen which you filling with the materials you're collecting or whatever you're doing. But then you know you build your own chest. I was like, okay great, I'm building these chests; I'll be able to put this stuff in there, like Minecraft. If I put two chests together, they'll become one big chest. Okay, no they don't. Do that. There's still many chests. But when I go to craft, I don't need to take out of the chest what I want at the crafting station; it knows that back in that chest I have a whole bunch of sand so I can make some glass.

I think I would enjoy it even more if there was a quest log, if there were the challenges weren't so vague, and like I don't understand the the reasons why in a game that has such significant localization and a lot of translation in the game that they didn't just go the extra step in the original game to make a quest log to. And that was really weird, that's what I was telling Greg is like Dragon Quest 9 was the last Dragon Quest game that came out in the states and that game came out on on DS and uh or 3DS I guess no it was DS and right 9 yeah yeah DS um and uh I I felt like I was telling Greg I'm like that game was so side quest heavy that there were literally there are hundreds of them and the game numbered them like like you go into your log and be",

Like, you don't, and I found that I was I've been reading a lot about the game too, um, hoping that there was some information from the Japanese version, in Japan it was on PS4, PS3, and so a lot of people played it over there, and um, I was like looking for information and reading about things, and it's like, \"Yeah, like chapter by chapter your **** just disappears like nothing,\" you do in chapter one has anything to do with chapter 2, like, and I'm like that.",

I mean, that's basically the essence of a role-playing game; that's the essence of a lot of games. And Dragon Quest was always really good at it. So when games came along in the genre, like Lunar or something like that, where the enemy scaled and all stuff, it kind of frustrated me because I was like, \"Well, what's the point of even leveling then?\" You know? And it's... I got a similar feeling here, which is unfortunate, because Dragon Quest isn't about this.
