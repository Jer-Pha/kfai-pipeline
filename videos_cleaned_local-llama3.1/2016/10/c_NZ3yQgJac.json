I think we got our codes before we talked about...I love you. I was freaking out, I was so happy - Hot Shots Tennis is finally a PS2 classic that I'm super anxious to get back to, actually play because God forbid they put out a Hot Shots Tennis on PlayStation 4. They announced Hot Shots Golf on PS4, it's apparently next year...come on man, where the hell is it? Clap hands! You know what I need - but Hot Shots Tennis comes to PlayStation 2 classic. Hot Shots Tennis has trophies. Greg Miller is excited. Download it, get caught up in life last night, sit down and play a bunch of games, beat the Batman games, right?

Circle is your slice and triangle is your lob. No Oxford comma. Backhand and forehand shots are determined by how you've positioned your player in front of the incoming ball. In serving is all about timing your button strike of choice. A X is a flat serve, circle is a slice serve, and triangle is an underhand serve. You now know how you now know everything you need to rock at Hot Shots Tennis. Go forth and melt faces. Sounds like a piece of cake right? Well it is and it isn't. I took June, an oh so cute brunette in a white in a little white tennis ensemble through the ranks.

Here, stats are limited to the game telling you if your choice for the game is a baseline net or all-around player, and then rating a player serves stroke volleys and more. The catch: you can't influence those stats. Fall in love with June like I did, great! But even if you get yourself to the top tier of classes, don't expect to be able to get a stroke out of the gutter as far as modes go, there are three: Challenge, Training, and Funtime Tennis. Challenge is just you playing matches to unlock stuff; Training should be self-explanatory; and Funtime is just you choosing to play with or against friends of the computer. Where are the mini games?
