A message he wanted to improve upon the Xbox One console and is definitely done so with the Xbox One S and presumably the Xbox One X. Now, he said the focus is on games, and that triple-A exclusives are coming. It's apparent that the reason they're there is a lack of exclusives as of late into the Xbox One's life cycle. A lack of console exclusives so late into the Xbox One's life is that Phil is bringing his vision for Xbox to fruition.
