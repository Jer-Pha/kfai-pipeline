Disney's cable networks such as ESPN make up the majority of the company's earnings however that proportion has fallen in recent years as viewers changed the way they consume entertainment. The new streaming services are a way to connect directly with consumers and take advantage of new viewing habits. To end that, Disney is paying $1.58 billion for majority ownership of BAMTech. You got to say it like you said before, BAM Tech - there it is! Thank you.

Okay cool, we know what Disney movies are. The ESPN-branded sports service will offer about 10,000 events a year, including programming with regional, national, and international games. Disney's plans for its own streaming service come as ESPN has struggled with a drop in subscribers and ad revenue, as well as a round of high-profile layoffs and departures at ESPN early this year.

Why would they syndicate this out to Netflix and Amazon when they could take some of that market share away from them and go into it themselves?
