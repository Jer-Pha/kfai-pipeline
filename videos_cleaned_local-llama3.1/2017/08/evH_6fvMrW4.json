Good morning, run me through where this outfit came from. I was in Montreal months ago and saw one of those cat collared shirts and did yeah you know this thing where you take a photo of something because you don't actually want to buy it for somebody, you send the photo like I send it to Cindy Tang or whatever because I saw that in Scott L's wife reminded me of it. Where did you get this? Um, I actually got this from a thrift store but I believe it can be found on ModCloth which is a website. Interesting yeah yeah um yeah so for people who are listening I'm wearing a black shift dress with a white collar but the white collar is in the shape of a cat so the face is on one side and the feet are on the other because it's International Cat Day. Oh, is it really? Yes, it is. I didn't realize that and I have two",

I didn't realize that. And I have two tuxedos which are also black and white. Yep, yep, yep; they are adorable. Good. What are their names? Maverick and Ghost. Great. Now bring me up to speed on what the hell is going on with Paragon. I've seen you go right off on Twitter about it. We were getting ready for the update, you weren't excited for the update. I guess the update's live now; is that what happened? Technically, the update isn't live because they had to bring the servers down because the game melted. Okay, okay. I saw that. I saw you quote tweeting that today. Not pulling any punches, no. Um, I mean, you want to get into this right now? Yeah, sure. So here's the thing: um, they've been promoting v42 for a long time\u2014uh, for at least a couple of weeks\u2014and saying, you know, they're really excited about the new update.",

Um, I had the opportunity to play it; we talked a little bit about it on the show. Um, I was logged on this morning to get everything loaded because I'm planning to stream later today, uh, with the new update, and um, I was entered into a queue. I tweeted a photo, a screenshot of the queue; it was over seven hours long. The queue... you sit in the queue; it'll be ready by the time you're ready to stream. Well, you would think except in the five minutes that I sat there tweeting about this queue, I got kicked from the queue three times, and by the fourth time I got re-entered into the queue, it had jumped up to nine hours long.

We're going to piggyback off that Metroid uh Samus Returns let's play because during it, and cuz I guess I broke embargo oops, and I didn't know about it no, and you heard it on Kinda Funny Games Daily, and no one really called me on it which was interesting. During the let's play of the Samus Returns uh uh DS game they were a 3DS game, they're showing the amiibo's and like, and this one unlocks a new mode, and I went hard mode, and she goes no, hard mode is in the game, hard mode is in this game from the beginning.

You said, \"Oh yeah,\" and I'm like, \"Actually, it's Fusion Mode.\" You're like, \"Whatever, we just went on because I was like, 'I have no idea what that is.'\" Because I thought it was under see if you... If you watch this, it would be well. I didn't think anything of it; I thought, \"Oh, I got this wrong,\" and this is information that everybody already knew again. Like the long and short of this story is the fact that man did they bungle this announcement? Man, was this a weird way to roll out any of this information? Nintendo bungled an announcement.

But yeah from the get-go announcing this and being like every everybody's like kept asking \"is hard mode locked behind this amiibo\" and they said keep looking at the Facebook page, the Facebook page has the information, look at the Facebook page that's all they'd say. So everyone ran with this story that you had a normal mode and then to unlock hard mode you needed these amiibos when in reality no, you play through, you beat normal mode, you unlock a hard mode but then if you get the new Metroid amiibo, you then unlock this Fusion mode which is harder than hard mode and gives you this new Fusion suit.

Yeah, the US gamer and when they were talking about it goes in deeper than the content Fusion mode of course this uh challenging campaign, the fusion suit. This will not be offered as a separate DLC in Nintendo's digital eShop at any point, so clarification on a story that continues to evolve. I did you know you said it once; you said it was crazy and then it kept popping up; it kept popping up. Maybe now we're finally done with it; maybe maybe you don't know until the game comes out.

Yeah, yeah, no, that and that's why it's fascinating to see the hypotheticals we've talked about for so long actually happening here, and it's the same thing like you're talking about LawBreakers; Hellblade is going to sell exponentially better because it has all this great buzz. It's not a $6 game, I mean think about it - this happened to Ninja Theory when they put out Heavenly Sword, and people were like, \"Oh, it was good,\" but it didn't feel like a you know, it didn't live up to like what your expectations of a AAA Sony exclusive, uh, $60 game supposed to be.

It seems like the popularity of the NES classic and other retro consoles is a cool idea to have a brand new experience that still has the feel of those collections. It does have me a bit worried though I love Spelunky and Downwell, and I'm not sure many of these games will have that kind of depth or appeal to me. However with a likely low price even three great games out of 10 good ones would still be worth it.

Of course, without disregarding the old adage that sequels sell more, I still can't help think that the Switch has officially become the second chance a lot of Wii U titles needed. My question is: through the switch, do you think Nintendo has officially made a comeback not only with their reputation or numbers but also with the quality of life the switch can offer game developers? I certainly hope so, since this is the first Nintendo console I've ever owned. Thanks, this show is too good y'all XOXO Jeremiah J. Is this the redemption of Nintendo? Not yet, really.
