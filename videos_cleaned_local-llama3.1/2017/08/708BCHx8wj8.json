Cobra Kai is a dope ass name, a brand new sequel to the 1984 classic The Karate Kid is on the way, and this one like the first three films stars Daniel LaRusso himself, Ralph Macchio. It's a streaming show called Cobra Kai and will also star William Zabka, best known as playing the evil Johnny Lawrence in the original film; he's the star of the show, which takes place in modern times, 30 plus years after the original film.

Okay, still awesome. You still have me all of which from a pure nostalgic point of view sounds incredible. But here's where it gets a little weird: first, Cobra Kai is described as a 10-episode half-hour comedy; second, the show will be exclusive to YouTube Red, YouTube's premium subscription service.
