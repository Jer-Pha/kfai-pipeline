I go, I read the Reddit a lot; I know a lot of people, not a lot of guys, really write and leave feedback a lot. I'll be honest, I'm the person who probably reads the least amount of feedback, but I do love reading feedback on the actual videos themselves. So it's about a video, please put it in the comments, and if there's a thread on Reddit for it, I will for sure see that. If not, I'm sure Joey usually sees everything; he brings it to my attention, and we talk about it internally. And so like that, so I do apologize if I don't actually get out there more to talk to people about what's going on or the feedback that I see. But I do see a lot of it, and I do try to incorporate that into what we're doing.

You discussed on either GOG or The Morning Show about your dream to make a direct-to-movie somewhere down the line, which brings me to my question: what kind of movie do you want to make - action, comedy, drama, etc.? I also want to say as a huge fan of stand-up comedy, you are hilarious and I can't wait to see your progress. PS, you've got to go on Rogen's podcast and hopefully there's some Kinda Funny crew to keep up the spectacular work. I love movies; I do love movies. Recently, I think that you know stand-up comedy has taken a little bit more of a presence in my life just because it's fun - it's something that I can get there and go do, and it directly relates to what I'm doing here, so I can look at myself doing stand-up, look at myself in a panel, look at myself in the",

Well, at this point I just feel like everyone's scared of me. I feel like Greg specifically is just a giant vagina, you know, and then I think he'll never get the belt back; he knows that he doesn't want to challenge me for the belt because he's lost so many times.
