I'm going to see Nintendo at PAX next weekend. Oh, Mr. Nintendo, don't say it what's up to me? Well, I don't know if Mr. Nintendo will be there. Oh, I mean are you going to be...

Does that sound pissy and extreme? It does, and I know that, but as a consumer there's often very little you can do other than vote with your wallet even if it doesn't actually amount to anything Nintendo is pissing into the faces of its most hardcore fans with the SNES Classic, and they clearly don't even care. And sometimes I just wish the company would fold. There are among the most anti-consumer companies in the games industry, and they just make me a little sick to my stomach sometimes. Hope everyone it Kinda Funny was able to get a hold of some pre-orders have a great day he admits it but that is a very extreme response to it yes",

Yeah, so Tony wrote in; I'm not going to read his entire statement here because it was kind of long, but he asks: do you think it's a collector mentality that makes everyone want one so bad?
