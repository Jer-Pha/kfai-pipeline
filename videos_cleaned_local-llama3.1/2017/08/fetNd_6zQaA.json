Big Kev, dog, in here - required reading of course, ladies and gentlemen: Spider-Man Blue. Now, you have heard us talk about Spider-Man Blue before because as the DC Fanboy who's trying to get more into Marvel, I talked about my limited experience with Marvel leading into this, and how I loved Spider-Man Blue. To which Tim Gettys' Spider-Man Super Fan said, \"I don't like that book; it's not as good as it's cracked up to be.\" That I just said it was overrated - that's what I said.
