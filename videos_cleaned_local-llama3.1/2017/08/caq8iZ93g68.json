It was all unevenly cooked; it was tarted. They did like the Philly cheesesteak, you know? It's like really, really rare on the outside. Um, but it's it's a you can't have like 75 tables no yeah and and be cooking steaks you can't do that so they'll have big tubs or they have an infrared broiler just constantly going through. And it's what's an infrared broiler? I'm not sure. Infrared broiler is most grills have an infrared broiler, okay. Um, super high heat but it's it's uh instead of using like flame it's using infrared as the source of heat and so it cooks more accurately, okay. Um, so the whole thing is about precision cooking but it's it's French you know? So the French can cook maybe Outback's house.",
