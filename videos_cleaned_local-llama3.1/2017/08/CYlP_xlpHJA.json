Six is Letty's back, do you think about that and that's why five is key to it really took the family to the next level so then when six had to face a rival family things are gonna get real okay now six I liked because they were like up until that point it had been about like souped up new cars right. And then in six, that's when Tej goes and buys like he's a millionaire right so he goes and buys all the classic cars - and how all those badass like old 60s and 70s cars there is no one in London right also Paul Walker goes to jail oh go to go to find Braga yeah",

Dominic crashes a helicopter by like shooting at it. It's the thing about seven; it is the most crazy set pieces that is the most over-the-top the series has ran thus far. Not true because then we get eight and we get a friggin' submarine as a vehicle that they can go through. When that car went from building to building, having cars, yes.

I'm sorry; I wish I had Jonathan Taylor Thomas thought it no because I would've been amazed or what I understand the beginning is it we're gonna call that a vignette of that movie.
