We were trying to do something completely different; we were trying to do something that this genre of movie has never seen before. We kept running into the same problems, and then Deadpool and Logan came through and kicked the doors down. Now we're really getting to do some things we've always wanted to do with the script. We just sort of started over. Okay, well, this movie ever happening? I mean, I would think yeah. Here's what I'll say: I think yes it will happen. It's just...
