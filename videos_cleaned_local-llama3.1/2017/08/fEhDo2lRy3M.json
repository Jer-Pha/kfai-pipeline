I think there were parts of that where we were all admittedly old, yeah it was time but I think that was the good thing about this group is that no one really pushed each other to be like \"hey, let's do something crazy\" so you know. We flew in on Friday afternoon, everyone flew in on Friday afternoon, it's best we got checked into the hotel, we went out and grabbed lunch there, and then we went over to the gun store to fire guns, yeah which ended up being a super fun bonding experience I think and ended up being a lot scarier than I thought it was going to be.

And my buddy Eric sprung for him to get the Coalition package, which included a squad automatic weapon, which is like a fully automatic, you know, the one that Rambo used to have. We're like, that's the bandolier, it's like it's like the newer version of that did they use in the military today? So we had that. But then we were like, we got to take it up a notch and we got him the 50-caliber gun, which I stand to this day is the gun that took down ED-209 in the original RoboCop. For visual reference, type \"M134\" rifle. What's that? Cuz it looked like a sniper rifle.
