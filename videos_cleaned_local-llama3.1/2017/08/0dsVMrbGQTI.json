You talk about a Zero Mission is its no mission on the Game Boy Advance, yeah, well, what, yeah. Don't the Game Boy Advance there was a Metroid Fusion and then Metroid Zero Mission, okay, zero mission was a remake of the first game, great. I think I like that way and I played on a trip that we went somewhere I can't remember probably Tahoe, probably Tahoe, yeah, yeah. I know that the the DS and GBA Game Boy games are ducks, well, sorry, the Game Boy and DS Castlevania games are more similar to Metroid than the old-school Castlevania games those are more action-oriented, more Shovel Knight, ask mmm cool, I want to get in Shovel Knight and I feel like I just haven't gotten like the right trip so I feel like hey I want it on the switch which is happening right it's already done, yeah.",

Yeah, Switch, oh all in the whole treasure trove. Yeah, don't get it? So hopefully when I fly to Italy that's one of the games that I'll be playing. You should, yeah. Paris, I'm flying to Paris. Usually you need Sonic Mania to keV. I really do. I do. And I probably missed an email somewhere, but so yeah, never been a big fan of that particular game, Shovel Knight. Shovel Knight's the one that's the one, but everyone says it's amazing, so I feel like if I dedicate enough time, I could fall in love with it. I just haven't, and I think that's my biggest problem also the Final Fantasy series; I've never enjoyed them. I had high hopes for this latest one, 15, and I just could not get into the playing style. Yeah, yeah, yeah, 15 was a rough one; it had so much potential, and it just didn't hit it in all the right places. The new one though",

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 15 was a rough one; it had so much potential, but it just didn't hit it in all the right places. The new one, though, that they announced today - the Pocket Edition. Yeah, uh, if they port that over to the Switch, I think it could be pretty good, really, because it seems like it's truncating, getting cutting a lot of the fat. I feel like that's what they said about 15, no, really. I thought 15 was supposed to make things, like, a lot smoother and feel more different, a game, yeah. Well, that is more action II, but I'm talking about just in terms - there's just a lot of just story beats and mismanaged plot devices that happen in 15. All right, so we've got a question from Dutcher in the Sneedeker. Okay, do you want to look at this? Just makes sense. Okay, he says, 'Hey Kevin, what do you admire most about your wife-to-be Paulo?'

About that game, the gameplay is 10 out of 10, 10/10, Addison, this game plays solidly, the game plays so solid that I really feel like it makes like forgivable that the story is not it just is sad because Metal Gear even at its low points is still the stories which are so maze about it as well the characters, yeah, yeah absolutely but I feel like that all comes",

It was solid one, loved it too. And then Snake Eater came out, and man, I was all about it. And then 4 and 5, and just it gets better and better - except for five's storyline, not so great. All right, thank you very much. See you next time. John Burleson says Kevin, congratulate son lock you down. Paula, thank you. Can you throw the story of how you met and started dating again? How you guys... man, started dating again? Yeah, yes we say so. Me and Paula, so alright, so let me take you back 2008 - hard to get a job, real hard time to get a job.

And I really was trying to find anything there, and I was super desperate. Like I went to every single store looking to see if they were hiring, and nobody wanted me because I had no experience doing retail. My sister used to work at a store that is called L'Occitane; it's actually still there. They sell French lotions and hand creams, and she decided that she was gonna move with her boyfriend and bought a place in Tahoe. And I used to go and hang out with them like every day, like I had like a really crazy secret schedule in 2008. Like all my classes were really far apart; it was freshman year fall of 2008. I had like five-hour breaks between my classes, so I'd go and hang out there with her and all the other co-workers, and eventually",

I think that one of the like, there's a game called Dark Souls which is a very, very simple game, it's like what 15 bosses or something, it might be less than that, maybe 13, all you have to do is go to them and fight the boss, and it's so insanely hard because it's just that, it's such a simple game where all the only options you have are - move around and shoot an arrow, but for me, the most satisfaction in gaming is figuring out how to defeat your opponent, and it's one of the reasons why I like racing games so much because there is like a curve of like, \"oh man\"",

So but Tim also seems like the kind of kid and like I don't remember a whole bunch of stuff in my past 'cause I don't sleep, and like the flux of your memory... I feel like Tim made me wash my hands before using his controller cool Greg does that sound familiar at all? Sounds like 1% what he used to do. Yeah, yeah, but I don't think was just me; I think primarily me, but I'm sure that he did it to a couple other people too. But like Tim always had the new console; I always felt like when I went to Tim's house, all right, I get to play the PS2 or oh man, I'm playing the N64... The N64 probably wasn't new when he bought it, like it felt super new, and he always wanted everything to be pristine. So yeah, I probably had to wash my hands all the time before using his controller, and I'd probably just despite him not wash my hands and be like, \"Oh man, there's...\"",
