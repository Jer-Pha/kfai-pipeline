So bad that Demian Maia was shooting in for the same takedown over and over again. He shot in for 21 takedowns, and all 21 of them were stuffed pretty much with relative ease. You could tell that he was like, \"I'm just going to train specifically to stuff these takedowns.\" It got so bad that at one point Demian, the announcers were like, \"Are his knees bleeding from shooting?\" Because when you shoot in for a takedown, you shoot a knee first, so you scoop it up and grab double leg takedowns.

Dana White came out, chairs in it was a bad fight, but the problem is that's how you win fights and that's how you stay on top right? You don't win fights by getting in there and smash and letting someone smash your face in until you knock them out, that's a bad way to win fights.

Cool, so that's what you're training for, and that's why it was most interesting to me because they set that up, and then once it started, I was like, \"This is so interesting. They're really sticking to that, and it's obvious that they trained against this and are ready and prepared.\" But I'm like, \"That's where the WWE fakeness comes in,\" where I'm like, \"They would have told that story in a way that wasn't boring.\" Is all it hopefully?

Like when Joe Rogan came up, interviewing him, all you heard was \"Bo\" like Goddamn Savage, it was savage. So what about the main event? The main event was so interesting, like I was completely nervous when it started when they started fighting cuz I was... oh no for Daniel Cormier really yeah I was actually more nervous for Jon, excuse me, not Daniel Cormier because there's because it's an interesting dynamic.

He fought Anderson Silva recently when Jon was supposed to fight him but Jon got popped for steroids. Anderson Silva came in; they had a great fight, but he didn't overwhelm him; he showed a lot of respect to his opponent and like showed a lot of respect to the sport. Then you've got Jon Jones who is just this phenomenally talented human being that won the youngest ever light heavyweight title to win the title just did **** he's like the kind of guy that like watched the YouTube video about Bruce Lee, and then can all of a sudden **** do a spinning back kick and do it and really do it and like actually",

Number two was a split between Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill Volume 1, but I'm going to give it to Kill Bill Volume 1 for me.

Kill Bill: Volume Two is seven. And you know what? Now that I'm looking at that, I'm going to switch those. Hay-Z is going to be seven; Kill Bill 7 way too um... Jackie Brown is eight, and uh Death Proof is nine because I really didn't like Grindhouse all that much. Actually, I liked Grindhouse but I didn't like Death Proof.
