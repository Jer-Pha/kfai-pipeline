He posted a screencap of a letter that he wrote on Instagram saying, \"Last week it was announced that I would be playing Major Ben Daimio in the upcoming Hellboy reboots. I accepted the role unaware that the character in the original comics was of mixed Asian heritage. There's been intense conversation and understandable upset since that announcement, and I must do what I feel is right. It is clear that representing this character in a culturally accurate way holds significance for people.\"",

It is clear that representing this character in a culturally accurate way holds significance for people, and that to neglect this responsibility would continue a worrying tendency to obscure ethnic minorities' stories and voices in the arts. I feel it is important to honor and respect that. Therefore, I've decided to step down so the role can be cast appropriately. Representation of ethnic diversity is important, especially to me as I have a mixed heritage family. It is our responsibility to make moral decisions in difficult times and to give voice to inclusivity. It is my hope that one day these discussions will become less necessary, and that we can make and help make equal representation in the arts a reality. I'm sad to leave Hellboy, but if this decision brings us closer to that day, it's worth it. I hope it makes a difference with love and hope Ed Skrein says he was",

I've seen I mean I follow a fair amount of people in different bubbles and different perspectives on all this stuff, but I'm saying there's a lot of backlash from the far left side just like oh you're only doing this to get headlines and to make yourself even more of a martyr.
