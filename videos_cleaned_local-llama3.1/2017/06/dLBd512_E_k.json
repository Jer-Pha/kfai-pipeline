There are also the PC collections, so there are many ways to play those games. Um, I recommend that for sure. I feel like especially Vice City is like required gaming when it comes to PS2 era. You agree with me on that? Big K Dog missed that on the question one more time, bud. Huh? Miss Vice City is required reading for PS2. Oh yeah, 100%. It's so good. So definitely think you got to get in there. I'm just trying to think of like the big iconic PS2 games they were all remastered. There I'd say Devil May Cry is up there and that was remastered, so Contra can be played there. Connectica is not on the list of must-plays unfortunately. Do you know the funny story about Contra?

With the uh ads, I have to open it up and okay, so Okami... but no, Okami was remastered. Katamari Damacy - I'm not sure if that was Master, I don't think it was. I actually missed out on those games myself. Kingdom Hearts - like I was saying, the Jak and Daxter games, Metal Gear Solid, and Shadow of the Colossus are huge ones, but those were remastered. God of War was remastered, yeah! No, honestly, I think you're good - luckily Sony did a really good job of making sure that the games that could have been stuck there made the jump.

We did our predictions episodes for the E3 show; I predicted a lot of get-hyped moments, but I was disappointed by most. I didn't get uh, Devil May Cry 5 or the Remake 2, or all these things that I was like crazy about, or PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, or Cart Racer, that I was dreaming of. But we did hear that Metroid Prime 4 is actually happening, so get hyped, son.

So I don't know, it'll probably be bigger. I don't think we're going to get a Witcher 3-esque Pok\u00e9mon game, although **** that would be awesome. But I do think it's just going to be more of the same but bigger. So we'll see, but that excites the hell out of me. Jack Simpson says hello from Australia, Tim. Since there's been a lot of PS2 and PS1 Classics poured out on the PSN as of late, were there anything in particular you hope for from that era to play on your PS4? Thanks, PS Kevin.

I realized that I loved video games, and that there was just a magic to them, and an emotional connection I had with them that I would carry with me. Because later that day, I went to Great America, which is this theme park we have here, and it's the theme park closest to us. So I have a lot of fond memories about that. But I remember, especially when you're a little kid, theme parks are the most magical things in the world. It's just like, how is this real?

I mean, I'm with you in the way that I prefer single-player experiences; I don't like this whole social gaming thing, but we are in the minority when it comes to that. So many people love it, and I feel like developers are getting better and better about understanding the balance of how those games work. In the last couple years, there's been so much microtransaction ****, so much always-online ****, all this stuff. But I feel like with every step, it's getting more and more uh quality of an experience, and while I'm never going to commit to doing that type of stuff, I'm",

Brawl was probably the game I played the most hours of, because that game came back into my life in about four different waves - when we had the Japanese version for countless hundreds of hours and then when it came to America a month later, we played it again for like a whole summer just every day, so that was a lot there and then we stopped, then we came back to it when I went to college and then we came back to it again when I got a job at IGN and we would play it every day after work. So yeah, probably Smash Bros Brawl. Let's see... Kingdom Hearts - I've never cared for the series; when I semi-wanted to try it out, all the remakes and re-releases confuse me on where to start in recent years Disney acquired the rights to Anastasia Kingdom.",

In recent years, Disney acquired the rights to Anastasia. Kingdom Hearts 3 has been in development for who knows how long. What do you think is the likelihood of Anastasia characters being in the game? And do you think it'd be necessary to play some of the previous entries for someone unfamiliar with the series? There's a 0.0% chance of Anastasia or any of the Anastasia characters being in Kingdom Hearts 3. Um, I'm sorry, but that is way too obscure and not Disney, even if they bought it. That's like saying we're going to see The Muppet Movie in the game, although that would be dope. Kingdom Hearts... man, I don't know; I don't know where the best jumping point is. Honestly, I kind of feel like there isn't a good jumping-in point. I feel like when three comes out it will be the most modernized core game, so I hope they do.",

So, I don't really think of it as behind or in front of camera; it's more just, can you do it? Can you make video? And I think a lot of people uh, that grew up in my age group feel the same way and are capable in the same way.
