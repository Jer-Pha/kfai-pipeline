I watched two things this weekend: TJ Miller's HBO special, \"Comedy Commando\" special, and I also watched for the first time \"Victor Frankenstein.\" Okay, yeah, I understood here - what's going on in my parents' house right now is that they've decided to switch to DIRECTV from AT&T U-verse, so their on-demand movies are a lot harder to find. So I was sort of forced to just kind of watch whatever's on TV. Now if you don't notice about HBO - when they make something new, they play it because they have 15 HBOs on some cable services.

It was contrasted to Victor Frankenstein, no that's Academy Award winner, yeah not Anna. It was cool, I liked your phrase, I just feel like there's our okay right. It was a fun concept, it's a fun way of putting that magnified story together. I just thought toward the end I got...I was like I don't know what's happening really and it's a little bit muddled.
