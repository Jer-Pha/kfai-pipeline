Greg Miller as well, we're trying something new today for the Twitch folks at the end of the live recording, I will stick around and read subs and tips because we've been missing some and we're trying to figure out a better way to do that.

Yeah, like I don't think that there's any way that they can get away from it. I think that they can just try to delay it as well. That's been the most like heartbreaking thing about this is. I think when we talk about the big publishers right, obviously there's the big three who make hardware; we don't even think about them. EA \u2013 oh, the most evil company in the world. Activision.

Like I thought Wildlands was a miss, but I appreciate that first off they make those kind of games. They make sure they find an audience with those kind of games for the most part. They support them. I know people right now - and this is me speaking from my very limited scope of what games I care about from Ubisoft - see other Division fans on The Division Reddit upset that they're not getting more updates, that this isn't happening. What's going on with the game? Um, but I appreciate that Ubisoft doesn't **** around (I assume \"doesn't ****\" is an idiomatic expression). I appreciate that they come out and they're like, \"With Assassin's Creed, we're going to make one every year.\" Somebody asked them years ago, \"Hey, are you going to make an Assassin's Creed every year?\" And they're like, \"We'll make an Assassin's Creed every year as long as you want us to.\"",

And of course, there are misses, and of course, there are a lot of fully buggy games. But it sounds like the last couple of misses they've had in terms of Division and Rainbow Six Siege coming out and being a little content light, they do over the year grow and add to it. That's a great example of it coming out and like, \"Hey, this is a game that everyone was super stoked about,\" and then, \"Oh, it seemed like the mainstream walked away from,\" but the core audience stayed, and they continue to add to that, to where now it is a game that you see on Twitch all the time.

I get it, you know what I mean, but they have franchises people want, they have audiences that want us, they want to take care of them. They make games for them; they stick around.

But that's the fear right there - is that Activision drops this because it can't be FR (it can't be annualized), that's not what I want to hear. Granted, Ubisoft makes annual franchises, but they usually make good games on those. The thing that bothers me the most about this is the fact that there's obviously a fight between the Heaton family and vendi. Yeah, obviously there are disagreements and their visions do not align.
