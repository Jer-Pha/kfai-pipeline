Saying I am counting in this if Battlefield or Battlefront 2 is like and we have PlayStation VR mode. Are you reading all five of your predictions? I was going to say that's not the way since I have the bonus, I'm throwing out then at I'm putting it's no longer a full prediction it's a star and this isn't even a prediction this is an example now that will no longer be used as a prediction.

I'm my thing with VR is I was thinking that Dreams would be the big VR thing that they that they push at all. And I do think that in addition to Star Wars Battlefront, there would be some type of like... cuz last year they showed Batman: Arkham and Final Fantasy and like all those things. There'll be a big game like that, like some something that's just like a big experience based on a triple-A game.

We've been way too long, there's been too many trademark leaks of this HD Collection. I don't think Shenmue 3 has much to be said about it but I do think that it's worth talking about just to get to the collection. Do you know? I think it's just way too much work to redo those games for such a small audience that would buy them. Sure, yeah. Has been doing it though we recently got the Bayonetta and Vanquish PC ports.

I think they'll just do their own thing but they kind of are right, they don't need to show their game at any of these events. Yeah, I mean 80 million units they've got, they've got quite a lot of cash that they can buy commercials with maybe it's the GTA online stuff and that's maybe it's a special case. But I also feel like they have been doing more outreach over the past year when it comes to like gaming communities and like Twitch broadcasters and stuff like that in a way that I couldn't imagine like Rockstar doing two years ago even so I don't know, I'm hopeful.

It's been a while since they've announced a new game that's 10 years out, so I think it might be time for Final Fantasy XVI - that's the Get Hype moment, but the prediction is either um Final Fantasy VII or Kingdom Hearts III trailer at I like if all of your picks are like five picks, at least two. I had a bonus pick, but it didn't attach to any of my other picks and that was that only Andrew House will be on stage, no one else. Oh okay, okay, was any other drama, anything? No, I cleaned out everything in there. Yeah, yeah cool all right, that is Sony what's up guys, that was fun.
