Like, any time you remember what video game tie-ins were like, it's just like these are throwaways, nobody wants disasters, but that was like one of the best DC Comics going on at the time. I remember when you did the interview back at E3, it was awesome. Yeah, well, it's the idea that you know the fact that they get to take chances on it and that's love to see with Injustice, and you wonder too if it's something to do with the fact that obviously superheroes are more popular than ever, but you do see it now where like they've been promoting Injustice 2 so much with Supergirl right because Supergirl has a TV show.

But I play this for the story, like that's awesome. That you've seen a game progress and push what a fighter is in terms of, hey, non-fighting game fans here's a reason to care. Here's a reason to get in there and get it. You're never going to be able to be competitive, and you're not going to be able to go online and do anything, but you can play through this and actually have a great story. Well, I mean that's the thing.

Where it reminds me of how Naughty Dog games make me feel, and where I'm like, \"Oh man, I'm going to care extra because you care extra.\" Sure. I mean, I don't think it's coincidence that I like Harley Quinn more now, and I think it's because of the way Tom Taylor has portrayed her in Injustice. You know what I mean? And the way they let this story play out is always plays to my argument, and I know this is a games podcast, but the fact that Comics should blow up continuity \u2013 you should let creators who want to have a cool story to tell go tell a cool story \u2013 and Justice's story starts at least in number one.",
