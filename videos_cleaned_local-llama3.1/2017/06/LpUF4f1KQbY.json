The Switch outsold the Xbox One and PS4 for two months in a row, April and May, but in June, the PlayStation 4 surpassed it. You assume because you can't get these parts from what it sounds like it's dot that makes a lot of sense because June so we saw I'm against June and again that seems like I'm pulling my information here that's a weird thing that maybe this is another one where I was wrong about the real issue last time around.
