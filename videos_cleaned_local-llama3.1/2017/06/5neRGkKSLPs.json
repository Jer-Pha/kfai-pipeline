Well, I went down to E3 Judges Week a while back and saw more than 30 E3 games ahead of the show, and like I said, these are the ones that wowed me. Okay, let's start with an easy one, Sonic Mania. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know; Tim has been talking about this one for a while, but this was my first time playing a bunch of the levels back to back to back.
