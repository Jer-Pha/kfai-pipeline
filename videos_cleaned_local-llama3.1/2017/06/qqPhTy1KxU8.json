We just saw Spider-Man, Marvel's Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 behind closed doors. Extended session of what we saw on stage along with Brian from Insomniac talking a whole bunch about the questions we have and how he could answer them, what we could get into, what he couldn't get into. Yeah, very similar demo. It was the same thing we saw at the PlayStation showcase with an added bit in the middle where in the showcase they had to save two people before the whole helicopter scene. In this one they saved three. They said in the final game there's actually going to be even more. Sure. When you have to say save Kingpin's men or whatever from getting their butts beat by the demons. Yeah. Did that. And then yeah. It was what was interesting for me was watching them fail if that makes sense. And the you know whenever you get a press conference demo it's polished. They",

And the you know whenever you get a press conference demo it's polished. They don't want to screw anything up. They don't miss any beats. This one was, \"What happens if I get punched and my combo meter breaks? What happens if I don't hit the right thing at the right time?\" That was interesting. I like seeing that in the chase scene where he's chasing the helicopter with the kind of like wrecking ball thing going on. There was a couple times where he didn't perfectly turn and it it did get a little farther away and it was like, \"Okay, cool.\" That it's not as scripted as it seemed in the the demo that we saw. So many people came away from that one saying it's all QGT. It's like, well, it isn't. It isn't. It seems like. So that is uh my one criticism with this game because oh my god it looks amazing is there in the bottom right of the the HUD constantly and you see",

There's like suggested things like oh you can purge here if you hit L2 and R2 or you can do a takedown move or oh do a finishing move and it's just like it makes the whole game seem like there's way more QTEs than there actually are. It's really only during the like cinematic chase scene where there's epic music playing and like it's trying to feel like a movie that that's not that was the thing is like when he when they were doing what I mean when it first started and we saw him like you know he lands you got this I got this and he goes and he takes out all the different guards in the demo that seemed originally like Arkham but then yeah it was like well this is all happening so fast what's happening to see somebody play screw it up it went",

It gave off that sense of this is what Spider-Man should be doing. I mean, that's the best thing that this game does is it nails the feeling of Spider-Man. And I feel like from the way he talks to the way he moves to the way he fights to the like action poses he does a lot. It's so genuine to what we think of Spider-Man and uh the creative director uh I think his name was Brian. Oh my god so passionate about this game. And it read so true from what he was saying where it was just like man he really cares to not only make this feel like Spider-Man but to make this feel like a new Spider-Man from the suit to the what villains he's facing. I like that Mr. negatives there. And that's a villain that not everyone knows. But he's like, \"All right, there's going to be the villain that people know.\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n- Added capitalization for proper nouns: Spider-Man\n- Corrected spelling error: \"Mr. negatives\" -> \"Mr.\" (assuming it's an abbreviation for Mister)\n- Left other text as is, including filler words and phrases, to maintain the original meaning and tone of the transcript.",

But we want this to be a new Spider-Man experience, but to still feel like it's Spider-Man to other people, but that means Peter Parker as well.\" So, they really went into detail about how this isn't just going to be Spider-Man. It's just as important to Peter Parker. And what I liked was they were talking about how in the demo they don't call him Mister Negative. They kept calling him uh Mr. Lee. And that's because Peter has a relationship with Mr. Lee. He runs the homeless shelters. That's where MA works. So, he already knows her and that's why he wanted to call him Mister Negative. Yeah.

What I liked about it is something Tim brought up. They talked more in depth than the behind closed doors. Tim brought it up during it, right, of like, oh, Peter was working with the cops in his ear. That was cool. The fact that they, you know, he's 23 years old. He's been Spider-Man for eight years. He knows what he's doing. He is a well, you know, he knows what he's doing as Spider-Man to get out there to have these fancy gadgets to do all these different things. That's what one of the meters was too. That was one of my questions. I saw the health meter, saw a web meter. I was like, what is that? It's for his gadget. Whichever active gadget he has equipped. Yes. Which makes it sound like there's going to be a lot of fun gadgets to keep things interesting. There'll probably be skill trees. Well, that was the",

They're like, \"Well, the combo meter to me suggests that I'm getting XP, which means that I'm\" And he's like, \"Ask me in a few months cuz I'm assuming, yeah, you're unlocking powers, you're unlocking abilities.\" Yeah. And they also somebody in our room asked about, \"Hey, are there going to be suits to unlock?\" And more on that. And they said, \"Customizing the suit you had, which for me is, you know, Brian said what we all know. It's a giant white spider suit to different.\" So you look at it at a glance, say it's Spider-Man, but it's not a Spider-Man. I love you, Insomniac. I hate that suit. I just I think that suit is ugly. Don't shake your head. Don't shake your head. Stop shaking your head, Kevin. He's shaking it harder, but no, it's like I just don't like that suit. I'm sure",

But I didn't even think about customized and I love that it seems like there's so much thought put into the story and the world that this game has says there's going to be a ton of characters in it which really excites me. I think that's something the Arkham games did really well was kind of have everybody Batman involved and I feel like they're really aiming to do that with Spider-Man. They said open world from the very beginning. You can go anywhere you want in Manhattan. Hands all open as soon as that's super exciting. I honestly like being in the room, it's like everyone was stoked and it's like everyone was like, \"Oh man, we got to be quiet. We can't be too hyped about this.\" But it was awesome.

Like even though like from the guy playing to the guy telling us to everyone there, it's like they are really nailing this game and I think they got something super special on their hands. It goes back to what I keep talking about with Marvel games, the fact that, you know, it's Bill and Mike and they're like, \"We're going to give talented developers our franchises and let them go.\" Like, you know, they Insomniac wouldn't answer how long they've been working on it. They didn't want to get into the weeds about it. It's it's their own Spider-Man universe. It isn't like there's no Marvel universe that everything has to tie into. Like, they're telling their Spider-Man tale. And they were talking about how Marvel is behind them as long as they justify whatever they're trying to do that they get in there and tinker. That's why Miles Morales is at the end of it, you",

That's why Miles Morales is at the end of it, you know? I mean, that's why Pete is doing what Pete's doing. Yeah. No. And I asked them during the thing, I was like, \"So, obviously Marvel Games has its universe going. Is this game a standalone thing or could it kind of work in with the Avengers game or whatever?\" And he was like, we're only thinking of it as our own thing. Who knows what the future holds, which excites me. But I like they're focusing. They're focusing though. Like I think that that's important. And I think that the amount of care that they're putting in this game is going to show 100%. Yeah. Well, there you go. 2018 way for E3 2017 coverage right here on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames.
