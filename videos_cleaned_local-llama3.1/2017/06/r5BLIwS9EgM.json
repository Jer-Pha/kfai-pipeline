It's an easy It's catchy. It's just unthreatening. Bubblegum rap. Every time you say Mike Shinoda, I think of my Chirona and I'm like, why is Tim keep bringing that song up? No, no, no.

He said, \"I had two screen I I had the two screenplays in front of me for for the Independence Day 2 and for Suicide Squad. I had to choose between the two of them those even the choice of going Suicide Squad. Nothing about the quality of the movie, but the choice of trying to go forward versus clinging and clawing backwards.
