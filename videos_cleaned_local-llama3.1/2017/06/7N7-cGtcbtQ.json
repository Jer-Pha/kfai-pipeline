Uh, they're kind of breaking it up, I guess, cuz they're looking at this post-Andy Samberg era. Um, Fred Armisen, Bill Hader, Seth Meyers, Taran Killam - this is where it gets starts getting pretty weak in my opinion. Uh, Jay Pharoah was on there doing his impressions and killing it for a while, Jay-Z though. The final era is the Kate McKinnon era, the most recent that's uh McKinnon, Keenan Thompson, Shaquille O'Neal, Leslie Jones, Kyle Mooney, Bobby Moynihan, etc., etc., etc. Yeah, here's I'll talk to there's many things to talk about.

My touchstone for Saturday night life has always been the compilations, so you see the best of... and so for the longest time, I'm like, 'This is the funniest show you've ever seen in your life,' right?
