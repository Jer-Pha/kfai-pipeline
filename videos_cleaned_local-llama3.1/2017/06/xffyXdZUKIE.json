Spider-Man - oh, I don't think we'll get a hard date. Yeah, I think we'll get a window, but we'll definitely see extended gameplay. We saw like a tiny little snippet when they announced it. I think we'll get something that's more than five minutes in length. Whoa! Wow, I think I'm with you up until the five minutes thing.

They can't come in at $500 as their base models too high, 400 is too low for them to make money on this for $49 feels right. Yeah, but they will have a premium version for more splendid.

I'm not sure in my head that's what was happening when they go home at night we come back that'd be cool. Well, I mean that I'm not saying that they're bringing new lots of new content but I think it makes sense for them to port this title - it's a hugely popular franchise for EA like why would you not bring this to console? You think Switch yes I do no way I'm really holding to that. I mean I think they'd love to, I just don't know.

We're not here to talk about the next installment of the Elder Scrolls. There have been rumors of an anniversary edition of Morrowind.
