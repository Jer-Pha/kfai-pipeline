And remember that they did do the Metroid thing, they did do the Kirby thing, that they did do the RPG stuff, that they did have Rocket League and they delivered on Mario Odyssey exactly as promised. And I think that's what everybody else is missing but says it was a great show. But they're two big announcements we knew about right? I knew well not new but everybody was assuming Evil Within and assuming Wolfenstein. Then take away from those games looking great, but where was the excitement there will get hype Gatorade moment of 2017. I mean honestly the Metroid thing is the most hype moment.
