I've been wearing this pink shirt since E3, like you know times so I know this is a fan favorite. I'm not going to let Nick get in my head and did you know Joey informed me that today is National Pink Day? I did not know that, I missed it, I would have worn a matching pink dress but I forgot okay yeah we don't coordinate that level in terms of how Kinda Funny Games Daily comes together there's not that much coordination yet in terms of outfits true uh thank you for coming back congratulations on one week done for Kinda Funny Games Daily this has been an incredibly exciting week uh the best friends have been super supportive and said wonderful nice things about you",

How's this working? I maxed out on my level like a long time ago. You can't prestige yet, yeah, I mean no not yet because technically the game is still in beta. Um, so I reached level 50 quite some time ago, which is the highest level you can go right now, and the other progression that they have in the game is each individual Hero has what's called a Master Challenge, and once you start the Master Challenge, you then level each individual hero from 1 to 10. Um, and getting a single hero to 10 requires quite a few matches, sure. Um, you get a set amount of XP based off your win, your loss, the you know how many kills and deaths and assists and all that stuff that you get Tower kills things like that. Uh, you can buy XP boosts with real-world money, since it is a free-to-play.\"",

There's always a con to each one, and then it is that if you have ones you don't want, you can sell them back. I think you buy them for 500 and sell them back for 250, and then you can turn it over.

I've never, I mean, I've rolled and got the same perk twice last time, okay?
