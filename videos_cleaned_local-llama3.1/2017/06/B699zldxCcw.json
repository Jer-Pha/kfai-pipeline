Switch Deluxe, Super Smash Bros. deluxe for switch so basically what they did with Mario Kart but for smash yeah it's good CH so that is one of my predictions that's the one that I wanted to bring this up I think that they're going to push the online to be free because I think smash will be uh the the more premium thing when they actually institute the paid online is this a prediction now or you just put about that so I do buy that they're going",

So the prediction I have down for Smash was it's going to mix the 3DS and Wii U stuff, so it'll be all the Smash Run stuff from the 3DS and all the stages that were 3DS exclusive and all the Wii U exclusive stages put those all together. Uh, there was a leaked image that came out a couple days ago, the validity of it is up for debate, um, but that would make a lot of sense. And then yeah, I think Ice Climbers return, I think they would announce that during this and then the get hyped moment would be uh Ribbon Girl or the Spring Man from ARMS or the Inklings, but I also can see them kind of uh holding off for when those games are released in the next month and two months after because Nintendo's all about taking Smash and using it to hype up the other games with their directs and stuff so like there'll be a direct for ARMS and it ends with an ARMS\"",

All right, my second Nintendo prediction... it's getting hard already, isn't it? Dang it! Which one am I going to go with? Um, they are going to make a splashy show of all of the fun colored Joy-Con controllers that you can buy from the Nintendo Switch. Will there be new colors? There will be new colors. There will be combos of colors. There will be all kinds of colors of Joy-Con controllers that are overpriced. Going to be excited, um... but yes, so I as a Switch owner wish that I could have waited to buy Joy-Con controllers. But if you want to play Mario Kart with four people, you had to buy Joy-Con controllers. Now every store I've ever walked into only had the gray Joy-Con controllers.

God, and this is definitely a Get Hype moment. Internet browsers coming to Switch, no, is that a get Hub? That's a get Hub, somebody who's in hotels a lot and can't connect their Switch to the internet. I'm pretty hyped about the ability to jump in and do it, and I think that's wise. I think that I would hope that now that there's a practical use case is out there like oh hey this is a mistake at the airport people can't **** download and buy our games, that's a that's trouble, that's not an E3 presentation thing for them no no you something they tacked on of like we're making changes I think that's just",

No, no, I can imagine 10 okay, okay, 10 new announcements of indie games. Yes, okay, all right. Well, you know, you kind of put a thorn in some of mine by reminding us that this presentation's going to be about stuff in 2017 because I have a couple here that are clearly not 2017 predictions. Um, but I do think that um we are going to see something about Animal Crossing on Switch. Yeah, I was one of mine too; I said teased Animal Crossing, teased was my prediction.

It's... it's one of those like I think it's one of those like uh hopes and dreams, yeah. But it's one of those that you predict every time, and it's got to happen eventually, right? I think I think the the Retro side of it is the more interesting part because they have to have something to announce at this point. It's been Tropical Freeze was years ago, so I don't know.

On the Fly, Nintendo is going to announce some dumb partnership with some random business. It'll be like you can go to Pizza Hut or Subway and use their Wi-Fi to try new games or some weird ass thing like that. Some stupid ass partnership: you go to Macy's and you get a game good or whatever; you can get a new avatar for your thing, okay? I mean nobody's mentioned the Rabbids yet, right?
