We did all the press conference coverage. Then E3 day one happened. We weren't here because we were traveling. We because we were seeing the Nintendo stuff. Then we traveled on down here. Yeah. So, this is technically day two of E3, but it's our first day playing games, doing demos, doing all that stuff. We're going to be talking about what we played today or what we saw today behind closed doors. Sure. Sure. Sure. There's more detailed uh in-depth stuff over on youtube.com/kindafunny where we do all our reactions. We had our GameSpot live show where we had a whole bunch of devs come through and talk to them about their games. So, you can check that out as well. But, let's start off. Greg, what did you play?

You saw a let's play is essentially what happened. Well, sure. Okay. Sure. Did you like, comment, and subscribe is a more important question. Oh, in that same place where I saw the let's play of Super Mario Odyssey, I saw Reggie play ARMS and I saw Kimishima. Oh, so it was quite the moment.

Uh, this was the hostage demo that we saw last year, I believe, at E3, right? That's where it was. Well, I it gets so confusing with the PSX stuff getting mixed in sometimes. Like I can never keep track of what I saw. Sure. Uh it's my first time playing Detroit: Become Human. I had seen the demo of everybody else last year.

I was exploring the thing. They pulled the you know mom back past me grieving and she started screaming about like they're sending an android in and I came back and just walked towards the elevator and had her screaming in my face. I was like that's cool. And then you know walked up there and then started piecing it together and you know it's it's been so long since I did the whole like quarter turn circles on a stick for these like you know Quantic Dream games.

Exactly. I mean, and that's the thing, you know, they revealed that third playable character uh at E3 this year. Uh this was, you know, the second one had ever been revealed, the android that was his hostage negotiator or whatever. Um, it was cool to get into that role and have it be, it was a detective, right?

He you know he's kind of your dude like leading you through this through this uh attack in um uh Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, I don't know the somewhere in Germany essentially. Sure. Um and so there's a really cool part where you are engaging in combat. You're you're shooting Nazis on the other side. Um, and there was a part where one of your dudes is in the street like, \"Oh my my leg, my leg.\" You know, and so player runs up to him and grabs him and drags him off into cover, which was really cool. Like some straight up like saving Private Ryan that, you know, um you're used to just those guys being NPCs and you can't do anything to them, but you're actually able to recover them and save",

So it kind of reminded me a lot of Uncharted 4 when you are in the clock tower um in the bell tower whatever and so you're up top very very saving power Ryan style sniping down covering your dudes and a tank eventually sees you and shoots at you and the guy in front of you gets like from his nipples up are just gone and he falls back and he falls back like towards you and all you see is just like ribs like broken ribs and like it's just all gone.

And then from there on uh really intense scene of the building started falling down and the bells were falling and you're like trying to escape and uh really well done. Um, again, didn't get to play it, um, unfortunately because I wanted to play Destiny. And the Destiny 2 demo was essentially the same one that they showed us, um, during the Destiny reveal. Okay. Uh, couple weeks ago or a month back or whatever. Um, it's the same thing that you do there, but I was playing it on an old PC. Oh, you played the PC? Was you know that WDI? You know what that means? Yeah. Yeah. So, it was cool to see that game in faster than 30 frames per second. Yeah. Didn't blow you away. Um, did it make you say \"I got to play\"",

I played a few matches in Overwatch a couple weeks ago, but that took some getting used to, like cuz all the buttons are mapped differently or whatever. Um, but uh I broke the game because I'm candy Andy because I'm such a uh because I'm such a seasoned game developer in throughout my career, guys. Mhm. Uh got to a part where I jumped off this area too many times and died. And it shot me back to a prior area with a door that wouldn't open. And so the guy was like, \"Oh, well PC gaming.\" Yeah, it is. So they No, it's not PC gaming. It's just a bug. So the never happened to any of the consoles. I mean, I was at the E3 event and that never happened. The door is open.

Maybe we can hire you as a QA tester.\" I was like, \"Fuck, I came from game development. that.\" Like, \"No thanks.\" Um, but the guns were super fun. Um, you start off with like all these super high quality weapons, all the purple rare weapons. Um, and so you got to go into your menu and choose which weapons you prefer, like your your plasma or your your burst rifle or like a hand cannon. So I went for my hand cannon. The hand cannon. That's where it's at. Just a giant ass magnum. Um, I mean it's it's more Destiny, you know? It's fun. Are you still excited to play with me? Yeah, absolutely. Okay, cool. Absolutely. Yeah. Um, yeah.

So, speaking of Mario, I got to play it. It's awesome.

I definitely think that uh Mario Sunshine had a a really really really tight feeling Mario where every single thing you wanted him to do he did, right? Um I feel like Galaxy dumbed things down a bit uh when it came to his move set. And I it was weird to go back to him having a whole bunch of things and especially new stuff being able to throw the Poltergust 3000 and not only use it to attack enemies. Um which cuz that's very similar to just like the hammer mechanic that we had in Mario 64. But in Mario 64 I never felt like that was the right thing to do. Like there was never an enemy that I'm like I'm going to punch that thing cuz you're getting way too close and that could hurt you. Whereas with the Poltergust being able to throw it to you guys.",

But the added ability to throw it out, hold the button, and then use it as a platform to jump, like immediately I'm like, \"This is going to be awesome in the later levels or when there's real platform-intensive sections of the game.\" Uh, I didn't get to play too much. I wish I could play more, but uh the let's play up of what I did was hard for me to wrap my head around the idea of climbing and what platforms I could go on and what I couldn't go on because the last couple 3D Mario games have been way more platform-focused and just momentum of moving forward whereas this is an open-world.

And it's that's early to say, but it reminded me of how I felt about Breath of the Wild last year when I played it at E3 where I was like, \"This is really awesome. It's a little overwhelming, and I'm I'm I want a lot more time with it. I'm blown away by Mario, but I feel like it didn't totally click for me yet.\" Wow. See, I I think I thought Mario was a slam dunk in terms of like I was with you last year when we played Zelda. It was like that was a weird thing to get dropped in the middle of and not understand what is, you know, blah blah. But for this one, like when you're running and you see the moon piece or you see somebody over there, the jump rope game, you're like, I know I can",

When today on the GameSpot show when uh they were doing it and she bought like the pinstripe suit, I'm like, yes, I'm going to buy I can't wait to buy every outfit in this game. I mean, even me when I was playing, I needed that sombrero course and I got it. I made that thing happen. But what I'm saying, I want this clear. Odyssey is it's amazing and I I really think that it's going to follow uh Breath of the Wild to me in terms of at E3.

Um but I I really think that it's going to revolutionize what a 3D Mario game can be. Um I like how little they're showing us. They only had two levels here. And even those two levels, it's one of those things where it reminds me of Breath of the Wild last year 2017 where every time I see it walking by on a screen, it's a different section of the level. They're doing something different. I'm like, \"What is where's that?\" And it's like, \"Oh, you went down a manhole which gives you a Mario Sunshine style obstacle course uh in those like the levels where you didn't where you didn't have the um water pack, the flood.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, that's awesome.\" And then another time I see I'm like, \"All right, cool.

It feels like a step forward um and a a big step for Mario, which I'm so impressed by because I didn't think they could do something after Galaxy that made me go, \"Wow.\" Like, there is still new Mario Magic out there, but they did. So, I'm very excited. That Mario Magic. Yeah. Yeah. Uh Everybody's Golf is awesome. It's it's it's Hot Shots Golf on the PlayStation 4 with Shu Yoshida as a playable character and that was awesome.

Uh, and so to sit down with that and be like, I can just see the hours of I'm going to sink into that game, especially when it's like we can do tournaments with the audience and we can do all these different things.

Interesting. Interesting. Seeing you play it totally changed my mind. I was just like, oh, cool. Like, when it wasn't just a trailer where it was like shot, shot shot. Seeing you actually like go through it, I'm like, oh, that looks like it's fun to play. It looks like a better Mighty No. 9. Exactly. That's a great point. What I was struggling with is that I didn't have the speed down. I didn't have that cadence down.

So, we saw Spider-Man and Days Gone and Uncharted. There's uh reaction videos you can watch of us going into all those, but we didn't play them. The one thing I did get to play was Knack 2. And let me tell you guys, the hype is real. Oh my gosh. Oh, Lord. And S. Now, here's Mark Cernovich delivering. All jokes aside, um I just saw it and no one was playing it and I'm like, \"All right, well, I got to give this thing a shot.\" And then uh one of the developers was there and he's like, \"Oh, cool.

I played enough of it to know I didn't like it. I didn't like how it felt and everything about it just it it wasn't what I what I wanted from from the platform, and I'm a 3D platform guy. Like, it felt way too kitty, and it didn't feel right.\" It's like going back to what I was talking about with Mario. Mario just feels right. Knack did not. Instantly with this, I'm like, it feels a lot better and his move set is way more interesting and it's straight up ripping off um Crash Bandicoot. Like it's the triple jump with the spin. Yeah.

I'm like, can you demonstrate those moves for us? Cuz you did the dance today. I did the dance. That was awesome. It wasn't my birthday, but Crash Bandicoot sang me happy birthday. That was cool. Very weird. check that out on our channel as well. It's a weird show. Um, but with that, I was pleasantly surprised where I was like, \"Huh, this doesn't suck.\" Yeah. So, that was surprise number one. Then, as I played through the level a bit more with the guy, I was like, \"There's a lot of hidden secrets here.\" Like, it sounds like a fun game to play through. And he was saying it's a 10 to 12 hour experience, but $40. That was the thing that I'm like, that's cool. I get who this game is for, and they're actually doing a good job with it.

Like it was simple to understand when you were supposed to be what, but there was a lot of hidden things. And what I liked is there's difficulty levels that you can choose. And if you're a little kid that isn't that good, you can just play easy and it actually will block off some of the more difficult sections of the game so you can just get through it. But then on the harder section, like if you go on hard, the platforming is even more complicated. So it choosing level, oh, when enemies hit you, it takes more life away. It's actually like it's going to change the level layout to accordingly. And I think that's that's pretty cool. All right. I forgot the other game I played today. Cool. Greg, do you mind? Thank you.

Played uh Gang Beasts on the PlayStation 4. Christ. Where I officially won the Kinda Funny World Championship. You actually didn't. I did actually. We said that it would be who first person to win two. No, not what we said. We said first person to win two - I mean it was a match of we had three lives and whoever lost all three lives, whoever was the last remaining one. We didn't get to complete that mid-match. You decided since you had already won one match that if we ran out of time, it's like thank you. I can't be held responsible for the fact that GameSpot hired us to do stuff. Our segment was ending.

Did you feel like Gang Beast was moving smoother and faster on PlayStation 4? No, I didn't. Really? No, not at all. We've been playing a lot of Gang Beast on Xbox One or no, actually on PC. We've been playing on PC. I thought we played today on controllers. Well, we're playing the PlayStation 4 build off of a computer today. Oh, okay. Okay. Good lord, this game, man. This game is so ridiculous. I love Gang Beasts. I think it's such a good time. I never quite feel like I'm in control of what I'm doing. Sure. But it seems like when I win, I feel like I earned it.

Something about it was different for sure. Yeah. Those frames per second, great. But it worked out. I got my championship. I would I will get the platinum trophy one day. Yeah. It's heavy. It is heavy. The championship both. Don't worry, Andy. One day you'll have this. Tim never will, but you will one day. Couple matches of Mario Kart. We'll see what happens.

Um, I realized that I'm so impressed by the Spider-Man demo that we saw and the gameplay that we saw dude actually playing the game - he's actually playing the game, and it looks like the footage we saw last year at E3. 'Cause when we first saw that, it's like there's no way that's gameplay. That's gameplay. The way Spider-Man moves and the parkour that he does - like that is built in. That is how it looks when he moves around buildings or jumps over desks or whatever. And I'm like, \"That is so damn just some pre-cut scene or whatever.\" That's really Spider-Man's awesome.

Yeah, because I immediately wrote it off last year as oh it's a Last of Us Wannabe. And that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be a bad game. It can be a great game.
