I do not believe this game is any more real now than I did an hour ago, and that's upsetting to me. But the last time we saw a CG trailer of Beyond Good & Evil 2 was in 2008 at the Ubisoft conference - that's insane, that is such a long time ago. And the B.O.N.G.A. won amazing game, never played it, it's great, it's fantastic. But this is at this point it's going to be it's a totally different game right, like this is this is something new. I like that they're going for a prequel cuz that's kind of a great jump on point for people that haven't played the original one. But the problem is Greg's absolutely right, they can't come out show another CG trailer despite how cool that looked - cuz it looked really cool, love the world, I like I'm getting",

M yeah and it sucks, I feel like that's kind of Ubisoft's conference in a nutshell and that's how it's been the last couple years where I look down this list, I'm like these are some great announcements there's a lot of really great games in there but when you present it in such a lazy old school way it's just not exciting and it's not fun and I I definitely think that there's a problem with their with how they deliver.

Yeah, looking through this though, like there's nothing that I super super stoked for besides South Park. Um, that's coming this year.
