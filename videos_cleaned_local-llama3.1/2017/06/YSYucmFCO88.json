Dontnod did not lie about this; I have their whole blog post here. Deck Nine games are the guys and gals who are making this one happen, the prequel to Life is Strange, and talking you know here about uh Rachel Amber and Chloe coming together now here's what I'll tell you about this: a lot of details from the announcement today didn't expect that; a lot release date really quick August 31st, one of three episodes. Didn't expect that either; I feel like we have a lot more concrete information than I expected to have when it got leaked that it was going to be coming up right uh what's interesting first off exciting is happening at all right so August 31st Xbox One PlayStation 4 PC on Steam great we love that a lot uh three episodes okay makes you feel like it's not a full-on Life is Strange game of course that was five before but whatever I'm getting more Life is Strange probably",

Uh, three episodes okay makes you feel like it's not a full-on Life Is Strange game of course that was Five Before, but whatever I'm getting more Life Is Strange probably a good idea though right for for prequel it's like all right let's cut the fat sure. But what's interesting is when we started talking about this in the morning show we're like okay cool there's been this leak they're going to do this prequel what does it mean and I was like I don't know how do you deal with rewinding time I thought we'd play as Rachel and it would turn out that Rachel had the ability and at the end of the game we had to give up ourselves to save Chloe, like we knew the choice we were about to make would kill us but that wouldn't be what it was in instead they came out and just said straight up there is no rewind power it's you're playing as Chloe cuz unlike Max, Chloe has no rewind power so we recommend you think before you speak, Chloe sharp tongue will require her to live with.",

Chloe's sharp tongue will require her to live with whatever she says as before every single action and choice will have direct consequences in the short mid and long term. Awesome I didn't expect them to confirm who we'd be playing as maybe there is still a Rachel segment in there, who knows. Also interesting though is the fact that they call out here that so it's this one three episodes here right to make up before the storm however if you get the deluxe edition of Life Is Strange you get a self-contained episode called Farewell. This is your final chance to play as Max and it says it's \"takes place long before the events of Before the Storm\" so it's Farewell which to me, and I'm going to spoil Life Is Strange for you everybody would be that we are then I would assume and it's long before the events of this prequel which are said",

In here you see the guy who lives at the RV Frank; he sucks, but maybe his dog sucks still. But maybe we'll appreciate them more too. Maybe you happen yeah little back uh I'm super stoked I'm super excited I'm I'm happy it's so quick I oh the one thing that was the most interesting I thought though is this in the release they put up right Ashley Burch, Chloe's original voice actor, is helping write the the thing but you're not she's not doing the voice this time around for 16-year-old Chloe they're using Rihanna as which I feel is a weird choice you know what I mean. I mean how much earlier is this in the story they're still going to Black Whale it's not I don't think it's that much of a change you know what I mean I forget exactly what she was but it's not like it's been a decade or",
