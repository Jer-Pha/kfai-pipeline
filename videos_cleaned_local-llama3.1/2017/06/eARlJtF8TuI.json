Vicki, you just... oh my God! Other than Bomberman, a game which we are well aware of its heritage and how loved it is, and Castlevania is. Jones said so much so that Castlevania is getting its own show on Netflix, and because of that, we're hearing a lot of desires from our fans for a new Castlevania series. Scroll down K. So we do know there is a demand for a new game, but right now nothing is set in stone as the discussions are still ongoing. As for whether or not Super Bomberman R will make it to the Wii U, according to Jones, the answer is no. Good of course, the short answer is no. Who the... will bring anything?

Yeah, why would anybody bring the Wii U's dead? Stop making Wii U games, stop making 3DS games. Am I right? Yeah, you're too right. Now something to take into consideration is Super Bomberman R on the Nintendo Switch is by far the best-selling Bomberman in at least the last 20 years. Which I know isn't that crazy impressive because 20 years is a long time and that would bring us back to you know the DS times and a little further than that, long times.
