Although, why did you think it wasn't happening? Like, were you concerned that like oh they're finally done with that Pok\u00e9mon? It was I don't think it was the concern that it wasn't happening; it was the belief because they lied of just nothing like that would happen at this office. Well, tell me about a lie. This is something that pisses me off when I see in press conferences.

I, yeah, I remember when it first came out, and it was like, \"You know what, this launch doesn't seem good.\" Next E3, we're going to get our Metroid games; they're going to announce a Pok\u00e9mon console game; we're going to get the next Mario, like the next big thing. No, we didn't get that. So now that the Switch has come out, we've gotten great launch games, launch game, um, you know, there's a couple other things happening. We know we're getting the next big Mario, and it's awesome.

On stage, I'm totally you try to just sneak that in there and I'm not buying it, no I don't, no no no, Metroid Prime, yeah yeah, no the return to Sam that's awesome, I agree. Honestly I think it was the more exciting announcement, not that like that game's gonna be better than Prime but like we saw it they played a lot of it and it looks ugly, it's on DS, it's dead to me, I don't need it. I hear you, I'm I'm won't be playing it but I am excited for Metroid fans now here's the thing taking my fanboyism back a bit I understand yeah a fanboy of Nintendo I understand that uh a lot of the announcements made of the Nintendo thing that I'm really excited about are things that are years away and",

But on top of that we get Mario, we get Fire Emblem Warriors coming up, we get all this stuff and I feel like they did a really good job of kind of letting us know what the rest of the year looks like and giving us a glimpse into the future and I think that was a really important question that I had as a fan that they answered. Yeah, now getting off of Nintendo for a second, I feel like a lot of the other conferences - I don't think there was a bad conference this year, I think they were all at least good.

But with the press conference, I feel like they're coming out and they're going to announce games, announce games, announce games - when they focus for way too long on one, you're alienating so many people. And I feel like EA still doesn't quite get that. Uh, when they come out because I understand that Madden needs to be there and that NBA Live needs to be there, and all, and FIFA obviously. But why does that take up 45 minutes? Sure could take up 10. What's the impact? It's really hard for me to gauge.
