It's okay, it's okay. But anyway, very excited for this game Ori and the Will of the Wisps is one of my favorite um Xbox One games so far moving forward we got this game which is which is interesting it's called The Artful Escape right didn't get to see much of it this trailer is more proof of concept of art style than anything and I love it already that's a great art style I love this idea of when he busts out the guitar and he's in his little space suit sure okay I want to know more about this game what is this game it's a game that has my interest peaked as they say I enjoy that it ended saying when it's damn ready, the release welcome to Indie Games in 2017 uh but I did a little digging",

The hope would be that again that they came out and they're like here are the levels we made for you guys and every all the bad ones were like we don't like them, they went away maybe they came back and they actually made good levels, you know what I mean? Doubt it. Okay, I doubt it but we'll see. Still very excited for Cuphead. Okay, um, and then here you go Tacoma got the release date August 2nd.
