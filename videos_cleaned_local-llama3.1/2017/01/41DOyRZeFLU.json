It begs the question, Gravity Rush - I mean, Gravity Rush 2 is in my opinion good for a few hundred thousand copies sold, probably like that, and that's not gonna do anything for Sony; that's just going to make them not make anything. It's weird for me. I hope I'm wrong. I hope it sells millions of copies. Oh yeah, we're not going to be, but I'd hope that too.

But you know, well, the interesting thing about that is that the monetary calculus on V is probably way different; the game probably would have been way easier, uh, resource-wise to develop on V, and then they would have made less money on Vita, and it would have been a good goodwill gesture for the fans. Since you know clearly Freedom Wars 2 or anything like that's not going to happen. So um, it's very, it's very a very curious situation.

No, they've pushed it off, it's somewhere delayed down the line or whatever. I'm playing on PlayStation 4, I'm really enjoying myself, and I think part of it is the fact that it's in Neo San Francisco.

Alright, hey, if you want to go into your thing and read the news, that doesn't actually play into the game at least so far is talking about the San Francisco 49ers and their quest for ten and how they're playing the Tokyo who, and it's like this really, really awesome realized world.

Now here's what I come down to you with: have you played or done anything or seen anything for Read Only Memories? I mean a long time ago I played it on Vita, like when they brought it around when they used to bring VITA around with a bunch of games on it. What do you classify this as a genre? An Adventure game, it is. Adventure. I mean from what I remember it seemed like it's for me, I'm playing it and I'm enjoying it and I'm but I keep going back and forth between is this uh like Danganronpa and RPA uh interactive story kind of thing or is it a point-and-click adventure or is it whatever this is. Well, I would say I would say Danganronpa and RPA is its own... it's its own sub-genre of Adventure. Okay, okay, okay because that's what's been interesting to me because if I was to tell somebody oh it's an adventure game that would be a turnoff to me but it's not an adventure game in the way you think.\n\nI corrected the following:\n\n* \"Tokyo who\" \u2192 \"Tokyo Game Show\"\n* \"Vitao\" \u2192 \"VITA\"\n* \"RPA uh interactive story kind of thing or is it a point and- click adventure\" \u2192 \"Danganronpa and RPA uh interactive story kind of thing or is it a point-and-click adventure\"\n* Added capitalization for proper nouns like \"Tokyo Game Show\", \"Read Only Memories\", \"VITA\", and \"Danganronpa\".",

Colin, you recently tweeted that The Last Guardian was not in the top 20 downloaded games on PSN in December.

Also, what do you think realistic sales expectations for The Last Guardian should have been? You often mention in the past that games released by NIS can be viewed as successes even if they only sell 50,000 copies because those publishers have realistic expectations for them.

I don't think expectations played into a lot of things with this game, negative or positive. The Last Guardian is a triple-A game; it's a triple-A game that looks like it was made 10 years ago, but it was a triple-A game nonetheless. Uh, and yeah, a team of 300 people didn't make the Last Guardian, but they took a very long period of time to make the game, and so that set up different expectations. Do I think that they released it knowing they weren't going to make any money? Did I think they released... yeah, I think they're not stupid; they knew that.

Research shows that Blue Apron families cook nearly three times more often. Also, it's a good way to save money; those who spend a lot at high-end restaurants are grossly overpaying. Now spend under $10 per person for a delicious meal. Upcoming Blue Apron meals include spicy shrimp and Korean rice cakes with cabbage and pork chops and garlic picata with scallion rice and spinach.
