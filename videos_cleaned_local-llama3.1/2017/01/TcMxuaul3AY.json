He was just like \"Yo, we're going to be here real quick, I want to wrap up things, we announced, I want to tell you some new stuff, I want to get you guys playing the games CU, I want to get hands on ASAP\" and it was just such a different uh take cuz I'm like where was this like why didn't you just directly tell people the information boom boom boom boom boom bam cuz all of a sudden it sounds more impressive when you do that uh but I was most excited when they let us go play whatever games we want, I walk in I was like there's a fair amount of games here playable uh I thought it was going to",

I didn't have time to play it, but it looks like an indie V game. Uh, it's coming to PS4, Xbox One, and Switch at the same time sometime later this year. Dis Sky of 5 - not my type of game. Didn't play it. Just Dance 2017 - it's the same setup we've seen for six years where there's like six girls just standing there, come on dance with me, and it's like no one's doing the choreo. Kev's like I'll see you guys later walked in 40 minutes later came sweating but it's always but then they always get the one guy to go play and it's just like one random ass game style is play with like these six super hot girls, they're all dads",

He doesn't want to be there for the people that are playing having fun. Good for you, but oh man, you just got roped into it. No, no one's happy about that. The Siren Song; oh so bad, and Skylanders Imaginators. I didn't need to play Skylanders already out, yeah, I was just there, whatever. Um, I did not, so I didn't play it, but I did use Skylanders as an excuse to be able to hold the controller more nice. You know? You walk by, you're like, \"What what demo has nobody?\" Oh, Skylanders, yeah, great. I'm a big fan; I got the Crash uh Amiibo to thanks all right, but no, you didn't even start it, sir.

I don't know does have a proper name or is that just the Nintendo Switch like when configuration, cuz I keep calling it Gamepad but it's not Gamepad but whatever. So I did that to be able to for um anyway, so those are games I did not play; games I did play Arms super super good compared to super good to where yeah it it's not going to be great it's not going to be a system seller it's not going to be a game that you know people are playing for years on end but I do think that it has a Splatoon like quality to.",

Like I really believe that these are characters that could last for a while and it's cool that they're making new IP with new Nintendo characters. Uh, because you know everybody gets so upset at them relying on the same cast over and over and over. At least at least they're trying. Uh, Zelda obviously it's fantastic I can't believe they're going to play in less than 6 weeks be able to just get lost in that world and it's a damn big world. So much so that playing it on the the handheld mode I'm like I don't know if I need this handheld it's freaking crazy like the graphics, 720 on the screen no one should be complaining about this things look great on on the screen there's no game I saw playing that I'm like I wish the resolution was",

Reading is fine, but it's like having Link and just seeing the world - it's just like it's a little overbearing. Um, I definitely preferred playing it on the TV. Um, I got to play Zelda in most configurations out of any other game where I played in handheld mode; I got to play with the Joy-Con controller on the thing, and um, I played with the two Joy-Cons on the screen, and all the control options felt great - none of them felt any noticeably better or worse than the others for Zelda. Um, this game it really does look special; it looks like it's going to be remembered very much like a return to Zelda form, yeah. Um, having said that though, it is Zelda through and through.

I'm like all right cool, that's good that they're taking a more adult uh design interface so excited about that. And a thing that I'm I'm super impressed by is the speed at which it docks and undocks, which sounds like a stupid thing but it blew my mind at how responsive uh and snappy the Switch was. And it does lead to the name Switch, and like I think that a lot of why they called it that is because of how ridiculously crazy it is switching from TV to portable mode is when we saw in the Jimmy Fallon thing, everyone thought that was like a fake ass video playing and like there's no way it'll switch that fast.
