Uh, Zelda's going to be awesome. Bomberman sounds awesome from everything you're saying, but right there that's what I plan on picking up and playing on day one is Snipperclips isn't even a launch game no great, great it's it's March okay so so that's the thing moving moving on a little bit here games confirmed from March that don't have an actual date tied to them are Snipperclips Fast RMX I Am Setsuna and Has-Been Heroes. Gotcha! I feel like Snipperclips should have made the launch date, I think it would have been, I feel like from what you're saying that would sound like of course it should have yes like you have this eShop game you have this thing that people think is cool but you want to get it out there on launch day so everybody who's like I want to play something and I'm hearing good things about this and it's only $14.",

Um, the first year of the Switch here sounds like it's going to be a stumble out of the gates and it's going to be an uphill battle based on popular opinion and everything else that's happened with it right. Like I went back and forth, I was pre-ordering it on the first night there off of Amazon and it was one of those like I'm getting it and I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it and what what I figure out why I'd want to keep this and what it means to me and for me.

They this thing is not ready, that I think that that's like my major takeaway. They don't they don't even know the answers to half the questions that are being asked where Netflix is even on it which is weird, you can only take screenshots with it, you can't like there's no trophy system, there's you have to use online, you know a lot of it's attached to a phone app. Like I'm like what like the the common theme I I've gotten from people from the Switch is that some people are excited about it, some people are in the middle, some people are not excited about it but a common theme is that if anything that conference made people less excited and that's that's a that's bad like if I never I would have been like yeah day one day one day one like still if I didn't see that conference you know and that's",

And again, do I sound like a blind lover? Yeah exactly but those moments, those awesome moments of love that I get, I'm like all right cool that's enough for me especially because it's cheap enough overall as an investment where I'm like $300 like all right cool $300 like with the Wii U I've I have not regretted the Wii U a single moment because of the five at least five games that I love with it let alone the fact that there was 15 that I love with it but when I talk about perception, it's not necessarily talking from my lens because",

It's just it just makes it more expensive and there and therefore harder so there is a disparity there that I think is relevant and important but it is not that important uh Wii was significantly weaker than PS3 and there were still games between those two consoles so because they sold there yeah so I I just I want Nintendo to succeed and the only thing that's changed in me is that I just don't believe anything they say anymore now they're like this is Gonna be great, I'm like I don't believe you now I don't believe a **** word you say and you'll show me now because I",

We'll get video streaming going on there and video capture on there. We'll get a trophy system in there. We'll do all these kinds of things. Give themselves time; they should have done that. I really do feel like this thing is being rushed to market, and I do not understand why. And I think they're hurting the console because if power isn't part of the equation, which it shouldn't be, another six months shouldn't hurt it; it should only help it, and it should allow them to engender more support as well. And I think that you know we'll see how it lives or dies. Uh, but I think that if they can get\u2014I think P was saying between six and 8 million in its first year.

But Greg, it's I don't know, I I don't I I'm scared for them, and I'll be interested to see how this kind of rolls and adops. I disagree in the sense that I'm happy it's coming out so soon, like so ridiculously soon; the fact that this thing's weeks away blows my mind because I I think that we just need to power through the launch period and just hopefully get to what this system is really going to be, and I wish that wasn't the case. I wish that right at the gate it had all these things and it was what we all dreamed it was going to be; it's not though, so I'm like all right, I need to do exactly what I did with the 3DS and just kind of hope they have a relaunch period",
