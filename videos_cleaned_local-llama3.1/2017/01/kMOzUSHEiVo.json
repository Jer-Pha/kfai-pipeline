Uh, so if you play him in other games, he's sort of the same; he's got struggles with the dark D, you know, all that stuff. And then Violent Ken is um, sort of like the gist of his story is he gets captured by M. Bison and he kind of gets that cybernetic power okay? So but from a gameplay perspective, how different are they from the other K's? Violent Ken has an extra move that he does so he does give up some of his speed and he gains more power okay cool. He does have an EXT like sort of dash move I'll show you that going to G stage. The music makes everything better and uh, so the buttons real quick: punch is going to be Y and X also the Hard Punch is going to be the L Button. You can tell he's Violent Ken cuz he's purple. Wow, got a round that's all I needed to feel valid have a clear strategy jump around and jump on your head.",
