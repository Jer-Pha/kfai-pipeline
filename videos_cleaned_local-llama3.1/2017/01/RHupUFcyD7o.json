Like I said, Ask Kinda Funny Anything - we're gonna jump into the thing here. I believe it said we have 38 comments here on the first ever edition of Ask Kinda Funny Anything. I have not read ahead; I do not know what any of you asked me so these will be live off the cuff answers. Just ate some fried chicken before this, it was good. First question comes from Jose Gomez - Jose Gomez says: \"Other than setting up Kinda Funny and anything IG and related, what's your biggest accomplishment in life? Something that you can always look back and say at least I did.\"",

I don't know, man, that's a tough one. Because if I can't use Kinda Funny and I can't use IGN, you start immediately limiting what the... I've done. Cuz if I mean, I built Kinda Funny, that's awesome, um, and I built it with people. I'm not saying I built it, uh, you know, I did Beyond over at IGN, but I'm thinking even like, oh man, I met Chris Jericho, well, I did that through IGN, that doesn't count so what's my biggest accomplishment in life outside of Kinda Funny and IGN? Back in college, I got all the dog tags in Metal Gear Solid 2. Love Metal Gear Solid two on the PS2, that would be... I mean, that I platinumed that game without it having a platinum, so I guess that would be pretty up there. Portillo, you know what I mean?

So they're super loud, so they were able to make it seem like they were bigger than they were. And then the other guy was like a bar fly that came in all the time; people loved him. And this guy was dressed as Shrek - if I'm lying, I'm dying. This guy was Shrek; he was huge, he was giant, he was very big, and he was painted green. He had the things on; he did not seem like a friendly character. And so like uh, he I think he was a little pissed off that it came down to they were like all right you guys have tied but only one of you can win. He I think he took that kind of rough.

Uh, then you leave all your comments there, and then at some point in the month, like right now for me, you come through, you answer all those things, then we put it up the final Saturday of the month, and then the process begins again. Remember, it's for the $15 and above level; we thank you for your support there. If you think $15 is pretty steep, you get a question read. Remember, of course, that includes the bonus episode of the podcast early, it includes every episode of the podcast early as an MP3, includes every episode of the podcast early as a video. Uh, then for the Raffles we and giveaways for our games each day on Twitch. There's a million things; it's not just $15 bucks for the question; it's $15 bucks to support us and get a whole bunch of other cool stuff too, so I hope you enjoyed it.\"",
