First off, overall amazing experience. The place is great; I'll go back, but it was that jarring thing of what my expectations were because it is San Francisco and Bay Area, and I - we do go to really great places usually that are super awesome, you know what I mean? And we got there, and like, there was a line to get in, but it was like 11:00, and our reservation started at 10:30. You book it for like three hours right? So we got there, and I'm like, 'Well, they're lined up for the bar; there's already people over at the picnic table. What do we do?' So like, we walked in, and then like the person at the bar was like, 'Oh, we're not open just yet.' I'm like, 'We have a reservation,' and she's like, 'Oh, go still go back.'\"",

I'm like, \"Give them nothing; don't tip them for this.\" I don't have that; I can't do that. I know it was a whole like conversation. Like, I will tear this up and I'll pay for the meal to give them no money because again, it was just like five different people came, no communication between them. Long periods of time, we ordered a salad and um, the pork belly fried rice. They do that; that should take two seconds to cook in a plate, and we were there like 30 minutes. We finished our drinks; they came by like, \"Do you want another drink?\" I'm like, \"No, I'd like the food.\" If I got if you know if this would have all moved in you know a smooth fashion maybe I would have liked that, but now I'm angry and I don't want to do this.
