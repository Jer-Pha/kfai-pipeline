I've talked about Blue Apron quite a bit, ladies and gentlemen, because you know #CookingWithGreggy. I cook all the time, and Blue Apron was a gift my mother gave me last year. I'm pretty sure she did not use the code; I'm not sure if we had the deal. But basically, Blue Apron sends you all the fresh ingredients you need to make awesome meals. And you might say, Greg, \"I have no talent at cooking like you do.\" And I will tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, I once had no talent of cooking either before I became the male Rachael Ray. Basically, all you need to do is these are 30-minute meals for the most part; they send you the instructions, you go through step by step with the pre-portioned ingredients, and you make whatever you want. Do you want to know us in the upcoming meals? Hell yeah, you do! Seared pork chops with far-out farro and cranberry chutney \u2013 I don't know if that is but it sounds good; spaghetti squash",

I won't talk about musicals, I'm very excited for La La Land. I think it represents a pretty unique thing that I don't think we've seen in a very long time, which is A) it's a wholly original musical B) it's not something that's necessarily in vogue right now in the time of Star Wars movies and comic book movies. But everyone seems pretty hyped about that, and there's a certain... and I think it's because this is just a certain magic to the trailer, in a match to the cast, and a magic of Damien Chazelle - so one decayed like hear from you guys what your thoughts were on it and use of musicals in general right now. Keeping in mind of course that they're still doing all these live event musicals, they just did Hairspray which was I think did the worst of all of them up to date, and then you know obviously Disney still",

Yeah, well I'm excited for La La Land, that trailer is awesome, it's what we've talked a lot in the last topic of like I love Emma Stone and I love Ryan Gosling so sure you're in this movie that looks fun and that's the big thing what you're talking about you know it's not a popular thing in Star Wars and comic books and all these things but it's standing out because it's different because it looks so different, that trailer feels so different, feels so fun, pops yeah exactly like there's just there's a magic to it, it's that one it's the one moment the trailer where she goes I",

It's beautifully made, all the technicality but like the technical nature the movie was gorgeous but it was just it was a little weird for me, I don't know and part of it may have done had to do with the fact that it's so very much culturally placed in the Hawaiian culture that I think that maybe some part of it was like I had a little hard time relating to it. I've never been to Hawaii, I don't really I'm not familiar with that that much, I'm not familiar with the legend of Maui who was the character that brought the rock plays and so I just watching it I'm like I there's nothing for me really to grasp here as a 36 year old white adult male watching this with his friends but it was fun and is definitely worth a watch it's just it's if not",

It was...it's really my first time watching a movie that was completely set in that world, and it was cool, but I don't know, there's just something about it. They didn't grab me; it wasn't...it wasn't a hundred percent for me on how those things like depth settings can really make or break stuff for you, like Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon. Like I was so not interested in it because it was that whole Hawaiian thing. I'm just saying, yeah, I don't really like that playing it; I'm like I dealt with it, and I was cool with it, but it's like...I don't really like Hawaii. I love Hawaii; I love being there, but I don't like it as a place to catch fake monsters. Yes, gotcha, no, no, because really me, dammit. Sorry, sorry about that. How do you feel about musicals?

I actually, it was a weird one, me and my friend did those lights and sound for a production of that in high school and so yeah and I, it was like my only exposure to that ever. I did the lights or at the show is fun and it was for this thing called Gateway which is like a pretty big Long Island traveling playhouse where people like groups come from Broadway from other places and stay at this basically a state on Long Island and then put on shows for holidays and then they leave so people really like that and they had like a youth thing that like kind of fills the space between when big names come every few weeks and so we got involved",

I was like, \"Let's do God, let's do more musicals.\" In Chicago is huge, and Cabaret was big. To write for Cabaret, they did Cabaret, I think they deviated from Chicago, that was the Richard Gere, Renee Zellweger one. Yeah, I think Cabaret was also redone if I'm not mistaken anyway.
