So I hope that makes all uh sense for you guys um, and let's get right into it. Uh, Patrick Canon or Kanan asks Col what is one of your games that most people think is bad or mediocre at best? I think the logical answer to this, Patrick, is uh I enjoy very much a Naughty Dog game, A Hat in Time, but actually, I was thinking of A Hat in Time's competitor, Yooka-Laylee's rival, and that game is... Uh, I think the most logical answer to this Patrick is uh I enjoy very much a Naughty Bear and a lot of people think that that game is bad and it is from a technical standpoint it runs poorly. But I think the game design is cool, I think the idea is cool, I really do stand by the fact that I think that that game is a lot of fun so that's always the answer that comes to mind for me uh a pretty divisive and derided game that I",

Uh, Zack Bryce asks if the Nintendo Switch fails and they just make games and no hardware. Do you think it's possible that they release only to Microsoft platforms because of the bad blood with Sony? I've often speculated on this. I do not think that will happen considering the bad blood dating back to the Super Nintendo and the PlayStation add-on that ended up becoming a spin-off console is literally 25 years old at this point, if not more. So, I don't necessarily think that's going to happen. I don't think that makes smart business. Uh, that's not a smart business decision for them.

But I don't think that that is necessarily or even uh remotely as as tantalizing to many people as Zelda and Mario. Sean Baney asks: Monster Rancher - great game series or greatest game series or at least the first two they're some of my me favorite memories of the PS1 other than Final Fantasy Tactics uh nine, and the collections did you ever play them?

Uh those weapons are really useful uh but I would say Skull Man's in particular is very useful in that game specifically on Drill Man stage and Crystal Man stage.

You might have written this a while ago, though, the release date has been announced and they showed a bunch of videos today, so I'm actually feeling pretty confident and don't want to see any more from the game. Um, I don't necessarily agree with your assertion that they rush out games. EA has a pretty huge litany of developers and seems like they're taking their time. I mean, look what Visceral Games has been working on forever - that Star Wars game, and it's nowhere near done. Um, so I don't necessarily deal agree with that assertion nonetheless, I think Andromeda is going to be great, and I feel like because uh Mass Effect you know it by the time uh this game comes out it will have been about 5 years since since Mass Effect 3 believe it or not um and I think that one of the",
