The closer you get to the console market, the worse Nintendo looks when it comes to their future prospects as a hardware manufacturer in particular, it can be argued that they've never ever looked worse \u2013 and that's really saying something. Things start going truly bad for Nintendo and the Switch almost immediately upon the opening of the conference when it became perfectly clear that Nintendo didn't only have very many of its own games of any consequence ready to go but that it has all but failed to attract meaningful third-party attention, I tweeted out what was circulating as the Switch's launch library a meager",

I tweeted out what was circulating as the Switch's launch library\u2014a meager port-driven list\u2014but it's apparently become even more dire as of the time I'm writing this script. IGN reports that there are five games confirmed for the Switch's launch; who knows what that list will look like between now and March 3rd? But, needless to say, if Nintendo had a message to deliver here, they'd have already delivered it. Waiting for E3 isn't an excuse\u2014or at least not a good one\u2014if they had a convincing hand, they'd have shown it. To be fair, one of the games the Switch will have at launch is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which looks phenomenal; it really does. I can't wait to play it. If folks complain that Xbox One couldn't run Ryse at 1080p in 2013, they're certainly going to light up the Switch's reported inability to play Zelda at 1080p in 2017\u2014that's irrelevant to me\u2014but how",

People pointing at Xbox One's and PS4's launch lineups and calling them soft or even bad or even trying to compare the HD twins to Switch are just wrong. By the way, Xbox one and PlayStation 4 launched with a new Call of Duty game, a new Battlefield game, a new Assassin's Creed game, a litany of current sports games, indies, other third-party games, some ports, and first-party games of very varieties. Did PS3 and Xbox 360 have some of those games too? Sure, but all those games were still new, weeks old at best, at launch. There were actable, tangible reasons to buy those consoles.

Oh, in that version of FIFA for Switch, it's rumored to be a port of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 version of the game. Have fun with that. The takeaway here when looking at cursory third-party support and the silence that otherwise permeates the Nintendo Switch ecosystem is that publishers like EA have been burned too many times. They'd rather offer cursory support than actual support; they'd rather risk nothing and make nothing than risking something to make something, because they obviously don't believe the latter is possible. Ubisoft bringing Rayman Legends to Switch, which came out in 2013, is all you need to know. Or maybe it's the fact that Bethesda is bringing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim not Skyrim Special Edition, just Skyrim, to Switch. Welcome to 2011.

It reminds me of the Sony pulled with PlayStation Vita memory cards and how much that turned people off. Well, you should certainly be turned off by a $70 ask for a Pro Controller or $80 bucks for a Joy-Con set or $90 bucks for a new dock. I'm not going to linger on this point for long other than to say that these prices among others are absurd. This stuff is relevant to consumers and it should be when there are thriving consoles on the market at the price point Nintendo is charging for the Switch, and those consoles have cheaper alternatives, much more power, huge back catalogs, tons of upcoming games, vibrant online ecosystems, and more.
