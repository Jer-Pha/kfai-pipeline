The watchmaker's goal is to change the way consumers think about fashion by offering high-quality, minimalist products at revolutionary prices. With over 500,000 watches sold in more than 160 countries around the world, Movement Watches has solidified itself as the world's fastest-growing watch company. Movement Watches started at $95 and at a department store you're looking at 400 to 500 bucks, buddy. Movement figured out that by selling online they were able to cut out the middleman and retailer markup, providing the best possible price. Classic design, stylized minimalism - I said minimalism, you understand what I mean? There's all these watches; we have a bunch here. We use them when we wear suits; being me, I don't know what the other guys do.

If there's a drink in front of me, I like to drink, and I like taking large sips. Let's define this: you have a problem with liquid not necessarily an alcoholic drinking problem, just a drinking problem. Like, it is literally; I just like to drink whatever the hell it is you drink. Gasoline in front of us once? Yeah, I did a cup on the ground, stop it was 91 though. So but no, it's like when I get Cokes, I get many, many refills if I get water, I get many, many refills, and it's like... I know you are uh, but when it comes to like, I prefer the harder alcohol; I think uh, but things like Moscow Mules I",
