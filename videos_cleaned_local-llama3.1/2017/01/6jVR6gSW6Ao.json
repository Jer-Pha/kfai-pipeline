So it's just standing now that we can go in there and play VR games and not have it be a whole rig roll uh set that up. Play the first four and a half hours there. Really dug the VR experience. It you know I talked about it coming uh at PSX coming out of the demo right to our panel, the fact that I used it and I liked it but I was like h a little bit motion sick. Uh, the default way they have it set up of those 30\u00b0 turns set to the right stick really solved a lot of problems for me where I jumped in and was going and d and I played those four and a half hours uh and did not get sick and it was like I'm in this I'm enjoying this this is great.",

I think it's important specifically in shooter campaigns and I think it's very important in survival horror games - that's why Pacing and backtracking are the reason why Dead Space is one of the great um games of all time and why I think that Resident Evil even the original one, director's cut, remake, and all that kind of stuff was so good because it paced well and brought you back to places you had been and changed them slightly and increased enemy",

I feel like pretty quickly uh the game goes from being super scary to oh I understand the rules of this like this house can't scare me anymore which is a good thing I think because you do kind of not only as a character become more powerful but as a person you're like you know you're not going to get me like I know I'm safe walking through this door and very rarely is there the jump scares I thought they would rely way more heavily on the cheap tactics but they didn't",

The way you upgrade yourself or the way you make yourself stronger is clever, like finding antique coins and using them as currency to buy special things. I save them up so I can buy a magnum pistol for instance, um, the uh, which I think was pretty cool.

Like, Resident Evil 4, I played through it, but I was always annoyed with like shooting zombies or possessed people/parasites in the head and how I didn't feel as accurate. And I never ever liked the controls - and again, here the controls aren't perfect. The boss battle I struggled with was one of the reasons of like, \"Oh, he's coming at me! Oh God damn it!

Um, there's a staircase I was trying to go down and I kept getting stuck in the corner and I'm just like, oh man, like this, this is not Link, what are you doing? I'll just say my takeaway from my time with it at E3 was, you know, was brief but I felt like it was complicated. That was that was my major thing. I was like, well, this does this and you can do this with your shield and you can do this, you can slide down and then you can grab a bomb and then do this. Oh, you hit... and I'm like simplicity has always been the key with Zelda. Like I play literally every Zelda game except for Skyward Sword at some point.",

Yeah, okay, yeah. I mean, there was no sensor bar, so just making sure I didn't know if there was something on that on handheld mode or the dock that was doing something. No, just double-checking. Um, the HD Rumble stuff - uh, as I said on The Morning Show, so far feels more different than better, um. It's definitely different; the vibration is noticeable in a way that I haven't felt in video games since it started back in like Start 64, like um. But I don't know, that's a good thing - like I don't want to notice the vibration in my controller, but if gameplay you know is based on that then that could be cool. That's the whole thing right?

And it does lead to the name Switch, and like I think that a lot of why they called it that is because of how ridiculously crazy it is switching from TV to portable mode is when we saw in the Jimmy Fallon thing, everyone thought that was like a fake ass video playing, and like there's no way it'll switch that fast.

But I do think it's good that they talked about things like Fire Emblem: Three Houses (previously known as Z Blade Chronicles) that they are seemingly just putting all in on Fire Emblem in a way that I would have never expected them to. Well, I think the Fire Emblem series sold better than they expected over the last two years with Fates and Awakening or whatever the latest ones were. And I agree with what you're saying, but I would say that what you're saying is like, \"Yeah, I want to get Mario; I'm interested in all these things.\" But the vent diagram between all these games is just a **** Circle, and that's why you need to have more focus.

Yeah, um, movie buff wants to know with today's climate what are games that you think do politics correctly? I feel like this is an easy answer but I think Metal Gear Solid overall has always done a good job of presenting different opinions as convoluted as they are and different perspectives on politics and thinking that way. And it wasn't really until Metal Gear Solid 2 that I even really ever thought about our political system or ever thought about our government not being good, you know, and the government like doing shady stuff. I was it's not that but that was a game that made me think what it means to be an aide and the people close to the president and all that stuff. I mean I was I was it's funny",

And I like the way games like The Banner Saga and even Final Fantasy Tactics and stuff deal with fictional politics. Um, and uh, I think that kind of stuff's important. But I think it's essential that we let this stuff speak for itself, whether it's realistic or based on real stuff like Metal Gear, or based totally on fictional stuff like a lot of games we play. I think it's important that it's there because I think it's a good storytelling device. That's why House of Cards is so good. That's why um... but it doesn't have to be overt. Like I'm pro-choice or pro-life, politics - small P politics can mean almost anything and social views or the way you look at the world that you know, engineers uh, the way we play games and that engineers the way we are, we receive stories.

So well that it never even touched on in the first game and it only expanded on in the DLC, and it made you look at the entire other game differently. And I think that that's cool. You know? Yeah, I think indie games are doing it a lot of indie games are in the same way Colin's talking about, their art so people are bringing their perspective to it. You know? I'm playing through 2064: Read Only Memories right now still and like you know one of the big things that's going on in that universe is genetic modification and if that makes you less than human and what if you're doing is it's people who are doing it, you know, Jim Sterling's character in the game is a guy who's fiercely anti that movement right and feels those people.",
