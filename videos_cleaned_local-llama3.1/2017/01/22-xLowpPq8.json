Another one I am Adventure get on the instant messenger see what's up. I'm stoked about that. For those of you that don't know what Emily Is Away is, Away is I mean it's a game we did a let's play for it. It's a simulation, it's a step back in time where you're using AOL Instant Messenger to talk to this girl Emily and so she says stuff and then you have to pick your response and it you it's one two or three but you have to still type it out what it would be or whatever like you start typing and then it just makes it makes it feel like you're really doing it. And me and Tim started the let's play totally joking, it was like a 45-minute game too. You want to replay it for different endings, different you know how does she respond to this or that or the other thing?

U, I remember when we played it up, we tried to do a a let's play of it back way long time ago and uh, just doesn't feel right which is a shame because Shovel Knight's so **** good. Uh, I wish that they would kind of just move on but um, my assumption is that they have and and we'll find out more about that soon. But well it sounds like they're doing a lot more for this too, the King DLC and but they've they've scaled and and uh, I don't think that they're going to marinate Forever on on the original Shovel Knight.

These are iOS and Android ports of the six um the two trilogies basically from NES, and they're apparently awful. It matters to fans, and fans expect more. And then it seems like a lot of people are asleep on the Switch, and Konami - who cares what they do?

It's just that, like we didn't have because it was like you know Aid scroll, you make your own stage, just a little weird, a little share it and have a good time, whatever. But like, it's just that's not what people play PlayStation for if that was on Nintendo a long time ago and they had their own IP, Stu like that it would have been bigger sooner. It's just I think that there are expectations that are different. But I you know great artists steal and these people are stealing from each other all the time and there's no shame in that. I've said I've said over and over again that Mo for the most part, a shooter should feel like Call of Duty. You should just take that, it's okay, make your own story and your own world and your own art. But it should feel like Call of Duty.

And every platform, like Halo: The Master Chief Collection says, is it possible that Crystal Dynamics is now moving on from Tomb Raider and working on a new Legacy of Kain? Oh back in November 2015, Crystal Dynamics senior designer Michael Brubaker said that there's a 50/50 chance of a new game in the series developed by them. He goes on to say that there are in-house developers in the studio who really want it to happen. Also with the leaked Shadow of the Tomb Raider rumored to be developed by Square Enix Montreal, and the main writer of the Tomb Raider reboot series leaving the franchise, does this all point to Crystal Dynamics developing a new Legacy of Kain? Point to them making something else, I don't know that it necessarily points to them making Legacy of Kain. I don't think that would be a good idea. It seems like the time has passed for that. Say I feel like you, that's a step backwards. It's similar when we talk",
