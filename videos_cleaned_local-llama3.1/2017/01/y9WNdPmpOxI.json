It's been too long. I know, I know. He is out there gallivanting across the world leaving poor Timmy back at home. Hardly, hardly. It's kind of the other way around where you've been gallivanting and growing and the studio is amazing. We do our thing. This is the first time you've been here. This is my first time to be at the studio. Yeah. But I've been following you guys from the ground up. The ground up. Start at the bottom. Yeah. Now you're here. Yeah, that's how that works. How have you been? What's the haps? What's the haps? Well, off season is coming to an end for Hunter so he's going to head to spring training soon. What's the haps for me? Just making videos and...

I invite Tim and Nick and you guys are like, I'm not really going to go to Arizona. Arizona, it sounds hot, sounds nasty, I'm sweating. But it's a weird world there. It's actually just a big party. Yeah, and people drive around in golf carts as cars. It's a big party. Okay. I can get behind that I guess. They day drink and they just like...

It's a solar powered bobble body. Wait, what? Where's the solar power coming in? Does it have Wi-Fi? I think it has Wi-Fi, lasers, shootout. It doesn't stop dancing, though. It just keeps going?

Do you just like, do they own your likeness? Can they just do whatever they want with you? What if you were really against bobble bodies? Would you be like, nah. I think there's a way to put a stop to it. There is rumors of Brian Wilson. He used to be a closer with the Giants. I think he bought the rights to his bobblehead. So smart. And the team wanted to make a bobblehead and he said, no, you have to pay me. So he would buy the bobbleheads at $40 and sell them to the team at $60. That's some Tim Gettys shit.

Ben Affleck will not direct the Batman. This is from Variety. Ben Affleck has decided to step down as director of the Batman and remain on as producer and star of the project. Affleck is still on board to play the superhero, but sources close to the town said Affleck and Warner Bros., after discussing how to best make the film possible, came to the decision together. Affleck says, there are certain characters who hold a special place in the hearts of millions. Performing this role demands focus, passion, and the very best performance I can give. It's become clear that I cannot do both jobs to the level they require. Together with the studio, I've decided to find a",

He's backing out for the betterment of the project, because he thinks that he needs to be able to not direct and act, which is a very valid thing to say, because directing and being in a movie is like, you need to focus on one thing or the other.
