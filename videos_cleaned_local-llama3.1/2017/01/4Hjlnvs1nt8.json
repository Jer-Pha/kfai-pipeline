I use my stamina too much using the power glider. Let's see, is there a horse over there? Yep, there are horses waiting. You get there, you get to choose which horse. Well, yeah. I can go do do you want to go? We're going on the blue horse. One yeah. So they are wild horses. So like it's kind of tough sometimes. Yeah, that was cool. Very impressed.
