Um, and so I think that there is a lot of subtle politics in a lot of games, and I like the way games like The Banner Saga and even Final Fantasy Tactics and stuff deal with fictional politics, um, and I think that kind of stuff's important. But I think that it's essential that we let this stuff speak for itself, whether it's realistic or based on real stuff like Metal Gear, or based totally on fictional stuff like a lot of the games we play. I think it's important that it's there because I think it's a good storytelling device; that's why House of Cards is so good, that's why... but it doesn't have to be overt, like I'm pro-choice or I'm pro-life.\"",
