It was just one playthrough. I wanted to play the game anyway, and then the uh the second example more recently is Rime, uh which was a Tequila Works game. It's a Spanish studio Sony invested a lot of money in, uh showed it at Gamescom, uh promoted it in many sizzle reels and it shows, and then pulled the plug on that. And we found out, and recently, that it's going to come to Switch and Xbox One and PS4 this year, apparently. Um, the thing with the two prong issue with this particular cancellation is that uh Microsoft is clearly asleep at the wheel um with their exclusives. This is the third one now that's been canceled on Xbox One, uh and the other one, the Dust game Phantom Dust, and Fable... you know, like they were both just... you know, the both the plugs are pulled on both of them.

I was sounding the alarm on this very early and often with Platinum Games; that clearly something was going on with the studio. Um, and we can focus on both of those things. Microsoft's for people that don't understand the way it works when an external studio - note that all the cancellations come from outside of Microsoft Studios - they're all second-party relationships. That is, a studio is given uh the opportunity or the task of making a game so in this example Platinum Games and Microsoft get together; Microsoft's like we're going to give you x amount of tens and tens of millions of dollars and you're going to make this game for us it's going to be proprietary to us we will own the IP we will own the game itself and you will make it you will",

You can say like they didn't spend too much on Phantom Dust, which was made by an obscure Florida-based studio, and you can say that they pulled Lionhead and shut them down. And I guess actually that's not true - I want to back up: Lionhead was a first-party studio; um, so this Fable was a first-party game. So I cracked myself there - they pull the plug on these well-in-the-development Scalebound has been in development for three or four years, so they spent it's not inconceivable to assume that they spent $50 million more than that on the game, probably including exhibiting it, bringing people to these shows showing it off.

This is an interesting conundrum that they find themselves in, but the trajectory of them from their work on Wii and then you know kind of moving over to even Anarchy Reigns and all these games that people were like well these are interesting kind of or Max Anarchy was called here the the kind of interesting games Vanquish obviously and then into kind of the weird Nintendo relationship they had where they made like the Wonderful 101 but no one played it and then they",

And I feel like if with such a small team it doesn't make any logical sense from an outsider's point of view of why certain games were good and why some were bad when it was the same directors and top level teams working on them, like The Wonderful 101 despite people not playing because it was so close to a launch game for Wii U. Which we understand that story great game Bayonetta 2 great game uh Star Fox Zero **** horrible game. So I'm like what's going on there.

This is what happens when you you know in my mind you talk about a studio like Insomniac, which has always been independent but had had cultivated this relationship with one publisher in order to make a series of games, whether it's Resistance, whether it's it's Ratchet & Clank back in the day, and they cultivate this thing and they have some sort of manageable goal and manageable size and manageable kind of expectations. And then they kind of start getting in bed with other people like they're in bed with Oculus a little bit; they're in bed with Microsoft, although that that didn't seem to work out too well.

You have to assume this was going on and on and on before finally they rectified the situation at least from their perspective. And to Greg's point, the game \u2013 there are two things about Scalebound that I think are interesting and confusing at the same time: Scalebound never looked good to me, and I was always confused why people were excited about it; the game didn't run well, it looked super vanilla, and I think people reminded me of The Order: 1886 with PlayStation fans \u2013 where I'm like, \"why is anyone excited about this?\" Because we got one",

My question to you, Colin, is partly a counterpoint: do you think you keep saying that somebody at Microsoft's asleep at the wheel? My question is, is this proof of them being awake at the wheel, that them waking up to what's happening? I feel like Scalebound is a seed that was planted before Phil Spencer took over in 2014.

I bet you get something like God of War or Days Gone or Detroit: Become Human end of the year early next year. You can go listen to our PS5 episode at the end of the next three years. Sony's gonna have 10 pretty big Marquee games from God of War to Days Gone to Horizon to uh eventually Death Stranding and the last two, which I think both going to be well... I think The Last of Us Part II is going to be a very late PS4 game, I think that Death Stranding is going to be a PS5 game but it's a bad time for them not to have their ducks in a row. And that was the disappointing thing when I saw this, I was like \"I kind of\"",

I think they have to announce a new lineup of games that will support this new thing in the very NX-type or Switch-type strategy of just like, \"Hey, we were realizing we're **** up on this front, so we're going to do great over there.\" When you compare the two, not only on the more AAA first- and second-party space of the Horizon's and all that stuff, even exclusives like Persona and exclusives like near like PlayStation 4 and Yakuza \u2013 uh, in early 2017 is still so much better than what Xbox has, and it wasn't before.

I mean, I think that's obvious. Um, and money spoke very loudly. I mean, that's how they got Tales of Graces as an exclusive back in the day, and how they got... um, I can never remember the name of that... Ni no Kuni. No, wait, it was...
