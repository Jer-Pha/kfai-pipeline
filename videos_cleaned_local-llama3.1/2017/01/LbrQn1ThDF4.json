I think that these are the quiet times, these are the times I'm going to look back on when it was just us with our cool toys. Yeah, I don't think it's like... cuz I was looking at our cool spot, let's play that we did back in the day. Yeah, uh, I don't know why and I was like, \"Man, I'm very thin\" in that video, and I just realized now like this shirt is like it's like three times smaller than I guess... like I feel you watched it.

Remember that's what I always go back to for that E3 that you're talking about because it wasn't a let's play right it was just a reacts video. But when we sat down to play it, it was you, me, and two other games journalists, you know, people. And then we had one guy playing from Ubisoft, the dev, one of the devs or whatever he was Ghost One exact. Oh that's what it was, it wasn't Red Team it was Ghost One, Ghost Two, Ghost Three, Ghost Four.

It reminded me of Sea of Thieves, the Microsoft Rare game, where it's like I thought that game looked like **** garbage and even even now I'm like I don't understand why people are excited for a lot of people seem to be really excited about the game we played it and it was fun as hell at E3 but that's cuz everyone's talking like Pirates around us and Sh at home, we ain't going to be doing this **** uh maybe for a let's play with us but uh in general normal play I don't see that happening but with Ghost Recon I do see that happening it's just like it's.",

I **** nailed the **** out of this week on YouTube.com Kinda Funny shut off what making an end like I, Nick would be like all right let's count it down three two. I'm like I shot was that the right time?

You're so calling me out, and so I'm looking forward to doing that with Wildlands. I have no interest in playing this game with anyone, and uh never will, and uh but we'll definitely engage with it um because Ubisoft again has that special something in a lot of their games that I think that that speaks to me. I mean the games that I've been pondering lately going back to if I had the time, I'm not going to because I think we're going to get Neo pretty intimately then uh Horizon will I'm sure be here in the coming couple of weeks and then you know we're going to get Mass Effect and all that kind of stuff is uh I've been thinking about Far Cry 4, I've been thinking about Far Cry Primal, I've been thinking about it.",

But I don't have any specific questions because they've kind of answered the one question that I that I'm curious about, which is: Is it really playable by yourself? And the answer is yes, that's your world, which I like, and I like the idea of... this is my map and I'm slowly exploring it. And if yeah, there is a mission that ramps up in difficulty or a mission I want to farm or a mission to play on hard to get this piece of whatever loot gun, whatever - how it's going to work out then I can go get friends or vice versa.

Like yeah, sure. We all just jumped in at hoc and went in and took down this boss, and then left. And that's always fun to do. And I think you know one thing that you can't look over with Wildlands, which I think is important and I think it's relevant - it's two things. Number one is that Ubisoft seems to have a dedication to making their games better. I'm not saying that in a very PR-ish kind of marketing way; they really do. And it gives their games long tails.

Siege sold okay at the beginning, but actually more people were playing it months later and actually maybe even a year after launch than were playing it around the launch.",

And the same thing with The Division; The Division sold way better than I think anyone did, with the exception of Call of Duty and Battlefield. The Division out-sold everything else that came out last year - that's crazy! I didn't know that - that's like mind-blowing. I mean it's well, that's that thing about it is like when The Division was leading up to it and when it came out, that was the thing everyone was playing it, and then for various reasons people left, like I did or whatever, and like, and I left because the end game was just like, \"I do not want to do these same missions over and over again.\" When I I'll never forget signing on and saying, \"I've been doing this for 6 hours\" because this is the best.",
