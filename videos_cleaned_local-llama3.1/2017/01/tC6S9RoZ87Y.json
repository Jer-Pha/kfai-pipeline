That's what we're going to do again. Did we pick one? I can't remember if we picked one. We didn't really pick one. We all pick each other. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor was the one with the most kind of discussion around it where we both **** pic. Yeah. So, so there was that. Before we even get into our discussion, I want to give a shout out to Stardew Valley, Dark Souls 3, The Witness, and Hyper Light Drifter as games that weren't for us. Those aren't a thing, but everybody else is loving them. And all the comments if we didn't mention them would be like \"if I'm sorry if we're doing that then\" Rugby Simulator 20 whatever Cricket 07 (correcting the year) by Ron Henson's Cricket (correcting name and game title), I don't know if that's the guy's name or not. Ron Henson's Cricket, I I think I honestly I think uh you know Kevin can you please stop honking rude uh I don't think you know I mean",

How do they all weigh? I think Overwatch would do really well. And so I think it's worth talking more about Overwatch as a group. It's a game that I played and I'm like, I get it. I see why people like this. But to talk about a phenomenon, right, and like the way Pok\u00e9mon Go was. Overwatch has been the same thing where everyone's playing it. Everyone's obsessed with it. Everybody's digging it. And so it's not my thing, but I know how much you like it. And I also know how much hardcore players really are. Yeah. I mean, I think Overwatch is the game of the year in in terms of all the things that you're saying where it's just like this is the game.

I think that for us it's obviously not the three of our game, but I I think I think Uncharted is kind of the easy answer there. So, we've agreed uh that it's Uncharted. Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a pleasure talking to you. See you. No, I I don't agree with the methodology that says that we have to take into account anyone's opinions but our own. And so, you just No, there's no methodology. I'm just saying that I think like if we were talking as far as like something that isn't for us, but I'm not saying that needs to be our game of the year. I'm just saying we're discussing other people's stuff. Well, I just think I just think the easiest way to do it is to synthesize our list. And the two games that are ubiquitously",

And the two games that are ubiquitously on our list are Uncharted 4 and Inside and I think Uncharted 4 probably goes pretty high. I think that if I put my list in order, uh it would be top three. I'm probably definitely top five. You have it in number one. You have it in number you number it, but maybe state. It's definitely top five. Yeah. I mean, I think Inside is the superior game, but they're very different, and I wouldn't begrudge or I would understand how you would arrive at Uncharted very easily, you know, as the answer. So, I think game of the year is I think our game of the year is Uncharted 4. Um, in terms of our in terms of our own in terms of our own uh our own taste, that's all that matters. I don't care what people if people, you know, if people like Overwatch, that's great. But, but here's the thing. Is it or do you",

You're on a topic that's 4 seconds long. Greg, I don't agree with the methodology. I'm sorry. All right. Anyways, back to my point. Yeah, I don't think it's Inside because I I don't Why? Why? Cuz But don't you both like Inside more than Uncharted? Correct. I do. Uh, that's hard. I I No. No, I don't. I agree. Uncharted one. I I like Uncharted better for I think for sure. I think I'm fine with that answer as a as an experience. But what the **** is going on with this goddamn car? Uh, they're parked literally right outside and the alarm's just going off.

Yeah. Yeah, don't get me wrong, I mean, but I also I don't want to give Inside this gameplay like award is being amazing. It's like no, okay, it's a good game, it nailed its gameplay, but its gameplay was nothing revolutionary. It's something we've seen before. Yeah, yeah, but I mean, to Inside's gameplay, I think it sure, but I think it was what was really revolutionary. What was great about it was the flow of it, the way it stitched together, you know what I mean? It wasn't like I love this mechanic, what am I going to get back to?

It does. This is 100% Kinda Funny. This is this is awesome. You will live with it in a in a in a nutshell. Uh but I don't know. I Uncharted 4 it's hard for me to want to give it Game of the Year just because it is something that we've we've had so many times and yeah it does it better than the other ones I think but it's also just kind of like it's more of like a like it's it kind of reminds me of Star Wars I'm not you don't",

You imagine what's going on here punched a bear. I like that movie. Not the I don't you know. Anyways, um no, I understand like Uncharted 4 does in a way feel like a cheat card. I don't react till you guys react to it. When you react. What the **** hell? Go down there. Go talk to him. Kevin. Kevin, please give him a piece of your mind. Sound like an idiot, though. He doesn't know it's you. You're coming from a random ass doorway. No, he looked at me. Just be like, \"Excuse me, sir. I'm the I'm the fantasy movie league winner. I'll help you\"",

That Uncharted 4 in away feels like a cheat code, right? For game of the year. It's not his car. I thought so. Right. It's the car to the right. But they both have their indicators on. Cool. Will you bring me a beer? So Uncharted 4 feels like a cheat code, right? cuz it is like part of the reason it means so much and why the story resonates so much is the fact that there's been four games before it and I know these characters and I know their them and their storylines and I love them already.

It's awesome. And so but I thank you very much. All that said, I still think it is the game of the year. I mean, in terms of all that said, I the set pieces, the gameplay, the story. I just love it. Yeah. Why is it so important to you? What is it protecting? It's It's like I mean, it's purpose. Why have those if we don't use I see. Okay. Well, I respect that answer. Your fly down.

It is such a Well, and that's the thing is I think even without all that context and I know this something we used to talk we talked about a lot when it came out. Even without the context, which definitely elevates it to another degree, I think you would get in there and understand that this guy used to do stuff and okay, why is this happening and still enjoy the experience, still enjoy the game, and understand that it's a great game. No, that's true.

And especially even like that year that would have been my game of the year, but it's also like I get that it's not the game of the year, you know, because of all that stuff. And with this situation, I think it's a little bit different, but it's like I mean it is just an action romp, right? So, it's kind of like your ability to connect with the characters and all that stuff. Like, yeah, it's improved because of the experience of the past couple games. But, I don't know.

When these come around and they are especially like let's say I mean I don't know that's a bad example but sequels in general are are going to do something that's been done before and so you do want that fresh that new thing that thing that came and caught us off guard this year in games it's the best It's also Delirium.

No. Uh, I was I was just looking at my list and think about what the other game I mean it's got to be between Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and Inside specifically because of the ubiquity between all of our lists. Um, and I also think that they probably are the two Supreme games of the year in my in my mind. So, um, it's got to be one or the other. I have no problem giving it to Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. I think that's totally fine. I think Inside is more deserving, but I think that Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a certainly a fine choice for the award.
