The Nintendo Entertainment System made it possible to bring video games out of the home. Super NES added the X and Y buttons and the L and R buttons to enhance the fun. Nintendo 64 offered the world's first analog control stick and introduced a rumbling controller with the development of the rumble pack. We put a handle on the Nintendo GameCube so it could be carried around, hell yeah you did. Even at that time we were considering a home game system that you could take with you, but it seems we were a little too soon, just a little bit guys. The Nintendo DS added a touchscreen and the Wii remote enabled motion control.

Very different look, much more like Xeno than Xenoblade was, but X also seems kind of like a spin-off of Fire Emblem: Three Houses. How does that make sense? Team Ninja.
