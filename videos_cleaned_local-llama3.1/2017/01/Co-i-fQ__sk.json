    "description": "Welcome to Kinda Funny Year 3! Community is our focus in 2017, and we've heard that you want the Kinda Funny Morning Show (formerly Colin & Greg Live) on YouTube and as a podcast. So, that's what we're doing. \n\nThe Kinda Funny Morning Show will still be live on http://www.Twitch.com/kindafunnygames Monday through Friday, but from now on, the KFMS will also post here on YouTube, and eventually, it'll pop as a daily podcast. We're still troubleshooting the podcast process and expect to have it working in the coming weeks/months.\n\nCommunication is important to us, so understand that this is a whole new world for us. We're figuring it out as we go. There's a good chance that episodes of the KFMS will be muted, taken down, and so on. We're experimenting with this on the fly and learning as we go. \n\nSo, let's try something new together!\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunny\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nColin - http://www.twitter.com/NoTaxation\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller, Colin Moriarty, Tim Gettys, and Nick Scarpino talk about the biggest stories in nerd culture.",

This is your first Kinda Funny Morning Show, this is my debut. I've never done something like this before, so I'd like to get the elephant in the room out first. Alright, give me camera one, Nick. There's no better feeling in the world than sexual intercourse, and I know that this is something to go out on a limb for, but I'm telling you, Tim, yeah, the world's got to know - not enough people go to the Wii, not enough people are talking about it. What is it? Sexual intercourse? Oh, really, that was it? That was your point? Sex is good; I've been telling people that for years, man. Yeah, you know what I'm saying. I mean, I don't know how we got all this room to move again. I haven't used it in a while. You've been keeping the Tiger in the cage back there and in there, but here I am calling my...",

He made some good points about sex, it builds up when you don't let it out when you just keep it all. And I'm also on the right side. You put me on the right side today and I didn't fight it cuz it's a new show I've never hosted The Kinda Funny Morning Show. Now here's the next thing I need, here's the next thing I need Nick filling in for Big Dog Kev today so he can learn to do it. So when you guys go to New York we cannot ruin the show. We're probably going to ruin the show. Kevin, what I need you to do is go get me scissors. You might say you don't know where the scissors are.

Douglas, the 68-year-old star of the new Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra, which was awesome, told The Guardian in an interview when asked if he regretted his drinking and smoking habits in light of his cancer battle that he did not, in part because the disease is caused by oral sex. No, because without wanting to get too specific, this particular cancer is called oropharyngeal cancer, which is caused by HPV, which actually comes from Kingus. Douglas told a reporter, \"I did worry if the stress caused by my son's incarceration didn't help trigger it,\" but yeah, it's a sexually transmitted disease that causes cancer. There you go.
