Brian Artist Jackson, how would you like gaming to improve in 2017? Ponder that. Well, I think what I think what EA just did today is we're recording this with a release date from aspect being announced, what early two and a half months or so before the game comes out, I think is a great example of what we've been talking about - keeping your cards closer to your vest until you're ready to say something about giving people something really exciting in a finite amount of time with something that's imminent. I think it's a really cool thing we've seen, and sporadically we've also seen the opposite with what Rockstar did with Red Dead Redemption too. So that's one way I'd like to see gaming improve is to publishers take your time, developers take your time, and when there's something to say, say it.",

There will always be delays for the rest of time, sure. But I hope and I expect in '17 they won't have as many people talking about it, thinking people are gonna keep their mouths shut a bit better, yeah. And it's like going back to what we call him saying. I think that like those are things that go hand in hand. And I think then 2017 hopefully a lot of games will be on time, like I was wrong thinking that Horizon was going to get delayed by the end of 2016, so I hope that that stays true, yeah. I hope the Switch is awesome. George Barrett says, \"Do you guys have any gaming New Year's resolutions?\" I want to play more games; I feel like that's such an easy thing to say, sure. Probably not going to be able to stick to it as much as I'd like to, but I have fun playing games, you know.

And the few times I've been able to play things recently, I'm like, \"Man, I love 'Horizon Zero Dawn', love you, 'Final Fantasy XV'! Like, why don't I do this more?\" I think the one thing for Game Over Greggy is that I did a topic of where I went through all the games I watched. I want to keep a better track of everything I play this year because I feel like when we're doing a game of the year stuff and rounding up, like I look at my trophies which is pretty great, but then I almost forgot that it got in mentioned, but I forgot that I played 'Gone Home' or whatever. Not that I was gonna put that on my list, but I had fun with it, and it's a game that I'm like, \"All right, I played that, and like that\"",

But there's a lot of great games coming out this year or games that I'm excited about - we're going to get Resident Evil 7 and I'm gonna get Nioh (not Tails Obras Area), which I'm super-excited about. We're going to move right into Horizon and we're going to play Mass Effect. There's a lot of stuff in the first quarter. How it presents itself, man... I always forget it's Super Bowl Sunday - is it the 20th-24th? Holy crap, twenty days really, really excited about that. We might get it at any moment.

And that's where the Beetle Act and putting the Antenna Games on there when it is Nintendo just focusing on one library instead of the Wii U and 3DS. Like man, it's very exciting to be a Nintendo fan, which is awesome to say because it's been like 10 years.
