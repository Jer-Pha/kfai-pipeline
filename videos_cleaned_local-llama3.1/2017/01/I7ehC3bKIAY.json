            "text": "oh Hey Hey this episode of The GameOverGreggy Show was brought to you by Blue Apron. I've talked about Blue Apron quite a bit, ladies and gentlemen, because you know # cooking with the Gregy - I cook all the time, and Blue Apron was a gift my mother gave me last year. I'm pretty sure she did not use the code; I'm not sure if we had the deal. But basically, Blue Apron sends you all the fresh ingredients you need to make awesome meals. And you might say, Greg, \"I have no talent at cooking like you do.\" And I will tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, I once had no talent at cooking either - before I became the male Rachael Ray. Basically, all you need to do is these are 30-minute meals for the most part; they send you the instructions, you go through step by step with the pre-portioned ingredients, and you make whatever you want. Do you want to know some of the upcoming meals? Hell yeah, you do! Seared pork chops with farro, pharaoh, and cranberry chutney - I don't even know what that is, but it sounds good.",

Seared pork chops with farro, pharaoh, and cranberry chutney. I don't even know what that is, but it sounds good. Spaghetti squash and marinara with mushrooms and garlic knots. Garlic nuts are great. Spicy shrimp and Korean rice cakes with cabbage and furikake. I can't be right how you pronounce that, but that's how I'm going to do it anyways. It's affordable; it's less than $10 per meal for per person. Uh, they deliver it all to you. It's seasonal; it's flexible. You get to go online pick your meals. Everything's great. So here's what you do: check out this week's menu and get your first three meals free with free shipping by going to blueapron.com/greggy. You will love how good it feels and tastes to create incredible home-cooked meals with Blue Apron. So don't wait; that's blueapron.com/greggy. Blue Apron, a better way to cook.",

I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the producer Nick Scarpino. Top of the morning! I love this sweatshirt. Where did you buy the terry cloth sweatshirt? I think this is a Marine Layer sweatshirt. I got it from a local San Francisco brand, Marine Layer - they make them in uh, in the city as well; they're made over in the Mission. Okay, it's fun. I don't know if they still sell this. I'm sure they still sell us sweatshirts like this, but maybe it's a different material though. But she wants a terry cloth one. I'll get you a ter cloth one, thank you. They're very warm. You look warm; you're covered but you look... yeah, that's why you're wearing them because I've been a little sick and I was very cold last week which added to the sickness, I think.
