I cook all the time, and Blue Apron was a gift my mother gave me last year. I'm pretty sure she did not use the code; I'm not sure if we had the deal. But basically, Blue Apron sends you all the fresh ingredients you need to make awesome meals. And you might say, Greg, I have no talent at cooking like you do, and I will tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, I once had no talent at cooking either, before I became the male Rachael Ray. Basically, all you need to do is these are minute meals for the most part; they send you the instructions, you go through step by step with the pre-portioned ingredients, and you make whatever you want. Do you want to know some of the upcoming meals? Hell yeah, you do! Seared pork chops with farro, pharaoh, and cranberry chutney. I don't even know what that is, but it sounds good; spaghetti.",

Yeah, um, I've been dying to hear your thoughts on this because we...I haven't seen you since the uh or we haven't talked since the trailer came out. No, no, and I so just to stop right here if you don't know what Amazon Go is, I want you to stop this podcast pause it if you're on YouTube or whatever just wait until you get home if you're listening to a podcast go watch the video just look for Amazon Go trailer Amazon Go commercial and just watch it. What basically is...and really you really should watch it. What it basically is is a story with no employees, and uh like like a grocery store convenience store uh in which uh no one works on the floor.

That's a great time period that we're in, but it's also one that's very quickly coming to an end.
