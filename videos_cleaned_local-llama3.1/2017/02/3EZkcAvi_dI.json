And uh, and you know when I started at Bethesda 17 plus years ago, that's what Bethesda was. I mean the team working on Morrowind at the time was in one hallway; it was probably 12 people that I that I sat with. The company total was you know maybe 25 or so in Bethesda. Uh, we're probably over 1500 now and offices all over the world. And and all of that but it's um, you know, a chance to um, to work in an industry that um, you know, means something to me.

We were doing IHRA drag racing games for a while, and I was up in Indiana once and Michigan once to do some different drag race events. Um, and you know because we were making a lot of money off of making drag racing games go really fast straight for a quarter of a mile; we could render really well for this quarter of a mile. Um, and how you get there is by first of all recognizing sort of who you are and what you're about, which is we're Bethesda... We're not ever going to try and build to do 10, 20, 50 uh games a year; we don't make...

You know it was never our intention to say we need to buy X number of studios in the next few years; it was let's just find cool people to work with. In the case of Arcane, we finally sort of got on their radar where they didn't have a project they were moving on to next and we started working with them on what became the original Dishonored.

He's like, \"Well, Shinji Mikami is you know looking to do survival horror. He's got this studio we should talk to them,\" and these guys at Star Breeze all left, and there's a core of them that you know they started MachineGames, and they really interested in doing Wolfenstein. Like each of those things kind of on their own sounded like good opportunities, and sort of got us to where we were in 2015 and and where we are today.

No, I can't do that on this one. Every project for me it was a pretty easy lesson to learn early on because so much of the stuff that I was working on was this like... I mean I think we may have talked about this before but like my first press tour was just this dog's breakfast of video games. Like uh, we had just shipped PBA Bowling right before I started at Bethesda in 1999. Who can forget? Uh, we were working on IH Drag Racing, Skip Barber racing.

Um, my brother's actually been through the Skip Barber Racing School. Was he in the game? Uh, he was not, which never shipped, so nobody technically in that game. Um, we were working on Sea Dogs, which was a, uh, naval-based RPG based out of Russia. We were working on Echelon, which was like a fighter, futuristic fighter thing. Like it was just all over the place, and there really wasn't anything like... Oh, we could just kind of formulate: what are you going to take from IH Drag Racing that applies at all to Sea Dogs? Like it was just this... We were kind of all over the place in the kinds of stuff we were trying and doing. Um, so no, I, uh, I knew early on like yeah, this is going to be like starting all over from scratch every single time, every single game, just because ultimately that's mostly what it felt like you shift from a naval-based RPG to IH Drag Racing too.",

So you know we talked about all these games you're putting out that I think are you know extraordinary, you know what I mean? Whether it be Fallout, whether it be Dishonored, whether it be Elder Scrolls and stuff like that. You have this reputation right now for putting out these amazing games, everybody loves Bethesda, you guys fire on all cylinders, and but I think that becomes the herd mentality. You guys have been known to get away with praying to pray to right, we're not going to do this game anymore, we're going to get it right when how at what point in development do you know oh my God we're on to something crazy good like Doom or do you know like okay something's really wrong and we have to start thinking about cutting pre-to um and those are just examples sure um it's it's",

The goal of game development is when we're done, we have something really fun and interesting and unique that people are going to want to play and enjoy and when they do play it, they're like wow this is really cool. Um, you should play it, you should try it, Dishonored 2, Doom, like those games. Um, hit that bar reach that goal just finishing the game is not good enough and and our belief has always been you know kind of going back to our core philosophy that ultimately the game is the thing and and it's a really hard decision to cancel a game or to start over or to delay a product all of those things we take really seriously because you know we are running a company that pays salaries to people.",

So delaying stuff has real consequences, but you have to do what's in the best interest, which is long-term. The thing that we make has to really resonate with the audience it's intended for or like we're screwed. Doesn't matter how many ad dollars you spend; it doesn't matter how many people you know you get to stream the game. Like it's just going to die before you ever get started, and so you... You don't always enjoy making those decisions. But ultimately, if we're going to succeed and we're going to continue to go forward, you've got to be able to step back and say like are we actually going to get to where we intend to or has this all been for not?
