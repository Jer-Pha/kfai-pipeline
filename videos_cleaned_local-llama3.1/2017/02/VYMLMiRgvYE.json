The reason I asked this question is twofold: one is that I've been playing with this idea recently, uh, not necessarily an unprecedented idea, but the idea that the government could be run like a business. But could the government really be a business? In other words, could the government come and say we want to invest a half a trillion dollars over 10 years in curing cancer, with the anticipation that we will find some sort of tangible cure that we can then sell to the rest of the world? Sure, uh, and have our American scientists use American technology to find an American cure for cancer that we can then distribute to the rest of the world and make that money back. In other words, not just a sunk cost of $500 billion, but saying like we can make maybe a few trillion dollars on this um",

The more tangible reason that I bring this up is I tweeted this out the other day because Donald Trump is going after the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, which I think is totally ridiculous. NEA by the way spends about half a billion dollars a year, which has been spent in the time I've been talking about this by the federal government, so just no money at all. But I found the statistic interesting; I actually dug this up - this isn't a statistic I found, I actually just did the math. In 2016, $68.3 billion dollars was spent by the American government on the NEA, which is Arts and Humanities, so was paying artists and historians and whatever to do work, the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA of course, MPS",

We have 4% of the world population, got to keep starting those Wars. So I'm curious about is if you guys have a philosophical kind of take on this, and how do you feel about the idea of the American government actually functioning as a corporation - and say finding like I had this idea, I was talking about this to someone just just set it up see what you guys think. I was like, what if the government found a hundred very smart scientists of different ilks? We got roboticists, you got biologists, you got astrophysicists all sorts of things - they send proposals into a small bureaucracy that that they're like \"I want to do this\"",

So by analogy exactly. So I'm curious what you guys think about those two ideas and if we should kind of withdraw from those things uh based on philosophy or or put money into them and if it's important that we do those things as a society, remembering of course that we landed on the moon spending an exorbitant amount of money back then - it would be almost a trillion dollars actually today. Which is a lot of money in 1969, in 1969 that's exactly correct over this long period of time seventeen Apollo missions but we did that as a society and we can and we put our flag into the Moon Yeah and said that we did this together so how do you guys feel about all that I mean I think we I mean in general I think we spend way too much money on the military I think our priorities in that in that",

If so, I'm in. Yeah, I think the argument you make I think government is supposed to be altruistic and and typically does run in that in that sense. Um, uh, I think the big question there twofold: one is what you brought up, and the other so if the money is invested um you know let me back up what would be interesting is if the government said hey we're going to chase a cure for cancer - nebulous thing we're going to chase a cure for cancer we're going to invest a ton of money in it like just a ton of money we're going to going to we're going to recruit the greatest scientists, give them the greatest resources, greatest facilities and they're going to get it if we get it this is what the budget looks like 10 years from now.\"",

Sure, but if it doesn't work then this is what's on the books and what we owe in other words. It's not really an interesting idea of how government might be able to function. The bigger philosophical question is: If the American government founded a cure for cancer and then started charging everyone for it, that would be like... how like the government is - \"we have it, we know how to do it.\" Which, there's no way around that right? Well, whoever comes up with a cure for cancer is going to charge for it. So, I mean, whether it's like Pfizer is going to charge for it so is it really that wrong",

I mean I feel like it is, I agree, yeah I feel like just because like based on what you're saying it's just like the moment especially when our tax dollars are going towards funding this and stuff it's just like giving them that level of control where it's like you have to buy stuff. I I guess even now you have to buy like with with all like healthcare and stuff right like with them not providing you still need to pay for these services, I don't know it gets complicated. These numbers are interesting to me because while I also don't agree that this much should be going towards the military, I am shocked that that much is going towards those things like 70 billion dollars obviously a lot of money, not as much compared to 600 but that's still a much higher",

Yeah, it's worth noting that NIH, which is the National Institutes of Health, they research cures and all those kinds of things, spent half of it; the NEA spent less than $1 billion of it, so the number is a little misleading. But even then, like them spending over I believe $10 billion on health is way more important than Arts, you know, and I feel like there has to be like a hierarchy to all of this stuff and like I do believe that Arts are important uh but it really comes down to okay, but how important are they compared to people's well-being and all these other things and I think that even the idea of let's say a percentage of it, like $20 billion or $10 billion, like how much needs to go towards these things",

There would be cures for things that we couldn't possibly imagine. You'd all speak in Russian, though. They would have come over; I don't know. We would have cured all their cancer. Well, I made this point in the subsequent episode: given them all ours that we could, we could cut the military in half. Give these people twice as much money if you wanted to - just as a theory - and still cut the budget by $150 billion. Yeah, that's how much money.

Your original question, by the way, is very fascinating because when you start to break down you start to ask yourself why the military budget is so big. It's obvious the answer is obvious right, because that's where a lot of the profits are built into um there's a ton of profit in war, it's the military-industrial complex - All That Jazz. So the question becomes if you then were to offset that with there being a bigger margin in another area what would that do to them, the military?

And you have to ask yourselves: like Donald Trump is on to something interesting, I think, with one of these particular things which he's saying - NATO, or na, um... NATO, particularly. Like, we pay for NATO; basically people on NATO, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is basically designed to keep the Russians away from Western Europe, that's the entire idea of it since the Soviet Union.

Our art makes us American; our entertainment makes us American; our science makes us American. These are the things that define us. The Department of Energy doesn't make us American; it doesn't need to exist. The Department of Education doesn't need to exist; that should be happening at a state level, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be investing in things.

So much money that we're going to have to find clever solutions in the next few decades to pay it back, or we are going to be **** because anyone that runs around saying sovereign debt should always be this high is nuts - the sovereign debt is higher than many times higher than even GDP, you know, like so could we find a clever solution to say like hey NASA here is $50 billion, we want you to go do all these cool things, you might want to figure out how to mine that asteroid in the next 20 years and we can take that metal and sell it on the market saying this.",
