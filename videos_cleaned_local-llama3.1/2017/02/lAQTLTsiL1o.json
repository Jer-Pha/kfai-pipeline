I made it sound like I was saying I was ending a thought that was angry, but I really just said what I say. ERS can go to hell. No, you liked it when it was perfect with the audio person who messed it up - Tim. Did I snap my fingers? He didn't snap and point; he just said 'the audio is going live.' Sometimes when he says the audio goes live, I like to mess around and toss in some Easter eggs. I do the old 'give me my one,' give me my one. This whole process needs to be streamlined - it's not streamlined there need to be less you know motions going on. On I think there needs to be more motion again. We have all this room, well we can have motion. You know what we should do? That was way too much. I felt like the wind, like the you're making wind there's a lot of wind in here.

Warren Ellis will be serving as the show's writer and producer. Comic book fans may know him from the Expanse, Saga, and Iron Man. I say that right? Exist and much more. Shankar also revealed a second season will come in 2018 via his Facebook page; he had a quote about it being \"rated R\" or something right? Yeah. Nintendo Wire. I mean okay, let's do the math here, Greg. Rated R is **** AI Shankar if you don't know who that is, the guy that did the Power Rangers short last year, oh nice, which is awesome.
