Um, another I'll give a quick shout out to as far as bad movies are concerned, and again a movie that I never thought I'd watch. Now here's my question though: Are these bad movies yes no? Dirty Grandpa's not bad, Dudley Grandpa is not a bad movie. Dumb and Dumber is a classic, it's bad. I think it's it's a **** hilarious comedy. It's but like you're talking about a movie that's in the same genre as like a Caddyshack or like a Fletch or any of those classic movies that you would have watched during the time you were like all right, that's really funny.

No, I don't think that's a bad movie, but I do think there is a category of bad movies that are good. I do think we have to make that distinction right. I feel like there's movies that are trying to be good movies that know what they are and then legitimately shitty bad movies that just have no you know redeeming qualities whatsoever. Um, like I watched um that I mean that that I would probably put in the bad movie category because it just didn't really it didn't it didn't work as a film.

That is, let me put it this way: if the American government paid for nothing but collected the amount of taxes that it collects right now - which is to the tune of like three and a half trillion dollars a year or so - it would take the government seven years to pay back the debt without paying for anything else other than servicing the debt, and serving both the principle and the interest on the debt.
