And so, so what you just were referencing there, we haven't formally talked about this on the Gamescast yet. Uh, E3 is now going to be open to the public. There was 15,000 tickets sold. Is it every day or is there a famous public day? I think it's every day. Every day. Yeah, cuz I know that there were two different ticket options. One was the whole thing and one was just a one-day pass, right? For 15,000 tickets of just public attendees. Was it 15,000? Damn, that's a lot. Yeah, 15,000. Okay. Uh, to be at E3. Um, in addition to that, there have been a couple changes announced with conferences. Just today as the time of recording this, Microsoft announced that they will be doing their press conference on Sunday, June 11th. Now it's a Tim show. Tim and Tim talk about games. Schafer and Gettys. The Shit Yards",

Traditionally, it is it is always bend over when you walk in front of the camera like the Elmo draft house. just bet not that. He's like, \"How am I gonna get my butt on camera today? How am I gonna He always finds a way. He looks so tall over there.\" He's good. He's a tall man. Greg Miller. Very tall. Yeah. Like scary tall. Keeps the internet from talking **** when they see you in real life. Every everybody's tough online. They see you towering over him, but a pack's like a big fan.

Then this is weird because normally, traditionally, and for like every year that I can remember, at least, Microsoft and Sony would both go on Monday. Right. Right. The last couple years, E3's been a **** **** show. Everybody just like Bethesda is all of a sudden like, we're doing a **** conference. It's like, all right. Nintendo's like, \"Fuck this. We're just doing directs.\" And like it's like, \"You guys are crazy.\" EA's like, \"We do that, too. We're just doing our own thing.\" get involved in like an indie group that shows their games before cuz like it's everyone is so busy these things get so big. You're like, \"Oh, my appointment calendar is full the entire week. Can we just meet the weekend before? Can I show",

Mhm. Yeah. That's what we did last year. That's when we played all the games at Double Fine. But that's fine. I'm fine with that. I just like the tradition of E3. I like that there I knew what I was getting into every year. Moving it to Sunday. Not a fan of this. All right. Bethesda did it and I was like, I understand that and I respect that. But when do you want to start? I I was fine with Monday mornings forever, but now we're starting on Sunday nights. Bethesda's got to get a word in edgewise. I understand the Walking Dead. Exactly.

So looking at the schedule now, obviously it's a little early for everybody to put out what exactly they're doing, right? That's why I was blown away about to open my inbox today and see this thing for Microsoft. But the other thing to keep in mind is when you're going to make when you're going to make a change like that, uh you got to put it out there so that other people don't schedule things against it because the last thing you want to do is create a scenario where people you want to be there or to be watching it now need to divert their attention, right? That's that's a bad look. Um EA is going to be Saturday, June 10th. There's not a time yet, but that's EA Play or whatever",

And so that's the thing is like when when it comes to this year now that it's a more or it is a public event for the first time ever. Not that it was ever too difficult to get in if you really wanted to. Uh now you can literally buy a ticket which changes the dynamics of what E3 is. Do you guys think that this is a good thing, bad thing, pros and cons? Let's start with let's start with the the public thing. Sure. Yeah, that's for sure. Pros and cons.

E3 is I have appointments to get to every time. So, the idea of 15,000 more people in there who might be milling about a bit more is off-putting to some people, right? Running between appointments, getting out, which does happen every time. I'm late to every appointment at E3 and it's not because I scheduled them poorly. It's because I give myself a five-minute window and then I'm getting stopped by someone I know, someone I don't know, somebody wants a photo. It's just or it's just jam-packed people everywhere and it's a pain. They have to move around. So, to add more people into that, I understand the uh I think it's I think",

I remember being on the outside reading Electronic Gaming Monthly, reading about E3 and man, I can't wait to go there. And I understand that not everyone's dream is to work at IGN or whatever. And so that's they're never going to go. Here's a chance to go. I my fear about this E3 being open to the public is that I really feel a lot of fans could easily be burned coming away from it. I have a feeling that people are going expecting the E3 experiences they've seen on all-access shows, they've seen on press conferences that they've read about the experiences we talk about. What do you think they won't be able to do? They think they're going to be able to attend conferences. Yeah. Everything will play games, go to conferences, talk to people.

I I mean I Well, I don't know when soon for Full Throttle, but Full Throttle would be I mean, it might even still be there just because it's a new release for them. That's how they do it. And so that's fine. If you're if your if your if your preconception is set to that, it's very it's a No Man's Sky situation. If your standards are set for what this is realistically going to be, you're going to have a great time and it's going to be a PAX of, \"Yeah, I waited two hours in line and we went and saw a 15-minute demo of this thing that was",

If you go in there and you think that it's going to be, oh my god, this is going to happen. Blah blah blah. You're not going to get that experience. And then my other concern is, and I don't and so I don't know if uh ESA has thought that through when they've planned this E3 of what are they really giving the consumer. The other concern is what are publishers and booth people who are setting up this or third party. Anybody who's having a booth 83, have they thought about this? Are they all going to go the way of what Warner Brothers does, which is there is just a walled booth and then there's some TVs on the outside, but all the stuff is on the inside and you need an",

On top of that, how is ESA or video game publisher X, developer X going to deal with the fact of a Tim, of a Kojima, of a whoever walking through that thing? I talk about a PSX where they had to give me security, right? Like what? I wear a uh Greg Miller mask and no one talks to me. Ah, no. No, but I mean like think about like you know Kojima running from the GameSpot booth to the IGN booth which are next to each other but still that's entering into now a very public hall and going over two booths or one booth over.

Exactly. I'm a bit on the other side of this. Like I'm not so much on the doom and gloom and you know all the the cons of it because I do think at the end of the day this is just making it a pack. And it's like if you enjoy going to packs you're going to enjoy going to this I think even more just in the sense that like if you're going there to play games and if you're going to other events you're not going to play a 100 games you're going to play maybe three games a day.

It's like what's the point of doing that if there's no one there watching?

But if we go back to that, I I'm more I definitely more comfortable with that because everyone knows it' be great to have more Paxes, you know. Well, I don't know if we need more Paxes. The thing not that I had to go to, but so everyone has one near them that they can get. What could be interesting is the fact of I think this is E3 searching for its identity in a changing world.

That's when it starts to go. And I wonder how long it's going to take. You know, we had Pete Hines in recently and he's talking about Bethesda's attitude and how direct they are and how they're handling. And I thought it was really refreshing how long it takes everyone to wrap their head around that and realize that you could go to PAX and do that there. You could go to PAX and have, hey, we are Activision. Here's the Activision panel in the main in pack in the main PAX hall and we're going to show you all these new trailers, all these new exclusives.

This is what I'm most concerned about. I think that the opening of E3 to the public is really good for this reason. I don't want E3 to die. E3 is dying and being there last year, it's like without Activision and EA there. Counted out D3 before like it's been dead before. Oh, it's dead. But even I saw the Gamecock funeral parade in Santa Monica, sir. But but the thing that I think is important to keep in mind is that E3 being dead, E3 the show, E3, what E3 means to all of us is different than what E3 actually is. E3 is just it's a convention that's 3 days or whatever, but we count the press conferences in that. We we count the entire week of an experience that people",

We count the entire week of an experience that people have. And I think that it's important to recognize that the press conferences have nothing directly to do with E3 itself. It's just traditionally since uh this big thing is happening that's just when they make all the announcements because that makes sense, right? But it's like the moment what if Xbox was just like we're doing this thing and they put the date out and it was like April 10th. Yeah. You know, I feel like even if it's like a cycle, even if it splatters and like it spreads out to all these different little mini press conferences they show, like a couple of them would be like, \"Hey, you want to team up on our press conference cuz we get more people to come.\" And then they go, \"Oh, hey, we should have the whole show. We should call it E3.\" like it'll come back to life again",

So, it just seems to grow like it seems to be like this uh life form that kind of like scatters and then regrows every time. The reason I brought up PAX and Activision going there and do something is the point I I lost there in the weeds was the point I was trying to make is the fact that as E3 becomes more like a PAX, it is going to be compared more and more to PAX. And that's what I'm saying is I think pound-for-pound this year in terms of a community-focused show, PAX is going to be better than E3.

It's like that opportunity would still be there and you could go to PAX and you could just own it. You could be at PAX East and you could be the biggest **** thing that happened at PAX East and everyone's talking for that weekend. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It's You bring up a good point about everyone all around the world flying out for E3. I think E3 is unique in there. There is the marketing teams, the sales teams, all I can meet with everybody.

I think E3 is unique in that there's the marketing teams, the sales teams, and all I can meet with everybody. They're all going to be there. Yeah. And it's like I think that's the one thing that makes me think Xbox couldn't just back out and just be like we're just doing our own event, nothing to do with E3 because you know everyone still needs to be part of that conversation because they still need to have the meetings with all these other people. I swear to God this building has more ambulances and police cars than any other building is ridiculous but I'm interested like this year there's a bunch of questions I want to know, Bethesda are they going to have another conference? Nintendo are they going to do a direct or are they going to do a conference? I think they're going to do a direct and I think we all were like come on yeah you've got the Switch under your belt, do a conference. Oh God, why did you do a conference?

But that's the thing - this is different because this is in America. If they did a conference at E3, and again, I'm a big fan of direct presentations. I think they should do a direct. I don't think there's any reason for them to do an on-stage type presentation at all. But if they did, it'd be Reggie - it would be a totally different vibe. It wouldn't be the awkward ass translations. So I think there's a chance that they'll do that. And either way, when does that happen? Traditionally, they've been doing it on Tuesday mornings. Yeah. Which is very in the way of everything. I don't know why they do that. Um, and then Sony does change their time now that Microsoft is... you think Sony's still Monday nights? Yep. Not Monday earlier because they have the time slot. No. I mean, think about it - it just works.",

And it's still the same thing. Cuz I was thinking the whole time - isn't it Monday? Don't they go on Mondays though? It's Monday night, right? Yeah. What did I just say? You said they go in on Monday, and that's all people are talking about. Tuesday morning. Oh, okay. Tuesday you wake up and talk about it. Yeah. Well, there's the Nintendo thing happening.

Oh, well, don't worry, they'll do a conference next year. It'll be great. They'll show the Switch. Uh, I think that nothing changes for Sony. They still have everybody before them. I think it's interesting. I think Microsoft moving out gives them theoretically, depending on what Bethesda does, a day to be the biggest thing going, right? And I think that's the same thing. Phil Spencer driving by super stoked that I'm but I think Xbox gets to end that day especially with Scorpio talk of like hey we get to own pretty much a 24-hour news cycle in video games about Scorpio and that's all you get to talk about rather than it be that we announce Scorpio in the afternoon and then",

I think we all did after year one where I thought year one they did it and I was like, \"Oh, wow. That was a really bold move, but like they they they led up here and they had all the cards and everything's played. It was perfectly in place. They can't do it again next year, which sucks.\" But that was a good year for them.

MachineGames uh for the next Wolfenstein. They'll have that to talk about. Like they're going to have more and more to talk about. But I mean, so now they'd be going on the same day as Microsoft and it typically I think that they they went at 5. I thought it was seven, but yeah, whatever. I mean, it'd be an evening conference after Microsoft. Yeah. You don't think they go Saturday? No. Could be instead. I don't No, I don't because I don't think that's I don't think that's so much Bethesda's concern. I think the fact they went where they went on Sunday before was the fact that that's we want to do a press conference.

Yeah, because again, it's apples and oranges because you figure it's going to be Microsoft's new console, State of Decay 2, Crackdown release date, whatever they're going to do. We have all this cool stuff and what's coming up for the next year. That's awesome. But we're all going to talk about Scorpio, Bethesda, here are these awesome games.
