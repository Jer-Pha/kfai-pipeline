Surprisingly funny, surprisingly funny. And that guy who runs the liquor store, oh God, he's hilarious. It reminds me in this sense of two movies that I was like, \"There's no way these movies are good\" when I was in college, and then I watched them both and they're awesome. One was 40-Year-Old Virgin, awesome, and people were like, \"I was like, 'This movie sounds awful.' The trailers look awful.\" There's funny about this, I watched it and nearly peed my pants watching that movie. It was so funny. And Grandma's Boy is the other one where I'm like, \"This movie is literally one of the funniest things I've ever seen to this day.\" It's relatable to us as gamers, but that movie doesn't sound good, but it is.

There are a lot of movies like that, even \"The Wedding Crashers\" and ***, like that, where I'm like, this doesn't look fun at all, and it's awesome. Well, you know what it is? It boils down to like um... I'm pretty sure all those movies just listed are R-rated, and the fact that they can do whatever they want, and \"Dirty Grandpa\" definitely pushes a lot of limits as far as what you see in the R-rated version; oh no, the R-rated version - that's right, he has his dick just straight up in that guy.

That's different though, that's not a thing of like needing the validation, that's a thing of just like, I know you're going to like this but like when it started he was like yeah, getting really into it and I was like, I'm not there yet, I'm not matching that energy, I'm getting there, you know what I mean? But like, but you've already said because you know what I mean, like from the day before he was still amped on it. Like John Wick Chapter 2, great movie, but it gets you in that head space for it, whereas I'm like, I haven't seen a John Wick in a year and a half since the last one, I saw the last one or whatever it was so I'm like, I saw it on video, I don't know, I saw it, um, I just like you haven't seen a John Wick",

Simmons doing whatever the **** he wants to do the entire time and the writing is catchy and the actors really nail it. But there is an underlying dramatic element to it that I think actually does kind of back it up toward the end, because you know it's kind of pushing with that, so you're actually invested in the characters when these things happen to him, you're like okay, I get that. Um, having said that, of course everything I just said does not apply to Caddyshack and Caddyshack is one of the greatest comedies if not the greatest comedy of all time, I think a perfect example of what I'm saying is like Superbad, Superbad I would say is probably something that most people could unite on deciding is one of the greatest comedies of the last 10 years, right?

But it's like that movie falls apart in the second half, like the second half is nowhere near as dark. Yeah, and it's nowhere near as funny as the first half, like when he comes out and he's like I'm addicted to drawing dicks, that's **** hilarious. And there's the flashback to him in third grade drawing a bunch of dicks, that's **** funny. And then it's like, then you get to the end of the movie and it's just like I don't know everything just feels like it's way too serious, I'm like that's like Knocked Up, right?
