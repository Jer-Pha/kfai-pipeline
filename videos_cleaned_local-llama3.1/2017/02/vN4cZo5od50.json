So, Greg, I heard that you want to handle this, uh, so we just totally fake it from the beginning? Fake it from the beginning, sir. It's the only way we know how? All right, hold on. Let me do it again. Garbage truck on fire. Rolled into Australia! Hey, guys. So I'm Tim Gettys. You might know me from Kinda Funny. Unfortunately, Greg got in trouble, because it's Australia, and Australia has weird rules, and we're not allowed to do the things that we thought we were gonna do. So it's just me. Tim Gettys. I'm all you get. You don't even get Colin. You don't even get Nick. You get me. I'm sorry, but... Hello? Hello? Yeah, what's up, Greg? So we're gonna do the, the Enter Sandman theme from ECW.

See, this is why they wouldn't let us do this, Greg. And now, because of some weird rules, we need to not even play the song, we need them to sing the song, you realize this is gonna be a disaster, right? I mean, yeah, I'm down to go for it. Are you guys down to go for it? Yeah! Are we still gonna dim the lights, or is that now just not safe? Oh, we're still gonna dim the lights. Cause that's how we fucking do in America.

I don't know, that's a great question. I mean, are we afraid of copyright jail? We're not, but is there like, a way to get the hell out of here? I mean, I don't know, I don't know. We're not, but is there like a voice of God telling me not to do that? I went towards someone I thought was the voice of God. The look of God backstage tells me don't do that.

But they did say that that would happen, and it did. Now every time I open a beer too, I get to go like that. I don't know how Neil Gaiman did this. I don't appreciate any of this. Now do people, remember when you were like, you didn't put on the pigeon shirt? What? Pigeon shirt? Yeah, oh, you didn't bring the pigeon shirt? I retired the pigeon shirt. Oh, my apologies.

If we can be 1,000% over, you got breaking news? I got breaking news. Because we fucked up so bad, this panel's going to be extended a little bit. Oh, yeah, no, no, no.

We love calling. Kevin, though. Jesus, does my ass really look like that? Is that a hole? Is there a hole? Look, oh, god. Is it a what? No, no, it's not. Everybody tweet this photo.

Do you want an Australian hunter hunting the most elusive game, or do you want someone for this panel who will be our latest concubine? OK. I'm into the second one just by default. I don't want any more Australians. We had some Australians on my panel yesterday, and that did not end well. These are Australian best friends, though. It'll be a different story. These are the homies. All right. I mean, can we bring out the concubine? Sure. So we can say cunt here, but I don't know if concubine's allowed as like a thing anywhere. Thank you very much.

Let me tell you about it. So what happened is it turned out, Krypton, when it blew up, still some people were alive on it. One of them, Justine Bateman. Do you know Justine Bateman? Thank you, Daddy. Justine Bateman came down. She was one of the Kryptonians. And so she was like, well, Kal-El, you've got to come back and rule the little piece of Krypton we have. And for some reason, Dean Cain Superman was like, yeah, OK. And I was like, that was fucking stupid. So he went up there.

I need someone who wants to come up here and help me with a physical challenge throughout this show. You, sir, you've been active in everything. Now, I'll tell you right now, it's hard to get up here. Try it. The sit and roll. I just tried talking into my beer. That was an interpretation. Now that you're here, well, first off, introduce yourself. I'm Joel. Joel, you've been around for a while. Don't open it yet. Don't open it yet. Don't open it yet. You've been at all the things.

All right, so here's what you got to do. Chug it. Chug it. Come on. Are you 18? Is legal age drinking age 18 here? Fuck! You're not? Oh, thank Jesus, god. That could have been bad.

And then throughout the panel, I'm going to tell you about the condition I've been having. Now, god knows I can't explain it, Tim. If I'm lying, I'm dying, everybody. For some reason today, the left nipple, very itchy. So I'm sick of itching it by myself. So now that we have everybody and our concubine, Joel, anytime I need it, I'm going to say, Joel, and I'm going to need you to come over here and scratch my nip. Just this one, not the right one.

No, I don't know about the Nasty Boys. Joel, at some point what I might need you to do is I'll lift my arm, and then I'll need you to come do the tag team move where you grab Tim's head and shove it in my armpit, because that's what the Nasty Boys used to do.

I want to do the first thing after getting a concubine and spilling stuff on him and really doing a shitty fucking Sandman entrance. I wanted to take a chance to thank you, Elon Musk, wherever you are, for everything you've given to us throughout the years. I wonder where the cameras are. They're everywhere. 360s. Are there any cameras coming from this way? No way. No? You look back, you see our Guardian just shaking. He's just shaking his head. That's a hard no. I'm going to do the I.M. Elon Musk thing because that would be a cool breakout, but I guess not. You could do it with your phone, couldn't you? Oh, you're right. You have a phone, right? Yeah.
