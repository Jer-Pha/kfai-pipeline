Austin More uh crowdfunding we had you know crowdfunding changed our company uh forever you hey crowdfunding changed I'm really thinking too much about the microphone really yeah you're too hung up on it now I'm just gonna put my mouth on it um you know when we first did it it just it it changed our relationship with our community forever like you guys have you know with your Patreon, Patreon you're kind of did you feel that like whereas before there was a little bit of a wall I feel like once you start getting involved in crowdfunding of any kind it just gets mixed up where they feel like they're making it happen a lot",

It's more like you're this actual community so that changed things for us forever in a positive way, super positive. Um, and you know we did a little differently on Psychonauts too because we did the Fig platform which has the investment part of it, so people actually get to do well if the game does well, get to share. That was our biggest concern there was all this news about how we made these millions of dollars and some people were like why'd you get all this free money and what if the game is a big hit, what happens to the people that helped you do it and they don't get anything and so I was like",

We have our own money, so we're putting in our own money, and then we have a publisher, 2K Games, coming in as publishing partners, so that it's more complicated to figure out the business negotiation stuff, but it really hasn't changed the production of the game at all. We're just like, you know, developing it the same way the team is. It's just that we have a different relationship with a publisher. Like, when a publisher gives you all the money, it affects things and changes a lot of stuff. They want to make sure you do a lot of risk mitigation things, and they want to have creative input and change things. And when you're asking for less money, you can kind of get away with doing a more creative signing project, you know what I mean? Like, after Brutal Legend, I was like, could we ever do another game that seems like asking for that much money again?",

Ah this guy knows what he's talking about, this guy knows but you can have what would be considered a niche audience still get What They Want, You know I want my game and they get what they want because they got organized and they well that was I remember your original point when you guys went to Kickstarter the first time was that you felt like there were no publishers who are going to give you money to go make an adventure game.

What will give me the most return?\" And that's probably when you have a choice between an adventure game and you know, like a first-person shooter. I think I'll make more money over here, and so that decision means no adventure games ever. But if you're looking at it from the other side, like how do I make an adventure game? Well, I can organize as many people who want it as still makes sense, sure. So they're back; they are back. How do you feel about what Telltale became?

Like, and they see... If you're looking through a fence and you see a little bit of it, you kind of imagine it to be much even bigger than it is. But if you show everybody, like, if I were to type it up and have it be in the game as a book you could read, I think that would just kill it, kill the magic of it. Yeah, but the free writing stuff, I'll never release at all because... Free writing is this thing that they do. Have you ever tried that? No, it's fun.

And and there if there's anything iconic about him like say the look of them that that just means that a bunch of other people got involved. I'm pulling out my phone cuz it's got some bootleg yeah it's not even something you really sell right I can't sell this don't don't tell them where I got that um but this like so many great artists come together to make those games and and sound designers and programmers and stuff so it's it's uh it's an honor how has that a lot of responsibility adjustment been for you. I feel like well you know back in the day when I won my game award, you know what I mean I gave that speech and it I know this sounds like I'm going to a joke but I'm really not no you're just like back remember that time I won the award before they trashed it up and gave it to Boogie Man.",

No, you're just like me, remember that time I won the award before they trashed it up and gave it to Greg Miller? Before when the award meant something. I love you, Greg. I'm joking, I'm joking around. But Kevin, Greg knows, uh, but when I gave that speech, that stemmed from the fact that I think it's kind of messed up right that like I'm well known for talking about video games, but the people who make video games by and large aren't known; they don't get stopped in the street like I do. For some or they just pass by in the Uncharted 4 Dev shirt at PSX, and people are more excited to meet me than them. They don't understand that's that relationship you've done that thing where you've crossed over, where I feel like, and Kickstarter is a big part of it, and how that all went with Double Fine. But the point where like when I see you walk a show floor, people stop and want to talk to you and know you, but you remember I when it was what.",

But I remember when it was what it was like on the other side right when you're making these games and no one knows you're involved, like I was like, \"What the hell's wrong with this? Start recognizing me! I'm here; I'm obviously hot stuff.\" Why isn't anyone telling me that? Has it been weird to adjust to though, that suddenly people like know you and they know that you made this? I think it's a lucky uh, I mean it's a it's a lucky level of because it's not like someone who's actually famous, say Brad Pitt. He's slightly more famous than me, or he's one credit short, but he can't... I don't know what it's like for actual really famous people; they can't really enjoy certain things. They can't like, I get to just be totally anonymous most of the time, but at an event like a GDC or E3 there's a collection of people who know who you are more.",
