What's that? I know, you know, you know what great comedy is all about - one timing. That's when the audio goes live, but you wait, you go three, 2, one, yeah. No, the audio, Nick, when I say three, two, one, when it happens, the audio's gone live, not the video. I'm not talking about the video at all. But why do you do this then? That's to tell you let you know the camera is actually on, yeah, exactly. I follow you. Here's my problem: not one of these dummies we were high-five and maybe that's our pregame ritual, maybe that's what we do before we go on camera. You don't know well just why if you waited half a second it would have had the high five on video, that's the problem. No one knows how long it takes you to turn it on, you got to flip, you flip 15 switches, you wait till the snap, till you click well then but",

Over at GameSpot, Eddie says Horizon Zero Dawn predicted to sell 8 million units, close to Uncharted for good gap. Sony's next big PlayStation 4 exclusive, Horizon Zero Dawn launches next week. Now a new report from SuperData claims the game, which is a brand-new franchise, may sell millions of copies this year and go on to become a hit on the level or close to Uncharted 4 and Metal Gear Solid 5. Horizon Zero Dawn will shift as many as many as 6 million copies by the end of 2017. SuperData set total sales could reach 8 million units, which would put it close to the most recent.",

In his report, Super Data CEO Dr. Serkan Toto cited Horizon Zero Dawn's strong review scores from critics as an element that could help boost sales. He added that Horizon Zero Dawn's release comes at a key moment for Sony, in part because hardware sales have started to slow down, leading to a greater reliance on software sales. So, take all that with a grain of salt; analysts are just like us, just looking at the numbers and making predictions. I do think Horizon's going to sell really well.
