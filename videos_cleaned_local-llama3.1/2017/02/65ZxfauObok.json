Now that one came from a question coming up later in the show - that's Jacob's Cabin 108, who called you? Of course it's a shout out to ECW Joel Gertner. But I want to put in there: how are you, Colin? I'm good, thanks. What's been going on? I haven't seen you in a long time. Just doing this and that - you know, little bit of this, a little bit of that. Yeah, just hanging out, and uh, you know, just being myself... being yourself or beating yourself? Well, I'm beating myself once, twice a day at least, but otherwise I'm being myself. How's that working for you? I mean, it's gotten me this far, I guess. Have you been to New Andronicos yet? No, New Andronico's is up and running. Yeah, how is it? I was too sick to go, but I had photos taken by Jen for me; she took some photos over there. It's old Andronico's except now they're pushing the Safeway card - they're saying you know",

But with so many people commending the game on its deep, engaging combat, impressive bosses, and leveling systems, there's one thing that keeps popping up in all these reviews, and is sometimes seen as a negative aspect of the game: that it's incredibly hard. Is that The Game's incredibly hard difficulty? I love a challenging game; Bloodborne is still my favorite PS4 exclusive, and Dark Souls 3 was my favorite game of last year, so I cannot wait to give Neo a shot. But even I have slightly been put off by some of the things I've read about the game.

And what I've been reading about with this first boss is that he's harder than almost all the other bosses in the game by the time you reach him. And uh, that he doesn't need all these hit points and there is an unpredictability in my experience fighting him where the first third of the fight is pretty easy. He has these two like Morning Star, like ball and chain kind of things, he's like whipping around and you kill him and then eventually you snap those and he uses the ball and then for the other two-thirds of the fight he runs around throws the balls all over the place throwing balls left and",

I think it's a positive step in the right direction. I think that the problems in the portfolio have way more to do with this dystopian obsession than anything else. That I think is going to backfire especially because the marquee game amongst those is the most important game they have, which is The Last of Us Part II.

I mean, Horizon Zero Dawn was reportedly greenlit maybe in 2011, so it's not like they had any idea that The Last of Us would be big, but The Last of Us was in development at that time. The bigger question to me is: does The Last of Us Part II really do well? Is it arguably the best PlayStation exclusive of all time, and then you have a game like Days Gone, which I'm very excited about, but is going to certainly draw comparisons to the game since it is a dystopian zombie-driven game, even though I know they're not similar.

Days Gone being so similar to it means that the only answer is that they're separated from each other.

I think a lot of games need more sex not less, more specifically they need more sex in the context of romantic relationships. Watch Dogs 2 was fun and I was dog 2 was fun but I felt no connection to the characters and I think a romantic subplot could have helped significantly. Consider how insane it is that Marcus, a young single man meets a cute girl hacker five minutes into the game then wakes up after a one night stand two minutes later and declines to pursue a relationship with either girl while that may seem pretty unrealistic to me the",

While that may seem pretty unrealistic to me, the real problem is that it passes up a golden opportunity to deepen the relationships between the characters. It might be able to forgive the game if it was aimed at younger boys who I presume still think girls have cooties or just didn't want to deal with sex and relationship issues, but the game also features random vaginas, a one night stand, a whole quest revolving around a webcam girl, and a special button to catcall or flirt with anyone on the street often with rather suggestive and unrealistic outcomes. I wouldn't suggest that sex or romance is required to tell a good story, but there's a reason most movies, books, shows have romantic subplots - they offer great insight into character.

As games develop more serious narratives, would you agree that developers should put more emphasis on romantic relationships rather than shy away from them? Thanks for your work, Phil. Then he says P.S. I've read the dev's explanation about Watch Dogs: \"We avoided having any romantic links for Aiden Pearce and Tatiana Marlowe because we didn't want the only main female character in DeadSec to have to justify her presence by having a romantic link with someone else.\" That makes sense, but there's an easier way this is",

I don't agree at all with you, Phil.

I thought for who Dead Sec were as a group and who Marcus was as a character - there's no point. Would I sit there?
