He recalled clearly something was wrong. They open the envelope and it says Emma Stone. Laa... so clearly something is not right. The guys in headsets were going around with urgency looking for the other envelope. It just kind of appeared, he said. One of the guys opens it and says Moonlight. And I took and I took it on stage and went to the microphone and said what I said, what Mr. Horowitz said; what Mr. Horwitz would have said: there's a mistake.
