Still one of my favorite catchphrases, good job guys, Greg. What have you been playing? Well, Nick, yes, Greg, I feel like not one, yeah, but both hands tied behind my back because I'm playing some games and they're embargoed so I can't talk about them at all. Okay, uh, what I can talk about is the stuff we played. Yeah, going to Australia, so that's why I brought in my Vita so I could run through my trophies. But where I'd want to start big?

That is going to be the let's play, I think, for us. All right, cool, everybody jumping and play by yourself and let's see or we break it into teams and go through and see you can do that and see you know who can be the best at saving all these kids but it was funny, it was fast, it's it's a one of those games that you get in and out of and I, I really feel like the more we play it the more other people play it you'll come up with the strategies you'll come up with the ideals you'll be there to you know actually have a strategy for.",

I mean, because what it is is you know usually how it works for Let's Plays: people hit me up, and then I look at their game and say if we'll do it or not or if we have time or whatever. And when I saw that a co-op puzzle game does is usually a no; we're not those kind of guys. But to jump in and actually watch the trailer see people dying \u2013 I could immediately see us messing with each other, which is immediately what happened. And then it became really quickly Kevin wanted to lead and be the general, and he's ordering things around, not understanding things, killing us all. What do you got for me? PS4, Xbox One, Steam.

It was the second day when we did the same thing with For The New Game, um, and it's essentially like you're these goats jumping up the uh mountain and you just kind of spin around. It's like a platformer, and whoever gets the top can drop bombs down below to **** up everybody else and they fall down, and you just got to get to the top and hold the top for a certain amount of seconds then you win it was utter chaos, it looked like a lot of fun, definitely sold on that one.

I have one Joy-Con, you have one Joy-Con; you put it down to your side. You wear a cowboy hat \u2013 if Nintendo PR people were there to give you a cowboy hat at home, we should all probably buy cowboy hats. I'm sure Nintendo will charge you $400 for it. You have to wear the cowboy hat, yes, of course. When we when we're going to do this Beat Cop let's play, do we have to dress as cops? 100% That was actually my stipulation; I said I would do this if we had dressed as cops, and you're like, \"And then you went even further,\" and you got fake mustaches.

Yeah, uh, Frame Two was coming up; he was showing Frame Two on the RTX Sydney show floor. I went over there and did an interview with him, screwed around with that a bit, then went and... when he had reached out and explained he was like, 'Hey, you know we're doing this blah blah.' I made Framed his game of the year; I want to say 2014 it was\u2014it was not this last year, but whatever. He said this is his favorite game. I was like, 'Awesome,' so I bought it and then I played Frame Two a little bit there. I was like, 'This is cool.'

I guess it's like your detective noir black silhouettes running through, and so you'll get a scene of something playing out, and then like the you know the character will run out of a frame into the next frame, and you can move the rest of the frames basically. Usually what happens is Framed one is anchored, and Framed the last frame is anchored, and then there's other frames there that you then move around to make it happen. And so what is this called Framed? Oh cool.
