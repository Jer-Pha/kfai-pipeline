Um, I'll be filling questions today from uh Patreon.com/KindaFunny, our main Patreon. Uh, Tim Gettys is doing the Kinda Funny Games, which is good because I don't know much about games. Let's get right into it. This question comes from John Bx32. Says, \"All right, Nick, let's set the stage. Let's say the last DC movie comes out in 2019 and completely fails. Hypothetical, but okay, let's go with that. Uh, you put you're in charge of the reboot of rebooting the DCU. How long do you wait? What would your first two to three movies be? And most importantly, who is your Batman? Well, I think you answered yourself question there. Uh, my first three movies would just be Batman movies because let's be perfectly honest, those are the only movies that are going to do well. Okay. My Batman Ryan Gosling. I'll go with",

Who would your Batman be? I don't know. I haven't thought about it. But like Ryan Gosling, that's Christian Bale. Let's get Christian Bale back to be Christian Bale did it. He's done. We don't need Christian Bale back anymore. Okay. You can go off to American Psycho 2 for all I care. That's all I'm saying. Uh, as to who would direct the Batman series though, I guess in this hypothetical, I'd be directing the Batman series. So, yeah, it would be Ryan Gosling just so I could hang out with him.

I did not see The Angry Birds Movie uh because I'm not a three-year-old. Uh I did play a lot of Angry Birds when it came out back in the day.

But then I realized it was all set up for what I would say is probably one of the best seasons of television ever made. Um, if you haven't watched it, you don't have HBO, do yourself the service. Buy it somewhere. I'm sure you can get the whole season somewhere. Um, it's really, really cool and it's a very unique show. Um, and it has lots of nudity in it. So, if you don't like deep sci-fi and deep cuts when it comes to that, you can see a lot of dicks and a lot of uh boobs and some uh some pubic hair. So, you know, take that for what it's worth.

We use the HyperDeck recorders and the ATEM 2ME broadcast studio, but they sell a smaller one that might be better. It's relatively affordable. So, to get more camera angles in, we use a video switcher. Uh, we use the Blackmagic Design ATEM 2, which is a broadcast version. It's very big. It has a lot of inputs. Um, you don't or the 2ME.

You can take one to your to your deck to actually hit record on it and then you have to have someone like Kevin sit there and go they also live himself in the TV the TV studio which I think is less and like accepts HDMI.

When are huge directors?\" When are a huge director, excuse me, I believe he said, \"When you are a huge director, will you ever make a good one?\" Um, I think the reason why a lot of video game movies don't work is because there's a lot of chefs in the kitchen. And in order to make a good movie, not even one based on a prior property, you have to have someone at the top that has a good creative vision and has a team of people that can support that creative vision and is given the sort of room and the space to breathe and let that vision come to fruition.

Um, and so I think a lot of the reasons why the video game movies fail is because I I don't Well, I mean there's probably a myriad of reasons, but I have to imagine it's because there's a lot of stakeholders that want to see that they have a lot of, you know, a lot at stake in the projects.

Um, so I don't think it's not beyond a shadow of doubt or a shadow of belief that someone could make a good video game movie. I just think it's just it just comes down to priorities, right? Often times it's just about like furthering the name of the series than it is more about that than it is about actually making a quality film. Um, because as we all know, success and quality don't necessarily have to be intermingling together for something to be to make money. You know, we've all seen the last three Transformers movies.

Lots of good episodes like I can't really think of one specifically right now because that's just kind of Psych in general, but but yeah, I'd have to I'd have to think hard on that one. Um, Amy Gill says, \"Nick, if you could star in any movie since the 80s, what would it be and why?\" Uh, I always wanted to be Batman, so it would have been the 1989 Batman. Would have been the worst movie ever made cuz I was very chubby at 9 years old. I would have looked really weird in the suit, but that would have been it. Um, and last question for today for this AMA is coming from Tyson Williams. He says, \"If there was a theme park for all of cinema history, what would you put in that park?\" A theme park for all of cinema history, what would you put in that park? I mean, oh jeez, I don't know. Um, you'd have to have some sort of, I would imagine, themed ride for every",

Um, you'd have to have some sort of, I would imagine, themed ride for every single cool movie. So, you have to have a Harry Potter ride, a Jurassic World ride, a Raiders of the Lost Ark ride, um, a Star Wars ride, a Marvel ride. Pretty much it would just be Disneyland, I guess, at this point, if I'm being 100% honest. But then of course I would want the only thing I would ask is that there actually be an amazing movie theater that has like that projects old prints of old movies on with an actual projector that aren't digital. I think that'd be really really cool cuz when you see a movie like Interstellar and you forget what it looks like to actually see something projected on film. Um, it's it's a pretty special thing and a lot of people are like oh wait Star Wars was shot on film and all these things were shot on film. They were but seeing something actually",

They were but seeing something actually projected on film is something that's very very rare because I could be wrong about this. I I I never looked it up, but I'm pretty sure when you go see Star Wars, it's still a digital projector. Even though they acquired the actual image on film, that image was digitized and moved over to um to basically just be ones and zeros after that. Yeah, maybe they'll go back to film for the for the final print to show and to and to project, but at a certain point, you're already doing a digital intermediate. And so, you know, you've uh you've just you've lost a little bit of the magic of actually that projecting. Cuz when I was a kid, you used to actually go in and you'd see the burn marks. You'd see all the scratches and hairs on the film. You'd hear the projector, which was always awesome because",
