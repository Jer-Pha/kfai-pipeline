Uh, recently I just finished Inside, I played Journey, and now I'm playing Hitman. So you finally did big jump, yeah, yeah. I don't know why I think I I just I've I've always liked Hitman as a series. Um, traditionally I've played that game the complete polar opposite of how you're supposed to play it. I think the last time I played was either Hitman 2 or Hitman: Blood Money, I think it was Hitman 2, which I think was on PS2.

But I'm digging it. If you guys haven't played it, you should give it a chance. It's a... it's a like if if you like Hitman, if you're a fan of the series, this is like the best. Here's the thing though: is I don't know what's been interesting about Hitman is that everybody who sees it and goes \"oh, that looks interesting\" and plays it seems to fall in love with it. And there's you, of course, but you said if you're a fan of the series... I'm thinking Steve Burton, who played it loved it, talks about it all the time.

You're like, \"I'm going to kill this guy with a cocktail.\" That's pretty fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Spoilers: you don't kill him with a cocktail; he gets sick, and then you drown him in the toilet. You come up, and he drinks it, and you just bash the glass, take the corkscrew, jab it in his jugular. Yeah, so we do always talk about games as a platform and kind of embracing that. But I think when this game was first announced, and like I remember when I played a demo of it at one of the events, I was kind of uh, I went into it with some preconceived thoughts of like, \"Oh, because this is being released episodically, it's less than\" - like I kind of went into it imagining that it wasn't as important as a true Hitman game would be.

Well, that was the thing with Giant Bomb, and I'm pretty sure I'm right on this because Hitman keeps coming up. This is the thing where episodic is so fascinating in the way that when we talk about video games, right, and we're talking about AAA games, whatever, we're talking about how Watch Dogs is this outlier right now that's charting even though it's been out months - that's bizarre. You know what I mean? Episodic is such a great idea in the way that you are constantly part of the conversation. You know, Walking Dead season 3; we were just talking about today in the morning show.
