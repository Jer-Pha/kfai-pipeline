Every once in a while I'd get back in when I want some really intellectual stirring conversation, then I come back to you guys and thank you. We just talk about whatever. What's the next one? Kim Chi, good topic actually. We'll get to it, but they had a great episode that one of the other they called \"lose-lose\" and they were talking if you haven't heard this please go over looked for this one we're going to gloss over the topic but I want to set this up for you guys the topic was about the 2012 Olympic badminton game, badminton game excuse me which I finally figured out.",

The topic was about the 2012 Olympic badminton game, Badminton - excuse me, which I finally, for the first time in my entire life, learned how to pronounce that. There's an extra \"n\" and there's no way I didn't know that badminton. That this particular round took place between a Korean team and a Chinese team. Now, the cost was they both teams had made it into the finals; they did not win, need to win this game. In fact, it behooves them to lose this game because the winner of the game would go on to play a much harder Chinese team, while the loser of the game would go and play a much easier team - I think was a Dutch team, I can't remember the specifics. So they started subtly at first tanking the game; both sides not realizing that the other side was doing the exact same thing. Right, and so you see him we'd see with it a little bit here and there go I go that's what would hit and we just go directly to",

Awesome, you can watch us online by the way, you can go to YouTube and watch those clips of it, and it's hilarious because these are Olympic level athletes, so when I hate him badminton athletes but still, I mean top in their sport. Oh, I wasn't it wasn't like an odd spill be like you know like these people are Olympic level Alex they want to do something they do it they want to win and so it because it begs the question and ultimately what happens to these people",

So they try to make it look like they're there doing it, but ultimately, it's well, down to both sides getting disqualified, that's awful. So it brings up a very interesting ethical question: when is it okay to lose if you are a professional athlete whose sole purpose is to win? That's the question, and in this case, do you think they were wrong or do you think they were right because they were trying to show you like the metagame; they're playing a game, and then they start playing the",

But why wasn't it acceptable here in this specific instance, trying to win that game for the most part? Your third string comes in, your third-string quarterback shows up, but if you lose that game, you're not going to be devastated, right? It doesn't share, share, share, any other it's complicated, this is a very complex issue. That's what we call them out of the box, the super complicated issues. Because you see this in professional sports, releasing in the United States and I assume you see it overseas as well. And the leagues have taken some steps to stop people from tanking because especially in basketball teams were actually actively starting to tank in order to get good draft picks because you know the draft is so limited in the NBA, the talent is so high in the NBA.",

And so like that where there's too many players on the roster, so now I'm not saying a great player in hockey doesn't make a team better what I'm saying is you roll with 22 players to the hockey game, you know there are literally 22 players on your roster so and they're all going to play. So in basketball you have a bench with you have like 13 players over but in half this we're never going to see it and LeBron James on your team is gonna make a huge difference more than a Wayne Gretzky level player on your hockey team, sure.

In 2009, the Jets were seven and seven, and they had to win out to make the playoffs as a wild-card team there and play the Colts in the 15th game of 16 games. The Colts were 14-1 and had already clinched the division and a bye week and home-field advantage; they didn't need to win anymore, and they didn't care. Some teams have a pride thing, but he wanted to go 16-0, but the Colts just didn't really care. They wanted to protect Peyton Manning, they want to protect their team, so they started Curtis Painter, who's a terrible quarterback, and like all their backups against the Jets, but just destroyed them. The Jets' starters are way better than the Colts' second string, and so suddenly the Jets are eight and seven, and everyone's like this is crazy, including the teen teams that were also in the race, being like we had to play the Chargers' starters, you got to play.",

It's crazy, because a team that was really good will get the worst of the best players available, you know, and the team that was the worst will get the best of the best players available in order to create parity. And the NBA was looking at this - the 76ers had recently done several years for instance, and they instituted a lottery saying like if you finish in the last place, you have a twenty-five percent chance of getting the first pick. There's no way we can keep doing this over and over again, and so in the NHL, and if the Oilers who have been bad for a really long time got I think something like four first picks in a row because the lottery just gave them even though they didn't necessarily pick less, and they have this amazing stocked team now based on this random math to stop people from tanking.",

Yeah, I don't think it was up to them apparently and the radio, a lot of people supposed to do better but they were like you, they were looking over the coach because she's like, \"Don't do it out,\" I gotta stick with the plan basically 'cause it's our strategy and it was a good strategy right?
