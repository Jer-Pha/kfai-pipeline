You're so wrong, Nick, you're that's why you make the worst purchases ever, and it's so infuriating. No, so I mean the like the majority of the time 1-star reviews are just like oh man, I liked the product, but the shipping was horrible, and like this thing **** up. It's never really about or it's about just the person inability to to cope with life and what was happening at the time. And there's sometimes where like yeah, the thing just totally didn't work, but I just think that more often than not 1-star reviews are not valid. 5-star reviews are pretty much the same thing, where it's like I mean if all of the reviews are 5s, that's a really good sign, but I like to stay more in the 3-star range.",

Well, Amazon Instant is great 'cause I have skin in the game, Amazon Instant, I'm talking about renting the new movies right. Oh interesting, okay so you got Go the whole time then exactly. So whereas Netflix is the complete opposite, Netflix, if it's got two stars or one and a half stars like that's a **** movie usually but I'll do it, I'll do it like all right you know whatever Anna Faris is in this, I'll I'll give it a shot, I jump in there, I'm like Anna Faris, that's just what I such a crush on, movie pull it out of the blue on that one but you jump in and like no if you don't hook me and this looks",

I only go to four documentaries and standup specials or like The West Wing, if Young Justice run, oh yeah, The West Wing, so where it's like that's great but like if I'm taking a shot, I'm taking a shot on Amazon just because I think I feel like I have to commit, I I have to do my research. Another thing with Amazon too is the Prime thing, I think Prime gives me an automatic like I trust you more, yeah, like and I I think that as you know time goes on, the third-party sellers are a little bit more trustworthy but still at the end of the day if Prime was an option even if the Prime cost $2 more I trust it more okay sorry you're talking about product products now right yeah cuz Prime video is a thing too no no no yeah no no Prime",

So I kind of take that rationale to Amazon and other places where I don't really deal with the unless there's like a precipitous, like two and a half star rating in which 500 people have given it you know something that nets there on Amazon. I'm not really wary of that. The Q&A section is very useful. Uh, I also just buy what I want anyway, so like it's like I don't need your review on the uh the six-pack of Crest toothpaste; I'm just going to buy that right? You know you've proven to yourself that Crest is is the brand of choice. So uh yeah, so to me it's like I'm always wary and and I don't really believe anyone what anyone says at any given time.

So it goes back to that as well, like the last time I bought a product that I wasn't familiar with was I bought a scale so I can obsess over my weight, that was a really smart decision and uh it was a scale that is this very cheap but mass-market scale that I bought on Amazon that was reviewed thousands of times and had a 4.6 or something and I'm like okay it weighs things yeah like we know that it's okay and that's I have no idea if it's right or not, it's telling me that I'm way fatter than I should be so right and then I you know definitely don't obsess over it, so uh yeah but I don't often just go on there and just buy will, I'm not I guess what I'm saying is I don't buy big items where I'm worried about it.",

You can go to a restaurant and you can see the elite users who have done it, like Gad, who works at GameSpot used to work with us at IGN, is like super **** Yelp guy. And you go in and like I'll go to random San Francisco restaurants to see on Yelp to see if they're good, and the top review will be from him, and that's a thing. It's also the thing where people share photos and they overshare information, so if it is the food was great or I didn't like this or you know this isn't how this works for like I feel like Yelp, the community that actually reviews on Yelp, is really into it.
