Yeah, it's a little weird; it is overpowering. And I'm like, \"Where are the Mountain Bars?\" Who's eating the Mountain Bars? No, it's coconut and the coffee. Yeah, but... yeah, there you might be able to see a little bit of it. Can you careful? It's hot. Um, no, you can't really make it out. So uh, you have to be careful with the coconut.",

Greg will do his best in the interview, I'm sure it won't be nearly as good as the episode that we had; episode great, we were all firing on all cylinders and it was a fantastic and fascinating conversation that you will literally never see. But we're trying to make it up so Greg's doing a one-on-one with Pete Hines. I feel like you just can't hear it - you could look at it, yeah, you could look at the whole thing. I was thinking we could do that: we could just play the footage and then me and Pete talk about what we think we were talking about at this point.

We recorded that on Tuesday and then by the end of the week everything was on fire and he, the immigration thing had happened, the executive order people were freaking out and then it's like every day you wake up and look at the news and something else crazy has happened and people are getting fired Sean Spicer saying all sorts of crazy stuff tweeting his passwords maybe nobody knows what's happening you got banned over there people call him president it's just like Jesus Christ what the hell is happening anymore.",

What I think he's really doing is I think he's smartly um uh just absolutely pandering to his base; he's he's all those people that got elected; he's saying look, I'm doing all these things that you want me to do, whether or not they're lasting, I don't think he cares. I don't think there's anything that strengthens the result. Hey, I remember all those things I said, I actually went and did those.

Um, I don't have the information to even come close to starting to begin to understand that. Um, but it is, it seems it does seem scarier than it was when say like Bush took over right? And what's crazy about that is you look at the things that Bush did. Um, let's take the immigrant ban for a second right. You look at the countries that everyone I'm sure saw the chart that came out that said all seven of the countries that that people are banned from coming aren't countries that Trump does business in um but then you know Saudi Arabia UAE all these other countries that he has hotels or something, country excuse me, that he has hotels in um aren't banned right even though they're prominent there.",

Um, and so that's Insidious, right, and that makes you scared and that makes you think well you know maybe we do need to see this guy's tax returns because maybe there's some outrageous stuff happening there. And then you think back to the days before social media when we decided to start a war in Iraq to go get weapons of mass destruction that weren't there, and then but but I don't remember people being that outraged about that back then.

I don't know what that would have looked like, um, but I do know that this, whatever we're doing right now is not working; all it's doing is serving to strengthen this one person at the top, who's now has more power than any president in the United States has ever had in the history of our country. Um, and meanwhile, while he's doing whatever the **** he wants up top, all the rest of us are just crying about it over on this little silo that's called Twitter or over on Facebook, and it's not; I don't feel like it's actually doing anything. I mean, I would argue that it is; it's better than not doing anything at all. I feel like that stuff is causing protests, that stuff is causing so many",

What is actually doing something like sitting here talking about oh man I'm so sick of seeing these tweets it's like well we're literally just doing it, it never ends where it's just constant like putting the focus on well you're doing something wrong you're not doing something right but we're still not coming up with any solution and like that's the thing is I would not even know where to start with coming up with a solution but I do think that anytime we're talking about it it's at least getting somewhere because it's.",
