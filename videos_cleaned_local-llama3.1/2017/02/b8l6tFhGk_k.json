The information can be found on Nintendo's Japanese website and while the majority of the games will fit comfortably on the Switch's 32 GB of internal memory, Dragon Quest Heroes I and II will require a separate SD card. This is because it weighs in at a hefty 32 GBs and given that some of the Switch's internal memory will be allotted to the operating system, extra space is needed. Nintendo's website advises a micro SD card of 32 GB or more is required separately.

Publisher Bandai Namco has announced that the previously announced PlayStation Vita version has been cancelled. However, while there is no word on the PS3 version we reported on last year, Chroma Squad sees players take control of a team comprised of five stunt actors who have quit their day jobs to create their own Power Rangers-esque television show. You'll have to purchase and upgrade equipment, craft weapons, and build giant mechs to engage in battles against monsters all for the goal of achieving high TV viewer ratings.
