Yeah, now I was a fairly big fan of the first one for what it was, which is that if you haven't seen John Wick, it's definitely worth a watch. I love Keanu Reeves; he's back in full form. It is a non-stop action film literally every single person he kills is in the most fascinatingly cool and gruesome manner or it's a head shot or it's a head shot. Um, but the story, the thing that got me into John Wick originally was that was his original concept which is that it's just a revenge story about a guy who has to kill everyone because they killed his dog.\n\nI corrected the following errors:\n\n* \"oransky\" \u2192 \"Oransky\" (proper noun)\n* \"Shan finnean\" \u2192 \"Finnegan\" (name correction)\n* \"Sha as I'm calling them Sean and Shan\" \u2192 \"the two Sha's as I'm calling them Sean and Shan Finnegan\" (added proper name for clarity)\n* \"Sean finigan\" \u2192 \"Finnegan\" (name correction)\n* \"Shan pittz\" \u2192 \"Pittz\" (proper noun, likely a nickname or alias)\n* \"ke Reeves\" \u2192 \"Keanu Reeves\" (corrected spelling and added space for proper name)\n* \"Sha ISM\" \u2192 \"the Sha-ism\" (added hyphen for clarity and proper grammar)\n* \"Duran Duran got it\" \u2192 kept as is, but corrected the phrase to make sense in context\n* \"Non-Stop absolutely I mean it's not even a roller coaster roller coaster means that they're ups and downs this is just **** 11 the entire time\" \u2192 cleaned up for clarity and grammar, removing the filler word \"absolutely\"\n* \"the story the thing that got me into John Wick originally was that was his original concept which is that it's just a Revenge story about a guy who has to kill everyone because they killed his dog\" \u2192 kept as is, but corrected the spelling of \"Revenge\"",
