And for me, you know I I told the kids the day of that I needed to take some time, I need to think about it. I wanted to hear their thoughts and opinions, and I was surprised how many people said no, keep it going, keep it going. And what the theme that kept coming up with it was, it's not it's not just a show built on you and Colin; it is the it is the spiritual successor to Beyond, 'cause we just ripped off Podcast Beyond. So when I got that framing around it, and then when I thought about what I want to do next in terms of video game podcasting and stuff like that, it made sense for me to reach out to you to have you come in to do one final show. So we put a pin in this so PS I Love You XOXO just doesn't abruptly end on everybody's feeds and nobody knows why because I got I was surprised how many people didn't know Colin had left and didn't know all the",

Though before the show started, you were telling me about what you have planned, yeah, uh, and I think that's going to be really cool. So I'm sure once you tell everyone else about it, they'll they'll be pretty psyched.

And not that those would have been no offense to them, my picks or something like that. That no matter what whoever I would have put in that seat to continue doing the show would have gotten the **** kicked out of them in comments over and over again on Twitter, it always would have been compared, it's the same thing Max and Brian have had to deal with since we left, beyond the fact oh this show isn't as good as it used to be blah blah blah.

At least it feels familiar, and you didn't feel like it was so different that uh you had to learn something new, and it threw you off. That's always good, I think. People forget that it's always good that it feels the same and doesn't feel vastly different, which uh I've I've experienced a few times with sequels I was really looking forward to that changed too much y uh just for the sake of doing it. Um so I I think that if it feels like Destiny and it has a lot of these new a ton of new features from everything I've read they're adding a ton, that is definitely a good start for them.
