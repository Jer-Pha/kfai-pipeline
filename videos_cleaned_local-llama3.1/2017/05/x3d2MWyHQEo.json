Like I could play it on Vita, I saw them, I got the Platinum in that. I could go chip away at that but is this one better? And but then it was just whole thing of like well what about replaying games in general and not even Minecraft - granted every world can be a different experience but what about like I'm like I can't wait for Super Mario World whenever they get that on the eShop for Switch. Like I've played that a million times, I've bought it many times, I think every time I buy it I probably play less and less. I just like having it and it's the same thing like PaRappa the Rapper - he's here and Little Big Planet goes out this week and what that means Patapon me I'd be commenting which is a different story because we'll play the **** out of Hatoful Boyfriend",

I was like, how did you not accidentally create any time to hear any different dialogue or do something bad? Say, hey, you know your favorite game of all time - you've played it twenty-nine times. One slide, you can plan a little bit differently than an external... it yeah, when the journey Wanderers naked this time, oh yeah, yeah. The rigor mortis, yeah. Um, and so like in my mind, especially longer games, I don't really play that being said there are probably ten games I replay on a yearly basis. Really, Journey is probably the most recent one, okay. Uh, but a lot of mostly Super Nintendo games you mentioned - Mario World, it's Super Mario World, The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, Super Metroid, Earthbound, Chrono Trigger - like these are games I go back to literally annually, really.

I don't think I don't I feel like I don't say games peaked there but my personal taste in games not just peaked there - like I I don't think there will ever be a better Mario, Zelda, or Metroid game than those three as much as I love Breath of the Wild; she gets like a genre-defying game. Um, so I go back to there it's comfort food, it's knowing exactly what to do. I go back and play Banjo-Kazooie because it is it's muscle memory - like we played through all of Banjo Kazooie a year and a half ago on Christmas it was me Andrew and Alana and we played through the entire thing and got 100% and didn't need a guide, it was just like I remember doing this.

I remember this one, it's the best thing is like, cuz, yeah, it gets progressively the levels get less and less interesting in Mario, suited for but that's story-related, anyway. On but I think the games besides that because those are kind of just played through them, the games I go back to play the most are things that don't really have a story or narrative at all, so Amplitude, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, sure, like I love just going back and skating around for 15 minutes.

I don't always make the comment that you know it if it had a platinum, I would have it talking about back in the day - sure. Because I mean I played that thing non-stop and there was a moment where because I wanted all the dog tags, I want to know the ghost pictures, wanted all stuff and I remember playing freshman year college she's playing it over and over and over again getting everything and then getting furious when my years later my other college roommate borrowed it and came back with a different memory card in it - **** where's that never started and you kind of find them all of it was gone but it's like I never needed it again but I wanted it kind of thing while",

You don't like re-watching movies, no, I used to as a kid watching them in real time, it's like now it's fun to go back, you know?
