So I was in a band in the 1990s, um, but before I had this real job of being a voice actor, I had a real job of being in a band. What band? Um, it was called Dance Hall Crashers; that's my band. Many TR made records, oh so trumpet players we had at one point in the late 80s, I think we had two at most, one uh, a guy Jeremy Goodwin who's still awesome and has a studio in Piedmont, um, still friends with but over time we lost the horns and were more of just like a punk ska band 'cause we had two female singers and guitars and we felt that there was enough melody going on with plus like Scott Weiland back in the 80s especially late 80s it was like skinhead city so it'd be like periodically",

Okay, and there was some crazy like some of those shows were riots and windows broken pry, so we were more you know comfortable doing punk rock shows sure. But yeah, no I was in a band and we played. You're saying Sublime shows were more hardcore than punk rock shows? Oh yeah, 'cause much higher Scott was always the kind of like \"yo, we're in No Doubt, you know?\" We served... oh no, this was like the second wave stuff so it was you know tail end of that into like...

Like The Dark Crystal was terrifying; it's still scary today. Another one I think a lot of people have heard of but have never seen is Labyrinth. I have to go back and watch it again. Labyrinth is like, you know, Jennifer Connelly and then there was also Legend starring Tom Cruise. Remember that one? I swear, I love that movie; it held up great.

I've slapped him; he does a split real good every time. With Van Damme splits, he did Bloodsport. He was one of three guys amazing. Based on a True Story by the way, Frank Dux was the real character. The real person who went to Hong Kong to fight in this underground, like bare-knuckle fight called The Bloodsport. It was like people would bet on it and stuff so he was an American Soldier they decided to go do that being chased by the Army because they want him back cuz he's Frank Dux and he just does the splits on chairs for no reason and it's great then he did Kickboxer and you were like, that's pretty much the same movie.
