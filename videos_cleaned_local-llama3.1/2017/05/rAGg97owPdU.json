Now they're both going back there and it seems to have struck a chord with the audience. What I mean is that Battlefield 1 went back to World War I instead of going forward in time like Call of Duty, which has fatigue amongst its audience. But like I said, gamers in general are hordes of the future. There were like how many games in a row or four doing like a new one?

But like I think they're really focused on making this the best possible experience for PC enthusiasts because this is a game that should have, and arguably was made for that platform in the first place. And the fact that it's an FPS is uncapped, and then there's people taking screenshots from the event of like the aesthetic, like the graphics settings and stuff, and seeing that you can go with, you know, the standard stuff like foliage and motion blur and all that you can you can adjust everything.

Yeah, do you think launching with one raid is enough? Yeah, 100%! Yeah, they got to remember, there's also gonna be like a brand new campaign, brand new cinematic campaign. And one of the other big features was they announced four new zones - four new major zones. Right, we have The Tower, we have Nessus, we have Io which are planetoid flash planets or moons in our solar system.

Yeah, like there was an expectation that it'd be open-world, and it wasn't quite open-world, and that was one of the complaints that was levied against the game at its launch, which stands to this day. If the European Dead Zone is as big and explorable as they're making it seem like it is, this is going to be a huge amount of content: so many activities and quests and NPCs and enemies to go out and conquer. Between that and the campaign \u2013 I'm sorry, campaign \u2013 between that and the raid, I think one raid is enough, considering how complex the raids are.
