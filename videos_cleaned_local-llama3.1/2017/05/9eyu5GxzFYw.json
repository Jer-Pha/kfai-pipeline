Not the least of which is because they were constantly thinking about ways to expand and reinvent the brand, and one of the things that Hugh Hefner was really good at was emerging media and figuring out how to get on those platforms, especially TV.

Today, he notes our hard-won victories are in peril, taking a hard swipe at President Donald Trump. He calls for a counter to the rise of neo-conservatism and quote politicians who seem uh comfortable jeopardizing the rights of specific groups in the belief that it will make America great again.

I'll read this to be forewarned: Playboy has brought back nudity, but it's not even close to graphic; the nude feature, uh, the photo, the nude photos feature breasts, Jesus Christ, and apparently workout videos. The new photos feature breasts and bums, that's it; no one's going to confuse this publication with Penthouse or Hustler. Playboy and Co., no, if readers want something more explicit they know exactly where they can find it on the internet, um, as a consequence Cooper's business strategy with his Playboy is that he's trying, he isn't trying to compete, he's aiming to own a very specific space one his father's created with a cool mix of politics, sex, and an anti-establishment attitude, um, it goes on from there but",
