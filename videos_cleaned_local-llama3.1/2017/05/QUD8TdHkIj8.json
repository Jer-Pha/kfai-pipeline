You know, there was that period where if you started wearing one, you're like, \"Oh, that's really cool.\" And then I don't remember that period now. There was a time when you saw one or two people with a man bun, and you're like, \"Oh, that's pretty cool.\" And then two or three months later, everyone jumped on the bandwagon. Darren jumped on it four months after that, but then a month later, let it go.
