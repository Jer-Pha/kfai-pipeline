Yeah, Daddy anything \u2013 he's just into it. Uh, he wishes he could've been here; so does Greg, but they're off celebrating other things. And Nick, I hope is okay somewhere; I have no idea, but it was weird because I'm looking at him and thinking the best thing to do is not say anything, just let him do his thing, you know? And he was just writhing in pain; I asked if you want to help up, and he said, \"I feel way less in pain in this position than I do sitting down or standing up.\" Yeah, so someone's really hurt.
