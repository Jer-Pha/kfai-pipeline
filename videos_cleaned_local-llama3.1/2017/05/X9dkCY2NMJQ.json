Yeah, I really don't like the word \"twang.\" No, I don't either. But that's how that's... I got to respect the culture. So that's what Andy does is he takes the the the pickle twang and he takes a bag of Hot Cheetos puts it all in there and shakes that **** up. Andy's an interesting creature. He really is. What's interesting about him is you look at him and you'd imagine he's somewhat healthy, I mean you think he has it somewhat together - look like he has a **** together 'cause he works out a little bit but he just trash you know I mean he trash the outside dead on the inside yeah exactly exactly yeah I",

Where I'm like, \"Ah, it just feels like they just put this out just to put it out.\" And I'm like, \"It's not bad; it's just not nearly as good as the other two or four, depending on how you want to talk about them.\" Um, so I don't know. But there was a cool feature where one of the main characters has an ability called her turn wheel, where you can kind of rewind time a bit. So if a character dies, you can make that not happen, and it's part of the gameplay. So it's not like turning off permadeath; they have casual mode, no one does that. I like that in games like Republia Play had that, uh, Disney Afternoon collection had that, where it's like, \"Hey, these games are tough as piss, like Battletoads.\"",

However, there is a VR game called \"Kroma\" in development) uh oh not PSVR sorry it's only on Oculus I really wish it was on PSVR do you think this one will do well because this is the conversation we had where I was like they announced this and on the morning show I was like well here you go it's your Mirror's Edge Catalyst it's it's the other games you it's the games that the vocal minority like to their point you're a fan of it I get it you want it you want it you want it and then it comes out and it just doesn't do perform I don't know like I part of me is like yeah I don't know if it will perform but that being said if I just look at analytics like each one of the videos",

Like, they crushed immediately. In a way, most random trailers or gameplay drops are it's interesting. One of like... what was the other one I had a better example than Mir's Edge? Because Mirror's Edge Catalyst wasn't good, or whatever. But I understand the hype. Yeah, there was another one too that doesn't matter. And Evil is one of those games that whenever it comes out - if it does come out - it can never live up to the hype. Yeah, and it's... yeah, I don't know.
