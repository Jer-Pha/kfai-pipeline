If you're unfamiliar with judges week, it's that Geoff Keighley assembles the Super Friends of video game publications and invites them there to see games early.

Okay, um I think I think we're in an interesting situation right now because all of the AAA kind of stuff that we've seen out come out so far, the vast majority of it has been funded or at least subsidized by either Sony or Oculus uh I think when that money stops happening if that money stops happening before the market is big enough to support those kinds of games that's a kind of real dangerous inflection point right because if",
