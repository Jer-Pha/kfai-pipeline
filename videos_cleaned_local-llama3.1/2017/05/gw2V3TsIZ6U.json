Shawn Levy is directing a film that will take its inspiration from a sequence in the third iteration of the video game that focused on the young Thief Nathan Drake and his first encounter with the professional Rogue Elena Fisher. This reformulation of the franchise was an inspiration of Sony Pictures Chief Tom Rothman after seeing the latest cut of the Spider-Man film.

Yeah, um, so wait, Joe Carnahan's not writing the script anymore, apparently not. Oh, I thought he was still attached to writing the script, not according to Deadline - they have the exclusive here. They're looking for a new one, so IMDb needs to update their info. Sons of Anarchy. Um, what do we think, everybody? This has been... what do you think about this? Yeah, that's what I wanted.

I feel like Tom Holland; he's he's not he doesn't look super young so, so you're saying for a prequel it's too Tom Holland is too old. Yeah, yeah, no, no, I mean he's playing at high school right now as Peter Parker. Yeah, but even like that's not going to last; you know he won't be able to play a high school student or next time the movie comes around he looks very young; he's got young skin.

My my my argument, you know when they were like Mark Wahlberg whoever you're going to put in that role is the fact that it's not going to be Nathan Drake other than that we love so much we've seen that character created and solidified and now you know we've seen the journey end for that everything that character.
