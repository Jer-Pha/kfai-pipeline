I mean, that's the thing you think that's the after the last season you're talking about, you're talking about the show. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see. I think the show will keep going in perpetuity. I don't know, I mean I think the last season was awful personally. I think the show should have ended sooner than planned, nothing happens but also I think that they would have wanted it to go on like 15 or so seasons, but I think I think it'll end at 10.

Next season will be all-out war, and then they'll the finale will have a definitive moment, then there'll be a blackout, then we'll come back and we'll pick up with what happens next, and that'll be the thing where in to the general audience they're going to be like \"what the ****\" and then I think you're going to have that renewed spark of interest that everybody's super into it cuz that's how it's been.

I will, I'm sure at some point, just to like catch up. But uh, I'm thinking more just overall broadly: we know the story; we know that no matter whether it's a video game, TV show, or comic book, there is this world that exists, and there are the rules of the world. And at some point, the main storyline will come to an end. I think Rick will die, and that will not be the end. I think that'll then allow Carl to...older.

But that's the thing of like the comic. I feel like I want him to pair it back. I like cuz I my favorite you know in the comic was like when uh we were in there, everything's great, you know? Prison life's happening and then we got ripped out of that and it was just uh Carl and Rick for a while and I was like that's awesome. I'd like to get back to that cuz that's the whole thing.

Where it's like oh that's really cool, The all to do that was it Dallas was that the original show people didn't I don't remember them liking it too much when that happened though didn't go that was not well received. The only cool about it is like it the whole thing started with him getting shot and put in the that's true so it's like that would be one big mind but it's like that is there's so much that happened where it's like that's a weird ass coma you went through, that's possible I mean that that's my thing.

Um I yeah my thing is I I know that it's counterintuitive to what the show is but I do want some level of closure with it and whether that means hey we've we've closed out Rick's storyline we've closed out the the original cast storyline like I would like to see Maggie keep going, I don't know if she's alive in the comic books or not.
