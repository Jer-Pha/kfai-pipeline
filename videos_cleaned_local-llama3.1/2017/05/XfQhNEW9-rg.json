And like, that happened in the blink of an eye - like within 3 years, Hollywood Video, Blockbuster, all those Mainline ones just like fell off the face of the Earth. And it was because of things like Netflix coming out, changing their model, even like Netflix going from being the rental service where they would send you DVDs to streaming - that just killed it entirely. Yeah, and I'm especially bummed by that because video store clerk was like my backup job, if you know what I mean. Either everything fell apart and I couldn't get a job doing something else, or if I made enough money where I didn't give a ****, I would love to do that - just hang out in the freaking video store all day long and talk about movies.

I hated hearing him get rejected. Yeah, and and I and I it put me in such an awkward spot to the point where when I would hear him say \"Oh, God.\" A few of them had like their own catchphrases; they had their own like way that they approached these things, right?

But it's something you don't think about then they take that out of your cost of whatever they sell it for and what they're going to pay you - it's all this like cycle.
