What do you think? Do we really not... We did it. Bloodborne - no, I - You guys need three press conferences which Saturday announced for the same time spot that it always is, Monday nights. Is it before Mike? It's before Microscope now Sensor last well this is the last one on Monday night so now for a Nintendo depending probably on a Tuesday or it's good no press conference so it's probably going to be direct following Puppets Treehouse.

When did the last one come out it's only two units right or for Union 15 so it was 2015 in Japan, right it makes sense and when you look at what games they announced two years ago well games they announced last year and the ones that have already come out the ones that we know the release dates are coming.",

There's a giant cargo plane; you load everybody in the cargo plane with nothing - just the clothes on your back, no weapons, no spoon, nothing. They fly you over this big ass, like ARMA-sized island, and then people choose where they're going to jump out, and you can kind of parachute over two places on either side of the airplane's track through the island. Then you have to scrounge through houses, buildings - whatever you find, collect guns, more backpacks, grenades, all sorts of other kinds of accoutrements of death. And then you have to murder everybody else on the island. Hell yeah!

And it's also squad mates too, so you can do so they can be matchmaking as a single player, you can match make into you know 1 vs. 100 basically where nobody teams up and it's just every man for himself that's really tense and awful but you can do duos or for up to 4 players squads as well. And when you do that then you like you parachute in with your guys all in one spot, you find a be armored up and then you find a good place to hide out and what you think is going to end up being the center of the map at the end and like everybody watches one corner of the building and you're all unvoiced and it's it's just is sound and awesome.

If you have to view our headset, or if you don't have a VR headset, you can do that by just using a gamepad and a normal PC. You can find us on Steam just search for The Foo Show. I talk to people who make games, so I talk to people who make games while we're inside their actual games. You load it up, you put the headset on, you're standing in the watch tower from Firewatch talking to Jake and Syd (not Ron) from Campo Santo with me. And you can look at it; I tell stories about how the game is made. I've done an episode with Brendan Greene of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (not \"chunk of cuadrado cowboy\") and then also the next one that's coming up hopefully by the time you guys find out, but within the next week or so, I'm talking to a biochemist who makes nano machines out of DNA. It's kind of like Shane's nanomachine; it's not like Melanie money when we go all the way down. So like we start out in his lab.",

So like, we start out in his lab and then we zoom down to some of his equipment, then we zoom down again - it's like a microscopic scale. We could see cell-like E. coli swimming around, and then we zoom down one more time. Tweaks to the DNA coming out of them. So you might learn something on that course. Will get hyped, get in there until next time. I love you, Fox died. Hopefully you enjoy that. Up next is the Kinda Funny Gamescast.
