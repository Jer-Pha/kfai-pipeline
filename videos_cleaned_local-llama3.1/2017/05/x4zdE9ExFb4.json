Topic: just like all these people did to leave your questions, comments, and concerns. John Bernie Carr says, \"What if Zelda came out mid-gen on PS4 and was called Link's Adventure? Would people still give a ****?\" It's a very interesting thing. I definitely think people would give it way less attention. I think it would be a slow build of a **** like no one would be like, 'Day 1, million copies moved.' It would just be like this: everyone's like, 'If you play Link's Adventure and play that, and then you're playing like... oh, it's an adventure game, really good.' Yeah, exactly. I mean, it feels a lot like... so yeah, man. I'm sitting over here thinking about Oceanhorn was a port.",

Do you think the Zelda game essentially screwed the upcoming Spider-Man game with its climbing mechanic? Not even revenge on British complain to Spidey can attach to every single wall now. I imagine that Spider-Man is going to be a very different style game. I think that it'll be an open-world, but it'll be much more designed, tight New York yeah and it's going to be a lot of fun to move around, but it's going to be I think a bit more tunnel-visioned in experience. Going to have the same problems every Spider-Man game has. I'm just like wow, it's so disorienting when you climb onto a roof, you know?

The name is Rash, Pimple, Zit, and Herp; it's not that. That's not been my good friend Wart. Well, how many of those names hurt? Hurt? It was probably the fourth one. Game Herpe, we named six people there. See some of the Battle, but I don't like that game. If you like that game, you have that taste. Some things like that being said, Rare is a very good developer; it's true. Jason Hale says, \"What are we getting the Duck Dynasty review?\" Yeah, it's been a while. Please do it.
