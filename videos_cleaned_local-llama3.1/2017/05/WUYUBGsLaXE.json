A lot of people have been asking who is going to host the show this year KFL 1 we had the illustrious Troy Baker, KFL 2 we had Rooster Teeth's Burnie Burns, and ladies and gentlemen I'm proud to officially announce that WWE Superstar Xavier Woods will be hosting Kinda Funny Live three. It's a new day indeed. Also making a return KFL appearance is Mega64, who is once again going to tear the house down. Of course there's a ton more surprise guests but you know all right let's talk about the three limited exclusive posters first off here is the amazing official KFL 3 poster designed by Panda Musk. Obviously I'm a big fan of this one. Next up we got a fun one designed by Bab Star, the artist behind The Boondocks. So hell yeah. Finally the man, the myth, the legend Cool Greg designed this one and got it digitized by fellow best friend Travis Smith and that's pretty damn cool now moving on to t-shirts we have two limited",
