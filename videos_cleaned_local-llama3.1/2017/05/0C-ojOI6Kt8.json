The 14 months later they make good on this conversation, and we're like, 'They should send us some pizzas.' And then a week later, we get a giant freezer box. We open it up, there's seven Digiorno buffalo chicken pizzas inside. This **** with a note from Digiorno - that's the most important part. Let me go get the note... You feel me? Talk about it, Greg. So I was shocked by this because when I saw this, I was just like, 'Wow, this is the long con.' Like they saw this tweet a year ago and they're like, 'You know what? It's in production.
