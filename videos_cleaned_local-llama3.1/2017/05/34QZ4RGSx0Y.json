A **** it's interesting because you look at the exclusive games right now, right Nintendo is in its own little **** world, it'll always be there, it's going to have its IP and it is what it is but when you look at Xbox versus PlayStation we've discussed the exclusive thing death at this point sure where it's like all right PlayStation's very much succeeding in its exclusives.",

It had Halo 5 came out Master Chief Collection before that Gears, it's like those are kind of their the big franchises so it's like all right Horizon is very good and then for yeah is there another need for a shooter? No don't think so is it a big RPG I don't even know like what well if the question is like if I can have any any game that my answer to this question has always been that I would make a Justice League game, that's just like aam like I would make a Justice League game so there's tons of them were in a",

Uh, if you travel a lot get the Switch, uh, if you probably prefer shorter experiences that you are more likely to play by yourself maybe get PlayStation VR but there's also like VR is pretty rad like if if you happen to really like that tech and you haven't tried it PSVR is a great way to do that it's very easy yeah um if you can find one you can't find a Switch either so there's that, there's and I feel but I feel like it's that thing where a year ago we would have been more bullish the other way or one way or the other whereas I feel like now that both Switch and VR are out I feel like one's getting support the other VR is going down.",

I mean, I also think that I mean I loved PSVR, I didn't buy one and I had all the experience that I need playing your guys', you know, and it's like I'm a little bit lucky that I work in the industry and have all my friends have it but it's just like I'm sure you can find somebody if you really wanted to play that would let you borrow it for a weekend, they probably own all five awesome experiences that you can do them all and then you're done. It's pretty easy to say that you'll get more time out of Switch than you would out of PSVR just with Zelda alone.

A specific game did someone really inspire you to cover video games, and was IGN your dream job? So um, I think my answer to this is very similar to most other people's, and that it was a complete accident. Uh, I was working in this terrible job in a call center which I hated so naturally I was looking for jobs elsewhere, and uh, I'd always loved writing, I'd always love games, and I just saw a listing for a volunteer news writer for a games website, and I was like, \"I totally do that on my spare time.\" So I started doing that, and then it was like this is the best thing, and then just worked my way up to doing it.",

My first article was published on May 6th, so like kind of soon. Um, what was it? What was the other half of that question? Was it IGN? The dream I wanted to work at a place like IGN or GameSpot, uh, for sure. And I wouldn't say like that I had that one goal, but it was definitely I wanted to work in the US because the industry is so much bigger here, and there's kind of a ceiling in Australia.

Um, yeah, it's tough like I work late a lot of the time, and the biggest problem I have is that I live with a bunch of uh housemates who when I get home at like 10:00 p.m. at night off to work and going to the gym, and then I I can't make a video because it would be super rude because I would keep all my housemates up, so that is like the biggest problem is finding the time. It's also like it's very hard for me to respond to things, like I make videos about lifestyle stuff or current news, like I did a Pepsi ad reaction video which was like okay I know I have to do this right now but how the heck do I find the time to do that? It's really hard to respond to things immediately. But um, yeah, I don't know, I I block out time, I plan things literally months in advance, I have the the YouTube videos I plan on making for probably the next year in a list and I just sort of reorder them all the",

I have the YouTube videos I plan on making for probably the next year in a list and I just sort of reorder them all the time. It's just like I have to be very organized about it. How many videos you put out a week is just one, I usually like because I have to be flexible on times I can't publish like at a certain amount. I try and do every 5 days sometimes it's more sometimes it's less so got yeah, I think uh being more on point on dates would probably work better but just with the way that my schedule is and traveling so much I can't totally I do what I can yeah yeah you're doing it well thank you. Gareth McCrindle says \"What games have you never played?\" SL wanted to play because they weren't available in Australia, um I think uh games being banned in Australia is exaggerated and that it doesn't when you when you live there you're angry about the news but then you seem to just end up getting access to everything.",

The only thing that I really wanted was I think LA Noire was originally censored in Australia and I really wanted the uncensored version, that was the big one, yeah they they shot and disappeared or became flowers or some **** like that, that would have been nicer no the body disappeared um which like I hated so I just played the uncensored version found a way to play it. But then on the flip side um South Park: The Stick of Truth is also censored but I think the way they censored it is funnier than the thing they censored, so it's like basically someone I think in the US version presses a button and then Randy Marsh just gets a dildo up his butt I think that's what happens he gets probed he gets probed in the alien ship right something goes up his butt but in\"",
