It boils down to this: You guys know our good friend Hunter Pence, who plays for one team called the San Francisco Giants. Now in baseball, they do something called \"giving someone a pat on the back\" or \"a good game,\" where they give you a little pat on the ass. Okay, it's not considered sexual harassment; I don't know if they still do that, and I've never seen Hunter do it. But they do do that. On some level, I'm sure someone somewhere still gives the good game. I'm just saying: You had a good game today. You got two pats on the back\u2014one from me and one from Craig. Okay, I actually got four from Greg today. Wow, that seems excessive. It's a great game. Having said that, you may have a lawsuit on your hands there. You go! Oh man.

So everything else you added on top of it was just... it just made it even more and more brilliant.

You're like, 'All right man, do it,' and that's when we hit up Jeff and Burnie and like all their team.

And then I would follow them, right? Yep. But I never really saw a dedicated Kinda Funny artist person that would just make fan art and stuff like that.
