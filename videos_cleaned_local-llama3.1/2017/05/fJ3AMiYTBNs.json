Everyone else incredibly confusing. What's the origin of that? You're like, \"Charizard, you're my dude.\" Yeah, okay. I didn't put a lot of thought into it. It's actually on the back of my senior jersey from high school, like that's how long I've had that. It's a username from back in like Myspace days, and it kind of got to a point where I was like, \"I'm aware that I should change this for marketing purposes,\" too late now, too long; I can't.

There's a few turns I am I'm using be on while still accelerating while still drifting but having to pop down. I feel like you use the drift as the break and then just adjust that's what I'm saying it's kind of just like an on-rails game to an extent where just like you're just going and you're just controlling where it goes, but I think that the 200cc brings a different level of skill where you actually have to use the brake to maneuver the course. So it's like I feel like for people that are looking for a actual challenge like a racing experience, that might and that speed it up to which would slow the game down a bit. Tried it on Reddit there was a discussion of 150 vs 200 and there was a lot of people like us who just like 150 sucks and I put I was like I just hate 200 sucks. I'm sorry, 200 sucks.

And I'm like there's an argument to that cuz yeah you are doing and that's why I I actually stopped in the flight because I was like I My Hope was I'd do this so I'd be like how when you you know 50 might have been hard for you 100 was hard for you get to 150 CC you go back in your and you're like oh my God like I can I drift so easy I'm like I'll do that 200 but 200 was making me play so much so differently that I'm like this actually going to **** me up when I go back to play 150 That's pretty rad though, that something like a speed increase can make it almost feel like a different game Yeah it's interesting and I think that the the kart series has evolved slightly over time to get to where it's at with Mario Kart 8 where",
