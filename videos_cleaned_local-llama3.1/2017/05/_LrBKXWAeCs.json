I.e., is there still an uproar? Has there been a noticeable decrease or increase of subscribers? Do you expect any awkwardness at KF Live 3, etc.? Thanks for all the amazing content you guys produce. James. So obviously, for anybody that's been involved uh in Kinda Funny and all the things that we do, Colin leaving was a major change - probably actually no, 100% the most major change we've ever had. Uh, we had the studio; we hired Kevin; we hired um Andy; you know, like we've been doing a lot of things like that; we've added new shows; we've uh had shows go away; we've done live shows - all of these things as crazy as they they might be or as different and um radical as they seemed at the time.

And that's the thing - there are people that are just vile, there's just a lot of vapid negativity. But then there also is a lot of constructive criticism. But even when it's constructive criticism, even when it's criticism that I don't agree with, I read all of it. I am so involved in this stuff and I care about Kinda Funny so much that I want people to be happy.
