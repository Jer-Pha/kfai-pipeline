But that's the point, it's like no one ever rides them Pikes there you go, yeah uh nailed it. There's just not a lot of vehicle integration and this is coming from Bungie, the developer of Halo, even though it's a different studio, a different team nowadays where Halo is the trifecta of first-person shooter gameplay - it does guns, grenades, and vehicles all incredibly well, it feels great and balanced.

The war just... going on. The floor is falling underneath you. You make and your enemies are flying, and like it's this long level, and it's intense, man. Like that is what Destiny misses in terms of vehicles. Is there are no moments like that at all in the game, and it could benefit so much from them because the world is beautifully designed, and I want to jump on vehicles, and I want that experience, but it's just not been implemented in the right way. The setup's there; they've got footage of like a tank. We don't know if we could actually get into the tank. There's no footage of us piloting it. It's funny because the Guardians run by the tank as if it was on their team, so I wonder if it's like a player-piloted tank. Like that would be so cool, Greg Miller",

All this one level just looking at how beautifully designed and detailed the world is in Destiny right now. Um, I don't know that that it's technically possible, but I am not a game developer. I well, you can work upwards right where you can essentially build for the specs of a PC or a Scorpio or PS4 Pro or whatnot, and then just kind of downscale it from there. The other thing is, um, I'm currently producing this month's IGN First, which is Darksiders 3. I don't know if you guys are into that, but it's a beloved sort of classic favorite uh franchise, a Zelda-like one of the developers talks a lot about this new technology that they're using. I guess it's not maybe that new, but games have been using it for a while, but they've really streamlined it and it's called level.",

And that might be one strategy by which the Destiny team creates a faux sense of an open world, and that would be awesome. I hope it's better than how it was in Tony Hawk's American Wasteland. You ever play that? No. They were like, \"Oh, this is a...\" Yeah, okay. Well, that was like the first one that was... The last good Tony Hawk was two.

So, you default to guns and strategies that lower your TTK right? So last word, it had a really low TTK which was why it's so strong.
