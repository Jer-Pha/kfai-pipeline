Yeah, World of Warcraft's Spider-Man had this to say: I was shocked at first, but having arms like this is actually pretty rad. Well, there you go; there you go. Probably, I'd say the same thing, to be honest with you. Oh yeah, I'm Biff - your boy Biff is back! We're bringing you another nonstop volume of Arms action, so expect a healthy dose of stretchy limbs. I'm feeling it; I'm going to be honest. But first, it's time for Arms 101. Take some notes; it's time to get schooled. Boys always comes in handy when selecting arms. Pay attention to two things: weight and attributes. If you guys are wondering what all that racket was a second ago, it was Kevin literally eating M&M's out of the powerful but also slower for multi-hit arms. The power of hits - God, it's not even worth it! I hate you guys sometimes. Punches may even run into each other; turn up the direct; the chat is saying or heav you can block punches so you have to choose whether to dodge a punch or block.",

So something people noticed about some of their arms is they're swirly, some of them aren't. So they were coming up with the whole backstory of some of the robots. It's like I guess that was a debunk today, it's like poisonous and non-poisonous snakes - what is that like? I think poisonous have the eye of Saron and non-poisons have just the circle.

They're totally like going a little bit too deep with it, but I mean I'm sure you get ARMS. She must be a genius and she's out to prove it by joining the ranks of the ARMS Fighters she admires so much. She's probably a normal human being without the ARMS, but that's her robot, yeah. She reminds me of a TR Bomb, oh yeah, exactly. Just look at her - who wouldn't want to cheer for this girl? I sure do. Here are her signature moves: you want to hit her with that Whammer.

The hottest trend in the Arms league is, of course, multiplayer battles and so on behalf of the league I'd like to introduce you to a variety of play styles in Versus mode.
