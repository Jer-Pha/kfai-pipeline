It weirded me out too because everybody went in expecting it to be like what Adam Sandler does, what every Adam Sandler is like, punchline evident. Chris Farley was supposed to be the main character in that. Chris Farley was supposed to be Shrek. They actually recorded most of his dialogue too; that's crazy. Who would have been a distinctly different movie? There's also there were always rumors that he was supposed to be one of the early Dan Aykroyd Ghostbusters, Ghostbuster 3s was built around him like being one of the Ghostbusters, and that's one of the reasons it was off course.

But then you also have this closest analog I have to this, obviously, is Kim Kardashian. Right? Like, clearly, Lena has been inspired by how Kim Kardashian's career has unfolded. And Kim Kardashian, obviously, is someone who's very much known for being calculated in how they disseminate these quote-unquote \"oops\" accidental things. Right? So I like about her is she's just taking that curtain away and saying, \"**** that. I'm going to do this.

I think it is, but I I think it is, but I don't like also I'm convinced you don't like hamburgers either. No, I love hamburgers. I literally you don't like any in the city every single time we go to a hamburger place, you're like, \"I don't like that place.\" That's not true.

Here's what I will say though, to your point, and this is a hot take from Greg that we've danced around before: I think it's the fact that I think a burger is a sandwich, and it is fine in there; it does have it, and I think that I think that it backs up your point 'cause a lot of burgers are... a lot of burgers, right?
