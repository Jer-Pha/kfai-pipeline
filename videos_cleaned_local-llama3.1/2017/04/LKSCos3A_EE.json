Write prose Vanek says: As you are the biggest Mass Effect fan I know, is Mass Effect Andromeda worth looking at even though I haven't played games like Zelda yet? Yes, absolutely. Um, I have said at length that it does have a ton of problems but at its core it's still a really great game and while I have been frustrated by some of its technical issues, I'm still going to go back.",

And while I have been frustrated by some of its technical issues, I'm still going to go back eventually and play it again. I just am not immediately enticed to go back as I have been with previous Mass Effect games. And I think that is in part two reasons: one, I want to wait until all the patches get in place; and two, there's just a lot of really good stuff to play right now. Yeah, yeah, yes. If you like Mass Effect at all, I highly recommend going to play it. Andy Cortes, can you go get Andy? Kevin, yeah, I need his feedback on this because he is the second biggest Mass Effect fan I know. I know, calm down, Andy. So, you are she's the number one Mass Effect fan; you're the number two Mass Effect fan as the number two Mass Effect fan in the world. Have you played Mass Effect Andromeda yet?
