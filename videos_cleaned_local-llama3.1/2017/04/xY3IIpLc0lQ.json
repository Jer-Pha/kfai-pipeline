Oh good, well, it's nice. Why is it no? Why why is it that Here I am, your host, I love your question, I'm here to answer all of them. You are not answering any questions though, no he asked me anything for April 2017, I'll be answering all of your questions left over at patreon.com slash kinda funny games, having a pretty good day, I'm glad this is here, there's a Father's Day dance / - do it again, I believe this is yet another day, what's I mean April 17th? Oh how do you say ask me anything and ah so I'm gonna say a little more slangy but I want them in lo que se ho ho I throw buckets here right, ask me whatever you want, let's get right in here.

Sane Trilogy does well I think that that might up the chances did even then it just seems like a little bit too much of a grasp like the game is amazing but you know Trust Games is really known for its kind of original trilogy at games CTR was more for the fans when people bring it up Crash Bash like I mean no they're not get a remake crash bandicoot mass but CTR I one can hope I feel like a PSN release on PlayStation 4 is a bit more likely than a full-on remake and it definitely won't be DLC there's a totally different engine in the Crash games there's a",

There's a totally different engine in the Crash Bandicoot games; there's a totally different system and different type of game that's not as simple as just porting it up. And also they've been putting so much love into the remakes \u2013 like every little trailer that released, I'm just blown away. Like this seems to be one of the best from-the-ground-up remake kind of remaster plus whatever the hell you want to say of a game I've ever seen. So I'm pretty stoked about that. Patrick Star (corrected from \"Canon\") \u2013 so hey Tim what Switch game announcements are you hoping the Nintendo makes? It's III, oh man I feel like I've talked about this a million times; I could talk about it a million more. I'm really hoping that they make a lot of announcements.

I got a we're getting a lot of port territory but I feel like Nintendo's in a weird place where this first year is going to be a lot of ports and we already know we got Mario Odyssey Zelda Breath of the Wild. There's not that I mean if Nintendo has a pantheon of established IP intellectual properties they definitely range in terms of their size and scope and their level of triple-A, right? So you have the big ones like the Mario Pok\u00e9mon Zelda but then there's all the other weirder ones, the Mario Kart Smash Bros Animal Crossing and all of them have their own place that make sense in their own way. Animal Crossing and Pok\u00e9mon are examples of not exactly system sellers but for as many systems sold they're probably going to sell a",

So once you get beyond the Zelda and Mario brand new big full adventure Zelda and Mario games this year, I don't know what else they can do. I feel for the core game or Metroid is the answer, but historically Metroid games haven't sold too well, so it's time for Metroid to come back, and I think that people will hopefully be hungry enough for it that it'll be a success. But in terms of you three announcements, I don't know; I hope there's just a lot of them, and I hope Nintendo surprises me and doesn't let me down. And honestly, I'm going into it like hoping for the best but expecting to be let down because that's what they've kind of done for the last couple years, and even with the",

So somewhere in the middle, there... Let's aim for it. Christopher J Brennan says \"Hey Tim, I've been trying to wrap my head around this trend of these incremental console upgrades - ie PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox Scorpio. What's the point of these upgrades, especially Scorpio? It is four times as powerful as Xbox One, but to what end? Developers aren't allowed to make games that take full advantage of the extra power because they need to develop for the lowest common denominator base consoles - it just seems like a huge waste of specs and makes the upgrade seem pointless. Microsoft has stated they believe the traditional console",

Having said that, those games are gorgeous on a PS4 on a 1080p TV as well. At what point do I not necessarily think we just need more and more and more teraflops and graphics and all this stuff? It is getting to a place where it's an optional upgrade if you are somebody that cares about that stuff. Xbox, obviously, is in a place that they're playing catch up a bit, and I think that having big announcements and headlines they can say the strongest console that will sell when people go into GameStop and the marketing all over is the most powerful system like that will entice people who are considering it, and like if you're not hardcore and super into it, like having exclusive games on the PlayStation 4 might not.",

The biggest obstacle for me has always been I have my own vibe and I have my own interests and Kind of corner of videogames and expertise that I have that does not line up with Greg Miller and Colin Moriarty, and I think the biggest obstacle I've ever had is that people want me to be Colin and Greg and I'm not and I never will be and I never was.

Because I feel like it does have a higher standard of things being amazing. Having said that, when you're talking on podcasts and stuff, a lot of times you speak in hyperbole. So me saying \"oh that's **** awesome\" isn't necessarily equivalent to a 10 out of 10; it's just the experience I had at the time. So the obstacle for me has just been getting over people's expectations of what I'm doing, what it's supposed to be. But I mean, I just keep doing it, and it's been working out.
