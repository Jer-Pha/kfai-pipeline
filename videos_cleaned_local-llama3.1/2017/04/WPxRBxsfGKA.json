Sane Trilogy thing but it doesn't say we're if it's exclusive and that's the question we're asking is kind of enriching that story that way so that's how we're fighting against that um as far as like the future of games journalism I think it's um we're at this weird precipice now where we everything I just said about enriching that story we have to do because I think ultimately like",

Like more and more you know you don't need a middleman to deliver to your audience and like maybe our audience right now might be bigger than the number of people who read the PlayStation blog but the hardcore PlayStation crowd is still probably going to go directly to the source in a lot of cases and so I think like in order to keep game journalism going, I think it is the things that aren't necessarily subscribing to that PR drop mentality which is you know the leaks and the scoops and things like that but then it's also if you are going to report on the thing that people have put out there what can you add to it what can you what interview can you get to a company that that is giving the",

And that's why as you see more and more Indies start to do stuff that's interesting because those guys get to come out and speak with their mind on whatever they want, like a Steve Gaynor or uh Sean Vanaman can just get up and talk about their game more openly. I think uh as people get you know like and those are interesting examples actually because you have these kind of high-profile Indie developers who are working with the big first parties and so maybe they do have to you know keep an eye on what they can say, like when you get a a fully true independent like I can say whatever I want smaller game I think you do tend to get more candid answers um even like uh like we mentioned Hidetaka Miyazaki like the interview he did here and the interview",

Can it get up by this date? Like I think it's a little more of an exact science than news. I feel like news is a lot of checking your gut and uh really digging deep to make sure that like what you're running is is you know it's that balance between being accurate and being timely, and like yeah I can spend 6 months verifying something before I run it but by the time I run it it's probably old news or I'm oh it turns out Spider-Man is coming out September 21st and it's December everyone knew that you know uh so I think like that doesn't you know I I don't want to wait so long that it's not topical anymore, but I also don't want to just rush into it and have that situation.\"",

I got a couple questions from the audience for you about news, no just about other stuff we'll find out there this from Jos 2K how was your time working for a game dev like Gearbox versus The Press media like IGN? Uh, it was really educational.
