You've had Minority Report for the last couple days. How'd that go, Kevin Coello? It was very okay. People seem to like it. Just very okay. A lot of people really liked it. A lot of people liked it. That was all right. I enjoyed the pictures and memes that we received from it. Yeah, it was great. My favorite was the high five. See this? No. Oh, man. It's the best one. I'll find it. Okay, cool. Appreciate it. Nick, how are you? I'm well. I'm well. I had a good weekend. Uh, as you know, uh, I came back from Austin on Saturday morning. Yes, you did. Uh, watched a little film over the weekend called Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Okay. Why? Paused it halfway through and just started describing to my wife the topic that we had on Ace Ventura.
