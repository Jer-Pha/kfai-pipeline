As always, I'm Tim Gettys joined by one half of the coolest dudes in video games, Greg Miller. It's me. I put stuff in my hair 'cause I already had the stuff in my hair, but I've noticed recently in the morning shows I'm just getting too lazy about it. I'm just coming in; the hair is doing whatever it's too fluffy. I need to cut it, but I need to let it go a little bit longer. What's in it? What are you using right now? I'm using Garnier Fructis. Think of that when you hear \"old\" Garnier frizz. Yeah, the Diamonds and Guns album - a little frutis made its way into the ear canal. \"Diamonds and Guns\" by uh, The Transplants. Is this really the song? 'Cause I'm going to download this song about that album because of the G.A.N.G.",

Wait still like now in 2017, like such nice coffee table books, well some of them, dude; there's some nice ones by the way, there's some really amazing ones, like I just got the Mass Effect: Andromeda it's like a nice hardback one, The Horizon Zero Dawn ones, like there's some really nice ones and not because I want to skip ahead and figure stuff out but I'm super interested in sort of what what are the developers intend to do and I usually don't look at them until the game's done with, yeah.",

Then are you do you have a backlog which then means you have a backlog of strategy guides that's like very meta - all you have the game still sealed in the rap and then you have the strategy guides still sealed in the rap. I do because I get them together, I always get them together, like very rarely will get a game and then two months later go \"you know I kind of want to get the strategy guide\" and sure, sure. Like the Zelda ones, and I actually show my wife often times the the strategy guides are insane. Have you ever like open the Zelda strategy guide? I mean it's like an encyclopedia. The Pok\u00e9mon ones these days are insane too. I mean I remember back in the day like I was",

So, I mean, Nintendo Power was like my Bible, and they would have the player's guides and like they treated the player's guides, which was Nintendo strategy guide, they treated them as kind of extensions of the magazine. So, I would buy these strategy guides for games that I didn't even have just because I liked the presentation, I wanted the collection, and all that. And then when I got into the Final Fantasy games, like I remember the Final Fantasy X one from BradyGames was like it's like a Bible, crazy, and I loved them in the Pok\u00e9mon ones, I was all about sure. And that was the thing is, I think so you're you want them for the insight into the game and what the developers wanted to do.

How to get through this cool stuff right exactly. No, it's more it's more just for the devs to see what the whole thing comes out as at the end.
