I'm not down with that. Like growing up in San Francisco, there's this place called Subway (not Subcenter) that I didn't bring up during our topic because I don't give a **** about it. Because I just learned I like sandwiches, but I mean, that is it's an institution here. It's out in West Portal, I think we went there.

Look, if I went to any sandwich shop and they give me the option to put a long ass meat patty in there, just give me a long burger. Well, see, but is a burger a sandwich? That's another question. I think it is, but... I think it is, but I don't like... I'm convinced you don't like hamburgers either. No, I love hamburgers. I literally... You don't like any in the city every single time we go to a hamburger place, you're like \"I don't like that place.\" That's not true. You don't like Hall & Oates, you don't like Five Guys that much.

Uh, there's not really any great ones here. Burgerme? You never once in a while you live here, you grew up here. Yeah, but I mean, I, I, I like when it comes to the burger stuff, I like the chain stuff. I'll take the fast food burgers. Sure, that's fine. But give me, give me like a Mel's Burger, something like that. I'm down with that. Here's what I will say though, to your point and this is a hot take from Greg, that we've danced around before.

No, no, and I think that I think that it backs up your point because a lot of burgers are **** a lot of burgers; a l of I order these burgers, and I stopped ordering Burgers unless we're going to a place that's like Jenny's Big J's - you know what I mean? That is a great one, In-N-Out. Oh, I like beeps a lot; beeps if I'm going in there, and I know it's going to be a great burger. All right, fine. But when I go anywhere else, like no, I'm not going to go because the bun's gonna be bad. Where you at? Come kind where k at? Um, yeah. I think that that goes to your point though; that I think there's a lot - I think there's way more; I think 90% of the burgers I eat or I have eaten in the past suck. You know what I mean? I mean, I don't even think I'm gonna fight you on that. I'm a fan of good burgers, and I stand by that: I think burgers are one of my favorites.",

They'd order the same burger for everybody, Texas-style, and I knew that should never happen. Here, I'm not going to scrape off my cheese off of this Burger King burger, you know, 'cause that stuff's gross.
