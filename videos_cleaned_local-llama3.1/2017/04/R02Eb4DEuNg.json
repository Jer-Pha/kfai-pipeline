This news comes via the Wall Street Journal's technology reporter in Tokyo, Takahashi Mo isuki Mochizuki on Twitter. Nintendo Chief says number of Fire Emblem downloads less than one-tenth of Mario but revenue bigger than Mario. Super Mario Run is a free download; however, it costs money if you want to progress past the first three levels and the boss. The level unlock for Mario is a one-time payment of $10.

Then Fire Emblem Heroes is the example of well, no, we're just going to do what we know works on this platform, and guess what, it works.
