We have a special guest, yeah, Lorne Lanning's here. Every time he comes over, he's like \"I'm like, would you like something to drink?\" We have only coffee, water, and maybe a soda, and he's like \"How about some sugar-free fruit Red Bull?\" And I'm like, \"You sir, are a champion.\" So did you bring them or did they just magically appear?

What about GameCube? Yeah, yeah, I think it's gonna be GameCube too. I think it's positioned better to take more uh install base than each of the ventures you just mentioned, but the the thinking has to change so the biggest problem I see at Nintendo is the thinking.

I don't know - a million; they're all dorks too. Yeah, over 100 million, right? How many on PS4 now? About 70, is that right? Uh, Microsoft doesn't have the whole thing on it, right? So that's",

Yeah, right, well, that's what that is for me, that's what's been fascinating about the launch - I thought for sure it would come out, sell how it's somewhere, and then have an opinion around it that was like negative more negative. And it's been so positive, but I do wonder if at EA, if at Ubisoft, they are like \"Should we get a team of 10 people to make some little thing that ties into whatever to put it over there?\" How often do we see those publishers targeting one platform? Yeah, super rare. Right, so they instead they've been looking at it like is it worth the cost of a conversion. But again, my my my question I guess or even point or whatever would be the fact that I don't think that if they're like \"I get 10 people to make an Uncharted Hearts\" but that can go everywhere because that's the whole",
