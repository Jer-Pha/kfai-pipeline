Most of the album \"No Strings Attached\" does not hold up as much like especially all the B-sides. Like here at the end of the day, NSYNC is in sync with that for all their similarities they're very different and I think that there's a lot of classes that you need to kind of have the debate between on one hand there is dancing who's better at dancing insane, undeniably who's better at presentation stuff insane. That's all that they have but Backstreet Boys they harmonize which means their music does hold up better in it has the hits yeah but Backstreet also has quality and that's why they have so many hits they have more hits data and this is as an insider guy I'm going to type in Greatest Hits both go down this all",

And the reason I didn't like it was because I don't like movies where the central character is an anti-hero. At no point does he like me. My only critique with that story is that at no point did Michael Sarah's character, the titular character, ever like how anyone changed. That was the thing with the comic books or the graphic novels or whatever, where he changed and became a better Scott by the end of it. Where yeah, in this movie, and this one, he's like okay cool, I didn't get the girl I wanted, I'll get the other girl I want. We to rock and roll. I think that's how it ended.

That is a little bit weird to me, cuz obviously it's a bunch of guys who've done amazing stunt work for all these Triple A films and then they came together and I guess they all like there's like two or three directors on John Wick but only one of them gets credit doesn't matter.

I didn't watch Blade Runner until later because everyone says it's good, and then it was great, it was fantastic. But the thing is, like, that I had to do my homework to understand what Blade Runner is, and not a lot of people are going to take that absolutely seriously.
