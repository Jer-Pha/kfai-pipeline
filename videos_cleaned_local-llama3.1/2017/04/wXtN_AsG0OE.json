So will they do the Direct with the Treehouse app? I feel like there will be a Treehouse no matter what - it's a Treehouse live stream all day. Yeah, yeah, yes. Do they do the Direct? Do they do a live in-person press conference? I did not think they'd do a live in-person press conference, really. Yeah, ooh. What do you think? I think they'll do it. I think they kind of have to. I think they do a Direct and I think that is the best decision they can possibly make. Yeah, I am all about hype and I love being in the room. Yeah, and I love seeing people cheer and I love the awkward audience interaction - they're the only ones you can get that.",

I am now excited for a Nintendo Direct that speaks to me and is Reggie what's up everybody welcome to a Nintendo Direct. For this and we've had such success of the switch and we're working on the supply problem and they're not playing catch-up or playing from a little more of a position of strain exactly.

I mean Purely sure ever does Mario go down that similar thing where they're just not going to show much of it and we're going to keep it real simple, it's Mario, they don't need to show a lot. But they've got this big weird gap now that I think you know they got a they have to take out a fill, they really do have done the collated penological yeah begins how long until your Switch gets dusty? Who is the question and immediately now that I am quote-unquote done with The Legend of Zelda I'm already moving on to other stuff. And there's been a lot of fun to anything make that's great.

That game, sure, and I think the Switch is going to give it such a new life. It's going to give it a second chance. You think Cart will do well? What do you think Carl's gonna do? Cards are such a different case where everybody loves Card, and I don't love Robbing or not just having Card on a system is going to be if done a system seller.

I think we got to get all of the Wii U and 3DS games out of the way, and that will line up the thing to sell consoles with great attach rates. If they come out with Pok\u00e9mon Stars, which I think they're going to do, and it be Switch exclusive is the question. And I think the smartest move they can make is make it Switch exclusive, keep putting all the other games on 3DS yes, but if you want Pok\u00e9mon, yeah, you gotta get it. Yes, yeah, but they still have some Sun and Moon to sell on 3DS if that's where they're gonna try to do that.
