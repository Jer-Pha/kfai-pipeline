Fundin' incidentally, I think I think who's better at presentation stuff in fact, that's all that they have but Backstreet Boys they harmonize which means their music does hold up better, I think Hartley's because it's yeah, I've asked you boys have better quality another thing is - so when he hits them more hits debatably and this is a peninsula type of greatest hits boat we're going to get rid of challenges all right here the greatest hit in NSYNC only has three albums yes - your boys had like eight yes I don't know most of the laterally that's the thing they stuck around too long, every long yeah they got it right for now they're they're doing the biggest thing they lost Kevin for a while where did you",

I remember that's one of those memories like burned in my brain: I remember driving around in the Ford Taurus listening to \"Mambo Number 5\" and everything like... Look at my back, boy! They're not in the suburbs; this is diabolical. I got a yard, the colors in our record - we made it. Did a remix of \"Mambo Number Five\" with a Disney character? You know, I thought you were kidding me because you know that isn't what \"Mambo Number 5\" is about. My number five... read what there is this on \"Mambo Number 5\".

I feel like going back to the two NSYNC and whether or not it was okay to like them, I feel like I just went through that threshold after when I liked... I was a closet Backstreet Boys fan for a very long time, and then just kind of said to myself, \"Why am I hiding this?\" And then I went all in on it.

It's like let me just say this: you know, I mean. So I think going back to the debate, you bring up an interesting point here. I feel like NSYNC has more hits that aren't singles - if you just play like random songs from NSYNC, people would be like, \"Oh, yeah, here we go.\" Here we go was enough, yeah. We overseas basic video for it, but it wasn't like an official thing; it was featured in Smart House on Disney Channel, but it wasn't like a real thing. But people know that song.
