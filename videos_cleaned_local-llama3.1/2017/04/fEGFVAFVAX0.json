So are you going to are you think it's going to be like Avengers: Civil War? No, I'm not AV. I'm sorry, no, Age of Ultron. Lutely okay. We liked that was just more in the sense in in the sense that uh all the things that I liked about Avengers I got more of it in Age of Ultron instead of one spinny circle thing there was two spinny Circle things and those were both really great but at the end of the day I'm like oh Avengers is awesome, Avengers: Voltron is okay.

So what are your favorite comedies of the last couple years? Well, 21 Jump Street, I guess yeah. Is it like that? Is it supposed to be dirty Grandpa? Where you come down, dirty Grandpa. You got to take dirty grandpa. But 21 Jump Street, neighbors did you see Neighbors? I saw yes, I saw Neighbors. What do you think of Neighbors? It was fine. Was it better than you thought it'd be? Yes, better than I thought it would be. It was way better than I thought it'd be, and I'm getting that vibe from this given the Fast and Furious treatment where they're like we're just going overboard all okay, The Rock, yeah, Dwayne Johnson, no, um, Alexander's Obsession; she's amazing, she's great in True Detective.",

I'm in the minority; I'm one of the few people who watched that. I was like, and the reason I didn't like it was because I don't like movies where the central character is an anti-hero, and at no point does he undergo any significant character development. My only critique with that story is that at no point did Michael B. Jordan's character, the titular character, ever undergo a meaningful character arc, which was the thing with the comic books or the graphic novels or whatever, where he changed and became a better Spider-Man by the end of it. In this movie, though, he's like, okay, cool, I didn't get the girl I wanted; I'll get the other girl I want. Rock on, I think that's how it ended. I can't remember; there's an alternate ending in the movie that's like nails, where yeah, Nails, what was her name? Jennifer Lawrence, no...  Jennifer Connelly, no...

I mean Scott Pilgrim to me is one of the rare cases and and I think Kick-Ass is the same where I can't say the book's better than the movie where I'm like I think the book and the movie are both super good and they both nail the same tone but they don't tell the same story it's like the same kind of uh overall narrative but so many things are changed for the medium it's a different experience yeah because the the medium is completely different but just the visualization of Scott P versus the world like it's it's a really cute book but like when you're watching it just like the transitions he does and just bringing a comic to life and just like this it just slides from one scene to the other it's just really well done I'll give it super points for style absolutely super super points for",

He's got some weird ear thing where he has to listen to music the entire time, I forget that otherwise it's ringing or something. I haven't seen the trailer in a while. I saw the trailer and I was like, \"I'm in,\" and I kind of forgot about it. He keeps hearing a ringing sound. What's with the ear thing they always make fun of Tonti?

So it's it's that style of when the action happens it's super frenetic and fun and silly and super violent very similar to Kick-Ass, yeah very so I think like oh dude I that's another one of those things that One Punch Man sold me on I didn't realize that I wanted to see Colin Farrell in a role like that until I saw it right in front of me and I was like where has this been all my life? First off shout out to Colin Firth, right he does my heart good for him is the Bridget Jones's Diary oh really I was going Love Actually okay then I go love actually right because I love that movie as well but then like I do the same I think of Colin Firth as the guy who's in all of those Elizabethan like Victorian like Jane Austen movies right I'm like oh God then he comes out\"",

Uh, I feel like that movie isn't getting nearly enough hype as it should.

I didn't grow up with Blade Runner. I was obviously way too young for that. I didn't see it until later because everyone says it's good, and then it was great; it was fantastic. But the thing is, like, that I had to do my homework to understand what Blade Runner is, and not a lot of people are going to take that step absolutely not.
