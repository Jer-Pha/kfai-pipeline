So what I like about her is she's just taking that curtain away and saying, \"**** that, I'm going to do this.\" I have this clear marketing push toward this clearly. Like she hasn't said how she's going to uh distribute the sex tape, so my guess is if she's smart um and if she's watching, you should, you should very much do this; she should absolutely sell it, very not I, very not like food um but yeah.
