Do pineapples belong on pizza? Yeah, this debate again. Yes, oh man, we're already starting with the G. Be just like that. What do you fall down on this, Greg? Now it's a complicated question; it's a multi-faceted question. The question is, do pineapples belong on pizza? I of course am part of whatever gets you, yeah, let your freak flag fly if you want pineapple on your pizza if you want live mouse on your pizza, that's your choice, and I'm not going to get in the way of it. Would I put a pineapple on a pizza? No, I would not ever; I don't know, no, none of this Hawaiian style. I'm going to get it; I love Canadian bacon; I love Canadian bacon, but I like with some pepperoni, that's right, more salt and meat. What do I care?

Are they really? The world is getting divided. Yeah, where does he stand? Pineapple? He says yes. Troy Baker no, no pineapple. My God, was did I miss them? Other my apologies. Yeah, so this is this is a whole thing. For me, I've always stood that I like Hawaiian pizza. To me, it belongs in the world. It's not what I think of when I think of pizza. Sure, does it belong on pizza? You're right; your answer is correct, Greg.

You get a cold piece of pizza out, you want to eat it cold, you get the first bite and you catch a little slimy mushroom in your mouth that slithers down your throat makes you want to gag all over your own CR. You should eat a cold pizza; heat it up. What are you talking about? Cold pizza is okay. God, there's so many wars brewing in one topic. First off, I'm fine heating it up, but you know I like things cold because I'm lazy. How do you reheat your pizza though?
