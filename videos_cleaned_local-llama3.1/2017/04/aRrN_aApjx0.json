This game is awesome. While you're probably familiar with Tetris, Puyo Puyo is a puzzle series that's downright famous in Japan but hasn't seen much in the west. Similar to Tetris, pairs of Puyos fall from the top of your board and collect at the bottom. Played Kirby's Avalanche and rotate Puyos like your goal isn't to create a line but to gather a clump of the same colored Puyos and clear them from your board. The difference may seem small, but the strategies are very different, especially when you start setting up chains to drop garbage Puyo and sabotage your opponent's board. Garbage Puyo - are you up for the challenge? Well, a demo is launching on Nintendo eShop shortly after this presentation ends. W-the demo will give you a taste of both the solo arcade and multiplayer arcade modes. Unsure how to play? We've seen Game Mode is included.",

One of the most famous board games ever is coming to Nintendo Switch: Monopoly. I don't like that we see players can enjoy Monopoly in a whole new way and bring the board game to life anywhere at any time. Well, who knows? Maybe we'll get HD Rumble; it even feels like the dice are rolling in your hand. Oh man, there are exclusive tokens to earn, new boards to discover, and new rules that will change your strategy.

We can see this remote location separated from Anopolis on the other side of the ocean. This derelict man-made island is a hotspot for freelance Power Egg collectors. Amazing! Jumping to the island, we concluded that four Inklings make a team just like in Turf War and what are they wearing? The implications look like some kind of special gear provided just for this task, huh? And it appears they're given Weaponry too. I'm excited to give Splatoon another chance on Switch.

There are three new figures: Inkling Girl, Inkling Boy, and Inkling Squid. When you tap these amiibo, the figure character will appear in game and befriend you.
