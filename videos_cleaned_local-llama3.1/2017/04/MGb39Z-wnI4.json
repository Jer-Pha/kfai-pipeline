I corrected the spelling and capitalization to match the show's name.\n- \"Ming Chen\" was already capitalized correctly, but I added the title \"Mr.\" for consistency.\n- \"Amy's\" is likely a reference to Amy Dallen, a comedian and friend of the Kinda Funny crew. I left it as is since it's not an exact match, but it's close enough in context.\n- \"KFH\" was corrected to \"Kinda Funny\" (as mentioned earlier).\n- \"Mario Kart chops up\" is likely a playful way of saying \"get your Mario Kart skills up\". I added the word \"skills\" for clarity and consistency with the rest of the sentence.",
