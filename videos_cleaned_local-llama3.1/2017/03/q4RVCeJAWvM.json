He comes up here champ. This is my topic. This is hilarious. Nothing's making him happier right now. By the way, wait till he hears. I'm sure he's got that giant camera. He's like, \"Look at me. I'm watching myself. Watch everything about me.\" He comes up here. The first time I met Anthony, he came up to the old space at Greg's apartment. And he walks in. A, he's better looking than me. B, he's funnier and quicker on the uptick, right? And C, he has this like this drink that I've never heard of that I then everyone has been drinking it because Anthony or LaCroix.

Uh so we were sort of uh disconnected in a lot of ways to the ecosystem that was happening here in in San Francisco. Um but we would meet up at parties or go to, you know, we would go to Comic-Con and and see them. And I Anthony and I were sort of mutual admiration society. We both thought what the other guy was doing on their own show was cool. And we would see each other at parties and be like, \"Dude, awesome. Wouldn't it be awesome to work together?\" Yes. Cool.

And I had like that day read this article uh about the Fermi paradox and I was like it blew my mind because I had never heard of the Fermi paradox before that. I was like Anthony's a smart guy. I'd love to hear what he thinks about the Fermi paradox and let's just talk about that. And we talked about it for about 20 minutes. Weirdly, without planning on it, we started like doing characters in the middle of it and like jumping in and out of a weird improv. And none of that was planned.

And then through the course of the last 400 episodes that we've done, we've kind of gotten to know each other. Yeah. And I think that's been kind of the fun too is discovering things about each other on the fly as we record. So we really didn't know each other well before we started, but it as we said at the very beginning of this um it was just one of those things where we like had chemistry right away. Yeah. And it was fun and I think you know as I said learning to sort of be his straight man was was a very different kind of experience for me and one that I've really enjoyed too. Yeah, that's awesome.
