What's your go-to meal? How do you decompress? Uh, because most of the time I have such a like problem getting to sleep unless I can follow my ritual that I'll just stay up all night in my own head. Good and bad for for whatever reason, just thinking about what happened tomorrow or the day before. So I'm always fascinated by how other people deal with that. I don't know, Greg, what do you do when you go home? First thing first is walk my dog, of course. Right, got a walk my dog, got a feed my dogs.

I mean P's a little dog, I'm serving him like maybe you know, a tablespoon twice a day here right? You know, I mean so which used to be half of a small can, but think about how big that can is with all the other stacked up by the time I get to the bottom, that food's been open a while and I feel bad for him.

You've already eaten enough food. Fat dog, yeah. He needs to be told he could die. He could... I mean, humans can't die from being fat, but dogs, no one human being has never died from anything anyways.\" I yell at him for a long time, and then he continues to step up and be in my face and on my chest, and finally I go, \"**** you.\" I get up, I go give him a treat, I sit back down, play the game.

Like even when we grew up in high school there was no cell phones and so like I can't even remember what we did when we went home. I think it was just 5 hours of TV; that was pretty much it, yeah. But even then I don't think I played that. I guess I did play games in high school, yeah. It was like N64 and PC gaming so that's all I did. Well, what are you gonna do? I don't know, Tim.

Like we spend so much of our day talking to people that it's nice to just not say anything for three hours. Sometimes I'll play a game, uh, most of the time I write at least for 30 minutes to an hour every night. I'll just either work on screenplay ideas that I have or animated show or things... just things that like when when it's quiet that I can just focus and and that's I find that very relaxing. Although that that is due St sometimes too because if I if I get on a good thread then I'll be like oh that's awesome, I just wrote for 2 hours and it's time to go to bed but then I don't really want to do that I wanted like watch TV for at least an hour so now it's from Midnight to 1.

If you're ever like this, this is what I do if I'm ever in my own head, and this is a great tool to recommend for everyone: that if you're in bed and you're trying to force yourself to go to sleep, you're not going to go to sleep. So what I do is I change the sit circumstances - like, go out to the couch, get comfortable, turn on Star Trek: The Original Series, and I'll just watch an episode. And without fail, 30 minutes right around the time that like Kirk starts trying to like get on whatever girl they've introduced, I'll start falling asleep. No matter what. Do you go to the couch or stay in bed? I usually wait until I'm barely able to find the PS4 remote... yeah, and then I hit it, hit it, hit it, and then I'm back to the bed, and I'm done. Nice. So, so that's interesting - you say that because for me, I don't give up when I'm in bed and I can't do it; it's one of those where I like, all right, I'm clearly still...",
