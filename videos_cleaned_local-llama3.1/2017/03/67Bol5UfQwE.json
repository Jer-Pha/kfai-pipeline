You know, GameOverGreggy himself, Greg Miller, big fan of his show on Instagram, cooking with Greg, you can find him on the little hashtags and stuff; he's a big fan of cooking and stuff. Blue Apron has been really helpful with that because here's the deal: they send you little recipe sheets, all the things that you need; you can make each meal within 40 minutes or less. Tell me that's not a good deal, Kevin. It's a great deal, it is! It is. So, here's the deal: they are the number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service in the entire country. It is their goal to make incredible home cooking accessible to everybody, and that includes me; I haven't used it yet personally, but that's just because I'm just really not into cooking and stuff. But Greg, Greg's been loving it. Kev, have you used this? No, I haven't. But Paula really wants to get it. Oh, we got",

You talked a bit about it last week, sure. Yeah, I did. It was my review in progress and I was you know, to play then you played all the not all the mornings that's the thing it's like we came back and it was going to be uh, you know Mass Effect mornings here and I was going to play it all week long right? Yeah, literation good exactly. Think that's what I'm all about and uh, the **** PS4 **** straight up died like day one, like it just was like we were playing it and we showed all these bugs and then it just went down and I was like oh **** and eventually we got it back up and running and I did the Monday playthrough of it but it was that thing of well this is a story driven game but when you're streaming you're not really paying attention to the story, this isn't working for me. And then during the down period people were like \"you should play Zelda\" and I was like \"you want me to\"",

This isn't working for me, and then during the down period, people were like \"you should play Zelda.\" I was like, \"you want me to play Zelda B?\" So we've done Zelda every week morning since then. But the problem is, of course, when you put Mass Effect next to Zelda, you're like, \"wow, one of these is a master class in game design,\" and I **** can't get it out of my head. And so, like, I'm going home and playing more Zelda, not playing more Mass Effect. This jumps into what we were talking about a second ago, and the fact that the way I have been justifying in my head of the trade-off is because I I I played a lot of Mass Effect uh going into the Gamescast last week, played more of it then went to Edmonton for the heel kick stuff, and I was like, \"I'm going to take Zelda with me obviously.\" And I thought about buying the PS4; I'm like, \"I'm going to bring Zelda with me because Zelda is my playing game. Mass Effect's my home game\"",

I'm like, I'm going to bring The Legend of Zelda with me cuz The Legend of Zelda is my playing game. Mass Effect's my home game, and now as I've been playing so much more than trying to figure out what I want to do. I think I have to at this point admit that Mass Effect's fine - what I said last week right? Like, Mass Effect's fine. Uh, I enjoy the characters and everything else, but I think my time might be better spent playing Persona, and so I think I need to switch it over to Persona as the home game and make The Legend of Zelda a road game. So does that mean you're giving up on Mass Effect? Like, do you think you'll ever come back to that's that's the question. No, I don't think I will. You know what I mean cuz that's the thing - I like the Mass Effect characters enough and I like discovering the Andromeda galaxy enough, but like playing it that one morning where I was like, oh here are all these bugs and that's really annoying and this.",

I'm not going to platinum Metal Gear Solid V during the extra live stream; I'll come back for it.\" Yeah, never right. And what happened was, I think people came in with this expectation with this like just worry in the back of their heads that maybe this game there was always an element of that with Mass Effect: Andromeda where like they might fumble this, like they fumbled the ending of Mass Effect 3, and I think it confirmed it with some people.

And I don't know, like it's fine for people like us who we're not we don't care about that necessarily, but in the court of public opinion, I feel like having a toxic name is really dangerous for a game.

The dance in Horizon is like as good as I've ever played in a game; the combat dance, like it reminds me of games like Remember Me, where you just enjoyed like jumping and like going on carts and down, like Horizon. When I get into a fight with something, I'm not like worried about it and like trying to make sure that I beat them. Like some of the big boss fights are certainly like that, but like the beauty of just like everything down to the sounds those Apgar dinosaurs make or when you're knocking off like little parts and like the way they like buckle on the knee when you hit them the wrong way. Like everything about it is just that was the thing for me with in the combat of like getting, you know I'm a huge Freedom Wars fan right, and if you ever played that, but it is like sawing off specific things, and so when eventually the",

I think The Breath of the Wild is kind of the perfect evolution of both of those where it has the openness of the first Zelda but it's all logical. So oh it's too cold, I'm shivering right, I need to get hot how can I get hot? Oh if I wore warmer clothes you know or like uh it's it's all type things like that where like oh man I need to figure out how to shock something I I probably need to use electricity and something you're right so and that's like",

Shrines are there, there's 120 Jesus, which is a lot of them, which really makes you sad when you look at your screen; you're like \"I have 46 and I'm not finding them easy anymore.\" Like, where the **** are these? I've loved so many of the shrines. There was a handful of Duds, but overall, I'll give it to them because even the Duds tried something different. Right, and there's the minor test of strength and major test of strength or whatever, and like, there, there's a couple too many skipping all those major tests of strength; like nope. But, but at the same time, I do feel like there is a reward. Those tend to be the shrines that were harder to get to, so it's like getting to the shrine was the challenge. The shr...I've walked in where I like busted my ass to get there and like all right cool here it is; I love that. So good.

Uh, but man, like, the just I love the the use of your the Runes that's what they're called, the the Runes here they are in the beginning of the game master these things because you can be **** creative and do whatever you want. Every puzzle is going to use these things. The amount of times I'm in I'm in one of these shrines and I'm just like, \"I must not have... Nope, that's not the answer.\" You have everything that you're supposed to right now to beat this figure it out. Yep, it's great. And so many games don't do that; they keep their like Master stroke to the end. It reminded me of Half-Life 2 where it's like, \"No, here's the Gravity Gun. Like we're going to tell you loads of different ways to use it.\" Like it was the same with with these Runes right? Yeah, like here's all these different ways to play it so good.",
