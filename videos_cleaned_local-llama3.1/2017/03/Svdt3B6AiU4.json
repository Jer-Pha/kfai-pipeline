    "description": "PS4 has outsold Xbox One by 2:1+, and the distance between the consoles is likely to widen. This week's Colin Was Right is all about how PlayStation 4 found its mojo at a time when many thought console gaming was about to die, with a nod towards exclusive games.",

It's impressive that in just north of 3 years the PS4 has outsold GameCube by 33 million units, the original Xbox by 31 million units, and Genesis by 25 million units. All consoles on the market longer than PS4, some by a gap of several years. What's more impressive is that it's now a few million consoles ahead of Super Nintendo, only 8 million or so behind the original NES, and within Striking Distance of entering the top five bestselling consoles of all time. That's no joke, by the way; that's really esteemed company to be in \u2013 we're talking about PlayStation 2, PlayStation 1, Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360. PS4 will never surpass PlayStation 2, and it's unlikely to even reach Wii and PlayStation 1 numbers, but the fact that PS4 will rub shoulders with any of those five consoles is staggering. Remember, console gaming was left for dead about 5 years ago; many developers foolishly abandoned core markets for social and phone gaming. Publishers invested big money in those",

Publishers invested big money in those same markets and everyone misread the tea leaves. PS4 was supposed to be a modest success at best instead it's proven many prognosticators wrong. You know how the Wii U failed to take off, that was basically the expectation for all consoles moving forward. It's also important to remember that the PS3 and Xbox 360 era lasted forever, likely doing no insignificant part to the financial crisis and the reverberating shock waves it sent through the larger economy. Companies weren't investing, people weren't spending, and the generation was artificially extended. The SNES was on the market for 5 years when N64 came to store shelves, PS1 lasted a similar amount of time, PS2 6 years, how about PS3 7 years, Xbox 360 8 years. These consoles had time to burn there was pent up energy for something new sure but the thing",

These consoles had time to burn; there was pent-up energy for something new. Sure, but the thing is, PS4 could do PS3 numbers in half the time. This level of unexpected commercial dominance has been sustained for multiple reasons. For starters, PS4's announcement in February 2013 was nothing short of masterful, doubling down on core gamers who were becoming increasingly disaffected by a wholesale move to mobile and social gaming they never endorsed \u2013 it was a stroke of genius. Sony was targeted and on point with its messaging, which was substantive. PlayStation 4 got off on the right foot, and though we've had evidence this was important in the past, we got definitive proof because Xbox One stumbled out of the gate, and as I argued last week, while it's a great console in its own right, it's never recovered from the Don Mattrick era, and it never will.

The fact is, the biggest games are most naturally going to be the most attractive to the widest potential audiences Call of Duty and Destiny have sold and will sell more PlayStation 4s than Sony's exclusives combined ever will, and those games will healthily outsell even the most stunning of PS4 exclusives without much of a fight.

The interesting thing is that it was never clear Sony would win here either. Sony had a borderline asinine amount of exclusive support on PS3, specifically in the A and AAA realm, but rarely did one of those games truly break into the mainstream. Meanwhile, Sony's exclusive suite of PS4 games, while fewer in number, were slow to market and often underwhelming in the console's first two years. This went for both internally developed first-party games and second-party exclusives Killzone: Shadow Fall and Infamous: Second Son were both good games but neither were top-tier fantastic experiences coupled with the disappointing",

Coupled with the disappointing Knack, the chronically late and perpetually broken Drive Club, and the epic letdown that was The Order: 1886, it didn't seem like Sony was preparing a competitive slate of must-own PS4 exclusives. Nor did it seem to really matter either; after all, the PS3 had exclusives up the wazoo, but only the hardcore cared, and the PS4 was selling huge numbers without any critical darling exclusives. But then things changed, and it turns out that this change matters a great deal. Sony may have missed the early mark, but it wisely planted seeds all along that merely took time to grow, as seeds sometimes do. Interestingly, it was two second-party AAA exclusives launched in 2015 \u2013 Bloodborne and Until Dawn \u2013 that got the ball rolling. The former showed Sony's astute understanding of its error in letting the Souls franchise get away.",

The former showed Sony's astute understanding of its error in letting the Souls franchise get away at its embryonic state, while the latter showed a dedication to a completely novel concept and play style. Both were hugely popular with PlayStation 4 audiences, and that was only the beginning. 2016 gave us Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, two phenomenal games that sold extremely well. Later in 2016 came The Last Guardian. Early 2017 brought Gravity Rush 2 and the fantastic and unique open-world game Horizon Zero Dawn. And this doesn't even include all the vital third-party and externally published exclusives either, ranging from Nioh and Tales of Berseria to Persona 5 and near aom those aforementioned first-party seedlings will be sprouting in the coming years in such a way that momentum should be sustained especially when combined with all the third",

Days Gone, Spider-Man, God of War, The Last of Us Part II, Death Stranding, Gran Turismo Sport, Dreams, Detroit: Become Human, and more are still in the pipeline. All that is music to the ears of current and prospective PS4 owners alike. I think we can all agree that last week's video on Xbox One was mostly positive and entirely fair. So you may be wondering how and why the PS4 video is even more positive. I think the response to that inquiry is fairly evident: PlayStation 4 is a better console than Xbox One, with a better library. A console doesn't outsell its competition by more than 2 to one if it's not doing a lot of things right. That's",

It's just to say that PlayStation 4 has had a great run so far, and the next few years are looking great too, especially when you throw the potentially positive effects of PSVR and PS4 Pro will have on the ecosystem. If Microsoft wants to replicate Sony's success in the next generation, then I simply say do this: do exactly what Sony's already done, because it's a formula that works and works well.
