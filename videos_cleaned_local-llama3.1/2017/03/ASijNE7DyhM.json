Yeah, make the image and I'll do something crazy with maybe now that we have Andy, we can just tell him to do everything. Yeah, we can well we can ask him; he's here already, no why isn't he here? I want Andy here. We'll already have made the image, put he won that's true. No um anyways you can do the Twitch Prime thing that I'm sure you know if you've ever watched the show.
