While we had this meeting, like, this would have been great to sit here 10 years later and still be here, but dreams change and things change, and you want to go in different directions and do different things. And I think as you see Colin appearing on The Rubin Report and Glenn Beck, and all these different things, he's going in an awesome direction. We're 150% behind him, we fully support him entirely. We want him to go do what he wants to go do, and we want that to be successful. And whenever he does what's next for him, you can bet your ass we're going to talk about it here on the Kinda Funny Morning Show, and he's going to come on Game Over Greggy and promote it if he wants to, and stuff like that.

So I'm happy about that. And I mean again, and that's the thing - people I know, both in good context and bad context, like this fundamental change is kind of funny, and the shows are going to have to change. You're a th% correct, Colin is a co-founder of this company; he always will be. Colin was a lynchpin of this company, and he always will be. I don't think we crumble without him - that's, and he hopes we don't crumble without him. Um, I think it's going to be a while for us figuring it out, though. You know what I mean? We've talked about it so we'll cycle in different guests; we'll do these things. But eventually, how do we find another host, and who do we want to bring on, and stuff to that effect?

But think about it this way: if here's the immediate problem we learned this I think the hard way and I put 'hard way' in quotes of being at IGN when we left IGN right, we announced we... we started talking with them about leaving in September, finally in October we're like, 'We're officially leaving but we'll stay on through January 5, 2015.'

With Colin Moriarty all right, Colin, we're going to do this; you're going to stay on and you are going to work through Kinda Funny Live or through the year, whatever you want to say - two more weeks, four more weeks, right? Suddenly does Colin have to then second-guess everything he wants to say? Is he going to be worried about us not agreeing with him on that? Is it because it's not the tweet Colin wants to go be a political lightning rod? He's awesome at it; his opinions are great, but as we saw on Wednesday when that happens, it draws down fire on all of us in the company that we don't... I mean, I'm not even going to get back.

So anyways, to answer your question in the long run about why, is that would I think we thought that would and Colin agrees that would have made more complications and that would have gotten more awkward. And when Colin wants to do something or say something, and then he either has to worry about what's going to happen to us, we have to worry about it's just why keep doing this over and over and over again when we know this is what's going to happen. It's never going to be easy there's never going to be a plan that of okay okay we've hit this that and the other so now this all makes sense again I'd rather do it this way.
