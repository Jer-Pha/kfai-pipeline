First question comes from Joshua's steel, he says where does Pok\u00e9mon need to go as a franchise move on from mobile and focus on switch? Well here's the thing when you say mobile I'm assuming you might know I think you mean okay so it's like I this is a tough question to answer sure I think that Pok\u00e9mon needs to keep going on actual mobile, the Pok\u00e9mon Go obviously that's a success if they can find a way to get a Pok\u00e9mon game in this style of Super Mario Run or Fire Emblem Heroes where it's like alright we're gonna take this franchise and mobilize it in a way that is",

Having said that, I am NOT a hardcore Pok\u00e9mon fan; I couldn't tell you all the differences **** with all who's the latest gens and all that. But when it comes down to it, like I had a really good time with Sun and Moon because it was way different than what I expected in terms of story progression and there weren't gyms, and they did a lot of stuff where it it wasn't what I expected, which was more kind of EA Star Wars-like. It's like, hey, it's just it with different Morgenstein yeah, like ironically to me the oh it's the Aloha version it was the first time I was like, \"Oh no, that the Aloha **** is actually just the locations different but the entire thrust of the game is different because of that.\"",

Having said that, I still want more. But you're right \u2013 like these games every time they come out, they sell millions and millions of copies each. When you combine them both, because they are essentially the same game, they're gonna tank on the NPD forever, yeah? You know, for the entire console's life cycle. So we're in a weird place now because traditionally with Pok\u00e9mon, it's you get the two versions, and then within two years, you get the third version. A couple times, we've seen little change-ups with that \u2013 like Black and White; there was Black and White 2 instead of Gray, yeah, whatever. In this case, it's Gray's of... shitty call it whoa, Wow. But then then we also see the remakes that have started \u2013 we have the remakes of Red and Blue, then we have the",

So and then Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword I think also fall into that. Where it gets interesting is then there's the 2D Zelda games like the top-down Zelda games, and even those kind of have their own thing. Then there's the touch side with Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, but I think that link between worlds did to 2D Zelda games what Breath of the Wild did for the 3D Zelda games to a lesser extent. But being able to kind of buy your weapons whenever you want and it opens up the world - you can kind of tackle it how you want to from a top-down perspective, I think that that could be really interesting for a Metroid game as well, kind of just drop that bomb where it's like what if you're you're playing Metroid and it's not they'll",

Asked for something about that seems off and weird to me that does mean sucks but you figure that it makes sense right it does because you figure let's talk about means of production right that it's like it's so many people have the ability to make a disc so it's cheaper there's this different places to go to depending on what we actually who you work with different places to go to and do it works with cartridges there's must be few people manufacturing these things yeah I mean it seems like something that would affect indie games the amount trying to go physical the most but it's",
