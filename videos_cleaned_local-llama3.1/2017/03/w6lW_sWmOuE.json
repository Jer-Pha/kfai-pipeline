And when it's targeting delayed even more, it was just like, \"Oh man, you're really not coming out on Valentine's Day? Like, serious?\" And now that's gonna be a vegetable. What happened if it came out at that time? It would have been eaten alive. But now it's coming out at the best time, which is one of them.

We can all agree Persona 5 is going to kill it; it's going to get great reviews. I mean, they are getting reviewed in Japan already, and we have a standard there. The only real thing of consequence that I'm seeing in early April is the release of Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana, but April 11th is obviously very different, with a very different audience and very different type of game. I don't know the MSRP of Ys VIII, can you look that up? I want to say $40; I'm just putting my prediction there because I think we'd ever let's play it. We talk about our predictions for what games will do well in the next few months, and Nick and Greg dare me to make a prediction for a game called Ys VIII. My god, I did that!

I'm like you know it had a Kickstarter and it's had a long story and it looks really polished but it's just like where what is the market for 3D platforming games? I feel like this happens every like two years where another one of these comes out and we're like trying to see if it's going to kick off and then I just don't know.

It's like if it was a bit more of just like an actual platformer, like a more of a Ratchet & Clank-like game. A digression: Clank had its moment, and I'm like going back with Jack, exactly remember stuff where those are so good, and I loved when the Ratchet & Clank came out last year and it was fantastic. The ukulele thing for me is where I'm like \"I might give it a shot\" because even though I don't really love and have them installed for the Banjo type games, like I feel like it's coming at a good time for me in terms of having the Switch and where I'll be out.",

They're at that stage already. I just go talk video games in general, we've all been burned so many times, and I'm not even mentioning Zelda right now or Nintendo, but Zelda can't move in Grand Theft Auto some point it does become talked over you, but I mean yeah they're coming in hot on the Silicon Studios like they're still adding in the online stuff, like a lot of stuff that was supposed to launch got pushed out.

I don't know one that I think there was really great buzz behind it and I'm not just joking around calling it an early bird special of all that stuff, but there were other people that I saw who are moving that thing. You know, I mean, I remember when we brought it to the office and when he was there, Invince was there. People are standing up, gathering around like holy **** this is awesome.
