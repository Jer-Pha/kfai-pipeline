Which did you end up playing? Emily was why we watched a little bit of the playing it. We're like, \"As Emily is Number One's biggest fans,\" Tim and Greg don't need to play Emily. We'll get to that second. AP Out, I would say that is the Kinda Funny Games game of the show. Game of the show, AP Devolver because man, Devolver Digital - it's coming at PC and PS4.

I got a whole bunch, yeah, not a whole bunch but I got some semblance of this one we stopped at. We got a very short demo from it, but it was a call back to the developer Ben had emailed me, and his subject line was \"An African Team Fat Game Dev at PAX East.\" Like, clearly a real fan who knew what it was. And so the idea with Semblance is that it's a platformer, but it's a world deformer. So you have this line, you look like a simple Gumdrop, and you go through, and they'll be like, \"You know, you need to get up to this block or whatever it is here.\" But the platforms are here, and you jump up there, and you can't get up to that platform that you need to get to. So you go underneath, you jump up into the platform that's above you, and you make like... so it'll kind of pump it up so that you can get your head a line, and yeah, you can then",

Um, it's still in active Dev; it's PC only for now. Gotcha! The one I want to give a shout out to is Badass Hero. Now here's what I'm going to say, and this is a tall order, but stick with me, you, the listener/viewer. We've had it come up a bunch with Colin and I on PSL on this show where we talk about how Rogue Legacy ruined Rogue likes for us. Right? Because every Rogue like that comes out, you play, you're like, \"Oh great,\" and then I hope it's like Rogue where I die, and I can take whatever my progress is in some respect and make myself stronger.

Awesome, I got a couple more I want to talk about. There's one called Dimension Drive; it's uh, one of those vertical scrolling shooter games where you're in a little jet or what spaceship going up the screen right and like, like shooting things and kind of like a Bullet Storm bullet hell type thing, uh, but the screen is split in two and you have two ships going up at once, but it depends on what dimension you're in; so one's a parallel dimension to the other, a parallel dimension, you're only actually like",

It was always the Q&A would be led off by what did you see, you know? I mean, and we would still do it, and then it was but what was the coolest thing you saw, and people stopped asking us that a few years ago because we moved to this entertainer vibe where it is like this year we had the one panel and the pre-activation, and that was like those were our responsibilities, and so to have time to walk the floor was great, but it was also",
