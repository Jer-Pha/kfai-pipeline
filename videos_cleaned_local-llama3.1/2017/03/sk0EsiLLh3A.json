Like now it's easy to see her at the Nerdist and meet it kind of funny and be like oh well they both came from IGM and they host stuff together all the time. Like I was, you know, rookie editor and like I worked my way up while Chobot was there. But like it that was still when they were like, 'We're not putting editors on camera.' You know what I mean?

I get I go to brunch with Blair when he comes to San Francisco, but Jess is always not here for business. So like to do stuff and work with her again. Yeah, it was great. We had a good chemistry. Mike Ducker wrote the script. We were I was able to finagle him a job in there.

So when we got to the shrine that day and we were walking up and I was on the phone about something, I looked up and it was like, you know, fourtory tall banners for Final Fantasy Versus XIII. I was like, \"Fuck, right, this is a real thing.\" Well, what's the worst that can happen? Oh, it could be Mr. Caffeine from E3. **** we could really **** this up if we were not paying attention.

We did a whole topic about how award shows aren't that great. And god damn it. Like, you know what I mean? And that was the thing of like Well, I mean, I think that's what's what's awesome, though. So, we did the Final Fantasy thing.

Do you guys... And we were able Let me step off the stage and preach about Vita. Yeah. You made fun of them not for putting games on Vita and the games that you they put on Vita. You like gave extra attention and like people got it cuz that's us and we made jokes about Mr. Caffeine and E3 and got to do all that and it was cool because that was a different skill set that we don't get to exercise that much.

And you brought up the topic that we did about the award shows and all that stuff and how they can be bad and whatever. It's like these things are hard. there's a level of corniness that you can't get away from and like there's certain things that need to happen in order to keep the thing moving, right?

It's not cuz they don't like us. They're listening intently. And that's my whole thing where I always do the joke, right? When we do a thing of like who's ever been to a panel before and anybody raises their hands like you were at a bad panel, don't raise your hands. You're not allowed to. You have to cheer. You have to clap. You have to boo. You can do whatever you want. And we do like what if I say this, what if that happens, right?

This is great blah blah and it wasn't just the lip service thing. They were calling out specific jokes. They were telling me stories, but like two or three people were like, I think including John Drake were talking about the fact of the best parts were when we had lived and they would do the thing where they looked back like the whole Superman 64 thing goes on and I'm yelling at show about stopping me like that's not scripted line for line, right?

We could use your help if we could get it.\" Um, you guys have some big ideas. I love that. Uh, if you watch the DICE awards, I believe it was on their last award, Neil Druckmann made a reference that, you know, yeah, Nolan North was supposed to be there, but he had missed his flight. Literally, the show ends, we all come out. Uh, Jen was taking photos with some friends, and Nolan comes up out of breath. And I just hugged him like, I'm so sorry. He's like, \"I missed my flight got cancelled, this happened, I had to switch off two cabs,\" and he just totally missed everything. And then I introduce Nolan to Jen. Great. No big deal. Blah blah. We end up at the party hours later and uh I'm talking to Nolan again and Jen comes over and she's like, \"Oh, hi. I'm Jen.\" And Nolan just looks at her. I'm like, \"This is Nolan North. You just met him.\"",

Uh, yeah, it was there's those moments in my life where we get to work with so many cool people and we know all these cool people, and I'm in awe of all our developer and voice actor friends and all these different things. But to be sitting there and I'm talking to Nolan, and then uh some of the Naughty Dog guys showed up, and then like Shuhei Yoshida popped over and then Mike Balfrey was here, and I'm like popping back and forth and blah blah, and eventually I was talking to Nolan, and I think he was talking to Naughty Dog, and I was like \"Mike, I'm like yeah blah blah,\" and he's like, \"That's Nolan North,\" and I'm like, \"You don't know Nolan North?\" And he's like, \"No,\" and I'm like, \"Oh, so sorry.\"",
