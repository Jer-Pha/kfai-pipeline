They offered me a job, and Jeremy was the first editor I ever worked under, so you should know all that information since we are very close, so maybe we're just lying to you today, I don't know. Yeah, I I remember that time well too because you were so eager, you were so excited to to work at IGN, and just you super into Mega Man just as much then as you are now, uh. And I remember, I think the first review we assigned you was the Mega Man Legacy Collection, yeah.

If you guys have 29 million players, which by the way is really impressive, even though that includes PS+ players who got it for free - all those that's a quarter of the MO of the copies that Minecraft is sold; that's not a joke, that's a significant seller, more than Infinite Warfare will sell.
