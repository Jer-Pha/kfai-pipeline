I'm a fairly relaxed person, and I don't really get annoyed by many things since but for me it's when a person asks another person to communicate for them because they can't do it. example this is in quotes: Greg wanted me to tell you that he feels uncomfortable when we go see our rated R movies. I find that on principle rude and kind of messed up if I'm friends with someone, I want them to come to me whenever there's something up and we'll make it work and hash out any problems that and not involve more people what's yours so in short what pisses you off everyone at",

There was not an ET cartoon from the last topic, that sounds like fake facts from Kevin. When I think about things that truly make me angry, there's only really one word that comes to mind - don't say it, Kevin. That word is Kevin. Yeah, we all knew it was coming. God bless. Yeah, Kevin just has the ability to annoy Joy so much this show and everything with these people um God man I don't have things that like make me rage that much these days but the things that do piss me off like there's one thing that's been pissing me off a lot lately here we go Uber Uber drivers yes there's too many bad Uber drivers here and every time I take one I swear to God it's like the person's first day driving not for Uber just in general like the first time they've ever actually driven",

And I'm like that's funny because there's an email that just came out like a week ago that said \"Hey, dogs aren't allowed in this building because there's no pets allowed in this building for the owner's request.\" Right, which is exactly why me and my wife live there cuz we don't want to live near dogs. And the guy's like \"Oh, don't worry I got to work around,\" I'm like \"How are you getting a dog?\" The guy's like \"Oh, I got one of those um emotional support things.\" Those, I I just apply for an emotional support animal thing so they can't say no anyway.

That there are people out there that are just abusing it because they want a dog - mind you, he got a Siberian Husky. Those are very supportive animals. In his studio apartment with his girlfriend, so I'm like well maybe it's not going to last that long cuz at some point someone is gonna implode. Um, so that's just one of those things where I'm like I it just especially in the city where everyone's living on top of each other people are so selfish these days and they just don't give a **** about anyone else it seems like.

Nothing makes me more angry than just work not working the way you're supposed to. **** Work! Mhm. This is what you do: you have one job. Yeah, you don't do it. It's never that easy. Never. The thing that like drives me nuts is we're in a group of people, like usually it's at my apartment and we have people over whatever, and someone inevitably is like, \"Hey, can I get some more information?\" or makes some sort of comment outside where you know what they want you to do is ask more questions.

I've been trying really hard in the last year and a half, I would say, to like not get ratcheted up because I go from zero to 60 when it comes to things that just... I'm like \"this should be solved by now.\" We have talked about this so many times and I'm just so upset.

And it's just like I what upsets me is when people do not take a step back and be like what's the best way to communicate how I'm feeling right now to others, and it gets hard between especially like thinking about us in this sure in this bu like you hate technology which then means you don't communicate well to us, which means we're all upset.
