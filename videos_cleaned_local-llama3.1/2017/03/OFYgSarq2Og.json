Oh, is it? I thought it was a cool Greg move; well, it's definitely a cool Greg move. And then next comes a package, oh, from one and only Clayton Speller. Clayton Speller, you might remember, came to this morning show said he had something and he was going to send it in.

But let me give you a brief refresher before you charge once more unto the breach: first things first, Valkyria Revolution is not a sequel to The Valkyria Chronicles series; it's a spin-off. It takes place in a whole different timeline continent and universe than its predecessors, but familiar elements such as the precious material Ragn and the legendary beings known as the Valkyria make an appearance.\"",

Instead of a World War II influence, this game is inspired by the European Industrial Revolution and focuses on a war of Liberation between two vastly different nations. But arguably the biggest difference is the battle system: the turn-based action has been replaced with faster-paced but no less strategic combat. This hybrid battle system combines the tactics of customizing squad behavior and loadouts with squad-up, never roll out, for some pretty intense moments on the field.
