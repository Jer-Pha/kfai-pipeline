Yeah, I know what you mean, chief. Um, um, this came from I'm reading a book by Tim Ferriss right now called Tools of Titans and it came from one of his interviews that he did on his podcast where one of the people was talking about how they would write down 10 people they want to be friends with and then 10, 10, 10 ways to be friends with those people, like things that steps they can take to be friends with those people.

Like, I once met Adam Sessler, and he was on a press line, and he totally tore into some guy from CNN who was taking a picture of him while he was being interviewed by someone else. And I was like, \"That's sad; that sucks.\" But you know what they say: \"Heroes Die Hard.\" Damn, I like you so much. Don't don't don't. We're going into a topic next week about Jeff. All right, um, anyway, my point is that I think that you can sort of create circumstances in which your sphere intersects with the sphere of a person that you are hoping... well, I mean, me following Adam Sessler didn't do anything; it just made him be really scared, exactly.

That's where the difference lies is when I can walk into a room and just feel absolutely comfortable not talking to people and sitting there, then I'm like, \"We're friends, you know?\" So but then that begs the question right, like can...can that...it's it's a little hard especially in our industry where you know you do have to kind of always be on and you're always you're always sort of like",

And I, I so often think about myself on the other side, like we're talking about how oh I want to be friends with that person when somebody wants to be friends with me, like what works, what do I appreciate? Because there's so many times when you just get that feeling, and especially people listening to this are like \"oh my God, that's what I want to do\" to those guys next time I see those guys at one of their live events, I'm gonna use those tactics. And it's like no, don't use tactics.

Yeah, and like I even it's it's hard to think everybody you never reach a point where you're always comfortable with doing that. Like I feel like you're in situations where you still feel like what should I say? What is the best thing to say? And I think that it's like that is really when it comes to friendship versus uh networking versus whatever. I think the only time that you shouldn't do that is if you have a very direct goal, a network goal or a thing of I'm trying to come off a certain way or whatever. I think an example is at RTX Australia, like uh we were in the same room with Hideo Kojima it was an event, whatever and like I want to take a picture with him but I didn't want to be the one to go up to I like Greg can you introduce us, whatever and it's like I felt like in that situation that was the right way to go about that instead of just blurting it out and and whatever.",
