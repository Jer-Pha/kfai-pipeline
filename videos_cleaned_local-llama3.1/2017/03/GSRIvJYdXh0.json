Hey hey Nick, this is my friend Dino. Hi Dino, how's it going? Good, I'm very well. I just noticed you guys took off your snakes and I'm still wearing mine. We were worried that the snakes were going to interrupt the audio experience of this here let's play. Oh okay, so we... I put my snake right here. Sure what' you name it? I haven't named it yet. Should we should we come up with maybe Arnold? I want to call him Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold, CU. He reminds me of that big ass anaconda in uh uh Conan the Barbarian thing chops its head off and steals jewels. That's what starts all the action happening in the movie, and James Earl Jones is like yo that's not cool. And then we have Ahkmed and the other dudes that kind of look like Arnold come after him and they start like fighting. That Arnold... I'm going to name my snake Conan Britain. You know why?",

Then I want Nick to play on hard, okay, we can do that too, that's not a problem. I'm fine, I'm a master. So what is Snake Pass? Snake Pass is a 3D physics-based puzzle platform where you control a snake and the snake's name is Noodle. Is that the first time you've ever said that because that came off the top of your head very quickly? Yeah, thank you very much. This entire week basically. That's on PS4, yes, Xbox One, that's right. Swit is what we're playing it on as well, yeah, everywhere if you're one of these dorks with your mouse and keyboard all right so here but you can't control it with a mouse and keyboard. Oh wow, you're already thinking like a snake right now. So like that yes now see I'll Now kill that bird, kill that bir that's your homie that's",

Yes, now see I'll kill that bird, kill that bird, that's your homie, that's your homie. Saw the bird, it's all in the head movement looks exactly exactly. And the interesting thing is like the mechanics that we um implemented in Snake Pass is emulates what a snake actually does as well when it's like single muscle muscul and everything like that. Actually it came from an internal game Jam that that guy over there Seb Loeb go, the thing, go up the thing. Yes I'm go up the thing, I'm doing it, I'm going thing Jump On In, Jump On In.

It's okay, you have to go back, no, go forward, go forward, it doesn't matter - you can play any way you want in this game. It's all about playing at your own pace, there are actually no enemies in the game at all. Yeah, it's all about navigating the environment hazards that are in the game, and that's fun more than anything else. And of course, Nick is going to struggle with the mechanics here - I'm keeping track, but I clearly am not listening, guys have made him repeat himself twice already. But yeah, can you eat that thing? No, there are no enemies, but you can change your snake's behavior just like in Snake Planet - actually, if you use the d-pad, it makes him little and sneaky, and happy, and he's got a special move if you press it multiple times.\"",
