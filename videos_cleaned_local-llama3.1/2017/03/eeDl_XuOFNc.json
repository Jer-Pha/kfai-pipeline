You smell good. I like you, Kevin. I really appreciate your honesty right now. You're welcome. It's wrong, but what you're saying, Kevin smells bad. I am saying Kevin smells bad. I'm saying we all have days where we smell bad; that happens. We do stink sometimes. Kevin smells delightful. I think it's a misconception that Kevin smells good. I'm going to go over there right now and smell him. I'm sorry. Um, are you okay? Let's wait for this. How like how thoroughly are you going to smell me? I don't know if I feel comfortable with this. Smell his belly button; let me see what does his belly button smell like? He's getting everywhere. Yeah, he smells good. That is a good-smelling cup. Tim, why don't you come smell me?

And there's lots of new studies being linked to, like, sugar being the number one cause of, like, death in America because it's causing obesity, it's causing diabetes, it's causing all these things, heart disease, things like that. Um, so just those things - those things blow my mind. And in that, I started you know when you start reading a little bit more about that, you start reading things like that, you just don't even think about, like the number one thing that always blows my mind is, like, always well, I'll ask you guys this: corn - vegetable or grain?

Should I not eat corn 'cause I love corn? You can eat corn, but it's the same as eating a piece of bread; is it really if you think about it? So when I get corn at Chipotle every day, I got corn today too, yeah, no, I mean obviously, pieces of bread are in it, it's got sugar and flour, it's better for you than that, but corn, same thing, I mean cornstarch is a derivative of corn, right?

You can't put it in the vegetable group; it has to go with Breads and everything else, and flowers. I don't like that one bit - I don't like the pyramid; I don't like that thought. Oh, the pyramid... that's a common misconception - the pyramid sucks. No, the common misconceptions of the pyramid is what you should abide by, which is again they moved it to the prism now, right? Is it the prism upside down? They **** a whole weird **** but just **** like that, right? Like the peanut - The Peanut, the peanut Bean, right? Nut or legume; it's a legume, right?
