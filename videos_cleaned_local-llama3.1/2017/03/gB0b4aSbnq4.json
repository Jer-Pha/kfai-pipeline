I give myself at least 25 seconds on that and then I made the mistake of saying I needed challengers on The Morning Show so I challenged Nick to see if he wanted to challenge me, and then I said you could pick the one-two Switch game, and I thought we'd do the Milking Game, I thought we'd do something, and he immediately stopped on the Yoga One, and I forgot that he does yoga. Am I allowed to point out that you're judging all of Nintendo World Championship based on one Switch? Is that well, we it's rotating, it's gone up in Mario Kart; there was multiple back-and-forth with some Mario Kart 8. No, there's never there's no back and forth, I always had it through that.
