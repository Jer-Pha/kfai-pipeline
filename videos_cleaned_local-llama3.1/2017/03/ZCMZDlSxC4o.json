I think it's cool, I really liked The Division a lot, and I feel like this game's obviously in a similar vein; um, obviously is noisier than Soft game different team and different IP; um, but yeah, I like it. I think that the production value is really high, I like that the storytelling in the game I think is really cool - it's a very deep kind of gamey in the sense that it's a deep criminal tree that you're kind of trying to dissect in the game and they introduce everyone and there's a lot of actual like um if you want to find it there's a lot or go through it there's a lot of exposition in the game about what you're doing and who these people are and why they matter to this drug organization",

Yeah, Kevin and I did six hours with Wildlands, uh, here we were playing with subs, so every hour we switched in two different subs, uh, and I'm I echo Colin to an extent, like I mean that was my playing, I was like no this is not as good as The Division, like I really loved The Division, I loved our let's play, we went and did of it and stuff, and that gameplay still there, that's that goofiness is still there, but I feel like the game is almost so grounded and so like all right cool it's this military thing we're doing this thing we're out there for this operation, that where it there's no not excitement to it, but there's no pomp and circumstance to we're The Division, yeah, all right we're fighting cleaners who are guys walking around with flamethrowers",

That was a really fun mission that stands out, but the rest were for me personally I felt like all right cool there's this giant thing in there we're going to hack the guy's computer we're going to do this and so you kind of approach it all from the same way whereas The Division is all in New York but the variety of the people you're facing I felt made it all feel different, like going from area to area. Unless you disagree, Kev, like on the map in uh Wildlands I didn't feel like I'm getting a new kind of creep, a new person I'm fighting, it's just another drug lord gang somebody who doesn't wear a shirt. Hey, I think for for me the the issue was that like I had no context, like I was just whoever was joining us would kind of take control and be like oh let's go here and so I I looking at the map every once in a while I'd be like how the hell are we in",

And like one of the reasons I did you know Nick made a joke of like because we didn't do the morning show this week because we're going to PS and you guys were in LA on Tuesday and I was supposed to be off on another adventure somewhere else making videos on Tuesday and Wednesday and so when it that when my thing fell through and I was like all right cool well you know Tuesday I'm just here like all right well let's do this. Nick made a joke, like oh man if I had a day off I wouldn't like do this.

But it is that thing of like, it's cool you know we're taking helicopters up and jumping out and parachuting and being stupid idiots, but it is a game that is meant to be played more precisely. It's E3 exactly where you are - like I'm trying to sync shots and I hit X and a tutorial popped up and everybody got their shot and I didn't.
