So awesome, they're basically giving something that's better than the equivalent of their top pledge here. So not too shabby, good job internet coming out supporting each other. Doing everything like this is going to be it soon enough, I guess. And hopefully they'll have pretty good servers okay good, I hope so.

Uh, first story is a very interesting one in terms of what we always end up talking about here. If we keep talking about the Oculus eventually it's got to be free. Facebook is planning a $200 Oculus in 2018 apparently this is via Bloomberg I'm going to read two paragraphs of their stories. Uh, currently VR hardware comes in two flavors: cheap headsets that turn smartphones into virtual reality players like Samsung's $130 Gear VR and high-end gaming rigs like Facebook's $400 Oculus Rift that hook up to $1,000 plus desktop computers. Facebook's new headset is designed to bridge that gap - a device that will sell for as little as $200 and need not be tethered to PC or phone according to people familiar with its development it will ship next year and represent an entirely new category like current Oculus products the new headset will be geared toward immersive gaming\"",

The new headset will be geared toward immersive gaming, watching video, and social networking, said the people who were asked not to be named in the discussion of the private matter code-named Pacific. The device resembles a more compact version of the Rift and will be lighter than Samsung's Gear VR headset, one of the people said. The device's designed features aren't finalized and could still change, but the idea is that someone will be able to pull their headset out of their bag and watch movies on a flight just the way they can now with a phone or tablet. Good stuff, crazy stuff. If you can get a VR unit out there for $200 or less, I think you're in a good spot; that's a perfect price point for holidays, birthdays, or like people just buying a bit of fun technology that they can use without anything else, and I think that's what's",

But she didn't leave thinking I'm going to go buy a PlayStation 4 and buy this thing and buy a camera and do these moves on you know, I mean it's just too much the barrier to entry, yeah for sure. And some of the best uh uses of VR that I've experienced on my PC has been stuff like Google Maps which re has that powerful feeling that you get from a lot of games but obviously it's not as meaty uh some uh bullet points I broke out here from the Bloomberg book story uh today, the global market for our headsets remains tiny in the first quarter.

I think that this was a smart move given it was coming out right after Assassin's Creed Origins, Super Mario Odyssey, Call of Duty World War II, and before Star Wars Battlefront 2. It would have been drowned out. January is typically quiet, typically quiet, and gives this game yeah I know it's much needed attention but I pose the question do you guys feel release dates have been getting announced way too early? I've been annoyed with this trend recently especially with Sony Ni no Kuni 2 was announced at PSX 2015 and now it's not coming till 2018. Sony first party is extremely guilty of this God of",

Sony first party is extremely guilty of this - God of War, Days Gone, Detroit: Become Human, Gran Turismo Sport, The Last of Us Part II, and Spider-Man are still not out. Other examples are Final Fantasy VII Remake, Kingdom Hearts III, in my goodness, where is Resident Evil 2 remake? Games shouldn't be announced three years before they come out - there's no reason for this, and it just frustrates gamers who hear nothing on something they're waiting for for a very long time. I feel companies shouldn't announce a game unless they feel it can be released within a year of its announcement. What do you think of this? Thanks for all your hard work and the great podcast each and every week - it's each and every day...

So I think probably Metal Gear Solid one is a solid one, I really like one a lot, um I love I love two, I only recently played three, like maybe like two years ago I went back and did it, um and I really liked five but I I completed it and then they were like oh was the second half to this game and I was like **** I'm out, it so ends act one like what the ****.
