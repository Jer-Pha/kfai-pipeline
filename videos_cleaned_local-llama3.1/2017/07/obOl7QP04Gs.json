What's up, Danny O'Dwyer? I'm full of energy this morning. Those donuts were gross. Don't say that. It's just seeping out of me. If you missed the Kinda Funny Morning Show, donuts from Seattle were delivered and they were huge and fantastic and you have a little bit of glaze right here on your shirt. It's flavor saver. I want to suck on that later. All right. You just lean right into it. Usually I'm the guy who does that. You do it. Danny, it's your first show of the week. How are you? Great. Real good. Uh played a bunch of games over the weekend. I was going to say, did you do your homework? We sent you off to play Fortnite. I did. You played it? I played Fortnite. What did you think? The video game that's out you can go play right now. Exactly. Imagine that. Um, yeah, that first of all, it is",

Um, so I had a \"Judge's Week\" and that was I like we didn't play it and I watched it and I was like, \"This actually looks cool.\" Like I'm not this guy. I'm not the base building multiplayer dude, but I was like, \"This looks like a cool game. It looks like it's got cool systems.\" And it is like like you said a base-building multiplayer game, but it's like kind of different to lots of them in that it's like it's not you're not really like it's not Minecraft in that you're building something and going back to it and tweaking it.

I tend to solo a lot of stuff and I think I'm probably not getting the most out of it that way, but if you're the type of person who like enjoys playing with your friends and just has an affinity for this sort of stuff, it it seems like purpose made for a certain type of person.

I love Super Giant Games. I respect them.

It's I should I think the reason I enjoyed Transistor so much is that I had not played Bastion, so I got all of that goodwill with it as well. Um, and I love Super Giant Games and obviously like I'm a huge fan of Greg Kasavin, used to be the editor of GameSpot. Um, huge like professional uh, you know, sort of hero of mine. Um, but I I do like this game. I I think the reason I tried Transistor is because I'm not really into that type of combat and I sort of enjoyed it.

It's like a three-person version of speedball. Okay. Um I like that like the the sort of sport part of the game. I do like the overworld aspect of it as well. Uh I like the story. I think the characters are really well um written and the art is just again incredibly incredible. And they make stuff pop.

Switch sales are insane. 4.7 million Switches have been sold since the March release. That's up 1.97 million in the first or the last fiscal quarter. Uh 3.54 million units of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in April release have been sold. That means 3/4s of Switch owners now own Mario Kart 8. That's absurd, right? It gets worse as we Hold on.

That means about 83% of Switch owners own The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Who's that 70%. They're just like, I'm good. I got I'm here for ARMS. I got Graceful Explosion Machine. Got a couple cool downloads on anything else. Uh amiibo sales have sold uh 1.6 figures uh 1.6 million figures this quarter. Downloadable games across all Nintendo platforms made about $98 million US. And then IGN says all that translates into good news for Nintendo's finances, primarily because of Switch's hardware and software sales.

But if I'm jumping in like, you know, I was I loaded up the Switch with like Cave Story Plus and a couple other different things and it was like, you know, jump cut to me on the plane was playing Minecraft again because I'm like, well, Minecraft looks great here and it runs so well and it's beautiful.

What do you What is the ceiling you think for the Nintendo Switch? Where is this going to plot out? I put on the rundown today. I went over to Wikipedia, got, you know, the top consoles right now. I was going to do top 10, but PlayStation 4 is at number 12 right now with 60 million. I was like, well, I'll include it there. So, that gives you an idea of where it's at, right? 60 million is PlayStation 4. NES is 61.91 million. Uh 66.12 for 3DS. And it goes on and on until you get to, of course, PlayStation 2 with greater than 155 million units moved, right? Yeah. Where",

Um, so like the interesting thing that's happening here is that we hardly ever see this happen with consoles in at least the sort of more modern era which is that um people are adopting it right now. Yeah. It's not like PlayStation 4 or Xbox One where there was you know the hardcore fans jumped in but then you had a lot of people saying oh I'll wait another 6 months until some extra games come out the library gets a little fatter um and I can enjoy it then. Same thing with the 360 definitely with the PlayStation 3. Um, this feels more like the DS which was selling like and kind of the Wii.

I think for like gamers or whatever, what I can never think of it. Core gamers or whatever, people who are into this sort of **** and will play like a game like Zelda Breath of the Wild. I think it's going to sell absolute hot cakes. It's going to do really well. The library is already there. No matter what, people will want to buy this thing to play Zelda even in 3 years time. Like I think it's when Mario Odyssey comes in, it's just going to become such like a easy buy because it's relatively cheap in comparison to a lot of the other consoles and the library is there.

And I think that's where it's like it's like a YouTube video where like it does well and then when it reaches a certain threshold, it just sort of goes ah and it enters the wider consciousness and then kind of does that, right? It's the same thing with these consoles and like they have been selling this very much as we're doing Nintendo stuff that Nintendo used to do and we've got new ideas and new people taking the stuff that you did like about Nintendo in the past and reinvigorating it.

And now we're going to try and get out there and get some new people. But I'm not really sure. The thing about Nintendo and what they're doing here is that Nintendo nostalgia runs so deep in the way that I think the biggest problem the Switch faces right now is the kink in its pipeline of production. Right? I think the fact that they've been able to do I'm just going to round up to 5 million Switches since March, right? That's basically four months since July when these numbers were or this is actually by the end of June, I guess, right? So, but you know, whatever four months we're going to say 5 million units, right? That's insane.",

So, but you know, whatever four months we're going to say 5 million units, right? That's insane. That means everything that's getting out is getting sold for the most part. And so if they can, as we get closer and closer to holiday, like the demand just builds and builds and builds. So every unit Nintendo is able to get out for the holiday is going to get snatched up. Meaning that I don't think it's beyond the realm of possibility that we cross with pretty ease. I would say 10 million by the end of the year if they can get it out. If they can get that additional 5 million, a little bit more than 5 million out there and get it, I think they'll sell them because I think there's enough of our audience that's like, I can't find it. I can't do anything. And then there's always the one kid who's like, well, here I am in Wisconsin at Walmart and there's a million of them. I'm like, well",

But content to DLC implies the content that I need the main game to play it. I feel weird when people say DLC is even wallpapers as well. To me, DLC is the g this is the main game and then you are basically adding add-ons to that game. Yeah, DLC is add-ons. Yeah, like that seems pretty clearcut. The expansion pack thing has way before the internet was even a thing, a distribution model was always a nightmare for this on PC games cuz you often had expansion packs where you needed the base game and then you often had them where you just they're",

It's a new game from the Saints Row developers Volition and is heavily based on G.I.

But like subsequent games are really good.

So, they've been really good at selling games that people might not necessarily be fans of yet. I like, I kind of think I don't want to write them off because like they have a brilliant lineage.

That's a really fascinating uh question from a person who also was involved in porting a game like Prison Architect to a console because that's the problem I think with the Sims is messing with keyboard controls. One of the ones I was talking about yesterday was Cities: Skylines coming to PlayStation 4 this August and I'm like I can't wait. I'm like but will it work?

You don't even you don't even stop to think that, oh yeah, like this came over from somewhere else super late changed this. Like I, you know, I think I put it on here.
