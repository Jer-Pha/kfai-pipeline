Yeah, I got a compound bow; I got myself not a compound bow, I got myself a recurve bow, like a very traditional-looking one. And then there's an archery range out in Oakland where you walk the shots like uh, like golf, like you do one shot to the next in the woods. It's really pretty; it's this wonderful little hike up there to meet my friends and just lose arrows - that's what we do most of the time. Cool, it sounds dangerous. The hills are set up so if someone's shooting, it's probably highly unlikely they'd hit you, highly unlikely. So I'll take those odds, yeah. Exactly. So yeah, it was just you know doing that. Do you ever act like Green Arrow? Do you ever do any stuff like that? So the range has rules about pointing up and stuff like that; me, like yelling, \"You failed the city!\" And then, \"Oh no! I jumped off things and shot...\" Have you nailed the little knee tuck? No, jeez. Every time I even did a jump, I mean...",

Yeah, okay, so it's an expensive habit when you're losing arrows all the time. Sure, yeah, yeah, sounds like fun though. We should do that; you guys should totally do it. It's surprisingly fun, yeah, and Kevin has both. Do you wear the whole like arm guard thing? Yes, you have to wear an arm guard because... okay, I'm sorry, why didn't mean ask stupid questions. Well, if you have a good like jacket or something, something to cover you up, cuz this one from our store, sure, that would probably do. But the string will it will rip your skin up, so yikes!

But at the same time it feels really good when you get it in a box. So I guess what I'm trying to say is... I'm sorry that you didn't get it. Um, Kevin, here's what I want to know from you from a technical side over there: do we have Marvel Heroes Omega on the PlayStation 4 Pro? Oh, I don't think so. I don't think so either. You want me to get that going no because it'll screw up your uploads and downloads. I'll just read a remote play, roll a few times, no big deal, no pressure. Let's see if I get it while...

Do we need a script for something?\" And I'm like, \"I can do that.\" This is like the work that I'm comfortable with. I'm still finding my feet in development, you know?

I'm thinking of another game designer, Warren Sapp is an NFL player, and then there's Warren Ellis, comic book writer, but the person I was thinking of is actually Warren Spector, game designer, who has worked on games like Deus Ex and Thief. Anyway, when I got my job and he said hello fellow game designer, I was like no don't say that I was like I haven't earned that yet exactly, like now I feel a little bit more comfortable with it but it was you know it was just like when I graduated from high school I thought",

High school did not prepare me, and so I went into game dev thinking, I know **** games this is going to be fine. I was like, oh no, I suck, and I have to start over. That was the **** up part about it. So similar question here from Doggy, what's been the hardest thing in Game Dev besides making doors explode? Uh, yeah, it's been it is learning how to accept that you're not going to get to make the thing great. Like I think for me a hard part of it was that coming from IGN and having a lot of my friends like you guys and stuff that would be like if I worked on something, you might give me help coverage or you guys might tweet it out.
