It's the speech that would be known as the Crisis of Confidence speech. Are you familiar with this? No, no one is familiar with this. Alright, so it's on July 15th, 1979. It's this long speech, and it's pretty much the president saying to America, \"Get it together.\" Like, everything's right now, and we...

We can see this crisis in the growing doubt and the meaning, a growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives, and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and political fabric of America.
