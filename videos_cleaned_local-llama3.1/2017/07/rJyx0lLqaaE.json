I'm like, dope. There's only five people in line and as you know they always do the thing where they're writing your name like what's your name? Nick. Nick, how do you spell it with an N? I'm like a K-N and I see K. Look down the line and there is no lie like 30 drinks and I'm like, **** cuz I only put 10 minutes on the meter and it's going to take longer than 10 minutes. Now I'm seeing other people do this by the way. People are dropping like flies. One woman was just like, \"Fuck it.\" and left. And I didn't see her come back. And trust me, I would have **** seen her come back because I was there for 30 minutes waiting for an iced coffee. I'm like, \"Yo, what's going on with the drinks?\" And the guy's like, \"I know. We're really backed up.\" And I was like, \"Well, dude, I've been here for 20 minutes",

Like, I got to go put this up, but if I get a ticket, it's going to be a $75 cup of coffee and that's not acceptable?\" The guy's like, \"I'm honestly sure I don't know.\" Hey, fix it. So, I'm like, I got to go get my meter. When I come back, I want to see my coffee here. Put money in the meter. Come back. The coffee is there. And the guy left me two like free coffee things. And I and in some stupid like stance, I grabbed my coffee and I said, \"You can keep those. I'm never coming back to Starbucks again.\" And I left. The biggest lie. And I went to Starbucks again that day.",
