Danny O'Dwyer, my Irish friend, Tekken 7, yeah, number one would not have predicted that, no, not at all, and I think it speaks to what we're always talking about in the same way Ghost Recon: Wildlands, yeah, the most popular there are so many micro communities that it's impossible to keep track of video games. And actually, here's what I think's going to happen, here's what's going to be the most important thing or how these games are going to do because like if you were to ask me, I would say and I know Kevin played it recently on a stream with me with Andy that Wildlands does have an audience.

I get Miguel de I mean as long as they keep selling Switches I feel like that game is going to keep selling as well and that's what I think's fascinating about if you want to talk about the Nintendo side of this, it's five six and seven our Arms Zelda in Mario Kart and you really do wonder what and I understand that like you.",

You can remember that like well, I mean based on this even what they're saying here, Breath of the Wild is moved in the number two spot, of course. But also the fact that like remember the attach rate that first start with it when they put it out, and it was that Zelda had sold kind of like a flash. You're wrong, right? It's sold I want it was more innocent or something, Zelda than there were Switches.

I didn't go because they're like, 'Can I do direct feeding like a let's play now?' And I'm like, 'Let's play? Want to get a life.' Yeah, and then he went and played it.

Alright, I got to make their own character for it. And also the news that Howard the Duck is in the game. We have not confirmed the role of are you really? Yeah, it was done.

It'd be more interesting. You have okay, our games, principally 2008's been out, so we're going to make a bundle on PSN and Xbox Live and Steam - that's all you'll see, all things for $10. Yeah, and be a way to combat sales that makes great sense, and that also is what they kind of do in retail with Game of the Year editions.
