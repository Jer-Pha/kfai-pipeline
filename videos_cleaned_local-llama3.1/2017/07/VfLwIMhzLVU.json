Today is the most hit person you hang out with, I feel like I know a couple of hit people. Cool Greg slapping on the street, he's hip on the streets. I don't know, Lisa Medina's pretty hip. Luis Medina is really Lou Medina - this dude, he's our like contact at Rooster Teeth. I'd say he's the hippest person I know; he probably is because he always knows things that I don't know.

You stole the Louis Vuitton pants; you wear them first off when you're not going to be on camera, but more importantly, when you fly, are you going to show people L Medina? Okay, just making sure. Uh, but the other day you went to look at glasses and tried on Louis Vuitton glasses, and then we're like, \"no, it's too much.\" Too much. Why is that? It just is. I didn't want glasses.
