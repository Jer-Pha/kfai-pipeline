Um, so I'm a I'm a psychiatrist, which means that I'm a medical doctor. I'm actually an osteopathic physician, which is just a little bit different school of medicine being that at some point in my life I knew how to treat somebody with my hands and of course as a psychiatrist I never do that anymore right? But every time I walk in, I'm like \"I hurt myself doing jiu-jitsu.\" You're like, \"What do you take?\" And I'm like, \"Yo, this means he likes not a bad thing.\" Right there was there was a moment in my past where I could have treated your back pain with these guys. Awesome. So that's the osteopathic side of things and or just the medical part. And so after you finish medical school we do residency, so we're talking like Grey's Anatomy season one at this point, and you pick what you want to go into, and so I elected psychiatry at that point.

And that opens the door to being able to help people through medication management but also psychotherapy, which is kind of where I have leaned in my career and just gotten the expertise and training in that piece. And so at this point, the iteration of how I help people or what my career looks like is really focused on those kinds of opportunities to work with people long-term more in-depth and being kind of the agent of change for their life that they're looking to get to rather than kind of exporting that out to another therapist.

I was too hungover to go and did you realize you were doing it for that reason? No, well me, okay, I don't think I was as quite as in touch with myself as I was back then, yeah, no, I am now, yeah. So so that happened and then flash four or five years later, I'm like, I really want this is when I moved up here for the job at IGN, I'm like, I really want to give us another shot, and there was that we had a free membership over at a Kevin what's that place it's not it didn't used to call up you know that place, like Lowe's, Mattata is that gym we used to go, thank you, yes, that's what it was, was Racket because we I used to love playing racquetball with my friends and one of the one time I walked in and I looked over and one",

So that was about two months of me figuring out ways to not go right, you know, get maybe once a week. And then I remember specifically they started teaching judo; I'm like, \"Oh, perfect,\" because judo is more about takedowns, more about throws. I'm like, \"Great, this is a way for me to stand up and if it goes to the ground, I only have to be there for two seconds before they send us back up.\" Which of course is not the best way to learn jujitsu; it's not by doing judo necessarily, and I wasn't sure how to do jujitsu right. So I think that then flash forward \u2013 that must have been when I was 26 or 27 \u2013 when flash forward 2017, I'm like, \"This is this problem now.\" I'm starting to get to a point where I can thinking about going back to it was getting me to a point where I was noticing that I was having high levels of anxiety and elevators.

You have to have given a person permission to exert that controller, that stimulus, into your life, and then you also have to have gone through the process of at least perceiving that you have learned the skills to be able to overcome it. And so that was our conversation when we first started developing your treatment plan. I mean, the first step that you did was to have you lying on the ground right on your back, and how we got there was by breaking down... you know, we could talk about so many different versions of claustrophobia, but the one that you have the most investment in was your tight spots with Jiu-Jitsu, and so we broke it down: what did it look like?
