I'm changing things a couple things that Netflix has done that that I want to talk about with you guys. One is uh can I talk to your manager, Netflix? Uh, excuse me, and go get your supervisor of Netflix right now. You've already done it wrong; you don't ask the question, you say \"go get your manager\" at Netflix. Netflix.

I like to just browse through for hours - it drives my wife nuts, but it's my calming happy time. Okay, Netflix has **** that up for me, but the most egregious, oh here, egregious of all, is the fact that they've done away with the five-star ratings now; it's just thumbs up or thumbs down.

Well then what's the point of me? I used to why was I think so? I've read both things though, I've read other things where it's like why yeah why rate it. I remember I remember doing that all the time going in there five-star four-star whatever. Yeah it's like it's like if you watch Family Guy a lot, you'll have a five-star rating for American Dad because it's people who enjoyed that also enjoy this.

Iron Man 3 is probably the worst - I'm IR Man 3 is not the worst, wayin your mic's up right, I I do not like actually I kind of really **** hate Iron Man 3 hold on everybody now the Iron Man to hate is Iron Man 2 no yes Iron Man no Iron Man 3 is one of and I here I will say this Kevin give me my the one work man come on here's what I'll say everybody is I know yeah I'm a DC fan boy and I play that up I enjoy the Marvel Cinematic Universe quite a bit I I enjoy it I go there and everything else Iron Man 3 is better than Iron Man 2",

Well, I'll start working on the fact that and I say, and I still say \"you know what I mean,\" but I think I now use it in a more appropriate manner. Doesn't matter is the fact that you know what I'm saying - you know what I'm saying - what you know what I'm saying? Uh, is the fact that what we do outside of this and outside of gaming necessarily right? Actually influences the content more than you think it would. Where and I think this is stupid, but throwing a party and cutting my hand, going to the movies, going out for burritos, and the mariachi band - all this different stuff is all dumb s***t to talk about. Whereas like it's right now, you know another good thing for in terms of perspective and work-life balance: get married, you know what I mean?
