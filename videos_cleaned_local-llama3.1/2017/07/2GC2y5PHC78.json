He noted that this version of Batgirl is still very much like the original Babs, not trying to be a \"bgirl\" (a play on the term \"superhero\") or emulate Bruce Wayne's style.

Vaughan was actually a headwriter on Seasons two and three of Lost and who this different one who should direct a Paper Girl show or movie I would think and I know it's old but Spielberg would be great because it it gives me that 80s Vibe that's what I want it gives you the Stranger Things vibe you know the guys from Stranger Things are probably the best they'd be really good at it too yeah U Brad Eric Murphy says Tim pick your favorite Articuno Zapdos or Moltres it's all made up stuff that's all just made up **** Zapdos I mean look at him Zapdos is the only cool looking one I like Articuno cuz he's blue but honestly Zapdos dude I think Moltres is kind of cool no Moltres",

CCX Speedster says Greg have you started reading jokes and riddles Arc for Batman and the Blockbuster story arc for Nightwing? If so, thought I haven't. I haven't downloaded, I'm ready to go on them but I haven't started into them. The war jokes and riddles seems like it'll be cool but we'll see who knows. And then one more here Hack 2112 any advice on where to start and getting into comics? Where to start uh I mean it really depends on if you're if you're looking for superheroes or just cool stories because if you're just looking for cool stories um what's it what's like a just a story, just a short story that at least a or like a volume one that is like a good thing like an Image Lock and Key man locking key we didn't I know you like locking",
