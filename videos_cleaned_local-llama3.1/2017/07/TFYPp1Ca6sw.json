Is this a new shirt? I don't not know if it is new. Do you wear it often? I just don't feel like I see it's in my monthly rotation. Not not weekly, not biweekly. Okay, yeah it's my boy The Cutting Linguist. Oh, I've heard of them - friends of no, they're all just related to Q15 in some way. Yeah, some way or form that's where it is. They are Q15, that's what I said. Thank you very much. Q15 God, I hate you all. What Q5? You ha Q5. I'm correcting him. Why you the problem for me is that it sounds so much like Chicago's Q101. Hold can you say that one more time? What never mind. I don't remember what I said. I don't have a problem with you. You said I love you. I do love you, and it was nice. Everyone knows that I do.

Yeah, well, it's like so the S is the water bath thing; the blowtorch is to cook the meat afterwards. Maybe maybe I bring some steaks on Sunday in my little soused machine. We're doing a stream all day on Sunday if you didn't know, getting ready for Kinda Funny Live 3's release. Hell yeah, we are. How you doing, Tim? I'm doing pretty well.

Star Wars canon dictates that all episodic films in the Lucasfilm franchise must begin with four things: first, the intro; a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away; and then the Star Wars logo accompanied by John Williams' bombastic score in the F; and finally, the crawl, as if gliding through space itself. A collection of carefully crafted bright yellow words float upward across the screen explaining what has happened and setting the stage for the upcoming action.

Okay, what did volume one and two? Yeah, okay, I loved it. Yeah, me too. Uh, this so far I think my favorite of the required readings. I like it better than Paper Girls and I liked it better than Lockjaw (corrected from \"locking key\"). There are a lot of similarities to Lockjaw. I thought there's certain times when I was reading it, the weird thing about doing this weekly comic required reading thing is that you only get a little bit into it and then you start off in something else. Yeah, and it threw me off 'cause there's a character that's very similar in Lockjaw and in this, and I was like, wait a minute, do I am I remembering this wrong? And I was telling Kevin earlier, like there's a lot of material in this, and I feel like every issue, like even though I read the graphic novel, you can tell where the issues start and end because everyone is so different.",
