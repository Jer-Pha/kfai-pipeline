Uh, the filmmaker is excited about remastering particularly, particularly according to Nolan, 4K is currently the best way to get uh the home video audience close closer to the 6K resolution his films were shot in, which is a little confusing to me - largely because I know he shot on film so I got to",

I didn't want people to have rose-tinted glasses on for Dark Knight Rises and a lot of them have gone back and watched them and tweeted me like you know what, you're right, that movie was bad, it was a bad movie with poor character motivations, bad fight scenes, nonsensical plot, mhm really stupid let's make sure no one goes out at night let's have all of this movie happen during the day let's put Batman in bright white lights and he's",

I think that The Dark Knight Rises has better moments in it but I think Batman v Superman is a better popcorn film cuz I think it just has it's just more fun to watch what moments from Batman from The Dark Knight CU like I'm saying again. I know this is the joke now there's a t-shirt about Batman v Superman. You can take Batman v Superman out of the equation, I think I walked out of The Dark Knight Rises before there was even a Man of Steel being like **** that was bad and it broke my goddamn heart cuz it was Spider-Man again where it was like oh Spider-Man 1's good holy **** Spider-Man 2 is **** awesome I can't wait oh my God Spider-Man 3",

I think he salvaged as much as he could but I liked that there was a few things that he did in that movie that actually were Batman-esque which is similar to the reason why I like a lot of the things from Batman: Superman.
