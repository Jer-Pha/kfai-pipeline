That's awesome, cool, and then my big question is Life is Strange: Before the Storm looking good, it looks excellent, you know I'm a big fan, I don't wanna screw it up. Was jarring not having Ashley's voice, Chloe no, the actress that they got is doing a really fantastic job of embodying that character. There's a full developer diary out now on the Square Enix website if you guys want to watch like in detail about her talking about taking on that role working with Ashly from a behind-the-scenes perspective.

And by saying that you would be doing a huge disservice to the game itself and to what Naughty Dog is trying to do with Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. Naughty Dog is pushing the industry standard for DLC, just like they did with The Last of Us' Left Behind. I'm just saying this guy's right now - we are seeing a studio evolve right before our eyes. And for those who are listening right now in the podcast, I do have some awesome Uncharted: Lost Legacy footage. If you're there listening right now or watching, don't worry guys, I won't have any kind of crazy spoilers, anything like that. I'll keep this impression as generic as possible regarding the demo itself. It happens right after the riverboat scene and you see Chloe Nadine; they pull up to this big, big area of the Western Ghats in Chapter 4.",

The best part about Naughty Dog's open-world is how simple, polished, and refined it is - not cluttered with crazy UI. When we open up the map, there's just nothing cluttered with all these icons and side-quests; everything has a purpose. Even the enemy NPCs have a purpose: they're either there to tell a little bit more of the story or they're just sleeping on the campsite, anything like that. I'd be amiss not to compare it to Ubisoft titles or Breath of the Wild - those are huge proportions, huge maps. I really feel that Naughty Dog gets the design correct, and to put this game in a metaphor, it's like a gourmet dish: everything on the plate has a purpose, it's artistic, it's beautiful, the design is all of it, and it's really, really, really delicious",

And I really believe that's what Naughty Dog has here with their open-world experience, right there. That's what I think is the real story here for Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. A lot of legacy is not a dog learning and building on what they've learned before in the past - so you had the Madagascar chapter and Uncharted 4, like I said, and they built that. They went from a wide linear experience to an open-world experience, and that's what's really cool, and that's what's really admirable about what Naughty Dog does as a studio. Rather than doing a cut-and-paste job, they went ahead and challenged themselves, and they were able to turn around in ten months' time and make an open-world experience. And not only that, it will still have the moment-to-moment action; they will still have the Uncharted tropes; and they will have the",

And this has been the big news story today why I think this fits into the Roper report is the fact that this is the first time they're out there saying this is an open world area from a from Naughty Dog in an Uncharted game, and tacos however you want to. I think that's interesting for a number of reasons. Of course back at E3 there was a one I think we talked about here on Games Daily at some point there was a pull quote of like yeah you know we'll not a dog ever do an open-world game and there was an idea like we've thought about it, we've tinkered with it but we don't know.

Remember you can write in your questions Kinda Funny Games Daily /kfgamedaily that PR guy wrote in and said Pyre is out today. This game was playable last PSX and it is easily my favorite game of that show. I couldn't stop telling people to put a stop by the booth and play it, and it's the only game I went back several times to play throughout the show. Do you think people are sleeping on this game? I think it has that Rocket League special sauce that will make it really shine.

You more people join your party, and then you can kind of choose who you want to bring into these right so these at the Wrights you go up against an enemy team, and they're trying to dunk the Orb onto your Pyre, and it's up to you to make sure that they don't do that. And so each character has a different movement speed; they have kind of a different ability. So the idea is, don't let them take you out; you want to make sure to get to the Pyre first.
