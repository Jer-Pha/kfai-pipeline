I like to just binge through for hours - it drives my wife nuts, but it's my calming happy time. Sure, okay. Netflix has **** that up for me, but the most egregious thing is the fact that they've done away with the five-star ratings now; it's just thumbs up or thumbs down. Okay, okay. And I don't...

Well then, what's the point of me? I used to think so. I've read both things though - I've read other things where it's like, \"why yeah, why rate it?\" I remember I remember doing that all the time going in there and giving a five-star or four-star rating, whatever. Yeah, it's like if you watch Family Guy a lot, you'll have a five-star rating for American Dad because it's people who enjoyed that also enjoy this - that's so not interesting to see.
