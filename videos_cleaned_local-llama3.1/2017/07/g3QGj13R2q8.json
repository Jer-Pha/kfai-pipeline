They were tired of having to pay for cheaply made throwaway shades, overpriced designer sunglasses which sometimes can cost just so much money, so they're like \"you know what we'll make our own\" starting at just $70. So here's the deal I got these, they're black, they look a lot like the glasses that you know Big C dog, big Nick Scarfo. Weare um, you can get them for risk-free with free shipping and free returns, it's a pretty good deal if you do ask if I say so myself. I also got GSM, she's walking around looking all stylish and stuff, so good for her. I'm really happy with that uh Movement sunglasses started just $70 with the option to upgrade to polarized, most designer brands cost hundreds. Mov figured out that by selling online they could you know I already said this, you can cut out the middleman we can",

You can't explain this in two sentences of what the gameplay is.\" No, it's very difficult. Uh, frankly, do you think that's going to hurt it? Um, it'll make it difficult for people to approach, especially because when you look at like what the two parts the game are, it's that sport and then it's like a visual novel at the same time. So you just had a glance, you're like, \"What I don't know what I'm getting into.\" Maybe that's why I was kind of apprehensive right not playing Bastion and Transistor? That wasn't for lack of desire; sure, that was just like circumstance. I wanted to play those games, and I still do this one. I just totally wrote off because I was like, \"It doesn't seem like anything I'd be interested in.\" But it's so peculiar, and it succeeds.",

I hope it's deeper than a Kirby game for example, and it really kind of reminds me of a Kirby game. It's just it's very simple, very easy; the puzzles are always extremely obvious, and it just becomes more about doing a task to get it done instead of having to think about what you need to do to get it done. Did you play the last Kirby game on 3DS? I roboot, I mean, it was called... so yes, not a very challenging game, and yes, another game that's very charming but had had a lot of opportunities to sort of like, you know, do something extra special right to like perform at a certain degree where you're like, \"I can only do this because I'm good,\" uh, and that game was really great.

But Chibi-Robo didn't have much, and I don't really know what else Pikmin could have because you're just throwing certain types of Pikmin at different things and that's it right? Yeah, and again like I said, it becomes very clear what you need to do. And I don't really like games when they're puzzle-based when it comes to the mechanics of doing it.

If that **** happened, Fire Emblem Warriors coming out on both 3DS and Switch, I wouldn't put it past Nintendo.

When you look at it now, the things that leave me believing you guys are totally right is FIFA, and um, what was the other game that third-party game that's announced for all of them on Switch? That uh, is like going to be the weird toned-down version. I don't know; FIFA is the one that Danny played; he said it feels, I mean looks a little bit worse but it plays well. Like FIFA is actually mechanically fine, right? Yeah, but it's a lesser version of okay, okay, yeah, yeah, there was one other one, I just forgot what it was but",

Remember getting the crown obviously though the multiplayer is probably the worst thing going for the game when you're trying to play it single player because a lot of design was based around being open enough to allow four people so it felt kind of empty when you're just one person running through um but once you beat the game and it opened up all the challenge levels those are some of my favorite levels in Mario history and the amount that there was the amount of postgame content there was, that to me I'm like all",
