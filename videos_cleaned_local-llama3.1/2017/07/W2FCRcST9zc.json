It's supposed to be sticks. There're supposed to be one out of every three that you put in your mouth supposed to be rock hard and almost break your teeth. The problem with Juicy Fruit is it's very similar to Zebra Stripe, where it loses flavor very quickly. Now when Wrigley comes out with the iteration of it being in blocks, Juicy Fruit is taken to a next level. Juicy Fruit in block form is the Iron Man of superhero movies, where suddenly it's like this is a whole... this is a game changer. Game Changer.

Kevin, what I'd like you to do is bring up smuckers.com back here.

I'll say this before, I say again. The only people who should wear Crocs are children under 5. If you're wearing Crocs above the age of five, people should make fun of you. Oh no, Tom Brady wore Uggs. Uggs, that's true. Tom Brees and Ugg's. He's a goat. Don't hate on Uggs. You don't know anything about Tom. Tell him he's...",
