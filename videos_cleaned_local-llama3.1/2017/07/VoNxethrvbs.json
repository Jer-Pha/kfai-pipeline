That's kind of how I feel with the last four movies. I mean, like yeah, but like except for they were, they're great. Oh, it's not even close. Yeah, it's not even close.

Cool Greg, we have to do a watch along with you; y, we got to watch them all as far as I know. I know we all have different tastes. I'm not a movie critic, but I like it was a decision for me not to watch the newer ones cuz I thought they looked like trash. Like I get what you guys are saying, like they're like family and I get why Kinda Funny likes them, but I personally would never, never watch any of the new ones even with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson in there; fun action not winning any Oscars over here, yeah. Um, so I think probably the most things I liked about the series are things most people hated. So I'm putting Tokyo Drift as number one; I really liked it like it has so much rewatch value with me.

It is real intense.
