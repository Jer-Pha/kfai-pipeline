Ratchet & Clank came out in 2002 so it's it's been out for almost 14 years um and they probably should have done this movie you know during the PS2 era but um they're doing it now and I wonder if this really is going to be an example of a series that was dormant or dying because I think that Insomniac not to its own credit because they're great Studio but Sony and Insomniac together really almost did their best to kill this franchise and um with All 4 One and with uh um what was the **** Tower Defense one I can't even think of the name of it into the Nexus wasn't bad into the Nexus wasn't bad but it was a budget short core Ratchet game that seemed like it was made",
