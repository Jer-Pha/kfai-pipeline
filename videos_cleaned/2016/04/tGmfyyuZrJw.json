In the water. Not in this trailer. In the last trailer. Okay. Okay. Oh, when So, like you be Joker and I'll be Harley. Yeah. We're so good at this. Anyway, Suicide Squad trailer 3. Technically two. If you're If you're joining us months from now, this is a reaction to trailer, which is really trailer 3, but they don't count Comic-Con as trailer. Exactly. which is stupid.

Now, do we know that Batman was going to have an underwater breather where he would jump off and go underwater and do stuff? No. Do we know that that's probably the present day stuff and that the other stuff when he's holding up Harley is probably post the old stuff from when he's chasing Joker? We We knew they were going to catch. We knew that. We assumed that was how Harley would be apprehended. You see the Joker taking off. Of course, you saw the other reacts we did over on GameSpot with the rewinds and stuff like that.

I hypothesize they run off in the purple car. Batman's chasing the purple car looking hot though. Oh yeah. Gets on the purple car. Batman gets Harley out of it. That's when he's got her knocked out, puts her in the bat, takes her Arkham or whatever, but then ends up at Bel Reeve. A lot of people yelled at me last time around about my pronunciation, but I pronounced it the Smallville way. And I thank you very much for recognizing that. I'm a Smallville fan. People who recognized it. 10 years Smallville, that's me. There you go. So, Greg, I want to let you know what I thought of this trailer. Lay it on me. I thought it was excellent. Good.

Didn't do anything for me. What are you talking about? He mentioned Superman in the first 5 seconds of the trailer. Awesome. Thank you. We have that worked out so well for everybody. So, all right. Uh, again, when everybody that watched our reacts was on my ass about my thoughts on the music, my thing for Suicide Squad is the exact opposite. I think the music fits it very well.

Are you worried about the re-shoot stuff they talked about? No. Whatever. Thank you. when I do I'm going to credit this attribute it to Scott Bramley. I'm not sure if it was him or not anymore, but I'm pretty sure it was him who said in response to somebody's tweet about that about the oh they're re-shooting. They're putting funny stuff in. He says re-shoots happen all the time. Don't worry about it. Which I know and I'm not worried about it, but they're making headline out of it because of the Batman. Of course, it's an easy that stuff didn't look like new re-shoot stuff in it and it looked good. Exactly. So, the reason I I'm saying I didn't love, it's not that I didn't like, I just didn't love the the first half is because they're used, the song they were using is by Grace featuring Ge, You Don't Own Me, which that",

That's the song that's popular on the radio right now, which is a weird choice for such a dark movie, especially one that the previous things we've seen have Queen, which gives it a nice like, oh, here we're at. But then the second half kicks in, you get balloons. I'm like, this is what Suicide Squad is all about. I'm all in. And then you start seeing the things where they use the gunshots as drum beats and pulling out the swords and stuff. It was perfect. **** perfect. Perfect. Great. Biggest compliment I can give this trailer. You're talking about it giving away too much. I still think there's a lot to give. I I think there is, but when you are Greg Miller and you frame by frame it, and you're like, \"Okay, here's Rick Flag and what was it? Alpha 1",

I'm like, \"Oh, they're going to go in the bathroom.\" They go in the bathroom like, \"Oh, this is when she sank into the tub from the last trailer.\" And then they show a little bit more of her inhaling the stuff, getting possessed, which is of course a call back to the original teaser. Like, I'm on top of this. See, I'm talking to somebody that I mean, I've done those. You're on these trailers with me. I know, but I don't remember it in that way cuz I I don't I'm not like I don't I'm not like you, Greg. I'm I'm a very different person. I just updated my doc from the old rewind. All right.

But I like the fact that over the last couple trailers now, each one kind of gives moments to different people. This is the first time we've seen Pyro. El Diablo. El Diablo. Okay. This is the first Jesus. This is the first time we see El Diablo get his like moments and **** right? And then last time it was I don't know any of their **** names. Bazooka Boy. What was his name? Bamboo Man. Australian guy. Oh, Captain Boomerang. Captain Boomerang. Bazooka guy is what you came up with. You know, uh Bazooka guy. The guy who uses boomerangs. Whatever. I don't **** know.

Had a great that the thing I like is they're giving a bunch of moments to different people in these trailers. And I like that it's fleshing out the team. So, by the time we do watch it, we'll at least have some frame of reference for all of it. I also enjoy that I thought all the jokes were going to be used up in the last trailer, which was one of the rumors, remember that they they said that the reason they were not they, but people said the reason the re-shoots were happening is cuz every funny moment was used in the last trailer.

It's hard to do perfectly. Okay, that's my thing. She's doing great. You're going to leave that theater and you're going to love it. We'll see. And that is definitely definitely a chance. Here's what I want to talk about. We're in the White House situation room again. Amanda Waller, guy from newsroom. They're talking it all out.

No one's 100% sure what's happening here in the thing. I also want to call out Slipnot. Slipnot of course the character everybody thinks is going to die. Popular band in the '90s. Also true. Dumb then, dumb now. Rumored guy to die first. Uh cuz you know we see in this trailer they inject they're injecting you in the neck. You assume they're putting the bomb in there that if you go rogue they blow you up. Everybody says Slipnot's the one who get hit right away.

And also, he shot his grappling hook and then shot into the sky, like shot up with a grappling hook and it looked really dumb. So, I hope they kill him if that's all the budget they can put in. If they were like, \"Slip, this is the coolest way you can make slip done.\" It's like, he goes, \"Fucking kill this guy immediately. Give me a frying pan. I'll kill him.\" Yeah. Bar scene was really good. Mhm. You hope that pans out well for everybody except live not of course. Um the water joke was funny. The wish joke water joke cuz he's a fire guy of course. Yeah. Yeah.

I like I also liked Harley's choreography in the fight like you know if when she was we're fighting all those like weird bubbly black guys. Not the race, but like they're all black, you know what I mean? They're the the mud creatures or whatever for lack of when she like her and Karan's the guy and then turns around is like shooting behind him. Yeah. No, that's definitely it's definitely going to be cool. This is what other things I caught all of uh Deadshot stuff, his gun and his uh thing say I am the light on all of it here.
