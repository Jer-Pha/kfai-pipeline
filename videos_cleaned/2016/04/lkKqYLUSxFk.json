I played Quantum Break over the weekend and beat it over the weekend. Tell us all about it. Tim, I really enjoyed it. I liked Quantum Break quite a bit and I was happy about that because coming in it seemed like the reviews were a bit mixed and it wasn't sure where I was going to go but based on the let's play I we had done, you know, weeks back with Remedy when they were came through town, I was like **** cuz like when Quantum Break originally got announced and we didn't even know what the **** it was, we're just seeing a **** ship hit a bridge and then this lady's got glass coming out her eye and stuff, it seemed cool and it was exciting that Remedy was doing something after, you know, I mean, Alan Wake I enjoyed as well. I was interested to see them try something new though but keep doing the storytelling they're known for and so I was like okay cool it was very",

I don't have any real desire to know more about this until I get my hands on it so we done to do let's play it was that oh oh okay cool like the story seems cool uh the acting seems cool I like where it's going I you know when we're talking about all these different things I had not never really stopped to think about how mechanically it was going to play in so like to sit down and be like oh it's a third person shooter like it's unabashedly a third person shooter picking up you know your machine gun you have a hand you have your machine gun slot your handgun slot and then another gun slot you know what I mean?

Like oh cool I'm picking these up and running around killing these things um transitioning into that was cool during the let's play getting getting a taste of the powers and let's play was cool but then to sit down and play the entire game that's when it really all clicked together and what I found the most interesting about it was the fact that what I thought you know could have been their Achilles heel was those liveaction segments, right? Like remember how confusing this was when we're doing Quantum Break it's going to be this narrative driven thing it's a game but then there's also TV episodes in there and it was so confusing when they announced that of like well is this part of Xbox's entertainment initiative is this something that's air no it's coming then you can't stream and then eventually when you get to it it's like no they just play in the episode and you're",
