This is gonna this is gonna double back like I was saying the last topic to let me said in that topic all these things. What is this state of video games journalism? You said something very interesting in the last topic. Okay, that that was the first time you really felt like a journalist like you're doing something. Yeah, and then you but you work news you made a reference to this game comes out on this day this way. Where are we right now? Do you think our wood is is there games journalism happening? What does it all look like? There will always be a place for the the news, right? Like the the act of a publisher making something and wanting the world to know about it whether it's on their own sites or through the press will exist for a long time. Yeah, they will always need to get that information to communicate that information to the player you will",

You will always want people to know your game's coming out, that you have a cool actor associated with it, that you've got cool plans, that you're gonna have demo at PAX, whatever. That stuff will always be there. It's not the most fun stuff in the world to write, but it's necessary and people are excited about it so you do it. It's also like a gateway to bigger things where it's like, oh, we know this thing about this game now we can write an opinion piece or feature follow-up interview whatever like that is a gateway to do more with something sure. But there's also like actual amazing awesome journalism in the industry right now and I think Kotaku is doing the absolute best of it in the entire industry. Jason Schreier, Patrick are amazing.

Yes, Dunham was like, we were doing every **** game and we all wanted to kill ourselves, but it definitely worked where it's like the IGN was the place for video game reviews. You don't knew that. So when it snaps back and suddenly it's like, all right, cool, I don't want the Angry Whopper video from an IGN. I know I'm getting that from aggregator. What I want to go see video game reviews, are people still think to go there or is it going to be now it is this fractured?
