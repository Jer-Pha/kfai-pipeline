What we have planned this year completely blows last year out of the water, and I don't even know how that's possible because we were really stupid last year and this year's somehow even stupider. Day two, it's going to be a full day of meet and greets. We're hanging out with with all of us. A bunch of Rooster Teeth people are there, Fun House people are there, Achievement Hunter. It's going to be a grand old time. There's going to be some games to play. There's going to be signings. It's it's exciting. It's a really fun time. There's going to be exclusive merch.
