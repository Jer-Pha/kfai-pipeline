What's up everybody? Welcome to the Kinda Funny Gamescast, Episode 65. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside my Canadian maple leaf, Mitch Dyer. We did it, we're back together again. Said we'd never get back together, but here we are on a very, very special first ever Episode 65 of the Kinda Funny Gamescast. Tim and Nick, I said get out of here. Colin, hit the bricks. Yeah, Mitch Dyer's coming through and I want to talk to Mitch Dyer all to my lonesome.

I, I know you're going to deliv, I'm sorry about your dollar. I know you're going to deliver. I don't know why he says that either, 'cause it's always more than a dollar if you're getting early access to the show. About your $1, it's five or $10, but he always says it's worth a dollar, but I think he's going back to when we used to make you pay on Bandcamp. It's a grandfathered in term, a colloquialism. You ever heard of that? You, you have those in old times from colloquial times. That's right, that's right. It's has been a great show. We'll talk to you next time.
