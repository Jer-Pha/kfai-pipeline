      "text": "Hey everyone it's Nick. Uh, I wanted to give you a quick update for what's happening with the Animated Series. Obviously, uh, we're working very, very hard on episode 4, but we are slipping behind a little bit. Originally, the goal was to hit one episode a month, uh, but we've listened to your feedback. We're trying to make them a little longer. We're trying to make them a little more complex and introduce some of our friends as, as guests, and that's kind of slowing us down a little bit. Um, so I apologize for that. The episode is coming. It should be here by next week. Uh, Dean is working his ass off, um, but he needs a little bit of help. So if you guys have noticed, we've actually started doing some outreach, uh, to bring on some more animators. We've got two more animators on the hook, but I still want to get more people on if we can to help out with this series. So if you guys have any experience in Flash or you know anyone that does, shoot them over to kindafunny.com/submit. Um, we'll take a look at their resume",

Um, we'll take a look at their resume, their portfolio, and see if they're right for the job. Um, but again, apologies guys. Uh, you know, we we B off a lot with this series. You guys know it's always the standard garbage truck on fire and it wouldn't be a Kinda Funny production if everything didn't go wrong and it was ridiculous anyway. Um, so episode is coming, more fun stuff, uh, in in store for you guys in May. Uh, hit me up on Twitter @Nick_Scarpino or leave a comment in this video, uh, with, uh, any comments you might have, any, any begrudging comments or anger or whatever, shoot them at me. I'll take them. Again, apologies, but it's coming soon. Poland, no Greg, that's not Poland is just Poland you",
