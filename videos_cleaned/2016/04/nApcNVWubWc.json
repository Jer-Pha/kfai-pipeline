Now sure, you have a lot of questions ladies and gentlemen, so let's address them right off the bat. I think your first question would probably would have probably been at the headline, why is your Uncharted 4 let's play in the Kinda Funny reacts playlist? Your second question, once you clicked on the video, why are you guys lying down like Draculas getting ready to talk about this before you go to **** ground? Now here's here's where it happens. So today we went to LA and we played Uncharted 4 Thief end and we were able to capture our footage. However, Sony would not allow us or anyone for that matter to do face cam footage so we couldn't do a traditional let's play in terms of we're going to play this game, you're going to see our reactions live as it happens. So what you're going to watch here is my playthrough of Uncharted 4.",

So what you're going to watch here is my playthrough of Uncharted 4 Thief on this. I think it's chapter 10 demo or whatever and it's after watching Tim's demo of it cuz they wanted us to capture our second one which we'll talk about a bit in this. So now that's solved the fact of why it's a reacts cuz we're not actually playing the game as we going. Yeah, this is Greg's footage playing, we're just talking over it and you'll see that I'm not at the end. I'm I'll tell you I'm about to go in stealth and then it all goes to hell immediately. But the the the why are we lying in a bed is because we're in LA and so we need to do this now there's days before the Embargo lifts but I go straight to Austin from here.

Um but I'm sure I I'll get used to it, but it's cool because you can use the rope and then you can go out and you can either just keep swinging this way or you can stop and go up it or you can swing this way and it's like you are controlling it and you can use it to swing to another building and kind of go down so you are still hiding from people and then crawl up and shoot people or do what I didn't swing around and shoot people, but that doesn't work that well, but I'm sure some cases it would.

There's nothing more rewarding than that. So here I am man making my moves. It has not gone well, but I have not died which I hang my hat on, you know what I mean? Yeah, cuz you know I haven't played Uncharted in a long time that let alone new school Uncharted where apparently you shoot barrels and people know where you are. That's not how Uncharted used to be. No, I don't know what changed. I don't know why they decided to move that war changed. War changed finally. Wow, I thought it never changed, but it finally changed. I also found this is something that uh is probably just me getting I think part of it's the Division. I've been playing so much Division, so much third person Division where I feel like when I pop out I know exactly where my reticle is going to be and here I did not feel that it's a little more cinematic and I",

No, I agree. Uh but this one I I also was having some trouble. Now this is an interesting point in the demo not for you at home you're probably bored, but for us I scale this thing. I've killed all these guys, but you at some point called in reinforcements here, right? Okay, I didn't the they did. So there's this tower you're kind of going up, right? Yeah, and as I was going up and I was still fighting the guys like you you took them all out when you were down there. Um but I I took them more like I'm going to rope around and like do some crazy stuff. So I was doing that and just making my way up this and I got a sniper eventually and I started sniping people and that was really satisfying. Um when you get to the top there's like a zip line and you see it soon",

Um when you get to the top there's like a zip line and you see it soon. Yeah, when I got up there all of a sudden it went to like a cut scene and they're like they're calling reinforcements and I killed everyone as well. Yeah, and this big truck comes along and just like pulls in and then a ton of dudes came out. I just sat at the top of the tower and sniped them all. So I was like this has like this is part of the demo like this is this is definitely a scripted thing. There you go there's your rope. Oh, I love it. And if you and this is my first time ever using it which is why I am like drunk Spider-Man, but see that's the thing though is I like that you can be drunk Spider-Man.

Because you could scale this building in pretty much a zillion different ways kind of like I'm doing on this part where oh I just jump up jump up jump up now I'm going over here I'm going to flip over the wall I'm going to keep going it's you know it's an interesting merge like you're talking about of like because the game looks so good now it is so much more realistic in terms of visual then you get that weird Prairie effect though you see keep seeing him try Uncharted as well yeah you know I mean like it always yeah um yeah so I got up here and you can see there's the zip line and then over there in the distance you see here it was this this cut scene played yeah and a big truck came out and a bunch of D came out ran",

You probably just didn't kill him good enough like I did that's probably true. I probably killed them so good that they didn't have time to call on reinforcements yeah and then this is when I was like crap I need the car cuz now to my credit early in the thing I you know I turned on the I looked for the car you would have seen a little while ago right and I did that cuz I think the game told me to yep it did but the sound was down on the TV so let's not act like I had all the information you know what I mean not like I can call the car like it's her the Love Bug and it's going I don't I don't think that uh it verbally told you it it was a a HUD thing okay where it popped up and it said hit down on",
