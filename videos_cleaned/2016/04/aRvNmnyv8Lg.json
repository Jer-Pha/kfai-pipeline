We're here to talk about the PS4 exclusive Alienation. Alienation, it's almost here finally. Yeah, uh it's going to be the final what what are they calling the the the six games that are coming out? Do do you guys the launch party launch party that's what it is. Uh it's the final game what I would say the marquee title of launch party shots fired the Housemarque key title. Um and uh alien so Alienation the newest Housemarque game obviously you guys know Housemarque for Stardust or Super Stardust I should say. Uh you know them from Dead Nation um, etc. and so on. Uh they make nothing but great games obviously you know them from PS4 is I think still best game Resogun. Um so uh this is the new one this seems to be most in the spirit of I would say to Dead Nation yeah um and do you want to give it do you want to play or do you want me",
