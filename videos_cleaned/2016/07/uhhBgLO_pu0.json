Oh, for topic one. something that I feel like you could even get down on. Oh, even I can get down on it. Yeah, even you. You can get on this, man. The NES Classic Edition. Before we get into this, I want to read the press release that Nintendo sent out for this thing because I feel like the press release is one of the most important parts of this specific announcement. It's a very different Nintendo. I'm going to read it in full. If you see a Nintendo Entertainment System on store shelves this holiday shopping season, you haven't entered a time machine.

The most likely scenario is you're setting eyes on the Nintendo Entertainment System NES Classic Edition. Launching in stores on November 11th at a suggested retail price of $60. That's right, the NES is back. But this isn't the same NES that you finally remember. This new Nostalgia Fueled system is near identical. It's a mini replica of Nintendo's original home console and plugs directly into your highdeition TV using an included HDMI cable. The console comes complete with 30 NES games builtin, including beloved classics like Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, and Kirby's Adventure.

Each is sure to bring back memories and produce plenty of new ones. You can even enjoy playing se several of those games with two players by attaching a second NES Classic Controller, which will be sold separately at a suggested retail price of $10. A classic controller or classic controller pro can also be used, each sold separately. When connected to a Wii remote controller, the NES Classic Control can also be used to play virtual console NES games on a Wii or Wii U system.

I appreciate this. This is a different Nintendo. This is Nintendo aiming at the nostalgia in the way that we'd like them to. So, I don't know. What do you think, Colin? I think it's great. I think it's an exciting announcement. I think that there's problems with it, but I think that it's a cool way to expose people to some of these classic games, as I said before, and I stand by it.

You're not going to get much better than Mega Man. You're not going to get much better um than The Legend of Zelda. um in terms of gameplay. And so I think that this is a cool uh little ode to that. The NES is my favorite console of all time. I mean, I'm a as I've said many times, I mean, I'm a reformed Nintendo fan, but I don't know many people that know or ate up Nintendo like I did in the NES, SNES, N64, GameCube era. So, it's like those are that is like part of my bloodstream. So, NES is by far my favorite console. Has a **** fantastic catalog of games.

Yeah. For Nintendo to get like deep into their published games because I mean, there are probably 10 really **** awesome published Nintendo games and then probably another five or seven that are like fine and then there's like a bunch of like **** that I would never want to play, you know? Um, so I was like, what are we going to see out here? Like Yoshi's Cookie and **** like that. And then, um, lo and behold, a very unintendo move for them is that they're working with third parties.

So, there's there's certain weirdness there, but when I look at that catalog of games, I'm like, this is a fantastic collection of games and uh overall, and I'm excited to play it. And as I said on I think Colin and Greg like I've been I've been kind of plotting a let's play series called Colin Plays the Classics which I think we'll roll out at sometime this fall and I want to do a let's play for every one of these games.

Um that said it would be cool if there was some flash memory on it. It would be cool if there was some sort of Wi-Fi connection or something that you could do to get these, you know, some to get other virtual console games or there's some sort of port where they could be like, you know, where wave two, wave three, wave four of these games and you just plug it right in and play them.

I mean, what's crazy about that is so these games um I I want to say they're all available on virtual console, whether it's the the Wii or Wii U virtual console. And uh when you add up the price of that, it's something like $150 if you were to buy them all. Yeah, if you want to buy the original cartridges, obviously it's a lot more, especially nowadays, like trying to find them. Some of them are pretty rare. Um, so when you add that up, $60 is a a deal for these, especially if you haven't played them before. And especially with Nintendo, so many people have played these before, so it's like this is probably their fifth sixth time buying these games. I think this is a really nice way to do it.

I think this is a the more physical version of that where it's just like, you know, the NES is the most iconic system of all time, the most iconic controller for sure. And I think this is a really cool way to kind of get in touch with that the Urban Outfitters kind of uh generation of people where it's just like even if you're not a gamer, you still think the NES is cool, you know? It's like I feel like back in uh 00 ish when they did the GBA series for the NE I don't what was that the 0th anniversary or something like that. Yeah.

So I don't know what it was. It was some celebration. I don't know why they did that of the of the NES. And on GBA they released all of the like a bunch of these games. A couple others like Urban Championship which like why the hell would you do that? But uh those are $0 games which was almost full price for a GBA game back then which is which was worth it for some of them and not worth it for others you know?

The box art was so it was GBA that they did the when it was like the NES box art. They actually did the GBASP that looked like the Famcom or NES. You're right. And um that was super exciting. But again like when you think of the the price of that and then throughout the years there was virtual console and then the Wii U virtual console. So it's like you're buying the same games for $5 $4 whatever it is over and over. Then you look at this collection. This is very un Nintendo because of the third party stuff.

Way too much Donkey Kong on there too. Yeah it's too much. They're very different games. And Pac-Man on there there too. We'll get to that. Double Dragon 2, Dr. Mario, Excite Bike. Yeah Final Fantasy. That's the weirdest one. Final Fantasy. Yeah that's the weirdest one for sure. That's the only role playing game.

Why didn't they get Dragon Warrior? Yeah that's interesting. That was a weird one. So then the other thing about Final Fantasy that's interesting is it's just the first one and they there's better versions of that game out too. Yeah. I mean well the being it being the first one's not not surprising because two and three were Famicom games but we didn't get them till later. We never got them in the States.

So this is a weird one too. So Mega Man 2 obviously is iconic Nintendo game. I'm a little surprised Mega Man 3 is not on there too. Or Mega Man one. So like one and two were two and three. But anyway Metroid Ninja Gaiden which is awesome. Again **** awesome game. The original Ninja Gaiden is **** classic. There's just some classic **** games on here man. But again why not all three of them? Pac-Man, Punch Out, Star Tropics, Super C which is the like weird Contra. Yeah I I don't understand why Super C's on there.

That one came out on the GBA thing. I'm pretty sure it probably did. Um Super Mario Bros. 1, Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3, Techmobile, Legend of Zelda, and Zelda 2. It's a great lineup dude. Now that's the thing. When you look at this this kind of is the allstar lineup of NES games. And yeah there is a couple things missing here and there but it's like that's this is way better than I would have ever imagined.

But well I think a big thing too that you need to remember is Smash Bros. So like Smash Bros. has made a whole bunch of things relevant and Nintendo in a way that they weren't before. So that's why Balloon Fight to me is obvious. Like Balloon Fight's gotten so much love over the years that there is a nostalgia nostalgic factor for people that didn't even grow up playing it just because of Smash Bros. Yeah. Yeah. I respect that. There's a few games that I would have loved to be on there. A lot of people were saying like \"Where's Kung Fu? The Iron Game. That's Yeah we were talking about I guess they didn't you know I don't even know who the **** owns that IP anymore.\" Uh Kung Fu would have been nice on there I think.",

Simon's Quest is **** awesome. And Simon's Quest is really a precursor to the open world role playing games we play today and certainly an open a precursor to the openw world uh Metroid Vania style games before we ever had that name for it you know. Um but I was surprised to see it on there cuz that game's not that game is very divisive. A lot of people don't like that game.

I mean it's beatable but that game the funny thing about that game you have to beat it twice. But I think that's why it it's on this list is because when people think about old Nintendo games I think Ghost and Goblins is one of those ones.

So I think that's interesting. I I think that the the reason they chose a lot of these games is to kind of appeal to that Urban Outfitters crowd that is just retro to be retro. Well it's appealing to the mall crowd, right? I mean for how many years has it been that you walk into a mall and you go by that one kiosk that has these like retrofitted N64s that play 60 games and it's all this random **** and you're like \"This can't be legal.\" But this is why you're a pop-up in the middle of the mall and not a real store.

And I I grew up with consoles and we didn't we had, you know, Maniac Mansion and all these kind of games, but it it wasn't it wasn't the same. Like those are the kinds of games that I grew up with. What about things like Tetris? Like that type of Oh, well that's different.
