            "text": "Colin, yeah, what's your topic? Uh, we've beaten the Independence Day horse to death. I can beat it for hours. We could have gone on for 30. So similar to Independence Day. So I was reading one of my favorite things to read about. I like to read about astronomy. I like to read about space. Yesterday, I revisited one of an old kind of favorite of mine, which is something called the Fermi Paradox. And I wanted to present this to you guys and then see what you think the solutions are to the Fermi Paradox. Okay, so the Fermi Paradox, the idea of the Fermi Paradox, and I'm reading Wikipedia just to, to, um, to make it, uh, easier or whatever, says the Fermi Paradox, named after Enrico Fermi, who's a Fermi lab, what up, U of Illinois, is the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence and high probability estimates, EG, those given by the Drake equation, which is another thing I'll talk about in a second for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. The basic points of the argument made by physicist Enrico Fermi and",

            "text": "given by the Drake equation, which is another thing I'll talk about in a second for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. The basic points of the argument made by physicist Enrico Fermi and Michael Hart are there are billions of stars in the galaxy that are similar to the Sun, and many of which are billions of years older than Earth. With high probability, some of these stars will have earthlike planets. And if the Earth is typical, some might develop intelligent life. Some of these civilizations might develop interstellar travel, a step that Earth is now investigating. Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar travel, the Milky Way galaxy could be completely traversed in about a million years. According to this line of thinking, the Earth should have already been visited by extraterrestrial aliens. In an informal conversation, Fermi noted no convincing evidence of this letting to ask where is everybody? There have been many attempts to explain the Fermi Paradox, primarily",

There have been many attempts to explain the Fermi Paradox, primarily suggesting either that intelligent extraterrestrial life is extremely rare or proposing reasons that such civilizations have not contacted or visited Earth. So they mentioned something called the Drake equation. The Drake equation is another thing where someone, I think a Harvard mathematician, tried to figure out the likelihood of how much intelligent life's in the Galaxy using like, and, and there's no way to have really a number, um, a real number basically because they some of the, uh, factors that they have to use are just unknown. So the Drake equation, I'll just read to you real quick. So you have, you have, um, can I, can I take a guess as to what the equation is? Sure. If we all start from the bottom and work real hard, we can now be here, right? You should like so mad I was trying to Google it fast",

You should like so mad I was trying to Google it fast enough. But there's that one Rihanna song where Drake has the equation for the square root whatever. Anyway, so the number of civilizations in our galaxy which which communication would be possible is what equals the average rate of star formation times the fraction of those stars that have planets times the average number of planets that can potentially support life times the fraction of planets that can support life that actually develop life times the fraction of planets with life that will go on to develop intelligent life times the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that release detectable signs of their existence times the length of time for which civilizations release detectable signals into space and people come up with numbers that are anywhere from like one or less",

So there are some people that think like life is so rare that we like it is like like likely less than one, less than one intelligent civilization per Galaxy, which is billions of stars. Mhm. So I tell you that to bring you back into, um, into this thing here. So basically you get the idea. The Fermi Paradox is the idea that if alien life is so common as we so think then why haven't they come and visited us? Why wouldn't they be here? Certainly they would know we were here. So here are the here are the explanations and I want you guys to tell me what you think the if these explanations are good or bad and what you think the explanation might be why we haven't been contact with aliens. We're all equally layman in this. None of us are physicists so it doesn't matter.",

So here's the and this are all from Wikipedia again so you guys can go read about it if you want. So the first one is the rare earth hypothesis and the rare earth hypothesis hypothesis it says those who think that intelligent extra Treasure of life is nearly impossible argue that the conditions needed for the evolution of Life are rare or even unique to Earth under this assumption called The Rare Earth hypothesis a rejection of the mediocrity principle which basically says that Earth is not is not special comp complex multicellular life is regarded as exceedingly unusual.

No. Dum, yeah, I was going to say run through them all run through CU then then we'll weigh what we right. So no other intelligent species have Arisen in the galaxy and we're talking about interstellar travel not intergalactic travel which is probably maybe impossible but maybe a speci so you're talking about in the Milky Way, right? That's always that I mean even in Mass Effect for instance which is like considered re like real sci-fi or like grounded sci-fi they have no prayer leing the Galaxy that's why Andromeda is so big they do go um so no other intelligent species have has Arison it is possible that even complex life is common intelligence are is not while there are remote sensing techniques that could perhaps detect",
