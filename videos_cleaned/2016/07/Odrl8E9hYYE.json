And best of all, Kevin won't be there. Get all the details at kindafunny.com sdcc. All right, topic three, we're doing something a little bit different today thanks to my boy Steven Inler, Patreon producer. Once we're going to do two topics of audience questions cuz there was a whole bunch good whole bunch and they were good. They were they were good. Some of them are all over the place, some of them not so good, but that's why to address that. Gotcha. Okay. All right. Blackheart Vinyl has a long one here. Hey guys, I want to talk about the relaunch of Evolve, but in a broader sense because I know you guys didn't play the game. I adore the game for the record.

Not that of all flopped, it sold pretty well, but player retention was not strong and I think it's incredible that a game can now get him a little more tender loving care and hopefully come back. Greg will remember the rocky start to David Bvik's Marvel Heroes game that has now become something of a hugely successful success and a lot of fun. I'm just happy we live in a time when that's possible. What games would you like to see get a second chance? Oh wow. Well, I echo his point. Yeah, that it's cool that you can come out and like that you know, Gazillion with Marvel Heroes, David Brevik left the studio, but when he David was there, he'd go around and like for year or two and be like yep, the game wasn't that good last year.

It evolves interesting. It reminds me of the Final Fantasy MMO that came out and nobody liked and then they relaunched and everybody lik that's I was going to say yeah like there's there's been a few instances of this happening already.
