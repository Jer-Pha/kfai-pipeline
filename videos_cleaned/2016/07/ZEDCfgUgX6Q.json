No, that's probably not the best. This, do we have any uh lubricant? So Chris, Nick, today's question comes from 7-year-old Dominic. Dominic says every time that I ride the dragon, I assume he's talking about sex, um, I have really awkward, awkward moments and I feel like I'm really messing up sex. How do I fix this? This is, this is a good question for me because I'm really good at having bad sex and but I've learned from my experience what, what have you learned Regal them? Um, you know, maintaining eye contact is good the whole time or unblinking. I feel like that's what you do when you face a bear. You want, you want honestly for me having sex is not that much different than fighting a bear. That's ESS, like that might be what you're doing wrong on the offset. Have you seen, no, no, have you, have you seen uh the Revenant? Yeah, I did. It's the same.",

Have you seen, no, no, have you, have you seen uh the Revenant? Yeah, I did. It's the same. That's what sex you're not having sex, Chris. That's not sex. That's, that's murder that you're committing every time. You know, say what you call what you want. I mean, I, I think that a good thing if, if you feel like you're messing it up, I think you're thinking too much. Like I think you kind of just need to let it happen and just kind of like really do enjoy the moment. Make sure you don't have socks on. I think that's a way to me it up. I always take my socks on good. It's, it's like anything else if you're trying to learn a sport or how to play chess or uh you know, anything that you're trying to learn for the first time, there's a lot of different things that go into it, right? You know, for guys it's just easy. We have, we have one thing and one thing only really think about, but for women there's all",

We have, we have one thing and one thing only really think about, but for women there's all sorts of areas that you should be either touching or not touching, kissing or not kissing or utilizing in some capacity. And so you really have to figure out with your person that you're having sex with, what does she like? How does she like to be stimulated? And notice what I'm saying here, how, what does she like? How does she like to be touched? How does she like to be kissed? Does she like outward stimulation, inward stimulation? All of these things should be questions that you should know because if she's having a good time, you're going to have a good time. Don't get me wrong, it's not that you shouldn't think, you shouldn't think while you're doing it is what I'm saying. You should, there should be a lot of pre-production, a lot of post- production going on. It's just the the the, I don't know, post maybe",

It's just the the the, I don't know, post maybe, maybe not clean up. There's clean up and you got to, you know, you got to be aware of all that. Um, if you're going to finish too fast, what I like to do, make sure you have stuff on the walls to like, you know, read like posters and stuff. You're like, okay, I, you know, like keep reading the names and like, I wonder what that person's up to the person who directed, you know, you know, Dark Knight Rises, you know, like what, what's his, you know, think, think about different things and all of a sudden you're like, okay, good. I'm, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back. I'm good. Got another five minutes. Stamina be damned. I go for as long as I need to go, but, but I always make sure that her needs are taken care of first or while this is happening. And again, I think again, I hate to disagree with you, Tim. I know we very seldom",

And again, I think again, I hate to disagree with you, Tim. I know we very seldom disagree, but I think you have to be thinking the entire time. You have to be paying attention to her physical cues, what's going on with her, is she enjoying it? And you have to be in charge of her orgasm cuz your orgasm is going to come no matter what, pun intended. Hers maybe not so much depending on how in it she is or how easily that that comes to her. Just remember, you know, treat a woman like the baron Revenant. No, Chris, again, we went over this for you. Don't treat a woman like the bear. All right, well he ended, he stabbed the bear. Chris, Chris, where can people find you like sexually or like like on Twitter? Where can people you find Chris on Craigslist? Yeah, casual encounters, um, mail for anything. Um, no, uh it's Chris Demarais on Twitter. There you go. There you go. You can find me at Tim Gettys. You can find",
