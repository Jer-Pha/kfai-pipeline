All right, from a couple weeks ago, we discussed on the show that, uh, me and him once ran a coffee shop and I man, was it called Tim and Alfredo's coffee shop? No, it was called Koo, uh, it was a Hawaiian themed Cafe ran by two gay Hawaiian men, um, who then didn't want to do it because they decided they wanted to go be Hoola instructors. So they passed it on to me and Alfredo. Okay, so you didn't own it, you managed it? We we just we did, we ran it, we did everything else. So this sounds like a sitcom. Like how did you guys run? I know, I know it does. So so here's the thing, the reason I'm bringing this up is cuz I how did this come up a couple weeks ago? Who the hell knows? I think Barista got brought up at some point. I was like, oh, I was a barista and you were like what? Yeah, yeah, uh, anyway, Kevin put in his notes that I I should tell this story. I'm shocked that I haven't told it before on show. Now I've heard this story",
