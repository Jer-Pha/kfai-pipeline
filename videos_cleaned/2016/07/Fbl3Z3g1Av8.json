Look at him over there with the laptop. He's all producing. Yeah, he's this is your second topic in a row where you have a laptop and you got a whole bunch of stuff to. Very excited to get into it. I know. I also like that you're wearing the Beat Cop shirt. Thank you. Supporting our friends who made my second favorite shirt. Now, is it really? What's what's it's not a Heather Grey one, which is an interesting one. No, it's not. Uh, why does this one stand out to you? What does this? I just like the way it fits. I like the way it fits. Shapely. It gives me a little bit more, like we talked about a couple podcasts ago, it gives me a little bit more um space in the guttural region, sure, and a little less space in the arm region.

Let's talk about something that none of us have direct experience with, but we got opinions on, right? I mean, I I do feel this to some degree whenever I look at like 'cause you know, I try to out and it's impossible for me to look ever like any of those magazine covers that I look at when I look at like GQ or I look at Men's Health and you see **** Mark Wahlberg and he's gorgeous or Hugh Jackman or any of these guys.

Uh, but I wanted to read you guys a little bit of this real quick and then get your perspectives on it because I think it's a complex issue. Jennifer Aniston wrote, for the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I'm fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs during daily occurs daily under the guise of journalism and the First Amendment and celebrity news. Now, she's specifically talking, I should I should add, about tabloids. She's not she's not talking about um uh more reputable magazines. This is more like tabloid journalism.

She goes on to say, if I am some kind of symbol to some people out there, then clearly I am an example of the lens through which we as a society view our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, female friends, and colleagues. The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing. The way I'm portrayed by the media is simply a reflection of how we see and portray women in general, measured against some warped standard of beauty. Sometimes cultural standards just need a different perspective so we can see them for what they really are, a collective acceptance, a subconscious agreement. Uh, we are in charge of our agreement.

This conditioning is some is something girls then carry into womanhood. We use celebrity news quote in quotes to perpetuate this dehumanizing view of women. Focus solely on one's physical appearance, which tabloids turned into a sporting event of speculation. Is she pregnant? Is she eating too much? Has she let herself go? Is her marriage on the rocks because the camera detects some physical imperfection?

Uh, we we get to decide how much we buy into what's being served up. And maybe some of the uh someday the tabloids will force us to see the world through a different, more humanized lens because consumers have just stopped uh the ****. Um, so that's that's a small slice of that. She she goes on to talk more about that, and I encourage everyone, of course, to go read her article on The Huffington Post.

So I do want to set that up. He's not and he says he has met her. She's very nice, and they have some sort of friendly relationship together.

It's this: female stars like Jennifer Aniston deliberately perpetuate the myth of quote perfection by posing for endless magazine covers which have been airbrushed so much that in some cases the celebrity is virtually unrecognizable. He also has listed about I think eight or nine uh covers that Jennifer Aniston is where you can clearly see airbrushing happening. Um, he writes a lot about this. I don't want to read the whole article, but I'm going to read a couple more things that he says.

Uh, he concludes with um if she really wants make a difference to this ugly process, she can start by getting a tiny bit uglier herself and letting us see what she really looks like on a magazine cover. Then little girls she's so worried about can know exactly what they can aspire to be, what they what they're aspiring to be.

But then turning around and saying like, well, well, why are women held to the standard? I don't know, Jennifer Aniston, why don't you ask yourself that when you were in your 20s and 30s, why women were held to that particular standard? It's because women like you were on mag covers like that, and little girls and teenage girls and girls in their 20s saw that and wanted to replicate it. That's why. It's not like rocket science.

But Jennifer Aniston opened herself up to criticism because she was an airbrush beauty. She was naked on these magazine covers. She was a sex symbol, and she seemed to have no problem with it when she was on that on that end of it, when everyone was taking pictures of her and she looked hot, right? But like so I'm not I'm not excusing. I think this tabloid journalism. I think she's right in the sense that like this tabloid journalism, this entertainment journalism that says like everything's a story. She's coming out of uh Starbucks and this is what she's drinking or she's like, you know, walking around trying to have a day with her kids. Like leave her the **** alone. Like I don't I'm not saying like what she's saying in that respect is wrong. I don't think we need to criticize her, ask her if she's pregnant. Who **** cares? But that is a different argument. She should be pointing those gun barrels at",
