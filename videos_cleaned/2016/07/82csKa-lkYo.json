I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty, the producer-seducer Nick Scarpino, and the pure one, Tim Gettys. Tim, uh, we're playing the new Ghostbusters game that just came out. Uh, I am this guy, you might be seeing it or you might getting copyright strike right now. This blonde hair business happening. No, not that. I'm the red guy. Who's everybody else? I'm the, I'm the black woman. Okay, I'm the blonde. Gotcha. We're going to play the game. I've not played this game before. My hopes are not high. What do you know the backstory in the canon on Gertrude? No, I don't know Gertrude's why she's taking revenge right now or what's happening at all. But here we are playing it. Oh my God, this like the one we f***. Weapon, is it twin stick on our? So guys, why are you just blowing up the environment? We have to ghost. Do I'm overheating? Guys, you can overheat. Be careful. I just f***ed some s***. So we just do this all",

Whoa, how do I have these two blame guns? 'Cause it's the new Ghostbusters and the classic Ghostbusters and they're busting up together. How I want the classic Ghostbusters. Can I go back? No, it's too late. I don't think you get. I think every character has their own gun thing, you know what I mean? Like what my minigun though? Oh, we all have a what is it called? Well, where how did you, how do you change your one? L1. That's how I switch my weapons. Yeah, there it is. But I think we cross to catch the. This is not canon. I'm crossing all over the place. Nothing's happening. I just overheated that, Nick. Yeah, Thursday we're going to go out and see the new Ghostbusters film. Super excited. Couldn't be more. Are you?",

I worry that it's not going to be fun. I think it's going to be fun just because of the company we're seeing it with. We're seeing it with some, some other friends. Ramsay is coming from what I understand. Alexa Ray Corriea is coming. I think Sean, probably Sean Finnegan is. We're to come back of course, do a react here, KindaFunny.com. So make sure you come see that. Um, got some, got some heads here. I think it's going to be a fine movie. I think it's going to be a fine movie. We're going to laugh.

You're cooling your pack. Nice. We're learning the game. L1 switches weapons, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. This game actually seems pretty thought out, guys. It's pretty cool so far that we haven't, we've been playing for 45 minutes and I don't, I haven't seen one ghost. A game called Ghost. God, they're coming fast now. What you going to say? I got slime. I'm going out this guy's ass. Oh wait, that's you. It's not a ghost. That's a person. Stop shooting him in the ass. F***ing barrel roll, pan roll, vent. You get a vent. Venting.

Got a vent. I can't believe they made another one of these. Sanctum of Slime. This already seems better than Sanctum of Slime. It seems exactly the same. It's controlling better than Sanctum of Slime. It's running better than Spooky. Pick that up. We got one, one man, right? This is a not cool Luigi's Mansion. Okay, now. Mhm. Was Luigi's Mansion cool? Yeah, I mean, we convinced ourselves it was Mario for sure. You have nothing else to play. Yeah, right. The screens. What I realized to do is run. Yeah, it's slow.

I think it was Along Came Polly, right? Is that what the name of the movie was? Yeah, where he's like, she was a b****, a b****. Take your word for it. I you remember he see food and it gave him the poop. The Pharaoh. No, I never actually. How do you know what the Pharaoh? The trailer. Am I? I don't feel like I know if I'm doing damage to enemies. I can't tell if I'm hitting anything, but my uh, controller keeps rumbling and then I f*** up and then it's fine. So good game design, I guess. Right? Just, you know what? Leave me.

Well, Tim doesn't think so. He thinks it's a horrible comedy. Doesn't understand comedy. He only understands it in first one. The first one's a good movie. It's a great movie. Side note, maybe not a movie you want to base your whole life over. You want to talk about a great movie? Guess what I watched last night, Tim? I'll give you a hint. It rhymes with xXx. Oh no, it doesn't. It's kind of like xXx. It doesn't with xXx. It's like xXx. That's what it. That was a better rhyme. Got, got it. Yeah. Have you even seen him gear up for xXx: The Return of Xander?
