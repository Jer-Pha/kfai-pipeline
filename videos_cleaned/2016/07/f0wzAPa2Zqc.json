Like you're basically leveling up only hit points and magic points when you level up. Um, and you're only equipping the the talisman on you which have like some some latent effects and a weapon. The weapon has physical and magic power and physical and magic defense and that's it. So those are the only statistics in the game. Okay. So you have like I feel like leveling up isn't exciting and it's com the problem is compounded by the fact that you don't earn money in combat. You you get items that you sell to get money.

Like there so there's these things called there's a clever thing in the combat system. There's these little circles next to everyone's icon like on the bottom of the screen.

My question for you is about what seems to be the dreaded summer drought. Why do you think big name publishers/developers have not taken advantage of the barren release window between June and August? We see many releases in the beginning of the year but rare titles in the middle. Is this time period claimed by indies or is there I'm sorry or are there reasons a big developer/publisher would avoid this release period? Would love to hear your thoughts. Ford Hamrock PS. I love this community. What you guys are doing, keep up the good work. It's been a quietish summer. Yeah, for sure. But I think that's a great time to catch up on everything.

We've talked about Maximo before because I'm a big Maximo fan, but I think it might was it is it is is it a PlayStation 2 classic yet? Is that a thing that happened? Is that why we that's why we talked about it? Maybe you look into that. I'll keep reading the story. This hidden gem was released on the PlayStation 2 in early 2000 and it was a 3D successor to the Ghost and Goblin series. It's a uniquely difficult platformer that received positive reviews and enough interest to develop a sequel, but I rarely see it mentioned nowadays. For that reason, I believe it is a Forgotten PlayStation Game. Keep up the great work, Rory. P.S. I love you, Rory. I'm a thousand% with you.
