It is what's happening here, Tim, is this is a game we saw uh people trying to get me play, I believe it on GDC is when I first ran into this game. And the idea here is eventually we're going to lose our eyesight, spoilers, and we will see through the power of echolocation. But there will be enemies in the area. Now when I say see echolocation, we have to make the noises. So we're like Batman, if Batman was loud, or if he was like a real bat. I guess they make noises though. You could just leave the I mean that's they don't they don't they go or something and like they it bounces back, that's how they see. So is that what we need to do? We can do that right now. We still, we've been in a car accident, we still have our sight, so we need to get into it.

Okay, over here there's some blood. There was not good. What was that, sonar? No, it's we still eyesight, Tim, we don't have to do. Yeah. Uh oh, what we got here? Looks out oral suspension. Tim, what do you know about oral suspensions? I mean it's never really worked out that good. It's kind of like, you know, 69, where it sounds better in concept. Oral suspension, like you're hanging upside down, she's hanging too. It's never quite the right amount of like friction you got going on. Okay, it's upsetting here. Now we're examining this is some Brandy, Greg. I want to I want to learn. I want to here, I'm pick it up. I I can't zoom on or maybe with the click wheel. This is World building, exactly, Tim.

So what is this? So what does oral suspension do? I mean it really depends on who you are and like how you're how committed you are to the act. I don't I don't think it's the same thing you think is.
