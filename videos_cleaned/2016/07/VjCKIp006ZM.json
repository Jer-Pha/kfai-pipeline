So this happened, this was released the day, well, the day of the last posting of PSI Love You. So we know it was going to happen.

But then when you start thinking about VR, that's where it gets super exciting of like being in a different world and you there is no more I'm looking at my phone, I'm getting distracted by Paratillo, I'm hear the car going by if headphones on them this and I am that person, I am that thing, I am in that world. But I do like to The Last of Us example of me saying I don't remember for those reasons. It's funny because Ellie being a lesbian means nothing to me to that story. It means nothing like like so in Gone Home it means everything that girl's gay, Sam's gay, it means everything in that game but Ellie being gay means nothing.

That's going to be the litmus test of how far or not how far we've come or how how little I guess I should say how far think we are from that game though. Uh, I feel like I feel like a game like that is not even in development because I feel like I feel like the and that's wrong but I feel like that there are developers out there that want to make these games big developers probably and their publishers are like there's no way we're making that game like because they're not they're going to have all these problems but whoever whoever is the tip",

But I did forget all about Child of Eden. Yeah, me too. I remember the box art, yeah, was black and it just said the text on it, right? With like some like neon ****. Yep, yep, yep. It was weird. But that's a good one for getting ready for Rez cuz God knows I am. Holy crap, that was a game people are really excited about on Connect. I remember. Yeah, yeah. But now we're excited for PlayStation Move. Sure, excited for play. Oh, PlayStation VR. Who's who's not excited for PlayStation VR? Everyone's excited for PlayStation VR. Can't keep those those wands on the shelf, right? Here Colin, let me give you PSN's worst name of the week. You ready? This one I won't read his name for because apparently he didn't put it in here. We'll get to the name of the the bad name. Okay, so this comes from Anonymous for right now. Hi Colin, Greg, I know these topics",

Hi Colin, Greg, I know these topics are usually a plea to change our names, but I thought I would submit something a little different. Don't worry though, an inappropriate username is still involved. I bought my PS3 shortly after the release and knew I had to use the handle I had always used in local multiplayer. If you hadn't already guessed by my username here on the Kinda Funny forums, that name was Cooter Intruder. Nice, terrible, nice. For almost seven years, really funny name. For almost seven years in 18 trophy levels, I wore the name proudly having received plenty of laughter and inbox approvals. One day as I logged in to play Dark Souls, I was thwarted by a message stating I could no longer log on and had to call Sony support for help. The kind gentleman on the phone informed me I had been flagged for my username and would need to",

The kind gentleman on the phone informed me I had been flagged for my username and would need to create a new one. Nothing I said could change this. Apparently the name Psychos Sodomy was also not appropriate and I settled with King of the Cosmos. I understood the problem and was happy to at least be able to keep all the digital purchases I had made. However, all my trophies were wiped away from the online record which killed any future desire for trophy hunting. Obviously this means Sony is capable of changing our names, but at the expense of losing our trophy records. Could this be one of the problems they've been facing? You guys certainly love your trophies. Would the trade be worth it? As a PSA if there is anyone out there who really wants to change their name and doesn't care about their trophies have someone report you if your name is vulgar enough you might get it changed all the",

Yeah, that's a lot of people talk about that. By the way, Cooter Intruder, first of all, Cooter Intruder is an amazing name. Seven years he got away. We have to I don't understand like we have to go back or someone should go back, not us. Yeah, someone should go back to whatever however many of these we've done and get all the names we've listed and then we should keep a running leaderboard of what the best names are. Sounds like a job for Jericho over on the forums because he's always on top of this stuff because Cooter and shuder has got to be up there like top three probably. Yeah, that's a ridiculous name. Uh so he had a question there of like could this be one of the problems they're facing? Yeah, this one of the problems they're facing.

So yeah, changing the name now totally erases everything that's happened before. Yeah, and the so the the the systems uh so as far as I understand PlayStation 4 make unifies a lot of this and makes the changing much easier, but as long as PS3 and Vita are still around it's going to be hard to change the names in the way that they want to change them. The trophies exist separately from the name and the and the association with the what you bought in the store and it also breaks leaderboards which is significant. Yeah, um so um the problems are many, but we have it on I don't know. We've heard rumblings that they're doing it for a long time. We've heard rumbl said they're doing it. Yeah, we've",
