So we had E3 already this year. Um, we're gearing up now for all the there's a lot of little things here and there like the PAXes and the the GameStop Expos and whatever, but games aren't usually announced there, at least not big ones. Um, Gamescom coming up, looking at the dates here, we got Gamescom August 17th, then we got Tokyo Game Show September 15th, then Paris Games Week October 7th, nothing in November, and then we assume PSX in December. New York Comic-Con's in there too, right? Oh yeah, New York Comic-Con. And but again, that's one of we have Comic-Con this week. I know, I know there'll be some kind of game little things here and there trying to save you. Yeah, um, that would that's early October I think for New York Comic-Con, but I think these are the ones",

Yeah, um, that would that's early October I think for New York Comic-Con, but I think these are the ones that like, you know, the the big guys have typically had press conferences. Now it's already been said that no Sony conference, no Microsoft conference for Gamescom, but Xbox will be doing the Xbox FanFest over in Gamescom. We don't really know what that is. It sounds like kind of like a mini PSX, but uh yeah, I'm sure it'll just be come play all these Xbox games. Yeah, get cool off in here, play these Xbox. They haven't said there's going to be an actual like conference though, even at their own thing, you know what I mean? But there won't be, right? You can't. I mean, they made a stink about not doing a conference at Gamescom, so this would I would think this would just be their way to get fans controllers have play, but I mean, did they say that they weren't doing one at all?

Um, so yeah, so then when do you think we'll get do you think we'll get something from I'm assuming TGS will get some Sony. Sony does sometimes two conferences at TGS. Um, like two like a pre-TGS conference or some sort of thing and then they do one at TGS. Yeah, they'll Sony will definitely do one at TGS. I just don't think anything of consequence for the Western Market will come out there. Um, but you'll get some teases. I mean, if you're into Japanese role play games, if you're into Yakuza Yakuza or Gundam or whatever, you know, and some very specific third party partnerships with Bandai Namco or with Idea Factory or with, you know, whoever um is putting",

I think you'll see some of that. But uh I like the TGS press conferences because they're intered, but like I I because I'm a PlayStation fan, but I don't expect anything out of them. Um, and obviously Microsoft is kind of just all but given up in Japan, so I mean I wouldn't expect anything out of them either. We'll see uh with Ni no Kuni, do you think that's more of a PSX thing again or no? I think that they have to now give that make that game relevant to the Japanese audience, so maybe you see that there, but we already know Ni no Kuni II exists, so I don't if you've seen TGS press conferences before, a lot of it is just their sizzle reels, pricing, um, you know, things of this nature.

I mean, we know that from working at IGN, we used to cover that conference. I think Ni no Kuni will be in a sizzle reel at TGS for sure, but I think you'll get more information on it at PSX at the end of the year just because that is a game that's sold better here and I understand they need to make it relevant, but that's also not how you do stuff it seems in the Japanese market in terms of making things relevant. Yeah, I'm assuming we'll see some more stuff on Final Fantasy XV and uh that those type of things. I remember at TGS that's where they announced Final Fantasy X uh back for the PS3. Um, so then Paris Games Week October 7th, nothing's been officially said about that,",

Um, so then Paris Games Week October 7th, nothing's been officially said about that, but what do you guys think is going to happen? I don't think I don't think Sony will do it. Um, my theory with Sony and we talked about this on PS I Love You is that like I think that they have to whittle down their press conferences to give them more more bang. Uh I think PSX's press conference last year was fun but over underwhelming, no first-party pop at all, uh which I think was a huge mistake on their part. Uh so I would focus on E3. You can't really give up TGS, so but I think E3 and PSX should be the big tentpoles. They're actually like six months apart from each other, so that's perfect. Um, and uh so I mean if they're going to be a Paris Games, they're not going to be a Gamescom, which opens Paris Games Week. That's what they did last year. They weren't at Gamescom, they did Paris Games Week and they",

They weren't at Gamescom, they did Paris Games Week and they were able to get away from Microsoft, uh who did Gamescom last year. So I mean I wouldn't be surprised if Sony was there, but I also would not be surprised if they weren't. I think it's like a 50-50 kind of thing. If they were going to be there, I would assume and this is I don't think it'll happen, but if they were, I would imagine you David Cage again and maybe show a new character from Detroit: Become Human and like, here's another one of our playable characters. But even that's going to go over better at PSX, so I don't understand why you wouldn't wait there. What about Microsoft? Do you think they have a chance? No, I I just I think these guys are just realizing that they don't need to have this many conferences and when you don't manage your portfolio properly, you have you spread out, you're",

I think I think these guys just kind of need to go away for a little while and and you know, we had a lot of E3 was fantastic, I thought, for both first parties. And so like, why just like, let's focus on those games. You gave us plenty to think about. Why do we need more announcements? Like how many how much time do any when I'd play all these games anyway? You know, they announced like Sony especially had really what I think was a just a **** salvo of amazing announcements and and showed games that we even knew about whatever, and that's plenty. Like we don't need anymore. Wait till PSX and then show us more, you know, um announce something and and uh give it time. And I love the I love the",

And I love the I love the fact that E3 and PSX are almost like just totally couldn't be further apart on the calendar. They are like almost exactly six months apart. And so I think that that's fantastic for giving everything room to breathe and kind of avoiding these other shows. Yeah, then TGS in the middle for really more the endemic like native Japanese market, um I think works out fine for them. As far as Microsoft's concerned, I don't know what their plans are, but they've they have so many games in play right now. I just don't know how like how many more you need to announce. Yeah, so you think the the play for them then is to to not have any more announcements for the rest of the year and just kind of just chill on what they have and do things like the FanFest and maybe bring one over here to and like just kind of get people",

I would say so. I love that idea. It works for that. And then I mean, don't forget, I think you have The Game Awards at the end of the year. That's where you can put out more things, right? I think when you talk about when you compare them to Sony, you have a different there's a different strata and different uh audiences. E3 obviously is the mainstream. You see Microsoft and Sony go out for the same audience there. TGS is Sony getting to speak strictly to its Japanese fan base, which which is large and does want things that we don't want. And then PSX gets to be, hey, here are these cool Indies and here are these VR games and here's us talking about changing your PlayStation name and here's all this inside baseball PlayStation **** that only the people who watch our shows care",

And the Japanese audience is going to give a **** about. You have these three things to work with, whereas with Microsoft having forever ago given up on trying to be a big deal in Japan, TGS doesn't matter to him. Gamescom, they go there and we speak directly to the fans. Here's all the games that you know, Dead Rising 4 was playable on the floor and here's the new Forza and here's the what's the pirate game? I can never remember the name of, Sea of Thieves. These are all over here at E3 and now you get to get your hands on them over here.

There's new content, there'll be one or two new announcements, there'll be titles you imagine from developers over there. But then towards the back half of that, right? Like where does Microsoft stand and what do they talk to? And I think that's where like the the caliber of announcements you get at a PSX, which are like, you know, your A B games or whatever, things that need to be sold, you know, Until Dawn had a great showing there when, you know, let's do a live play and everybody got stoked for it and started talking about it. That kind of thing can happen with a trailer for them. That's where you can get take a Crackdown trailer and put it out around The Game Awards or new footage or something like that and really kill because that's the same kind of audience. Mhm. Yeah, that I didn't even think about The Game Awards makes a lot of sense. So getting off the conferences in terms of games, do you think that there's any big game",

So getting off the conferences in terms of games, do you think that there's any big game announcements coming out the rest of the year? I think the one is Red Dead. Yeah, Red Dead's absolutely going to get announced. I I think there's some sort of obsession and I've heard anecdotally that it really was supposed to be at Sony's conference. I don't know if that's true or not at E3. Um, but I've heard it from one person in particular that I trust a lot. Um, but I don't know the provenance of what that person heard or whatever, so I can't speak to that. But I I do think that people's weird obsession with this game being announced at one of these conferences is antithetical to what what Rockstar certainly does. They'll own this. This will be their own event. Look at how they released and announced GTA V. I still think it's entirely possible this game comes out this year. Um, and when when's your",

I think I think I think it's I think I think with something like Rockstar, because I think they have so so Take-Two has Take-Two has the time and the inclination to make a lot of take lot of risks, right? Like they make they made an exorbitant amount of money on Grand Theft Auto V. They make money on a lot of their games. The 2K publishing are makes its money or whatever. So I think that like Red Dead is one of those games that they could literally announce in the same month they release it. Like and I'm not saying that that's necessarily going to happen, but I think it's like one of the few games that they could absolutely positively get away with doing something like that. Um, and I do not think it would affect sales at all. Like I think that it's a",

In fact, that's the story and everyone goes and buys the game and it becomes like a huge piece of interest. And so, well, I don't know. I don't have any I mean, Rockstar is very secretive and I don't have any information about what they're doing with Red Dead, but Red Dead's clearly real. There have been leaks. They've been working on it for a long time. And uh from all accounts, and I would not be surprised if in September or October they're like, the game's real, here it is, and it's out in November, you know? And what do they lose by doing that? Does there need to be a preview cycle? Did they I I just feel like they learned from Grand Theft Auto V",

Did they I I just feel like they learned from Grand Theft Auto V that they announced that game too early. It didn't matter that they announced it early. It gave people room to, including me, to speculate negatively about the game. Um, I remember seeing it like a year before it came out and I was like, this game's not very pretty, you know? And if they were just like, and I don't I don't think it was an exceptionally pretty game, but if it certainly has scale, it certainly has style, but I wasn't impressed by the visuals of the game. And you know, so with Red Dead, it's like, well, why even expose it to any of people are **** excited about this game? And clearly that like with Red Dead Redemption's um backwards compatibility on Xbox One now, they're clearly leading up to the announcement of the game now.

Like I just would love the idea of them just saying like in September, even being like, the game's real, it's out next month. What do they lose by that? Like the the the only thing they risk by doing this is they eventually have to submit it to ratings boards and they have to get it QA and that that and then certify it and that risks getting trophies and achievements leaked and all that kind of stuff. So they have to play the game very carefully in that respect. How early do you need to do that? Because I'm not too informed on like the the back process of all that stuff. Like what does that look like? How long do you need to to send that in for for rating ratings boards for the trophy stuff for the ratings for all that stuff? So for rating like ratings board stuff, I think you can do that like well ahead of time and so you can and I think you can get it pretty close to the to",

Basically, you pay a certain amount of money, you provide, as far as I understand, tell me if I'm wrong, you provide like a a sizzle reel of sorts of like your game and the parts that you think are notable for like drug use or for violence, whatever. And then the ESRB basically trust you because I think they can find you majorly on the back end about like that you're showing them everything. And then they look at that and they look at the information you provide and they give it a rating or whatever. And there's like a money exchange there to keep the ESRB going on the certification side. Like uh, you know, they're QA these games internally and then, you know, typically and then they send them in for certification. And I think the expectation is that they're going to fail.

Now I'm not saying games don't. I've I heard of a game recently, I've talking to a friend of mine that's coming to Vita that he has certification the first time and he was, you know, happy about that. So I think that happens maybe no more than a couple months ahead of of when the plan releases. Then they send bug reports and all that kind of stuff back and ping them back and then they kind of it's like a pingpong ball back and forth until that's a pretty simplistic way of looking at it. But um, you know, that's the way I understand how it work. You get the idea.

Because games are leaked constantly because of trophies. Now, not all of them are consequential. I mean, the Vita games from 2K were leaked because of trophies. Dead Rising was leaked coming the PS4 because of trophies. Like these things just go up like and it forces the hand. And so they can be basically like, we're Rockstar, don't publish this ****, you know, until and because Sony's seems to be taking more care with that even with their first party games. Uncharted was a great example where Uncharted clearly passed certification a long time ago and the trophies did not pop immediately.

So I don't I can play it real close to the vest and I and I respect what they're doing. I really do believe in my heart that this game is like obviously real. Red Dead 3 is real, that it's probably almost done or maybe even close to being completely done and that it's it's imminent. But who the **** knows? I want to believe that it's imminent.

But now you start to see people testing the waters. Gravity Rush is happening just caused before. Uh Far Cry used to inhabit that spot. Uh this year, South Park: The Fractured But Whole. Like there's people playing around in December, but generally you don't do that. But again, when you're Rockstar, you don't have to worry about missing the Black Friday sales.

It doesn't matter, you know? And it's going to take all people's attentions away.
