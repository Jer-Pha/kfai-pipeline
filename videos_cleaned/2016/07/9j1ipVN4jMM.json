This is so good. Nemesis and the wrestling ring, friends in real life. Exactly. That's the whole Panya deal. Uh, you brought us Videoball. Uh, Tim and I fell in love with it at one show called PAX East. Yeah, that was super fun having you guys over. Yeah, now we're here to play it, uh, and do this. But so we broke it into teams, of course. Uh, Tim and versus Colin and Greg. One pro on each team, one Joe on each team. There you go. So go. We played this for an hour, so we're experts as a team though, so this might be going to be of and weird. And I have Nick. So, well, Nick, Nick knows, Nick knows games. That's what people always say.

You what what did you did you press Circle? There you go. So now we're a red team. Colin, you come over to me. Why am I registered as three now? I don't know. Register my ID, Greg.

Okay, so you're flying this like little uh character around. The only way you can influence the ball in the court is by shooting at it. Yeah, uh, there's different rule sets. Just one ball, some three balls. But basically, you got to get them in the goal of your opponent. Uh, typically it's first to 10 wins is default rule set. Okay. Um, there's also three levels of shot. You can charge your shot. The first one is just like a little impulse, just moves the ball a little bit. The second one kind of if you get the shot just right, can kind of keep dribbling it along. And the third one puts this massive impulse into the ball. But if someone else shoots it, it could be deflected right back in your face. High risk, high reward. Gotcha.

I like what you shot me. You understand this? I do. No, we're trying to get it to Blue. I know you were taking in the wrong direction. I thought that I was dribbling it. Are there two balls now? Yeah, standard rule set is first to 10 and uh three balls. It kind of creates like this push-pull dynamic where people are going. Tim, stop shooting me in the ass. I'm not trying to get out of the way of my blasts. So if you get stuck, damn it, Tim, no, you get shot or you run into a ball, you get stunned. Okay. Tim's experience is shining through here. I know.

He charge it a long time. No, it's so. I think you scored every goal so far. You'll get the hang of it. If you hold down all the way, you get a little defensive block there.
