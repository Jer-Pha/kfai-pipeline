On the back it says, \"My body is ready.\" Now, if you don't know Gal Gun, it's hard to put into words what Gal Gun is. Gal Gun, a series that's been going on for a while, that I'll read you the official description, then I'll tell you what's really happening here. Official description is: The protagonist is struck with an arrow from an evil angel. This makes every girl at his Academy furious with him. As such, they run at him, attacking him at the first chance they get. He must defend himself by shooting girls with a magic arrow, which makes them fall in love with him. The curse does not stop here though. He's the gameplay in Gal Gun: Double Peace, though you're shooting these arrows at, you don't see the arrow, you shoot them and it's they fall in love, but they they fall in lust a bit. It's kind of, it's one of those, it's a, it's a very Japanese game where they moan and like get flush.",

It's kind of, it's one of those, it's a, it's a very Japanese game where they moan and like get flush in the face and weaken the knees and fall down. So you're, it's like you're making them orgasm. It's, I mean, that's what we're really, I mean, if we're getting down to brass tacks about it, that's what's happening. You're making these, you're making these girls orgasm. And then if if that, and that's happened a lot before, long time these games have been coming out, but then this time they've added in touch mechanics where if you're on the Vita or you're on the PlayStation 4, you can use the little touch, you use a touch, use a touchpad and you're doing this and there's close-ups and there's revealing angles. And it's one of those games that it's one of those games you look at, you're like, \"I can't believe this is here in the United States,\" but here it is. All right, here the Collector's Edition Mr. Happiness.",

All right, here the Collector's Edition Mr. Happiness Edition. This little thing you got them all over here. I thought I'd unbox it. We'll see what all is in this Mr. Happiness Edition. Right, first things first, they got cardboard in there. That's good. Oh, it's a case that broke. Okay, good. I was like, \"Oh goodness gracious.\" So yeah, we got the nice box, cool. We got the Vita version I requested, of course, because if I'm playing a game where I'm rubbing people, you know, I'm using this this little beauty, this little pink and black beauty, that's what they go together. And then I get I get to rub everybody. Um, here's the official soundtrack that's what broke. The official soundtrack B busted up there. Two discs or disc A and disc B, all sorts of stuff in there. You're going through there, great. That's good. Here is the DLC code. Um, you can already see her shirt seems too tight.",

I'm not going to show you the code, but if you zoom, can you get close in there, Kev? I'm going to try to give you that one. See like that first frame, they uh, they're just laying around in outfits. I guess I got to rub them till they get flush in the face. Uh, we have the art of Gal Gun. God only knows what I'm going to see when I open this thing. I you do this, yep, that's that's about what I'd expect. This is this is Gal Gun. Remember when they were like, \"No Vita games are coming anymore,\" and they were like, \"We're Indie Creates and PDP, we got stuff for you.\" That's right, right, PDP, no P Cube, sorry, PDP, you make accessories. I don't, I'm think sorry, but you got all these things, you got these girls jumping around.",

And here here, uh, tentacles have tied up her hands above her head and I I made a and here they're in swimsuits. Oh, here we go. See, this is showing a little bit of the mechanics there where to make her not kill you, you rub her butt as you do. I think that's how most people get out of, I mean, in prison that's how you get out of jams for sure. And like, and then here, yeah, this this tentacle monster is doing all sorts of stuff that'll come to play in Gal Gun: Double Peace. So you got the soundtrack, we got the game, we got the DLC voucher, we got the thing here, we got a some kind of got something. Oh, it's a flag of some kind. So you do this and there we go.

Yeah, I I mean, I don't, you know, as somebody who hasn't played Gal Gun since a 1Up stream with Tina Sanchez like six years ago, I'm I'm a little lost at what's happening in the universe at this time. But uh, God knows I'm gonna find out probably alone after a couple glasses of wine my bed tonight, you know what I'm saying? And then finally the Cuda, how weird. Gal Gun: Double Peace Mr. Happiness Edition. They send they give you for your Vita, of course, for your Vita, of course, a, you know how Colin's always wiping his glasses down, they give you a little screen cleanser and it just so happens to be a pair of underwear.

But like this is just totally normal, right, Kevin? Can I could I get on the Muni today and bust out a pair of panties and start cleaning my glasses? I mean, in San Francisco, you'd be fine. Well, in San Francisco, I'd be totally fine. Would you? Maybe not. Depends on your part of the country and how people look at you. Ladies and gentlemen, this has been another Kinda Funny Reacts here on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames. This is Gal Gun. I am going to seriously play it. So I would, it's one of those games that seems crazy and weird enough that I would love to get the Platinum in. I haven't looked at the trophies. I'm sure they I got to play for like 400 hours, but if it's reasonable, I would love to say I have the Platinum in Gal Gun: Double Peace. Throw me back the panties, big dog. Thank you.
