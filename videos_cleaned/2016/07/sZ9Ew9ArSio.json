Tokyo Mirage Session wants to know, \"What are your thoughts on the CSGO lotto debate and how could it possibly affect gaming in general?\" I mean the debate in general, right? What's the debate is if they did something wrong, if they did something right, where they all feel, how we feel about them. Is that the big debate? I guess so. I mean, just for for those that don't know, bring everybody up to speed, Timmy. Yeah. I'm I'm going to read IGN's article. Who wrote it? Who wrote it? You know what? I could tell you, but I'd be lying. What is that fake name guy? What's his name again? Joemo. Joe Skermo. Joe Scrabbles. Scrabbles. That's it. Joe Scrabbles writes, \"YouTubers T.

YouTube channel H3H3 Productions and associated with honor on the call has alleged that both T- Martin and Proen have used their channels to advertise a Counter-Strike betting site CSGO Lotto without disclosing that they are the site's president and vice president respectively. Uh they have 5 million subscribers across two channels and Pro Syndicate has 9 million. CS:GO Lotto, like many Counter-Strike betting sites, lets players wager weapon skins they have won in the game's loot crates. Counter-Strike skins can be valued at thousands of dollars, making this a potentially very lucrative or costly practice. One of Martin's videos shows him winning approximately $13,000 worth of skins. H3H3's video includes clips that show both Martin and Castle using the site. One clip of Martin shows him discussing CSGO lotto saying, quote, \"We found this new site.

However, H3H3 shows company incorporation documents that appear to show Martin as the company founder dated from before that original video was released. Disclosure lines are present on several of Martin's betting videos, but H3H3 points out that the internet archive indicates that these were added after honor the call releasing a video alleging Martin's uh impropriety last week. failing to disclose that one owns or is being sponsored by a company.

Martin appears to have made all of his counteract global offensive betting videos private, meaning they cannot currently be viewed. He also put up that video then took the video down kind of his apology video. Now it's gone and now he's just saying I'm not talking about this because obviously I'm sure there's legal stuff going on. What are your your gut reactions to this? I mean the gut reaction right is that it's a shitty thing like this is the you know I always go back to with us where we left we founded this business and we never thought to like what are what's our policy on anything and then it was on that first colony live right we announced it you know at 9:00 a.m. And",

We're just like let's just tell you you know what I mean when something's sponsored you'll know when Square Enix sends us somewhere you'll know like we have nothing to hide. We want you we want to be as transparent as possible you know overly transparent for most part. So that's what gets me you know not even getting into the nitty-gritty of this and what did Violets and blah blah blah blah. It's the fact of like, \"Hey guys, we found this site.

Like why why not just say that you own it that hey, we're we're starting this and we're doing this and this is how it works. I mean, I think that's what they did is even a step like further than even rationally allowed in any way because if they just didn't say that they were sponsored and didn't say that they owned it, that's one thing. But to be like, \"Oh, we just this just came to like they like actively lied about the whole thing.\" It'd be like us, you know, saying, \"Oh, we love this game even.\" And then not mentioning that it was sponsored and like, you know, totally lying about the whole thing. Um, I think for us like we we are so transparent with everybody that it's like they our people trust us, you know?

Is I feel like with this and then like I always talk about with like season passes or whatever, you get everyone having an opinion, right? I am not wellversed on this. I've watched the video today on call and glide. I've I've heard the news stories. People in our chat were like, \"It's worse than you guys are making out. Jim says this.\" I'm like, \"Okay, like I'm not trying to make myself an expert on this.\" And that's the problem I feel is that everyone rears up and has an opinion.

And that's what I don't know about these guys of like I've never watched their videos. I've heard their names before, but it's not my kind of content obviously. So, it's just like does their audience expect them to be held to the standard that we are? And like obviously I think they should be and that's obviously the best part about this. You know on GameOverGreggy this week we talk about uh police brutality and all this different stuff and like how talking about it helps but is that enough anymore and it's so so crazy and stressful right now as we still write the rules and all these different things about YouTube.

They go, \"Okay, well, this is how badly it can go. We have to learn from this.\" Yeah. I think the the drama side of it is the most interesting to me in the sense that like people latch on to that so much and obviously drama gets clicks and drama like, you know, people are interested in that and all of a sudden we're talking about Counterstrike Go.

But to see a website that like the IGN's of the world are covering this, that's crazy because you don't see IGN covering like, oh, this YouTube channel just launched a new show. Sure. You know what I mean? But yet they're covering this randomass uh sponsorship deal thing. I just think that it's it's really interesting that like even H3H3 Productions, the guys that kind of exposed all of this, that's what they do. They expose the drama of YouTube and all this. And they recently got sued for copyright stuff. Do do you guys know what I'm talking about here? No. The they got really hit with a big a big case and all the YouTubers kind of like rallied against it whether or not they like H3H3",

You can't you can't just **** say it's copyright and just because you don't like what he's doing.\" Of course. So, Philip DeFranco, Jenna Marbles, like all the top YouTubers put and Fine Bros put tons and tons of money into um supporting him with a GoFundMe so that he can like fight these guys in court. So, him doing this makes sense. You know, him exposing this and him kind of getting it out there because that's how he makes his livelihood is right drama and exposing all this **** But, it's just interesting to me that like legitimate news sites, video game news sites are covering this in the way that they are.

No, immediately everybody's like, you **** knew it doesn't matter. It's like we have to sit there and go, \"No, there's a wall between advertising, editorial, we have no idea what's about to go around the sides of the site.

If all of a sudden we were going to do a Hitman let's play, right? It would like and I'm talking about like a review discussion I guess more than a let's play.

Then we went to the Ubisoft booth, saw a bunch of games, did a bunch of reacts, but two of them were sponsored by Ubisoft. So they begin with us saying this is brought to you by Ubisoft. You know what I mean? And and take and like I stole Colin's line of take it all with a grain of salt, but I really liked that game and it's not because they paid me.

I think the other thing too that a lot of the people out there might not know is that at least as far as I'm concerned, most of the people we deal with, I'd say 99% of the the companies we've dealt with, uh whether it's game developers or otherwise, um they're on our side too because they want it to be genuine and they want it to be real because they understand that's where the value is. Just talking about a thing and lying about a thing, they could do that. That's what they do.

Are we being transparent in the right way? Yeah. Um I actually really don't like the hashtag ad thing. Oh I hate it too. But I mean it's cuz it eats up characters but Well that I mean that is an issue but I I just feel like that also makes it it makes it feel more uh fake. Yeah. Than than we mean it to be.

Even though I've read a lot about it I'm just not comfortable doing that. My gut instinct tells me these guys obviously **** up in a major way. I think that guy's apology video which you pulled down was super smug um and nonsensical. Um him saying like it was a matter of public record. Yes it was a matter of public record but you still never said that. Um a lot of things are a matter of public record. I mean many things are a matter of public record. So but that doesn't mean that that your audience is aware of it. Um so I like Greg said like with our own content the only thing I don't care about them like I care about us and like our my own",

I think once you lose trust you lose it um irredeemably and so I think that um it's really important to for us as a company to to stay above board and I think we do that and as far as these guys are concerned I you know yeah hurl your your YouTube abuse at them if you I mean if that's what makes you feel better but I think what would be more effective is if they just disappeared like because they had no relevance anymore you know like that that would hurt them more than anything.

That's what we all so many people fall into on in Twitter and social media where they're mad about something and so they will retweet it and talk about this person or this thing or this problem over and over again when they aren't there's no what they're doing isn't going to be the solution. And it's just being a way to amplify the message. Like the vagina picture that's going make the rounds today. Oh that's the one about Taylor Swift. Oh the sandwiches. Yeah. Yeah.

Other institutions other groups learn from it and then just you know you you made a mistake and you and you judge it based on that.

They don't deserve all those kind of things. And they're and they're eventually going to be removed. And you see that happen.
