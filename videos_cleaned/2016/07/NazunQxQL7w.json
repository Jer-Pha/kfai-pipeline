            "text": "Hey everyone, it's me Nick. Uh, I wanted to update you guys again for what's happening with the Animated Series. Uh, last time we talked, we we thought we'd have an episode out by June. That is unfortunately not the case. Uh, we are slipping a little bit because we are actually doing the intro and episode 5 in tandem. Uh, last time we talked to you guys, we were looking for animators. Well, we've hired two, uh, almost full-time, and now Dayan actually has decided to come full-time with us as well. So he's no longer part-time, he's just going to be full-time working for us just doing the animated show, which is very, very exciting, which is very, very cool. Uh, which also hopefully means, uh, that we can start to catch up a little bit and the goal originally, if you remember, was to do once a month. I don't think that's really realistically going to happen. Um, the big question everyone has though is as the schedule is",

Um, the big question everyone has though is as the schedule is dropping behind what does that mean for the 11 episodes in the intro? We are absolutely going to do those 11 episodes and the intro no matter what. I will literally pay out of my own pocket to get these things done. It is going to happen. It's unfortunately not going to happen in the year span that we thought it would happen in, uh, but we are going to try our damndest to get them out quickly to you guys. I'm also going to be doing more of these updates, uh, because you guys, a lot of you guys have been awesome, hit me up on Twitter, hit us up on the Facebook group, uh, and the forums and and asking what's going on with this. I completely understand on our part, we got to be a little bit better about that, so we're going to, I'm going to update you guys a little bit more and we also have some behind the scenes",

I completely understand on our part, we got to be a little bit better about that, so we're going to, I'm going to update you guys a little bit more and we also have some behind the scenes stuff coming, uh, as far as animatics and some concept art and stuff like that. So we'll be putting those out on Patreon for all the Patreon supporters what we want to do with the intro. Um, and you guys probably saw it if you right Kinda Funny Live, but we want to ape every single awesome intro from the 80s and 90s that we could think of. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, G.I. Joe, uh, Powerpuff Girls, things like that. All these things we wanted to to just have this amazing Fanfare homage, uh, to these the cartoons that we loved. Dean loved it, Tim of course loved it, and then I realized it's 7 shots with 7 different characters that have to be groups of characters rather that have to be animated or and designed for this thing. Um, so it's going to take a little while. That said, it's going to be awesome. I know it",

Here's one piece of the concept art right now right here. Okay, that gives you a little bit of a taste. Again guys, I know excuses are all like everyone's got them and they all stink. I hate making excuses. I'm not making excuses. This is my bad. I apologize to you guys. We are slipping behind. I take full responsibility for it. Uh, you guys gave us your hard-earned cash and we owe you episodes and you will get those episodes and they will be every bit as ridiculous as humanly possible. Um, to give you, uh, just a little bit of a a teaser as to what's happening in episode 5, um, it's going to be the guys in Biology class learning about sex ed for the first time and there might be a clown and he might be a",
