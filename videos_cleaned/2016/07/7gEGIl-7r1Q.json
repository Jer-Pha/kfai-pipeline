Technically, it's a dog toy that looks like a cat. I meant like cat toys. It's a toy that is a cat, not it's a dog. You got me nailed. Theoretically nailed me. And also, Greg, so you're telling me that this thing will **** whoever the **** it wants to, but it play by cat get in people's mouths. Oh, no, no cat would play with this toy. Cats play with that toy? No way. You don't know ****, Greg. Anyways, we talk about video games a lot.

We've been to so many conventions in a row. I was like, I going to play a console game and I'd like to get some trophies. And I saw Oxenfree. I was like, I wanted to give that another shot. Da. I jumped in, played a little bit Oxenfree again. It just doesn't work for me. I've tried. I've given it a few shots. I played through it on Xbox or I guess Steam. Um, it's a fine game. I, I wasn't in love with those other people. I, I still like parts of it. So I closed it, went back to the media bar or whatever and saw a Song of the Deep chill in there.

It was just like the reveal of it being an underwater game. Clicked on Song of the Deep, got into it and immediately was fell in love with it because it's it what I didn't realize I was looking for was something I talked about a lot with Unfinished Swan of gaming comfort food. Like that I always talk about, I think in my review of Unfinished Swan for IGN, I talk about, um, it's like a cup of cocoa and a blanket. Like it's one of those things like you want to hunker down with it and just spend it.

She, you know, waits up from every night and one night he doesn't come back. So she and like all this is happening in like storybook pages. Like really, really not intricate art, but storybook art. Like what I would expect out of that same color palette, same everything else. And so then you get into the game and the game is as beautiful as that. More than that, like that's setting in the tone for what your color palette's going to be and how the game's going to be. But then the levels themselves incredibly beautiful.

Oh, Gills. Big twist. Yeah, but it it was totally hit this nerve. I, I didn't know. We always talk about, you know, games scratching itches that we didn't know were there or whatever. And it totally got me. And sitting there and playing it and being in love with everything that was happening. And it's a, you know, if you don't know, it's a Metroidvania game. You're in this little submarine submersible going through looking for your father. You can zoom out and see how huge the map is at any time. You're obviously running into plenty of stuff.

Turns out you get out of the ship eventually when you get this other thing. It's a, it's a, it's a beautiful game. It is a game that's speaking to me on a storybook level, which I really appreciate. And something I, I was talking about because the, you know, reviews I saw, I didn't, I didn't read any reviews beforehand. Started playing it and after like that first day with it, Saturday, I jumped out to just look at scores and saw that it's getting like sevens and sixes. I understand that.

You're playing it and there is, I don't feel like there is this bigger message. It isn't pushing technology in a different way. It's like, here's a fun Metroidvania game for you to play that theoretically should take you a weekend, probably or two days, right? I spent all Saturday playing, jumped in on Sunday, did a couple hours, did a couple hours Monday night or maybe an hour Monday night. And so I still feel like I have, I was, I think I estimated yesterday when we were talking about like four hours left if I'm guessing, which I don't know, but based on trophies and bosses that are still out there and stuff like that.

There's a harder level, but I'm not getting to this point where I'm feeling like I'm pissed off at enemies. They're putting me in a room where it's like Gauntlet and maybe I'll die and then I come back and kill everything. You know, okay, cool. The weapons are there. Upgrades are attainable. Like it's one of those, you know, Metroidvanias are all about, you know, finding your new items, weapons or, you know, abilities and then maxing them out through your skill trees and stuff like that. Same thing here with taking the gold you found and buying from the shrimp man or whatever the upgrade you need. And it's it's fun. Like it's super, it's simple and it's a game.

So how does the game, how does the game play? And what do you, so you're in a submersible? Yeah, you're in a little submarine that you go. Um, and then, uh, you fire rockets with it or and stuff like that. You're eventually, yeah, your first basic thing is that you have a little hook shot basically that you can shoot out that you can, you can use to grab things to interact and pull levers and, you know, certain times they'll be ones to pull levels, levers to open doors and then release and then try to get over there and get out. So it's like from the basic level, yeah, it's the little grappling hook kind of thing that you're using that you can shoot into enemies and attack them that way and then flank them and do it again.

Then yes, you get Torpedoes at some one point and then you can upgrade them to have dual Torpedoes for one shot. Then you get the this like, uh, you get a ice blast that can freeze enemies or like you can use it in puzzles because there's puzzles to it too, obviously, where you can make when you freeze these like, like I guess what do they call them? Warheads if you want or bombs, I guess, mines. Once you freeze them, they can then can like they become buoyant and so you can use them and move them around and blow stuff up like that. Um, yeah, there's a a thermal detonation one out, stuff like that. Uh, you have a boost to, you know, swim faster, which then comes cause there's other times where it's like you got to try to fight the",

So it's it's interesting. Like every Metroidvania, I think my favorite part is learning the mechanics and seeing things like, oh, how am I going to do that? So the first time it's like, all right, cool. I can boost this far. And now that I've upgraded my grappling hook, I can grab that thing and then, you know, pull myself around and swing over there. And there's all that. And then eventually they start tossing. And the only the downside to the game, I feel like is they put in some, uh, you're having this great time. You're in the submersible. Everything's really cool. Then they put in some of those like light puzzles. Like, you know what I mean? Like, all right, you have to get this laser up here.

You know what I mean? Again, it's it's a, it's a, it's a simple game. And I don't mean that as a, you know, a way to distract from it. Sometimes I was over complicating it. But when I first got in this room and I have like two sets of red, two sets of blue, two sets of green that I'm trying to bounce all around all these mirrors. I was like, this isn't what I loved about this game. This isn't where where I wanted to be. But I got out of it fast enough to keep going. And the other thing is that it is long. I do feel I was looking for. I when I started, I'm like, I'm going to beat this in a day. And then when I did, I was like, okay, I'm, I'm going to go over Nick's watch UFC. I'll beat it",

It's not overstaying its welcome, but I think I was trying to power through it. Not power through, but I wanted to get through it like I did Unfinished Swan where it was like a sitting and I was over it. Um, this has more lasting power, but that only agitates me more in the fact of why doesn't have a platinum? Like why is this not being treated like a real game if it's on disc? It is long. It is really bizarre. Huh. When I saw that, we talked about that on PS I Love You. I think you weren't there, I guess, but we did talk about, we talked about on Colin & Greg, I think as well. But we, I talked about on PS I Love You that this game has no platinum trophy, which is really **** annoying actually. Like to me, like it's not bizarre anything.",

I know it's not important to a lot of people, but to a lot of people it is important. And I thought that was a, it's not a turn off. I want to play the game. I've had, I, I, the only reason I haven't played is because I haven't really been here, but I was on vacation. But, um, so I've been playing Vita. But, um, that sucks. I saw like, like, like there's collectibles and upgrades all like, there's a million different ways you could have fleshed this out. And that's the thing for now that I'm in the fact that it didn't have a platinum. And I started off and I'm like, oh, it has, it's ringing like Unfinished Swan. I expecting that kind of experience.

It's like, this is a full-fledged game. Like, so why isn't being treated like that? Yeah, why is it that I'm going to upgrade all my things for a silver or whatever when it should be that I'm going through? Silly. How did the upgrade, how does the upgrade system work? Because one of the complaints I've seen in reviews of the game was that, uh, the upgrade system, I don't mind this kind of upgrade system, but I guess some people do is that like you have to kind of pick and choose the upgrades you have to, you have to use. But eventually you are so experienced that you can just fill out the entire tree, which to me is fine. But a lot of people or like one review in particular I read really had a problem",

But a lot of people or like one review in particular I read really had a problem with that, that it wasn't as thoughtful as it seemed in the beginning. In other words, you to make your choices. And then, I mean, that's how I always do it, right? Like for me, looking at an upgrade treat, it's always like, well, there's a a trophy attached to it. And how does that work? So for me, it was I put everything into the hook shot. I was or the grappling hook. I was using it so much. And then when I got Torpedoes, I started putting everything into Torpedoes and ignoring some of the other stuff. And then now that I'm, yeah, making more money because what you do is you go through, you beat the enemies. They drop gold or silver coins. Uh, your map when you pull out, which I, I really love. I know some people want like Axiom Verge has so many hidden secrets and it's you don't, you have to leave one or two markers",

I don't never know how to get to it. This one, once you explore the map and fill it out, you see every treasure chest. You see every door. You know, like, so it's like Shadow Complex. Exactly. You know, everything's there. So for me, it's totally that carrot on the end of the stick of keeping me motivated where it's like, all right, cool. I've, you know, I got the three gems to do this. And now I need to go over there to do that. And I could take this really direct route, but I haven't, I haven't been back up there in forever. So let's go. So you go through there and you're getting like gold or silver fish statues or pearls or stuff that give you more and more coins.

Are the games you've, you have play? Well, so I mean, we're talking about, I've played Symphony of the Night, but that was a long time ago. And then more recently, Axiom Verge. Axiom Verge is huge. So, so is it? It's not, it's not that big. I when you zoom out, you' you could look at it and be like, oh my God, it seems like it's huge. But you move so quickly through it. It's it's not, again, I don't mean to insult it or anything. It's not baby's first Metroidvania, but it is like a dumb down. It is a simple Metroidvania. You can, we suggest that that is the entry.

I want to, I don't want every game to be like this, but this is a kind of game I was missing and didn't know I was missing where I do want there to be like someone's reading me a story and I'm just participating in it.

And it's it's when when I do die, it's not like, man, there's no way to get around. I'm never going to figure this out or get past it. It's like, no, I did something wrong. You know what I mean?
