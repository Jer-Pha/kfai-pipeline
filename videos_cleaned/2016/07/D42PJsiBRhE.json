I'll be I also want to I want to lead with still haven't beaten Song of the Deep because it's way longer than I thought it was going to be, but I'll walk you through it. What Song of the Deep for me is hitting on something I didn't know I was missing. Uh, Saturday I woke up. I wanted to play something. I thought I was going to play Oxenfree.

I jumped in, played a little bit. Oxenfree again, it just doesn't work for me. I've tried. I've given it a few shots. I played through it on Xbox or I guess Steam. Um, it's a fine game. I I wasn't in love with those other people. I I still like parts of it. So I closed it, went back to the media bar or whatever and saw a Song of the Deep chill in there. And I was like, I legitimately didn't know anything about Song of the Deep. I clicked on it. I mean, I knew it was Insomniac game. I remember when they were teasing the reveal. They put out the little trailer, whatever, but it wasn't even a trailer. It was just like the reveal of it being an underwater game. Clicked on Song of the Deep, got",

Like that I always talk about, I think in my review of Unfinished Swan for IGN, I talk about, um, it's like a cup of cocoa and a blanket. Like it's one of those things like you want to hunker down with it and just spend it. And part of that I think is the fact that in Unfinished Swan, someone's telling you a story like very clearly, you know what I mean? They're talking about the boy. They're doing all these different things. And Song of the Deep is the same way where it's like, this is Marin and her father live. Her father's a fisherman. They live out here.

Like what I would expect out of that same color palette, same everything else. And so then you get into the game and the game is as beautiful as that, more beautiful than that. Like that's setting in the tone for what your color palette's going to be and how the game's going to be. But then the levels themselves, incredibly beautiful. Uh, the soundtrack, the the, you know, instrumentals that are going behind it, awesome, beautiful too. And then you have this really, really great narration from this Irish woman that I and I again, I haven't beat it. Maybe at the end it turns out to be her mother.

And sitting there and playing it and being in love with everything that was happening. And it's, you know, if you don't know, it's a Metroidvania game. You're in this little submarine submersible going through looking for your father. You can zoom out and see how huge the map is at any time. You're obviously running into plenty of stuff. You're like, clearly this is a door or a barrier that I can't get through with my current weapons. So I know that at some point I'll come back. And you're going and there's like little crevices to go in. And you're like, okay, am I going to be able to shrink the ship or something else?

And something I I was talking about because the, you know, reviews I saw, I didn't I didn't read any reviews beforehand. Started playing it and after like that first day with it Saturday, I jumped out to just look at scores and saw that it's getting like sevens and sixes. I understand that. I would I mean, I I would be, you know, high sevens or whatever, maybe an eight if I was still having to worry about that kind of crap. But I don't, thank goodness. So I understand that why I'd be getting that, because for me, in the good way, it's very much a game if that makes sense.

It isn't pushing technology in a different way. It's like, here's a fun Metroidvania game for you to play that theoretically should take you a weekend, probably, or two days, right? I spent all Saturday playing, jumped in on Sunday, did a couple hours, did a couple hours Monday night or maybe an hour Monday night. And so I still feel like I have I I think I estimated yesterday when we were talking about like four hours left if I'm guessing, which I don't know. But based on trophies and bosses that are still out there there and stuff like that. I think it's a really well put together package. It's a really interesting, fun world. Uh, there's, you know, like I'm I I'm playing on normal. There's a harder level, but I'm not getting to this point where I'm feeling like I'm pissed off at enemies.

Like it's one of those, you know, Metroidvania are all about, you know, finding your new items, weapons or, you know, abilities and then maxing them out through your skill trees and stuff like that. Same thing here with taking the gold you found and buying from the shrimp man or whatever the upgrade you need. And it's it's fun. Like it's super it's simple and it's a game. And I think just the way I'm describing it, you know now what this thing is. But there's something about it. There's something special to it. You're not talking about mechanics though. So how does the game how does the game play? And what do you so you're in a submersible? Yeah, you're in a little submarine that you",

Yeah, you're in a little submarine that you do. Um, and then, uh, you fire rockets with it or and stuff like that. You're eventually, yeah, your first basic thing is that you have a little hook shot basically that you can shoot out that you can you can use to grab things to interact and pull levers, levers to open doors and then release and then try to get over there and get out. So it's like from the basic level, yeah, it's the little grappling hook kind of thing that you're using that you can shoot into enemies and attack them that way and then flank them and do it again. You can upgrade that and, you know, make it more powerful, make all these different things. Then yes, you get Torpedoes at some one point and then you can upgrade them to have dual Torpedoes for one shot. Then you get the",

Warheads if you want or bombs, I guess mines. Once you freeze them, they can then can like they become buoyant. And so you can use them and move them around and blow stuff up like that. Um, yeah, there's a, uh, thermal detonation one out stuff like that. Uh, you have a boost to, you know, swim faster, which then comes because there's other times where it's like you got to try to fight the current, but you can't, but you can see that you need to at some point. So it's it's interesting. Like every Metroidvania, I think my favorite part is learning the mechanics and seeing things and like, oh, how",

I can boost this far. And now that I've upgraded my grappling hook, I can grab that thing and then, you know, pull myself around and swing over there. There's all that. And then eventually they start tossing. And the only the the downside to the game, I feel like is they put in some, uh, you're having this great time. You're in the submersible. Everything's really cool. Then they put in some of those like light puzzles. Like, you know what I mean? Like, all right, you have to get this laser up here. So to do that, you need to like move all these mirrors and bounce light around. They're super the old mirror laser puzzle, the old mirror laser puzzle. So they're they're not hard.

But when I first got in this room and I have like two sets of red, two sets of blue, two sets of green that I'm trying to bounce all around all these mirrors. I was like, this isn't what I loved about this game. This isn't where where I wanted to be. But I got out of it fast enough to keep going. And the other thing is that it is long. I do feel I was looking for I when I started it, I'm like, I'm going to beat this in a day. And then when I did, I was like, oh, okay, okay. I'm going I'm going to go over Nick's, watch UFC. I'll beat it tomorrow. And then I got in for a little bit. I was like, man, there's still more. It's not overstaying it's welcome.

Um, this has more lasting power. But that only agitates me more in the fact of why doesn't have a platinum trophy? Like why is this not being treated like a real game if it's on disc? It is long. It is. Are huh? When I saw that, we talked about that on PS I Love You. I think you weren't there, I guess. But we did talk about we talked about on Colin & Greg, I think as well. But we I talked about on PS I Love You that this game has no platinum trophy, which is really **** annoying actually. Like to me, like it's not bizarre anything. It's obnoxious that like the game this long, this deep, a Metroidvania game has 10 trophies or something like that. I know it's not important to a lot of people, but to a lot of people it is",

I've had I the only reason I haven't played is because I haven't really been here, but I was on vacation. But um, so I've been playing VA. But um, that sucks when I saw like like like there's collectibles and upgrade. It's like there's a million different ways you could have fleshed this out. And that's the thing for now that I'm in the fact that it didn't have a platinum. And I started off and I'm like, oh, it has it's ringing like Unfinished Swan. I expecting that kind of experience. And now that I'm more geez, God, I don't know, eight hours in, we'll say, maybe, you know what I mean? I'd have to go look at a game clock or whatever. Seven, eight hours in. It's like, this is a full-fledged game. Like, so why isn't it being treated like",

Like, so why isn't it being treated like that? Yeah, why is it that I'm going to upgrade all my things for a silver or whatever when it should be that I'm going through getting silly? How did the upgrade how does the upgrade system work? Because one of the complaints point I've seen in reviews of the game was that, uh, the upgrade system, I don't mind this kind of upgrade system, but I guess some people do is that like you have to kind of pick and choose the upgrades you have to you have to use. But eventually you are so experienced that you can just fill out the entire tree, which to me is fine. But a lot of people or like one review in particular I read really had a problem with that, that it wasn't as thoughtful as it seemed in the beginning. In other words, you have to make your choices. And then I mean, that's how I always do it, right? Like",

So for me, it was I put everything into the hook shot. I was or the grappling hook I was using so much. And then when I got Torpedoes, I started putting everything into Torpedoes and ignoring some of the other stuff. And then now that I'm, yeah, making more money, because what you do is you go through, you beat the enemies, they drop gold or silver coins. Uh, your map when you pull out, which I I really love. I know some people want like Axiom Verge has so many hidden secrets and it's you don't you have to leave one or two markers for it. And it's kind of like, oh, man, I saw this. I don't never know how to get to it. This one, once you explore the map and fill it out, you see every treasure chest. You see",

So for it's totally that carrot on the end of the stick of keeping me motivated where it's like, all right, cool. I've, you know, I got the three gems to do this. And now I need to go over there to do that. And I could take this really direct route, but I haven't I haven't been back up there in forever. So let's go. So you go through there and you're getting like gold or silver fish statues or pearls or stuff that give you more more coins. What what with some of the touch you're not a huge Metroidvania fan, right? So you've not played like a vast array of these games, correct? Yeah.

It's not it's not that big. I when you zoom out, you you could look at it and be like, oh my God, it seems like it's huge. But you move so quickly through it. It's it's not again, I don't mean to insulted or anything. It's not baby's first Metroidvania, but it it is like a dumb it is a simple Metroidvania. You can wrap your head suggest that that is the entry. It could be an entry point. But I like that. And that's why it's working for me.

I want to I don't want every game to be like this, but this is a kind of game I was missing and didn't know I was missing where I do want there to be like I'm someone's reading me a story and I'm just participating in it. What's the price point for it? Great question. I think it's 1999. Yeah, okay, cool. And but so what's the deal with the uh with the GameStop? So this is the GameStop publishing label label, right?

They're doing well with them as well, the guys that made The Order. Um, so the game is available only at retail in GameStop stores, but you can buy it digitally on on downloadable services where where it is available. So PSN and Xbox Live. I think it might be Steam game as well. Um, not sure about that. It seems cool. Yeah, Insomniac is a studio I'm very close to, so I I uh it's certainly a game I want to play.

And that's exactly what's happening here, which is interesting, because I really feel the last time I was in a mood and sat down with a game and loved it was Ratchet & Clank, which was the same thing where I woke up on a weekend. I was like, I'm finally ready to play this game and played it for a day. And I was like, this is awesome. This is exactly what I want. Did you beat Ori? No, I never beat Ori. Oh, okay, cool. Because this game it seems kind of similar to that a lot. See the thing about Ori though, right? And this is even what I got from demos and talking to you about it was like in Steimer about it at the time was like how the difficulty spike where you got frustrated like, **** this, you know what I mean? You got mad at the game. I I've never had that. This is 100% like a chill experience. And that's what when I talked about the soundtrack being so good and I talk about",
