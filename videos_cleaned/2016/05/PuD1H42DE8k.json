Nathan says guys I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 5 and a half years and things are still going great. However, I've heard many people say that over time the passion and relationship dies down. My question is what are some ways to keep the fire burning deep in the loins of my relationship for the long term specifically after marriage? Now you're both married, yes, so teach me, teach me some things. Uh, I like to have like we've recently been looking for things to do together like actual activities that aren't the things we brought into the relationship. Um, so for instance like you always hear me talk",

Um, so for instance like you always hear me talk about yoga, right? This sounds silly but like just going and experiencing this thing together and getting better at it together brings us closer. I don't know if it's necessarily stoking the fires of our passion but it definitely is deepening our love for each other which sounds very cheesy but that's honestly the most important thing. What I do actually is and again this isn't it's just really more of an activity but Lindsey and I go to the gym a lot together which is nice and we don't really even work out together but it's more like this thing we do together like you know getting ready in the morning we get our shit together we're going to go blah blah blah we do that and then you know at the gym we really don't spend that much time together but then after the fact it's like you know what'",

The added bonus there is then crazy banging. You both go to the gym. Gym bangs, they're the best gym bangs. You are you doing the bang at the gym? Oh yeah, no, not at the gym, not yet. Would be. Got you have to get your pump, let it settle, then bang. It's the old pump and pump, right? Exactly. There you go. Good. See for me I don't go to the gym so I wouldn't know what that that feels like but I think that it's important to kind of try out the passions of your partner like find out what they're into and at least give it a try. I'm not saying like force yourself to love it or anything but it's just like try to engage with that because I think that that's a it's a fun way to like try something new and show them that you love them. You're you're",

You're you're interested in what they're doing. I I also agree with what Nick said like after a couple years I mean it's it's your best friend, you know what I mean? It's it's everything is just so mundane not in a bad way but in it just like you're used to doing, right? You're used to doing everything together. This assuming you have you know a decent relationship, this is the person more than anyone that would be open to trying something new just like hey, is this is this weird? If you do it and it's weird, whatever, don't do it again. But like, you know, I would say don't feel nervous about talking to somebody but maybe you know, maybe butt stuff, maybe not butt stuff, always butt stuff, who knows? You know what I mean? Not no, not butt stuff for me. No, no, always always, maybe always. So maybe is the most exciting thing.",
