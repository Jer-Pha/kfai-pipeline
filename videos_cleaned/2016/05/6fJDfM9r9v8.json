The first day is going to be a completely ridiculous stage show that we have planned this year, completely blows last year out of the water, and I don't even know how that's possible cuz we were really stupid last year and this year's somehow even stupider. Day two is going to be a full day of meet and greets. We're hanging out with all of us. A bunch of Rooster Teeth people are there, Fun House people are there, Achievement Hunter. It's going to be a grand old time. There's going to be some games to play. There's going to be signings. It's exciting. It's a really fun time. There's going to be exclusive merch.

I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the producer, Seducer Nick Scarpino. Hi. Ballpark, how many heather gray shirts are in your closet? Five, really? At least. Yeah, I agree, at least. It depends. I have some charcoal gray shirts that count as hea. They're not traditional heathering. Yeah, my wife, it's kind of an inside joke to my wife cuz she likes it as well. So half of our closet is heather gray, but we have to separate them, otherwise I might mix one up and wear her shirts and she's significantly smaller than me. It would be, but it would look good cuz you have the ice cream scoops I'm always talking about. There they are. Oh, look at them go. There over there, the pure one, Tim Gettys, some rocky road.

A lot of people say comp, you know, complimentary things. I always respond to those, but some people are just like asking, you know, I got time for everything. No, but one young woman, uh, named Sarah Carpenter wrote us a message and she said she had a boyfriend who's turning 31 years old. His name is Prince Barutzki. Now you realize a real Prince.

So happy 31st birthday, Prince Barutzki from your girlfriend, Sarah Carpenter. Do you think she's related to John Carpenter? No, probably not the band, the Carpenters. No, definitely not my boss, the Jewish Carpenter. Uh, everyone's related to him in somewhere. Do you think that he's related to Prince at all, the musician? That that was really the time that was really the timely name, but this of course is not the surname. So, uh, nonetheless, I don't always do this.

Damn, this is going to be magical ladies and gentlemen. I'm excited about this. I'm going to get out the old my immediate thought what are we making the Uncharted one, two or three four movie criteria? We're making a fresh movie and what we're going to need here.

I mean it's obviously making we're making the entire we're making the trilogy or the quadrilogy. We're making a movie trilogy that doesn't necessarily mean it's based on Uncharted 1, 2, and 3. It's just a trilogy of Uncharted movies. All I'm saying is that there's there's a few characters you have very basic you're going to need them, right? So you need Drake, you need Elena, you need Sully. I would say you also probably need Chloe. Yeah, I say I would say you're even need Cutter. If you need Cutter, I want cut I want Cutter for sure.

Okay, uh, and then we need to we need to identify the villain and that's the big problem. Zavarovich are but we're doing a whole trilogy. We're doing the trilogy trilogy cuz if we're doing the trilogy then it's simple then yeah we're I say we we fold a lot of the elements of one into the story and it's Lavar Lazarovich, Marlo, and now the new guy N and thank you I can't remember",

I will allow you to rid the world of Nadine. I I want Sam though. Sam doesn't need to be there for the first movie, but I do Cameo. I I know I think Sam should be a character from two on. I think that we should get more Sam which then makes him that makes sense more of a character. Okay, okay. I feel like he deserves it. Sam.

This was like first gig and then she got her TV show and everything else. I'm with you. My main my main thing is like, and I love Emily. This isn't a knock against Emily.

We need to worry about putting a huge lead in this that can sell the movie. Like Scarlett Johansson always ScarJo. It's always then Emily Rose should be on the table. Yeah, in term of aging, I'm just saying this is a huge movie. We're going to we're producing this Kinda Funny co-production with whoever the **** else owns the rights, which I assume at this point PlayStation is it PlayStation so I assume Sony's gonna produce it the movie theater or the Sony doesn't matter Studios.
