It's a great character. Sly's a great character. Yeah, Sly's awesome. I think the Ratchet and Clank games are better than Sly Cooper but I think Sly Cooper is a better character than Ratchet and Clank. I'll give you that. I agree with that 100%.

Oh yeah no I don't think that it's going to be them. I just think that they have a directive to keep it open and I think that was a really clever way to keep it open.

I think there's no doubt about that. I still think that it's way overstated that they get to do whatever they want to do and they're not paying the bills. Sony owns that studio and owns that IP sure and if they go in and say like you need to do something to keep this open you don't have to work on it anymore but like if we want to go back to this we need to have a way to go back to it and I think that that's what they did.
