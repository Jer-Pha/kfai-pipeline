First off, as normal, we're going to do one of these reviews but spoiler-free in the beginning, then we get into the spoilers. So real quick, going around table, Greg, did you like it? Yeah. Nick? Yes, I liked it. I liked it a lot too. So in a very spoiler-free esque way, let's talk about this for a second. Yeah, sure. I mean, I think my first surprise was that I was pleasantly surprised. It was not Age of Ultron in that Age of Ultron felt like nothing really mattered and it was just kind of a filler story and there was no really like, it was a lot grander than it was, it should have been. Really nothing really mattered at the end and the whatever. This actually had a lot more heart to it, a lot more storytelling. It was a lot, it sounds weird especially with all the Avengers fighting, but it was a lot smaller of a story and I liked that a lot and it incorporated a lot",

This is not supposed, I think you've seen them on the trailer, but a lot of deader characters that you didn't really think would come back or be pertinent and they were able to, I think, integrate them in a way that was very fulfilling. Yeah, I think overall it was pretty natural and there was only a couple instances that I was like, okay, this is a little bit forced. Um, and I think that the the plot overall, it did a good job of guiding things from place to place and like kind of moving it on. It was very all over the place in a classic comic book way, but I think that uh, it it wasn't until the end that I was like, okay, like things kept happening and I kept going, so what, so what, so what, so what?

I it's hard, it's hard to talk in in vague terms, but I do want to dive into the actual storytelling and the actual like motivations behind what's going on, the nefarious sort of deeds that are being done behind the scenes. Um, I liked all motivations that was behind. Yeah, I mean, and I was going to say that too. I liked, I liked that it wasn't, I don't, I don't think that everything needs to be as grandiose as end The Avengers or yeah, the end of the world. Like, just we don't need that all the time and I'm glad that this wasn't that.

But I get, and I was assuming they would kind of shoehorn Bucky in, the whole thing was going to be kind of about him, but it kind of wasn't and I liked that. And when he was in it, you actually did kind of care about him because up until this point, I didn't give a **** about Bucky. Yeah, I just didn't care. Like in Captain America: Winter Soldier, I was like, God, this character is so bad. But then we see them, they spend more time together.

Captain America 2 is definitely second place in my total ranking of the Marvel movies. Avengers is, you know, number one for sure. Um, but I think Captain America 2 is really wouldn't have found its footing for what a Captain America movie means and I think it's way more character-driven and it is way smaller of a story and I I was concerned about this being, is this Avengers?

It was always very, very tight-knit and very about propelling each of the character storylines forward in a way that didn't, wasn't leaps and bounds for the from where they started, but was you, there was a starting point and an end point that made sense contextually within the movie. Sure. For me, I mean, that was my like the ah to me is that it was the Captain America movie because I like, I'm totally hypocrite. Like the people complaints people always love about Superman, I love about Captain America. I just find him, and I love Chris Evans' portrayal of him, don't get me wrong, but I find him incredibly two-dimensional and I just don't have anything I really connect with this character on other than he's fighting the good fight, which I get, but like",

I do think in the like, I'll start this off by saying, I think that this, so now we're in spoilers. Yes, we are now totally in spoilers. I think that this moved, changed ranking and this is now number two. It goes Avengers and then this. I do think that there's still a far gap between Avengers and this.

It didn't feel like a Captain America story because Tony Stark is so prevalent in it and that's what I liked about it. And I will disagree with you on slightly. He is two-dimensional as a character, but I thought his motivations in this were interesting and that's what you never see with Superman, right? Like Superman's always sort of like truth, justice, and the American way. He goes against the government because of something he believes in. I think there a very strong motivation for a character to have and it should be what's what what always fascinating to me about the Civil War concept is that it should have been opposite, right?

I'm Tony Stark, I'm Iron Man, now wants to be accountable. I mean, they they moved it in. We have that the character development in the last few films where he's kind of gone through the traumatic experience. We see that these guys are getting bombarded by stuff, but it's just so weird that that's where those roles were. See, but I feel like what you're saying makes sense.

It was just like, well, what if the policies change or whatever? I'm like, yo, ****, like they're making some points here, maybe you should be listening. I think the I think the difference there is that like Captain America wasn't down with it, you know? Captain America was the one against it. Iron Man wasn't involved in all that stuff, you know? And I know that like they're a team, but it's like he was outside still and he was dealing with all of his traumatic ****, right? And it wasn't then they had the Age of Ultron situation, all that.

I thought it had a really nice dynamic between the two. The I mean, my favorite parts of the movie are all of Spider-Man stuff and then it was and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. And then it was the one scene, uh, it was every scene, I should say, of uh Falcon with Bucky when they were, will you move your seat up? No. And then they're sitting there and they like have that reaction to like Captain America kissing the girl and then after the Spider-Man when they're lying, I really, I hate you.

There was no joke that made me go like, uh, because Age of Ultron had a couple that I was like, oh man, language. Yeah, I didn't like that. Yeah, no, I don't like language either. Um, but I thought all the jokes really hit in this and uh, like Spider-Man, come on, man. Like he's obviously that such a standout of like, holy ****, why isn't this whole movie that?

Um, and I I just expected him to sound different and act different. So it took a second for me to adjust um to my head. And um, I I've heard good things about Spider-Man in this movie and was like, oh, this is the best Spider-Man. This is the best Peter Parker. I didn't necessarily get that this is the best Peter Parker. Um, I see, I I thought it felt the most natural Peter Parker at at first blush based on what, 15, 20 minutes of him being Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Like him fumbling for words with Tony in there, their whole interplay of like the, you know, with the costume and stuff.

So about Peter specifically, not with the Spider-Man aspects, with the Peter aspects. I I feel like he was uh a little had a little bit too much personality. Um, just in the sense of I would expected him to be a bit more subdued based on how much everyone's talking up how much better this Peter Parker is than the other Peter Parker. I thought it wasn't bad at all. I really liked it, but I don't think that they nailed the Peter Parker character. Spider-Man on the other hand, yeah, best best by far, man.

Which is how weird is it that we live in a world where they can make those references because they're owned by the same company now. Good. He would have never seen that like five years ago. It's ridiculous. Um, no, I mean, obviously the two standout, the two standout moments for me, uh, was everything that had to do with Spider-Man. And I got, but I got to be honest, like as awesome as Spider-Man is, and I actually forgot that Paul Rudd was in the movie because there's so many **** people in this movie.

That was the thing why it worked so well is that, you know, up until then it was a more not dark, but it was a very serious, morose Captain America movie. And then we we immediately inject Spider-Man and Ant-Man and they get to be comic relief and be funny and say stuff is awesome. He's like, who's talking right now? He's like, it's your conscience. We don't talk that much. Yeah. Oh my God. So I I actually think that uh Ant-Man was even better than Spider-Man. I thought Spider-Man was **** great, but like, yeah, I thought Ant-Man, Ant-Man the movie, it was good. I enjoyed it a lot, but like, and it had its moments, it was really funny.

Yeah, I mean, they they have a relationship. Um, but it's awesome in this movie. Like the the first scene when he like walks in, she's like, I told you not to do that. It's like that instantly gives like a weird sexual tension between them. And then throughout the movie, you just kind of, I thought it, I I just thought I was like, ah, funny ghost man.
