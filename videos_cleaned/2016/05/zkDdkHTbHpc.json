The second one, when the his girlfriend's head got blown off. See, that's awesome. That's more than you remember from most movies. Is it? Yeah, no. Hey, speaking of movies, yeah, real quick.

The Boston accents were pretty on point though. I uh I will say then and then the next night I rented Concussion, which I was actress. It was fine.
