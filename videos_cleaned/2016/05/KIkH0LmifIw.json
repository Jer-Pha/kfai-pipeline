I feel like that's Resident Evil. Resident Evil as we know it didn't control well. The story got **** crazy all the time.

There's like a role where sometimes you can't pop a headshot and blow up the head on one hit, but it's not every time. It's like I I want to be in that zombie universe that way.

And we see with games like Outlast and Layers of Fear and uh that a big one I'm forgetting, Slender, no, whatever, that people want to be scared again. P.T., Soma, people want to be scared by games again. And so if you came out and actually made a real zombie game and again kept it simple but made it work, yeah, I think the narrative thing is the the main thing that you're hitting on that uh separates Resident Evil from those other ones. Like the other they all have stories, but I do think that, you know, Resident Evil people remember Resident Evil 1 as being a story based game.",

There's definitely a cool story to be told. I think, you know, the one thing I disagree with Greg is like the linearity. Like part of one of the hallmarks I think of survival horror is nonlinearity. Um, I can't think of a survival horror game that is linear. Um, that like even going back to Sweet Home and stuff like that.

Not so much in Resident Evil 4 because it's way more open, but I still think it's like one of the whole like that game because it dared to be what it was. I think it gets away with it or whatever. It's actually wide open when you really look at the environments, the town and the Pueblo and all these kind of things. This is cool. Has like almost like a Jason kind of feel to it in a way.

It's probably a better setting than even the Ishimura or the Mansion, um, because it's so big that it's **** creepy because you're alone. Yeah, so empty. Um, and so you're alone except for the Big Daddies and Little Sisters and like some of the Splicers, but you're pretty much much alone. And so I I want to see some sort of fusion of those kinds of things. But if I in terms of like Biohazard, in terms of Resident Evil, like what I really want from it being a fan of the series or an old fan of the series, not so much anymore, is um something may be more akin to uh a fusion of Four and Dead Space.

I refused to play Six because Five was so disappointing to me was and that's where I get with franchise of love where I'm like, I you know, I've seen enough. Take my stand is they made a mistake. Capcom made a mistake with Resident Evil 5 thinking that they needed to respond to the way where the market was when they didn't realize that that particular IP is what everyone responds to. And Dead Space is a response to it. Dead Space is definitely a response to Resident Evil, sure. Um, Outlast is a response to the feel of Resident Evil, the the scariness.

I **** love that. I hate that ****. Like I I think like making the game part of part of what was cool about the early Resident Evil games was that they were **** hard. Like you could beat through the game, but if you ratcheted up the difficulty level and you didn't use your ink ribbons and all that kind of stuff, like I love the idea of being like, you can't save.

I think one of the things we've lost in in games, um, is consequences. I was thinking about that when I was playing Alienation recently, which is a great Housemarque game, but there are no consequences for dying at all. And and I love the idea of like, you have seven ink ribbons. You can save seven times. You better figure out exactly how you want to do it because that's all. And by the way, you have to find them.

And that's why Resident Evil has the camera. You know, that's why Outlast I think really nails it too. Like with with the lighting of the the video camera. So it's like I I think that it needs that.

Keegan Andrew says hey gentlemen and Tim ah I got you yeah regarding my Wii U I have a Wii U and I don't remember the last time I played it I loved it when I first got it playing all the hot games Mario Kart, Captain Toad and so on my question is should I wait to sell it or get rid of it closer to the NX launch nope I know GameStop likes to give extra credit when you trade in a console from old gen to next-gen or should I get rid of it now I'm sure I could sell it on Craigslist for more money don't sell your Hardware that's my my advice I never sell how yeah my thing is I I'm a big fan of keeping",

I did but I refused to pay anything in it right I would have gladly paid them $20 for that game but since they made made me not pay for it I was like I'm not pay any **** um and it ruined the game it it kind of like Plants I was so excited for Plants vs. Zombies 2 like through the roof excited for it and uh yeah it annoyed me I have no experience I'm totally averse to the model the model is predatory the model is wrongheaded it's **** stupid people",
