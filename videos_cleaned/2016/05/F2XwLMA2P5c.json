You shouldn't have said it on episode 70. I think it's over now it's done. Episode 69 was that that that was that. And it's on to the next thing. But that's my thing I'm so nostalgic Greg. You are nostalgic. If you want to open in topic one of episode 71 was the four best moments from episode 69 that would make sense. See that's a Tim Gettys' ass move.

No one uses the backslash button. Backslash is like a made up bold thing. I know where it is on the keyboard and it's for programming I think but you don't... No one's getting confused on that. You don't use that button. It's like the tilde. Nick insists on saying forward slash as if anyone is confused. Nick is also the type of person to talk about AOL keyboards.

We didn't do enough to do a review. First impressions. This is just gonna be what do you think? I've just been busy with those guys. So what I was thinking about this when you brought this topic the interesting thing about these particular games is that they're both games that had very tortured developments. And what I think...

It was announced in 2008 and they scrapped it and they made it again. And that's how we got Doom. And Homefront... I mean Homefront was so old that THQ still existed and announced this game. And people forget Montreal. THQ Montreal was developing it. Then it was kicked over to European studios like Crytek then Crytek owned it then Crytek went under started their studio went under then Crytek UK became Dambusters. And then the game was sold to Koch Media and Koch Media owns Deep Silver. And then it became an open world game. And so I thought it was interesting that these games coming out the same week really a few days apart they didn't come out technically the same week Doom came out first but that they both come from this tortured lineage.

And that's not a huge surprise but I think I had more expectations for it. So my... Do you think that's on a personal level or in industry level? Yeah it's a personal level I think because I just think the original Homefront Kaos Studios Kaos Studios was a very rare New York City based studio and they are the ones that made the original Homefront were shuttered even though the original Homefront sold like three and a half million copies. So I was like that's kind of bullshit.

I enjoy the original Homefront. I'm not even a shooter fan. Yeah I like I love shooters and I love obviously these Red Dawn type games and that are kind of rare and few and far between. And I enjoyed it. I wanted more of it which is usually a compliment for a game. I thought it was very short. And then they had a multiplayer that you know when you talk about it with people they were quite into it. They enjoy I enjoyed the multiplayer.

Anyway so this game is you know I was always intrigued by this new game. And what I'm realizing from it is that it seems to be preliminarily very half baked. This is a game that clearly was tortured clearly maybe should have come out a while ago. Doesn't look very good certainly on PlayStation 4. It doesn't run very well. PC apparently is a disaster according to Jim Sterling who we trust very much. You watched that video yet? No I haven't watched it yet. It's awesome. He has this video up and he put it up at the one the Homefront embargo lifted.

And then my PlayStation just made the choice for me. It spit the disc out. I was like oh you don't want to play this anymore? I put it back in. I was like all right we'll play it. It's like serendipity. We'll start Ratchet & Clank. But Jim put up a review. His tweet was just everything you need to know about Homefront. And that's what he called the video. And it's just two and a half three minutes of characters running in slow motion for no reason in the game running into walls and just continuing to run in the walls. There's this female character on the ground and her neck's all distended like a worm. And he walks over it and then his leg starts to distend and go",

And actually one of my major problems with it is that its story is just kind of nonsense. And I know that that's easy to say but why isn't that a complaint with the original Homefront? The original Homefront story is similar in that North Korea somehow consolidates power after the Korean War kind of becomes more powerful than South Korea because a lot of people forget that in real history North Korea was actually more prosperous than South Korea until the 70s. So North Korea was actually doing better with the help of the Soviet Union and all that kind of stuff.

And I remember when I worked at IGN as I've said in the past I wrote this piece talking to ex-CIA agents about like how could this happen? This is ridiculous. How can this happen? And they walked me through like very specific things have to happen but this is how this might occur that like North Korea which can't even feed its own people instead became this military powerhouse that actually invades the United States. And I'm like OK. And I liked kind of the story. It was unorthodox but interesting in this in this new one the new one pretends that the original Homefront never happened which to me doesn't make any sense because the original Homefront sparks a revolution and",

So A that doesn't make any sense. B they rewrite the story so that there's a North Korean corporation called Apex that basically starts to dominate. They become like the Silicon. North Korea basically becomes Silicon Valley in the 70s. They create the personal computer. They create the microchip. They create smart tablets. And so it creates this whole thing and weapons. And we start buying everything from them. But mysteriously in the decades that we've been buying everything from them they've introduced back doors and all the technology and they shut everything off.

This wasn't even like a clever thing. They shut everything off and now everything doesn't work. And then the North Koreans basically invade. And that's basically the foundation of the story. And there's like an economic collapse and all this kind of stuff. And I'm like all right so that's absurd. But isn't it just absurd in a different way? Because I mean it's one of those like the Homefront original storyline is a little absurd like you pointed out. Like you talked to these Cylons. Very specific things that happen.

Of course I loved Homefront period. The original Homefront's intro was even better I thought because it was here's the geopolitical forces of how this would go and where it would go. Whereas this was just a gruff voice giving you a rundown of they made the smartphone and then they turned everything off. Like this is just Dark Angel motherfucker. So my assumption is that in the story at some point China must have been the bad guy. And if not and I feel that way about the original Homefront too. And there's like some...

And you're hung up like wait why how could they do this? And then like... I don't know that it's that small of a number.

There is a darkness and a direness to it to the revolution and all these kinds of things. I think that's great but everything about it is just kind of like not very good from what I can tell.

And that was the cool thing that people forgot about the heritage about Doom is the open maps. Like people forget like Doom is a really important shooter.

Eddie Eddie speaking during his investor day event EA studios boss Patrick Soderlund talked about how Star Wars Battlefront while generally well received was criticized for its lack of a single player campaign. He also teased that a future installment might include a campaign. He started off by explaining it was a purposeful decision to leave out a campaign for Battlefront in part so that the team at DICE would get it out in time for the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The game is based on the original Star Wars trilogy but it did have content based on Jakku a setting from the new movie.

Quote the one thing that we get criticized on was the lack of a single player campaign. It was a conscious decision we made due to time and being able to launch the game side by side with the movie that came out to get the strongest possible impact. I think the team created a really good game based on the premise that we had. I'd say the game was done very well for us and reached a very different demographic than a traditional EA game. So from that perspective it's a success. Are we happy with the 75 rating? No. Is that something we're going to cure going forward? Absolutely. So yeah then the game had missions.

We have to go back and course correct that for another version if we were ever to build one. The future Battlefront game would need to offer more depth and breadth. We had designed it to be much more accessible product to a wide age group. So an eight year old could play with his father on the couch as well as a teenager or a 20 year old could play the game and enjoy it.

In fact legendary game designer really reached a batch of Pikmin short films in 2014 the same year during all those Sony leaks a hack revealed that Spider-Man producer Avi Arad was in negotiations with Nintendo to produce an animated Super Mario Bros. movie which would have been through Sony Pictures and that would have been interesting. And then last year there was those Netflix rumors about the Zelda series that are not panning out. What do you think?",

EA doesn't do anything else. Obviously these companies diversify in some ways but um but doing this industry is a unique beast and you have to have you know specialty in doing that.

So I don't think it's a safe space for a lot of companies to be in. That's my opinion. No I mean we did a whole topic about it right? I think it's also just Disney being smart and coming to that realization that we could be doing other things and we are really good at other things and we should do those things and partnering with people who do these video games really well.
