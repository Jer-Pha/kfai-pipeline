Colin, what have you been playing recently on that there PlayStation Vita? Odin Sphere Leifthrasir. I have no idea how to pronounce. I never heard anyone actually say it, so I don't know. I'm say sounds right. Like the game Rausers, remember that Lof Trousers game where you played in like the L.V. Basically, it's a port of the PS2 classic, the very late PS2 release, Odin Sphere, but with some new bells and whistles. It's a remake, right? Yeah, I mean, it looked great. It looked great to begin with. Let's be clear. 100%. This is one of those things about this is what I always think about with Odin Sphere is how much I like playing it on PS2 and how obsessed M was when I first came to IGN. It was one of those games that got there. We were all playing it. It was it was one of the last gasps of the PlayStation 2 as well, right? Because PlayStation 3 was already out then it",

Because PlayStation 3 was already out then it was God of War and then we were done with it. So yeah, we have here the Storybook Edition. Thought we'd unbox it. Of course, game's out June 7th. This is the PlayStation 4 edition worth pointing out, not cross-buy PlayStation 4 Vita, but it is cross-save, one of those games. So it's exactly like when Atlus did Dragon's Crown 100%. And in this game was I guess it was Dragon's Crown always reminded me of Odin Sphere Leifthrasir going across beating the hell out everything. So there we go. Still beautiful there. Beautiful on the back here. Beautiful, beautiful. Got your little map there, right? You're going to know all these places soon, won't you? Does he go around? Smells good too. It does. Oh, it smells really good. I like that new that new Collector's Edition smell, Storybook Edition smell. So pop it off here. Get going. Pop it",

So pop it off here. Get going. Pop it off. Pop it off. It's popping off. All right, so what do you got there, Colin? We got let's see, a steel case for the game. That's actually like a little sleeve. Yeah, like a sleeve. I like this because it's not it doesn't screw it up. If you want your PlayStation 4 collection to look like your PlayStation 4 collection, great. If you want that steelbook look, there it is. Yeah, that's actually nice. I don't that's probably existed at some other time in some other collection, but I've never seen it. No, well, you know, and then uh Odin Sphere of the game for PS4 here as you can see. No no insert at all. Nothing. They they know what you're here for. They want to get you right to the meat of the matter. Beautiful box art. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. These are all Ryan Clements' references. We like him a lot. All we got a T-shirt.",

You see somebody on the street with this, you're like, you are a straight up dork and I like you, sir. What's your trophy level count? And they will tell you immediately because that is a big deal to People Like Us. Now here's the big question. Adult large. Why you got to why you got to exclude Team Fat? I would love to wear a shirt like this. Be a huge dork, but I can't can't do it. You're not a big enough nerd. Got some beautiful got some big but you're not a big enough nerd. You're too big as a human being. Sure, but I like Odin Sphere. Why is that? Why can't I be that nerd? We got some nice art here. This is the Alice and Socrates art print, right? Exactly. Yes.

And then here we go. The big one for fans. This is the 64-page hardcover art book. Go through there. Now we're to open up Leifthrasir. Smells good too. Oh, it does. They know what they're doing here. Getting high off that. They're they're packaging in the PS2 Nostalgia. Look it un open. Look, they got words in there. Now we're going to read it all to you right now. Here comes uh let me tell you about oh this this is the introduction of course. Thank you for purchasing Odin Sphere Leifthrasir. Still nothing. I'm George Kamitani, director of the original Odin Sphere, which was released on May May 17th, 2007 for PlayStation 2. It goes on like this. You understand very late. The art book. You see all this stuff. You see all these",

You see all this stuff. You see all these beautiful characters. Some of them are buxom. That happens occasionally with a VanillaWare game. An action RPG. Velvet here talking about Destiny over all this stuff. Uh you've been playing it, Colin. What do you think Odin Sphere? I love it. I mean, it's a great game. Uh it's uh you know, it has that spirit of the VanillaWare games, the hack-and-slash kind of thing. If you've played uh Muramasa, if you've played obviously Dragon's Crown. I mean, the these are very familiar kinds of games. They make very similar kinds of games, not only in the art style. Obviously, the art style is indicative of Dragon's Crown. Obviously, it's you know, it's the same same kind of game earlier game. Uh but it's a fantastic game. I think it it holds up. I think a lot of games like that that are not too complicated mechanically but have deep systems",

I think a lot of games like that that are not too complicated mechanically but have deep systems um do hold up better than games that you know might be of the time mechanically and stuff like that. So uh even though this is a very late PS2 game and it might seem a little vintage to some people, especially people that never played it, I think it holds up well as if the game was made today. How does it play on Vita? Plays great. Okay. I have no problem. I have no doubt it plays awesome on PS4. You know, you get these sometimes you get these Vita/PS4 ports. You're never sure. You yeah, it's not it's I mean, it's it might run or load better on PS4. I can't compare because I've not played it on PS4. Sure. Dragon's Crown had a similar problem where it was probably better on PS3 than it was on Vita, but it was totally competent, totally fine on PS3 or on Vita rather. And I think it's probably going to be the same the same",

Uh I'll probably take the PS4 game. Okay. I think we have codes for that. I'll probably take it. Well, why don't we I think we could put this all into a Kinda Funny Live Prize Box. twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames. We give stuff away. I think I'm probably going to take all of it actually. No, well, all right. Maybe some of it'll be there. Maybe some of it won't. But you don't know, ladies and gentlemen. Are you excited for Odin Sphere Leifthrasir? Let us know in the comments below. And of course, subscribe to the channel. Keep coming back. And no, that's been our pleasure to serve you. Oh, the game's out June 7th, if you didn't know.
