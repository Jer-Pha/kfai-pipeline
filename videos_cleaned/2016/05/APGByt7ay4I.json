You need to ask permission for here and you need to beg for here. Like that's the thing. Really beg. Like I have to beg or they have to beg. Any as long as someone's begging. Okay, what about like like here? Well, you want to avoid this but like this little the little like where it starts the valley. Yeah, you want to get in there about no stay away from the hair. Always stay away from the hair. I don't know that I'm comfortable. No, it'll so Barbara, Nick, yes, today's question gets a little bit risque, but I feel like we got the right person for the job. So this comes from 3-year-old Carlos. Carlos says, hey, I'm interested in ejaculating on my girlfriend, but I'm not sure how to bring it up to her. Is this okay? Yes. Yeah, next question. Yeah, I know, right? That's it's a simple yes. Again, obviously communication. You got to get in there. You got to make sure that she's comfortable with",

You got to make sure that she's comfortable with whatever it is, but there's options there. Yeah, see, I think here's the deal. If you're if you're having sex and this is something you want to do, if you want to say pull out and you want to let the boy, you know, the the fire hose spray where it may needs spray, I would say to start, make sure it stays south of the Rockies, right? You got the Colorado Rockies. Don't go above the Rockies. Don't try to sum ever right here like on the chest because then you're you're you're risking the sort of like the splash then the Ricochet into the hair into the eyes and no one wants that. Like that's that's the perfect way to ruin an orgasm when you're just like, oh, this feels so great. Boom, **** I have to the hospital like instant regret right there it is. So I would say start with the stomach line, okay, or if she's",

So I would say start with the stomach line, okay, or if she's turned over maybe the back line somewhere on that line and see how she responds to it. Here's the thing though, Sean, little known fact, I don't know little known fact, actually a lot of people might know this. It's actually very good for the skin. So know that, you know, if you want to have nice skin on your wrists over there, I would say just go for go for the face. See, here's my thing. I feel like you shouldn't just go for any of this stuff. Like I feel like even the stomach, even the the lower back, even all of that stuff, you should at least have a conversation about it of like, hey, what's your comfort level with? See, I think on this one, this is the one time where I'm going to say no. I think this the surprise of it can be like a big turn on like especially especially if there's if again the Navy Seals",

I think this the surprise of it can be like a big turn on like especially especially if there's if again the Navy Seals are doing their magic, right? Or if she's using her Navy Seals to do her magic and you're about close and she's about close and you take it out boom, that could be a very very cool thing for her. But again, not if it goes straight into her eye and she just **** shoots up and darts into a door. You don't want that to happen. Okay, so so Barber like let's get a little a little bit so taking it above the the Rockies going straight to the face what are the thoughts there? Uh, I definitely would recommend that you discuss this with your partner. I don't know when the right time to do that really is though. I think it might be something that they have to bring up on their own. Yeah, um, but some people think it's like a really sexy thing to get a facial and so that's the thing Nick have you ever experience this",

I mean, I've had a facial and like trying when they go and they like pluck out your pores, but I've never had some facializ me delivered a facial. Oh, that's what you're talking about. Uh, yeah, I have I have in the past and she and that was one of those times where she actually asked for it and I was like, who am I to deny this person what she wants? Well, she just like come on my face. Yeah, she was like I want you to and I'm like okay well we'll do I'm here to service. Yeah, I think let's go the The Generation that that we are growing up in now we're porn in the Internet is just a thing that is our life some over there. I feel like things have changed, you know, like Nick I think your generation was a little bit different where that that was a little bit more well it wasn't",

I feel like things have changed, you know, like Nick I think your generation was a little bit different where that that was a little bit more well it wasn't something that women necessarily knew was a thing, right? And so I think when you're exposed to these like images or these Concepts younger on you're a little bit more open to them for sure. Usually women from my experience like it because it makes them feel sexy makes them feel wanted, you know, you're kind of covering them in your excitement. Mhm. Um, but definitely ask if you're going to go above the Rockies. I agree covering them in your excitement is the best way to end any video ever. Barbara, thank you so much. Where can people find you?
