It's going to be a grand old time. There's going to be some games to play, there's going to be signings. It's it's exciting. It's a really fun time. There's going to be exclusive merch.

Yeah, I want to introduce my kid to gaming. Okay, what should I show them to set them down the path of greatness? There's a big question. I know and it's I like this is another reason I'm glad I don't have kids because I never have to worry about this, you know what I mean? But kids bring this the people this comes up a lot and I I'm always I don't know it's you know your child better, you know what I mean? Like think about it this way, right?

I don't think it's necessarily wrong that well my kid loves **** Ninja Turtles and you're like what's the best Ninja Turtles game on the market right now and you give them that to see if they like the buttons and they like what's happening and then start expanding the pallet. Yeah, you know your child better than I do believe it or not and so I don't know his atten his or her attention span or how it all works out that way. That's what gets weird.

I don't think I think there's a whole bunch of other things that could be but I think Mario is the right answer. Um then the question becomes which one do you go with the modern one or you go with the original one? There's definitely a train of thought that is oh they need to know where things came from. I think that's the wrong train of thought. I think you need to work backwards for that. I think they will appreciate Mario 1 and Mario 3 and Mario World at some point if they get there that's the setting them down the right path. I think Mario 3D World is actually a really great one because they can wrap their head around it pretty easily and it's pretty and it's cute and it looks great.
