It was beat out okay I think so sorry I'm not up to speed on the subject I can't but it it is tough it's a complex issue but I mean the thing is like the medicine lining to me is that you know three people who are transgendered and you are in your 17 years old when I was 17 years old I don't know any gay people there was not even one person who would who felt confident coming out in high school nobody knew people that you know I was in theater and band so it was a little bit more of an accepting culture and so you knew people that you would there was a due assumptions that could be made and you weren't you know non-judgmental but you were like okay I'm pretty sure that person's one way or an honor you know and eventually",

I, 'cause I, 'cause I was homeschooling, I live fairly close to the school, but from what I saw, it was like unfortunately close to 50-50, more leaning towards the other, sure, sure. But not that being said, it wasn't like 50-50 being like, \"I hate transgender people,\" then 50-50 and the other half being like, \"Yeah, I love trans.\" Let me put it in terms that like, yeah, and I don't mean to make light of it, but it's just, it's an interesting, funny way to put a humorous way to put it. We talked about VR all the time, right? Now VR is like one of these things where it's like, it's hard to show what it means to play VR. Would it be in VR? You have to kind of play it, you have to kind of know it. And to me, it's like, okay, we know transgender people, right? We tend when I moved, when I, and and I was talking about, you know, the gay marriage thing, whenever I lived with a bunch of gay men in a house.",

I'm like, this is what, you know, part this subculture might be about. Let me learn about this. Let me understand this perspective. I'd never had this perspective before and it taught me a great deal about that. And I think that the VR reference here is interesting because it's like the transgender thing doesn't make sense to change anything, but it's like, oh, did you know that your friend Barry that you haven't seen in five years is now now identifies as a woman?

Everyone's happy. They're just trying to be humans and they're just trying to function in society.

And then we moved into this very sudden and as Greg said, almost jarring struggle for transgender rights.

It's a cop-out move. It is a cop-out move of the fear of not understanding them, then making this boogeyman. Those creepy men and women already exist. You talk about this creeper in the men's room.

That's why I'm confident that the transgender struggle will be ended and solved way quicker than the gay struggle, which is somewhat quicker than the the black issue in America. For the most part, that's just our access to each other now, right? And the ability to talk to each other and the ability of, I, you know, I remember this is freaking history freaking for you that you have to read about, but remember when Real World: San Francisco happened?

You get to change quicker. Yeah, still painful. And I think that we just go a long way with accepting each other. I mean, like, there's a lot of reasons to judge a person and there are a lot of reasons to hate a person even, but there's not, but it shouldn't be based on these like very fundamental aspects of a person's being, you know?
