Upon recording this I I think I edited the last thing I that Tim uh the master wanted me to edit. He just gave me a list of **** and was like go into a hole for a week and a half and edit it. Um I hope it was a good show. I bet it was Looks like it's going to be a great show. There's no way this show can fail. I always like to say too big to fail right? Pong Island. Yeah everything's too big to fail. Just like Enron. Yeah. Enron is not really the one we're thinking about when we talk about too big to fail but I think it was Well not really.

How old are you? 17. 17 years old. Not even not even able to vote buy cigarettes or I guess you can get a prostitute but why would you want to do that? I guess I there's not really a legal age for that right Greg? I guess. I don't know. I almost picked up a prostitute. I didn't know she was prostitute.

Um good education good scholastics. Um and it is not not known for its good-looking view. Oh okay. Okay. Yes. Yes. So there's it has a little bit of a stigma in a good way. If a stigma can be good Colin can I get a ruling on that? I assume so. It's like the word omen. Yeah. You could have a good omen but omens typically aren't bad. Well it's it's it's got a stigma to it that happens to coincide with hot people namely women. That's that's what I'm interested in. Okay. But to each his own. To each his or her own. Thank you.

For just some I got sick with whooping cough for like six months and just couldn't finish out the rest of the year.

I think we're at that place as a society and as a society we're at a place where there is just too much noise there and you have to start training people how to deal with it.

And like if you took 0 minutes in your day and just sat with yourself and breathed and there was no outside stimulation there was nothing to worry about.

That was the question. Oh this is a good the strawberry. There's there's two problems with the strawberry. I think the strawberry is too big but the strawberry you can't also eat the entire strawberry. So you have a scrap afterwards. What are you going to do? Are you going to put it back in the box? That's what I would say. You just bury it in the bottom and tuck the rest. That's what I would say is the barrier. If you can finish the whole thing with no remnants in one bite. Wow. Interesting.

I'm telling you in the '90s and certainly before that in the 80s and everything we were not eating avocados on the East Coast. They were not a thing. And like I remember seeing them in the supermarket and they were **** ridiculously expensive. Like I I remember them being like 5 6 a piece in like the '90s. Like no one was eating avocados.

Like and the color of that apparently indicates how like how good or not is like you shouldn't squeeze it. I always squeeze it and he's like you should really gauge it based on that thing. It's too complicated. I feel if you pop the top though isn't going to accelerate going back. I don't know. You have to ask Raone. I didn't follow up with him on that question. Going back to my original topic it's a win-win at that point because you look at it like No I was going to say if you look at it it's not right.

I mean you know the bulk bin I think that that's the rule for the bulk bin is and that's why you say it out loud is that it has to be a new thing. The first time I remember I ever went to a Whole Foods or whatever and they had the strawberry yogurt covered pretzels in a bulk bin. I was like \"What the fuck?\" And I ate like one. I'm like \"Yeah.\" And bought a giant bag of them. And then again I can't I don't feel like I can comfortably go back in there and be like I don't know what this is going to taste like anymore. Now I know. Like when I remember when we did that stream they're going to remember you checking the camera. He was here on October 3rd. It's a part of your internal pride here folks. Are you going to honest? Those pretzels aren't free. They got to get in there.
