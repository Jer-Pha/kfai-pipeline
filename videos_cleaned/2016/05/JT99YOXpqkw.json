What we have planned this year completely blows last year out of the water, and I don't even know how that's possible 'cause we were really stupid last year and this year's somehow even stupider. Day two, it's going to be full day of meet and greets. We're hanging out with all of us. A bunch of Rooster Teeth people are there, Funhaus people are there, Achievement Hunter. It's going to be a grand old time. There's going to be some games to play, there's going to be signings. It's exciting, it's a really fun time. There's going to be exclusive merch. Oh yeah, there's definitely going to be exclusive merch. Go to KindaFunny.com/tickets to get your tickets today. There's a couple VIP tickets still available, so make sure if you want one of those, you act fast.

You can watch it later at a different time. You get forward in the next, so we're spoil, we're taking the muzzles off spoil. I'm just saying this just in case, who knows? Seriously, I have a feeling it will in certain aspects. First off, I want to say that this topic is brought to you by our Patreon producer, Stephen Inler. Stephen, thank you so much for making the show happen over at Patreon.com/KindaFunny. Uncharted 4, so he knows he's getting his Patreon shout out here. Oh, I'm sure he did. Stephen Inler is the **** homie. Also, it's brought to you by all you other people on Patreon, so thank you, thank you very, very much.

So the topic, topic to quit dilly-dallying, shilly-shallying, as they say. I don't think anyone's ever said that. That's Rikku from Final Fantasy X. That was a direct quote for anybody, all the millions of people out there that love localization there. Yeah, dilly-dally, shilly-shally, ship it. I think it was like a point, actually. Anyways, ranking the Uncharted games. We now have four of them that we're talking about here. We're not going to include, we're including Golden Abyss. Fine, sure, we can include Golden Abyss. Then we're also including, we're not including Fortune, but I want to give a shout out to the new mobile game that came out. It's supposed to be pretty good. It's pretty good.

So I want to have a big discussion. We were going to do this last week, sure, but we decided to give some people time to beat it. I'm assuming most of you by now have beat this game. We've had some time, let it sink in and stuff. Yeah, hit me, hit me, Greg. I still, I feel like I said in the review, I still feel, I feel this is unfair to an extent.

Let's talk about how the story and the gameplay compare and da da da da da. And the fact that they, each one of them, that each one of them felt like a definitive story that like, because it was always the thing with Uncharted 2 and 3, right? Where it's like, sure, you could jump into those and play them and get a lot out of them, not as always, not as much as if you knew everything, but for the most part, pretty self-contained, other than the fact that Elena and Drake are always broken up and why are they broken up?

It seems unfair. And especially, it's, it's just, it wraps everything up. And like, so what Uncharted is the best Uncharted? It's probably Uncharted 4. I feel the gameplay is the best there. I feel the story is the most coherent and I was into it the whole time. The ending, let alone the ending, like before we even get to the epilogue and then into the epilogue is awesome.

So here, spoilers for Uncharted 4, but like, when you're reunited with Elena and you're going on out into the jungle with her and stuff, she does that thing where she cuts you off and she's like, we'll have time to talk about this later, right now we have a job to do. And it's like, and I was like, **** yeah. And then right after the next battle, Drake's like, you know what, **** that, let's talk about this.

Why did you wait **** 10 hours to have this conversation? Why weren't, 'cause like a real, you've been in a fight with your girlfriend before, I've been in a fight with my ex-girlfriends before. When you're doing it, like, you want to talk about it. It's not, you put it off this long like to get to let me go find some treasure and jump on some mountains. Some people are like that though. Sure, I'm not say aspect of it, but like, you know, but but remaining like not wanting to to fight. I, I, but I agree with you, it is a little.

They get better every time because they take from what they've learned and they do it and go on and forth. So I don't know. I mean, if you're putting a gun in my head, literally, I would say, yeah, I, I, it's still so fresh, which I hate doing, 'cause you remember it took me years to say Peace Walker was my favorite game of all time, 'cause I need, I couldn't just let it usurp Metal Gear without anything. But yeah, probably Uncharted 4 is the best in the series. I, I agree completely. I, I disagree in the sense that, uh, like, I, I think that, uh, this game is a hundred times better if you play the other three.

I think that three, maybe even more so than this one, I feel like you have to play the other ones to to have it hit you in the same way because this one just introduces Sam and it's just like from the beginning, whether we're getting new information about information, you're in there. And I feel like it organically, it gets into via him as a conduit, introduces him to Elena and him to Sully in a way that to the player could introduce them to these characters and what they mean. It's pretty clear. It's like, okay, here's the wife and here's the, um, like father figure, you know. Um, so I feel like Four does a much better job of like explaining all that stuff 'cause it gives you, it, you're right, 'cause it gives you the every man, the inserts what we talked about in the reviews, right?

And he's like, no, maybe, yeah, it's always like this when he's getting shot at. It's like, that's hilarious because I get that joke. But if I'm jumping in for the first time, I'm Sam when I play that game and you are getting all that information. Yeah, so I think that it does a really good job. And again, I've, I've commanded the game so many times on its pacing and its story. And I feel like it is much tighter and much, there's a lot less filler. And, uh, it just, it feels better. It feels like I'm continuously progressing and enjoying everything that I'm doing. Not that I didn't in the other games, it's just this one does it so, so much better. And it",

Not that I didn't in the other games, it's just this one does it so, so much better. And it, it is a kind of a pinnacle. And I think that it does all of things the other games do better. The only thing being the set pieces, because you think, you think back to the Uncharted 2s and even Uncharted 3s, like, it has these crazy moments. The more I think about it, I really enjoyed the set pieces in Four's as well. Is Nick here? I, um, I really, really, really like it. And it's funny because so many people say, oh, well, nothing could ever compare to Uncharted 2 because that was so fresh and new to us back then. For me, I didn't play two and three until Nathan Drake Collection last, when you discovered I was correct. And, uh, no, it's when I discovered you were actually wrong all those years about Uncharted 3. Um, but again, three's, three is amazing. And like, I would never say that it's not a near perfect game, but",

And like, I would never say that it's not a near perfect game, but I mean, in comparison to 2, to me, it just does not stand up. So to me, it comes down between 2 and 4. And I think that 2 still has my favorite set pieces overall, sure. Um, but man, this game really does just kind of take it up a notch. And it might not have been as fresh, especially because I had just played all of them back to back. Um, but it definitely was the, the best presentation of all of it together. And I think that really goes a long way when this game is about presentation and it is about that experience. So I think that Four, Four just gives it in such a tight package, whether it's the first game you're playing in the franchise or the last. If it's the last, I think it's not even a question, Four is number one, because if you play all of them, it is, it gives you so much fan service that feels like",

Yeah, so my votes for Four, 2, then 3, then 1. Where are you putting Golden Abyss? I didn't play it. So, so you're put at the top? Yeah, no, probably. All right, so then for my rankings then, I guess I'm saying Four, 3, Golden Abyss, 1, Fight for Fortune, the shitty mobile game. **** you. Yeah, I agree with Greg's ranking. Now, this was something that I, I had a hard time with because I agree with you, it's like, well, what do we like Uncharted for? And it's not really the gameplay. Um, the gameplay is fine, it's competent. Um, it's more than competent, but it's not like fantastic. That's not what we're talking about. God, and we got to shoot him in the head. Yeah, that's not really like what Uncharted is all about, right? Um, gameplay is",

Um, and you feel like you're powerful and you feel like, you know, you're doing what you're doing. But, um, I struggle with this because three really is my favorite Uncharted game. Um, or it was before four came out. And, and I really think three is a special game. I think three is a special game for a lot of reasons. And I agree with Naughty Dog's, um, own internal kind of, um, conundrum with this particular thing, which is that they believe fully from the leadership all the way down to the people that worked on the games that if three came out before two, people would feel the same exact way. That people, everyone would be like, three is so much better than two, you know, like, because they just got it first. So like, that's",

That people, everyone would be like, three is so much better than two, you know, like, because they just got it first. So like, that's their memory of like the jump from Drake's Fortune: Among Thieves. If the jump, jump was Drake's Fortune to Drake's Deception, then they would feel the same exact way about Drake's Deception. And I, and I absolutely agree with them 100%. They, they fully, they absolutely believe that. And that's, I still think, I even for me, getting **** about my Uncharted score, right? It's not even people calling me out that I, when I say that, I say that Uncharted 3 is better than two. It's the fact that Uncharted 3 got a 10 from IGN and Uncharted 2 got a 9.5. If Uncharted 2 would have gotten a 10 and Uncharted 3 would have gotten a 10, the fervor would be so much less. But it's that people think that they played Uncharted 2 like, this is a 10, this is a perfect, this, you. And then when it didn't get that, that was like, and",

And then when it didn't get that, that was like, and then the game they think that isn't, didn't have the wow moments because they had been wowed so much the first time. The, the jump from, as you saw because you played the Nathan Drake Collection recently, but the jump we saw in 2009 was a significant jump from Drake's Fortune to Among Thieves that was not seen in Drake's Deception graphically or presentation because the jump had already been made and that game was turned around quickly. So, um, they were all turned around actually pretty quickly. They made those games in two years. Um, and Uncharted 4 took about twice as long. So, um, when I really started to play Uncharted 4, I was disappointed in the beginning because I really feel like the pacing and the ramp up is, it's slow and I don't think the pacing is good in the beginning. Um, but it all is",

Um, but it all is overcome and I said by the teens in the chapters, uh, like the game becomes like really fantastic. The story is awesome, the settings are awesome. Um, not massively into Sam, but I think he's a great character. I think that Sully and, you know, and especially Sully, but Elena to an extent were underutilized. But I think it all kind of comes together in a convincing way. And since we do judge these games by story, by by presentation, um, by character and character development, by our the resonance of those characters and the dialogue, the little things and the production, um, that make the game go. I, I, I would have to say Four is the best Uncharted game. Um, I don't think any of them are as good as The Last of Us. Uh, I still think that The Last of Us is Naughty Dog's pinnacle.

Um, and I do disagree with you in the sense, and I've said it before, but like, I really do think you're a fool if you play Resident Evil 4 or Uncharted 4 without playing the other Uncharted games. I think that you're like, you're absolutely doing yourself a disservice. Do, and I think that you're totally **** up the experience.

I think that that like, why is he sitting there hitting papers? I don't think that for us that played the game got a better idea of that. Like, I think that that, I do you watch that, you're like, all right, cool. And then when you see the attic scene, you're like, oh, cool, he had adventures. Like, you, you get that context from it. I, yeah, I think that's the thing is, I think the, you're underselling a little bit the acting and the, uh, setup of it of like, just, just the way he stamps papers, you can tell he's not happy.

I mean, these, these really are the pinnacle of storytelling, the pinnacle of presentation, pinnacle of graphics at their respective times.

Yeah, so it's, it's, uh, it's remarkable. Uncharted 4 is a remarkable achievement. And I will give a lot of credit to the epilogue, as we were talking about before, um, really made the game for me. Um, I also think that, and this is spoilerish, so I'll let you, you know, pause whatever, I'll give you a minute to pause the game or to pause the podcast. But I do think that the epilogue leaves the series wide open. Um, and I think that was intentional. And, uh, not with Drake and not with Sully, not with Sam, but with someone else. And I, and I think that that was intentional. And I do not think you've seen the last the series and PlayStation 6. Um, and I'm serious, like, that's what I think you do. I think you take a whole generation off and then, yeah, if you really want to, PlayStation 6 launch title. And then, uh, yeah, and so I, I think that they really did it with treated",

And I thought that Neil and Bruce would have a, even though The Last of Us really, there's a lot of Last of Us inspiration, presentation and gameplay wise in this game, it's all over the place. Um, they didn't take the cue so much from the dark and dire nature of The Last of Us. And the way I thought Uncharted 4 would end did, didn't, it didn't end that way at all. And that was kind of cool. So I definitely, I was disappointed in one sense, 'cause I'm like, it's not, it's a little bit of a cop out. But at the same time, it's, it's the way you probably should, you probably should have ended it. Yeah, it's so interesting that you guys are so, so high on three. Like, I guess I'm, I'm out of the the context of playing it back in 2009, 2011 or whatever. But playing them back to back, like, I feel like three",
