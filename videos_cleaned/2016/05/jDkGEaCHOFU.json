What we have planned this year completely blows last year out of the water, and I don't even know how that's possible 'cause we were really stupid last year and this year's somehow even stupider. Day two, it's going to be full day of meet and greets. We're hanging out with all of us. A bunch of Rooster Teeth people are there, Funhaus people are there, Achievement Hunter. It's going to be a grand old time. There's going to be some games to play, there's going to be signings. It's exciting, it's a really fun time. There's going to be exclusive merch. Oh yeah, this is definitely going to be exclusive merch. Go to kindafunny.com/tickets to get your tickets today. There's a couple VIP tickets still available, so make sure if you want one of those, you act fast. What's up, guys? Welcome to the first ever Episode 68 of the Kinda Funny Gamescast.

Right, Con Live, we said I didn't want him to put him in the shirt. I was going to give it to the audience, and then Colin put him in the shirt, and now he's just been wearing the shirt all the day. So one of the people on Con Live who wins the prize box will get a shirt worn by Portillo straight off of his back. Right, you his front, his whole entire body's kind of covered by that thing. He is a sausage in a sausage casing. I enjoy it. Yeah, no, he likes clothes. I just didn't want to be a poser. This is an Adventure Time shirt.

Portillo's going to be like, 'I don't know what you're saying.' 'Do you watch Adventure Time ever? Like, have you ever seen?' I've seen it once in a pizzeria. I was at Comic-Con. That was on in a pizzeria, and I looked up. So you didn't hear it, you just saw? I think I might have heard it. They might have had it up loud enough that you could hear it.

Well, plus it's just Kevin Coello's trying to make you do something, so you immediately don't want to do it. I understand 100%.

I thought it was still great discussion, though. Like, fuck it, we're still putting it up. And then yesterday, as of this recording, a topic goes up that's NX rumors, completely not talking about all the major NX stuff that, but it's okay, we're going to talk about it now. Yeah, that's a great seg topic. More will change from here on out. Absolutely. There's no way they can change what they've said about the NX out there. Zelda Wii U 2016.

We're going to get deeper into the whole thing, but I want to hear what you have to say. You got it. The facts are, NX not going to be at E3 this year. Going to be released 2017 in the month of March. Zelda delayed, also going to be on NX, presumably a launch title. Um, Nintendo not doing well. The big, big issues, they're down 61% in profits. That's not good. They're selling their stock in the Mariners to what extent we don't know, but they are trying to figure all that out. Wii U ceasing production by March 2018.

Zelda was what you were holding on to for this year with the Wii U, and they're like, 'Whoa, no.' See, holiday season not looking good, which no, you know something Nintendo fans are used to at this point, but this 2016, it's going to go down in history as the worst Nintendo year of all time for sure. I, I mean, I don't even think that's going to be questioned. Like, that's absolutely true. Um, and then Fire Emblem and Animal Crossing for mobile announced. So there's, there's some light. And Pok\u00e9mon Go. I know this is part, Go leaked footage came out, and it looks very interesting, very cool. And Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue, and Yellow's Virtual Console sales numbers came out, and over 1.5 million, which is great for Virtual Console titles and, you know, downloadable stuff. So I think",

So I think that that's a good message to Nintendo of what the people want. Um, BabyMetal Mario Maker DLC came out. BabyMetal, of course, the classic, I think J-Pop, I want to say J-Pop, uh, band that's the little girls doing death metal. Okay. Oh, Greg, you don't know about this? I thought you don't know about BabyMetal. I thought it was Baby, you said BabyMetal Mario Maker, so I was thinking it was just Baby Mario, little Mario, and the, the Metal Mario. Yeah, no, Mario DLC. I mean, this is the, it's the greatest thing in the world. Uh, it went viral, like the, a video went viral in the States maybe two years ago, but they're a huge deal. It's like this group of like three 9 to 13-year-old girls. Okay. And they just do heavy metal shit, but in like a J-Pop format. Okay. Um, so very colorful.

It's very Ryan Clements. Um, so that's great. And then 10 million people have signed up for Miitomo. So 10 million people have used it. Yeah, yeah. Feels like that one burst pretty quick. I know that many people used it. How many people are still using it other than Mike Drucker? I get the Mike Drucker. That's my thing is there's not 10 million people still using it, but I, numbers are great, don't get me wrong. I'm not, not trying to take away from it. I'm, I am shocked by how many posts I see daily from my Twitter feed of people, people still using.

So anyways, back to the real shit, NX stuff. E3 news. What's your whole take on this? Um, for me, the entire situation has been awkward. You know what I mean? I feel like it seemed like such a no-brainer that we've been talking about it forever that here we go, E3, Nintendo's big coming out party. They're going to come out, they're going to show you the NX, explain it, and it'll be out this fall. Having it moved to March doesn't bewilder me that much, but then like how they're coming out so early, I guess, and that's me trying to put E3",

Having it moved to March doesn't bewilder me that much, but then like how they're coming out so early, I guess, and that's me trying to put E3 further back than it is really. So it's not that early, but getting out ahead of the messaging, I guess, and explaining ahead of time that no, NX won't be there. E3 is Zelda. You know what I mean? Like, E3 is going to be Zelda. That's what we're there to pitch. That's like, or sell. It's like, 'Hmm, that's a cool,' in one sense of like, I can't wait to see Zelda. Everything we've seen for the new Zelda looks awesome. But it's bewildering in the sense of, is that all your, like, that's thing. So to elaborate on that a bit, Zelda is going to be the only playable Nintendo game out of that. Is crazy. Like, in an, in, in an E3 where we are seeing it radically change leading up to it, where you're seeing Activision peel off and EA peel off and all these uh, companies make a point of saying they're not going to now have Nintendo go",

Like, you hope that was happening with the NX and the Wii U, you know, uh, lineup is the Wii U was already, you know, dwindling off, and now we have more solid numbers and timelines, and now we know where NX is. The hope was that, cool, we're going to see Wii U die this year, but at E3, going to come out, you're going to be like, 'Here's your Metroid game, here's this game, all these game, here's your true 3D Mario, all the things you thought you were going to get on Wii U at some point.' We saw the numbers, we saw the writing on the wall, took those projects and put them into the NX silo. So we are flush with NX games. It's going to be amazing.

I'm excited because it's going to be cool, and what I'm excited to know what it is and how Nintendo rebounds from the Wii U and what their messaging is. And it's very much why I'm so intrigued right now with PlayStation Neo. Right? Like, how do you come out and sell this? How do you come out and say why you need this?

This is a high-powered PC. It's very easy for you to bring your games over. Indie dev is going to work. You da da da. You know, they said all the right things to that PlayStation 4 launch event. And so you figure, I figured Nintendo had to come out and say that as well. And I still think they do at some point. But to not do it at E3, to do E3 and only show one game, to do E3, only have one game playable, and announce that it's delayed till next year. It's, it's so awkward. The entire thing is so, and have it like, and I know I talked to you a little bit about uh, yesterday when the news broke. I was just like, for me, it was out of the blue. I, I know I would have expected, we're going to tell you the launch date. We're going",

Like, 'This isn't,' Nintendo is usually so good at speaking to you, speaking to the Nintendo fan, making you, you guys so excited and enthralled with what they're doing. And this one seemed like it was very much like, 'All right, we're in the boardroom, and here's like,' I'm, I'm talking to you from the Nintendo podium of what's happening and where we are as a company.

Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's difficult for me to talk about because I am a fanboy of all of this stuff. I, I want this to succeed. I, I put a tweet out yesterday that was saying, it's just like, I, I don't understand the desire to just hate on all of this and to like, I, I know, but like, to call out all of the like, everything doing wrong.

When they release Smash Bros. or Mario 3D World or Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, Mario Kart, Mario, I'm going to be like, 'Hell yeah!' When they release something good that's not for me, Splatoon, I'm going to say that this is good, not for me.

Sometimes we've seen them come out and announce, I think, uh, the 3DS at some point was first talked about, um, at the, maybe it was the New 3DS. It was one of the, at the financial things. So it's like, no, there's no guarantees of what you're getting in. But every single time NeoGAF explodes with hype. Nintendo has something unique about it, unlike any other dev, publisher, like, console maker, anything where anytime a Nintendo announcement's coming, the internet explodes with, 'We're getting F-Zero!

This seemed like this is how it was going to be. Like, E3, when I was like, for PlayStation, I'm like, 'There's going to be 20 minutes on",

It's, you get into these things where you, we all start talking about things in such a way, like we talked about Fallout 4, but the opposite, where, where Fallout 4 panned out the exact way we said it was going to be, that they were going to do it at E3 and it would be out that year. You get in your, into your head that like, of course, we've said it, this podcast has said it, this journalist is saying, everyone is saying NX will be talked about at E3 and it'll be the big thing, da da da da. And so you get in and like, that's the right move. That's the way it should be. This is the way Nintendo should do this. And then when they come, they're like, 'That's not at all what we're doing.' You're left with, 'Well, what the fuck? Like, that does, why are you doing something that is'",

Like, that's what they do is it's like, you, everyone feels like they have the answer, and then Nintendo does something totally different. And, you know, recently that has been the wrong decision seemingly, you know, or like, pretty much for sure. Like, that they have made the wrong choices. Um, with the whole E3 thing, with all of this, I, I'm right there with you. We've talked on countless podcasts about Nintendo's going to come out at E3. The question wasn't, are they? The question was, are they going to have a, um, a Direct or press conference? Sure. We've talked about that so many times. So the fact that they're just not even going to talk about NX there, definitely a shock. Um, having said that, a couple days ago, I was",
