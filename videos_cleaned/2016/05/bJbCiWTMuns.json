What we have planned this year completely blows last year out of the water, and I don't even know how that's possible 'cause we were really stupid last year, and this year's somehow even stupider. Day two, it's going to be full day of meet and greets. We're hanging out with with all of us. A bunch of Rooster Teeth people are there, Funhaus people are there, Achievement Hunter. It's going to be a grand old time. There's going to be some games to play, there's going to be signings. It's it's exciting, it's a really fun time. There's going to be exclusive merch. Oh yeah, there's definitely going to be exclusive merch. Go to KindaFunny.com/tickets to get your tickets today. There's a couple VIP tickets still available, so make sure if you want one of those, you act fast. My topic this year, I'm single again. I don't know, I don't know how how do you do this now?

I don't know, I don't know how how do you do this now? I haven't been single in a long time. Why did you say, uh, Christine and I broke up? It's kind of a couple weeks ago, totally mutual, everything's fine, don't be mean to her, of course. Uh, but it's a boring adult breakup, like all ours are. We're living two separate lives, but here I am, 33, an 11-year-old wiener dog on my own. I I have not been out in quite some time. I don't know what life is like anymore. Well, my my first question do you is, do you feel like dating? Oh, not yet. So, I mean, you don't have to necessarily worry about this. I think you're a dynamic enough person and you meet enough people that it will probably take care of it's now you say that, of course, I see the same four guys every day.

And then, but then met Christine, and then we took a year off at one point, and I was single there, and that was the first time where I was like, holy ****, I'm single and an adult. That's awesome. I have money to do things, and I can do whatever I want, blah blah. And then you were banging out. Then I was with Christine again, and here I am, though, but I'm I'm back out. This is like my only second and a half time, right? That counts, yeah, of being single. I don't know what to expect. Tim, do I have to start using Tinder eventually? Because it seems like that happens all the time. I wasn't prepared for this topic, Greg. I would have definitely created a a step-by-step process of all of this.

The rains of the gods are about to descend upon you, Greg, and I just want you to make sure that you're letting it in. I just want to make sure that you're not pushing things away. Now what this means is you just need to not cause issue. Did you just take off your socks? Yeah, I did. You're getting real cozy for this one. Well, I was I was trying to wait for a break, a very nice break, uh, in in what you were saying to eyeball Colin and ask him if he if he knew what the rains from the gods, what would he thought they might smell like?

And I mean this, that we've talked so many times about naked pictures, right? I feel like naked pictures are a very, this topic's going an interesting way, part of of life in 2016 for modern people with modern day phones and ****. I'm sorry, Colin, one day you'll join us. Um, you I know, but it's like, in big, like that's nothing. You get some real ****, you see some real ****. So here's the thing, Snapchat, you got to get on Snapchat. I'm not getting on Snapchat.

The answer to Snapchat is yes. The answer to Instagram Direct Messages, you need to make sure that them shits is turned on. Make sure it's still private, so it's you're not notified for every single time someone messages you, but you need it open. The avenues need to be open. That's what I'm saying. It's not that you're saying yes to everything, it's that you're not saying no to everything, and that's the key. That's the key.

That's what that means. Greg, well then, so I have no shame in screenshotting. Now this whole thing happening, right? Does this help you with dating? No, but this is just proof of how easy it is. Things just happen. This is just thrown at you, okay? And it's up to you to say yes or no. It's is your choice, Greg. It is your decision. They just take the rains of the Gods descending upon you.

Not going to be a good scene. I talked about I I didn't even talk about it in the context of the breakup because obviously that's going to be way more devastating than breaking up with a girl for you. I'm sorry. So that's like that's like the that's the ultimate, maybe penultimate would be breaking up with someone you love, but the ultimate heartbreak would be that dog dying. Sure.

The real hope is that I go first. Very happy with me alive. Oh my God. Wow. He'll be happy with it. It'll be for the Egyptian gods. Let me ask you this question, Greg. If you had your choices of facing Portillo's death or having us, Kevin, and we someone else to help, uh, pull a Weekend at Bernie's, and we just fool you into believing that he's still alive for the rest of. Got like the little marionette thing bouncing his head around. I'll stup. Which would you prefer? I would I would rather him just be dead.

I mean, do we need to set up something and I'm sure Kevin can figure this out that every time the doorbell rings, we just get a sound effect going that would clear up a lot of things. See, I'm think we go the Full Monty and we just get a beach house. We have a party and people just keep passing him around, so every time Greg catches a glimpse of him, he's like in someone else's hands. He's like, got him, fine. He's enjoying. All right, so I guess that would be the best way you to usher him out if it's already happened. Yeah, back to the topic of I guess Greg's not going to die alone. Greg's going to be fine.

I think that you need to focus on, you know, yourself, and then I do agree with Tim that these things tend to happen when they're meaningful, when you don't expect them. Sure. I know. And that's the whole thing is like my mindset right now, as great as Tim's is, is not about getting laid, getting in another relationship, yada yada yada.

All we ever talk about is **** communication and all this ****. It's the same **** over and over. That real, but **** like don't listen that ****. But that's really what it's about. And really that comes, you can't really communicate with somebody unless you know who you are. And I think that's the key thing. It's it's just when you're 33, hopefully by then you know who you are.

Whereas it's like, it's not the your high school years, college years, whatever. It's like trying to figure **** out, and you're learning through your experiences to create who you are. Then it's just more about enhancing who you want to be. And I think that's the the key part that you have to look forward to eventually. Who the **** knows when? But it doesn't matter because you're doing you, and you're **** cool. So keep being cool, Greg. Yeah, I would say to to back that up, like you don't need to put that pressure on yourself right now.

Because I feel like you are you more than the rest of us are us. Like you live and breathe. Like it's it feeds in the ego thing. I don't mean it to, but you're live like yourself. You made up the ego thing. Don't act like it's real when you're trying to be nice. Well, the ego thing is real. I mean, we can all see it. Uh, we can't we can't see it, but we can certainly feel it.

And I am interested in the dynamic of Greg Miller when Greg Miller doesn't exist in this world all the time anymore. And like I think that's going to be good for you. I really do. I really just do because you do have other interests. You do have other things that you like. You do have other things that have nothing to do with nerd culture that you can that you can explore. And like what is it like when when Greg like does other things and then comes back to do these things? Will he be better? Will he be happier? Will he be will he like, you know, we often talk about how you really just don't burn out at all.
