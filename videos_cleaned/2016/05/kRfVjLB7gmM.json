You don't use that button. So Nick Nick insists on saying forward slash. Yeah, as if anyone is confused. Well, Nick is also the type of person to talk about AOL Keywords. So the internet was invented or the Worldwide Web was invented 23 years ago and we've been using slashes to type in URLs ever since. No one's confused about which slash you should use.

Yeah, how many people are coming to Kinda Funny Live? Tilde 1000. Yeah, I guess you're right. You are right. You're always right. Just like Colin. You Tilda Swinton. Swinton was named after the little tilde. No, probably not. Maybe I'd like to hope. I don't know who that is, but I hope that someone was like, you know what? It made the keyboard.

It's important to note that I've I played each of those games for a few hours. Yeah, so here's the thing. We were going to call review, but we're like, no, this is this is we didn't do enough to do a review. Just going to be what do you think? I've just been busy with those kind of. So what I was thinking about this when you brought up this topic, the interesting thing about these particular games is that they're both games that had very tortured developments. Um, and what I think H so Doom was announced all the way back in 2008. People forget about that. Doom 4 was it was called. It was announced in 2008 and they scrapped it and they made it again. And that's how we we got Doom. Um, and Homefront, I mean, Homefront 2 was so old that THQ still existed and",

Then it was kicked over uh to European studios like Crytek. Then Crytek owned it. Then Crytek went under. Start their studio went under. Then Crytek UK became Dambusters. And then the game was sold to Koch Media. And Koch Media owns Deep Silver. And then and then it became an open world game. And like, so I thought it was interesting that these games coming out the same week or really a few days apart. They didn't come out technically the same week. Doom came out first. But that they both come from this tortured lineage. And one turned out pretty well and the other didn't turn out very well. And the one that turned out well, I think is Doom. And that's not a huge surprise. And the one that didn't turn out well was Homefront. And that's not a",

So um so my my do you think that's on a personal level or an industry level? Yeah, it's a personal level, I think, because I just think the original Homefront, um Kaos Studios, Kaos Studios was a very rare New York City based studio. And they were the ones that made the original Homefront were shuttered even though the original Homefront sold like three and a half million copies. So I was like, that's kind of ****. And there's actually great exposes about what happened at Kaos, um with the game and after the game came out, um on Polygon. I think they wrote like a huge long form article about it if you guys want to look it up. It's really interesting. Um, but Homefront, the original Homefront was short, but I think good.

Yeah, I like I love shooters and and uh I love obviously these Red Dawn type games and that are kind of rare and few and far between. And um I enjoyed it. I wanted more of it, which is usually a compliment for a game. I thought it was very short. And then they had a a multiplayer that I you know, when you talk about it with people, they were quite into it. They they I enjoyed the multiplayer. One of the rare achievements I have is from the Homefront multiplayer actually.

Certainly on PlayStation 4, it doesn't run very well. Uh PC apparently is a disaster, according to Jim Sterling, who we trust very much. Did you watch that video yet? No, I haven't watched it yet. It's awesome. He has his video up and he put it up at the when the Homefront embargo lifted. And I was like scrolling through because I had started on PlayStation 4 and I don't even think I got the introduction. I was running poorly. It wasn't that it wasn't that I didn't want to play it anymore. It was that I I was trying to get through the introduction. I'm learning about where to crawl and how to do all this stuff.

I put it back in like, all right, play. It's it's like Ratchet & Clank. But Jim up a review. His his tweet was just everything you need to know about Homefront. You went that's what he called the video. And it's just like two and a half, three minutes of characters running in slow motion for no reason. Like in the game, running into walls and just continuing to run in the walls. There's this uh female character on the ground and her neck's all distended like a worm. And he walks over it and then his leg starts to distend and get off. It's like Jesus. Yeah, the game seems to be um not very well made.

And actually one of my major problems with it is that its story is just kind of nonsense. And I know that that's easy to say, but like why isn't that a complaint with the original Homefront? The original Homefront story is similar in that North Korea somehow consolidates power after the Korean War, kind of becomes more powerful than South Korea because a lot of people forget that in real history North Korea was actually more prosperous than South Korea until the 70s. So North Korea was actually doing better with the help of the Soviet Union and all that kind of stuff. When that kind of stuff started to collapse, uh North Korea obviously became the kind of **** place that it is right now. So um this the original story suggests that North Korea has consolidated power and there's like like an oil crisis and all these kinds of things. And I remember when I worked at IGN",

And I remember when I worked at IGN, as I've said in the past, I wrote this piece talking to ex-CIA agents about like how could this happen? This is ridiculous. How can this happen? And they walked me through like very specific things have to happen, but this is how this might occur that like a North Korea which just can't even feed its own people instead became this military Powerhouse that actually invades the United States. And I'm like, okay, um and I liked kind of the story. It was it was it was unorthodox but interesting. And this in this new one, the new one pretends that the Homefront never happened, which to me doesn't make any sense because the original Homefront sparks a revolution and it could have been the spark. It could have been the point at which this game began. So A, that doesn't make any sense. B, they rewrite the story so",

B, they rewrite the story so that there's a North Korean corporation called Apex that uh basically starts to dominate. They become like the Silicon North Korea. Basically becomes Silicon Valley in the 70s. They create the personal computer. They create the you know, the the microchip. They create smartphones, tablets. And so it creates this whole thing and weapons. And they and we start buying everything from them. But mysteriously in the decades that we've been buying everything from them, they've introduced back doors into all the technology and they shut everything off. And so first of all, I'm like, that's **** absurd. How can no one know that that happened? Like no one knew. It's like the Cylons getting into into the **** mainframe computers at the beginning of Battlestar Galactica. They had at least be clever about it. This",

And that's basically the foundation of the story. And there's like an economic collapse and all this kind of stuff. And I'm like, all right, so that's absurd. But isn't it just absurd in a different way? Cuz I mean, it's it's it's one of those like it's the Homefront original story line's a little absurd. Like you pointed out, like he talked to the CIA. Very specific things need to happen. Very specific things. But this is this is like this is action movie dumb. Don't get me wrong. But I think in this is stick with me because you're going to want to cut me off and yell me. I loved the the intro of setting it up. It was action movie dumb. Don't get me wrong. Of course, I",

Cuz it was here's the geopolitical forces of how this would go and where it would go. Whereas this was just a gruff voice giving you a rundown of they made they made the smartphone and then they turned everything off. Like this is just Dark Angel ****. So so my my assumption is that in the story at some point China must have been the bad guy. And if not, and I feel that way about the original Homefront 2. And there's like some I could swear that was true though. Or maybe I'm thinking Red Dawn. Yeah, Red Dawn is definitely they definitely had to change that. But um so because MGM was in trouble with their whatever. I don't know. But the the story would have made way more sense if it was just China. Then you wouldn't have",

And I don't think 90 I think 90% of the players, 99, maybe 95% of the players go and just okay, that's the story. And you're hung up like, wait, why? How could they do this and that? Like I don't know that it's that small small the number. I think that if you're going to play Homefront Revolution, especially because it's not getting great reviews, you must be invested in the lore of the what ifs of of a conquered United States.

There is a darkness and a and a dest to it to the revolution, all these kinds of things. I think that that's that's great. But everything about it is just kind of like not very good. And from like what I can tell and that's disappointing. Like the gameplay is not super satisfying. You're basically just taking over parts of maps just like you would in Ubisoft, but it's just not as fun. The stealth isn't as good. The gunplay is not as good.

And like you're walking through their gardens like in their makeshift farms and like how they like generate electricity going.

We have to remember that the same studio made these games. Um Wolfenstein was definitely over the top and silly. But Wolfenstein has important DNA because it's really the first first-person shooter.

And then they went the Quake and all these kinds of things. The game's fidelity is really fine. Now a lot of the guys that really made the original games are obviously gone. I mean, pretty all of them at id. But id's all about fidelity. And I think that you know, they kind of lost the plot with Rage for a lot of people. Like Rage was all about um and I liked Rage. But but Rage was they were like, look how good it runs and look how like all these things. And they're like, but yeah, but like it's just not fun. And I think that with Doom, it's like, well, look how good it runs. And it's Doom. It's the classic Doom that you understand and that you love, full of demons. And",
