It's this week. I don't know. Last week it said this week, so but Ready at Dawn has been quiet for some time about what they've been up to until now. As Col said many times, there's a bunch of Sony Studios that have been in the lab working on stuff that that we don't know about. For the record, of course, these guys aren't a Sony studio. Is now the time we start to see all of them reveal their hand? Will we know what everyone has been working on for PS4, PS Vita, PSVR by the end of E3 this year?

The game he's just I think he's just doing using it a little bit as a lead just to be clear though to what's happening with first party. I want to say that just because the game that they're announcing has nothing to do with PlayStation, this should be it probably be on PlayStation, but the it's a GameStop published game. The word about Ready at Dawn that I was hearing a while ago from rumors was that they were working on possibly three games um and we talked about this in the past that or three ideas were bouncing around. One of them was a game no one knew about. I think that's probably this game. Um one of them was supposed to be a VR game and one of them was supposed to be a PlayStation game now",

The the GameStop game I don't know anything about it. I think in terms of Sony studio, I think that it's possible they're working on The Order um a sequel, whatever it might be called, The Order 1887. Um we have to remember we have to remember that The Order ended in a cliffhanger. Um they have the engine. It would kind of be a shame not to go back and do something with it again because they think they have the the nugget of something really cool. I'm 100% into see more **** Wolf Man and Dracula dicks.

The game was Half Baked uh it was short it wasn't very good um but there is something there. There's definitely something there and the game's beautiful. The story is interesting. The setting's really cool a steampunk kind of England that's a little bit advanced in terms of their technology. It's 1880s but they are somewhere in the 1910s OR 190s in terms of technology and then they have **** that's like crazy like Tesla cannons and stuff like that.

Clearly they wanted to do a sequel based on the ending of the game. I'd be super intrigued to see if they do. I think it's probably 50/50 um but this game has nothing to do with that so and I don't know how much ready don't how much money they have what their funding is how big the team is what their games are. I just know that I heard at some point that there was three projects in the works um so we'll see what happens. Uh do I think that we're going to know everything the studios are all working on?
