And um, way more complicated than World War II. There would be no World War II without World War I. Obviously, they're basically the same war in a lot of ways. But um, there's a lot of geopolitical and just political and social complications throughout the war on different sides and a lot of different belligerents in the war, including us. Um, so I am interested to see how they weave that story because I guess what I'm saying is unlike a World War II game where it's like, uh, the Americans land in Normandy, they march in through France into the Netherlands, into Belgium, down in Germany and take Berlin or whatever.

Not really bad, but Resident Evil and I think people had no patience for. I think five was way more divisive. I didn't like five at all. I beat five. I beat the **** out of that game.

And actually, if you remember, remember it was it came out before The Last of Us, but when I was playing The Last of Us, I was like, oh, this kind of feels like Enslaved cuz they were far-flung future, but it was still in the same like our world reclaimed by nature, signs taken over and all different stu. Yeah, yeah, Enslaved was a cool game. Yeah, definitely, definitely an under under the radar game. I don't think I remember not loving it, which is why I didn't beat it. Um, but I do remember the environments being very pretty, very lush, very green, yep, blue skies, you know, that kind of thing. Yeah, were F Fighting Machines. Yeah, it's very, very much like a Horizon, Horizon. Yeah, we'll see if that is just a compl a long time ago. I feel like I played that game during the Extra Life tournament in 2010. Oh, wow. Is it possible that it was that long ago though? Heavenly Sword. This is a ninja this is a ninja Ninja Theory game, right? Right. Yeah, know it was. Yeah, let me maybe it was 2011. I'm trying to put it on the map. Yeah, cuz",

And then uh they're doing a Hellblade now and they did the Devil May Cry Definitive and all that. And they worked on Disney Infinity. Great. So there you go. Yeah, so 2010. That was a long time ago. I feel like I was playing it right when we moved to the office downtown. Yeah, 2010. That was definitely 2010 March. Uh, so that is this week's forgotten PlayStation game. It's Enslaved: Odyssey to the West for PlayStation 3. And it was brought to you by GameFly. Are you ready to save money and play more games? Then let me introduce you to your our sponsor, GameFly.

There's two people I've put in here, so we'll start with the normal one. This is a terrible name. Somebody went over to kindafunny.com forums and posted on the PSI board. It comes from Crack Addicted Dog. That's not the bad PSN name, that's his his bad great forums name over on the kindafunny",

Atlus's Catherine is a mere week away from release, and I've just picked up a PS3 to play it after loving the Persona games on PS2. As I boot up the system, I am met with the message, 'Do you want to create a PSN ID?' Of course, I think to myself, what could possibly go wrong? In a moment of weakness, I sign up to the PlayStation Network as none other than Sphinx_Monkey. Sphinx_Monkey. It is not until 12 months later that I realized that my mistake is irreversible, and I am stricken down to the depths of hell where I met by Shuhei Yoshida. He stares at me with his beady hellish eyes and says, 'Any last words, mortal?' I reply, 'Shuhei, you monster, let us change our names!' Love you guys, Crack Addicted Dog.\" CCT",

Yeah, that's I hope he changes changes over there long. I think now, really? Yeah, Sphinx_Monkey. No, all in C, whatever. Um, the next part of PSN's worst name of the week, which of course stems from the fact you can't change PSN names and it's a huge nightmare. Everybody everybody hates their lives because they didn't think it through like Greg did. This comes from N Ken Do 79. It's also he signs it Ken Ohio, so he's over there too. Hey, Colin, Greg, I am a father of two young children, three and four, and they are just now getting to the age where they are interested in video games, Skylanders and such. So I thought I should create PSN accounts for them so they can save games and get trophies and all that fun stuff. However, due to my current in due to the current inability to change PSN names, should I hold",

However, due to my current in due to the current inability to change PSN names, should I hold off on this until the functionality is available? Otherwise, I should I try to create safe, fairly generic names for them in hopes they'll be able to change them later, or just learn to live forever with dad's dumb PSN name choice? Thanks, Ken Ohio, Nintendo 79. Interesting question. Here's where I think the thing you're overlooking. You know your kids better than me, Ken. You already you know their names. That's a huge step for you, right? You have the chance to give them a nickname. Like if you imagine this way, just dial back, and for some reason my dad was not into cranes and he liked video games, and he gave me the moniker of GameOverGreggy right at three, and then that would be like a badge of pride that I had a cool nickname. Like I was called Bugs growing up, right? And then they just stopped calling me when",

You have a chance to nickname. Yeah, that's that's a true story. The Bugs thing. Yeah, I you know the Bugs thing. Oh, yeah, totally. I was Bugs. I don't like that grown up. Only only Grandma Miller who fought the sickly raccoon was the one who called me Gregory. Everybody else called me Bugs. And it would took when like kindergarten I remember it being a big deal that like are you're going to go there and you're going to be Greg? You need to like write Gregor. You can't write Bugs.

They used to come out of lockers and tell jokes. I thought that would be hilarious and I got in trouble for it, of course, cuz school sucks. If you're listening, kids, just drop out of school. Uh, but I I not not a good advice. You have a chance, I think, to give your kid a nickname and have it be I mean, don't do like the whole like we have like X-Pac or X or whatever over on. Don't do stupid stuff like that. Don't be like I mean, you're I'm you're already SP. Rex is driving his car and I be like Nintendo is good, right? Like that's a good one already.

But if you gave them something they can own that they can you can champion for them and make it like their thing, that'd be awesome. And think about it this way, it could live on long after you, you know what I mean? That could always be their story when they give their kid a PSN name one in 100 years. I think more simply that even though we kid around about lot, I refuse to believe that they're not going to let you change your name 100%. It's got to be coming, right? What the f***? Say that for years. It's it's ridiculous. It's it's totally **** ridiculous. We we and and it's embarrassing at this point for them. Like they need to fix the problem. It's also Kinda Funny though.

That's that got in my head weird. I write and record songs by myself in my apartment just quietly enough to avoid complaints. I plan to one day form a band and perform my music live, but right now I'm having a ton of fun recording my own ideas in my spare time. I really enjoy trying to create music with a strong sense of atmosphere, and this song \"Water\" is based on my hydrophobia. He thanks us for his support.
