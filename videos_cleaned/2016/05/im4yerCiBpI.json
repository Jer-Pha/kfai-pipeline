Go Islanders. Good to see you today. Give me a handshake. It's good to be here with you. You have such a good handshake.

Our Uncharted 4 review will post here on youtube.com/Kinda Funny Games Thursday May 5th at 1:01 AM. So first thing in the morning Thursday but like Wednesday night if you stayed up the whole time there. Now what's interesting about it many of you asked it will be spoiler free because that is what is demanded by the embargo. What? We have to because of the embargo. I forgot about that because we talked about that in Connor and Clive. How are we going to really have a substantive conversation? Are we going to do something different for like the spoilers?

I was playing the game so I looked briefly at the sheet that they gave us. I thought the entire embargo was the ninth for awhile. So I was just like oh I have time to beat the game. So I didn't play it like at all this weekend. You saw me put on the calendar. You knew it was coming up. No I didn't see you put on the calendar. I mean I just didn't see that.

Number one PlayStation 4 is still selling big between March of 2015 and April of 2016. The company sold a resounding 17.7 million consoles worldwide. This means that PlayStation 4 is officially surpassed the 40 million units sold number in just over three years on the market and keeps it at a similar pace life to date as the PlayStation 2 which ended up selling some 150 million consoles before being discontinued. Note that 17.7 million units sold in the last 1 months is higher than the previous 1 months in which 15 million PS4s were sold indicating that PlayStation 4 sales are actually accelerating.

The PlayStation division of Sony managed revenue of 14.3 billion dollars up 1 percent year over year with 819 million dollars in profit up 84 percent year over year. PS4 software both digital and at retail are also up and word was circulating that Sony generated more revenue on PlayStation Network alone than rival Nintendo generated throughout its entire business. Sony as a whole Sony as a whole did 75 billion dollars in sales for the year and net a profit of .7 billion dollars overall up 330 percent year over year. So Sony is very healthy right now. Excellent. Good for them. Good to know they can't stop this PlayStation 4 train. No they'll try though. They will. The PlayStation Neo. They will. That was an interesting thing.

But this in particular about the accelerating sales shows maybe a different picture that this is kind of unnecessary. Right. Cause the idea was like devil's advocate. The argument you can make would be the fact that if sales are starting to peter out of the PlayStation 4 they're starting to do that thing where they crest. You can bring up and bring it up again with right. But it seems like there's going up. It seems like it's fine. Why even bother fixing the table? We're not at school.

According to a stream for the game is relayed by IGN. The game storyline takes place around diminishing resources sustaining humanity coming from various outposts in the solar system and the control of those resources. The game may even support nonlinear mission progression and some sort of side quest and upgrade structure according to the same stream.

Number three, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is nearly here and Robert Cogburn, I'm Naughty Dog, has taken to the PlayStation Blog to discuss the studio's philosophy for its multiplayer component as well as plans for its future. Uncharted 4's four philosophies are fairness first and evolving experience content for everyone in a unified community. This is all important since it indicates that the game will have paid online content but none that alters the makeup of the game or whether or not it's fair for all and that future maps and modes will all be made available for free.

I just realized something devastating by just absolutely devastating. There are indeed thirteen items on the list because this was this a late edition. No it's because this was pushed up against another one like in two paragraphs or push up against one so I didn't notice. You know we've never had when there's thirteen.

I'm confused about Dark Souls ownership. Lay it on me. Because... Let's see. So FromSoftware has published the original Dark Souls in Japan indicating to me that they probably own the IP. Because I was always confused about like, well, Namco Bandai publishes these games, so why would you have any say if Dark Souls continued or not? Yeah. So it sounds like there's probably some ownership there with the, you know, like that they actually can say that. Much to Namco's chagrin, I'm sure. Number 10.

News comes from an interview with Chris Harvey. Hold on a second. There's a friend of ours. With Chris Harvey from Drinkbox Studios conducted with GI Biz, he said, quote, For a big developer, they might not necessarily be overjoyed about it because of additional work they may have to go into to support different hardware skews. But as an indie developer, it's not really that big of a deal. Our games are not exactly pushing the edge of the devices anyway. So from our perspective, there might not be, there might be some additional certification stuff to make sure it works, but it's not going to fundamentally change how we develop our games for the consoles, anyway.

Although I do think it's being taken out of context a little bit, and maybe Chris Harvey can say that, you know, can clarify this or not if you wanted to, but he's saying it's not going to fundamentally change how we develop our games for the consoles. Well, it's not, of course, going to change the way they make their games because he says they're not pushing the edge of the devices anyway. So I don't know, it doesn't seem like it's going to affect them because they're not trying to do anything like special anyway. Their games run at their frame rates and they look the way they look.

The same report that these numbers were reported in found that the average gamer is 35 years old. Fifty nine percent of gamers are men and that 5 percent of those surveyed found games to provide the best value for their money over DVDs, music and going to the movies.

But I guess this is time we're intimately back into the original question which is like there is a dearth of meaningful new IP. Sure. For the PlayStation 4. So you're going to take one of your great studios. I would say Sucker Punch is in the in the upper echelon of their developers up there with Naughty Dog and Guerrilla you know and Polyphony. I mean as far as the developers that really know what they're doing like really really know what they're doing. I'm not trying to insult anyone but you don't understand what I'm saying. Yeah. And to take them out and just be like you're not making a new IP. Like we need IP. Like really? What are the new IP?

And so to me it's like you remove them and their intellectual might and heft from this equation right? Take them off of Infamous and let them make their own game. And I'm sure that I have no doubt that if this is true and we're getting like way down the rabbit hole for something we have that is probably not true. I don't I really don't think it's true but we can dream but it would be really disappointing for for us to find out that they don't get to make their own game.

So I think it actually is more powerful for Sony to say okay let's do this. Let's get let's get the exclusive rights to Spider-Man and put out an amazing Spider-Man game.

My question is this given your experience in the video game industry do outlier reviews negatively affect the sales of smaller independent games when the review is from one of the major video game sites.

Eric Bradvig former colleague of ours at IGN who no longer is with EEDAR gave a presentation about review scores and it basically was saying that the fact that yeah Severed got reviewed and it didn't get a ten or whatever and like some people would look at that as a negative but in reality that's amplified the message of Severed people know about Severed and they're more likely to look at the PlayStation Store and be like.

I feel I heard a while back now are Kill Strain and Drawn to Death, but you still haven't heard of a release date for a long time and it feels like these two games are turning into what No Man's Sky and Rime parentheses, which we did hear about what happened to that and quote has turned into when it gets announced but doesn't get released slash hear about it for a while. What do you think? All that?
