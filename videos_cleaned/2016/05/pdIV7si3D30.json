What we have planned this year completely blows last year out of the water, and I don't even know how that's possible, 'cause we were really stupid last year, and this year's somehow even stupider. Day two, it's going to be full day of meet and greets. We're hanging out with, with all of us, a bunch of Rooster Teeth people are there, Funhaus people are there, Achievement Hunter. It's going to be a grand old time. There's going to be some games to play, there's going to be signings. It's, it's exciting. It's a really fun time. There's going to be exclusive merch. Oh yeah, there's definitely going to be exclusive merch. Go to kindafunny.com/tickets to get your tickets today.

Friend of the show, Panda, said that the problem was you'd hit a kangaroo, it would flip up, and then if its behind legs went through, they have like talons on them and they'd kick to get out and they could tear you open. Yeah, holy ****. That is horrifying. So ****. So the way that they do it is they jump back on their, um, you got to get on this, Pat.
