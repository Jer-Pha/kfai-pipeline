We're talking about it not having a campaign. Over on GameSpot, Eddie Eddie speaking during EA's Investor Day event, EA Studios' boss Patrick S\u00f6derlund talked about how Star Wars Battlefront, while generally well received, was criticized for its lack of a single player campaign. He also teased that a future installment might include a campaign. He started off by explaining it was a purposeful decision to leave out a campaign for Battlefront in part so that the team at DICE would get it out in time for the",

He started off by explaining it was a purposeful decision to leave out a campaign for Battlefront in part so that the team at DICE would get it out in time for the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The game's based on the original Star Wars trilogy, but it did have content based on Jakku, a setting from the new movie. Additionally, it makes sense that EA would want to get the game out in time for the film. While Battlefront was overall a success, shipping over 14 million copies, S\u00f6derlund said he's not pleased with the 75 score it has on Metacritic. Quote, \"The one thing that we get criticized on was the lack of a single player campaign. It was a conscious decision we made due to time and being able to launch the game side by side with the movie that came out to get the strongest possible impact. I think the team created a really good game based on the premise that we had. I'd say the game was done very well for us and reached a very different demographic than a traditional",

I'd say the game was done very well for us and reached a very different demographic than a traditional EA game. So from that perspective, it's a success. Are we happy with the 75 rating? No. Is that something we're going to cure going forward? Absolutely. So yeah, then the game had missions. It didn't have an actual right campaign. And then also he said another thing was the depth and breadth is something that's proving to be more and more important. He said in a world where uh where we want $60 up front and we expect people to stay with us over the course of a long time, the depth of what we offer is important. We have to go back and course correct that for another version if we were ever to build one. Um the future Battlefront game would need to offer more depth and and breadth. We had designed it to be much more accessible product to a wide age group, so an 8-year-old could play with his father on the couch",

So for the hardcore, it may not have the depth that they wanted in the game. So all right, what do you guys take from this? Um this is I remember when when Battlefront came out, we talked about it. And I remember I remember talking about watching Greg play the game. Um and my original thought, as they said, was this is a **** that like they built this, you know, the I guess Frostbite or whatever is this game's running on, a beautiful DICE engine. It looks it looks awesome. The the the gunplay is great. The worlds are beautifully realized. And you have to play it online. And like that, I was like, that sucks. That just sucks.

And EA can't be too disappointed. I don't think EA gives a **** about that Metacritic score. I think that that's them saying like, we can improve critically because of optics. And they've been doing a really nice job the last few years of making them not the worst company, you know, the consumer is kind of worst company in the world anymore, but Gamers first. But I think if they said like, could we bump the the 75 to an 80 and get 10 million copies sold? I think they'd be like, you know, like, **** you guys, like, we're we're good.

I was like, that was a great game. I had a lot of fun with that game. That's my reflection on it. Would I have played it longer or more if there was a single player? I don't know, maybe. But I I would have played that campaign, man. Sure. But I'm what I'm saying for me personally, I don't know if the campaign would have then cut into my multiplayer time or would I have ever even touched multiplayer? Would I have cared? Like being a multiplayer only game, I for me is not a dirty word anymore. I think it's it definitely limits my interest in a lot of games, but playing Battlefront, it nails what it needed to nail for that time.

Kevin and I were, you know, talked about in Kinda Funny Live today. Like, I'm like, have you still playing it? He's like, no, but I'd like to get back to it one day. And that's how I feel. It is one of those games where if all of a sudden they dropped, if all of a sudden in Star, same day, same Tuesday on the PlayStation 4, some awesome expansion came out for Star Wars that's just, you know, multiplayer only. And some awesome expansion came down in the came out of The Division. I would have such a better chance of playing Star Wars because I know I can just jump in and go. I'm going to jump in and be right there with every some people have better guns than me, but it won't be the end of the world.",

What's your level here? What's this? The I'm like, no. Did you do this pre-mission before? It's like, no. You don't know if that's what it is. Star Wars Battlefront, I think, was a success. I think most people look back at it and say, oh, that was a fun game if they played it. If they didn't play it, I think it is that they're hung up on the single player 'cause that's what they wanted out of it, which is totally fair and fine. But I don't think it's it's not in the Titanfall sense of this multiplayer only game where history has forgotten it. And I think of Titanfall and I'm like, yeah, I did enjoy Titanfall for that month, but man, I never played in the other stuff. And they kind of screwed up this and da da da da da.

And I can't wait for Titanfall 2. But Battlefront, it's like, I still think of Battlefront positively and I still think about jumping back into Battlefront. Yeah, I mean, I'm right there with you. I think that what you said about the the multiplayer games, it's not that you're not into them, it's just that really needs to grab you. For me, I'm totally not into it. I totally want just a single player campaign, single player Star Wars in that style. That is really all that I need. I would have never touched the multiplayer at all.

I liked that it was accessible, but I also understand that it had a a kind of a limit to its to its depth, which holds you back from really really getting into it in that way. Um I think that you're right that this he it's them acknowledging the the fault. And it's not only the campaign, but it's also the depth. And I think that this is all good signs for the sequel. Sure that they heard you, that they know this is what's coming. They've seen that. I mean, like, you know, a great example of it is P.O. Like, you know, P.O., my best friend back in Chicago doesn't own a PlayStation 4.

We can we just played the the mission, the training stuff over and over again. Like flying the, you know, the X-Wings or whatever and running through and shooting and doing all. It's like, that's all he wanted out of that experience, which is what a lot of people, I'm sure, want that experience. Yeah, so the we're supposed to be getting another one this year, right? Is that what they were saying at the E3 that they're talking about doing a announcing that there will be at least uh they'll probably be an expansion, but Battlefront 2 will be 2017.

I mean, it sucks last year because yeah, like there was so much issue and people were really uh enraged with the fact that the game was so bare for $60 purchase. And plus there was so much DLC and like day one this and that, whatever. But it's like 14 million. Like that money is going somewhere. And if that 14 million gets this this next one to be exactly what we do want, like that sucks for the people that had to invest to make that happen. But I mean, that's kind of just how this all works. But that's the weird thing, right?

And how many are the rest of the industry who didn't buy it, who like, oh, no single player, no sale. That's stupid. Da da da da da. I don't know if there's people and I'm sure of course there are. I don't know how large the percentage of people who bought that game and were like, oh, this sucks. And I mean, I saw the tweets and I know this happened.

That that and that is a totally valid point. EA, I mean, the thing is that EA is not disappointed in this game. And for context, and this is only because they announced numbers recently, like Battlefront. So I just these numbers are fresh in my mind. Battlefront sold more than Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 combined, right?

It's just those numbers are in my mind where Battlefront having been out six months against a series that is beloved by core Gamers outsold it even though people had all of these complaints about it. So it's and it's a Star Wars game and it has commercials. I'm not saying that all things are created equal. All I'm saying is that context is really important. 14 million copies is a **** a lot. And even if even if half of those people like the game a lot, they're in great shape for the the sequel. But I do think it's, you know, there's some confusion with what EA is going to do with Star Wars. That's why I think it's somewhat of a strategic error that they didn't have some sort of B tier or single A tier Star Wars game attached to the movie that",

And that's what I predicted for a long time they were going to do. And it makes you wonder if that was the intent at some point because they obviously admit that they could have done a single player campaign, but didn't to make it out come out with at the same time with The Force Awakens. So it makes you wonder like what kind of pieces were being moved behind the scenes. But with DICE's kind of mixed heritage of multiplayer and then actually they're they have a single player heritage. It's it's it's interesting to see like what they can do um with that particular uh franchise moving forward. But this fills a vacuum in between like what Respawn's going to do with Star Wars, which my assumption is going to be very Titanfall probably. Um uh not Titanfall literally, but",

And I I doubt that that Visceral's game will have an online component at all. So um they have like these voids filled with the Star Wars licenses pretty well. And I the one cool thing and one thing I credit EA for is that they're at least putting quality first. Like Battlefront was in no way, shape or form anything but a good game. It's just not um my kind of game. And I do think that it was a waste. Like having seen how beautiful that Battle of Hoth was for instance, how chaotic it was.

Yeah, the presentation of this game is is so immaculate that like I mean, even even a 9-hour experience with this, I'd be like over the top excited about just 'cause like you're right. Like we're getting these other games as well. So it's like when you look at it as a whole, man, it's good ass time to be a Star Wars game fan. So yeah, things are things are move.

Yeah, like you have like you have you have a lot of like nonsense that didn't really respect the IP. And the ones didn't respect the IP really didn't respect it or went in their own direction with their own lore like with what Obsidian did and stuff like that.

Um part of that Disney push. We were talking about the one thing that I would love is and the one thing I hope is really in the works, although it's not an EA. So this is the complication is that EA is basically publishing all the Star Wars games now. And this is not uh something that EA would be known to do because EA doesn't make role playing games typically with the ex of you know, they have their BioWare Studios making Dragon Age and Mass Effect. But not um they're kind of doing their own thing. And BioWare might be muddling around with Star Wars, whatever. But I would love to see them do another KOTOR.

I guess what I'm saying is it would be cool for them to commission a studio outside of their own RPG realm, which really is specialized in BioWare and go to Obsidian or something and be like, we are going to invest, you know, a lot of money in many years into you guys making a proper single player Star Wars role playing game. Um I think would be really cool in time for maybe the third film even. You know, really have a long kind of game and play the long game with it. I think it would be really fun.

I I I'd really be bummed if BioWare like was just pivoting away from that kind of doing their own kind of thing. So they have to start looking at maybe second party kind of type relationships to get something like that. And I think that a deep role playing game would be a good way to go. I agree completely.
