If you haven't got your tickets already, go get them at KindaFunny.com/tickets. Nick, what's your topic segway? Uh, my topic is actually Louis C.K. Uh, I heard an interview with him, exactly. Um, heard an interview with him on uh, The Business, which is a phenomenal podcast about the business, the movie business, um, regarding um, Horace and Pete, the show that he did that he basically, if you're not familiar with this, this was a big story a while back. Um, a lot of people said he was losing money on it. He decided to self-fund his own TV show and put on his website. Now, he didn't tell anyone about it. He released it on a Saturday, like a Saturday morning, purposely.",

He released it on a Saturday, like a Saturday morning, purposely so that the media media wouldn't pick it up as quickly because he just wanted to market it to the audience that he knew would like it, which was the people on his website that had purchased his comedy shows before. So he said he only had an email list of, I don't know how many thousand people that had actually purchased from him, and he said, 'These are the people, this is for. If I market it, I have to market it to a bunch of people who don't want this thing, don't like it, and I have to convince them that they should like this.' And a good portion of them, they're going to say, 'Fuck you!' Like, 'Why are you putting this in front of me? I don't want you to put this in front of me.' And then a good portion might try and hate it, and then there's a good, there's a small portion that might be as loyal.",

So I just want to get your guys' perspective on this because this, he said that now he's forecasting that into June and July he will actually start to make his money, like he will break even on it, and then he can then take it to Netflix or to Hulu or to Vimeo, wherever he wants to go, whatever the next platform is. But it's fascinating to me that a guy of his stature, because he's arguably one of the most well-known comedians in mainstream media today, um, would choose to do that while and copy us basically is what I'm trying to say. Like, it copy how we do things, right? Which is just to develop our own little audience, market to our audience, and just live in that ecosystem. Yeah, I mean, it's actually a really funny thing.

I mean, there's, there's a whole bunch, it's a really big thing now, and people are s- like, 'Oh, these people with followings, like, they don't need to fuck work hard and, you know, they're taking our jobs.' And it's like, to an extent, to an extent, it's like, I get, I get the, the sentiment, but it's like, Colin, rare form today, by the way. Sorry, Tim. That's uh, discrediting all the, the work that the, the influencers put into creating that following. Having said that, are these actors better than these actors? I don't know. Like, it's not uh, one or the other thing. Like, some of the influencers could be great actors. Like, if you have that the business acumen to kind of figure out how to do both, then",

Um, I think that the, that with this, it's, it's kind of that same thing where it's just like, that's a perfect example of, I'm, I'm putting, lumping him with actors, but mainstream, yeah, where they're like, he's being smart. He's like, 'All right, I have a following. How can I use it instead of just having a Twitter following that doesn't actually mean anything? How do I actually engage with the people that engage with my content?' Right? You know, I think it's, it's super smart. What interested me about what you're saying is, so it's about to hit, you know, making back its money so that now it can go on Netflix. So it's, no, he could have put whenever he wanted to, but his, I think his, his, he did it knowing that it wasn't going to be like a smash success, but he did it as just a test to see what it",

Um, and so from what I understand, he didn't want help making this thing. He wanted to control it all himself, which I, which I understand completely from a creative standpoint. And when you go through a studio or go through Netflix, they have, usually have a say in it. He just wanted to do, see what it was like to make something of High qual. I mean, we're talking, this has great actors in it, right? It's like Steve Buscemi, Alan Alda, Jessica Lange, like all these people that you would look and be like, 'That love Alan Alda.'

But uh, but yeah, I think it's fascinating because I think that there is that sort of feeling right now, right? To that, to your point, like I, I saw a couple of those articles too. I forget who the actress was that um, was, was talking by influencers, but she was talking in such a negative light. And when I originally heard the story about Louis C.K., and I'm actually a Louis C.K. fan, my first thought was, 'Ha, stay in your own world over there, buddy. Don't come into our world and try to market, 'cause you're going to lose money. You don't understand how this works.' But then I'm like, 'No, that's stupid,' because all he's trying, what he's really trying to do is evolve, which is all you can really, you have to do, evolve or die. Um, and, and, and so I think you're going",

Um, and, and, and so I think you're going to see more of that. And I would love, I mean, I'm sure, I don't know if he's ever going to actually share like how many, how many purchases he's gotten, but, you know, you see him experimenting. Like he was talking about how they were releasing it episode by episode, and then it, it, it went down, and then they released the entire season, and guess what? It went up. And they did it for like a discounted rate. So here's my question. I don't know, I didn't know anything about this. I hadn't heard about this. I'm just not that in tune with the entertainment industry. No one did, because he didn't tell anyone about it. But I, this happened a while ago. It was a back, yeah, yeah. So like when you're saying he emailed or set, hit everybody up, and was he saying, 'Buy this,' or is this just something that's available to you? Gave him the",

Gave him the download link, said, 'This is, this is available for purchase if you want it, my brand new show. It's available to you guys first.' And supposedly now he's getting to a point where, yeah, he's, he's broken, I mean, he, he funded it out of pocket apparently, and then spent all his money that he had allotted for it, 'cause he's got a lot of money, but he, he allotted for it and then went and got a loan. I was, I was going to say, I think he spent a, like, I think he actually like maybe broke, like, I think as far as, as far like, as far as I understand, like he definitely like burned through a lot of his own money. You wouldn't have to take out a loan if, yeah, I mean, I think he, he, he talked, but he wouldn't talk specifics uh, in the interview that I heard him with, but he was talking about how it's enough so that he worried about",

I think what he said is like, 'I would just tour and make the money million.' All right, so this is the thing. I was thinking about this because I read about this a while ago, and, and um, so I think that this is way more calculated than a lot of people are giving credit for. And I think that he's kind of, I don't want to say full of shit, because I like Louis C.K., I don't think he's full of shit, but I think this was the part of the game, which was like, 'I'm going to make a Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee-like kind of style guerrilla kind of thing.' It's not the same, it's definitely not going to have the same power that that had, but um, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to talk, and I'm going to",

It's not the same, it's definitely not going to have the same power that that had, but um, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to talk, and I'm going to release it kind of guerrilla style, and then I'm going to talk about how no one knew about it and make it cool and stuff. Like, I think this was totally calculated from the ground level. I don't think that like any of this was as random as people are making it have to be. And like, that's why I respect Louis C.K., and that's why I think that so with comedy, I think that world is way more congruent with our world than, than, than a lot of people think. Like, comedy's about grinding and um, and, and then kind of resonating with a certain audience and becoming really big. Like my favorite comedian right now is Anthony Jeselnik. Like, and that guy is fucking ridiculous, right? Like, that guy is super inappropriate. Like, when something terrible happens in the world, you go to his Twitter account and like, sure as shit,",

Like, when something terrible happens in the world, you go to his Twitter account and like, sure as shit, he's the first one to make an awful joke about a very serious thing because he didn't give a shit. And that's like what made him big. So he had his own thing. He took a lot of risks in order to do that and alienated a lot of people, but he big. And so I think that there's like some congruence with like influencers, YouTubers or whatever with comedy because it's a grind. It's very much like music. So as opposed to like getting your first shot in a movie or TV show where someone sees you and then a huge audience sees you, you actually have to go like club to club or venue to venue and like build up your thing. So I, I like, I even though Louis C.K. had his FX show and still has his FX show and all that kind, but he worked, he did exactly what you're talking about for a number of years. So I respect the shit of",

And I think when I saw this, I was like, 'This is a super calculated and actually really savvy and smart move, and you're going to make a shit ton of money on this because it pulls a little bit on your sympathy strings.' But I think people know that there's a little more to this than meets the eye. And like, it's part of the marketing campaign for this is to make it seem like it's a guerrilla thing and no one knew about it. Now the person brags that they knew about it, and then you have to go buy it and all those kind of things. So I'm sure that he made some mistakes. I'm sure he was scared that he was going to lose his money because he like built up quite probably a pretty significant fortune um, doing his show and his tour and his tours. He's expensive to see. Oh yeah. Um, but at the same time,",

Oh yeah. Um, but at the same time, like I feel like this is not as bold maybe as, as originally thought because I think he's Louis C.K. and if he wants to flex his muscles and make it happen, he's going to happen. If Comedy Central wanted that show, I'm sure he could have gotten big TV. He said he could have, he said he could have, and he just chose not to. So like, that's what I'm saying is like, he's in an interesting position where like he put it all on the line kind of, but like he can just go tour. Still risk, yeah, but he had, he definitely had a parachute. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that was my first gut reaction too. As soon as you said the thing, I'm like, 'All right, this is totally planned.' I think that's a, it's a brilliant plan. It's the same thing as Beyonc\u00e9 putting out her album out of nowhere. Well, okay, if you're Beyonc\u00e9, like, of course",

Um, even Radiohead, like when they first did the pay what you want thing, it's, it's not so much that is it brilliant or not, that at the time definitely was brilliant. That was a game changer in the way that, you know, people just content, that's what we do. Like, so much of that, I don't even think Patreon could exist if that, you know, moment didn't happen. Um, but at the same time, it's like, it's not that it was a brilliant idea, it's the fact that it was different. So it's like, instead of spending a bunch of money on marketing to get, you know, little square ads to be on IGN, like you're just putting the, it's not even so much money as much as the effort in a different way. And like, if you can make headlines for how you're marketing your thing, you're going to be way better off than",

I'm just saying, yeah. Oh yeah, I mean, I think, I think it's probably a combination of both, right? I think there is a, a current of, of people everywhere because the traditional model was always pour a ton of money behind a pilot of some sort, get it out in front of the public, market the shit out of it, spend a lot more money on marketing and hope to God that people like it enough to order more episodes of this thing, right? And now we're seeing a shift of instead of spending all that money over here, let's spend a little less money and just try to like do what the influencers quote unquote are doing, which is like garner your own audience and then market it to them. And you can't spend like, we couldn't afford to spend $100,000",

Um, and I think that's what people are struggling, that's what you're going to start to see more and more in, in the coming years with TV and film specifically as people like Rooster Teeth go, 'Well, we don't really need Warner Bros.' Even though I think they did partner with Warner Bros., but they don't, they didn't, they partnered with the studio, I think, to, to do something, I can't, out in Japan. Oh yeah, yeah, they partnered with, with WB Japan to get RWBY in Japan. There you go. Um, yeah, know our, so like, so there, so that makes sense.

What are they up to? Like 700,000 or 600,000 now? They're coming up on 800. Okay, but again, they're just, that's just a way to pre-order. Oh no, sure. It's a way to give way more than the $0 the game would cost and to make headlines too. Also true. Kickstarter, not um, Indiegogo, which I think is really interesting. They've gone back and forth between those two, right? So the movie. And it's like, but that's the whole thing is, so they're probably fighting behind the scenes. Yeah, it's about all of this, like the headlines. And I think it's great. I love this shit so much.

Like no one is, there's no such thing as being 100% in control of anything. But the five of us control our livelihood a lot better than someone who is a, a day player on a television show right now, who may or may not, whose character may or may not come back or might need to get killed off or some plot line, and they may never work again. Um, same with film actors, right? We're like, Chris Pratt's hot right now. Two year, like Ryan Reynolds was hot 10 years ago, right up until Deadpool. He was really not getting any work.

We're doing that on a micro level every day here. And so it's interesting to me that a guy like Louis C.K. would be like, 'I can work with these people and that's cool, or I could market it to the smaller audience, have way more creative, all creative control over this, control over my destiny in general, and just maybe get, I can, I can get my money back from these people. I've proven from the sales and my other stuff that it might take 13 months, but I will get, get the money back, and then I'll be in the, in uh, in the black and marketing more and making more money off this thing.'
