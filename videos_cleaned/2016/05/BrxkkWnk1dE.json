What we have planned this year completely blows last year out of the water, and I don't even know how that's possible 'cause we were really stupid last year and this year's somehow even stupider. Day two, it's going to be full day of meet and greets. We're hanging out with all of us. A bunch of Rooster Teeth people are there, Funhaus people are there, Achievement Hunter. It's going to be a grand old time. There's going to be some games to play, there's going to be signings. It's exciting, it's a really fun time. There's going to be exclusive merch. Oh yeah, there's definitely going to be exclusive merch. Go to KindaFunny.com/tickets to get your tickets today. There's a couple VIP tickets still available, so make sure if you want one of those, you act fast. Final topic of the day, as always, brought to you by the Kinda Funny Forums.

Oh, our boy supporting us over on Patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames. Steve, thank you. You are Patreon producer for this show. Seducer. You producing seducing, which is a really nice tie-in because every single question today is sex-based. This is Episode 69. I like how you gave up on the horn 'cause it was, it's hard to switch back from the sad. The giveaway stream too, the horn just wasn't, was fucked up the horn.

It's called Uncle Nick. Yeah, that's weird. That's fucking bizarre. I don't like that. All right, let's get back, back to the questions. Again, remember, ladies and gentlemen, this is Episode 69. It's been a long time coming, but here it is. Amy66 says, \"What do you think gets our beloved game characters hot and in the mood? For example, in later games, Mario and Mario 3D World, we know Princess Peach can hold her own against Bowser, so maybe the whole game is actually Mario's own sexual fantasy and he just finds the whole damsel in distress thing a turn on.\" I've thought about that before.

Let's get, let's get things straight. Well, no, but no, she was saying that like, let's get, let's get own, let's get things straight. Well, it was also a dream. Mario's fucked up 'cause he just wanted that her to be in distress. I just say that 'cause I love Wart way more than Bowser and he's criminally underused. He should, I can't believe he's not in Smash or not. It is totally ridiculous. Um, I don't know if it's totally ridic, totally ridiculous. Of all the injustices in gaming, this is the biggest. We have like 17 Fire Emblem characters. I think we could get there. We do. What do you want to do? Just walk back and forth. Just freaking, that's it.

It is a little crown on and his, that Mario never got like a proper spiritual successor. It kind of did in Super Princess Peach on the DS. I never played that, but that was a super toned down version. You're playing with her emotions. That was really weird. Don't, yeah, I was going to say, don't people feel like that game was really sexist? It was extremely sexist. What happened? So it was the kind of the gameplay style of Super Mario, picking of the tournament turn-ups and all that stuff. Um, and it's like heart-based. Um, but the, the gimmick of it was that you, to get past certain levels and shit, you need to have different emotions.

And it's like, all right, that's the problem. Don't, don't do that, kid. Um, no, I think I, I don't know, it's an interesting question. I think like, you know, Drake obviously gets off on murdering people and getting away with it. Um, that's 100% correct. He totally gets off on, I think it is. He ain't fucking anybody. That's always the thing. He could, him, him and Elena, him and Chloe, they could be on these ventures having the sex after they kill a bunch of people. They don't. The one reference we were talking about earlier, right? Chloe and him getting it on, that was in the beginning Uncharted 2.

But it's one of those where the, it wouldn't even be, you had to get up there without hurting your back. So like, there's all these weird things to do.

You really nailed 'cause it has the all the, the fucked up Nick's and it has the climbing. That was good. That was damn. There's also, there's also the constant there. So, okay, here's, here's what it is. You have to climb the wall as fast as possible in the dream, of course. But you have to do it without hurting yourself, right? Or you'll fall down and do it. But you also, there's, it's timed and it's up until you have to go to the bathroom. Like, there's a meter counting down to you having to use the restroom 'cause it's always, that's Nick's life.

It's true. It's awkward that your dad's calling you right now. Yeah, hey, Dad, just talking about 69 other dudes on the table. Should I take my shirt off? I love this is what I get to do, just sit with you guys and talk about fucking video game sex just because it's Episode 69. Oh man, Javier Bonet107 says, \"Greetings, gentlemen.

I don't think a game's ever gotten me in the mood. Okay. Um, have I been attracted to game characters? Yeah, that's kind of what they're made for, right? Like, I mean, when at times like when they're being sexualized in that way, it is to evoke a reaction. That reactions from in my pants. Well, okay, I don't think a game's ever gotten me hard. Well, I want that. No, definitely not. I think it set me on the path to being hard again. I go back to that Mass Effect thing. What? That's a bridge too far for the 69ing episode.

When you look at her, it's like, there's these big old bazookas hanging out and shit. You're like, like Donkey Kong sitting there like with his bananas and stuff. And it's like, you mean your dick? That's what it is. It's a metaphor for your dick. The '90s were a different time. They were a different time. They were extreme.

All your dumb friends coming back to see it. Speak of all this good fictional story. JohnnyEP says, \"Does the games industry need to tone down its R-rated content with women in a sexual nature?\" I think so, entirely. I think that they need to be way more decisive about what they're doing and there needs to be a bit more equality in all of this stuff.

It's like, yeah, I definitely think that, you know, we need to kind of make some steps towards that. That's the thing. I don't, when he says, \"Do you want to see it toned down?\" My answer would be no. I don't want to see people, I don't want to have lynch mobs going out there, right?

But a strong female character who, uh, female gamers or just females did connect with and did see something in and did get inspired by.

Like, women can have sex the fuck they want, you know what I mean? On the other side of that though, I think that the, the Tomb Raider thing, it wasn't so much about the gameplay, it wasn't so much about even the character. It was about every single magazine, even if it wasn't nude codes, it was cosplay of like the, the paid cosplay, the like, Sony presented cosplay of these just ridiculous women with guns in their mouths, you know what I mean?
