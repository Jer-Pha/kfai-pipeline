Um, yeah, he doesn't have a fancy microphone like Kevin, but he does throw it down when it's time. But it's super fun, uh, and it's really hard to be an adult to have adult responsibilities. Like Jason has kids and he's always getting new jobs. Like last night he texted me and said, I think I'm the general manager of the restaurant now. And I went, how did that happen? Weren't you just like a bar manager? And he said, no, I'll tell you later. And um, so his schedule constantly changes and just trying to get the show together.

It is still weekly. Is it really? 'Cause I remember when episode one went up, there was a long s like it wasn't going up that often. The pilot, just the pilot. Did you get did you get an official set? You still have the concrete wall? We had two videos that came up okay to like say this is coming. And then once we started, it was 30. We're episode 38. So it was 38 weeks ago. We've shot some doubles, which I don't like doing where you like do two episodes in the same day because by the end of it, I'm just like, I mean it, I can't I I like it to be sympathize fresh.

'Cause then at the end of it, Chris will start making faces at me and I'll go, man, I need another Red Bull. 'Cause this is like, I can't I'm not funny. I can't do another beatbox. I can't do anything. But it's better to do and it's exciting 'cause you know, he fights the traffic and we have to clear our schedules. And then we get there and even Chris two episodes ago, um, something happened where he was **** crazy angry. It was like a client or something. Something went bad. Somebody **** something up.

Okay, here's the thing though. Never anyone to we okay, so it it yes, it launched and we were excited. And honestly, you guys are so busy. Dude, I got the Patreon spiel down to a science now.

And I like and uh, and so I have to come up with like it's a limited. Thank God. 'Cause I think producer Chris was like, no, no, if people give us like 10 bucks a month, you got a beatbox.

It's not 10 bucks. Give give you whatever the hell ****. Can you hear this, Kevin? Uh, okay, so earlier I thought you might want that.

Well, first of all, it was right above the belly butt. So essentially what happens in an umbilical hernia is you get a little tear. And then a little tiny skin pops out. It's not at one point somebody's like, oh, your intestines. No, your intestine is not going to pop out of a little tear. But after a year and a half of working, it ripped to two fingers. So then I had a little bit more mushrooming. So the guy's like, we might want to fix this. And I was like, let's **** rock this. So weeks ago.

Uh, and for those of you watching, I'm touching Colin's belly. He said, yeah, it's umbilical. Okay, let me try. And then he popped it back in. And it made a little sound in my ears. And I was like, whoa, sourness in my tummy. And he's like, cool, just keep pushing it back in. And we'll figure it out. Eventually, you should lose some weight and and and and uh, and don't sneeze.
