So like over the last year, cause I feel like, you know, with politics, they've always been doing this stuff and they're usually fairly accurate. But I feel like every time we've talked about this election in the last year, uh, it's always just been that like, this is unpredictable and that all the they everything's wrong and Trump kept winning. Were they one of those people? Did they get things right? Or I don't know. I did not read. So my suspicion is that they probably got most of the primaries right, but primaries are much more unpredictable. As far as I know, in 2012, which is when they really made a name for themselves, they got every state right in the general election. Um, I think Indiana might have been the difference there or something like that, but they got 40 at least 49 states",

Primary politics, way more unpredictable. So I don't know exactly. Um, that, but they're basically just reading the tea leaves and the polling. They're not doing their own unique polling. They're just looking at everything, all the information and then make. And people should go. It's really interesting. They have very interesting aggregate of uh like all these kind of graphical ways of looking at the election. It's very interesting. And and this and it's swung completely to Clinton. And I agree. I think it's pretty clear Clinton's going to win. Um, but I'm curious what uh what you guys what what what the thoughts.

Have you guys been keeping up with this? And and and do we still feel as we did a few weeks ago that there was some differences at the table that Trump or Clinton would win? I'm curious what everyone thinks about that. I mean, after the the second debate, I think that it really furthered my thoughts on the whole situation in terms of I feel like the second debate was even more than the first where it was an absolute victory for Clinton. And if if you're not even looking at that side, it was a definite loss for Trump. Like, um, I feel like he was really he even at some point said, this feels like a three-on-one. And I feel like it was that way. It's like, I felt like even the the moderators were against him. And I don't think that that's necessarily",

And so they they would keep badging him to answer the questions. And uh unfortunately, I think that he can use that as an advantage because all he needs to say is bring it up like it's a three-on-one. And then all the people that are rooting for him are just going to be like, yeah, you know, like that that is what makes him win. But it's like really that that isn't a victory that matters. Um, it unfortunately could be a victory that does matter if there's enough of those people that that see it that way. I hope there's not, but that's where I'm at.

But it's weird though, because as as the sort of moderates get tired of it, the hardcores get more uh solidified in their beliefs about him, right? And like it just that like like I just read another news story. One of the women that came out against Trump had to leave the country because she was being harassed so badly by his followers or supporters rather. And it's like, granted, that's a whole other situation that that warrants uh its own investigation. But that's that's insane.

And that is a very very frightening thing. And I'm actually kind of very very glad that Trump's losing uh a lot of ground simply because it was funny at first, but really the man has not answered one question yet. Really, he has no stance on anything. He's racist and apparently it's up for debate, but he's a womanizer. So is he? Well, he treats women like poop apparently. But I mean, I don't know that that's that those are the accusations, right?

You get I got a Google email like a Google message calendar invite saying it's time to we're going to vote on Saturday. Oh, no. Yeah, I I have a little place. Yeah, there's a place in my neighbor. I don't I don't I'm not I like to I like to go out on the day election day. I don't want I don't want to mail it in. I want the sticker. I want to go.

We'll see if Gary Johnson wasn't so crazy. Cause Clinton's I don't trust either man. I mean, like like she's done some crazy poop there. There there's a lot of speculation out there as to whether she's had a guy killed. Like there's poop like that that you're like, poop. It's it's but it also could be poop that Trump didn't molest these women. Like, but I mean, like that, but that those aren't hand in hand.

And my example of this is like, we're talking now about something I do know incredibly well when living in Missouri, in the liberal town of Columbia, Missouri, then going out to Hallsville, going out to Mexico, Missouri, going out to Boonville, and covering for the newspaper, whether it was the Columbia Tribune, whether it was the Columbia Missourian, and living in that community for five and a half years, and knowing what it's like to go to Hallsville and have that be a town that **** revolves around the basketball team and Friday Night Football, or going to Hermantown and it's all about the wineries and all these different things, right? Like I'll never forget being in downtown Boonville where they were having a rally to try to stop the Walmart from moving in or whatever, the new Walmart they wanted to put out there or whatever. And I'm doing my job as a reporter. I'm being objective. This is taking their, this person, the rally side, getting the Walmart side, putting it all",

But the fact of how terrified these people were about this coming in and taking out the small town business. Now, granted, it's hard to give you structure. Boonville, what, uh, it's been a while. We'll say 30 minutes outside of downtown Columbia, not far. And in Columbia, there's now, I think, five Walmarts, maybe four Supercenters. I don't know. It all runs together 'cause I don't live there anymore. But at the time, Boonville, not far from a Walmart to put a Walmart down there. But the, the terror in the Main Street and they're already being closed up shops and them being there saying like, this is going to be so bad for local businesses, da, da, da. The problem is, is that it's what we always talk about. And I'm being very reductive here. Obviously, these are huge problems. But it's what",

The reason Boonville's Main Street collapses is the fact that the community starts, stops going to Main Street. They go to Wal, they go to Walmart. If, if, if everybody who's at this rally is like, I'm not going to go to Walmart because it's easier and it's cheaper and it's this. I will go to Hank's, uh, toolbox down here and get whatever the hammer I need that keep Hank in business. But when it, they, when they give up the ground and they go and they have that one moment where they're like, I'm already here and I'm buying something else, I might as well get the hammer here and not go to Hanks.

I don't have a Community Management degree or some **** like that where I can tell you how the people who are getting laid off from Carrier are able to do that. I would say don't buy Carrier products anymore. Start a revolution and a campaign and do all these different things to try to stop that. But it's when you look to somebody, one person to be the solution to that, when Trump would clearly come in and I doubt keep the coal mine open or have the power to probably through a million other things. But then on top of that, the fact of like, how as a businessman whose ties are made in China and all this other, he's clearly just **** lying.

Even what you're saying of bring those people along with us, get them. I, I think that's when people are saying he's a racist, how can you follow this guy and not be a racist? They're not trying to say they're, the racists are trying to wake somebody up to get on their side and do it. It's not the best way. Obviously, it's get closer and closer and the ads get worse and worse and the, the fervor gets worse and worse and the debates are going to get worse and worse. That gets to this really, you know, crazy tipping point. But then it is going to be the thing you're talking about is like, if there's a **** God, Donald Trump loses, right?

And I realize you should think, I should think are both are good, but they're not, you know what I mean? Like hopefully this is the wake-up call.

But I mean like, when you're, but then you're throwing that on the people, the people who are supporting him and aren't socialists, sure.

But never to the degree that I see, never, ever to the degree that I see people talk about Trump supporters. And all I'm saying is these are human beings that mean just as much you and I, you know, that have the same dreams and aspirations. At the end of the day, everyone just wants a security. They want a job. They want a family that they can take care of and support. And so all I ask out there, it's the same thing where it's like, the vitriol goes too far sometimes.

I don't see shades of fascism in many of the supporters that don't even know what that means, right? This isn't the Weimar Republic and Trump isn't Hitler.
