So like over the last year, because I feel like, you know, with politics, they've always been doing this stuff and they're usually fairly accurate. But I feel like every time we've talked about this election in the last year, uh, it's always just been that like this is unpredictable and that all the they, everything's wrong and Trump kept winning. Were they one of those people? Did they get things right? Or I don't know. I did not read. So my suspicion is that they probably got most of the primaries right. But primaries are much more unpredictable. As far as I know, in 2001, which is when they really made a name for themselves, they got every state right in the general election.

Primary politics, way more unpredictable. So I don't know exactly. Um, that. But they're basically just reading the tea leaves and the polling. They're not doing their own unique polling. They're just looking at everything, all the information and then make. And people should go. It's really interesting. They have very interesting aggregate of uh like all these kind of graphical ways of looking at the election. It's very interesting. And and this and it's swung completely to Clinton.

Have you guys been keeping up with this? And and and do we still feel as we did a few weeks ago that there were some differences at the table that Trump or Clinton would win? I'm curious what everyone thinks about that. I mean, after the the second debate, I think that it really furthered my thoughts on the whole situation in terms of I feel like the second debate was even more than the first where it was an absolute victory for Clinton. And uh if if you're not even looking at that side, it was a definite loss for Trump. Like um I feel like he was really, he even at some point said, this feels like a three-on-one.

And then all the people that are rooting for him are just going to be like, yeah, you know, like that that is what makes him win. But it's like really that that isn't a victory that matters.

But really, the man has not answered one question yet. Really, he has no stance on anything. He's racist. And apparently it's up for debate, but he's a womanizer. So is he?

But the fact of how terrified these people were about this coming in and taking out the small town business. Now granted, it's hard to give you structure. Booneville, what? Uh, it's been a while. We'll say 30 minutes outside of downtown Columbia. Not far. In Columbia, there's now I think five Walmarts, maybe four Supercenters. I don't know. It all runs together because I don't live there anymore. But at the time, Booneville, not far from a Walmart to put a Walmart down there.

I can't do another beat box. I can't do anything. But it's better to do and it's exciting because, you know, he fights the traffic and we have to clear our schedules.

And I made the decision not to based both on finances and also on like, this car can get stolen at any given moment. They break into it and just get it. I don't want to invest that much money into this because it will get stolen. Smash and crap. Um, that car eventually died. I eventually got another piece of **** car that cost me $1000.
