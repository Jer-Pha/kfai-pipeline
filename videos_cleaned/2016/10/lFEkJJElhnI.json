People on this show would know this. Tim has a Prius C. Are you familiar with how big this car is? I feel like a Prius C is like one of those electric cars. It's like a Prius that fits inside of a Prius. Small. It's not the four stands for City. It's for them making them parallel parks in the city. Two. No, it's four, four. It's four, but they're really tiny. But basically they they essentially chopped down a lot of the size, not the least of which was the trunk space is a little, a lot smaller than it.

So Tim the other day goes like this, \"I finally got it.\" And I'm like, \"What did you get?\" And he's like, \"They tried to get me to do the 12-inch, but I said no. The 12-inch subwoofer is too much. I'm going to put a 10-inch sub in the back of my car.\" And I'm like, \"You've got to talk to my brother about this.\" So I put in the 12-inch. Yeah, and it was too much. And that coming for me, that says a lot. What's too much about a 12? Was was it was the box correctly made? Like was it it rattle off hubcaps? That's the thing. That's the thing. It's like too much. It was fine. It fit this **** close to the SL. If you're in the back seat, it fit. But the 12-inch made me feel like uh, it was unsafe to drive.

Years ago, I I decided as a young Tim Gettys that audio is something I value in my life. Um, exactly. I'm like, I need nice headphones. I want nice speakers for my computer. And when I do eventually have a car, that **** needs to slap. Yeah. Oh, is that what it's called? That **** needs to slap. I've never heard that, but I'm going to use it now. Slap.

You might as well be asking, you have Prius. What I'm saying is, you're not going to see somebody roll up in a Prius and just be like, okay, you're right. You are right about dude. You're right. So I mean, I would do it, but I'm just saying, so long ago, I was just like, if I ever do have a car, I'm going to make sure the **** sound system's awesome.

So I never thought I was actually going to have a car. My family didn't have one. So just hit a point where I'm like, this isn't going to happen. My my good old neighbor Mario, um, whose brother was named Luigi, and it's like, this is, I'm gonna win. Yeah. I'm like, this is fantastic. Um, he decided to give me his old car when he bought one. So he gave me his like '94 uh, Toyota Corolla. And it was car, the most **** piece of **** of all time car. Yeah. And I was like, to go through a real hard thing in my life of like, am I going to do it? Am I going to put the sound system in this?

I don't want to invest that much money into this because it will get stolen smashing crap. Um, that car eventually died. I eventually got another piece of **** car that cost me $1,000. I went back in time and got a '98 Camry. Um, and that was even more broken at most points. Didn't have windows. I've told the story before. Alfredo broke the windows doing something in the back seat and uh, doing something or someone. So anyways, uh, that that car saw a lot of things and it still hit me. I'm like, should I do this? And I didn't do it. And that car did get stolen. So thank God I didn't do it. Eventually, we start doing this whole thing. I need to to drive to your guys's old place to do stuff. I needed a car.

Um, so I was in a position to do that. So I made sure to do it in obnoxious blue, as we've all heard. And uh, it's great. Best decision I ever made. No, that you pitted two Toyota dealerships against each other to the point I think one of them may have killed himself. I mean, that was my thing. Like I was like, if I'm going to **** invest in this ****, I'm not just going to get the blue outside. I want I want to make sure that I get the blue chairs because they were trying to give me this light gray **** on the inside. This is the only way it comes. I'm like, \"Excuse you, sir.

And uh, I've loved the car. It's been put like 100 miles on it. Uh, no, couple thousand, couple thousand, couple thousand. Everyone in a while Tim feels the, it just got to make that midnight run down to Disneyland. Yeah, you know, just got to do it. Like made fair share of trips down to the. You continue. Eventually, I'm like, you know what? The sound system of my car sucks. It's been a big issue for me from day one. I was like, like, I'm going to do it. I'm going to get the sound system.

'Cause me and Greg were driving down together. I had no partner going back. And he was dumping her. So yeah, I was leaving her there. She was fun in front of the Magic Castle. He's like, \"Now look at the phone again.\" Thanks for, I got another video for you after the proposal video. It's just like, you're we're **** done, done. So anyway, I'm like, this is the best time 'cause I'm going to have a six, at least 6-hour drive and end up being about a 10-hour drive, um, back by myself. Why so bad at driving? What's up? Why are you so bad at driving? **** traffic and ****, bro. **** traffic. 10 hours. Jesus. Yeah, man. Like there's construction going on on the the 5. This okay, so but did you get this system in?

He was like, \"Do you want the integrated thing where it's like the bass with the integrated amp or whatever?\" I'm like, \"What's it look like if I didn't do that?\" And I got the an amp and the bass and new speakers and all this stuff.

I didn't do the back seat ones. So the and did you have those rerouted as like mids or like are they actually the how are your back speakers routed through?

This car from the time you could be like, and now you have suitcase for your **** radio, right? And then you got the face off. And then eventually, and my **** one time got jacked. And then I changed it up. But um, you know, I rode with a uh, they had these things called, I think they were called thump boxes, where the actual 10s were mounted in the middle of a of a huge box where it's Plexi and ported on the other side.

So a lot of my guys had a ton of **** in the back. And it was all beautifully, you know, wood. It was all manufactured and fit. Looks like part. And then one of my fraternity brothers actually repped Alpine. So they took his brand new Mustang apart, replaced everything, sprayed the inside of the car with that sound foam.

No, he keeps throwing a, I don't know what they're talking about. My the thing that popped in my head was Demolition Man when the car turned into a cannoli. Never mind. Continue. So so so yesterday, uh, I looked over and I saw the secondary knob that they've installed in Tim's car that just controls the subwoofer.

It's like, all right, there's no bass in it for the whole **** thing. 30 second **** hit. **** hit. It's it's five of us in this car. I was lucky enough to be in the front seat. Greg was not. Greg was in the back seat unfortunately. And I look back at Greg and Greg Greg has this look that he has sometimes when he's not happy, but he's not miserable, but he would very much like whatever is happening to not happen anymore.

And I was like, I need something that my brother would have bumped in this car. I was thinking of channeling Matt Scarpino. So I put on Cypress Hill's \"I Want to Get High.\" Skun, skun, skun. And what I learned about that is I haven't heard the song in years. A, it's still **** phenomenal. B, bass drops actually hits. So you don't know what it's going to happen. Did you ****? Oh my God.
