That's kind of like us, we're like, you know what, we see all these other people making YouTube videos, we can do it too. Let's start Kinda Funny. MVMT Watches start at just $95. At a department store, you're looking at hundreds of dollars to get a watch. I remember one time me and Nick Scarpino went to uh that there Nordstroms trying to get me a watch. Yeah, let me tell you, it was cool but it was expensive. Here, MVMT Watches, they figured out that by selling online, they're able to cut out the middleman and retail markup, providing the best possible price, classic design, quality construction, and styled minimalism. We just got a bunch of them. Colin got a black and blue one, Nick got this real sleek one, and Greg Greg got a fancy red and",

Go to MVMTWatches.com/kinda, join the movement, see what they did there. I liked it. And yeah, there's a reason to them both. You, you, I mean, you really nail it when you say they complimented each other. Is that for me when I think about the N64 and PlayStation One, right?

And as I moved away from that group of friends in the later years of high school, that's when I went and you know, traded in and got a PS1. And that's when it gave me, became more of a solitary experience or just a two-player experience where it was just ponai who wanted to play. You know, I was tell story of him and I playing Metal Gear and just passing the controller back and forth back then. But then the move to PS and it was like, okay, cool, people in college are going to watch me play GTA, they're going to come in or they're going to come in and yeah, we're going to do SmackDown but we're going to do one-on-one SmackDowns.

You were enjoying the competition whether as two players or you were just enjoying somebody playing a game and seeing what it looked like, doing these different things. That was always such a weird thing. We always talk about, we just talk about at lunch, right? Of like how we make Let's Plays or we were talking about not lunch in the call we had with Jordan Smith where Jordan's like, you know, honestly, I don't watch the Kinda Funny Let's Plays. That's just not who I am. We're like, no, we don't watch Let's Plays either. That's not who we are.

Like there was people, our dorm, dorm room would be filled with people watching people play games and not wanting to play, not being like, I have next, just wanting to see what this was all about. Yeah, no, it's it was a very interesting time. I think that the N64 specifically kind of ushered in a lot of experimentation and just kind of pushed the the level with a lot of things. Like there was the Rumble Pak, the an the analog stick and the Expansion Pak and all these kind of new different ideas. Um, and as well as the four um controller ports on the system itself. But in addition to that, like I feel like when you look at the library of games, when it's not just the the highlights that we talk about, um the N64 era really did a lot for Nintendo franchises in terms of broading",

Like the spin-offs and stuff. Like we all had, there was Pok\u00e9mon in the Game Boy, but then Pok\u00e9mon Stadium and um eventually Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League, which was the Tetris Attack version on the N64. Like those things were great. But it was really what it did for Mario was kind of where the birthplace of where it's at now. Sure. Between the Mario Party games, Smash Bros., Mario Kart really kind of becoming uh more of a phenomenon instead of just another game that's out. Um, and the Mario Tennis, Mario Golf, Star Fox. I mean, and I mean, I I would look to you guys to correct me if I'm wrong, seeing as how I didn't have legs in the SNES or NES era. But I feel like this was the first step to them moving away and becoming the Nintendo they became, right? Like you're talking about as SNES was",

And what have I talked about how much I like playing with the people, how much I like tossing in a bag. All right, our next console has four ports and a a handle on it, right? And it is sequels to all these games. We making another Mario Golf, we making another Mario Kart, we making, well, they they, this is the first time they alienated third parties. Um, the cartridges were super unsavory to a lot of third parties. That's Square PE Square made uh I don't know if it was like a like what it was particular. I think it was it was just yeah, Final Fantasy VI, right? It was, wasn't it? I thought it was, was it seven characters or six characters? It was six characters but it was VII, right?

Doesn't make any sense. More expensive. They didn't have as much memory. Yeah, they were advant, they were advantages to cartridges as limited ones. I mean, the load times were great. Um, all that kind of stuff that the rent, the way the games were rendered were different. So you had more graph, yeah, and you had without a memory card, although N64 still had memory cards for some games. And that was, yeah, it was weird. I mean, the N64 that so that was, I think that I do agree with you. I think, you know, the the NES sold better than the SNES, which sold better than the N64, which sold better than the GameCube. So the the cin was already happening at that time. Um, but uh yeah, they they",

You know, because third party games were really, I mean, first party was so strong on NES and I think less so on SNES. But uh very important to those ecosystems. And N64, it was all that they had when you really think about it. There were great third party games on there, but not many. I mean, like I, you know, well, so that that's the thing is like I have this whole really long list of just games. And the thing is, a lot of them aren't amazing games, but a lot of them were at the time awesome. It's just now when you look back, it's like, oh, they were kind of trash.

It's like that type of stuff was mind-blowing. Now it's like, whatever. Yeah, it's so whatever that like you look back and it's like, oh, that game kind of sucked. But I think that is kind of the definition of the N64 besides the classics. It's looking back at the games and being like, well, at the time it was awesome, but now it's unplayable. Same with PlayStation One game. Neither of them hold up very well graphically. Yeah, most of the PS1 games that are like real good are like the more D Centric ones or like that's why I think the RPG is fair pretty well. Um, but even then you like and the pre-rendered backgrounds and stuff kind of hold up better than um some of the the other games 'cause PS1",

Um, but they both had their distinct looks. Like PS1 was very pointy and the N64 was very blurry and C, you know, like every every single game just looked like it got smudged uh with someone's thumb. But there's things like Mischief Makers or Beetle Adventure Racing, fantastic racing game. But it was like towards the end of the N64's life cycle and it's just like it was like I remember the the courses and the tracks were just so expansive and large and they like to do one lap on the track would take a couple minutes. And I I just remember being so impressed by little things like that that nowadays are like, you know, whatever. Sure, it's taken for granted. But uh I was constantly impressed with the N64 trying new things, doing different stu, playing Wave Race, which is like like a",

But the water in it was like, holy ****, that looks real, you know? And like now it's total joke. But um but there was like the Star Wars games. So many like Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire, Shadows of the Empire, Rogue Squadron, which was fant, the Rogue Squadron games are great right up through right up through GameCube. I I even because I know some people don't like uh three, but I like I thought three was great. Uh I think people got the on foot ****. I think people didn't like, yeah, there there were Star Wars games. Did I mean, there were, we had like bad Star Wars games on PS1. But um or bad particularly bad Star Wars game in teras Casi.

Um people really hate on those games and I I really liked Castlevania 64 and Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness. They were not as good as Symphony of the Night. They were not as good as the Metroidvania style games. But they were not nearly as bad as people were painting them out to be because I I don't know what people were expecting with with these particular games. Like, you know, what what did you think Castlevania in 3D was going to look like? Can you kind of speak to that? Because those games, you're right, they're just completely panned. And I don't even see those ever get brought up by anybody trying to defend them. Like you're the only person I know that like has a soft spot for him, which is interesting because you are the Castlevania guy.",

So I think that, you know, I talked about when I wrote about history of Naughty Dog, I talked about um the the the interesting thing about how three different companies, the three different first parties approached the idea of next-gen, like 3D-izing their games and and what that looks like and what that would be. They in a vacuum created three different games. They created Mario 64, they created NiGHTS, and they created Crash Bandicoot. And they one hand didn't know what the other was doing. And you got three different kinds of games. And I think, you know, NiGHTS is NiGHTS kind of fell off the face of the planet based on like what hardware it was on. NiGHTS is **** awesome. Yeah, NiGHTS is interesting, but it's its own, it's its own 3D solution, right? And then Crash",

And then Crash Bandicoot solution, I think, was probably the least novel of them, which was, and that's no, that's no knock to Crash Bandicoot, is that idea 2D and made it 3D. The same obstacle course based game is why it's awesome. It's a logical step, but it's not the, it wasn't the bold step that was necessary. That's why the N64's um with Mario 64, even though I think Mario 64 is is overrated as a game, I think is one of the most important games ever made. Um, and it goes hand in hand with that controller and that analog stick and the way they control. They had a whole vision. And so I think that when publishers and developers saw that game, they're like, well, this is how it has to work uh for us. This open or expansive environment, not a lot of **** going on in it, not a lot of textures because the N64 can't handle all",

And what you saw with Castlevania 64 and then again in Legacy with Legacy of Darkness, which was basically just a very quick sequel to the game, was um that and I and I'm like, what's so bad about it? Like I I I I remember playing it and being like, why does everyone hate this game? I I don't I don't think it's as good as Super Castlevania. I don't think it's as good as the NES Trilogy or or anything like that. But it's this is a good game. Like so when I hear people, I I really feel like people didn't even play it. Like I really feel like this is like one of these things that has just rolled down the hill over the last 0 years. Like you didn't even **** play Castlevania 64 because like, yeah, it's not it's not it's maybe the worst Castlevania game up to that point, but it doesn't mean it's bad.",

Yeah, it's not Castlevania: Bloodlines. So like, who cares? Like those, we we got those great games. This is something different. And I really, I bring up those different examples because I think Konami saw the Mario 64 example or going in that direction with the N64's controller. Like this game makes sense for the way we're doing things. Yeah, it was a little cumbersome. I haven't played it in years. I haven't played it since high school. Um, but I I was hard on games then too. And I I don't remember hating that game at all. So, um, so yeah, I don't understand that. But those are when it stand, those as third party offerings stand out to me amongst a small pool of third party games that I actually really liked on N64. Uh so what what do you think of Shadows of the Empire? Shadows of the Empire was great. So",

Shadows of the Empire was great. So I I remember um uh there was a place called Game Exchange when I live in in New Hampshire. Um and I had no money. I was spending all my money on on PS1 RPGs and stuff like that. I used to go to this place and pay $5 an hour and I would play it. Like there was like TVs set up or whatever and you'd pay them and like you pick out your cartridge or your system, whatever. And I that's that's how I experienced most of that game in the beginning. Um was uh that way because everyone was talking about it. And I was like, well, I'd rather just enjoy my PS1, you know, uh and buy games that I think I'm going to get 50 hours out of or whatever. And that's what I was doing. I was obsessed with, you know, Xenogears and well, the Xenogears was later. But you know, at that time, whatever it was, Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics",

So, um, so that was, I have very clear memories, snowfill days is in New Hampshire when I wasn't playing hockey or whatever, going to the store. Um, and that was like my earliest experience with that game. And my friend Jacob, who I played hockey with at the time, I remember him, his dad was UPS driver. I don't know, I remember all this stuff. And I remember him going to Toys R Us after practice and picking it up. And and uh I was really quite quite enamored by it. But it wasn't uh it wasn't, it's not one of those touchstones for me. Honestly, I think it's a great game. Um, I think that the the uh the Rogue Squadron games are way more important. I agree with you on that. And then shout out to Episode I Racer, which again is a perfect example to me of a lot of the N64's catalog where it's",

That's a solid seven, like maybe like 6.5, seven game where it's like the it was a fun game to play with your friends and especially at the the time it came out and being able to play with two N64 controllers and like be like, it's actual Podracer. That type of stuff was awesome. I think N64 had a lot of fun multiplayer racing games. Obviously this Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing. Um, but even in addition to that, things like the Cruis'n series, Cruis'n USA, Cruis'n World, Cruis'n Exotica. Like those are so and Rush uh San Francisco Rush. And don't forget about Road Rash 64. And there was there was Road Rash. Not a good game, but a fun game. Yeah, we played that all the time. But that's awesome though. Like there was so much of that. And like that's kind of what",

You came home with a bad game for N64, but if it was multiplayer, you were having fun horsing around with it, making fun of it with your friends, right? Like I always go back to there's something that no one ever talks about is that Superman 64 had a multiplayer game. And me and my friends would play it 'cause it was just so broken and stupid. But I it would be, you know how I laugh and I can't breathe. It would be that 'cause what in the game we created, you know, you're supposed to shoot each other. But what it would inevitably be is that one person would go and hide. And like you're in spaceships, even if you're Superman or Lois Lane, you're all in",

And you'd fly around and you're supposed to shoot each other. They control terribly. But the the arenas were so ginormous and you were so small. What one person who was it would do is drive up to a wall and just stare at the wall. And then you you'd screen cheat and look, all right, he's looking at a purple wall. And you it would take 0 minutes of going through these giant arenas, scanning giant walls, looking for it. And you'd find him and then it'd be a dog fight finally. But that Road Rash, which yeah, was not a not, it was not the Road Rash we fell in love with. But it was, I always play it as the this guy who looked like a uh Albert from WWE.

Well, I mean, a perfect example of that for me is Star Fox 64. Amazing game. One of my favorite games of all time. The multiplayer was horrible. But how many hours did I put into that ****? So many. Just constantly flipping over each other. It's just like, it's a nightmare to watch four screens all just like doing uh barrel rolls and and full flips and stuff. And I'm like, for some reason, the N64 just brought it out where it's like everything became competitive. Yeah, and and fun to to just mess around with. And",

Yoshi's Island, one of my favorite games of all time. And then they just shat this thing out, which was kind of their NiGHTS answer. Like in terms of the Crash, Mario 64, NiGHTS thing and the 2.5D. It just didn't work. Um, unfortunately, they've driven that series more and more in that direction over the years. Uh but going back to what I was saying about like Mario Tennis and Mario Golf and all the spin-offs and stuff. Paper Mario. Like uh Super Mario RPG was the real first foray into it. Um but Paper Mario, fantastic in terms of, you know, kind of really aligning what would now become the Paper Mario franchise or the what really the more Mario & Luigi franchise on the GBA.

Yeah. Uh especially for a Mario game, giving it a real story, giving it giving all the these characters and like the Toads and the Koopas and stuff. Like there was the Ninja Koopas and all that. Like it was just awesome. Um F-Zero X. Like that another arcade racing game. But like that was uh one of the few that stand out that wasn't bad. Like that was legitimately good. And multiplayer in that was super fun. And uh the frames per second on that. Like that must have been like 60. Like it was crazy fast. Um and super impressive.
