Because the more butt you have, the more length you need because it pushes it out and then it doesn't fall as far to the ground. This is something I have to think about when buying dresses because I have booty. So then because it pushes the dress out, it makes it much shorter all the way around than a girl who doesn't have as much junk in the trunk. I've never really thought about my butt much.

So you could use pumpkin in a wide variety of recipes both savory and sweet. And other types of squash are a little bit more difficult to use in a wide variety of recipes. And they're probably also more difficult to grow. And that's probably why we see pumpkin everywhere. So you get the pumpkin Oreos? Oh yeah. They're amazing. Acorn squash spice lattes.

Like that's a conversation I think for another time. I need the elevator pitch on what happened.

They're like Kanye we got a 349. He's like God damn it not today. Yeah. We were one day from retirement. So she was like supposedly she was like bound and gagged and they robbed her at gunpoint. And I mean for that to happen to anybody would be a really frightening thing. I just assume that Kim always had tons of security around all the time.

Yeah so I thought it would be an interesting topic to talk about social media. This is the world we live in. Like what's safe to post and what's not because you know we're part of that generation or on the cusp of that generation that wants to be visible all the time. I'm always on Snapchat. I'm always on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, whatever your you know preferred social media platform is. And it's whenever I go places I usually like to check in as I'm leaving the place. Because it's kind of you know in the back of your mind you're always like well I don't know who's watching my stuff. I don't know who's in the neighborhood.

It's like they're like oh your friend over here is like you know nearby. And I don't have any of that proximity stuff turned on. And so I thought it would be an interesting idea to talk about like what do you guys think as people who you know are in the public eye and who do post a lot on social media and have you know this really large fan base. You know like what do you guys think about what's acceptable to post on social media in terms of personal security and what's not. Like do you guys draw the line somewhere. Do you have a set of standards. Do you just kind of like wing it every time. I mean I think posting anything is just like it's a bad idea. So",

You know like that's not it's not good but that's just life. That's how things are going to be. I remember a long time ago my mom told me all these stories of people around Christmas everyone gets robbed because people go on these group trips and like people are looking at people's houses. That was the plot of Home Alone. Well there you go. But like my mom's growing up the entire block besides my mom's house got robbed because she was the only like family that stayed home but like everyone got their shit jacked.

Those would constantly get jacked because people would just be like oh we know that the kids are in class. You can easily kind of figure out someone's schedule if you're watching them. So it's like add social media to that and it's just making things even easier for you to know where you are and where you aren't at specific times if you wanted to do some shit. Like for Kim K's situation that's a little extreme because I mean I feel like regardless of her doing social media stuff they were trying to find her.

You're ever 100 percent safe but you know like we have an office and so like we revealed where that is like you know where our office is or whatever and it's not that hard to find. But there's a great security system and Kevin is for some reason always Kevin will knock you out and anything Kevin fucking lives here. I have no idea when he sees his fiance but he's always here.

So every night when I get into bed I pick up the book on my bedside table and I read for at least 10 minutes. Sometimes if I'm in a really good section or if I'm not super sleepy I'll read for an hour or more. But I read every night and I always have it there. So it's always convenient.

So I guess we can all kind of decide that we think that it's not acceptable. Sure. But I kind of thought this was a nice jump off point for just public bathroom etiquette.

If you're at a table with friends obviously leave it. Obviously. If you're with trusted people they'll watch it for you. But yeah no like with the stuff flying in the air no you have to cover it. Either with toilet paper or with a paper towel whatever it's clean and close. See this is I mean my entire IGN career and argument that existed on Game Scoop of whether or not at a bar you're a guy you could take it in and go to the urinal and pee and not have to worry about it.

I think we're losing the sight of the main argument. I agree. You should be able to bring a drink in and then hold it as you're peeing or put it on top of the urinal.

This is what cracks me up when we go to events is that I pride myself on leaving events not getting sick because I got sick at one Comic-Con and that was like the game changer where I'm gonna sterilize my hands before I eat anything. If I leave the house as soon as I leave the hands don't touch food and then go in. So I'll go and wash my hands but I'll go and wash my hands sit down at the restaurant and then bring out my phone which I was just touching with the filthy hands. Yeah exactly.

Because I'm like you have to like almost build up these antibodies and get like I understand like I wash my hands before I eat or after you take a shit you should wash your hands whatever. And whenever you use a public bathroom pee or poop you gotta wash your hands. I mean those are general rules. And by the way speaking of etiquette I always notice when a person comes out of the fucking bathroom and doesn't wash your hands. Always 100% of the time. It's the worst. Yeah you're like dude.

So no but like also don't overthink it. It's not to that point. Yeah no for sure. But I mean there's other bathroom etiquette that I think we should discuss. Exactly I agree. Now I'm interested from the female perspective. Where do you come down on? You walk into a stall you shut the door and the stall next to you is on the phone. That's fine I don't care. I can't do that in a men's room. I'm like dude what are you thinking? I mean like I think it's rude to the person they're talking to but I mean that's on them.

The thing the number one thing that I absolutely can't stand about bathroom etiquette is when people don't fucking flush the toilet. It is the worst. How do you get up and go to leave the stall and not flush the toilet? Yeah no I mean I'm right there with you. My only thing is there's a point of no return. What does that mean? Where if that toilet is just fucked by the time you got there and there's been 30 people that have been through that. Then why are you using it then? Because it's the only place that I need to pee and it's just like things are happening. They're making a chocolate crepe pie.

If it's got the little black button you got no choice. That's why they put the little black button. I'm gonna take this a step further to your point. I had an experience once that was very informative. It was at Hops and Hominy. Now Hops and Hominy has these like four different bathrooms and then like a kind of a trough sink or whatever. It's not a trough actually it's like four sinks next to each other. It could be a trough. So not quite like NOPA but you know something like that. And they I went to flush and they kind of halfway flushed. This was like a few years ago. And then I walked out and one was walking in and I was like wait a minute. And like had",

So now like I'm like no that would have been fucked up even if someone walked in five minutes later to find out that I was being lazy or whatever about it. So I've gotten to the point in the last few years where even if I find the toilet not in like a fucking gas station you know like where there's a little bit of pee sprinkle on it or whatever. And then I'm like it's not mine. I like do wipe it off because I'm like the person especially if it's a woman that walks in next is gonna think I did that.

So that was a very kind of an educational experience. I hate being the bigger man. Like we went to Dos Charros recently and I went in there just to wash my hands. And then I was like well I'm here I'll pee too. And I peed and then like the flusher's just broken. I'm like fuck I didn't break this guy. And then I wash my hands. I gotta go out there act like I broke it. I'm like hey your toilet doesn't work. She's like oh I know. I'm like bye. Bye. Bye. You guys great. My head down swift run out you're done.

No if it's my move like that's the thing where I've done it where I you know you shoot for the basket. Or I do the thing where it's like you grab the door handle with the paper towel and throw it open cause you just want to go eat. And then you go to throw it and the door starts closing. You see it at the ground like fuck go over there. I get another paper towel pick that one up. Cause now it's touched the ground. Now it's touched the floor. I don't want any part of it. Yeah no I'm with my whole mantra in life generally. And this is using a kitchen using a bathroom whatever. It's like I leave it the exact way I found it. And probably like so someone else can use it.

Because that's the way you know this reminds me the whole and this is kind of an aside but it really isn't where like it doesn't take that much initiative to just do the right thing.

All these people are waiting behind you. It doesn't take that much effort to just do the right thing. And then the people behind you maybe do the right thing.
