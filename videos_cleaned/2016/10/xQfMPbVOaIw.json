So we're like, we should do a separate topic just for that. And then they announced the the NX drop, the Nintendo Switch that we now know about. So we did a reacts about that that you should check out over here on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames. We're very excited about. Let's take a second just to talk about that, just to, you know, whet the appetite of the the Gamescast audience. Hell, yeah, Greg gave it to us. You did. Yeah, did I win, Colin? I mean, name's terrible, but I think that the everything else about it's super promising. Pre-ordered as soon as possible. I mean, I think it looks really exciting.

And I think it's gonna be a success. I think the name will grow on us. And I was saying that thing, like, if they put multi-platform games on there and they don't run poorly and they don't look like shit, it'll be interesting to see where I play. You know, I'm most excited because the the idea of the 3DS and Wii U libraries both being in one console, a console that doesn't look like a toy, third-party support, and the ability to use a Pro Controller with awesome, huge buttons. I'm just like, thank you. Every that trailer gave me everything I needed.

Yeah, but you like one of them cool losers. That's the thing. Yeah, anyways. All right, so Red Dead Redemption 2 is the topic of the day. We got the trailer. Uh-huh.

He says, for the past 20 years, Rockstar have continually redefined the concept of open worlds for the record-breaking Grand Theft Auto series, The Midnight Club racing games, the schoolyard comedy Bully, to the breakout hit Red Dead Redemption. Rockstar's consistently delivered on a level that few have managed to match. Now, following it was Grand Theft Auto V, one of the most successful entertainment properties of all time. Rockstar set to return with Red Dead Redemption 2, the latest entry in the Red Dead series of games. And there's no better place to play it than PlayStation.

We're pleased to announce that PlayStation 4 players get first access to earn select online content in the vast open world of Red Dead Redemption 2. Check back on PlayStation Blog for more details soon and for all the latest on Red Dead 2. In addition, the PS3 classic Red Dead Redemption will be coming to PlayStation Now soon. Relive the epic story, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, talk about PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 4 version. Um, this streaming garbage. So that's a big coup for Sony.

We've heard rumors, Frost. But but the again, like, I don't know if that's true and I don't have any like, I I've heard it from from, you know, you know, I especially, you know, people that you if you heard something from that person, you'd be like, okay. But it doesn't it kind of say something that this trailer isn't the trailer that they talked about? Exactly. I was gonna say that what we heard about that trailer was something like it was like a shoot up, a shootout in a solo of saloon or something like that, right? That's what that's why I heard. I think, well, have you heard that? I don't know if that's true. I don't know what the fuck that game. So I'm not, you know, say that's what it was. I don't know, but I.",

Could be a different trailer. Maybe we see those shootings. Exactly. So regardless of that, I often see these third-party partnerships on multi-platform games with Battlefield or with Call of Duty. And I'm like, there's probably some marginal with Destiny, whatever. That's probably marginal marketing value there. And it certainly probably gets more people to play the game on that console. And so they wouldn't do these things that they didn't make money. They they're the bean counters and they understand that.

And if that's a similar kind of thing here with the multiplayer stuff, which is more what they're going for now with Grand Theft Auto Online, with GTA V and stuff, and that's a really big win for them because that the game's not gonna be on PC for a while. It'll obviously come to PC later, but it's not gonna PC for a while. So PS4 is gonna be the only place to play the dominant portion of the game, it seems like, initially, that people are still playing on the sister game, Grand Theft Auto V, if that makes any sense. Yeah, me, I feel like that's pretty pretty big thing for Sony. I agree. But I I mean, I think it could easily not be. Is it just going to be hats? Is it gonna be that this mission pack? Is it.",

Is it gonna be that this mission pack? Is it like the Call of Duty shit where this mission pack drops a month early? And the reason like the early GTA V Online updates share those first started, they weren't really a consequence. It wasn't until a couple months in that we started getting the real sizable things like the Cunning Stunts Pack. Instance. Yeah, there's just such an amazing name. Yeah. So I think that this is really big. The trailer itself, I mean, we talked about, you know, I think you thought it was gonna go a little longer. I thought it was gonna go a little shorter. I think it was more towards the shorter end. No, I don't think they I kind of there's a few things I feel about this. What's fucking awesome the gate? I mean, the game looks pretty.

They emphasize those seven characters at the end of the the trailer again. So we're interested to see. I'm sure we'll meet them over time in the marketing. But it also brings up why they announced it now. No reason to announce this early. I think it's totally stupid to announce it this early, especially in light, not that they one hand or the other hand was doing with this, but like with the Switch announcement, all these kinds of things.

And I think that they just had to go forward with it with the logistics of their investor meeting, all these guys today. Oh, I'm sure they won. And I'm sure that sucks for Rockstar. And because it really brings you back to the fact that like, it's like, you really could have announced this in literally six months or more. E3. I don't unless they were afraid of a leak or something like that. I don't quite understand why it was announced now. What what that said, we know it's coming.

On the other hand, don't understand why it was announced so early. Trailer was a little short, which I expected. And we have a lot of questions. Yeah, I was gonna say for the question part, Colin, you and I haven't talked about it since PS I Love You XOXO, which was before we even had the name and the release date in there. I talked about what do you think the story is that of that? And I mentioned, you know, do you think it's a prequel? A lot of people think this kind of looks like Dutch, whatever. And you're like, I don't think it will be. I don't know. Have you seen the most recent screen caps and comparisons? Because there's one where they put they took a cutout of the logo.

And they put their Red Dead counterparts above them. And how Marston looks like Marston and Dutch looks like Dutch. And then the other guy, unless I'm confusing him, it has the exact same thing where as hat like pinned up to the side of his head and stuff. It looks interesting that maybe this is going to be Red Dead 2 is going to be the prequel to Red Dead 1 and tell you the story of this game. Obviously, we don't know. All we're left is to speculate. But I thought it was interesting. Yes, it's possible. Do we do we remember the date in which Red Dead Redemption took place? It was around the Mexican War, wasn't it? 18 was it 1840s or was it later?

I mean, it's not like trains didn't exist, but it seems to like the whole vibe of it seems to suggest Reconstruction or after. And I don't know. So we're talking like 1865 to 1877 somewhere in there. But I don't I'm looking into it. Yeah, so when we have it, I don't but I don't know. I mean, what the fuck knows? I Rockstar, I'm sure has all that shit nailed down in terms of a steady aim set during the decline of the American frontier in the year 1911, follows John Marston.

Why where that can actually take away? I think it's been a while. So yeah, definitely. I think that that certainly I suggest you take six primarily in the year 1911, during the final decade of the American frontier. And the cowboy and outlaw archetypes that shaped it. The landscape of the Wild West is beginning to fade. And modern technologies like automobiles, machine guns, and oil drilling projects are beginning to away. That's right. That's right. That's right.

Yeah, by expansion, all those kind of things. So based on the imagery in the in the trailer, you're right. It seems like it with with the screen caps that I haven't seen. I remember anything about the fucking story in Red Dead Redemption at all, to be honest, clearly. But uh, based on the imagery of the train, all this kinda stuff seems like it moves back to maybe the late 19th century then. You think so? Us. But if it's sound, this will uh, that's pretty cool. 1911. Jeez Louise. At least I want to go back and play it again even more now. This is not the one I'm talking about, but it's similar, right?

Well, it seems like it seems like it's not grasping at straws, maybe. I mean, it seems like the Red Dead Redemption 2 name is very very intentional. Obviously, it's the third Red Dead game. So we all assumed that it was gonna be Red Dead and whatever Redemption. So all of this fat sandwich. I think Redemption. Yeah. So I think that that all makes a lot of sense going together.

So that's that was a much better one. That's gone. Greg, I'll send you these image. I think I mean, I think that's pretty obvious at that point. Yeah, good job, internet sleuths. Yeah, yeah. So about the them announcing it so early, like it is weird because they can kind of do whatever they want. But I think that the reasoning for it is I mean, they totally and they could have done this later as well. But there's the power of things not leaking.

Like they're they're social following went up immensely. We don't look to the beginning the week till now. So it's like they definitely they gained a lot from it, right?

And it really sucks for Red Dead. Yeah, I mean, I would have assumed Nintendo would have just based on like hardware. Yeah, it's more exciting. But I think it would have been way easy for me. It would have been way easier for a Nintendo to fuck it up.

Yeah, I don't I people are gonna get on me again about this.

Even they're showing you the in-engine footage of the game. So I I give them credit for that. It's not really fucking what you're seeing. It that's the thing is I would much rather expansive in a world that lives and breathes than things being like extremely realistic and pretty. But my things specifically, lying, and I, 'cause the people I know are gonna destroy me the comments for saying that. But like, I'm specifically talk about the scene where it's the dog versus the roosters or whatever the fuck. Like that dog animation does not look good. Mm. Like it immediately that like it stood out to me. I'm like, oh, and like that shouldn't be happening. Like especially for a trailer. It's like when you're.",

Like especially for a trailer. It's like when you're watching a trailer, it should be the the perfect things that you're trying to show some. Yeah, which could signal bad things for the game's aesthetic. But I doubt it. I feel like, yeah, like when you saw the guy walking through the field, I was like, yeah, it everything it doesn't everything's not quite right. But it's not Fallout where it's like, wow. Yeah, but I feel like when you you wrap just a minute-long trailer that sure purpose is looking pretty nitpicky is all you have. Yeah, I agree. I was actually shocked that we're gonna see anything an engine at all. So I thought for sure it'd be a cinematic of some sort. And I was expecting to see this so-called the rumored saloon thing, like really violent trailer, which I think would've been great. Maybe we'll see that in the future. Maybe we'll never see it.

Hangar 13 so yeah I think that similar than Nintendo's which there's some things you might be concerned about but there's no reason right now not to be excited about it either yeah well there be reasons to not be excited about it later maybe but we'll have to wait and see I am stoked it looks fantastic can't wait to play on my Switch",
