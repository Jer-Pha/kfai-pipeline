So the final topic of the day, I asked the audience for a bunch of questions for you, Peer, and we got him. Okay, you two can go to KindaFunny.com/GamescastTopic, just like all these people did. Ask some questions, we'll answer them on a future episode of the Kinda Funny Gamescast. And as always, thank you to Steven Inslee, the Patreon producer of the week. Talked to at our Patreon Q&A. He is, he's legitimately alive. He emailed in a private thread. Thank you, Steven Inslee, for confirming you are not dead.

Did he do it one month and his credit card is just getting nailed? Maybe. Sure, he's been the producer of the Gamescast for about a year at this point. I'm doing an awesome job, man. Yeah, know you're alive and well. Alright, so this question comes from Alex. Okay, he says, this is my question to Peer. It's a, it's a pretty long one. 20 years is a long time. I'm a good seven, almost eight years older than that, but still, that's a hefty chunk of time. I myself have spent most of these 27 years engrossing gaming, spending most of my time flipping through EGM, Game Informer, and other publications.

Ever since the early 2000s, though, I've been spending my time on the internet getting my information from there. You've seen the change happen, the slow shift from physical to digital. Sorry for the intro, I tend to be long-winded. My question is threefold: With the hindsight of the past and the experience you've gained, where do you think you've made mistakes and where would you have done sooner? Oh, okay, so professionally, right? Not mistakes in real life. We've, we've made plenty of mistakes. We look at these guys, we let them go. We should have just locked the door and chained them down, and they would have happened not to a YouTube channel. Stop. Yeah, exactly. No, I, you know that I think there have been some mistakes where we didn't realize early enough what personalities really meant to IGN, and like we could have tried harder, and like they were always kind of like, they were financial realities that keep you",

Like I would have loved to keep Casamassina around, for example, but that was at a time where we just could not for a team to like a big team and grow it and all that. So definitely people, I have lots of regrets with, with, with not having some other people around when the dot-com market crashed. So this is early, this is like in the early 2000s, right? 2000 to 2001, advertisers no longer bought ads online. We took a portion of the site and moved it behind subscription and included in that were the message boards. And so overnight, basically, we created a subscriber base of a hundred thousand people who would pay us like 30 bucks a year, which was good. And honestly, that helped us weather a draw like to investors, future investors who would come in to and purchase IGN. It was, hey, the",

It was, hey, the audience does care about IGN, and they, they would even pay for the content, which nobody did online back then. So it was a necessary step, but I think we killed a really important part of our audience at that point, like the, the community, right? Like you see the rise of Reddit and like the decline of the IGN forums, and those days, like they're very intertwined. And Colin, probably 4chan, too, like some of these forums that popped up. And so, you know, we were, we didn't know what we're doing. We're taking content, people putting it behind a paywall, and I think we created this narrative for a couple of years that in order to get the best stuff on IGN, you got to pay. And there's an audience that was not willing to pay. And so we learned from that, right? Like now in this day where gaming sites are notorious for high",

Like now in this day where gaming sites are notorious for high ad-block rates, right? And you can go, you can do the sledgehammer approach. You could go out and you say like, you know what, if you, if you ad-block, you can no longer watch videos. Like you can make that technically happen. We wouldn't do that. We wouldn't do that now because we know that that audience that is unable to pay or that is unwilling or doesn't, doesn't think about unblocking your site, we know that that audience can be tremendously valuable today, tomorrow, in the future, right? These are the guys that share your content or support you'll buy your T-shirts or come to your shows. And so those are some of the regrets and the learnings that have come from it.

You can never prove it. We did, we did. So at one point, we changed our rating scale from, I think it was five Mario hats to like five stars, and then we went to a ten point scale or something, then we went to a hundred point scale. And like, I think I tweaked the numbers on some games, and nobody will ever know. That's awesome. I love that. On the second question from him is, what would you say are your proudest moments from IGN? Proudest moments from IGN. E3 in 1997, when we went in there and we covered E3 like nobody else, like around the clock updates, and like our site went nuts with activity. Like we shot up from nothing to being a big site overnight. And all the other guys were going like, hold on, but I thought we're gonna write when we go back, right? Like",

And all the other guys were going like, hold on, but I thought we're gonna write when we go back, right? Like because it was the magazine business. They went to E3 for three days, then they went back to write. And like we did it all while at the show. So that was, I was tremendously proud of just kind of like the volume and the experience and like the feedback. Beyond 300. Beyond 300 was freaking amazing. Like what you guys did that, that show. Like, you know, like I teared up multiple times during that. Um, that was really awesome to just kind of see the power of an audience that we talked about. Commenters, right? Commenters on IGN are 0.8% of the audience oftentimes. So less than a percent of the people who read a review actually comment on it. Small part of the audience. But when you take a fervent audience like that, you put them in a room, holy crap. I mean, that like outpouring of love and the reaction like I got",

I mean, that like outpouring of love and the reaction like I got it. That's at the top of my list for sure. That's awesome. And then the third question from him is, where do you see games media going? Do you think it'll split? Will we go down the more Entertainment Tonight route or long-form journalism route? Will there be a middle ground? I think there's a middle ground. I mean, like the definitely game journalism is going multi-platform, and that's what we're working on so hard, right? Like making sure that it's no longer like when you're on Facebook saying like, go to IGN to read the review. No, you are on Facebook, here's the review. That's what we want to do. And I think games media is gonna go there. I don't think everybody has a big team like us and can make that happen as efficiently. But it's, it's a no-brainer. It'll like when you're wearing your, your, you know, PS VR",

It'll like when you're wearing your, your, you know, PS VR headset, the content should be in there. You shouldn't have to take it off, go to the website and look for it. And so long-form is a real issue, guys. I mean, you, you know this, right? Like you've written some of our best long-form editorial content. It's hard to finance that now when your principal, your principal monetizing factor are ads, because a really shitty piece that's written in ten minutes can get make the same amount of money as a very long, awesomely researched piece. And so we got to figure out how do you, how do you fund that? Maybe, you know, like the Patreon route is a good, like, you know, Danny O'Dwyer is doing like taking that route that will keep long-form journalism alive. It's more difficult for us to do that kind of stuff. Mm-hmm. But I'd love to solve that to going off of something you",

But I'd love to solve that to going off of something you were saying in there. A question from Chance Carter: Are there any plans for IGN VR content in the future? Yeah, so we have, we actually have a YouTube channel. You just setting this up with our YouTube channels called IGN VR, and we host kind of trailers and, and kind of experiences that are done in, in 360 video. I don't think you can use the PS VR for it. Yeah, no, not yet. But we do have an app on the PlayStation for IGN content, free app. You can just watch our videos. And we would love to create a VR area in there way you can play the 360 content. And Sony has the, you know, you can do this now with the kids. It's just development time that we have to spend. We've done some experiments. We bring 360 cameras through E3 and events like that now.

So yeah, we, if people buy these headsets, and by all estimates, I think analysts are saying there'll be 2 million plus tethered devices by the end of the year, you know, like the two million level. And then all that kind of like Samsung VR and Google is doing stuff, you know, it might be worth doing more. And what's cool about it too, I saw you guys did that Mario thing. Well, I guess VR Mario. And even without a VR headset, you just go on YouTube and look at it and kind of click and drag around the mouse or use your phone and do the whole fake VR or whatever it's called. Yeah, and it's super cool. It's like, it's the history of Mario but through, through VR. So it's like you see Mario and you can go down into the underground and do this whole thing. Yeah, very cool.

But you can't just put a, you know, three, the 360 camera here. You'll see like, you know, yeah, I've been sleeping, so-and-so's over there. And like that's a big problem once that VR content creators have been facing where it's just like you, you need to build all content around that entire idea from now, around that. Or else it's the same problem we're seeing with video games. Oh, it's like you can't just take video game experiences and put in VR. You need to make experiences for. And that's why we, I mean, we're far away. We've done like Square, we've done a Square office tour when we went to Japan. We went to Square. And so you have a 360 office tour. We went to some strange Japanese cafes. I don't think we did the owl one. But like, you know, do 360 content like that. And it's really neat. Apollyon says, congrats again on the anniversary.

And I think I told you this, my wife works, so she was half Japanese. She works for a Japanese company. And when I first went to like a company barbecue, like a guy came out with like, ah, like he just pointed at me. And I'm like, what did I do? He's like, huh? Like he did the pose from the Reaction Guys thing. Like, and like it just dawned on me like how far this thing has gone, because he's not like a gamer. Like he doesn't know about IGN. But he's seen this in Japan before. Yeah, yeah. I mean, we just took two pictures, right? Like one at E3 when Nintendo was showing Pac-Man, remember Pac-Man Vs.?

And then a year later, we had gotten tipped off that Nintendo was gonna show Twilight Princess. And we may have seen the trailer before it was shown. And so we took another picture where we staged fake excitement. I mean, we were excited, but we faking it. And then people put those two together on message boards, and they became big in Japan to the point where like their anime, it's in a couple of anime, it's in manga. It's somebody sent me a picture from Akihabara games shop, a store with like super sale in a sec.

They're like, can we interview you guys? Like, I think you were actually, I stood in for the one guy. No, no, I thought Craig was. I don't know what a Che Chambers. Nobody noticed camera. And like one of the questions was, this is amazing. What are you going to do next? We're like, we didn't plan this. That's fantastic.

Like that was the thing that really surprised me once I started doing things on camera. Like, you know, we've talked about in the past like the, the idea, like the, the fundamental idea of doing a conversational video at IGN was actually my idea. And, and, and that was, that was we came up with PlayStation Conversation, a daily video where we she's like recognized sitting on a desk talking about something that happened that day.

If we ask to do the second or third or four takes, it totally goes off the rails. We can't do it. Like there are certain things. And that's what it started developed me as like, I guess there's more and more quote-unquote personality. And I'm just guys, so I haven't let go, but I've also embraced it. I think that it's part of what it is today. But my writing, what, what gets me so happy is that a lot of proliferating my quote-unquote personality has turned people out of my writing.

Artie says, with your history and the ever-changing climate, where do you see the industry going in the next 5, 10, 20 years? Games industry. That's a really big question. Jesus.

But no, I think the, you can't predict it, first of all, right? Like I can pontificate here and say like, well, it's gonna be all VR. It's not gonna be all VR. I agree with you. I think there'll be different experiences, just like phones have not replaced the PlayStation 4, because the PlayStation 4 is ****, you know, people are playing it. It's, it's, it's a big hit. I do think, you know, I do think this is do or die for Nintendo as a hardware maker. You know, like we've heard them, we've heard it described as a reboot where they going back and they said, we made a terrible mistake with the Wii U. They were not gonna say that. But the Wii U being this tablet that was tethered to your home. And like, I mean, I can't even take it to",
