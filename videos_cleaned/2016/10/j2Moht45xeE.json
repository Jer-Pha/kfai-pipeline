I know it's you, you postponed the honeymoon. I said, \"Can you come on the show this week? Nick Scarpino's dead.\" And you said, \"Yes.\" I said, \"Let's rebook the plane tickets, let's make this happen.\" Uh, Kinda Funny is my number one priority. I'm glad you understand that. I'm glad. I think your marriage was on strong ground if that's how it's been. If you're listening to the MP3, you're missing this spectacular Jersey you're wearing, Mrs. Sparkle.

It is weird though to see John constantly playing with his ring 'cause he never wears jewelry and this is the first piece of jewelry he's worn like consistently for more than a day at a time and he's just constantly playing with and like knocking it against things.

Because the more got that, the more butt you have, the more length you need because it pushes it out and then it doesn't fall as far to the ground.

That's creepy. But they liked this ghost. They said this ghost was nice. I remember I was a young kid. I don't remember the story anymore exactly. Yeah, exactly. All she did was walk around up there. No big deal. Now here's another terrifying story that is legitimately true. Bill and Betty Lasser chilling in their home in unincorporated Glen Ellyn, right? They're just there just doing whatever old people do in the house when they're not that old, but old. Side note, we'd go play UNO at their house a lot. This is what my parents chose for fun.
