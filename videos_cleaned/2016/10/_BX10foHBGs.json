Now we're going to start talking and now the gloves are off. I say so that was your thing. If you want to end the episode now, thanks supporters on Patreon. One of the things that that that I talked to you about when I first when I first saw it and came in the next day was I was like, I'm **** floored by the cast they have for the show. Yeah, the fact that they have Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins in a show together is ridiculous.

Um, and and I don't think he's actually this is one of those shows where he's actually shining right now in my eyes and it's shining and he doesn't age. Somehow perfect **** casting. He plays the perfect person, right? And then and then literally the that he's supposed to be the perfect guy, the hero. Um, and you don't know that in the beginning, but then you finally see it and it happens over and over and over again. And there's this slow twisted thing happening to him and he's nailing it in my opinion. Now granted, we're only on episode three, so we'll see what happens come episode nine and 10.

And so that Cy B and **** in her name probably nson. Shut up. The the production value is phenomenal. The way it shot is phenomenal. The fact that literally the same thing happens over and over and over and over again and it's **** riveting. So the pacing of the edit, everything, all that, the writing is great.

I'm like, let's watch it on your HBO Go account, which is great. And now I have to just keep watching it. It's I think a fantastic piece of sci-fi. And I give Kev dog credit because he was one of the people trying to get. Oh, no, I had it. I had it recorded. And then when he when you texted me, I was like, oh, ****, I didn't watch him yet.

And it's also the mashup of what you **** dorks like in Disneyland, right? Of like there is this like production, **** animatronics. Yeah, exactly. **** that Lincoln's face. No, it's that it's that mixup of video game and theme park shoved together, whatever. And then having role-playing like live action. **** cool. And it's total like that.

Now to be fair, I don't I'm not feing for it. Like I'm very much looking into the next episode. I'm not it's not on Game of Thrones level for me right yet. We'll see how it goes. Game of Thrones a couple episodes to get into. I feel like after the first episode, I was like, damn, I need more of this. After the second episode, I was like, oh, oh, I want more right now. After the third, really a little bit less for me. See, I and I've been outspoken before just like Game of Thrones just isn't my jam. I just I'm not a fan of the setting and everything else. This is I love the setting here both in the in Westworld and outside of Westworld. Like how they run this theme park. And then so yeah, I",

I'm I'm sure that's going to become more and more important. But I'm way more important or I'm way more into watching uh Dolores and like how quickly she gets wise to what's happening, what her motivation going be. I this is a this is one of those. I wish that I know it's impossible. It's a lot like comic books where I wish I could have waited like Colin is even though he'll have something ruined and be pissed off about it. But and I like being part of the conversation. I wish I could just marathon it all like a Netflix show because I would sit there and just go, do you know how many actual episodes they're going to do?

Um, the conversation like I love being able to like I'm excited about next week when you guys all hopefully catch up and we can sit down and be like, oh man, she watched yesterday this this and that. And I I want Tim to join so bad because I think he's going to love it. And I I've just, you know, my whole life's been those sort of conversations with Tim. Yeah, it's going to be interesting. And here's the thing, it's going to be interesting to see where they go, right? Because we had a cool twist right at the beginning, uh, which is not not revolutionary, but it was like, you're like, oh, they're going to **** with us a little bit. Like we're not we're not sure what's happening. Um, 10 10 episodes. So more am I so excited. And then we sort of are on this story line that's",

H uh, to me the main story is the the them kind of happening. Yeah, so nothing it's nothing like shocking crazy moment. Even the stuff with Thandie Newton, I was like, this is just beautifully done. And like it's shocking, but or like disturbing, but it's not on the level of like the Red Wedding, right? With Game of Thrones, right? So so we're we haven't gotten a like that. It's this cool sci-fi slow burn right in this beautifully **** crazy sci-fi environment juxtaposed with the Wild West. And even like some of the small things they do that I think is really, really cool that kind of brings you in is like the Mexican uh I looked up the locations, the the place they were in Mexico.

I don't think they really care to do anything to make it feel like it was an actual theme parks. And like **** with you because you have that you have Ed Harris sitting down with I forget the name, the guy from 187. And they're having this intense conversation. And then this brutal scene unfolds. Like what is happening with this **** show? But it's **** like that. I mean, it's that juxtaposition of those of those those sort of moments that really, really have drawn me in. So what do you think if them? I I guess what's the through line going to be?

Do you what's your prediction for that character? Because I think what's going to happen at some point is he's going to flip and be the hero. It turns out. You think so? I would agree with. I think the because the Maze gets referenced. I think when and I could be wrong on this when they were talking to Dolores, right? Or whatever. It seems like the Maze is for hosts. And I don't know if that's in the last episode. They made it seem that way. If the Maze is a like a test to be like, if you can get through this thing, then you are. Yeah, you found conscious. Are we going to find Arnold, right? Isn't that his name? Arnold at the center of it? A minute. Wait, partner. But do are you don't think Ed Harris is Arnold? No, I don't. No, no.",

Okay, that's not the way I took it though. What did you take it as? I took it as everyone that's younger thinks he's that person. But we have not seen who that person is in Anthony Hopkins' eyes. Sure. Anthony Hopkins, he knows all kinds of ****. And he's about as old as Anthony Hopkins. So my question, I think what happened is they had an argument and he's like, oh, he left and died when he really did. Now he's trying to go, you guys created this cool studio. I'm going to burn it down from the inside or I'm going to release these people because they're real humans and you're **** around.",

Yeah, I I I just think he's a guy that one day was like, I'm going to 100% this game and has been doing every single quest and journey and different variations for 30 years. Honestly, what it feels like to me in a way is it's it's the end of uh Groundhog Day, right? Like Groundhog Day is a really funny movie. And every when you talk, I think it's when Ivan Reitman or maybe it was Harold Ramis talked about it, right? That was supposed to be that he lived that day for five years every day.

Sure, sure. And he's just like, I know it's not for me, but I'm going to do this so that I the completionist syndrome is is satisfied. Yeah, because that's the thing of like too where it's like he went and you know, takes the guy scalp to get the the Maze map or whatever, right? But it was interesting when they're cutting back and forth to when um uh Thandie, you said what's her name? Thandie Thandie Newton when she's almost getting scalped by him, right? When Evan Rachel Wood's in the barn, he goes to scalp her too. It's I don't think the map was on every person, right? Like he's been going through systematically trying to figure out who has this.

Well, that's the other thing too is like people clearly know he's on this trail, doing playing this game, right? Because at some point something told that little girl to tell him more than was right or that it wasn't for him, whatever. It wasn't for him. What it was, she's like, go to the the whatever and go, but it's not meant for you. But it's not meant for you, right? I mean, so she shut off and then came back to herself. So someone that was that just be a program that was already set in there. That's possible too. That's possible too. Um, yeah, I thought they showed Arnold though.

No, that's what I'm saying. That's why I think there's got to be something. The Man in Black is got to be something. So but I mean ultimately like this is obviously based on I think it was Michael Crichton movie, not a book. I think he wrote a movie and it was called Westworld. I think it was Yul Brynner. But the the concept was originally and that it was a bunch of reporters coming to this brand new theme. It was Jurassic Park basically. Yeah, bunch of reporters coming to this brand new theme park that all these robots. And then lo and behold, one of the robots, they all start going crazy and killing all the humans.

Like what's going to happen? And it's similar to and this is why like it's got themes that that um Ex Machina had dealt with things like that. Like they talk about the Turing Test. They talk about what life is. And it just because it's not organic doesn't mean it's not alive, you know? So it's going to be really cool to see how this develops. Um, my only real concern with the series right now is like I want this to just be one season. I really just want it to be **** 10 Stellar episodes that **** blow your mind. And then boom, we're done. I don't want to see Anthony Hopkins wrestle with something else in season two, right? If he makes it out of the",

And at some point, Jeffrey Wright's going to probably have to take up the mantle. It doesn't matter. Well, I'm interested to see who's going to turn out to be a host in the support staff. That's exactly. There's got to be somebody there who they don't know or like you. I mean, the host doesn't know. Or I was like, at first I thought Anthony Hopkins was going to turn out to be a host. But then we see a young picture or the young thing of him. But then even then, maybe he uploaded his or did something to that effect. I don't know. That's possible.

Yes. Ed Harris, they ricochet him off like he's in The Matrix. And then used to get then the other guy gets shot and knocked down on their like forums.

Also, have you seen Ed Harris? Badass. No, he's got leathers on. Leathers. There you go. He's got a set of leathers on. It's all cool and ****. And they're also not and then they're little sand sand blaster little balls. Here's okay. Yes. So you would be positive, man. You'd be like the hero. Yeah, I'd be a Superman kind of. I think I would do that for a second. Then I'd be like, I'm taking these two **** in the back and I'm going to pay for some goodness. That's a bad thing. And by paying, I mean not paying. Oh, man.

You're absolutely right. Because I it's a very interesting concept to be able to do whatever the **** you want. Would you be a person that would snap someone's neck, rape someone just to see you could do it? Like the idea of it bothers me. The idea of rape bothers me. Therefore, I don't want to explore it. Shooting someone. I I don't know if I would shoot someone. I think exploration or like an event that would be fun being around it and like drinking a lot and playing the piano and oh, gambling.
