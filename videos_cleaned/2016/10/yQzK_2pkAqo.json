When we went to Toronto, no, I went to Vancouver a couple times. Then we went to Toronto, probably ten hours. What up, Frank Furlong? Yeah, first time on all those years of covering it. I never went to, I never got the Ubisoft trips up there. I never had to go do anything up there. I never was a part of that. Yeah, you like it? Love it. It's amazing. Great city, right?

Everybody, you jump in at Austin, we're gonna Torchy's Tacos left and right. Yeah, but I feel like there's great Torchy's Tacos. I'm cueing in on and I'm eating those over and over.

So the poutine I had of the four out of five and four days, right? Chez Claudette. Just went there and had classic brown gravy, cheese curds. Right now here, this is the, this is one of the few times in my life I talk about, I tell the story once in a while about Ghostbusters. I'm in the theater for Ghostbusters. If I'm lying, I'm dying. I'm little Greggy Miller sitting next to his mom. I want to look cool next to my mom. Of course, this is 1989. I'm six years old. I'm not some little kid. I'm a grown-up.

I can't stop grinning. I smile. I'm trying not to smile. I can't stop smiling. I take this first stab of my first-ever Montreal Quebec poutine, put in my mouth, bite into it. The cheese squeaks. And it, I am reminded months, maybe years ago, the first time I ever told some day I was eating poutine, somebody on Twitter was like, and it was like, I think yet, I like Richmond Draught House or whatever, similar to that draught house. But it makes you say that house. This is your Miller's Planet to me. I in it squeaks. And I said, it's not real poutine unless it squeaks. I don't know what that meant.

Now earlier in this trip, Jen had said, well, a lot of people tell you to go to, to La Banquise. I need to stop. Yeah, sure. What did that have to do with Ghostbusters? I couldn't stop smiling. I started laughing out loud. Okay, Steinbeck. Well, let's not forget. Remember John Steinbeck? I'm a 33-year-old eating some **** cheese. I don't want to look. I bite it, squeaks. And the steward and I start laughing. She now she had said ahead of time, she wanted to take me to Chez Claudette. Everyone would say, go to La Banquise or whatever it. Right? I'm butchering that, but who cares? Now I said, we'll go to both. And she said, no, you don't do. You can't do two poutines in five days because the tech me I was",

And so what happens is I destroy this woman who actually works out and looks good unlike me. We go there, Chez Claudette. Have this. All right. I have a baseline of what Montreal Quebec poutine is gonna be. Right? Then we go out. We're going out to the cabin in the woods, way up in the hills. All right. We're going out as a little cabin. On the way there though, we're like, we're getting hungry. And accused in my mind, a brunch conversation we had with one Mitch Dyer, who we have been talking about the next chapter.

And I said, game on. In my head, I'd say, Esther face course, game on in my head. So we're driving. We're getting out the intersect. Oh, we're hungry. We're still an hour from this cabin of mine. What if we go and ask this McDonald's to try the poutine? She's like, I mean, we pull off. We go in there. They got the touchscreen. This is a big thing over there. You know what I mean? Also, side note, this is one of the epilogues, maybe a footnote in Chapter two. They were, I wish it was an epilogue, but it's not. At McDonald's, at McDonald's, now they're running the Justice League Action Heroes and the Super Hero Squad thing. So I get some Green Arrow glasses and Plastic Man figurine.

However, though, we get the touch screen classic poutine. Again, I want to try what McDonald's classic poutine is. Then it turns out McDonald's getting **** fancy and they have buffalo chicken poutine. You better believe we ordered both of them. And I tried both of them, Tim. And if I'm lying, I'm dying, McDonald's is making **** great poutine. Good food. Is it possible for poutine to be bad? It's a topic we'll come back to. It's a topic we'll come back to. I've had again, we're in the States, of course. Yeah, really. But not at Richmond Draught House. We'll come back to it. This is the whole thing we're throwing.

It's called T-Rex 'cause it's all the meats. The T-Rex about T-Rex. Thank you very much for any was speaking audience. It's french fries. We go with the BBQ gravy. Now I thought this sounded gross. It turns out it's just, it's a different kind, a little bit more of a spiced cream. It's not barbecue sauce. That was my concern. Right? You're with me, Tim? I'm with you. Thank you very much.

Buckwheat pancake festival. One of these small things. Right? Sounds good. And Jen's talking to me as if I've never seen something like this before.

Like all these farms get down in this really weird downtown. And like, you know, there's a lake and they're all talking about the tourism in the other stuff. As we're going though, she's pointing out snack bars. So in Quebec, there's all these different snack bars along the side of the road. And they, and I'm like, oh, that's amazing.

They're there for you get food on. We're coming back again, the same thing at the end of the night because we went, we went out into a spa, had a massage. Let me tell you, you want to talk about some calling, if I'm lying, I'm dying, you gotta get to the next Canadian. Sorry, this place, man. I don't know. They wouldn't come out.

And so I'm like, let's try one of these snack bars. We pull over at a snack bar, Tim. I'm lying, I'm dying. We pull over a Resto La Petite Bouffe. Now this is the menu I have here. Right? It's adorable. Is it there? It's there. I have many notes in it, so I'll need it back.

They also have hamburgers, two hot dogs, all this different stuff. They put the dollar sign on the wrong side. I think that's what they do there. I didn't get, I'm not fully briefed on their money. But again, look how cheap those prices are. Four trios of food. Two pogos. Now this, it broke up on two.
