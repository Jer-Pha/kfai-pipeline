Now, Tim, you're here in PlayStation VR Worlds. Worth pointing out, of course, for the FTC that the unit we are reviewing here for PlayStation VR and all the games were provided by PlayStation for our review. Uh, tell me a little bit about VR Worlds. I haven't played this one. Are you, do you see my controller on? I do see your controller on the screen. Cool. It's so fancy. So VR Worlds is what I think the the most important uh launch title, the most important launch title. Yeah, so it is. It's super cool. It gives you a bunch of different experiences. Uh, it comes with the the launch bundle. So if you buy the launch bundle that has the camera, the Move ones, it's here. And if not, it's like 40 bucks, $40 to just buy it. So it's five games that you can play. And like even just this like intro screen, I think is super cool 'cause like obviously it's 3D to you.",

Yeah, you're in a rotunda. PlayStation VR Worlds for throughout the four, the five games. One is an underwater game, one is like a space game, one is a a heist game. So there's bullets and stuff. The the room kind of changes and so fills with water and stuff. It's it's really it's a cool experience. It remi- that's the thing is like this is from, I'm sorry, it reminds me of what when you watch a movie before the movie plays, it's like experience Dolby sound. This is it's a really good way to show off why VR is cool. Now this is from Sony London, of course, uh and these are a couple demos we've seen before. Ocean Descent, is that shark one?

And uh it's it was, you know, it's a little bit more of an interactive movie than anything else. But seeing the shark come up, it's it's really cool. It's a it's a fun experience. But like whatever, it is what it is. Then we got Danger Ball. Danger Ball. I don't know. Danger Ball. Danger Ball is super super awesome. Okay. Um, I'm going to go in real quick and I'll show it for a sec. We want to show a little bit of everything, right? Worth showing. Let's go to to Quick Play. Quick Play this mofo, is I like to say.

But you're saying it's more than what we've demoed before, right? Uh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. It's a it's a bigger experience. Like that part we played where you're in the car, that's like in the middle of it. Okay, here comes Danger Ball. So this is cool. If you you can see, I feel like I'm in Tron right now, of course. Uh, and yeah, so we we've seen people demo this game to, you know, not great results. But pretty much he's going to hit the thing over to me and I just control with my head.

I don't know how he's doing all that. 'Cause your car, how you feeling car sick wise? 'Cause watching this, I'm not I'm having trouble. Oh, I'm totally fine. Moving with me, it like, oh right, that makes sense. That makes a lot of sense. I don't know how he's doing this like grab thing. I mean, you put down the controller. Are you sure you don't need the controller for grabby? It's just your head. But the grabbies. Oh, oh my God. Try opening your mouth and biting it. There you go.

I want to know how you're feeling about it because, you know, I think on the barometer of PlayStation VR or VR in general, Colin's the most positive. I'm behind him. And then you were always the one was like, I don't know. Yeah. And I mean, here's my thing. Is it a lot of fun? Absolutely. And like with all the the games we get to play, it's super cool. I love being able to show my friends for the first time. But it's kind of exactly what I thought it would be. Like, I don't know that I necessarily need to own this. Um, but again, I'm very privileged in the fact that like so many of my friends have them. I can borrow it whenever I want. Um, but the experiences are cool.

They remind me of um arcade games that the the premium arcade games back in the day where you'd pay a dollar to be able to like hit punch with the punch things or like Episode I Racer. You're in the car and all that stuff. Luge is very much like that. You're just kind of sitting and like using Rock. There's a very infamous video I put on Instagram of me, the Team Fat shirt, on a bean bag tilting my head and it's cool. Um, so then so yeah, like we're I was talking about London Heist is my favorite thing. But I I actually The Best For Last. Yes. Well, yes, 'cause it is the best.

I was just throwing that out there that uh let's let's go a little bit into it because the tutorial is a little a little slow. Okay, okay, okay. But you're an expert. You've been playing. I am an expert. What's it about? Um, you essentially are in a mech like like an alien. I like this aliens. Yeah. And uh you are so you see my mech. Oh yeah. So you control it with a controller. And now this is one of the more more typical like uh first person shootery things where you actually you control it like a normal first person shooter, but then you aim with this. Oh, okay.

I mean, there's a story. You're getting places. Okay. You're you know, it's not just like an experience. Like this is a real from what you've played. These are are they all real games? Are they all 'cause it seems like I was worried about this disc being just tech demos. Nope. Uh, so Descent's not a real game. Okay. Descent is very much just like interactive movie thing. How long is that interaction movie taking? Uh, probably 10 minutes, I'd say. For there's a couple maybe more than that. I don't know. I was down there for a while. You were descending this whole time. Yeah. So Descent was there's a couple chapters though. So got I didn't play all of them. Okay, okay. Um, but",

We got some Alien Nation business up here. A powerful energy from that Crystal entity. But yeah, this is really cool. Like a lot of people played um Battle Zone. Well, this Battle Zone. But then also uh what's the other one? The EVE Valkyrie. Yeah, yeah. And like that's super cool. But this I feel like uh at least compared to the Valkyrie demo that we you get with PS VR, this is a little bit more uh try to fix location. Someone's at the door. Yeah, aiming with your head's really satisfying. Is it? But is it like make you sick at all? Greg, I'm concerned about that. Yeah, this game definitely makes you sick.

I don't know if I was getting sick with every game, but this one seems like it's a mind-bending. Yeah, there's a lot of Inception stuff going on. So it's like when you make the jumps mid jump, you have two jumps. So while you're making your way to one jump, you can look at a different target and then jump over there. Gotcha. This reminds you a lot of the Flood in Halo. See these little dudes? They're jumping around. They're trying to mess my day up. Trying to start. Going to let them do that though. I'm jumping around all nimbly bimbly like nimbly bimbly. Yeah, it is kind of disorienting, but it's fun. You know, all matter. There's a part in this earlier.

I finish all because I'm been trying to play a little bit of everything. Yeah, no, I understand. We wanted to taste for everything to talk about VR. Yeah, my money is between Until Dawn: Rush of Blood and um this here London. No, Batman. Batman's cool. Batman's awesome. Batman. I I got to give uh props to Batman 'cause they they really went above and beyond. Not Batman Beyond. Yeah, no, that'd be awesome.

Hexa Cube is I think uh Graham's game. Gotcha. You're right. Um, that one's awesome. So let's get right into this. Here we go. So you got two motion controllers in front of you. I'm going to need some help. One, two. Playing VR without someone around you, very difficult. Well, all you do is you hit the little button. You pull it out. You look down.
