So it's so funny hearing you guys talk about all this because I mean, I am from such a a different uh cloth when it comes to all this, where I very much am the video guy, but I never thought of it as just like, oh, I'm going to make videos of everyone else's written articles. It was always from the ground up. I'm making a video. And I think that that kind of like, you know, you were talking about being uh part of the second class after after Peer and them, kind of the blueprint that they made.

Like we had Fran and Nick and Eric and Ty and all those guys, and they kind of Brendan and and Chris Baron, yeah, Craig Baron. They uh defined what the Tallahassee Kid or Supple. You were watching that video in the office today that like somebody said this video almost got two people fired. Yeah, well, I mean, so for talk about that some other, well, I'll tell about now. It's it's like the best thing ever. So IGN Insider, I mean, that was like kind of the the big push into premium video content on the internet. And like we're talking early 2000s, so 2004, 2005. So pre-YouTube. And what IGN was doing with video was like, it was next level. There was CollegeHumor, there was a couple other sites, but like I remember seeing this, I was an IGN Insider subscriber, and I was like, this is awesome that they they are doing this this crazy",

When you look at now, it's absolute garbage. But like we're talking about like Fran's Closet. They send two guys to TGS and they're like, make video content. They're like, do what, do whatever you want, just make video, make premium video. No, it was go to TGS and give people a feeling as to what it's like there. So what they did was they decided to make a a Western, mhm, in two guys from Louisiana. They like, ****. So they made this like sprawling epic that was like 10 minutes long in two parts. And it's like, why, why, why would you do that? But then the the best other example is Fran's Closet, which you should YouTube right now. Just look up Fran's Closet and you you'll find it. That was a God of War video exclusive. That was a God of War exclusive, a Nick Scarpino special. So you guys are going to going to love it.",

Um, it's essentially them making fun of their boss, our former boss, one of our very good friends, Fran Mirabella. You might know the third. Uh, but it was a God of War II preview, an exclusive preview. So instead of just showing the game, they decided to make a 10-minute thing that had a 5-minute intro of them sneaking into Fran's Closet, where there's this like horrible **** going on. There's Craig Baron's butts in the video. Um, they they spent so much money on props. Like they had a prop budget that was like $1,000. And I'm like, God of War, this beautiful game. They put like a Grindhouse filter on the entire filter on top of the game. And they had the each other race. And like it's just Nick in a horrible accent. He's playing a character, Uncle Lou, and",

But I remember watching that, not that specifically, but that type of content and being like, man, like they're doing this. Like they are making content out of it. And it was very very inspiring to me. And pretty much instantly, I've told the story many times, but like I knew what I wanted to do. And what I wanted to do was make internet video. I didn't want to make movies. I didn't want to make TV shows. I wanted to make internet video. And I'm definitely probably the the first generation people to even have that as an option. You you came in and like I think you challenged kind of like our setup too. And you did too, right? Right? Like I think there was one one time in your career where I said, why are you in editorial?

And you were you were a person I remember coming in basically being the writer, performer, ideator. Like you did it all. You're like the YouTuber basically, right? And and it was really hard to figure out how to make that work in our setup because like you could you would be like, oh, I'm going to make a video about how this franchise is ****. And then the editors are like, whoa, hold on. We don't think of ****. Like how are we going to do that? Right? And then that was kind of the the challenge. And that's what was was interesting where it's like, you know, you guys kind of perfected what it means to uh write preview coverage, review coverage of video games.

And for me, it's like from day one, it was like, how do we just make content out of this? Like taking all of that out of it. Like how is it content? And it's it's so interesting because for me, Fran was like the dude. Like was the guy. Like he was always the the one holding me back or pushing me forward. Like it was like that push and pull relationship that's necessary to learn and to understand that you're not always right, even when you think you are and all that stuff. And I think that they kind of had you for that. But what's interesting with me, me and your relationship is very special to me because you are one of the Nintendo guys of which there are very few in games media, cuz everyone wants to hate",

And so also Nintendo just, you know, hires the ones that are really okay. So uh but whenever like cool cool stuff would happen, like we would always be able to talk about it and be excited about it. And like the few times I was on NVC, it was awesome. Yeah. But in addition to that, whenever I did something that was super outside the box of what IGN does, um in terms of video, you always pulled me aside and were like, that was awesome. Or like, how do we do this more? And you always were were pushing that. I respected that a lot because I knew you were on the other side. You know, you were like more of the the editorial dude. It reached a point where you're just like the grand overlord of everything. But you always helped. You never got in the way. You always helped. There was a lot of",

You always helped. There was a lot of people getting in the way, but you were always trying to support the people that were self-starters. And that continues to this day. And I think that's the important part. When you what Greg was saying is so accurate. You look around IGN, um and a lot of uh internet companies like this, like even ourselves. And it's like every single person around you needs to be that way and is that way. And it's motivating and it pushes you. And it it's when you hear no, it stings because you're just like, but I'm going to do it anyway. It's an issue for for I mean, for creative people, right? And like when you guys started creating content outside of IGN as well, it's like, oh, ****, what do we do about that? Right? Like there could be now conflicting messaging outside of IGN by people who are at IGN. And it's like, we",

Like there could be now conflicting messaging outside of IGN by people who are at IGN. And it's like, we always say, well, creators got to create, right? Like you have to build kind of like this playground, let people loose. But I can also afford being the element of chaos at IGN when I'm not the editor-in-chief or the managing editor, right? Like this person has to make sure that the review is up um on the day that the game comes out or before, because otherwise the audience will be mad, right? And they do get mad. You guys know that. And and um and so I'm I I could always afford being the guy saying like, no, let them experiment with it. Because if they didn't have the review up, I could also be the guy saying, what the **** are you guys doing? Why is the review late? Right? And so like I I think the um the Destiny podcast is a great example where I think like Destiny and Jose uh basically just started doing a",

And I think there were a couple people mad on the team saying like, well, we need a Destiny to do this other thing. And like that was one of those points where I said, guys, like, you can't stop that. You can't stop that because like it we wouldn't have Beyond!, we wouldn't have Rewind Theater, Daily Fix, IGN Weekly, any of this stuff. We wouldn't be on IGN and Snapchat. We wouldn't have these things. We wouldn't be on YouTube. If if you didn't just say, you know what, I'm going to let this go. I'm going to let this run and see where it ends up. Because you can always later on say, hey, we're going to dial back. And like you got to have that. You got to have that courage",

You got to have that courage to also say, we've been doing this for a long time, stop it. Right? Like writing previews, for example. Remember we used to write, be like, game comes out in two weeks. Robot must write preview. Here's what's in Game: 100 levels, number of maps, high definition graphics, right? 100 Maps. Like we we had to let that go at one point. And like it's hard, you know, it's hard to do that. So I mean, so kind of like looking at all of this. So talking about the different waves, whether it's the editorial or video or now this kind of watch read mentality where it is both editorial and video or written in video. How how is it kind of transitioning between those different things? And how have you been able to to manage being there from the beginning and and seeing it all? And where do you see it going? Yeah, it's so comp it's the",

Yeah, it's so comp it's the world is much more complicated now, honestly. And like what we have managed to do is like the days where people are up around the clock. And remember like my E3s where Matt and I would not go to sleep like for three days. And like it was not good for our health, right? We would just say, hey, we have this kind of completionist attitude where we got to write about Putt-Putt's Great Barbie Adventure or whatever, right? Like because it's on the N64. It was a badge of pride. Like that's the thing for my E3s. Like you were in the trenches and you knew everybody was in there. And I'll never forget my end of my first E3, Damon trying to tell me, you don't need to write this preview right now about Babysitters Club Murder Adventure on DS. I'm like, it's the last. And it was like 10:30 and everybody was going out to 7",

And it was like 10:30 and everybody was going out to 7 Grand. I'm like, no, I have to do this. And so we we've we've stopped that. Like, you know, when when you go to IGN now at 6:00 p.m., there there may be a person there. There may be a person somewhere working on something. But generally, we want to make sure people get out. That said, people then probably go home and play video games, which you know, they use that knowledge tomorrow on on kind of creating a feature and stuff. So you never fully switch off and you're always on social. But we've tried to get at least the kind of we try to limit the amount of time that people put into on a daily basis so that they do have some free time. And they also need that free time to be creative and create the next thing, right? Because like for a while, we were just kind of going and doing the same thing. And so the next",

Because like for a while, we were just kind of going and doing the same thing. And so the next thing for us, first of all, the internet has changed. You can't just put out a website and like look at Comscore and quote advertisers or, you know, people in uh studios and publishers. The numbers doesn't work like that anymore. Right now, we have platforms like Facebook, we have YouTube, we have Instagram, we have Snapchat, all Twitch, all these different places out there. And suddenly you have this, you have this crazy challenge of getting all your content to all these different places. And then once you do that, you have the even bigger challenge of saying like, ****, the thing that worked on YouTube is not working on Twitch. The games that YouTubers care about, Twitch viewers don't care about. The stuff that works on IGN is not working on Snapchat. You know what our biggest story was on Snapchat Discover?",

It was Finding Dory, right? Finding Dory was the biggest thing on Snapchat. It's so different from the web. And so that's the big challenge is try to figure out how to track all this stuff, how to produce all that stuff, how to have the right voice for all the platforms. And then the big scary one, how do you monetize all that? Because you can't serve the same ads across all these different platforms. You guys know that, right? Like you're afforded the freedom to create because you have this wonderful mechanism in Patreon where people, you're not the man, right? You're like, hey, sponsor us, we can create, get this awesome content just for you. And that works. I can't do that, right? I can't say",

I can't do that, right? I can't say, hey, give us your Patreon dollars, right? And so I got to figure out how to monetize all all that in different ways. And man, it's hard. It's hard to grow a business when the internet is so fragmented, where at any point Zuckerberg can say, and now Facebook is the second internet. And everything that goes in there does not work outside. So that's the big challenge, but that's also the big opportunity. And uh single edition of IGN and Snapchat, you said like your review got read by by two million people. Snapchat can do that in a day for one review. And it's insane, right? These numbers are so big. And so the concept of having all these kind of different mechanisms and getting to your content to an even bigger audience is super exciting to me.

Like how do you kind of see the vision of the content creators? I still I still think we suffer a little bit from the fact that we have been around for such a long time. So you still have these silos, right? There's some companies like on the engineering side, you have like product and engineering being one team, whereas in ours, it's still separate. We have moved video and edit closer together. It used to be literally that when you go to the IGN office, and again, if you're in town on the 14th, we're doing a tour, um you can see that there would be like an area for video people, an area for editors, right?",

So we're breaking those uh walls down. Um but there's still kind of segment, there's still segmentation like that. But we don't hire writers anymore. Like every person who comes in to interview for a writing job, even for Wiki, like a Wiki strategy guide paid position internally, we now do a screen test. We put them on camera and we see how they are. And we're not looking for like a perfect anchor or anchorwoman. We're looking for somebody has that spark, right? Like that connection.

Now Darrin handles all social video. So anything that is created for kind of the Facebook or Snapchat platforms. Yeah, because the videos are so different. What what performs on Facebook? You guys know this. No, exactly. Again, I got to give a shout out to Darrin, man. Like what he's doing, I honestly think that where IGN's at right now is since I've been visiting the site, like probably my favorite content to consume. I think that they it's finally they're kind of acting on the trends instead of being super far behind in terms of video stuff, in terms of the social stuff.

And IGN is the best at that product. But in terms of all the other stuff, I think that um with Snapchat and with a lot of the social video stuff, they are now paving the way for the future. Like you guys being on the Discover platform before anyone else. Like I see other Snapchat um curators and and content um creators doing what IGN did. Like copying the the formats that you guys made. And I think that's super awesome that you're pushing a new thing ahead, a new platform. And IGN is no longer just a website. IGN is this thing that is on every single platform and different on every single platform. Yeah.

Um it's hard to do. Um and so that kind of stifles your creativity too, right? Because there's certain types of content that can reach millions of viewers on Facebook that you guys could quite frankly fart out. Like you guys are fully equipped to do that. You just got to put text on this screen because people don't watch unmuted. And you got to have some fun with stuff and create memes. Um but why, right?

There a lot of teens there, a lot of younger people. It has a bigger a female audience than male audience. Like I looked at that platform, I'm like, I don't get it. Like what what do you where do you even start? Right? Right? Like how do you create this content? And so then you experiment and you hire people who know and who are active. And Darrin is a big Snapchatter, right? Like he was able to just kind of jump in and say like, oh no, what you're doing is all wrong. IGN First, nobody's going to care about IGN First.

I mean, again, I commend you guys for for listening to that, adapting with all that stuff. Cuz cuz when I like I was there during the whole YouTube shift. And that was hard because that that was the thing. It's like IGN was very much they they knew because they invented what video was. But then with YouTube, it's like I was coming in. I'm like, no, you got to do it this way. And I feel like then we had Start and we had all this stuff. And it's like looking back on it, Start I think was a very like one of the most important steps for for IGN. Yeah, because it created this idea that personalities do matter. Um and that making fun content, just content for the sake of it being content that people are going to consume as",
