Uh, listen, no, we got quite a show for you, you piece of ****. No, but seriously, um, we're recording this show super out of order and it's gonna be kind of a weird show. We already shot topics three and four with a very special guest, Greg Kaneshiro. Nailed it. You know that Greg Kaneshiro, who is the most fascinating human being in the entire world when it comes to video games. He is uh, the creator of Xbox Live Arcade. Yep. He was here to check out, to have us check out one of his new things he's working on, Sparse Arcade, his new game, which you'll hear all about it. And my God, it's all very fascinating.

So I just wanted to prepare that, let you guys know that that's happening in the future. The first couple topics here probably gonna be a bit, a little bit shorter. It'll easily something, maybe, maybe one of them for sure. One of them for sure will be. We're gonna be doing reviews of the Mafia 3, yeah, and of Gears of War 4. Gears of War 4 probably gonna be a shorter topic, but we're just letting you know that so you can prepare yourselves on whatever you're getting some real good stuff later.

I think that Mafia 3's presentation in terms of its story, its voice acting, its characters and character development, I think it's fantastic. I think that they really nailed that. I think there's a lot of compelling characters. For those that don't know, it does take place in the same world as Mafia 2. Vito Scaletta is actually, who was the protagonist in Mafia 2, is actually one of your associates in Mafia 3's. In the game takes place in 1968 in a place what, New Bordeaux, which is New Orleans, just their fictional version of New Orleans. And it's you play as a black man named Lincoln Clay. That's important because the Deep South is incredibly racist and then the 1960s. He comes back from Vietnam. He's a decorated soldier. He's also a special ops kind of guy, so he's a lot of special training and stuff like that. He comes back, he",

He's also a special ops kind of guy, so he's a lot of special training and stuff like that. He comes back, he has an adopted kind of family that took him in when he was younger. Push comes to shove, it's very early in the game and I want to spoil it for anyone, so you don't want any spoilers, you can go away for 15, don't bother, just go away for the next 15 seconds. 15 seconds. But the very close to beginning of the game, his family's killed by the mob and he has to, he basically goes out on, hears and half T, but he goes out on a revenge tour basically to seize at the assets of of this particular mobster through all of his lieutenants and Capos and then to work his way up to the top. So the whole foundation of it's great. It's just that everything else isn't great and the game is a little half-baked. A lot of technical problems.

Well, I saw the Reddit GIF of the car on the overpass turning off of the overpass and then just continuing to drive as if there was nothing, nothing too weird in terms of like gameplay things that you wouldn't expect that but necessarily like not world. No, I, the game's crashed probably four or five times. I mean, like just crash in the middle of whatever and I have to restart wherever, you know, the last checkpoint. That's one thing. There's severe and significant lighting issues in the game. I've never seen it. I've never seen anything like it in my life actually. I played everyone. I played this two guys on the couple hours he plays. Yeah, I played many video games.

And the sunrises, it's like you're on the servers on Mercury. Like you can't see anything. Then like it, the sun goes down, you're in the Bayou or whatever and you just can't **** see. It's just dark. Now I understand you're in the Bayou and it's supposed to be dark, but at the video game, I need to be able to see like where I'm going. Is there's a problem when you go in and out of buildings on where like sometimes the lighting just doesn't turn on inside a building. So like it's just dark inside. There's just a lot of weird unreal. I just don't really understand. Like I've never seen a game box lighting like this. Like I don't, I",

It's extremely stupid and easy manipulate because you're doing the same things in the game over and over again. So, so the structure of the game is very similar to, you know, Mafia. I actually really kind of said what a Godfather 2, if anyone played that, the a game, which I actually think is a, you know, I have to say a much better game. I played it what, now seven years ago or whatever. But in terms of gameplay, in terms of what you're doing, I actually remember really liking Godfather 2. I could really give, you know, not, I don't like Mafia 3's gameplay look as much. The basic thing is that New Bordeaux is separating the segments, you know, little sectors basically.

And then within there are different rackets that you have to take over to draw the Capo out. And the idea is really cool because you're basically doing monetary damage to their take, which is a, you know, an interesting thing that the the rackets are controlled so that there's a take of $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, whatever it is. So you're going around like murdering people or like stealing money or like destroying trucks and like ammo and all these kinds of things. And every time you do a little score thing gonna happen in the corner saying like you've removed this much more money out of their pockets and this much more money in other pockets. You get it down to zero, then you can attack the racket. And it's a nice idea, except for the fact that like you just do the same thing over and over and over and over again. It is just so",

This is what I saw thrive. Like this is the thing that the game sounds like a PS3 game or you're on a PS2 game. It sounds like Spider-Man. Right? There's all these limited interactions to go be the hero. Granted, a different thing, but you nursing, I'm saying is that like they have this giant open world, they have this cool story, but there's not doing interesting things with it. Yeah, it's like there's, there's at the at the at the core of the game is something really interesting, which is like, I like it. Like the, I was talking about the Bayou before. The Bayou is at the south end of New Bordeaux and and it's she's VAT. It's probably half the map. The these kind of, it's like a delta, you know, and and the these disparate elements are like, you know,",

And you're constantly going down there to like deal with them. And it's cool. It's a nice idea, but there's just no real variety to what you're doing. In a game like this with a story that's good and a voice acting cast is good and a plot kind of idea and setting this good, the gameplay must serve the story, but it doesn't. It's basically a distraction. I'm playing through the game just to get to the story instead of playing the game because I want to play the game. And I play it very meticulously where I'm finding all the collectibles and the Playboy magazines and the and the Vargas paintings and and all these little switches and stuff like that that you used to take over call boxes basically as a whole mechanic there.

But it just, it just comes off as very half-baked. And what I'm interested in is like how much of the game, you know, a different studio was working on this game in the beginning. I'm curious like if any of it was taken from, you know, it was a 2K Prague or something like that and they were shut down. And then Hangar 13 was basically opened up in Novato, which is just north of San Francisco. And I'm not saying Nevada, I'm saying Novato. And they made this game. And I don't know if it's like all theirs or some theirs or what. I don't know the whole situation, but it reeks of a game that is just didn't, wasn't given enough time. It didn't make it. You know, I was kind of saying that I wasn't worried about the quality of the game for 2K did not release the codes early. Now I understand completely why they didn't release the codes",

And then it just doesn't go anywhere. The story's interesting. That's the movie. Yeah, exactly. Like the story is really cool because you're working like incidentally with the CIA agent that you worked with in Vietnam. And all the gangsters are really cool. These like different characters. Sal Marcano, my Uncle Lou, who's kind of like, he's always on the radio. He's like the super southern **** dude. And but he's like a criminal and you always hear him on the radio. You see me on the street, maybe I'll buy you a whiskey. Yeah, it's like, it's all like all the characters are great.

And like there's all these like weird **** going on that's like really cool. Makes it die now. I'm much more dynamic story. The Mafia 2's and I thought Mafia 2's story was really cool. And I think Vito's inclusion in Mafia 3 as one of your lieutenants is **** awesome. Like I think that's really cool. I think Vito Scaletta's character is an interesting character too. But and also seeing getting out of the Italian kind of thing where it's like the black mob, the Irish mob, the you know, the Haitian mob, all these kinds of different thing.

And all the little cool ideas in the game, like the little gameplay tweaks are neat, but they're also a little half-baked. I was talking about the call boxes before. You find these fuses. There are way too many of them in the game. I don't know why. I probably have 180 on them right now. Like and use three at a time to hack these call boxes basically. And then it gives you information on where enemy locations are, where collectible locations are. Makes the game easier if you do them. And then there's this other idea where like, and I really like this idea. So the game plays up a lot of its, it actually opens with an thinking like there's a overt racism in this game.

You're talking about it opens with this letter from developers, right? And they're basically like, we don't agree with this. This is not what we would say or how we would act, but we think it's important to include this so you understand the historical reference and where that were super **** racist game. But that's the story of the game. I'm not saying that they they're wrong without ever saying like there's there's an interesting story and a boldness to this particular game that I don't think is is is met with its story.

But there's like these weird things where like someone will call cops on me almost every time I steal a car. But if I like bash into a store and steal cash in front of them and like knock someone over, they they're like, \"I'm gonna call the cops.\" But no one ever calls. Not once. I've been in the hundred of these stores. No one's ever called the cops. Right? The cops are easy enough to manipulate to like you can just hide. Like they don't really look for you very carefully. You can really you any left on the D-pad lets you whistle. So if you're behind covers, it was like, \"What?\" Well, and then like walks over you.",

And I'm really diving because I really like Mafia and I'm really diving in and trying. I'm like I said, I'm finding all the fuses, all the collectibles, doing, you know, but at the end of the day, like it's just kind of a muddled mess. Oh my God. I think it's fine. I don't think it's bad by any stretch of imagination, but it is not, it's not as good of Mafia 2, which is shocking. And it's it had this potential to be a very great, a great case.

And who's Marcano, I think his name is. And you like each lieutenant, each of the two lieutenant pairs are attached to a Capo.

It's it's a nice story of revenge, but the it just it's been not, it's just they didn't, it needed another like year. It needed like a design. I think that like one of the things that it lacks is you said it needed a design. Like there's no design there. There's no, you're not doing anything different. Like to take over the rackets, you're doing the same thing over and over and over again. There might be a different story tweak or something like that, but you're basically just, you can slink through and no one sees you. You can just go in guns blazing. Doesn't really **** matter.

So there's a cool little system there. And they can actually turn on you and then you have to actually go kill them. And I'm trying to keep them all happy with me. So I'm like distributing things equally between them and hopefully everyone's cool with it. Burke's getting a little antsy. Hasn't really got anything that guy.

Holy, do you think this game would have benefited if it was an open-world, if it was a bit more linear? No, I don't know because the complain about Mafia III was that it had this open world that was empty like that it wasn't it wasn't done the k checkered k programmer the **** made it was was they had this really nice idea that's nice narrative and an interesting gameplay but but the world does move",

I don't know that would have fixed it, alleviated the problem, maybe a widow because it would have force to do this story but then who would have cared because it's just games like The Getaway don't really exist anymore where it's like you want more than you're getting.

Mafia III came out years ago, you know, yeah, they learned their lessons. Yeah, but then I'm actually I'm surprised because I agree with what you're saying in the sense that I saw your tweets about the game and I kind of looked into it and saw what everyone else was saying and I don't think I've seen a game that isn't either universally",

So yeah man, we were talking about you know earlier New Year Doom but that's a release Doom and it released Doom and they we didn't get codes until the game came out or like where should we worried about it and end up doing it ended up being the Doom was one of the best games of the year.

I think that they held it cuz they knew, you know, like that they absolutely know and I don't quite understand reach their metrics and they have these release dates and all these kinds of things but I think that given a little bit more time and a little bit more maturation of the ideas there that this game could have been fantastic because they have these really they have this story, these characters but they just they it's it's like two different games.

The CIA agent, Lincoln Clay, Father James, the priest, all the lieutenants, all the mobsters. This is a really robust kind of thing they got going on and it's just not served or serviced by the game. And so what I said on PS I Love You XOXO, I don't think this is worth $60. I think it might be worth investigating a twenty or thirty dollars if you want but I I I certainly don't endorse it the way I thought I was going to.

Yeah, so I don't the worry about anywhere. I don't want to stop now. I put so much time in. Oh, but I'm certainly I've told myself now I'm not gonna be so meticulous. I got getting all the collected collectibles and some of that's half the time I'm spending anyway just running around like a **** **** looking for Playboy magazines. So I was like real life for adolescents. Yeah, yeah, although it's pretty cool. The collectibles are cool like they're, you know, you're getting real record label.

Oh yeah, yeah, I remember I remember I wrote the guide for Mafia III at IGN. It was so awkward because I had a like I how was that work with girls tits on my **** TV and I'm like this is the game. So so you doing it of that blanket. So yeah, my that's my conclusion on Mafia III is it's just it's just super half-baked. It could have used way more time, way more design aesthetic and I don't mean that from a graphical standpoint. Technical issues are inexcusable. The AI sucks. The game's not hard which and I like hard games and I just feel like there's a lot of obtuseness to the structure of this quest. There's just nothing is right about the gameplay almost nothing.
