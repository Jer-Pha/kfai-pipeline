All right, topic two, Peer, it is IGN's 20th anniversary. Can you believe it? Look at, look at all the gray, seriously. So I, I want to talk to you about kind of the history of IGN. Like take us through from the beginning all the way through now. Sure. I, me and you guys obviously were, were there for a long time. I, I still on my calendar see like the anniversary dates pop pop up as like 2007 or something, right? Like I think July, July, right? I still see it pop. I'm never going to delete those just like you can never change your PSN name. I'll always no, it's uh, you know, IGN was the idea by uh, of Chris Anderson, who is the uh, the guy",

Chris Anderson uh, founded a Publishing House in the United States, you know, back then he had one in the UK called Future. Started it over here called Imagine Media. And the I and IGN is from Imagine uh, back in the day, which is no longer a parent company. And so he basically said, okay, we're going to, we're going to make these magazines for gamers. And their competitor at the time was Ziff Davis, ironically, now our parent company, right? And so they uh, they basically published all these mags that you probably know like PC Gamer, right? And like um, what was it, PSM, all these magazines over the years. Um, and then at one point in '96, they said, let's, let's try some stuff online.

Everybody Nintendo and all the press release always all caps Nintendo 64. If you wrote N64, they're like, no, it's all caps Nintendo 64. You know how, how they are. And uh, so yeah, we, we got that domain very early on on and then created this website and it had a lot of like Nintendo looking graphics. Like the ratings um, scale was like Mario hats. It was like red Mario hats. So you could totally mistake it for the official site, which is what happened. And then after a while, Nintendo said, uh, that's kind of our brand 'cause we registered it now. And uh, you know, what can we do? But to be fair, they were pretty gracious. Um, Doug Perry, the EIC at the time, went, met with Nintendo. And so they put a plan in place where N64.ign.com, terrible domain, and",

And that was really the beginning of the IGN brand as a standalone. Um, and you know, for a while it was kind of like these different websites, you know, like the N64 website. Uh, Matt and I ran it, Matt Casamassina, and it had its own feel and it was different from, you know, uh, Saturnworld or PSXPower or, you know, which would become IGN PSX. Saturnworld was actually lost in a server mishap. That's how Bush League we were back then. It was gone. It's still on the Wayback Machine. So yeah, and we imported a lot of the content again. But like then we put the IGN brand on everything and and made one homepage, you know, years later, like 1999. I think that same year we took the DEN, an Entertainment Network. If you guys remember Steven Horn, yeah, he was",

If you guys remember Steven Horn, yeah, he was running that. So it was all like Sci-Fi movies, television stuff. And we merged that into IGN. So 1999 is really when we became what we are today, which is lots of gaming, but also we know people don't just play games, they want to know about Game of Thrones, Star Wars, all that stuff. So that's when we became what we are now, I think. Yeah. And then, you know, uh, I don't know how deep you want to go, but like YouTube happened, right? In 1996, there was no YouTube, no Google, no Facebook, no Twitter, no Snapchat, none of that. Um, and so when YouTube happened, well, even, even before YouTube, you guys were doing video. So when did video kind of come into the, oh God, I'm trying to remember. We had like this uh, uh, we had this channel, it was called IGN TV, um, which was Broadband videos, 640x480 QuickTimes at 30 frames per",

Yeah, you couldn't stream them, you had to download them. They were so big. And we had like one guy was just like editing these. So that was pretty early on. Was that Insider? Was that the same as Insider? No, that was IGN TV was free Broadband stuff. So Insider was after the dot-com crash where we all thought we were going to lose our jobs. And so we said, crap, advertisers don't buy ads anymore online because they're going back to TV and magazines. What do we do? And we created Insider, which was um, which was kind of like the more expensive content we create. So videos behind the subscription wall and stuff. So we did more of that stuff then too. But yeah, like I have this full timeline of when we launch what on IGN. It's just crazy. I mean, so many different experiments, things that failed that we stopped",

Podcast Beyond where like Chris Roper and you guys um, started something really special, which was, you know, that wasn't like some corporate like initiative saying like, we really got to get into this podcast market. Like these guys saying, this is awesome, let's do this and trying something. And then you look back years later, you're like, holy shit, it's like a million people listening to this stuff, right? And so I think that's basically our history for the first 10 years was just take stuff and throw it at the wall and see what sticks. And you know, like if you go back and you look at how E3 was covered in 1996 and then look at what we did in 1997, we basically said hourly updates around the clock, which was a novelty back then.",

You know, and that kind of developed how we do things now. Now we're just doing the same thing. Same. Yeah, you refined it a bit though. Yeah, no, like, but, but think about like how IGN changed over the years, right? We only hired writers. They all wrote articles. Our website would update automatically at midnight once a day. If you had a typo, it'll be there for the next 24 hours, right? That's how IGN was in the beginning. And then writers started doing more stuff. Like when we launched the IGN boards in the year 2000, um, suddenly you're like, oh crap, the mic's on. They're all these people. You realized how many people were like reading the stuff. And then editors became social media managers. They're like, oh, every day I got to talk to my audience. And then when we launched videos, some people were really good on",

And we said Damon, and we said, we said, um, or some people were really good at writing incredibly long, awesome articles, right? We said, all right, features, let's do more of that or let's do more of this. And then, you know, people just kind of forged their own paths. And you know, well, that was the funnest thing. I mean, when, when I think look back at my time there, you know, especially because we know I started the 10-year anniversary and we had those horrible cupcakes that then get us put up on. We still have some. That's awesome. Yeah, they in, they in the, the uh, but that was the thing is like you got to go do whatever you wanted to do and you did get to try it and you did get to see it works.

And then Ryan Dunham wanted me to always go into the boards and post it there. Yeah, so people could go and read it and then come there and comment and talk to you and have this conversation about it. And then yeah, spiraling off into videos or like I wanted to go do this feature or let's, let's compare PlayStation Plus and see if it's actually worth it. And like there was no checks and balances to that. It was just like, I have an idea for this, I'm gonna go do this. Yeah, that's what I loved about it was, and I assume it's still kind of run this way, um, is that it, it IGN always benefited the self-starters and the self-starters benefited IGN, I think in return. I think the, I think the reason that IGN PlayStation grew to where it was, for instance, when Greg and I ran it was",

We just did it and it just kind of worked. I heard the podcasts all, all the time. You're like, well, Peer doesn't listen to this. Us, you listen to every podcast. I totally listen. I remember when Casey Lynch was the EIC. This is just a memory I have when and and and he was there late doing something. And Greg and I walked in at like 10 at night on like a Wednesday and he's like, what the hell are you guys doing here? I'm like, it's, they're doing their TGS press conference. What the hell do you think we're doing here? Like we're here to write the news. And he's, and I remember him, I remember him being like, I remember him kind of being mystified almost by it in a way where it's like, wow, you guys really care about this.",

And I'm like, no one told us to do this. We just feel like we need to be here because this is what our audience cares about. And it was a fun way to kind of like cut my teeth, um, like kind of growing with the brand and watching it evolve and having like, I always say like my, my fingerprints are on IGN and they always will be. I think that like that, that's the way it is for a lot of people that have been, that were there for a long time because we were able to mold it this like kind of piece of clay into like exactly what we wanted it to be. And it worked. And then someone takes the piece of clay and molds it in a different way. It's the same shit piece of clay, a legacy. Yeah. And and deep within the clay, like when you look, go to Play-Doh years later, there's people's fingerprints in there. You're like, who",

And I'm like, that's my, those are my fingerprints. Like they're there underneath that other layer. You know, and I, I love that analogy because I think it really does make sense. You're passing that ball of clay off to the next person or whatever. And we, we all, we are learned so much because, you know, in a, in a single kind of, you know, IGN's headquarters are in San Francisco and a lot of the basically the entire games team is in one big area, right? And we have another studio in LA for entertainment, New York, Chicago. But most of editorial is there. And like you guys hear all the stuff other people are doing. And that's, I mean, honestly, I mean, Greg was so impactful when he, he just walked in and he's like, like, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm a gamer, I'm a writer, but I can also do this kind of like this",

I mean, you built a cult at one point. I, I was a little scared. Yeah, I was a little scared. No, but like, and I think it, it rubbed off on everybody. And if you guys go back and you see, uh, if you look at our first video reviews, we actually were sitting there. We're like, okay, we have a decision to make. The people are writing the reviews are awesome reviewers. You put them on camera, they're terrible. Like the way they read their own content didn't sound good. So we're like, all right, should we hire an actor who reads all these uh, reviews? And we got to the point where we said, Brandon Jones. No, yeah, we wanted exactly like GameTrailers did that famously, right? And their reviews sounded so much better than ours for months. But",

And their reviews sounded so much better than ours for months. But over the months, the performance of everyone improved. And they kept on listening to each other and giving each other advice. We had somebody come in, I don't know if you remember that. We had like a voice coach come in. She made strange faces at everybody, right? But it's like now you look back and like people who were once writers are such great performers on camera. It's, it's pretty amazing. Well, I know that's when I always tell people my story, right? And like how I always talk about it. I got there right as the old guard was turning over and burning out certain people or, you know, trying to figure out what they wanted to do. But I was talking about, thanks a lot. No, you know what I mean? But like Craig Harris was always very vocal like, I don't want to be on video. I don't want to read. I'm not doing it. I",

And like that was the thing of you want. I remember there's, there's a distinct video of for GameCube TV where, and it was the first, not even GameCube TV, it was around the office. Ty Root was walking around filming it. It's a video that jumps back and forth between me and Daemon Hatfield and at the very end of it, he puts the camera down and walks down the hallway. And you walk up and you go, oh, putting editors on camera, what a novel idea. 'Cause you had been begging the video team to do it and he was finally doing it. And that's the thing of like, you pointed a camera at Craig and he didn't want it. But you pointed a camera at me and Daemon or Dave",

I, so I, I do think that you, it, it came more naturally to you. And you had the benefit that we had back in the text days. Like when Matt and I did our uh, our Q&As, right? We had Input and Inquiry on IGN 64 where we answered reader letters. And we got this amazing feedback from our audience just via emails. And so you got this encouragement to do it. And like I think you got it instantly where some people tried the hand, weren't that great. And then, I mean, listeners and viewers and readers can be very brutal. You guys know this, right? Yeah.

Like Call of Duty and Battlefield. You've got these fan audiences living in the same space. Like, man, that can be so discouraging. And so I think a lot of writers in the beginning were like, ah, they couldn't handle it, right? They couldn't handle the feedback. But the most important thing to do was to face the feedback and interact with the audience. And you build fans and then they encourage you to do more and really create all that like, get all that creativity out of you. And it's tough, right? It can be soul sucking. You guys know that. It is. I mean, it's, I still always say that I like, you, you read things online. Like I've been doing this for a long time. You read things online that are bad about you. You know, there are",

But it's, it's muddled underneath the, the uh, overt blanket sometimes of negativity. But you have to just delve deeper and you learn that that's not when you like, it's a superficial judgment too, right? Like you for a second, you're like, oh man, maybe that guy knows me in some way.

Yeah, I was on somebody's couch. I was involved with, I was involved with IGN in like a full and basically a full capacity for 10 years of my life since I was 18. I, I was actually um, I had actually just turned 18 when Steven Horn reached out to me about my stuff on GameFAQs and was like, can we use on IGN FAQs? And I was like, sure.

I had written for some fan sites. And I wrote for GameFAQs, roll time. I was a prolific writer there. But it could have been anyone. Like any one of us. There was probably 50 of us there that like, we really like always on the message boards talking to each other about our guides and stuff like that. And it just, it just was randomly me, right? There were better writers there. There were like more prolific writers there. And I think back at that time and I'm like, I always explain it as like someone just cracked the door open. And I'm like, I'm kicking this shit down. You",

But like to prove myself to IGN, I got freelance opportunities from other people. And I'm like, no, yeah, like, like I'm like, I'm writing only for IGN. I remember a magazine in the UK approaching me about Zelda, uh, um, when they released The Link to the Past on Game Boy Advance. And they're like, we'll pay you $1,500 to write like two pages. Why didn't you do that? You know? And and I'm like, and I had to do all the I because I had to jump through a few hoops, whatever. But I'm like, I was so involved.
