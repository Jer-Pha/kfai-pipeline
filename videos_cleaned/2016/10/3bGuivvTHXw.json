Where's the consensus? I think it's awesome. Colin, do you like it? Yeah, I don't know that it's awesome, awesome in my opinion, but I think it's a great game. I mean, for me, exactly what I wanted. It's we talk about this all the time, games not delivering on your expectations for them, right? Uh, from the time I we first heard about Dragon Quest Builders and it was going to be some weird RPG mashup with Minecraft, I was like, and it's going to be on Vita. I was like, this sounds like the perfect game to have on mute and watch TV with and fool around with and build something out and and it's done that to a T for me, right?

I have Batman: Arkham Asylum. I want to play more that. I want to play more Tomb Raider. I want to do more VR stuff. But I'm like, I could also kick on Luke Cage or West Wing or something like there and just sit here and chill out and go through and grind out and find find new materials and find new recipes and do all these different things. It's it's on Vita accomplishing exactly what I want, you know what I mean? And it's interesting to see so many people excited for it on PS4, on PS3, enjoying it on a console. When for me, it is that experience, but it is a Vita game, which obviously I'm always excited about. It's a Vita game that runs well. It's a Vita game that's",

And what I've talked about in the other shows from, yeah, somebody who's played hours and hours of Minecraft, right, is the fact that it's a dumbed down Minecraft. You know what I mean? Like it is Baby's First Minecraft. In the same way, it's Baby's First RPG or whatever, right? Of was like, okay, take this Quest and run and do this. There's problems with both those things. Whereas the RPG side, which we'll touch on with Colin, I know more is just like, it sucks that there's not a quest log. It sucks that I can't see everything on there and have a better tracking system. But again, it's so simple, why does that matter? I'm at most having two, three quests at a time.

The Minecraft side of it is it's doing away with so many things that aren't annoyances in Minecraft. They are Minecraft, that's the game. But here you don't have to worry about it where, you know, in the very beginning, you start with just these, you know, empty boxes on the bottom of your screen, which you're filling with the materials you're collecting or whatever you're doing. But then, you know, you build your own chest. I was like, okay, great, I'm building these chests. I'll be able to put this stuff in there. Like Minecraft, if I put two chests together, they'll become one big chest. Okay, no, they don't do that. There's still many chests. But when I go to craft, I don't need to take out of the chest what I want at the crafting station. It knows that back in that chest, I have a whole bunch of sand, so I can make some glass.

Okay, that's really cool, easy, taking away some of the challenge of like trying to figure out where you're putting all your resources. Then you make like an enchanted chest that when you're out there and you fill up your bar, that stuff's just automatically transitioned back. And if you have stuff back there that you've already crafted, you can hit X at any time in the open world and then pull up your menu and take stuff out of that enchanted chest and have it ready to go. It's a cheat, it's an easy way around it. But for what they're doing, the kind of game they're building, what they want to be, it works. Um, I wish they went deeper with it, right? Like, uh, just finished Chapter 1 or whatever, which is the first, uh, area. And then you jump out and you know, Colin and I talked a little bit of, we touched on this in PS I Love You XOXO, and the fact that I was getting ready to",

So I stopped because I wanted to run around and get the challenges done that you had to find online to find out what the challenges were. It turns out that when you, it's cumbersome, when you leave that chapter and start the next chapter, you can always load your previous save and go back into that other chapter you were in to complete the rest of the challenges, which you can now see. But in the other, now it's a completely different save for the next one. So you're starting over in these little mini worlds where in a Minecraft, you know, I want to build out this my universe, my world.

You can increase your health bar, but it's your your town level that you're going with. You I, you know, I focused on it for a while thinking like, put my quest aside, I'm going to build this place out, make more rooms. You're getting like XP off of the rooms, which then fill in your town level meter. I hit level five real quick and that was the max level. I was like, oh, okay, well, I'm going to keep playing through the story and the next, you know, I'll get to some tipping point where my town can level up more. No, you know, for the first one, level five is as far as it can go. I don't know what level Chapter 2 is, because I've been playing this game wrong.

That's not how this works. Now that I understand that, it's like, oh, okay. And like I was all hesitant to go jump out and not do the challenges. That was silly because I could have jumped to the next world and then come back to the save and gone back for those challenges there. But I'm enjoying it. It's doing what I wanted to do. Combat's super simple. Uh, the Minecraft element is super simple, but it's all enjoyable. It's all enjoyable junk food gameplay where I'm just going through and it's got those hooks of, well, I'm almost there. All right, I did this Quest. Well, there's a exclamation mark above her head.

And to see how that all goes, it's interesting. And I'm interested now, having, you know, gone through the first world, I'm really interested to see what happens with the next world. Colin, uh, I think that, uh, I think what stops the game from being like fantastic is is its peculiarity. It's the peculiar kind of things that it does that I don't think make any sense. Uh, but I also think those are minor, minor, uh, issues in a game that I think is undeniably fun. I don't have, I don't really like Minecraft and I think that the, I wouldn't play this if it wasn't a Dragon Quest game. Um, it's the same way I feel about Omega Force's Musou that came out last",

And so, um, you know, I'm a really big fan of those core games and some of the great role-playing games of all time. If you're into really traditional, grindy role-playing games that don't have much story, um, or story that really matters. It's not, you know, I don't recommend Dragon Quest for everyone. It's not not Final Fantasy. Um, and that's good and that's that's bad. Um, so getting into the game immediately and that's why I'm so interested in Greg's experience and why Greg and I have been talking about it a lot is Greg doesn't know anything about Dragon Quest and I don't really know anything about Minecraft. So I don't see the comparisons to Minecraft like saying it's like simpler than Minecraft. I'm like, I don't",

I don't have the kind of nuanced understanding of Minecraft to know that it's different in any respect. But what really hit me over the head, which I think Greg doesn't see, and that's why I think our opinions together are really powerful, um, with this is that like the fan service in the game is really like over the top and I like it. Um, the music, then the score of the soundtrack is awesome. The sound effects are awesome. All the enemies you're fighting are Dragon Quest enemies. The weapons and the items that you're finding, uh, like the Oak, the Oaken Club and all these, these are all weapons from the games. The armor, all armor from the games. Um, the items that you're making, a lot of them are items from the games. Um, and I think, uh, it's a, um, I really like that",

Um, and I think, uh, it's a, um, I really like that Square Enix has worked to democratize Dragon Quest in a different way. It's not to say there has been Dragon Quest spin-offs, there have been Dragon Quest spin-offs for 15 years. Um, it's just to say that like with Heroes and with, um, going into the Musou direction and then with, uh, uh, this particular game going into more the Minecraft direction. I really like that they're opening it more to a non-niche audience. In fact, trying to get more people to play Dragon Quest in order to figure out what Dragon Quest is to get back kind of burrow back into what drag like the essence Dragon Quest, which is not Dragon Quest Heroes, which is not Dragon Quest Builders, um, but is more of a 60, 70, 80, 100 hour grindy as **** role-playing game.

I think I would enjoy it even more if there was a quest log, if there if the challenges weren't so vague and like I don't understand the the reasons why in a game that has such significant localization and a lot of translation in the game that they didn't just go the extra step in the original game to make a quest log to. And that was really weird. That's I was telling Greg is like Dragon Quest IX was the last Dragon Quest core game that came out in the States. And that game came out on on DS and uh, or 3DS, I guess. No, it was DS and IX. Yeah, yeah, DS. Um, and uh, I I felt like I was telling Greg, I'm like, that game was so side quest heavy that there were literally, there are hundreds of them and the game numbered them like like you go into your log and be",

And then you see in your list like, I don't even know where 38 is. I don't know where 39 is. This is side quest 40. And then and so in this game, I'm like, where's the where's the there's so much heritage here. There's such a legacy in a bunch of through lines to real Dragon Quest. But you don't tell me what the **** I have to do. Like you don't. And I found I was I've been reading a lot about the game too, um, hoping that there was some information from the Japanese version. In Japan, it was on PS4, PS3, and Vita. So a lot of people played it over there. And um, I I was like looking for information and reading about things.

But like, I'd be **** pissed if I spent 10 hours at this place making this thing and they're like, it doesn't really matter. For me, the problem is it's not I'm not mad at it. I just wish I would have looked into it more in the beginning because I would have played the game differently now. No, I because it's it's a platinum, right? This is a game I'm enjoying. I'd like to platinum. I'm going to play it on planes, right? But now when I take off tomorrow and I really get into Chapter 2, right?

Then it turns out at the end, there's a challenge for beating it in 0 days, right? And it's like, oh, all right, cool. The next time I play, it's going to be what's your mission? All right, great. What's your mission? All right, great. Oh, I got to get this to whatever level it needs to be. I've hit the base for that level. Great. What's your next? Because it was before where I'm playing, you know, and I'm I built an awesome base. I'm really proud of it. I've enjoyed it.

I mean, that's that's basically the essence of a role-playing game. That's the essence of a lot of games. And Dragon Quest was always really good at it. So when games came along in the genre, in the role-playing game genre, like Lunar or something like that, where the enemy scaled and all stuff, it kind of frustrated the **** out of me because I was like, well, what's the point of even leveling then, you know? And it's the it's I got a similar feeling here, which is unfortunate because Dragon Quest isn't about this where I'm like, well, and the game makes it really clear in this respect where it's like, your character is not going",

Uh, you have to find new things to craft, new items and armor that make him stronger, right? That that makes sense. But since it's not carrying over from chapter to chapter, I'm way less excited about like the prospect of spending a ton of time with this game since I just don't feel like it really matters, you know? Like and that's I feel like this game's doing did so well in Japan and is doing so well here, it seems like critically that we'll probably get another one that I hope that they they burrow down into that and and and do, um, fix that problem because I do think that that's weird.

And each like at maximum, what there's like four in Chapter 1, like four active people in that town who are talking to you to give you things. So once I get one Quest from them, I could have four any time and they're just above their heads. And it's not the exact same thing.

I wish it was what we thought it was going to be. But now knowing it, it's just like, I the Quest for the dragons, how would you know that? You know that when you beat the chapter, which is why for Chapter 2, I'm **** beating it as fast as possible. And then those challenges, those challenges will open up. And I'm like, all right, cool. If I didn't get the thing, I'll go back and get those things. Yeah, I suspect that, um, well, let me let me back up. You said that we're playing the game wrong. I I hate that particular excuse. We've talked about this in the past. If a game lets you play it in a certain way, then you're not playing the game wrong. It's on it's actually on. It's not like playing Mario and just running into enemies and yeah, you're clearly playing the game wrong, right?

The game lets me play it exactly like that. If I was playing and what we were talking about there was that like, I was like, there's just too much **** to do in this game, way too many quests, way too many question marks. He's like, well, you're playing it wrong. I'm like, how how how am I playing it wrong? The game literally lets me play it like this. And I played it like this for 60 hours. So clearly that's not true, right? And so so with with Dragon Quest, I like with Dragon Quest Builders specifically, I feel like it's just one of those issues. What Kevin is asleep? Literally no. Yeah, well, the door the doorbell rang. You didn't move at all. Not even like a not even a look over there. Pass out. So I feel like a Dragon Quest Builders specifically, it's",
