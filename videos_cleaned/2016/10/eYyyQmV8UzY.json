You're suddenly watching hockey. That's interesting. I was at a bar, uh, but I didn't go to the bar like, man, I can't wait to see what the Canadiens are up to. Your tweet specifically said you were watching the Habs game. You spell Canadiens with an A, by the way. I'm going to let that go. But yeah, but the uh, is that not how the team spells it? It's Canadiens. Like that's how the team spells it. I was right. If I was talking about multiple Canadians though, right? Just making sure. I'm just making sure I didn't screw overall.

So it's exciting kind of. Oh, always. This is the most kind of time. You know, DL, everybody sharpening their skates. Everyone sharpening their skates. They sharpen their own skates in the, they take their stick and they bend it just a little bit at the top. Get the little cage going on there. That's already done. But uh, you can't have an illegal bend in your stick. So, you know what I mean? Like there is a lot of gray area in hockey in the rules. I think you'll admit as I, we've brought up many a time, icing. No one really knows what it is. So that's only called maybe 50 to 75% of it.

I watch the Jets have a really ferocious front seven and I'm watching players literally get tackled by offensive line and just not, no call. It's like, come on, man. Yeah, you, yeah, yeah. It's another, it's another podcast probably, but it's never stopped us before. Jets, man. Colin, it does me well to see you. I haven't seen you in quite some time. Has been that long. But yeah, it's good to see. It feels like it's been a long time. How much Dragon Quest Builders have you played? None. I mean, I've had it for several weeks. God, Colin, it's getting great reviews.

Hey, I didn't say, I don't say you don't see me wearing the Dragon Quest shirt saying I've been around. I've been around. I've deserve this. But it is the mashup of what I've always known to be Dragon Quest with Minecraft. So it's a dumbed down Minecraft and a dumbed down Dragon Quest and it's perfect fun. You jump in there.

But this Notch guy, they think has good ideas and it might go somewhere. Uh, but they took what I liked about Minecraft and like I said, dumbed it down, made it easier in a way. You know what I mean? Cause before it was, you needed to have, you know, I need to build this thing. I need to make this recipe, craft this thing as they say. I got to go to my, oh wait, where did I put this thing? Crap.

Um, but it's weird to play it and have the RPG mixed in with it and have it be this, you know, open world is how they describe it as. And of course, it's very basic. You know what I mean? You have two, so far, I'm what, five and a half hours in maybe, and I've have like, you know, the most I've ever had is like two or three quests going at one time. No quest log, which I hate. I hate not being able to jump in and see what I've done. Instead, I got to like talk to the people in my little town or go look at this thing. Yeah, weird.

You can figure out like some sort of way when you're in your, when you're in your town, the people who have requested it will still have that above their head and you can go talk to them any time and they'll remind you what they need. Sloppy. Yeah, it's sloppy. But it's one of those things that again, I think for this kiddie-fied RPG, this kiddie-fied open-world RPG, it's fine. And the fact that it's fine is good enough for me for a Vita game that I want to play on the go. And I'm surprised at how well it runs. I thought for sure it's another one of these PlayStation 4 games that's also getting a Vita version. Vita version will run like ****. It does not. It runs well. So far, five and a half hours.

So having it constantly in third person can be a hassle. There's different little things I've gone into and had conversations where I'm just looking at the back of the building I'm in. Can't see what's happening inside. Dragon Quest in third person makes sense. So yeah, no, no, that's the thing. It's the mixup of what I expected from Dragon Quest and then this fun Minecraft or whatever. But I love it on the Vita. It's ready to go. It's sucking at the time.

Now what the **** am I going to do? You know what I mean? Now actually having like the carrot at the end of the stick, getting different costumes, having a bunch of annoying **** who want me to build them their own personal rooms, which I think is a bit much.

It's the first, I mean, and I'm not racking my brain too hard here, but it's the first Vita game to deliver in a while of exactly the experience I wanted from it. If that makes sense. You know what I mean? Like it's one of those where this is exactly what I thought this game was going to be and now I'm totally addicted and can't wait to play more of it.

That's annoying. That's annoying. But I understand Mike B has talked about it before. Had to, he has to do what he got to do. Yeah, you got to do what you got to do. Yeah, that's fine. So if you're not playing Dragon Quest, what have you been playing? I've been playing a lot of games. Uh, so I mean, paramount amongst them is Mafia III, which I'm, I've probably baited breath for, probably played about between 10 and 15 hours of the game. Um, so that's probably one of the games I played the most this entire year, uh, in terms of hours. Sure. You've been looking for almost any game.

I think that the consensus amongst some of the things I've seen people kind of chattering about it is it's just disappointing. Like the, the um, the storyline and the performances in Mafia III are fantastic and they are not equivalent to everything else in the game. So like they have this really, really great main character in Lincoln Clay, a black Vietnam vet, 1968 New Bordeaux. It's a New Orleans kind of uh, facsimile. Um, he's, I'm going to spoil the first couple hours of this of the thing.

So you can mute until you see the second head tap. If you're in a car driving, **** you. You should have watched on YouTube. So Lincoln Clay has this surrogate father named um, Sammy, who own runs this club and it's kind of like a low-level like gangster. Can I make an educated guess right, right off the bat? Is Sammy played by Dave Fenoy? Cause somebody texted or tweeted me saying I can't figure that **** out. What I, he Dave by be in this game. What up, Dave? Uh, so uh, and Sammy has a son, another son named Ellis. Whatever. Anyway, they all kind. Lincoln comes back. He's basically like uh, like a pretty well respected soldier in Vietnam.

Not really the Italian mob, but the high, the high ranking like Southern mob, whatever. And um, push comes to shove, they kill Ellis, they kill Sammy, which I didn't expect because you're kind of getting close to these characters in the first couple hours. And maybe people knew that, but I've been, I've not been paying attention to this at all. Uh, once I knew it was basic, what, what the story was about, I'm like, I'm good. Uh, I didn't want to have anything spoiled for me. And uh, so it opens up this like, this story of revenge, which is awesome. So like, uh, it's all about getting to this guy, Marcanos, who's like the high-level mobster. Underneath him are a bunch of capos. And then like three capos. And then underneath them",

You pick off two lieutenants, you get to the capo that's underne, like above them and stuff like that. Um, and it's a nice little organized story of, of revenge. Like he doesn't really have any other goal than to **** these guys up as much as possible to hurt them as much as they, he's hurt him like through killing these people, whatever. And so I like the story. He works with like pretty closely with the CIA agent and that like worked with him in Vietnam and such. There's like a lot of great characters.

Like, like the real quick, are we done with story spoilers? Yes. So the uh, thank you. The uh, the gunplay's fine, right? The uh, driving is fine. Uh, it's just that there's like a bunch of technical issues. Game's boring. And so lighting's all ****ed up in the game. Anyone who's played it, like it's totally ****ed botch. Okay. I don't know how I've never seen a game with lighting that's ****ed up in my life. The sun comes out, suddenly you're blinded. The sun goes down, you can't **** see anything.

Like whenever you commit a crime, whenever you break into a car, almost always someone's reporting you to the cops. And then they run to the phone and they call the cops and you just drive away.

There's no fast travel in the game or something. Yeah, there's no fast travel. And the game, the game is pretty huge. Like you go into the Bayou a lot. See, this is what's cool about the game is a lot of the crime takes place in the Bayou. Like they're running drugs from Haiti and from Cuba. Like smuggling things from Cuba. They're, they're like, they have, um, there's like a whole racket of people that are like use chemicals to like get rid of bodies and ****. There's like a whole like a lot of cool things in the game.

In that time, you should be able to log in to any other PlayStation 4, download those games and play them as long as you're connected to online.
