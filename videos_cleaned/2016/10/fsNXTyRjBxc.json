Spoilers, that's a whole trailer. I just want everyone to know, but it's still a trailer, but it's this is a teaser. That's true by definition. That's true. We haven't seen anything. I am tickled. Absolutely. We're not seeing Doomsday. You know, this ain't none of that. This is a teaser, and I appreciate that. Now, are we going to get completely spoiled once we see the actual trailers? Absolutely. Are we gonna see Zordon? Are we gonna see Alpha 5? Are we gonna see the Zords? Are we going to see them act? Are we going to hear \"It's Morphin Time\"? Yeah, we're going to see all of that sh*t in the trailer. I hope not, but we're going to, we're going to. That's how you have to. You can't a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger movie without actually showing the Power Rangers. Yes, so this has been a long time coming. We've seen many, many images.

It was kind of like then we saw the posters with the Zords, and it's like, all right. And then, then they started announcing some casting, and we're like, all right, we're getting Bryan Cranston as Zordon, and it's like, yes. Then we're getting, uh, what's his name? Kev, Bill Hader as Alpha 5, right? Yes. Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa. Yes. So a lot of the supporting cast, um, I was really into, really into this idea. Now, it's Power Rangers. Yeah, so is this going to be a great movie? Mhm. No. No. Okay, the answer is no. The answer is no. I don't think it's going to be a great movie, but I've had, I'm, you guys know I love Power Rangers, huge, huge Power Rangers fans.

So the idea that they are making a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie with Jason and Zack and Trini and Kimberly, Billy, that's exciting to me. My, my prediction of where this movie is going to lie, I think it's going to be fun. I think it's definitely going to be just a Power Rangers movie in every sense of the word, but I think it's going to land squarely somewhere between, um, like the fourth Karate Kid movie, you know what I mean? Like, and, and The Next Karate Kid movie, you know what I mean? Like, somewhere in that area, I think is where we're shooting for as far as quality and like, and like, uh, impact is concerned. So my thing with this is, you know, we, we have now rebooted pretty much every franchise imaginable from the late 80s, early 90s in terms of kids cartoons or, uh, Saturday morning shows like, like this. So we've seen Ninja Turtles, we've seen Transformers, we've seen a lot of",

So we've seen Ninja Turtles, we've seen Transformers, we've seen a lot of that stuff. A lot of the, the concerns I had or have about Power Rangers is that it is just going to be a Power Rangers movie, and I think that they are doing a good job of separating it because Power Rangers is a franchise that never stopped. So, uh, every year there's been a season with a whole new group of Power Rangers, uh, coming through after the first seven seasons, and every time was different Rangers. But with whereas Transformers and Ninja Turtles have been around for years, and every time that there's a new show, it's still Leonardo and Raphael and Donatello, still Optimus Prime and Megatron. Power Rangers is, it's constantly just different, right? So the fact that we're going back to Mighty Morphin, and the fact that they are, it's the tone.

This is not that. I still, I mean, obviously they're going for much more of a Chronicle vibe with this, which I think a lot, I saw a lot of, uh, not criticism, but a lot of people saying that, yeah, this reminds them of Chronicle, and especially this scene, we not right here where they have to kind of discover their powers and test their powers, right? Um, but I feel like this captures the spirit of Power Rangers, um, while still bringing it into the 21st century. It's still about a group of kids. It's still about them discovering powers. It's an origin story. This is an origin story, which is great. Um, it's going to be fun to watch them come together and fight Rita Repulsa. Um, there's, it's going to be",

I'm hoping we get some cheese because I'm not seeing too much cheese here. Like this, the, the Rita Repulsa scene is like, man, this is the Power Ranger movie that like, I just, that scene at least is the Power Ranger movie that I wish that they would make. So I'm, I'm pretty excited about that. But you're right, it's Chronicle meets Breakfast Club. Is that a bad thing? No, not necessarily. I think it could be really fun. I think again, this is a, this is obviously not going to be a hard R, uh, rating. It's going to be probably PG, PG-13, I would imagine. Probably it's definitely not R, but you know, we've got, I think it's going to be a fun film. I think it's going to",

It's going to be a, a cool, uh, uh, world to see these characters playing in. It's to me, I think probably right where it needs to be, which is somewhere in between the original series and that amazing Power Ranger short that happened, uh, that Adi Shankar put out a long time ago. Um, that was way too dark, and no one wants to see that. I would love to see that. Everyone wants to see that. I would love to see that dark, but you can't do a movie that dark with, with the Power Rangers franchise. Just Saban's not going to let that happen. Uh, but I think this is going to be, and honestly, you know what it reminds me of a little bit? Um, I made the comparison to Karate Kid. I should have made the comparison to like, it's, it's actually between Sky High and, and the Hilary Swank Karate Kid.",

There's going to be moments that are probably going to actually be very enjoyable for me. I will actually see this, um, because I'm fascinated to see what they do with it. Um, the question then becomes when they make the, the inevitable, you know, Power Rangers 3, 4, and 5, where they go with the series. But let's not get too far ahead of ourselves on that one. We can only hope Tommy needs to make an appearance. So the thing, there's a lot, a lot to break down in this trailer for me as a fan. So the, the Chronicle and kind of, um, Breakfast Club vibes that we're getting from this, I think are good in the sense that it's, I would rather that than Twilight.

There was a big worry that this movie was going a little bit of a Twilight, but I not immediately when you watch it, you think Chronicle, not Twilight, which I think that is a good step in the right direction. Um, there, there's a lot of things here like the, this scene right here is very reminiscent of the how they got their powers in Zordon, which I like. There's a lot of, lot of subtle little nods to like the Power Rangers mythology that has been, uh, you know, kind of growing over the last 20 years. Mhm. Um, but I, I like that we're getting at least some character development because if you think back to the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, there wasn't an origin story. Their origin story was that they got teleported from Zordon into the thing, and they're now Power Rangers. Yeah, do. So it's like, that's this, the god, at least give some type of real reason for this thing happening, or else we just get the 1995 Power Rangers",

You have to bring in new audiences with this, and you can't, I don't think that you could put out that, that level of cheese and get modern day, you know, tween right now, which I think is the audience proba they're probably going for with this. Exactly. And I think that, uh, you know, so far at least, like this trailer has millions and millions and millions of views, of course. Uh, and it, but, but it's like kind of shocking, uh, and it is getting the type of views that like Marvel movies get or like big, big time things, and Power Rangers scene is kind of",

Uh, yeah, I mean, I, I would imagine it's not quite, quite as popular as like some like the X-Men or Avengers. Um, but I mean, that you have to admit, it's a great move for them. Like, say Power Rangers to anyone that any one of your friends, they know it. Yeah, they might not be huge fans of it, but everyone knows the, the Power Rangers. So the, the biggest kind of issue with this trailer as a Power Ranger fan that everyone's talking about is, is that they have powers as civilians now. In the, in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, they did not. Um, they, they were able to kind of fight the Putties every once in a while, but then they would have to morph and, uh, to continue fighting. I'm not against it really. I think that, I think that it adds, it gives levels to they can fight, they have powers civilians, then there's the morph level.",

It kind of just raises the stakes of, of what they're doing and allows to have different kind of fight scenes and stuff. This looks, the CG looks horrible. Yeah, this shot particular bad. Um, you know, I mean, maybe this is, who knows, they may have, they may fix that a little bit. It might be just a cut for the trailer. I doubt it though. This stuff looks great though. I mean, there, there, there's beautiful cinematography in this. This is actually my one concern when, you know, kind of when, when, and I think this is the biggest, uh, uh, sort of thing they got to fight against is that it's so synonymous with cheesiness. It's so synonymous with that, you know, uh, uh, deep depth of field sort of like TVs, you know, obviously I'm in a, I'm a human being in a, you know, like Godzilla style cho around city that",

This looks like a film. This looks like a film that they put a lot of money into. It looks like a film that they're, they're investing in because they want to make this a franchise. Obviously that stuff looks great. You know, that looks so. Okay, Kev, this is going to be a little difficult, but I kind of want to go not frame by frame, but section by section through the trailer. So we'll just skip along starting from the beginning. Does that work? So obviously here you can pause it. Um, go back. You can see that the, you get the color, the Power Rangers. So that's great. Skip forward a little bit more, Kev. So pause there. Oh, not here. A little bit more. My screw up. Pause. So if you look on the back window of his car, Kinda Funny sticker. No, it's a White Tiger.

It is a red Ford Ranger. It looks like you go there. You go. So we got Jason here. You can go forward, Kev. Um, it's so weird to see things like there's, there's signs that say Angel Grove, and I'm like, man, like, like right there, they really did take the original world and kind of like flush it out little out. We're seeing Jason with his dad. So these characters are actually like, there's some layers to them, which is interesting. We got Zack, the Black Ranger. Pause me back there, Kev. Go back one frame.

I don't think you're supposed to see those for a reason. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, anyway, that's Billy. So, Kev, go back to the bully. Yeah, so in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, there was Bulk and Skull, who were the, the two bullies who he is, I don't know, like, he might be kind of a both of them in one. Sure. Uh, but I don't know, we, we'll have to, to find out. I would hope that they, they're both in the movie, but they also those are characters that don't necessarily fit in this world, right?",

Uh, 'cause they were the most over the top part of Power Rangers, which is kind of hard to believe. Um, that's saying something. All right, cool. Go through. So we got Trini, the Yellow Ranger, Kimberly, the Pink Ranger, looking good. So pause again, again. So what I like about all this is these are, they're all the characters are loners. Yeah, right? All of them have their own issues where they're, they're being either all of them are being bullied essentially, whether it's by their dad or their, uh, their ACC. So it's like, I like that it, it's giving them a reason to, to, to join together and have friends and stuff. So very cool. Keep going forward. There, there's the Power Coins, which is what they use to morph. Yeah, but they're usually like, uh, so usually they're actual coins that go into the Morphers. I don't know. I have a",

How do you think they got exposed? Billy, he does science stuff. He does machines. How did Donatello get explosives? Who knows? They're in the sewer, found them probably. So it really makes me wonder how if this is all from like the first third of the movie, like how much of the suits are we actually going to get in this? Is it just going to be like the Final Act? Probably. I, I would imagine you get to the midpoint right when Rita Repulsa has done something horrible, and then they're like, well, we got to take it to the next level, and you get the suits.

So this is the most Power Ranger shot in the entire thing. Did you see them what? Practicing karate? I don't even really know. Practicing Taekwondo. Man, it's, you know what they do, but they both, I got your back. I mean, I assume they're fighting someone that the Putties are coming or someone's coming, and they have to actually fight for the first time. I think that this is them maybe practicing. What's the dude, this dude on the train though? What's he doing? Green Ranger? Is that the Green Ranger? I, I think it's the Black Ranger. Do you think that any of this movie is going to make any sense? This is the most important thing. Go to the kiss. Go to the kiss, Kevin. The kiss that before right there.

And Zeo, she ends up getting with, she leaves him, and he ends up getting with, with Kat, the second Pink Ranger. 'Cause he's a little Pink Ranger out there. God damn it, Tommy, you need to stop. You need to be stopped. There's like a, a Flash Forward where like a 100 years in the future, Tommy and Kat have kids. That's not my C. I don't believe that. Read to me like, hey, we had a tough day. Maybe we should kiss each other as friends. Totally platonic. Just platonic. Now, what I'm hoping is this leads into some dynamic between the eventual Tommy and Jason. I'm sure it will.

We saw it unfortunately unfold terribly in Batman v Superman, even though not here. But so, so if you're going to put that character in, he's going to unfortunately shoehorn into the story. We can only hope that like, we, there's, there's no, I mean, there already is nods to him in this, but nods really to Tommy as a character, uh, and then that he later comes in maybe like a post-credit scene or whatever. Keep going, Kev. So pause it there. So that's Elizabeth Banks as a horrifying Rita Repulsa. We've seen her super before. It's very green.

I would also assume that Zordon was probably a Ranger himself before, and that they have history, and there's going to be a lot of sh*t tied in there. Awesome. I'm excited about it. Uh, in the original Power Rangers, um, series, Rita created the Green Power Coin, which then made Tommy the Green Ranger. So Rita being like the source of the Green Ranger's Power makes sense, and I think that this is kind of a modernization of that. So that could be pretty cool. She violently throws Trini here. Boom. Backwards lightning bolt. I don't like that at all. So we get the, uh, Command Center, which is dope. And then we see the morph. Go, go back and a little bit to the Yellow Ranger.
