Oh yeah, Sonic is back the right way. I'm very, very, very excited about this. What are we going to be doing today? Uh, we're going to be playing uh the new zones. Uh, we have Studiopolis and Mirage Saloon. Um, and we also have uh the playable characters available today. So besides Sonic, we have Tails and Knuckles. So if you want to, you want to show Tails? Should I or should I start with Sonic or should I go? Let's go right in the Tails. Yeah, go over it. Uh, so let's uh so Mirage Saloon, you want to pick uh two? We're going to play Act 2 of Mirage Saloon. Uh, to change Tails, just press square right there. There we go. There you go. There's a little headphones on. It's adorable. All right, we're going in. I like how that looks like the old school debug menu from Sonic sound. Yeah, yeah, it's great. Oh wow, this is awesome. So for those of you that",

So for those of you that don't know, I'm a really big old school Sonic fan, so this is very exciting to me that we're finally getting another 2D Sonic game done correctly with the Sprites and stuff. You know, not trying to throw any shade anywhere, but it's been a while since Sonic CD. So uh for Tails, uh you can uh fly. So if you tap on the X but right there a lot, you just oh yeah, okay, there we go. You can you can get to, you know, places that you know Sonic might not be able to reach. Some always been a big fan of his name being Miles \"Tails\" Prower, which sounds like miles per hour. It's fantastic. Yeah, he's so adorable. So can you switch characters like during the thing or is it only between levels? You you have to do it when you select the level. So this seems like I can just kind of fly over a lot of things.

His AI isn't exactly oh yeah, if you are playing a two-player, you can play with, you know, like you have a little brother and he wants to play with you, like he can play as Tails and uh just like in Sonic 3, you can carry Sonic. Oh, it's the boys. It's those dudes. Yeah, so tell me a little bit about the the back of this game. I know that it is like, what did the Taxman tell us? The story of the Taxman. Everybody wants to know about Taxman. So Christian Whitehead is our main programmer and designer for Sonic Mania. And oh, oh yeah, he he he going to get you. He going get me. He going to get you.

Um, and you know, uh he's working with uh PagodaWest and also Headcannon Simon Thomley. Um, and uh we have a very passionate Sonic team right now with Sonic Mania. You know, cool. Our our team is always talking about how uh how Sonic is such a big part of their lives and you know, obviously Christian one of them. And uh they actually gave us a pitch about, you know, what if uh Sega still created, you know, this Classic Sonic game well into Sega Saturn? And you know, so it started from there. So you know, you can see Sonic Mania is uh, you know, it's HD resolution, 60 frames per second. Um, and a lot of people been, you know, very excited to tell me me that, you know, it's it's feels like a Sonic game. It, you know, it looks like a Sonic game. And you know, it it's it",

And well, I mean, that's the coolest thing is, I mean, there's a lot of history there where like you're talking about with the mobile games. Like a lot of people like to hate on mobile games, but those are some of the few where it's like, I think that those the ports of uh Sonic 1, Sonic 2, and Sonic CD are the superior versions of the games. They made it so it was widescreen. They made it so it is an updated version. And it, you know, there's a lot of uh updates in it that plays the game, makes the game play really well. You got yeah, there we go. So cute. So that's a cool stage. So yeah, the music is something that really stands out to me.

I mean, Sonic to me has always been really about kind of the the soundtracks and just like that it has a very distinct feel. This sounds similar to it, but in kind of a more updated version. Who's working on the music for this? So our composer for Sonic Mania is Tee Lopes, and he's doing all of our tracks, including the remastered uh zone. So uh, you know, um from the people who's heard Green Hill in Studiopolis and uh Mirage Saloon, he's done all of it. And he, you know, it I can't wait to show everybody what his music is. It's really great. It's, you know, I I just got to say that it's just that um nostalgic. Yeah, yeah. So the other thing that we should mentioned earlier is that there's a CRT filter on this to make it kind of feel more genuine and authentic to how the games used to look. But there's a couple other filters as well. So you can play without that. So it looks even more clean and uh HD presented and all that stuff. Yeah, it's just",

It kind of uh fills in the nostalgia. So I'm going to do is I'm going to go Knuckles. We'll play Studiopolis Act 1 and then I'll go Sonic for Studiopolis. Does that work? Oh, actually, it's only Studiopolis Act 1. Okay, cool. Then H I'll go Knuckles and I can replay a level with Sonic. Sure. There you go. Cause I want to get my boy Sonic out there. I've always been a pretty pure Sonic guy when it comes to this stuff. So Knuckles can uh fly and also climb. Um, some in some of the zones, you know, there's walls that he can just run through and break them. Uh-huh. So one of the new mechanics in the game is the the Drop Dash.

Yeah, uh the, you know, the levels are pretty hefty actually. It's vertically very uh filled out. Um, you know, some people might feel that it's a little long, but you know, Sonic Mania uh is overall trying to recreate what, you know, most people felt with like Sonic 3. Mhm. So I think it's a good size. And you know, we're trying to make a a a multi-level uh level design. So you could go up the on the high route or in the mid route. Um, what's great about it is that, you know, even if you kind of like miss the jump, you can kind of still keep continuing forward. You probably just yeah, oh God, yeah, the animations are so good.

Oh yeah, so if he's like leaning forward or leaning, what you even hit me? The film. The film's going to get you. Film always gets me. Oh, there you go. That's awesome. Yeah, the animation in this is so cute. It's awesome. Yeah, but uh it's not just the main characters. Uh actually, the enemies uh have an updated animation even for some of the uh familiar enemies like um these are all new enemies, but you know, like the Moto Bug or something. Well, earlier in the last level we played, I saw the I don't know the name of it, but that like the the caterpillar thing. Yeah, what's his name? Cat is think Caterkiller. The Caterkiller. Why not?

That that oh God, this little dude shbg is just getting you sp just CL you're right. See, so okay, so we we've been playing the two new levels so far. But earlier in other builds stuff, we've seen Green Hill Zone. Um, how how's this game kind of like, is it just the same levels or are they remixed and changed up at all? So we have several uh familiar zones from like Sonic 1, 2, 3, even CD uh in the game. But uh, you know, the the levels are actually remastered and it's a little new. Um, it's using this uh similar assets. We recreated all the assets. And so it's it's going to have an updated look to it.

Like there is added levels and stuff to it. Like I when I was playing, there's like more of like a cave at the bottom of the Green Hill Zone, which is pretty pretty cool. Flying climb. Hold on. Oh God, no. You just want popcorn. That's all I want in my life is popcorn. Popcorn's great. So what do you think that the balance is going to be between the new levels and old levels? So right right now in uh in our build right now, um the levels are all, you know, focused on Sonic right now. But uh, you know, as you can see with Knuckles and Tails, you there's a lot of places that you can access. And so there's a little bit of fine tuning we'll have to do.

But Sonic 3 is undeniably the best. Not even a question. There's all these CD people out there and I think they're crazy. Dang. Yeah, CD is great.

I mean, we we were hoping to, you know, provide even the animation of the coins is really cool. Oh yeah. Oh, so that one is a a new item actually called the Hyper Ring. It's like a blue ring. Wait, sorry. What where is that? Oh, no, you you so you at one point you took a item box that's a blue ring. So what it does is that it condenses the Rings into huge rings. So when you actually these dudes need to stop Paparazzi. Uh-huh. So about the it just makes the Rings bigger. So you can like uh collect the Rings when you lose it easier. Oh, cool.

I love the the music from Sonic 3 in pretty much every Sonic game now. I wonder why they got rid of the the little Victory theme in Sonic 2. I really like that one. All right, so now I'm going back. That's my boy Sonic. Your boy got to go fast. It's the only way. Knuckles, he's all walking through all nonchalant, beating up them little Paparazzi flies. Tails just doing his thing, looking all adorable. But Sonic, no, nothing will slow him down. That's your boy. My boy. All right, let's see. I'm going to change the going back to Sonic.

Actually, Sonic games is very it has a good balance between like uh zones that are, you know, featured in like more of a naturistic uh versus uh like art. I don't want to say artificial, but like man-made. Yeah, uh structures. So it has a good balance. Um, you know, not many people may realize, but you know, like Sonic 2, like Casino Night, um Chemical Plant are all like very man-made structures where they can have like what Aquatic Zone or the Marble Zone.

Can I do it like that? You got to you got to press you got to press the button. I'm pressing the button. There we go. There we go. So if you jump, you got to do it again. Yeah, so basically double double tap and hold until you hit the ground. There we go. There we go. The classic pinball stuff. Oh, wait, what? Oh, okay. No, that was it's okay. It's okay.
