Colin, yeah, how much have you played? About an hour maybe of the campaign and then online we played a couple matches with our friends at Rooster Teeth. But an hour's worth. Well, um, so I got the code a couple days ago, downloaded it. Uh, was pleasantly surprised actually. So contrasting, I mean, this is kind of just a minor thing, but uh, contrasting it to my experience with Mafia III where um, you download like this smaller package file, then the game acts like it's installed, then it goes into the game and then it just sits there and installs for like five hours because it's actually not on your system yet. I I saw a similar thing with Battlefield where I was like, oh, it's like, oh, 13 gigabytes, I'll download it. We have a great internet, so I was like, download in about 5 minutes. And uh, I was like, there's no way the game's 13 gigabytes. So the game boots up, but then it",

So the game boots up, but then it just isolates a bunch of **** from you and actually lets you play it. So props, I mean, not that this is the first game to do that, but props to uh, to DICE and EA for doing that because I think Mafia really dropped the ball and it was actually quite disappointing. And I I've seen that going around actually. Jim Sterling on The Jimquisition this past week talked about his experience with that Mafia III and how that was kind of **** um, in that regard. So I put the game in and uh, messed around a little bit with the campaign. Uh, a few shout outs to the campaign. First of all, I like the uh, we've talked about this in in the past, I like the vignette style. Um, I think it gives um, a better way to explore a lesser known war um, in World War II. It's very typical for instance, uh, when we played World War II",

It's very typical for instance, uh, when we played World War II Shooters to go from like Normandy into France and then the Netherlands and then down into Germany and just the way the Allies did it. Um, and maybe go to North Africa and maybe have some campaigns in the Soviet Union and then as they pincer in Operation Barbarossa to the east. But it's usually a linear kind of experience. And I like that with this four-year conflict that is lesser known, especially to us in the States, um, because we had a very minor kind of participation in it compared to the European powers. Um, I like that they kind of give you a little flashes of everyone's participation. Um, and I think that's that's really cool. And uh, what I took walked away from with my brief time with the game so far was I really love the way the game's introduced. I think that uh, it's I tweeted out about it. I was",

It's I mean, there's there's blood and gore in it, but from a realistic kind of standpoint, they make you play these different characters and they make you watch them die. Um, and uh, I think that that's really cool because when I was first playing, I was actually stayed alive for a while. I put the game on hard afterwards when you're allowed to like kind of mess around. But in the beginning, I was like kind of confused. I'm like, this must not have started yet. I haven't gotten a chance to pick my difficulty level or anything like that. And so I'm staying alive and I'm running out of ammunition and like running around, then I die and the guy, but he's supposed to die then.",

And I think it's a neat little thing to show like these young men are dying. They're not really dying for anything. The war, as they say in the beginning, I really like how they introduced it saying like World War I was supposed to be the war that ended all wars. Didn't solve a goddamn thing. In fact, it made the the situation much worse. And World War II was basically just a continuation of it. Um, with some different powers. The Ottomans don't exist anymore, for instance. Nazi Germany now exists instead of the German Empire, et cetera. Um, so that was my big takeaway was kind of like the, and I use the term lightly, the historical realism of the game, I think is really cool.

Yeah, Greg, how much did you play? Just the multiplayer we did with Rooster Teeth. So an hour there, whatever. Yeah, yeah, so that was fun. I I played the the prologue bit and I finished the whole first War Story. So there's five total. And man, it's awesome. Like the vignettes are super cool. I love that the way they're introduced. I completely agree with you. I think the prologue is uh, very powerful and it's did does a really good job of kind of using the um, the jumping from person to person as they die to introduce you to different gameplay elements.

And the I think that the the best thing that the game has going for it is that it absolutely nails the tone and the the feel and the look of everything. Beautiful game too. I was I played it on PC on uh, my old ultrawide monitor. And my God, it's just you just see so much uh, of the vista and all the the destruction going on. And I love seeing the um, destructible environments and stuff like as you're going through like these levels because the level in the the first um, War Story is the same one that we played uh, online.

But by the end of the the first War Story and also by the end of our 45 minute match, there's not much left. Like almost everything's destructible. And I I know that's kind of par for the course with the Battlefield. But yeah, it's really cool to see. And I think that the emphasis on tanks, especially in the first mission, the first War Story is entirely based on tanks. They they're doing a really good job of making these things feel like characters themselves. Uh, the the tank literally has a name in the the first mission, Old Bess or something like that. Yeah, Bess. Yeah. And it's it's cool. And it's starts off. So the prologue was super awesome. And it it immediately got my attention. Like the just black with just text.

And to see these characters just kind of get completely destroyed. Like I wish that the the prologue actually, and maybe it does later, because I haven't gone to the end, but I hope it goes back to that. Because like I thought those characters could be really interesting. And that the jump back and forth between, you know, seeing him just kind of chilling in his bed to like being in this horrible place. Like it really feels like war and not like war is cool. Like war is bad. And I think that that's something that obviously games have touched on before, but usually it's more of the like, you're a **** war hero here to **** kill people, one man army.

This really feels like, man, you're kind of screwed. And even if you're winning, you're still kind of screwed. And I mean, that's how the prologue opens. I played through that and it does, you know, I mean, it says you're going to die. Like you won't, you know, this is you're not meant to continue on this way. So to get in there and know you're in this losing battle, but how long can you last before it all goes to hell? Yeah. And and I thought that uh, that was going to kind of continue through to all of the the different story missions into two. And there light spoilers, but I'm not going to go too far.

And I'm like, man, like there's something really satisfying about it being it took probably an hour or 10 minutes to beat the first War Story. There's something satisfying about the contained story. Um, I I feel like the vignettes offer a really unique perspective into campaign design where we're so used to getting this for shooters like 8 to 15 hour experience where you're just kind of doing the things and your character kind of develops over time and like you have troops and stuff. But this allows it to be really character driven, sure. And kind of just let you refresh the characters. Like I'm very excited to try",

And uh, there's a moment with a pigeon where I'm just like, damn, this is beautiful. This D pigeon just flying around. I'm like, it's my boy. I remember we got we got really excited about uh, when I say we, I should probably say I got really excited on Colin and Greg Live when I heard that uh, one of the the modes in the game was using carrier pigeons to kind of send things.

Essential mode of communication. It's funny because like it it started off and uh, I think a big critique I have of the game is the the vehicle controls are very iffy. Um, I never truly feel like I'm in control of the vehicle. And that's whether it's a motorcycle or a plane or a or a tank. Like all the things, it always just feels like I'm kind of winging it. I'm also a little biased because I'm used to controlling Warthogs in Halo. And I remember back in the day that being like so obtuse and weird. But now it's just like, oh, well, that just feels right.

Yeah, I could I couldn't I needed to invert. And it was I felt like I did. I actually honestly went into the menu and I was like, it is inverted. I don't understand like what's going on here. I guess that's true. Um, so I don't know exact like I don't know if it was just me or whatever. No, it wasn't because I kept crashing my plane too. I guess because I was trying to figure out what the difference was. But I don't know if it was the type of maybe it's the type of plane we're flying, maybe. And I don't know.

And it's also because I keep trying to use the right stick like a Warthog, but that just makes you look this way. So like you're looking the wrong way, driving off. But uh, again, that's a that definitely sounds like a me problem. It doesn't seem like too many other people are having that issue.

Battlefield um, and it was always a stark contrast to Call of Duty or kind of even more than that to the first, the the the really the one player single player very Man versus the world kind of shooter. And I play a lot of shooters. Um, I really like the genre a lot. I typically play them single player, but I play Call of Duty almost every year, the campaign. And I play Doom and obviously Wolfenstein. I mean, these are these are these are great games amongst many many others. And I feel like there's a place for those kinds of games. I feel like there's a place for me against the world kind of games. Doom is, you know, totally outrageous and but really really fun.

And then you're kind of sneaking around, you can play the game different ways and stuff like that. Uh, Call of Duty, I feel like has, you know, obviously ebbed and the as the years have gone by more into having like your own pseudo squad with you. And sometimes there are monster closets and sometimes there's a finite amount of enemies on the screen. But Call of Duty has its own feel. And what I realized when I was playing Battlefield was um, I don't really like playing games like Battlefield typically because I don't like these wide open areas where there it seems like there it's more objective based where enemies are just going to continue to come until you do what what is necessary, similar to World at War, which was",

Um, but you but I can't deny that I I I still like I dig it because of the setting, because of the unique kind of setting. Um, and really the impressive technical vastness of of the areas and and as you said, the destructibility, which is the hallmark of the another hallmark of Battlefield, which I really enjoyed. But I feel like um, at the same time, I feel like I had a blast without really expecting it playing multiplayer as well. And uh, even though it's like hectic and kind of heinous and silly, it's it's still fun.

Um, World War I started for very specific reasons with very specific delineations. But you wouldn't necessarily look at one side of the other and be like, well, you know, the Ottomans were evil, German-Hungarians and all them were evil, or the British were evil. It's like, yeah, it's just it wasn't quite like that.

And then basically, I mean, what I walked away from and I thought it was kind of overt and kind of beating you over the head was like, it's all for nothing. And it's you don't really know what the hell are you're even fighting for. And you gain control of these characters and they're dead a minute later. And that was basically their experience as just fodder, cannon fodder, as tens of millions of people around the world that ended up fighting in the conflict.

I love Call of Duty. Um, I I can't help but feel like it's going to win the day there too.

But I I know I'm going to be able to on foot and I'm going to be able to **** shoot guns. And obviously you can do that in Battlefield. But at the same time, I didn't quite like starting in the tank. And I agree with you on that. I loved the mission, but I thought it was weird that it it's immediately starts you off in that. And I would say the majority of the the whole first fifth of the game, you're in the tank for probably a third of it. So you don't really kind of get out on foot until like pretty far into it.

So it it's I feel like it does a really good job of of kind of being a tutorial for the online experience. Uh, I played the online stuff before I did it. So when I was playing through the single-player, I'm like, oh, this really explains like the the Conquest mode or like the how you're supposed to go about this stuff. And uh, when I was first playing, there was like a question of like, who is on my team and who's not on my team because it is such a grand scale",
