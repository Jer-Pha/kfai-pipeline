Nick: I have a couple questions because you told me this story before and I immediately thought we need to do a sting operation (Greg: YES!) but... Colin: So, we do the sting operation, we find out (Greg in a sensual voice: we do the stinggg) who the person is, but we DO NOT confront them. Nick: See, I'm with Colin. Colin: THEN you figure out who they are and then you follow THEM in some respect to their car. And then, you just SHIT on their car (Greg and Tim in unison: Yeah!). It's a war of escalation, it's shock and awe, as George W. Bush might call it. Nick: We need to drill into the hood of Tim's car... I want that, and I want you to buy 4 high-powered carbine rifles (Tim: *laughing*) And, those little things that, like, you pull and they pop out for parties (Greg: Party Poppers!)? I need at least five of those. And then, and then maybe on the third night, that's when we set up the speaker system. Now, the speaker system's",

Now, the speaker system's gonna be elaborate. It needs to be surround-sound, at least 7.1. And (Kevin: *laughing*) when the person does it for the third time, it needs to be... ...fucking... ...CHAOS. Oh my God, we need to come at that person and just TRAUMATIZE them. Cops, FAKE cops, pulling up, someone gets SHOT (fake) to the point where the joke just keeps GOING. Where this person's like \"What is happening?\" and then the stripper poles come in and the dance party starts and it's like a foam party... And they're like, \"I think I'm off the hook, maybe these people like me!\" and then we FUCKING KILL 'EM! (All: *laughing*)",
