Every time we we talk to him, whether it's he supports us on Patreon, so he we just did a Google Hangout with or Skype hangout with him or whatever, and he is just the funniest kid. Like this guy's stories, he like every time we talk to him, he like introduces The Hangout as if he's doing a podcast, but he's not recording it, so he's just doing it for his own edification and for us and all. He's good at it, it's so funny. Uh, but he he brought a topic up to us and uh, I wanted to make sure that I, you know, discussed it in front of front of everybody because it's very, very important.

So when they're peeing, if you walk in, you're just seeing the cheeks like to your ankles. Yes, yes, yes, that's a thing that people do. Some people, some people really. We know it more from like when you were a little kid, like there was always that one guy, yeah, like always in elementary school. I could tell you his name, I won't, 'cause I'm sure he's very successful. I remember this kid, but fucking kid, it's just like we're all here like, dude, like that's too much, man.

You had a kid in middle school that would do it? Oh, in middle school, yeah, there was a kid, his name was Kevin. Some need a fucking parent. But uh, but there was some, you know, whatever, teach their own. And so apparently SnowBikeMike has to deal with a situation where he works with somebody. Oh no, workplace cheek. Yeah, work workplace cheek. Yeah, so that gets kind of awkward because imagine there these are workers, so when there's other people and they're wearing staff shirts at the place they work at, so then like a customer will walk in and see this and be like, that that guy's going full cheek.

No, it's not, but it happens. All right, so I I guess we can all kind of decide that we think that it's not acceptable. Sure, but I kind of thought this was a nice jump off point for just public bathroom etiquette. Andrea, would you at a bar, and let's say you're a guy, you're at a bar, would you bring your drink into the bathroom? Um, I always do, but I always cover it with a paper towel because as a woman, I can never leave my drink by itself. Sure, safety call. Um, so it's like the idea of bringing a drink in a bathroom is never a good thing. If you're at a table with friends, obviously leave it. If you're with trusted people, they'll watch it for you. But yeah, no, like what the stuff flying in the air is no, you have to cover it",

But yeah, no, like what the stuff flying in the air is no, you have to cover it like either with toilet paper or with a towel, whatever. It's clean and close. See, this is this was a this is, I mean, my entire IGN career, an argument that existed on Game Scoop of whether or not at a bar, you're a guy, you could take it in and go to the urinal and pee and not have to worry about it. I mean, you can, I did it all the time back in the day. Now, who cares? With a with a beer bottle, it's not the risk of getting something in there is not as bad. But if you brought a wide mouth cup like this in there, there's poop particles floating. Remember Damon was really up and on that's. But a man at a urinal is it is different than a woman in a stall. Like you're much 100% contained space where the germs are much more concentrated. They have but the urinal things, there's a lot of splashback, but it's it's so",

We're losing the sight of the the main argument because I agree, you should be able to bring your drinking and then hold it as you're peeing or put it on top of the or I don't give a fuck what you do with it. The the the thing is that we're we we we act the bathroom's gross, right? But so is the rest of your world. Your phone is fucking disgusting. Uh, like your hands are disgusting. The fucking you're touching is disgusting. Everyone just like magnifies when they go to the bathroom. I'm like, what is there's really almost no difference honest to Christ of just holding your beer at the bar and holding it in the bathroom. They're both fucking disgusting. 100% right.

My phone, this is what cracks me up when we go to events is like, you know, I pride myself on leaving events not getting sick because I got sick at one Comic-Con and that was like the game changer where I'm going to sterilize my hands all before I eat anything.

If you are on the bus holding a bar and you want to go go get a drink or something, maybe I don't know, like, is it really the end of the world?

And we all went and the mom, you know, she's beaten by this, Greg, of course. And she's like, you guys have no idea what your body is capable of fighting off. Like she first off needs to build an immune system. So no, but like also don't overthink it. It's not to that point. Yeah, no, for sure.

I don't care if they're talking in their if they're on their stall, uh, in the stall on the phone. The thing, the number one thing that I absolutely can't stand about bathroom etiquette is when people don't fucking flush the toilet. It is the worst. How do you get up and go to leave the stall and not flush the toilet? Yeah, no, I mean, I'm right there with you. My only thing is there there's a point of no return. What does that mean? Where if that toilet is just was shit by the time you got there and there's been 30 people been through there, why are you using it then?",

There's I always have that decision of all right, I don't even want my foot touching that, you know what I mean? And that is when I won't flush it first off. Otherwise, you should only be flushing with your foot. Abs. It's got one of the little the little metal handle coming out. Flush that shit with your foot. No, don't touch that. If it's got the little black button, you got no choice. That's why they put the little black button. Take this a step further to your point. I had an experience once that was very informative.

And uh, they I I I went to flush and it kind of halfway flushed. This was like a few years ago. Sure. And then I walked out and the one was walking in and I was like, wait a minute. And like had this thing and like went back and for she and she was laugh, she was really cool. She's like, you didn't flush the toilet. And I'm like, no, I did, but it went halfway down. All so now like I I'm like, no, that would have been fucked up even if someone walked in five minutes later to find that I was being lazy or whatever about it. So I've gotten to the point the last few years where even if I find the toilet not in like a fucking gas station, you know, like where there a little bit of pee sprinkle on it or whatever",

And like, and I'm like, I don't want this woman to walk in thinking that I left the bathroom like this. So I have to actually jump on the grenade and be a gentleman and do the right thing even though I don't want to. And then I wash my hands and it's all fine. But you know, I tried. So that was a very kind of educational experience with you. I hate being the bigger man. Like we went to Docho's recently and I went in there just to wash my hands and then I was like, well, I'm here, I'll pee too. And I peed and then like you and the flusher is just broken.
