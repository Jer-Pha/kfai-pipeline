I never thought it was gonna suck. So I mean, that's one, that's one of the things and I've said it before and I said it again, I said this will be nothing less than good. I've said that a million times, right? To my credit, I never said it was going to be bad. I just said it's not going to reach the expectations of a 10-year development cycle, right? And I feel like I was happy to see that. I read a few of them. I've been seeing a lot of the feedback people have been tweeting to me and I've just been kind of cursory reading the websites and seeing that. And I'm happy. I don't want any game to be bad, so I hope Final Fantasy XV is awesome. I don't believe it like in terms of like, in terms of like",

I think we're going to get copies of it sooner rather than later and I and I I'm pleased to see it. I'm not surprised. I never said the game was going to be bad. I am very surprised and I am very excited about all this. There's been a whole bunch of previews out. There's a really long one on IGN. There's a super long one on Polygon. Parish wrote one too. Jeremy Parish is the one where I'm like, all right, IGN, okay, cool. Polygon, great. But Jeremy Parish, he seems like a Colin type **** to me where it's like USgamer.

And like, I love that it seems like everybody is super up on the the battle system and that the combat uh it starts out awkward and you don't really like it, which is an experience I had in the demos that have come out. Um, but then as it goes on, it gets deeper and it feels good and it feels like you're learning it as it goes. And um, I recently watched all the anime and stuff, so I'm already super invested in the the story and I'm totally sold on that. I mean, I've been sold on this game for a long time, but to hear that people like it is like, oh man, it just feels like a weight's been lifted. Like, and we'll see how how far this goes.

You played 15 hours of, yeah, but so I I'm a little trepidatious just because like, I know how this **** goes when it comes to to websites and stuff. And I feel like it's you want to lean positive on on something like this. Uh, but for these guys to be saying this, it means a lot to me. And that was the thing I took away from the Polygon one of like, it starts like, we've joked about how many reviews are going to start that way of like, I was in just entering college when this happened and da da da, like the chips are stacked against this game.

I'm like, okay, you're because again, that's the whole thing. I've been as an outsider looking in as a non-Final Fantasy fan. When he's never cared about the the franchise looking in, I've always think it's cool what you're talking about sounds cool, but I'm worried about it getting in and it just being another really, really nerdy JRPG kind of thing. And so like, looking from the outside, reading this, I'm I'm still looking forward to playing it.

Like, I think that it's good that they're addressing that. I think that it that's really kind of saying in a big way, like, yo, we understand things haven't been great, you know? And I think that they're really trying to start something different. And other thing that's really important is I think that the all three articles that I read are talking about how it feels like a good Western RPG and a good JRPG together. And that's awesome because it's it there is the worries for people like Colin that it's going to be not Japanese enough in terms of gameplay. Um, I don't think there's any worry about it not being Japanese enough in terms of quite Japanese, whatever. But it's also like reading, I I didn't want to watch too much because",

Like that's way too much time for me to put into this game to potentially have to do it again. Yeah. Um, but I I really like that the it seems like the the characters, uh especially again after watching the anime and like being sold on this stuff, uh it seems like it's very light-hearted and like these are just bros hanging out and their relationships between all of them. And uh and they make jokes about the clothes that they're wearing. It's like one of them keeps complaining about how hot it is and he's like, dude, you're wearing a leather jacket in the desert.

So I mean, this is shocking to me. Like the fact that all these sites are being so positive about, I'm just like, oh my God, yes, your dreams. My, could the NX be coming? Could the NX be good? Who knows? This is so exciting. Anyway, that's what I think. Joron, Joron Ghost Jacobs Destroy Galaxy, do you guys think that releasing only two weeks before Horizon Zero Dawn will hurt Persona 5 sales? No. No. Yeah, I mean, they're they're different audiences in the same audience at the same time.

But if you heard about this open world RPG Western kind of thing, I don't think Persona is necessarily for you. Yeah, exactly. Time wise, it's going to be tough trying to balance those as as a guy who wants to both real bad, trying to run through one or worry about the other and not or put one off till you're done because you I don't want to be playing two giant RPGs.

Yeah, I mean, I just based on a couple other people responding to that, that's what got got got. You gotta, I wouldn't call them generic voice actor. Matt Mercer, who's like the DM for Critical Role, who has a huge following. No, he and who does a million video games, not to leave that out too. He's not a generic voice actor. Uh, but even even uh speaking of them, like if they to be in this game, I mean, like, yes, when you get trained, you get so familiar with them, you start to be able to to differentiate like, oh, this character is this person.

And it is that thing where like, I I I'm not familiar enough with the new these the new cast yet other than Matt. But the one of the female voice actors got tweeted at and they included me saying, you should get this girl on the show. She's super cool. And you went and look, she has credits. It's not like these people are just like dudes, they've just walked in like, I've never voice acted before. They they've been voice acting.

Yeah, there was there is all those the Genesis and Super Nintendo games, The Aladdin and Lion King and all those. And I love them. Yeah, but being completely honest, they they don't feel great to play. Like even the Magical Castle and all that stuff, like it's there's something about them a little too floaty. I love the look, I love the music, I love everything about it. It's Disney, so obviously I'm super into it.

Sure, because you're a dumb little kid. Now, speaking of just being a dumb little kid who grew up into a dumb man baby, maybe did did you did Epic Mickey get you going? Did you get was that something you liked? So Epic Mickey was one of those those big disappointments for me where uh I remember when it was first announced this Mickey game, the um the Game Informer cover and like all we got was an image and a name, Epic Mickey, which was the code name at the time.

And the idea that it's about the lost and forgotten things from Disney's history and like the the world you living is Disneyland with a bunch of broke down rides and all this stuff. And I'm like, are you kidding me? This sounds like the most Tim Gettys game of all time. And it's super super cool. And then the more you started hearing about, there was music that dropped from me. I'm like, well, this is great. It was like remixes of the Fantasia like um paint thing where mess around with a sorcerer and all that ****. I there's so much there.

Like I would have taken it, you know? I would have been like, you know what, great, good enough. But it it wasn't good enough. Um, and then there was the hope that the the sequel would fix that and it didn't. It didn't at all. But uh that game, I wished broke your heart. I it did. It did.

And I feel like as it went on, it's it's just gotten more Disney and the Final Fantasy has kind of left it. Um, in terms of characters at least, like they're kind of just scattered around. But in one and two, they were really uh prevalent. But trying to think out, is there anything else? Because yeah, I mean, DuckTales was amazing. Yeah, I was going to say there was there's a few good NES games from that from Disney or Disney licenses. Disney to make them. Capcom made most of the games. Um, yeah, I mean, that's basically it.

God, can you? I couldn't imagine. There's no reason to do that if they're not gonna continue with the series, you know? So that would be great. But that's that's just not going to happen.

Um, but it's not Thousand-Year Door. It's not the original Paper Mario on N64. And it's not Super Mario RPG. Uh, or even the Mario & Luigi games on the GBA.

Um, but I always thought it was weird like Square or Square Soft is making a Mario game. I I remember I was like, that's I don't understand that. Um, and it was it came out on a console that had a lot of great role playing games. So like when I think about the great role playing games on Super Nintendo, that game never comes to mind to be honest. Uh, but the move away from RPG elements happens.

Will this change how remasters are made and if they need to stop doing this? I understand what he means. The it's a weird sentence structure. He was saying that people are saying the same thing about both collections. I haven't played Arkham. I have I I've only played Arkham Asylum. I haven't noticed it being brighter and not as grim and dark as Arkham Asylum was before reading IGN's review. Their whole thing was just like it the brightness kind of like really reveals the flaws of um the game being developed on a last-gen system. Well, sure, it's an old game. Yeah, yeah. But like when it it being brighter though, um because it when you see the graphics",
