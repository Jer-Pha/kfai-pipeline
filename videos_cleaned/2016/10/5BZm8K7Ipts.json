      "text": "What's up guys, Alfredo here from over at Twitch.tv/AlfredoPlays and this is my Kinda Funny Reacts discussion and review for Titanfall 2. So just recently the Kinda Funny guys sent me down to check out the Titanfall 2 review event which I played the whole entire campaign from start to finish and then all of multiplayer in its entirety. So do I recommend people play this game? Yes. Why? Titanfall 2 this time around in my opinion has depth to it. The main issue with Titanfall 1 was the lack of content and not the game itself. People enjoyed their time with the game but after a couple months it was just too bare bone and didn't have much content so people just fell off. Um, now we've got a campaign and multiplayer and multiplayer with enough content that I feel that people would stick around for longer than just a couple weeks. Um, so let's dive into the positives and negatives of campaign in my opinion. So you start off as Jack Cooper, you're a basic soldier who dreams of becoming a pilot. Now",

So you start off as Jack Cooper, you're a basic soldier who dreams of becoming a pilot. Now the Pilots are the most elite soldiers. You've got all these types of gadgets and weapons at your disposal. You could double jump, you can create a hologram of yourself, you have different types of weapons and grenades and most importantly you have a Titan at your disposal, a Titan Companion. Now this Titan, you know, you jump in it and you get to just destroy everything in your path. Now they they talk about how Titans can only be um, defeated by overwhelming odds or say another Titan, you know, and that's it's really cool. Um, immediately you start off the campaign with taking command of Titan BT-7274 after his previous owner was killed. It's like right in the beginning of the game. Um, The Campaign continues as you fighting against the IMC. Um, they want to take over all the colonies and the resources",

Um, the things that did like about the campaign was first and foremost great platforming moments within the campaign throughout the entire like entire story and it was ingenious the way they used some of like the mechanics. I often found myself saying um, you know, just really happy about how I was like moving around or trying to figure things out or or traversing through the level. It wasn't just running as a Pilot and double jumping or running around as a a huge Titan. They they they really made you think about how you're maneuvering around the map in certain situations and I loved it. So just overall great platforming moments which took me by surprise. Um, there",

Um, I completely believe that they nailed the balance between Pilot and Titan gameplay. Um, I didn't feel like I was a Pilot for too long. I didn't feel like I was a Titan for too long and I can easily go between you know, back and forth between the two. Um, they made it really easy for you to kind of switch between the different Titan loadouts which I liked a lot. Um, I was often scared I might be stuck as Scorch who was a slower Titan that dealt AoE damage like for specific level but that's not the way they they they took things which was great because when you go throughout a mission right, you'll either see like a you know, a Titan Loadout rack and you can pick up a a new Titan load",

You switch between whatever Titan you want and I was really really happy about that 'cause like I said, I don't want to go around a whole mission as a you know, as the Titan that can snipe. Like it's not me, that's not how I like to play. So I like that they didn't force you into that. Um, as a Titan I felt unstoppable. Um, as a Pilot I felt both powerful. Um, you know, I felt like this elite Pilot parkour ninja running around, you know, double jumping and and using camo to get behind people and sliding and gunning everything.

There there were definitely times where they separated you from your Titan. There's definitely times where you felt like even though you could do all these cool things, it wasn't enough. Um, moving forward, they did give you options for when to you're responding to BT, your Titan. Um, doesn't affect gameplay at all but it does does add a little bit more between your bond between you know, um, Titan and Pilot. Um, there was a handful of oh sh*t that's cool moments in the game. Um, but more rather moments than the actual plot itself. We'll get into the plot in a little bit. Um, there are collectible Pilot helmets throughout the entire you know, campaign. They were fun to find. I'm one of those people that I like collecting things but I don't want to search you know, for hours in one room to maybe find something or have to shoot random",

So it was one of those things that you know, I took the time to look for them now and then and I got most of them throughout the campaign. So I thought that was a really good balance in terms of uh, just collectibles um, in a in a story. Now on the things that I didn't like about campaign, um, you know, they talk about how soldiers dream about being these really cool Pilots, all these awesome things that they can do. They're veterans on the battlefield. They've got all these weapons at at their disposal, not to mention you know, the amazing Titan and after the first tutorial and",

But after after the first sample of missions, I was sitting there like, I already feel like I'm a a badass Pilot. I'm doing the double jumping, I'm sneaking up behind people, snapping their necks, you know, um, going in and out of my Titan, shooting the hell out of everything. And at that point I was just kind of waiting for the plot to catch up to to me right, 'cause I felt like, all right, I'm a lead Pilot, got it. And you know, going throughout the story, they're just like, all right, you're still learning, you're still adapting. I'm like, I kind of feel like I'm there already.

Um, I didn't really so much care about the war I was fighting or the characters on each side. Um, and might that might just be a me thing, even though I don't think it is. Um, I say it might be a me thing because when a chunk of the plot is delivered by VO, I tend not to get too invested into the story and that's simply because I'm just too distracted on playing the game rather than taking focus on the comms going on and off blaring your ear along with the explosions and all the other sounds that are going off. This this this game does have amazing sounds by the way. Um, so at the end of the day for me, a campaign that is heavily delivered by just VO on some comms, I I didn't really connect with it. Um, another issue that I had with the campaign was they introduced these really cool bosses um, at the beginning of the level and by",

And there was definitely some cool bosses like uh, Ash for example, she had the Ronin Titan and I was just like, all right, this is a cool looking character. And by the time that mission was done, she was done. So I would have definitely have loved to have more than just these uh, I don't know, I would have liked for them to have elaborated more on these characters. I think that would have helped me care about the story more as well too. Um, you know, there were I would have liked to have seen more Titans like the the boss fight Viper. Um,",

He was in the air the whole time during that boss fight and that's what I really liked because the other you know, whether it'd be Ash with her Ronin or the other guy with the Scorch Titan, I was sitting there just like, these are sure they they attach characters to but these are essentially the same Titans you fight like a million times in multiplayer. Um, Viper at least had a little bit more to him right? He stayed hovering in the air.

Just something more than just fighting the same Titans that I fought a million times in multiplayer. Um, the pacing at some points felt a little off to me. The first uh, there's about eight missions, took me about 7 hours to complete. There's one um, tutorial to go along with that. And like the first couple missions, I was done with fairly quick. And then out of nowhere they hit you with like this extremely long mission. Granted it was a cool mission. It was a mission where uh, you're in a factory and they're building the colony like, I don't know, I guess colony homes because they just you know, they're smashing houses and all the pieces that go along with that.

So it was it was a cool level but it was it was if to me it felt like it was the first two, three missions combined in terms of length. And I was like, here's these quick like 10-minute missions and all a sudden there's like this 40-minute mission out of nowhere. So the the pacing felt a little weird to me at first. It it definitely does um, pace itself better during the second half of the campaign. Um, what else do I have to say about that? Um, yeah, I don't know man.

Um, but at the end of the day, I don't think I ever I'll ever see myself going back to playing the campaign. I don't see myself raving about it to anyone uh, to anyone else. And I I I left the ending wishing that I cared more, wishing that I connected more emotionally um, to the story. And so I don't think it was a great campaign but my no by no means do I think it was a terrible one as well. It was just kind of there right? It just kind of existed and it had its great moments but damn orange soda is delicious. It had it great moments but I don't see myself going back to it. I played it. I'm glad",

So I think there's potential for if there's a Titanfall, I think we'll see a Titanfall 3 and a campaign. Um, so I hope that maybe some more maybe maybe some cutscenes or maybe I know a different way to deliver the story would have would have worked for me a little bit more. But uh, not terrible, just not great, solid, just mediocre, you know, middle line campaign. Um, moving on to multiplayer, uh, great shooting mechanics. I know there was a lot of issues with week one of the tech test. The time to kill was way too short. Um, you know, wall running didn't feel like you really gained speed and momentum but they they changed those week two of the tech test.

Um, the mechanics were there and they worked. I like the fact that there was a lot in terms of customization or your weapons, uh, your character and your Titan. So you can customize your character right there like pages of pages of we like just camos. You customize your character, then you can customize your gun specifically, then you can customize your Titan, your Titan's weapon specifically and you can even put like a little decal on the front of your Titan. So there's a lot of depth in terms of customization which is great because you know, I feel like this is you know, you give me a campaign or this is my Titan and we're supposed to have this bond and I feel like my Titan's going to look a certain way right?",

And uh, it's not going to look just like every other Titan. So I like that they give you that option in multiplayer. Um, you do get a handful of call signs and and you know, camos like I was discussing. So there's there's that in the game. Um, I like how they don't have burn cards this time around. I know some people had issues with that but burn cards in Titanfall 1 were essentially like these boosters, boosters that you can go with uh, go into the middle like in you know, start of a match. Um, some of the boosters were you can go in with an amped weapon right away or I mean not right away but essentially you had boost like you had these burn cards and you had I don't know maybe like three of them and you choose which one right?

Or let's just amp our weapons up. And I didn't like that. Um, I didn't feel like it was balanced properly. I didn't feel like it worked really well. So they took that out. Um, you you don't have that anymore. Um, you do have one booster that you can designate and then use um, through the match kind of like how you call your Titan. So that's that's nice. I like that a lot. One of the things positive that they have in multiplayer is that they remove the enemy spawn points on the map.

Um, looking through the footage of like Amped Hardpoint and playing, I didn't see that on my map. So it looks like they removed it all together. Um, I like how the Titans in multiplayer have more character going back to that. Um, but not just with the camo. To elaborate on that, I want to say that it's really cool because in the in Titanfall 1 you had right? The Strider, Atlas, and then Ogre right? So essentially one was fast, didn't have much armor, one was the middle ground, one was slow but had a lot of armor. And then you just choose whatever weapon you wanted.

So when I was on the battlefield, that transitions very well into into gameplay 'cause when I'm on the battlefield, if I see you know, the Titan that you know, looks like Ronin, I'm like, okay, he has this specific load out. I know he's going to try and get close to me. You know, I know this that specific Titan is going to try and snipe me. I know that one has a 40 mm Cannon. I know Ion, you know, has a laser beam. So it really worked wonders I think in my opinion in terms of gameplay, seeing a Titan being able to distinguish like what its load out is and then trying to think tactically on how you trying to approach that Titan.

So you could take hits from people and then just kind of back off. You can get take hits from Pilots to be more specific, then kind of just back off, let your shield regenerate and it was really overpowering. It got to the point where if you had a organized team that had I don't know three, four, five Titans up and you didn't have a Titan or maybe you called in one and they all just just jumped on that Titan. It felt there was a lot of times where I was forcing other teams to kind of just sit inside in a hallway where I couldn't reach them and wait for their spawn uh, wait for their Titans to come up.

Do I just want to go balls to the walls on this? You know, they even have a battery system where if you do get a battery um, say from another Titan, you know, you get to regenerate some of your health. You you get a shield that you don't spawn down with. Um, if a Pilot takes off a battery from you, he takes some of your health but you could kill him and get some of your health back and a shield.

So maybe leaving it there for a second, someone might come out the out of left field and start shooting you uh, or trying to take your Titan apart. So I feel like the the way they approach Titans and Titanfall 2 uh, is very solid. I I very much like the mechanics and system that they use for it. Um, there are a variety of game modes because I know a lot of people not everyone likes using a Titan, not everyone you know, wants to be just the Pilot. So you have Last Titan Standing which allows you to be you know, Titan versus Titan. You have Pilot versus Pilot, so there's no Titans.

There is also a game called Coliseum which essentially is just a 1v1 and just a dome where you can run around in. It was really cool. You get a Charge Rifle for precision for uh, precision shots and you get like a Plasma Launcher and a grenade. You just run around, you know, double jumping, wall running just in a straight up 1v1. That was really awesome to see. Um, and then overall it's just a rewarding leveling system. Uh, I felt like at the end of every match I was was leveling up something.

I feel like I only use that to get to the top of a house, you know what I mean? Like uh, or maybe a three-story building.

Uh, Titanfall one had maps like Lagoon, which is like, you know, all this water everywhere and it's kind of tropical. You had Angel City, so there was a lot of buildings um you can run around in and hide up top. Um, it was Colony, you know, it was a great PvP map. You had Demeter was a great Capture the Flag map, you know, uh Rise which was very small, had three lanes. Um, of course, I've only had know a certain amount of time playing Titanfall's multiplayer, but nothing I played there made me go, \"Oh wow, this map looks really cool!\" or, \"Oh, you know, this map would be really great for this or that!\" It just kind of felt like, \"All right, there's another multiplayer map.\" I didn't really you",

That's that's definitely an opinion thing. Maybe maybe you'll be a fan of the maps. Um, some of the game modes, uh, specifically Amped Hardpoint promoted camping, which I get it, like they're trying to change up, uh, you know, standard Hardpoint. So Hardpoint, you have, you know, A, B, and C points on the map. You try and hold them, you get points, you you win the game. Amped Hardpoint is their version of it where if you sit on a Hardpoint long enough, you get to amp up the Hardpoint so you get more points for holding that one specific um Point.

I felt like at the start of every Amped Hardpoint match, I felt like I was sitting there like, \"Okay, so I mean technically we should have someone sit back at A and just kind of sit there the whole time while we all the rest of us go fight for B and try and take that over because, you know, you'll amp it up and we'll get like extra points.\" But it's like, who wants to sit back and do that, you know what I mean? And I I just I didn't like the game mode as much as I thought it would. I kind of I get where they were trying to go with it, but I just don't feel like it works. Um, my initial thoughts on the map, and this is this is me being really nitpicky or just haven't had enough time with the game. My initial thought on the maps is they don't promote wall running routes as much. Um, in Titanfall one, you saw Pilots flying around everywhere just bouncing from wall to wall to wall.

Um, and you saw that a lot in Capture the Flag, right? You had flag routes to get from one side of the map to the other like really quick. Here, I felt like a lot of the Pilots were kind of grounded. Um, and there were times where I tried to wall run, but I just kind of didn't feel like I was able to connect to more than a couple walls here and there rather than like get across the whole map. And this could simply be because I haven't had too much time with the game. Um, I think I've had maybe like 40 hours overall. Um, I know it doesn't sound like 40 hour like 40 hours with two maps like the Homestead for Base Kai and then like eight hours with like all the other maps. Yeah, let me let me say that that way. Um, but yeah, I mean, I think that is pretty much my reacts discussion review for the game for Titanfall. The Campaign",

Um, it had its moments, but I don't see myself playing it again. Multiplayer was very, very fun. I know that in terms of what I didn't like, that's more just me being nitpicky, but multiplayer, it plays well. There's a lot of depth to it, that's what I want to leave you guys off with. There's a lot of depth to it, there's a lot of game modes, there's a lot of things you can do in multiplayer. So I feel like this game, I feel like Titanfall more so than last time around, will will hold its own, you know, alongside all the other FPS games. And uh, I think it's something to look forward to if you guys are looking for multiplayer. As a campaign game, it wasn't too strong, but, you know, it's it's good to have campaign 'cause we saw not having",

I'm looking forward to it. Even talking about it right now, I kind of want to jump in and play more multiplayer. Um, so I think it's going to be a great game for those of you guys that are looking for a solid, more futuristic shooter. I know we have Battlefield, which, you know, went back in time, and for Call of Duty, most people, I think the majority, are going to play Remastered, so that's back in time as well. So I think as a more futuristic shooter, I think that will fill the gap for a lot of you guys. And uh, I think you guys will have fun. We'll have a lot of fun playing it too, um, when we stream and whatnot.
