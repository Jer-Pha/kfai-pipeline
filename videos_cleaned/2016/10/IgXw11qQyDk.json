So they decided, whatever, we're just going to start our own watch company. That's kind of like us. We're like, you know what, we see all these other people making YouTube videos, we can do it too. Let's start Kinda Funny. MVMT Watches start at just $95. At a department store, you're looking at hundreds of dollars to get a watch. I remember one time me and Nick Scarpino went to uh that there Nordstrom's trying to get me a watch. Yeah, let me tell you, it was cool but it was expensive. Here, MVMT Watches, they figured out that by selling online they're able to cut out the middleman and retail markup providing the best possible price, classic design, quality construction, and styled minimalism. We just got a bunch of them. Colin got a black and blue one, Nick got this real sleek one, and Greg Greg got a fancy red and",

We we've heard that he might be alive. Someone on Twitch claims that he's alive, but I don't know if it's really him. Yeah, I'm not sure.

Um, so as always, the final topic is a bunch of your questions. You can go to KindaFunny.com/gamescasttopic just like all my boys over here did. Loga Boga says, who's been the best video game villain in the 2010s? My choice would be the Wild Hunt from Witcher 3 or the Elusive Man in the Mass Effect series. Um, I mean, I I mean, I jump and we just mentioned it, so maybe that's why, but David in The Last of Us, he was a great villain. He was a great foil. He was creepy as all hell, you know what I mean? He was he was a different kind of villain too, in the way that he wasn't like some bulky boss. He was this wiry little creepy dude, you know what I mean? He had this creepy thing going on. And then when he reveals that like he knows who you got, he's like, oh yeah,",

That was fun. No, that's a good call. Yeah, I can't I mean, I would need to see my trophies to see what I've even played in the last five years that I would I would consider uh yeah, The Last of Us is a good choice. I think a lot of the Uncharted villains are pretty cool. Um, Lazarevi\u0107, maybe except for Laar. I like I like Marlowe a lot. Got to drink this blue sap. Yeah, I don't know. It's a good question. It's Kefka from Final Fantasy 6. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. I mean, let's think about it like what what have been kind of the the franchises of the the last decade or so? Like you say 2010, but like let's even give it like the 2000s in there too. But I mean, franchises, I mean, that's the problem is so many games have",

Like I I like I think of it and the villain and what the boss battle is going to be like and stuff like that. And Uncharted always has cool villains, but then their the battles always suck so much that I would never want to put them in there. Same thing with like even like like Infamous. Well, Infamous isn't I mean, if we're if we're going that far back, I mean, Kessler was cool. I thought I enjoyed what Kessler was doing. But like, you know, what was her name in uh Second Son? Oh, um uh no, that's con no, that's right. Augustine. Const that sounds right. Yeah, Augustine. That's not it. But yeah, something like that.

I'm like, The Walking Dead was and then you get to the end of The Walking Dead and it's just like totally shoehorned in guy in a station wagon. You're like, what the what's this thing? Andrew Ryan in BioShock's an amazing choice, but that's not in the 2010s. That's why I'm not. Well, still, I mean, I think I think he's kind of asking about the talking about Mass Effect. So, oh yeah, I guess the Elusive Man's Mass Effect 2008 was in 2009. No, 2010, right? And then Mass Effect 3 is 2012. So maybe it was 2008, 2009. I don't know, whatever.

What I always loved about that was the the Chimera specifically because with the exception of the Angels and stuff like that, you don't really meet them the entire time. The the the Chimera you're fighting are mutated humans. Um, so I always like that you have played this entire Trilogy without ever really dealing with the source of the problem. And I'm sure that they intended on doing that, but they couldn't. They didn't have time or the space, the games to do it. I guess three games was too much to uh or too few to uh to get to the **** point. Um, they were writing them like old IGN reviews. Yeah, uh yeah, I I dig.

Like he's like one of my favorite parts was so caught off guard and like I loved what they did there, let alone how great he had been before, including Origins, an underrated game. Mhm, very cool. Let us know in the comments because I'm sure you guys are like screaming at the computers right now or how the hell you the ghost woman from Tomb Raider. Um, Anita Bath says, hey guys, I don't know about you, but I really miss the creativity that the old Rare brought to Nintendo and video games in general.

My question is this, what are the chances Nintendo will unveil a studio that can deliver for the NX or do you think they'll continue to squeeze more semi-predictable games from their beloved and incredibly old franchises? Signed an X Nintendo Die Hard. Oh my gosh, you don't need a Rare to do that. You just need to buy the IPs. This is what Sony does masterfully, I think. And and um maybe less so now than they used to, but Sony has a stable second party studios that make these new games for them uh that they own. And uh this this fills the channel with a new IP without having to invest in a new studio, which is a costly investment and maybe not a wise investment to do these days. So I don't think that they're going to make, you know, they you have to remember Nintendo didn't make Rare, Nintendo bought Rare.

I it seems like those relationships are waning that like people don't really seem to want to necessarily be bought anymore as they were 10 years ago when everyone was very eager to be bought. I mean, we remember Naughty Dog all getting purchased in 2004 and uh Sucker Punch getting purchased in 2009 and uh or 2011 actually it was right right before Infamous, I think. Um, and uh so, you know, but we still have studios that you are that I'm surprised have been purchased. Quantic Dream, I can't believe Quantic Dream is still independent. I can't believe Housemarque is still independent.

Although they had a few a couple on Wii U, I think that people liked to a lesser Splatoon to a massive degree. And then a lesser degree, some people liked like, you know, Captain Toad and all these other kind of. So I think that they they exist there, but I think that, you know, it reminds me more of the 3DS where a lot of the novel **** on 3DS is coming from third party. So um I think that the relationship has to kind of go like that. But I I agree with you, I think Nintendo misses Rare and I think Rare has never been the same. Well, Rare's done. I mean, Rare now is is just like, all right, yeah, I mean, it's they're so far they're it's the same thing with Naughty Dog, right?

Uh they are a new Naughty Dog, a much better Naughty Dog now. Um, and so you could say maybe the opposite of Rare, but you could definitely say definitively that the old Rare is dead too. And so they can they could reinvent themselves again. Yeah, definitely. And it's interesting to me to to look at uh something like Retro Studios where so Rare reinvented what Donkey Kong meant like making Donkey Kong Country. Uh and I think that with Retro they did Metroid Prime, which reinvented what Metroid meant, right? Um, and then they took Donkey Kong Country and brought it back and didn't so much reinvent it as much as reinvigorate it and like really kind of give it a polish and a and the respect that a franchise of",

So I think that Retro is kind of there, they're new Rare. Um, but I would love to see Retro do that on the NX, but they're probably going to be doing Metroid, you know. Um, but I'd love for them to just come out with some new IP that is the what we think of as being that Rare magic, the Retro magic, but the NX. Mhm. But I'll at this point, I'll just take anything from them. NX, when's it gonna happen to him? I don't know, man. Holy ****. It's like right, we're three days out from October right now.

Parker B says, hey guys, instead of some long crap, just want to say you guys are dope and what you do is awesome. I watched some multiplayer footage from the Call of Duty XP event and honestly, it looks like Black Ops 3 DLC with a new color scheme. Damn, I think Call of Duty should take it back a few notches like Battlefield 1. What do you guys think? What's your opinion on where they're taking things? What would you like to see them do? Keep it classy. I think they got to go back to World War II, but I think that um and I would love to see that, but I think that they're scared of doing that because their competition is doing that um with World War I and has a more recent uh and I'm talking about Battlefield, but has a more",

Call of Duty's going in the opposite direction, which I think is probably why is because it differentiates them. They're going into the future. Um, but I would love I would love and I would hope that Call of Duty, considering that, you know, Activision has recently doubled down saying Call of Duty is not going anywhere, um that I I hope that one of the three studios that's cycling between the franchisees working on a World War II game because I think that we we can go back to that point now and I think have a fresh experience again. I do agree that first of all, the franchise hasn't been to World War II since World at War and so that was a long time ago. And um we just",

We I mean, I understand why people were tired of it, but it's still it's still a it is still the conflict rife for storytelling and it can be done in beautiful and amazing ways with the new technology that we have. We have not seen anyone take advantage of that yet in a meaningful way. We're going to get things like The Sniper Elite game and stuff like that that's in World War II, but which looks great and it is great. I played it at E3, but um yeah, I I I want them to go backwards. Yeah, and I think that I was surprised that DICE went all the way back to World War I. I think that's as far back as you can go.

Like like I I know history like pretty well and these things all existed. Yes, the Zeppelin existed and these, but I'm like, this this **** this is **** chaos, you know, like and and World War I is chaos, but not in not in that way. So um so I I think World War II is one of those where you can marry that **** frenetic nonsense in the world in multiplayer maps and actually make it make sense because it really was like that.

Uh the Call of Duty story like the E3 trailer, I was like, man, this gameplay looks kind of awesome. See, that's my thing is like what I I'm fine with what Call of Duty's strat or pace is, right? Not being a Call of Duty fanboy or anything like that, not caring. I still want to play that Kevin Spacey version. I haven't jumped into that one.

You dock with your ship, you talk to what's happening there. You go, it's all one. There's no cuts, there's no stopping, there's no I mean, obviously they're hiding loads as you fly or whatever. But the idea is that you're playing this like a movie where there isn't going to be the hard stop and the loading spin and this is what's happening.

So I am interested in that story more than I am in the vignettes, but I haven't seen the story trailer. Yeah, I'm really interested to see the reviews of of both the games, just see kind of how they how they do and, you know, if it's worth the the time to to commit to it or whatever from a single player perspective. Well, Call of Duty is like a master class of of control and gameplay. And so I think that that's always going to be their advantage. It's not say Battlefield doesn't play well as well as well because it does.

Long time, first time. In recent years, there's been an anti-pre-order movement spurred on by a portion of the market and gaming personalities. I see the points to both sides of the controversy. First, I can understand publishers getting sight of their early sales numbers and then putting less effort into developing a quality product. On the other side, pre-ordering the hard pre-ordering hard to get items like the Wii U GamePad can make for a much easier purchasing process for individuals. My question is, could you gentlemen please discuss the positives and negative effects of pre-ordering games and what it does to our industry and your opinions on pre-ordering?

Although I agree with you, publishers aren't making making I don't think development choices based on pre-order six months out when the game has been developing two years. It's it's a gestation period. Um, my uh take on this is I think it's good to reserve and pre-order hardware. And I think that when he brought up the battery, that's nobody's argued that either. Yeah, like hardware is fine. We have pre-orders on VR and and all those kinds of things. I'm sure people have their Neo VR or the Neo pre-orders in. And I think that that's totally fine.

I guess I'm one of those gaming personalities and quotes that doesn't understand why people pre-order games otherwise. I think that there's interesting financial benefits now with Best Buy and Amazon giving pretty significant discounts on doing that. And I think that is a response to the stunting of um the pre-order market. But I don't don't understand how it, especially in the digital atmosphere, how it hurts to just wait until reviews come out or just wait until embargo lift and see what people think about the game or watch some gameplay or get some feedback from your friends. If you've waited um and I I guess it's easy for us to say because of the Early Access we get the games. And I understand that. So I'm putting that on the table.
