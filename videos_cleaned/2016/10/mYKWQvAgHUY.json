Colin, what's your top? Well, it goes into what you're saying a little bit with what you were touching on, which is time management. I've been really struggling with it lately. Uh, I, I, I, I really, I feel like time is our, our greatest like asset, um, in a lot of ways as humans and, and, and just kind of people because it's within that the confines of the time you have when you're not sleeping or doing something that you can do the things you enjoy and the things you love. And so, um, I've been really kind of struggling with, uh, getting everything done that I want to get done, done and doing the things that I want to do and trying to find also, you know, maintain my life work balance, maintain a, a like a relationship that's very important to me, talk to my family and hang out with my friends and then do all the kind of things that I want",

And what I found is that like I'm just doing, I'm, I'm almost not satisfied in any way with like, with, uh, the way I'm spending my time. Like, um, and I was curious if you guys have similar thoughts or anecdotes or how you, how you spend your time because like I feel like I look at my schedule. I want to read. I, I miss reading. I don't read almost anymore at all. Yeah, like, but I read the internet. I read, you know, blogs and websites or politics and sports and stuff, but I don't like sit down and read books anymore. I don't have enough time to like really sit and listen to music anymore. I, I, my, my backlog of games is absurd. Like, you know, people bust my balls sometimes say like you have all these half finished games on, on your and I'm like, I don't know what to do. Like, you know, I like what I do. I have access to",

Um, I want to like at least try them and see what, what brings me in. Um, and so I, I'm just curious how you guys, because I just feel like I don't have any time and I don't know if you guys, if you guys feel the same. Super limited for sure. I think that's what, yeah, what I was talking about before, yeah, where it is. I'd love to do every podcast I get asked to do and love to see every friend who's visiting or go to every Grimecraft music event and there's like f***ing 30 a day. I don't know how he does it, but like you can't, it's VR. Yeah, you can't. Yeah, you have to pick and choose, you know what I mean? And that's the big thing it comes down to in terms of me.

I think you have to really just pick. I would start with one thing that you're missing and then prioritize that and then build from there. The reading thing I totally get. And so I decided that when I got busy, I was going to make it a habit to read every night before bed. So every night when I get into bed, I pick up the book on my bedside table and I read for at least 10 minutes. Sometimes if I'm in a really good section or if I'm not super sleepy, I'll read for an hour or more. But I read every night and I always have it there, so it's always convenient. And I now that I have that as a routine, I do it all the time. And I even bring my books with me on the road and I read in bed at hotels as well. Yeah, reading is one of those things that's definitely missing for me. I used to, I used to be a voracious reader. Like I love, I love to read, um,",

You know, I just like random things. I'm just like, I look, I, I, I use my Kindle or my iPad and I have like, I literally just download books all the time, like buy books constantly. And then I'm like, and you can go and see how far along you are all them. It's a little blue meter. And I'm like, man, what am I doing? And then I look at my, my shelf of games or my library. I have hundreds of PS4 games. Mhm. And I'm like, I don't have time to play you, you know. And, uh, and then I look at, you know, my, my music collection or Spotify, whatever.

Um, I think some it comes down to though, finding what you're passionate about in that moment though, right? Like that's been a big thing for me in terms of trying to figure it out and how to spend free time is the fact of like some days I come home and yeah, I want to catch up on everything that's happened in Saga or I'm going to start Deadly Class. I'm going to read through that. And I pick up those book. I download comics with you, but the books right where I have just a Comics page stacked with stuff that I'm not dying to get to, right? Like I had so Brian K. Vaughan, right? You told me about Private Eye. And then when he did the, uh, Walking Dead, uh, like solo thing, right? Went and read the Walking Dead solo thing for free.

PDFs though, going then into Apple, whatever, bookshelf and all that crap, whatever. And so then when I was downstairs, uh, that was like probably six months, nine months ago. Mhm. When I was downstairs at a Comics Outpost or whatever, I saw it on the shelf as a hard cover and just bought it there again, right? Cause then I'll read that eventually, but it's not like I'm anxious dying to get it cause I come home and like, uh, last night Jen was like, uh, let's make dinner and then we'll watch something, right? And she'd been watching Luke Cage all day. And, and I was like, I kind of dropped out after episode one in the middle of episode one. I know I'll get back to it eventually.

And then when it was good, watched a few episodes of that. And then it was like, I want to play a game or whatever. So then it was like, I'm going to jump into Tomb Raider. And then I was like, you know what though? That Virginia everybody keeps talking about that sounds better for right now. Downloaded that, played that. It's like not being afraid to jump around. I guess not being ashamed to jump around is the other thing either where it's like, yeah, you know, I, I powered through on that plane ride from Chicago, Deadly Class Volume One. Then I bought Volume Two. And I'm, I'm maybe to the through the first two issues of that trade. And then put it down. And I'm into something else. And I'll",

You know what I mean? And I think that's something people have talked about on the forums. Uh, not people, but in one thread, one guy was like, hey, you know, Colin and Greg need to play more games. They're not, uh, they're not, they're not passionate about anything right now. And they're like, they're bringing up AAA releases. And I was like, no, no, no, you're missing the point. If you want the AAA coverage, there's other sites that do that fine. We're going to talk about what we care about.

I think you also have to schedule it. It's something now that we are so focused on, you know, the connectivity of our devices that if we don't put something in a calendar, it's almost like we forget to do it. Having that constant reminder of like, oh, well, at 5:00 every Wednesday, I'm going to sit down for an hour and work on my like cross-stitch project or I'm going to try a new album from this hour. And it doesn't really matter what it is you do in that time, but I find that it helps if you actually put it in your calendar and then you get a reminder about it so you don't schedule anything else",

And I have found that that's actually incredibly successful for me. Absolutely. I think that that is, that's the key. It's scheduling things out and it's actual time management. The secret to it is just managing your time. It's like that simple. But like that is a process that requires time. And I think that's the hardest, um, part to solve with this whole thing cause I feel like I'm really bad at it overall. And there's so many things I want to do, especially when it comes to Kinda Funny. It's like I don't, I don't do any of the things I want to do, but I'm so busy doing the",

And it's like that is where it gets really hard for me sometimes where I'm like, oh, when am I going to get to do the thing that I, I want to do? But it's like the more that we structure things, the more things that we put on a calendar. And it's a combination of putting these on a calendar and what you're talking about, just rituals. So it's like for me, it's become a ritual to walk to Starbucks with Nick and we use that time to discuss things that we want to talk about, like the projects we want to work on. And it's like that, even though it's not on the calendar, that is, it's a scheduled ritual for us. So it's like those are the, the types of things where I think that it, it really",

But it's, it gets hard. But looking, I use my calendar and I realized that the more I got rid of my personal calendar and I just use the Kinda Funny calendar as my personal calendar. And I think that it helps me because I think of even my private stuff as just things I have to do. Yeah, I have a dinner this night. I always look at my calendar so I know not to to f*** around before or after that. Like that time needs to be designated for that. I feel like if I don't do that, I forget about.

But if it was on the schedule, it's like I'm looking forward to it in a different way. No, 100%. And that, that's the problem that I was doing that for a while too, where I was like, all right, cool. Like I forgot this is a while ago when I was trying to figure this out when we were dealing with all this stuff is just like, you know, Mondays, video games from this to that. And then Tuesdays this, comics on Wednesday. You know what I mean? Try to actually diversify and put stuff down.

I'm not going to go out to this thing. No, I'm okay. Thank you. It's not that I don't care about you. It's just that this needs to happen. This is what has to happen right now. Yeah, I think that's, uh, I think that's a much more important thing than some people realize. And I think as we get older, we're more comfortable saying no because we settle more into a routine. We settle more into a group of friends. Friends, there's never this constant need to be like, oh, I need to go meet new people and always be networking and always finding out like who's moving and shaking, who's doing what.

And you know, as people who travel as much as we do, we don't get that time very often. And like the power to say no is so hard but so necessary. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And I feel like, you know, Sundays during football season, you know, I'm obsessed with football as and you football too. I always carved out for many years like Sunday and then Monday night, Thursday night is like times where I'm like, these are my, my times. And what I've actually been doing this season because the, the Prime Time games f***ing suck this year is that like the for the most part is that I used to just sit there and watch them anyway and maybe play beer or be on my laptop, whatever.

Like I don't need to sit here and watch this. And, uh, uh, you know, so, um, yeah, I'm trying to be more cognizant of that as well. But yeah, time, time is our greatest currency. And so I feel like, I feel like I need, you know, I'm, I'm a great multitasker. I'm great at like getting things done. And I'm great at like facilitating this free time.

So that's, that's a big thing too where I feel like, you know, it's, um, you guys go to more events and stuff like that. And I'm like, I can't. I feel bad because the fans want to hang out and do all those kinds of things. And I want to meet them when we do our meet and greets and stuff like that. But, um, I'm also at the point in my life where I'm like, I got to like carve as much time out as possible. I can't, I can't give everything to everyone, you know?

And I feel like the, my message to the younger people out there, the people that don't have full-time jobs yet or in college or whatever at home still is like, man, eat that sh*t up while you can. Cause like I remember having too much free time at some point in my life, right? Even in college, I worked two jobs and had classes and I still felt like after six every day, I was like, I don't know what the f*** I'm supposed to do, you know? And I just, it was great.

Anything you possibly want, whether it's a show, a book, a movie, a game, it's all right there. And so like, there's just too much to engage in to begin with, let alone to be bored with it. Absolutely. I will say, uh, back to my point about you should spend the time to manage your time. I think that anytime I've done that, it's always been worth it. Like no matter how long it takes, no matter how frustrating it is. And it's always the last thing you want to do cause you get always be doing those things that you want to do and skip the step.

Then from 1:30 to 1:00, we're going to do a stream. Then from this time to this time, there's, there's a podcast and who's on what changes and all this. So it's like, oh, that's not that bad. But the problem is in between all that, whoever's not on needs to plan for the next thing. And like, oh, Colin needs to do tweets. And oh, I need to make sure that Colin does the tweets.

Well, that's the only thing when we were, I mean, we still do it, but not to as the crazy extent as we did where we would plan so much in a day and it would look totally manageable. But and we're talking about the, the old apartment, right? Of not budgeting the 30 to 45 minutes for Kevin to flip the room, right? Where it was like, you do one thing and then we were off track so far behind schedule and everybody's mad and everybody's frustrated and in, you know, inevitably something doesn't work in there.
