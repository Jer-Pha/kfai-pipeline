This is Greg Miller and today we're playing Batman: Arkham VR on our PlayStation VR unit. Uh it's worth noting that Sony provided both the unit and the game but not the PlayStation Move controllers which are your very own. These are my own that I bought off Amazon. They provided everything else for review but you can take it with a grain of salt. Hey. Whoa. That's scary. Don't do that. I can't see that coming. All right. So Batman: Arkham VR is to me from what I've played and what I've seen one of the premier sort of experiences on PlayStation VR up there with EVE: Valkyrie and a few others. I agree 100% with you Colin. So we thought we would give you a little taste of it. So what are we going to do today Greg as you're moving about standing of course on the roof of GCPD. That's pretty cool. We're going to jump in. We're going to play not from the very beginning. The origin had been hidden. I had",

So uh the Riddler trophies and stuff are now enabled. And I there's two or I think it was two or three up there. It said for Manor. I think I know where they are. Did you go around Manor and like jump around and do some of the puzzles and stuff? No. I mean I looked around on the globe, spin the globe, but I didn't know that there was anything to see otherwise. Yeah. Over at this over when I was playing the first time you go over to this giant uh map section. And when I went there I saw the buildings and I started putting them in.

You're looking at me. No that's Alfred over there. You see my hands bruised and knuckle. Uh all so worth noting two things of course, right, Colin. Uh number one, uh that your the quality of this video is going to look worse than it does on the VR headset. Mainly because the PlayStation having to render it down, the TV image isn't as up to speed as what the the headset is. You know what I mean? It is worth worth noting that the resolution in the headset's not also not a great Yeah. No, no. Yeah, for sure. It's not like I'm not looking around at like, you know, the best thing in the world.

I'll remember the other one later. I got to take this key from Alfred of course. Sorry about that. Oh, and the other thing is that that's what it was going to be. So resolution on your thing, as we say in the description, not that great. And then also, I've noticed my hands are wigging out a bit. I think it's because we have giant lights on me and I got a green screen behind me. This didn't happen when I was playing it.

Hey, Alfred, **** you. Now, one of the cool things I like about this area too, and we've seen in other parts of the game, is it's not necessarily a unique or novel solution to locomotion in VR, but it's it's a solution, which is you just which is just kind of teleporting to different parts as opposed to, you know, the you need the Move controllers to have the adequate experience.

I was hoping How did the Riddler get into Wayne Manor? You know what? I'd rather not know if I'm being honest. Uh I was playing That's one of the big things I think that we all have to get used to with playing it, right? Is that like the teleporting right now around is an easy way to move and not get sick cuz like right now this is all I'm in control. Great. But when there's another game I've been playing where you walk around in first person and that's a little jarring of like having it from the you know full on it.

Yeah, that's a good solution. Might be a little weird at first. You have to unlearn how to use the camera. Exactly. Well, that's the whole thing you you and I talk about VR all the time, right? That we have to get used to playing games a different way. We have to relearn how to play games. No, I got to show something else. But I want you to do that and then watch this. I got over here. See this popped up? And guess what this is? It's talking about what's happening with LexCorp taking over Gotham. Huh? Are you happy we saw this? Look at this graph thing over here.

Uh I wanted to jump around a little bit and play with a couple other things and my time really was limited this weekend with unfortunately, but um yeah, I think it's I think it's the most out of the the the experiences that I've had over the years, over the few years that we've had with Oculus Vive and with PSVR now. This is definitely up there with EVE: Valkyrie as a AAA to me kind of experience uh that is not going to be very long. We we we we had the news at at E3 and and and people have been talking about it.

Actually, but some people, VR is fun. That was really uh terrifying. But I think that I think this is really cool. This is a nice sign of imagine if this was a 10-hour experience. Yeah. No, totally. It would be very hard to make. I'm sure about 70 people worked on this game from Rocksteady. So, right. No. Well, that's what's been so cool to see people uh working on something that's different. When they of course when they announced this at E3, I flipped that and I was like, \"Oh my gosh, Mark Hamill, this is going to be great.\" D and I was like, \"Wait, you know what? Wait a second. This is probably going to suck, right?\" Like, this isn't this is going to be a short experience. This is going to be like seconds, 10 minutes long. And then you play when I got",

This all makes sense. And I don't we're not going to play the whole thing. Obviously, I don't want to ruin it for you. I don't want to ruin the the surprises and twists and turns in it, but everything you do with this makes sense and it's fun. Like, right, it's easy to understand how you're supposed to do all this stuff and how it's going to work together. And it's a little forgiving, too. Like, you're hurling the Batarang or whatever, but you're not it's not like pinpoint accurate. You're just kind of throwing it. It kind of arcs in as you see. Yeah.

There's a trophy attached to one of the I thought it sounded so easy and then I tried to get it and I screwed it up like god damn it. Yeah. So, it's worth noting this this uh particular game unlike a lot of the PSVR games that we have or that have been popping on PSN profiles and the like an Exophase. Uh this doesn't have a platinum trophy. I but I don't think it does suck. The game's an hour long. But I like but I mean that is 90 minutes to go back and get some of these. Like right there that's a Riddler thing, right? I just went to buy it for the first time. I should have shot it and done something, but I'm learning as I play.

I I think that uh I think the experience is is really pretty. Uh looks good. Well, I mean it's a real Rocksteady game, you know what I You talk about 70 people and that's what I talk about it when I walked in that demo E3 where I was expecting to get like oh this is going to be some farmed out thing and that you know it was it was Sefton and it was Dax and I was like oh okay over there Tannosaurus I will say out of the out of the three games on PSVR that that since we've had it that I've spent any amount of time with Yeah, which is this uh Job Simulator and Until Dawn.

I think this experience was perfectly smooth as well, especially because it's not active in in Job Simulator, you kind of have to move and do things quickly.
