So Tetris is a good example, like Tetris is almost out of the box a pure game of skill, like almost a pure game of skill. Legally, the only thing that's random about Tetris is the block drop. So you play in your Marathon mode and the order in which the blocks drop down is random in a normal game of Tetris.
