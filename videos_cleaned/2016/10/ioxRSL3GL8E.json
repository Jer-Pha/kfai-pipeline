Tim, yeah, what's your topic? Um, my topic I mentioned earlier, it's Kazaa and Napster and LimeWire and all of these peer-to-peer uh networks that we used to use. Um, I was thinking about this because I came across a screenshot for LimeWire and it instantly just gave me all these flashbacks of downloading all types of stuff and that was, you know, I started with Napster, moved on to Kazaa, eventually LimeWire, eventually FrostWire, then eventually Torrents. Give me a timeline, give me a timeline here. Timeline, yeah, Napster, 2000. Okay, was I still kicking by then? Cuz I thought Napster got neutered by then.

Yeah, Napster invented at Northeastern University. Here we go. Uh, yeah, I I started using it in '99. By 2000, it was uh probably dying cuz what happened is for me when I went to college and first Ethernet port and had a laptop, jumped on and yeah, Napster had been handicapped by then. I thought, and this would be 2001, fall of 2001. Over, I jump, I jumped to LimeWire and then ran LimeWire through all freshman year. I'm pretty sure Napster didn't go dead dead. It wasn't dead, it just it wasn't as good as like when we were in high school and I had 56k. It was like, dude, it was like the Wild West in 1999. It was insane. I mean, I think that that lasted a little bit longer than I feel like in 2001. It was still doing that. I think even 2002, like I think it wasn't until like 2003.

So yeah, maybe it was a little earlier than 2000. So I started in like sixth grade. Is so that would have been 2001, I guess. So then that whole period I used Napster and then yeah, died and then we moved on to Kazaa. It was like the intermediary and that didn't last too long. Um, but that was when movies got introduced or not so much movies but videos got introduced. Um, and then LimeWire was just the natural extension and FrostWire after that and whatever. Then Torrents were like, all right, we've perfected this art. Um, but man, I mean that stuff totally defined so much of my life and my tastes to this day. Uh, but just looking at the LimeWire image, there was just so many things. I'm like, oh my God, I remember downloading this thing or this",

And just so much little shit specifically using LimeWire to download LimeWire Pro and like feeling like I just shit broke the system and it was like I was the coolest dude. Downloaded my um, what was it? WinMX. Yeah, WinMX was the one I used. That's was that's why I was like racking my brain. I was like, what was the last one I used? And it was WinMX, which was like a really was actually really good. Yeah, and Soulseek is another one that Soulseek was a bit more of the obscure shit. You can find that real high quality like good shit if you're looking. Um, and everyone, what was the media player that uh Winamp with the fucking llama demo thing like really whips the llama's ass?

If you see Linkin Park.exe, you're doing it wrong. That's you're going to have a bad time. But if you find Z MP3s, you're great, you know? And uh that's the thing I think about all the time is that the fact it never went wrong for me that I was so stupid and I never downloaded something that totally infected my computer and crashed my computer and Trojaned me or anything like that. Cuz I was I didn't know what I was doing. I got there Ethernet, great. I remember like worrying about if if uh what was it that this the the difference between I guess the cable I had if this was an Ethernet cable or whatever if it would plug in Ethernet jack and all dumb stuff.

I was so to that like because it was mystifying to have amazing internet that just wasn't a thing yet. And then to get there and go and I remember like for me like LimeWire, I think of um uh Chatterbox, GTA III came out. I was the only person with the PS2. We would sit there, people would come in and out. I'd be playing, they'd get mad at me when I got out of the car cuz I just want to listen to Chatterbox. So me and a friend, I would leave my computer on 24 hours, 7 days a week searching on Wire for Chatterbox. And one morning I woke up and had an hour-long track that it finally got uploaded. We got it and we were so blown away to have it. And then like downloading songs and putting them on, you know, burning them to CDs and then go walking on my way to class and listening and find out it was the clean version or there",

Um no no no no what's the uh the All the Things She Said? All the Things She Said. Yeah, I got that and I will never whenever I oh my God whenever I think about that God I love that we both downloaded the same whenever I think about that song there's a part where like the door closes from a bu somebody totally bootlegged off their like you and I had the exact same. So like when I I never hear that song but when I do hear that song I'm always waiting for like noise that MP3 that not necessarily tattoo but yeah with all the weird ambient noise from your computer. Yeah, God funny as hell. It was the Wild West. I mean Napster um Napster is an inter was an interesting uh thing. Um what was that guy's name? Shawn Fanning I think was his name.

Sean Parker. Um is that what it is? I don't think you guys are right. I yeah look into that. Uh you could be but uh when that was invented uh at uh and you or whatever like that was Shawn Fanning. Yeah, and there is a Sean Parker. There's there's Shawn Fanning, Sean Parker. Fanning, Sean Parker looks to be the one who's getting the credit. Um so when that like when that came about it was really remarkable. I had at the time like a 366 modem or something like that. Um and I would download you know songs or whatever.

I cuz I was downloading you would like people I'm sure people remember this you can go to websites and download MP3s like right click and like save as like MP3s and that's like '96, '97. Like that's how you kind of do it. And then uh Napster came around and we did it. I I remember when my friend Cody got high-speed internet in 2000. Um he was like, dude, you have got to see Napster on this. Like it's ridiculous. I would I had my own phone line in my room and I would download. I actually I only had like a gig and a half on my computer of space so I couldn't download like everything and I had I still bought a lot of CDs.

And we would I would remember just I remember going I already had it but I remember looking for 311's Sound System which had just come out and uh all the distracts are there. And I remember just downloading them all and it would be like and the bar would just fill for each of them or whatever. This is unbelievable. I can't believe that with cable internet can do this. Um and then we'd burn them to data CDs or whatever and and dat and then dist and distribute them or whatever. But uh then I moved on to I didn't really use uh Soulseek or LimeWire. I moved on to WinMX. Uh and I really stopped using this stuff in like 2002. Uh I think a lot of colleges you guys",

Uh I think a lot of colleges you guys probably had the same thing. There was a thing called DC++. Um that was a peer-to-peer network that was uh usable. I I I don't really know much about it but most usable over T1 lines. So when I was at Northeastern or whatever it would basically connect everyone's computers and people would share their shit that way. Um it could couldn't be used outside of that network but the speeds were ridiculous. So that's when people were downloading like Seinfeld episodes and movies and all sort of stuff. And I was like, uh I wasn't really into any of that kind of stuff like doing that kind of stuff. So I would just download some music here and there in like 2003 or so. But then like my buddies had CDs and I would just rip their CDs or whatever and do all that kind of stuff. And then by like 2004 or so I was",

And then not too long after that like YouTube was like you could just go listen to anything you wanted on YouTube as long as you had like, you know, your on your computer or something like that. And I had my my iPod and I'd buy music or whatever. And and um yeah, you know, I kind of felt like a little sketchy about it like like as I when I understood in 10th Grade when I was using Napster, I'm like, I I'm broke. I don't really know what the fuck I'm even doing. This has no like ramifications. It was actually when when Napster was taken like taken down and like attacked where I'm like, yeah, I kind of understand where these people are coming from. Like this is kind of fucked up.

Like this is, you know, not that I was buying music left and right. I wasn't. I just was I was buying CDs still like a few a year and then just ripping them in my computer and then listening to YouTube. And then 2007, 2008, then I was I was using um Pandora and now I'm on Spotify. So I just I I'm more comfortable paying for this kind of stuff. And it seems like Torrents have taken that over. I don't have any experience with that that world at all like going to the Pirate Bay or whatever the fuck people go do. I don't know how to even do it.

Whereas you kind of can there like back then your local record store had like a poster up saying like don't download songs come in here and do it. Like even as part of like Kazaa and LimeWire, there was like all those anti-Metallica SWF files, right? Like saying like fuck you Lars Ulrich and like all this sort of stuff. Yeah, but like he was like that was the thing was like he was Lars Ulrich was right though. Like maybe not maybe not the way he was saying it. But I was just like, I kind of understand the message. Like these guys make their music and they want to sell it. The ironic thing is that a lot of these bands, you know, bands don't really make money on music. They make it on touring, which is why I think that's spot and merch, which is why I think Spotify is nice. And I would pay way more for Spotify if they",

I think it's and at the time I thought that he was being like super contrarian to being like, oh, you made your money already. And actually like when I look back at it now, I'm like, oh, actually yeah, you had made your money and you were probably doing this for everyone else who was coming down the road. Like all the other bands that weren't maybe going to get that little like Taylor Swift with Spotify, right? Like where she makes the stand. Then Apple Music the same way. Like she doesn't need the money but she can make the stand for the only album I own on Apple on that I bought is is her album cuz I was like, yeah, I'm not going to get it that way. Exactly.

But I thought I think I remember when I was in freshman year using LimeWire, downloading that stuff and that being the time that iTunes got announced and they started talking about that's what they're going to do and they're going to charge for music this that the other. And being like, and my my thought was, no way. Like I'm going to buy if I'm paying for music, I'm going to get the CD. And that's what happened is, you know, freshman year ended and I moved, you know, out into housing. And for some reason it just didn't I didn't care I guess that much about LimeWiring anymore. And I'd go out and buy CDs and, you know, borrow other people's CDs and burn what I wanted off. Well, there's a big educational shift there. I think that uh, you know, everybody that grew up",

So once it made that shift to Torrents, which was probably around 2005, I would say is when it like really started. Half-Life 2 came out in 2004 and that was huge. That was like the the torrent. Exactly. And there there's a whole bunch of uh I mean LimeWire and FrostWire and Soulseek and all this stuff. They still existed. Like I mean they still to this day um exist or at least Soulseek does.

But it's like he was just that was a little high school hustle, right? So like whatever. Um but once I learned how to torrent and started teaching my friends stuff, then all of a sudden became like a word of mouth thing where everyone around was like, oh cool, like this is how you do it. Then it's like it separates you from everybody else. And you knew how to do this stuff. All was it was like port forwarding.

Always have. I'm a big fan of supporting artists and stuff. And I think that as seen you buy CDs or buy physical media. I buy CDs, you're the I buy CDs, rip CDs. Like I am all about that shit.

And uh his basic thing is that, you know, not that I agree with his premise or whatever or anything, you know, a lot of what he was saying was interesting and some of I agree with, which was the idea of like these guys, guys, these these these environmentalists, even if the science says what it says, stand on their moral high ground and are like, we got to get rid of oil and we got to get rid of all these things. And um his whole argument is like, but they don't understand the severe ramifications of that when you don't have to worry about it.

And so we can buy everything we but when we were 14, we couldn't do that. And so it's easy for us like you were saying to stand on this moral high ground with thinking of the ramifications of everyone around you or how that those things might might affect it. That said like Dreamcast and PS1 were very easy to pirate games on. Like and and and a lot of us did it as a kid. I mean like I I've talked about in the past like dude I grew up playing Amiga games. Like the console that you never had to buy a game for. And the reason why there wasn't another Amiga like Commodore",

Or isn't going to buy the music any. They have no money. But maybe it gets it gets some interested in.

Dredg later on and all like, so is never would have come across if it wasn't for Kazaa, Limewire. Like Tool is another one like in a weird way, like very anti that kind of stuff too. That's so that's crazy because I think that the few years difference we have, like I sure I had some CDs and stuff, but it was like Britney Spears, you know what I mean? It was things that were just like the mainstream pop stuff, like me being uh in fourth grade or whatever.

Um, I think that the having Napster and being able to kind of find yourself, like to this day, every single artist I listen to, I would say that I like really truly believe in came from that. Um, that's so funny because I can't like the only thing I can think of is in that era, '99, '00, '01, when I'd go see a band or a B, like I'd see 311 a lot. So I a band open for them like Zebrahead or um, even Incubus, um, before they were big when S.C.I.E.N.C.E. was out. I I did download those, you know, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. was a record like a fan.

So it did it may have painted like my opinion of certain bands or certain things, whatever. But I never I never was to the point where I down I never downloaded a movie or anything like that because I don't think I even had the bandwidth to do those kinds of things then. And then I remember long after I was like, and then it started getting shady with like, are you getting viruses and all this? Like, and I was scared of that. And then in the mid-2000s, what telecoms and ISPs started going after people.

And it's funny because it he what had happened is I had gotten into Smallville late because of going to college or whatever. And so a friend of mine gave me burn DVDs or whatever I could put in the computer and watch there. And I liked it so much that I stopped and went and bought the DVDs. But the guy who gave him those turned out to be like one of the biggest pirates in in Missouri or whatever and like went to Federal everything in that level. But like I never did a movie. I've never pirated a game. Like I mean, POS brought games over back in the day and plugged in the floppies or whatever for us to play. But I never went out of my way to pirate a game.

But it's like that kind of made me learn the system. Now granted, we talk about you you can don't trade in games, right? Buy new. I was trading stuff in. That's how I kept my cycle going as a kid or a teen like that. I wanted to play other stuff. So I'm playing stuff as fast as I can to trade it in. The system the system allows for that. What I've said before is that I'm not I would never cast a personal judgment of someone pirating even, you know, our exclusive podcast or something. If that's what you like, it's like it is what it is.

And whether you can justify it or find some moral high ground or whatever in there, I don't know. But I like I don't it's not really it seems like a dead issue to me because what really what really nullified it, like I said, was was ultimately Pandora and then especially Spotify. But actually YouTube was really what nullified it for me in college. Like I could people are just uploading everything to there. Every album. Yeah. And I was just like, fine.

I mean, it's there's still the YouTube unofficial stuff is illegal. If you're listening to that, it's illegal world. Now that stuff is at least monetized for those people, even if it's barely, right? Exactly. And they have whatever the um, uh, I can't think about the the the music video like kind of sub thing that's Vevo. Yeah. And all that kind of stuff. So they've tried to protect their artist and stuff like that. But um, yeah, I've like I've often had that conundrum where I'm like, it's it's a victimless crime. But is it a victimless crime?

And so I I like that there's solutions that, you know, Apple's ingenuity for some started with or renewed ingenuity started with iMac for some and with iPod for some. But I think it started with iTunes. And like the the cuz iPod came out first. And I I I when iTunes hit, I'm like, yeah, you guys understand exactly. And then they they changed the marketplace forever. And that's still the way the market exists to this day, which I think is remarkable. And once they make it easier and so it's all about ease and then extracting money in ways that you don't think about it. I was just looking at my bank statement today and it's like $8.99 Showtime.

So I guess you're going to just extract so I can watch **** The Circus every week, you know what I mean? So it's like, yeah, probably. But it's it's so it's it, you know, and so Spotify is the same way. But often said that I think that Spotify um is worth more and I think they're eventually going to have to charge more as well. They also need to give their artists a lot more money than they are. Well, that's what I'm saying. Like I would gladly if there were some sort of premium premium premium thing. I don't even know what it would look like because there's really just a premium account um that you pay $10 or whatever it is for.

Like I can't I can't believe when I when I when I started using it, I started using it very early and and started paying for it very early when around the time it came out because I was like, this is this can't possibly exist forever.
