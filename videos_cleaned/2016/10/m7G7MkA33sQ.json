So they decided, whatever, we're just going to start our own watch company. That's kind of like us. We're like, you know what, we see all these other people making YouTube videos, we can do it too. Let's start Kinda Funny. MVMT Watches start at just $95. At a department store, you're looking at hundreds of dollars to get a watch. I remember one time me and Nick Scarpino went to uh that there Nordstrom's trying to get me a watch. Yeah, let me tell you, it was cool but it was expensive. Here, MVMT Watches, they figured out that by selling online, they're able to cut out the middleman and retail markup, providing the best possible price, classic design, quality construction, and style minimalism. We just got a bunch of them. Colin got a black and blue one, Nick got this real sleek one, and Greg Greg got a fancy red and",

I talked about a little bit on PS I Love You. I went through with the man, the myth, the legend, Po. Went to Chicago this weekend, bought him a PlayStation 4 Slim, housewarming gift, birthday gift, overdue if you ask me. Uh, and then immediately downloaded Overcooked, downloaded my save. We went back at it because you remember when Po was out here visiting for the Weezer concert, we were we were balls deep, as Colin Moriarty would say, in Overcooked and having a great time. We were getting really, really good at it. And then he left and I'm not going to play alone. I didn't want to cheat on him with somebody else. I kept the save in pristine shape.

Now I'm short, I think I counted out six or eight uh courses for the perfect three stars. Once I get those, which my boy Colin Moriarty has agreed to help me with, once I get those, I get the gold trophy, 100% Overcooked trophies. Damn, that's what, that's how you do it. I'm excited. Now, Colin, how confident are you in getting these three stars with me? I'm not confident at all because you you you not even confident I'm going to play with you. You've been held down by someone we'll call Aaron. She's been an anchor on you in terms of how how hard, how high you could fly and it Overcooked, because the game brings out visceral anger.

You're trying to get these three stars. That's the kind of fire I needed or something. **** onions. But you haven't been the glacier levels yet with the ice skating and stuff. Tell me, how many how many fish have you fried? What is the fish and chip situation on your dire, dire fish and chip situation? I haven't gotten that far. I know that I don't move on until I get three stars. Your that's your huge blunder. I've done seven or eight stages. Hug. Because I we needed Po and I needed to finish the marathon.

Came back from my Overcooked hiatus, dominated Overcooked, excited to finish this off soon. Last night, jumped in, did Batman Episode One because I needed to do my save. I've played Episode One, obviously. I I host The Telltale Show. Again, take what I take what the grain of salt, they don't pay me. But I I host The Telltale Show, did Episode One as a crowd play at Comic-Con. Had a good time. Uh, but then I never had my my canonical save, you know what I mean? **** is a crowd play? Crowd play. We we went so Comic-Con sometimes Telltale debut new when Greg does a let's play at of meet and greet. Oh, okay. It's actually a really good, well done there.

Then I finally played Episode Two of Batman: The Telltale Series. Blown away. I like Telltale Episode One. I enjoyed, obviously. But then replay, replaying any Telltale Game, I'm always like, all right, like, oh, this is what's coming. This, oh, I forgot this part. Okay, blah, blah, blah, blah. There were also, of course, it's a Telltale Game on a console. There were all these like, everybody had an echo at one point. Like, they were talking in a cave. I was like, what the hell's going on?

It was shorter than others, but super enjoyable. Awesome choice at the end that like, it was that thing where when I tweeted about like the bar fight was awesome. That's not spoiler, don't worry. Somebody was all crybaby about that last night. Bar fight was awesome. And then it was like, and what a great final choice. Everybody like, all my responses were asking me which I chose. And that I think that's a great sign of like how that's going to shake out. Awesome. Yeah, then I played some Hot Shots Tennis as well last night. We'll talk about that shortly, Greg.

Came out in Japan June 3rd earlier that year. Now it's one of those consoles where a lot of people have really, really, really fun memories of like Greg Miller. Um, and then there's a lot of people that I think kind of pick on the console a little bit too much where it's fantastic. And comparing it, the fun machine, it was the fun machine.

And like, yeah, some of the games were 40, some of the games were like 70. And it's just crazy. There was such a range. And like, that's half the console if you're if you're getting some of the the like the the latest WWE game was like super or WWF was uh expensive. Yeah, but it was worth it. But yeah, so I was kind of looking into it and like reading through NeoGAF and looking at everyone's kind of memories and stuff. Were they haters or were they having fun with it?

She bought me a Sega Saturn. Almost drove me out of video games. Uh, and then eventually, yeah, went to high school. And when I went to high school, that was right as uh N64 was really hitting its stride in terms of multiplayer stuff that I would care about, right? Uh, I was just back into wrestling or getting back into wrestling when the Attitude Era was just starting. Uh, and they were had the, you know, WCW vs. NWO game was out.

Yeah, well, no, that's what it was though, is that I remember I those are intrinsically linked, sitting on my bed in my pajamas that I got, probably got for Christmas.

Like there's so many. Every game was thinking about multiplayer as like a the couch multiplayer experience, which back then was just that's what video games what were, you know. Yeah, I really like N64. Um, you know, it it was it was hard to live alongside uh PS1, I think, for it in some ways. And it certainly played second fiddle to a PS1 for me and a lot of other people.

Uh and um you know, for for all the things it did wrong or all the weird things that I think it did, the backwards kind of looking things that I think it did, the cartridges for instance, I think were a huge mistake. Um and lost them a lot of support from a lot of third parties. That's why you didn't have role playing games from Square on there. They why would they do that, you know? Um when they can put Final Fantasy VII to their vision on a few discs on, you know, would never fit on a cartridge unless the cartridge had a $500 chip in it or something like that.

So and I'm making that up, I don't know. Um but uh N64 had a great um you know, which I think is in contrasting the PS1. I they had a great first-party ecosystem. We weren't really worried or thinking too much about Sony own games or whatever. We looked at Sony games as things like Spyro and things like uh Crash. But these weren't even made by Sony own studios, nor were they published by Sony. So it's like we ecosystem didn't really exist in the way we know it now until really the PS2 ever started getting going. They had Japan Studio and all these kinds of things and Polyphony making games. But that wasn't really the the the the onus on PS1 as it was on N64. So to me, N64 was a secondary console that I had sitting alongside my PS1 on myself, sh. And when something came along that I wanted to play, I played it on N64. But most",
