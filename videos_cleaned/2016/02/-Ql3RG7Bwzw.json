Tim, yes, what's your topic? My topic is karaoke. Oh, yes. So there's a reason for this, and that reason is I just came from Philadelphia, which it's actually where the karaoke came from. That's what I heard, that's where it was invented. Well, every **** thing is the first thing in Philadelphia. It's like you could not walk a block, and I'm talking even in like the projects and the not really nice areas, without some plaque that's like, 'This is the first gutter that was ever made. This is the first bell. This is the first Dunkin' Donuts.' And it's just like, God damn, it's at least 100 years old. Yeah, at least.

It's like, it's this like, sorry, Kevin just looked at me when I said Mexican Face-Off. He looked at me like he's expecting me to do a version of Face-Off with a Mexican accent. And I really wanted to, but then he was like, he gave me the, 'Don't do a version of Face-Off.' Sure, sure, with the Mexican accent, it'll come off super racist. I apologize to him. It's fine.

That's not fun American karaoke. So then there's the, the fun American karaoke, which is like you go to a bar and then there's a stage, people go stage. I don't like that. I don't like that at all. It's, it's like it, it just, there's something about it that's just a little too presentational for me, which intimidating. Uh, it's not even that, that's not why I don't like it.

Darryl, talk about this in a minute. Greg Miller is the, the karaoke God because he knows every word to every song ever. And I think that is the key to karaoke. You can't be reading off the screen. You need to be freestyling. You need to be performing. Nothing is more impressive to a lady you're trying to court than if you are singing karaoke Taylor Swift and you turn your back to the monitor and sing it to her. That's the only way.

Now, this list is deep, so I don't understand what Colin's already hating on about it. It's, it's a karaoke, that's the problem. It's a karaoke song for every mood.

I want to give a shout out to the like 60-year-old Asian man that tried his best to sing 'My Heart Will Go On'. And it's like, I, I'm assuming he never heard the song before he did it because it was just a disaster in the most beautiful way. The thing about that song is it comes from a place of pure passion. Yeah, so you don't actually have to sing it to feel it, if you know what I mean. Oh, yeah. Nothing beats Celine, 'The King of Wishful Thinking'. Come on now, that is, that's a good song. 'The King of Wishful Thinking'. I'll get over you. 'Pretty Woman'. I know that's good song. There's this great breakdown. Even the 80s is great during 'I Never Shed a Tear for You'.

It's like people are, there are certain, they go 80s songs that will never go away. There is during every karaoke night, for instance, someone always plays Journey, and they either play it too early and just 'Don't Stop Believin'', right? Yeah, you can't play too early. Can't play too early. That's got to be everyone's got, no, don't pick that song. Drink one. No, come on, Journey, it's the obvious choice. Drink 14 ****, play some Journey right now. I need to sing to that. And you just see a, you'll look back if you're singing or if you're, you know, you're facing people and just to see if people exploding and the worst **** sound coming at you 'cause no one can sing Journey, no one can sing, but",

I'll tell you just as a quick thing, I will never forget Brendan singing 'Any Way You Want It', and I was like, holy ****, like that guy can sing, like really rock that song. His 'Dirty Pop' is my favorite by 'N Sync 'cause he does the whole choreograph dance from the video and like, oh, if you've seen R and IO, that's a special sight. Yeah, it really is. Keep going through this. All right, we got, you can move on everybody else's list. I'm just letting you know how serious I am. Some of these are works in progress.

Oh, yeah, Dashboard Confessional. Okay, but as for now, I love all the emo stuff. Come on, 'California' by Phantom Planet. I saw Phantom Planet in a play in a record store once. It was really weird. Was it in California? No, it was in Boston. Uh, probably 100 people. It was interesting when they played the song 'California', how did everyone get it? Did they know what 'California'? That's all I wanted to see. I think I might, that's what everybody wanted because I like, they just put out a new record. Doesn't matter. 'Teenage Dirtbag'. Yeah, Wheatus, the pride Long Island.

And by the second verse, you're like, 'I got nothing left in the tank.' That's why I started writing things down, right? 'Cause you get up there and because it's always, 'Oh, I know that song. I enjoy that song.' You get up there and then you learn, 'Oh, I don't know. Oh my God.' So my favorite thing was, uh, this group, it was like a bachelorette party, and one of them was like, 'Let's do, um, 'Always on Time' by Ashanti and Ja Rule.'

So this is the thing about, you know, Greg's, everyone can have their own list. It's totally fine. Yeah, there's a, that's a self-indulgent list. The art of karaoke is to make sure you're playing songs people around you actually give a **** about. If you're playing 'Teenage Dirtbag', which I appreciate because it is from a band from Long Island, and we all like that very much. We all love Long Island best.

Yeah, but so like my thing is like, 'cause I, I did a lot of karaoke in college especially, and then early on when I came here, I, I love karaoke. I think it's fun. But you like, you learn that quickly, like you have to do things that like people really know and like, like, like if you want to have a lot of fun.

How are you guys doing this? Or because it's not about like hitting all the register or whatever, it's about, you know, enjoying yourself. So karaoke like it makes everything sound good on the mic. At least, I don't know what magic it has, but it's like, well, they usually put the actual vocals behind you too. Well, that, but also they, they do some weird mixing thing that's like, man, like I don't sound like that. I know I don't sound like that. You think you sound good to the audience?

One of them is hit or miss, and that's 'Creep' by Radiohead. Like I love that song. Would you have to pull it out right after there was a like right after someone did 'Don't Stop Believin''? Mhm.
