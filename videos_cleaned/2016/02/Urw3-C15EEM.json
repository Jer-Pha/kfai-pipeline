Um, I was thinking, apologize, I'm going to go to the restroom. I was thinking about forms, okay, I was thinking about forms of entertainment and, uh, I identified like five forms of entertainment, five ways we like, we, we, uh, we consume media. Um, and I wanted to know what, like, how you would order them in terms of important, like your most important, the least important. You so that if like you can only really take one or two of them with you, which ones would you want? So there's only five that I can identify. We can get deeper into, but this is basically what I said. It's like reading, like books usually, right? Or like magazines or something like that. Watching TV or TV shows, uh-huh, watching movies, film, playing video games, and then listening to music or playing music, music of any variety, right? Gotcha. Do you want, do you want to write it down? Do you need to write it down? 'Cause I need to",

That could have taken out his eye, Kevin. Then who? We couldn't put him on camera anymore because you have no eye. Oh, I, yeah, give him a patch. Good call. Okay, take out his eye. All right, so for me, most important, I'm putting games at the top of the list. Okay, done. I'm going to do two, three, four, five. Done, dun, done. Now make here. So I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do that, and then I'm going to go, you know what, I can already tell you what my least important thing is, music. So I put that five. So there we go. Now we got TV, movies, and reading. This is where it gets interesting. Yeah. Okay, number two, most important, reading. So I can read Comics in the Internet. Yeah, does reading the Internet",

I don't think I would even count Comics in that either. Comics would be, I don't know what that would be. Uh, I was saying more like reading books, reading magazines, like read, like reading, we all read every day. I'm reading **** tape on my. So then, yeah, the Internet totally counts. You're going, telling me you're reading an article on the Internet and it's not as valuable as an article in a magazine? Okay, I mean, if that's the way you want to quantify it, yeah. Okay. And then, then I'm going to go TV for your Arrow, your Flash, your House of Cards, and then I'm going to put movies in there. So movies at four, just because I, the movies, I'm like, I'm looking forward to Batman v Superman, right? But I get",

So why I worry about it? Okay, so your order is video games most important, and then reading, and then TV, and then movies, and then music, right? Okay, what's yours, Tim? I go reading. If the, the Internet counts, the Internet counts. So, and yeah, definitely that. Then, then music for sure. Music would be my first if the Internet didn't count. Um, I'm adding Internet videos as a tier because I prefer that was put movies or TV to me. I, I put it there. Uh, then games, then movies, and then TV is the like far, far, far last one. Rank this from important to least important. All right, cool. What'd you got, Colin? So I would put readings first because you love Comics. Yeah, 'cause I love Comics.

And the funny thing about it is that reading encompasses all this other stuff while none of the other topics encompass reading at all. So like I can read about music, I can read about games, I can read about TV, I can read about movies. Uh, but if I were to watch a movie about reading, for instance, that would be a little weird or something like that. That would be a lower on the list. So reading like really does encompass everything. So I think I play a game about reading apartment. Uh, number two would be music. And, uh, this is a tough one for me. I mean, like, because music would almost be number one. Um, specifically playing music, which I love to do, but listening to music, music is so important to me. Um, way more important to me than almost anything. So, um, I can't imagine a life without, without music. Like that's just",

I'd give up Greg. Sorry, Greg. Uh, sorry, Greg. I'll sing to you. Um, so yeah, like reading is definitely like the fundamental thing just because it's a huge umbrella and I like to read and I like to learn. But music, yeah, is that thing where it's, that's music is so, I listen to music hours every day. It's a, it's a part of my life. Playing music, you guys don't know that part of me too well, even though I play bass and guitar like, you know, here. Although my, my E string, my bass is all screwed up, so I haven't played in a while. Um, but I played music for hours every day when I was a kid. My drums and stuff like that.

Listening, yeah, the slow joke I got, uh, that go on the list. Oh, just masturation cator. He gave us to five. So the, so yeah, so music, I just can't overstate how, how essential music is to me. It's like such an important art form. Like it's, it's emotional, it's, it's resonant, it's powerful. Um, like life without music is just not a life worth living at all for me. Um, and I mean that 100%. If someone was like, you can't listen to music anymore, I'd be like, well, I don't really want to live. Uh, I'm straight, I'm straight up. It's like, why?

Although I was thinking about put TV ahead of it, but I think games would be, you know, games are so important to me for so long. I've been playing games for almost 30 years. So it's, um, you know, video games are, are transcendent as it were. And so I would put that there. And then TV shows, I'd put number four because I like my TV shows. I like my, my stories as they might say. Uh, and then I put movies being all of our grandparents. Yeah. And then number five, I put movies. And the funny thing about this is I love all these things. It's just, uh, that would be, you know, that's why the choices are hard. That's why the topic came up in my mind about how you would order your media.

Like, like, would you be comfortable with that choice? That the choices you made? And for me, if I had reading and music and nothing and none of these other things, I'd be totally comfortable with that. I mean, I wouldn't want to do that, but if that was the choice I had to make, I wouldn't want to reorder it in any way. Me too, with that games and reading. I got reading, music. I put reading as number one, not because I read a lot, but you love books, because every single time I read, I'm like, ****, I really like this. I should do this more often.

I'm like, this is really dense. There's a lot of different names in this. I don't think I'm going to. And within the first chapter, I'm like, holy ****, this is like, this is like a predecessor to Game of Thrones, but in space, like 300 years from now, SP, like it's such a unbelievably well realized world. And it's done to the point where you hit the last page and you're like, oh, but you're talking like 100, I think it's like 800. I read on an iPad, so I don't know how many pages it actually equates out to be in paperback, but I think it's in like seven or 800 pages. Um, and I'm like, ****, this was a great experience.

I'm looking up IMDb. I'm, my attention's really being drawn away. I get up, I go do something. But with reading, I'm like, sit down, you're in this own world. And if it's a book that's worth the, uh, you know, uh, you know, is actually worth it, then you're just, you lose time. And it's such a, it's such a wonderful thing. Um, next is movies for me, just because I will always love movies. Uh, I, I, you know, I think it's, I think it is my preferred method of just how I like to get the three-act structure of a story told to me. And let's be honest, most of the great movies out there were good books to begin with. So with those two, I feel like I got the whole basis covered. Um, I put",

And no, we're not supposed to put there, there. But I will loop in like podcasts with music because they all kind of come through my phone. I don't know if that's the same thing or not, but just having someone in your ear, like, like just spoken word or music in my ear, I think is really, really important to me. It's how I relax. Um, and I actually put games next above TV. And here's why, because recently I've realized that TV for the most part is a tremendous waste of time. Sure. And it is just the exact same thing over and over. I'm talking Network Television, exact, with the except rare exception of obviously The Walking Dead, The Game of Thrones, The Daredevil, the things that are trying",

I'm talking Network Television, exact, with the except rare exception of obviously The Walking Dead, The Game of Thrones, The Daredevil, the things that are trying to be different. It is still TV is still stuck in this weird need to be episodic, need to run multiple, multiple seasons to the point where every single show just runs itself into the ground. And I'm tired of the rat race. And I just, to me, it's all just monster of the week stuff. That's, yeah, true. And everyone in the comments like, it's crazy, there's all this great stuff on TV. There are good things on TV. It's all derivative, you know? Um, and so I would put games above that because to me, I'm, I'm still kind of relatively like getting into games. And so every time I play a good game, like I played, we played Firewatch. I was like, ah, it was really cool. That was a different experience for me. Completely different way to, uh, to experience a story. That was really, really fun. Of course, then you play games that you",

I, before I used to try to play that, I had the pressure of like, I started this, I got to finish it. At a certain point, I'm like, nope, I'm done, done. Uh, but I will give a shout out to YouTube as well and to porn. Yeah, shout outs take up a lot. Both, both which take up an exorbitant amount of my time for sure. So I did, so I just did the, the math here on what every, what everyone's choices were and the C, because I want to see what we accumulate, how we would accumulatively rate everything. And it makes sense, I think. Uh, number one would be reading, so books. Mhm. But more importantly, I think the Internet for you guys and me too, probably. Um, Comic Books for Greg.

Right behind it is music at number three, and then movies at number four, and then TV at number five. And that's that. I can live with that list. I mean, I would rather, because that list is fine. It's not ordered the way I would order it. There's a few, you know, things that, that would be moved around. But I almost asked how you would order it, but then I realized you already did. Yeah, reading, music, games, movies. Um, yeah. Um, but I don't want, I do want to give a, a special shout out to, uh, porn. To, yeah, to porn. Of course, porn.

Careful with like what you want, like what you would want. Not that that would happen, but like what would you want that list to look like in that reality? I would be totally, I mean, honestly, if, if someone said, and this is the idea I flirt with, I'm, I'm just in the age bracket where like the idea of cutting the cable is just, it's still painful to me, but I could do without TV.

It's a great show, but this **** of like, hey, let's do a mid-season break. Hey, let's space this out. Hey, let's keep **** you. Like, I'm super into this. I don't want to wait six weeks. It ruins my emotional value. Now, you guys said it was, I haven't watched the episode from last week. I'm sure it's great. I'm sure I'll get right back into it. Eat my words. But at the same time, watch something like, um, House of Cards or like Luther or anything or like the, um, the, the great work that Benedict Cumberbatch and, uh, the guy from The Hobbit did with Sherlock, right?",

Which is like BBC does. They go, we're going to do Sherlock. It's three episodes, but every episode's two hours or an hour and a half-ish, right? So you're getting these awesome stories that, that are like mini movies, but they only feel they need to do three. And boom, they put that out. And you may or may not get any more of those, which is great. There's no need to be like, got to get that next season of three episodes out again. And oh God, what's the, what's the plot going to be this week? Okay, well, okay, well, maybe the people from Law and Order meet someone who, uh, killed someone with an axe. No, we've already done that 50 times. ****, maybe they killed with an axe, but the axe was up their ass when they did it and they fell backward onto the person's head and cleaved them by accident. Cool, that's a great story.",

Cool, that's a great story. Let's get into that. Right before you went into that really weird story, I was with you of like, yeah, like even with Walking Dead this week when it was a great episode, but it was the first 10 minutes was like re-acclimating myself to like, where do we leave off? You know what I mean? They showed the previously. I'm walking. I was like, all right, oh, oh, right, Morgan did. Oh, totally. I hadn't thought about that in six weeks. Where are we picking in? What's happening? And what's that character's name again? And yeah, I just feel like for me, you know, Internet video, there's going to be a merging point. There's going to be a converging point eventually. We're already hitting up. We're already for, I mean, your next topic, by the way, it does, which is great.
