I don't like when you do this because it either looks like Superman's gonna- Oh no. He's about to get his head cut off. I know it looks like that or he's Taz from old school ECW, he's coming out to fuck somebody up. It's one of the two for sure. And I don't want either of those to happen to Superman. No no no. Over there, the pure one, Tim Gettys. What's up, let Tim host. We just forced Nick Scarpino to go home early because he's sick, and thank you for addressing Elephant in the Room. I have not talked to you about this, and you've thrown me some curves. Because I'll never forget the first time at IGN you showed up and your hair was all nimbly bimbly, and I was like, what is this? Oh, this is what I do on haircut days. But then recently, you've just been a lazy fuck, and you come in with your hair not done. We'll get to",

It's not really that, it's called something else, that's why I didn't know. Yeah, but I mean, it kind of goes into it, it's how much I like that, that causes this. But you know, this is a thing. It's longer than I've spent a long time. I'm channeling my little Dickie. You know, it's happening. But no, no, I'm going to good old Philadelphia, Colin's homeland of the East Coast, to visit my girlfriend. Sure. Now as the East Coast, you're going to count that as the East Coast? Yeah, Philadelphia is the original capital. I know that. I don't think you do know that. As East as you can go. Because if you did know that, you would know that it is a real East Coast city.

I really doubt you're going to let anybody slide by on something that's not 100%. No, the original 13 Colonies, also known as real America. You know, Pennsylvania is part of that. So of course, Philadelphia, you know. Philadelphia was the, what was it? Fresh Prince of Bel-Air setting. What was the kind of, what was the statistic? For like three seconds of the theme song. Oh no. Not that it doesn't exist. The statistic was that, no, we talked about this on the show a few months ago that I was reading about old like Indian cities from like these extinct North American Indian tribes that had like capital cities of 0, 30, 40,000 people.

That's what I was thinking. Did you see the Native American slash Indian commercial from the Super Bowl? That wasn't like a real commercial but went out on the internet. The Indian crying? No, no, not that one. It was a different one. It was really well done. It was really, really well done. No, I wasn't paying attention to the commercials. It wasn't, I don't think it was on during the Super Bowl. I caught it on the internet last night, but it's a shot at the Redskins. I was like, got to nail the bottom.

Hoping this toxic, I'm sorry, hoping this topic might help some of the best friends parentheses and maybe Colin M. who suffer from chronic anxiety. Understand that it can be managed and it's worth seeking help. Medication isn't the only treatment, so it's important to let a doctor help you figure out what might work for you.

This has been kind of part of the political conversation for a while, the cycle, because of the way felons are treated, the way our prisons work.

There are countries with over a billion people in them that have fewer people in prison, including a totalitarian communist dictatorship that, that in prisons political enemies has fewer people in prison than the United States.

So like that would be a very serious and very very systemic way of looking at things. And the juries are probably get hung a lot because so many people are just fundamentally against the death penalty. So in a death penalty trial you'd then sentence the jury to being hung to death.

My sleep schedule I usually I sometimes sleep like twice a day. So it's like you know last night I slept for like five hours. I'll probably go to bed after this and then I'll get up at like seven and go to the grocery store and and like start doing work. I like working at night as well. I've always been that way.

So I love to sleep. It's like the way I as I said an anxiety topic. It's the way I escape my anxiety as I sleep. Just close my eyes and and get away from things. But I love I love to sleep. It's just sad to think that we spend over a third of our lives sleeping but we have to. It's necessary. And so reading about sleep and the biology of sleep and what what it does and what they think it is cause you guys were kidding around about it but they we really don't quite understand sleep actually.

It is very primal yet very complicated. It is something we've been doing since we learned you know primordial yet like we still don't quite get why it happens. And there's a lot of people that spend their lives trying to study what's going on in here. You know we understand the cycles of REM and all that kind of stuff now but and you're 90 minute you know you sleep in like 90 minute cycles. So they say it's best to get what is it? Three six or nine hours of sleep. But like or in like 90 minute increments as long as you're asleep because like if you wake up in the middle of the cycle you're like even if you slept",

So there's a lot of fascinating stuff scientifically and biologically about sleep that I think is quite riveting that I wish we understood better but it's still something that I totally embrace. And I love you know I love to sleep. I always love to sleep. And it reminds me of when you're young and you're growing up and you're expending a lot of energy and you're growing like literally growing. And you know I used to sleep for like 1 or 14 hours a day on weekends. It was awesome. I'd go to bed at like two in the morning and I'd get up at literally like five.

It's like I'm playing video games or something. It's not meaningful. So I was like what is the playing a video game or anything like that? It's like not meaningful way of spending your time. What's the difference? So at that point I'm like I never feel guilty about sleeping. Well it's one of those things up until right now I've never been I could you know I could play a video game right.
