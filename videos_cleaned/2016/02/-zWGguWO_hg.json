Greg, flex that muscle. Look at up, look at that. God, I love you. You look so good in his heather gray shirt. Thank you. I like the long sleeves, keeps my uh wrists warm over here. The pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. It's good to be here with you today. Good to be here with you today. And over there, the pure one, Tim Gettys. Let Tim host now. Let's get right to the heart of the matter. We're about to talk about Firewatch. This is posting before Firewatch is released to the general public. We're doing a our reacts discussion of it. So I want to do a spoiler-free portion right here in the front that is a simple question: Do you recommend people play this game? And then why, without a spoiler? So Tim, do you recommend people play this game and why or why not? Um, I do. Okay, because despite its faults, it's short enough to give you a lot of good things. Okay, Colin, um",

I I but I think that uh you should go in with tempered expectations because it's I don't think a very good game. I just think it has some good ideas. Do you think it's a bad game? No. Okay, so it's somewhere in between good and bad. Yeah, I think it's it I I think people should play it because of its unique setting. It's unique, sure. Uh, you know, it's got a lot of unique qualities. Okay, my non-spoilery answer to the question is that I had high expectations for Firewatch. It did not meet them. Parts of it did. I recommend you play it 'cause I think the most enjoyable part of Firewatch so far is all the conversations I've had with people afterwards. All the ones we've had individually talking about it.

I mean, where you leave and you've take you've put yourself into it, so you take something different from it. So you talk to other people and you cobble together what the overall I can see that 'cause even even playing it, I was like, I'm not necessarily loving my time right now. There was definitely moments and as it went on, it got better. But um, it was afterwards when I thought about it. I was like, huh, I liked that more than I than you thought you did. Did? Sure, sure, sure. That was definitely my morning after when I I had beaten it and then the next morning went and hung out with Mitch and Alex and we talked about it for a long time.

Anything that's considered an art is supposed to evoke some sort of emotion in about, oh, I don't know, 5 minutes and I was like, wow, I'm I'm really invested in this. I want to see where this goes. Um, and I don't think there was a moment where I was bored per se. Um, the game is certainly not without its flaws and we'll get into that in a second. But um, I enjoyed it. Great. So there you go.

But that was your chance, so you can stop watching right now. Mhm. Or you can mute it, just let us talk, help our watch time on YouTube. But now it's gonna be spoilery. So for me, I I think not I I went out of my way not to know anything about Firewatch. You know what I mean? They were on our GDC stream. We've seen the trailers and stuff and I stopped there. I don't read the previews. IGN had the whole like month of first on it. Didn't go and watch any of that stuff on it, right?

And I start this game. I'm playing through that prologue. I'm making choices. It's telling me all the stuff about my wife. I'm living the I was like, holy **** **** up through like day two. I was like, I can't believe I even I knew I had high expectations. I'm like, this game is delivering on them. Through like day two, I was like, I can't believe how much I'm enjoying this. I don't know what's going to happen. It gave me those uh Gone Home vibes of being a game and not even sure what the game was.

And I thought I'm gonna scare them, but I'm accident going to kill one of them and then I'm it's going to be this whole thing of like covering up what's happening. I just had no real idea what the game was going to be. And so like I loved that thing. But then as we got on to it, I felt like it had it went into like Man of Steel territory where I expected the game to be up here and or the product to be up here, right? And it ended up being lower than that. But initially I thought it was even lower than that. You know what I mean? Where I played it and I'm like, I get to the end.

I wanted them to sort of get together and and live happily ever after in the end, you know, two flawed people. And she was a bit codependent, you know, she had she had her hang-ups and you have your hang-ups and you discover this throughout the dialogue trees if you want to, which I didn't even realize. Like I didn't realize you could be an **** to her and like not have any relationship with her at all.

You can be so then she's totally responding to you as if you are an **** who doesn't even respond. There's a lot of times I accidentally didn't respond to her. Yeah, it goes fast. And then yeah, 'cause and I thought this was really interesting. The bar I've noticed sometimes it doesn't even need to hit the end before she just automatically responds like, oh, fine, I guess you're not talking to me, which I thought was a cool little thing where it's like, it keeps you on your toes of like, I thought I had a little bit longer.

Yeah, you were talking about you have this emotional connection to Delilah and you get to the end, you don't even to see her. And that you thought that was like, wow, what the hell or whatever. For me, it was like always read into our relationship was one of convenience. You know what I mean? Don't get me wrong. I was hoping we could hook up or whatever. Like I'm, you know, out there trying to forget my wife and Alzheimer's and dementia and all this other stuff, right? But like for me, there's that moment where you know, you I forget it's like Day 70, whatever it is, right? Where you come to at the desk or whatever, you take control at the desk or whatever and you stand up and your wedding ring's there. And I made a point to pick it up and put it back on like",

Like I'm not in love with Delilah, but I wanted to see how that relation sus that relationship out. You know what I mean? Yeah, I mean, it was it's it's hard because inevitably the the the game or the story of the game is a tragedy, right? Like no matter what that the main character is is going to have to suffer through or not suffer through the rest of his life, but he's going to have to deal with that for the rest of his life, right? His wife is gone, but she's still living. So that is a conflict that is really from a writing perspective kind of an interesting thing to play with because your character we're we're we're told sort of in Classic Hollywood that like the guy always gets the girl at the end, right?

That always be the villain to get the girl at the end and everything's happily ever after. But this is a story that even if they had any outcome of it is still going to be a little bit tragic and a little bit depressing because whether he had chosen to ostracize his wife and let her live the rest of her life in Australia and go with Delilah or go to her, it doesn't really matter, right? He's going to be trapped in this sort of his own sort of prison for the rest of his life dealing with this issue. I like that a lot. I liked that the from the first moments of the game like all the the dialogue trees like going through them from them meeting up to them being married and all that stuff.

Like even I was asking you 'cause like you guys have all talked about, you're like, yeah, it doesn't do anything. And that's what I thought. Like even after those first things, I was like, no matter what I choose, you're just getting a different variation on the same story. And I like I liked that. I liked that it there it's not, you know, the choices you're making change if you see her at the end or not or whatever. It is just kind of like, it's the story's going and what you're saying is just, you know, you can either be a little funnier or a little more scared of the situation or this or that.

And I way I was talk about it, right? Is that I always talk about Walking Dead and all these games where you make these choices, right? As we're all given the same story. We're all given the same same blank coloring book page, but it's up to us how we shade it in that makes it our own, right? For me, like early on, like, you know, I think if you if I was going to talk to you about what I think the canonical Henry is, right? I think he's he looks like Wreck-It Ralph and he's blue-collar and he's maybe got an alcohol problem, da da, right? But I didn't shade mine that way, right? Like I meet her at the",

So like when we get there, I'm very much picturing Henry is this bulky guy. But like there's that, you know, I I don't know how it was for you when the mugger steps up to you in the prologue, right? And this is all in text, by the way, if you're if you're spoiling the game for yourself. When the mugger steps up, right? I beat the **** out of him and then I sit there on the curb and cry myself before c cry myself to whatever like devastation before the cops even get there, right? And for me, that was very telling of this man similar to me, right? Who's big but and but expresses anger like that. But then, you know, I get cry when I get angry, right? When I'm mad, I cry.

When I'm mad, I cry. And so like that's where I put that. So by the time I get to being in Firewatch on the job or whatever, I'm picturing very much Henry being a Wreck-It Ralph kind of guy, but with the temperament of Harry Crane from Mad Men because that's the voice, right? So he is this bigger dude, but he's not outrageous. He's not this, he's not that. And that's stem from my choices of how I interpreted based on that part. But then you're talking to people of like, you know, I I made the choice of when she's sick, I put her in a home, right? I'm not equipped to deal with this. That's I feel the adult choice. Whereas there is the other choice of no, no, I'll take care of her, which ends with you get a DUI, which ends that fits the I'm blue-collar **** up Henry and the guy who going rumble in the streets kind of thing.

Um, because you do have choices and your interaction with this person does change based on those. Um, but that was a slight disappointment of mine going into sort of the third act of the story. I I feel like overall, like I liked the game. I liked the first two-thirds of the game. But in I think it suffered a little bit from the same thing that most kind of thriller-esque psychological thriller movies suffer from, which is like inevitably the payoff is not going to be it's not going to be as fun as the setup.

Um, it's giving me a good story. There's a the acting I thought was great. I thought the voice acting was phenomenal. Um, I actually ruined it when I realized who the guy was. I was like, ****, it's the guy from Mad Men because I can't stand that because I was so immersed in the character that I'm like, this guy's doing a great job.

Why did you tell me that? 'Cause at first I was like, I kind of imagined like, um, for some reason, I was like, is that Craig T. Nelson? But it was not Craig. Awesome. Amazing coach. Uh, but yeah, I mean, I liked all that. But that was it was it was slightly disappointing that kind of going in toward to the third act, like nothing I did really mattered. Um, on a high level, you know, on the minutia, what you're talking about, yes, it did.

And wait, it's just it's this the small. It reminded me of a movie that I loved all the way up until the very, very last part of it, which was Strange Days. I don't know if you guys ever saw that movie, Strange Days. It's it's an old movie with Ralph Fiennes and Tom Sizemore.
