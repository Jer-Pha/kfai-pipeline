I am up for Most Entertaining Online Personality at the South by Southwest Gaming Awards, and it would mean the world to me if you went and voted for me. Of course, every time we win one of these things, we win for Kinda Funny, and it's a win for you because we get to go there and be like, \"Hey, people who've never heard of us, guess what? People like us.\" And they go, \"Who are you?\" And they go, \"Maybe I want to be a best friend.\" Or they're jerks and they say, \"We'll stay away forever.\" So if you go to KindaFunny.com/SXSW and vote Greg Miller for Most Entertaining Online Personality, I would take it as a personal favor that I will never, ever be able to repay you for. What's up, everybody? Welcome to The GameOverGreggy Show. I am one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the producer/seducer Nick Scarpino. Colin, if you grab that thing any harder, you're not getting into heaven. Did you ever find your high-gloss cleaner? No, I didn't. Well, you told me when I asked",

Yeah, and I say, \"Do you know where it is?\" And you said, \"No, feel free to go root through his room.\" Did you just come out? He's there. The top thing's like, Colin's one of those guys that if you betray his trust just once, yeah, you're never getting back into that. Sure, I'm never getting back into the tree of trust. And then I cherish the tree. I trust you do. I like being in that circle tree that's in us. There's a circle with a tree in it. Yeah, I'm in the tree of trust right now. You guys are all out of it.

Well, yeah, that's why Colin doesn't work with it. Okay, that when a when we were doing the when that when the presentation was going on over and from Japan, it was taped. Obviously, I was waiting for them to get to the end to announce the March 30th event or whatever. And it happened. And then Square put up the graphic, put out the press release that announced us. And I had GAF open, and I had Reddit open, and I went through. And as soon as the first person pops, it was like, \"Tim makes sense, but why is Greg there?\" I was like, \"Hey, that's exactly what I said to Square when they reached out to us.\" And they said, \"No, we understand that.

I had Final Fantasy's Twitter and Square's Twitter, and then they retweeted. We had like my tweet, and I felt so, yeah, you even know the moment. Oh, yeah, I screenshot that. It's funny, 'cause like, you know, I posted a lot of stuff. I've done a lot of things Square before.

I'm like, \"Oh, yeah, that's gonna happen, whatever.\" And then it was like the reaction of everyone, like, \"Alright, it's a bigger deal.\" And I was given credit for. Yeah, just like a panel or something. This is a live conference thing in the Shrine Auditorium where they normally do like big E3 press conferences and stuff. EA does theirs there, right?

But then I realized, I think the space part, I think it's actually the NASA made Velcro. I could be wrong about that. And but then I when I learned that it was just hooks with like a bunch of wires that way that every time you rip the Velcro off, it destroys the hooks. And so it's just the, I'm like, that's not as smart as I thought it was. I'm, you know, far less impressed now. Like it because you don't even use a finite amount of time.

But eventually what happened was you had to go farther and further to get the catch because it would use you need to use the part that hasn't been used as much. And so eventually my hands were turning purple because I was like trying to get the last little bit of Velcro. And my wife just didn't think that all good wife should do. Or she just kind of was like, \"Honey, let it go, Indiana. Let it go.\" Your wife Sean Connery is Sean Connery. My life is Sean Connery. I don't think about Jesus since the kiss. I wish you wouldn't.

I didn't go to Catholic school early enough to have this being played. What is what's going along with this now? I just explained what it is because I can't take it. There was once a wee little man named Zacchaeus. Hmm. And the Lord Jesus Christ came to town, and he's walking through, and everybody, you know, was crowding the streets to see Jesus. But Zacchaeus was a wee little man. A wee little man was he. So he couldn't see the Lord Jesus Christ. So he climbed way up in a sycamore tree for the Lord to see. I've been there. Been song. But why is that a story? Who gives a ****? Because what's the **** is parable here? I believe without having to watch, I'd like to brush up on the video, but I'll I mean, I'm remembering the important thing. But Zacchaeus was small. All right. This has all right.

So that must be so that must be they didn't like invent him. This I'm asking. I'm asking what the context is in it since in the **** Gospels. That's all I was trying to wonder. So it's Zacchaeus was trying to see who Jesus was. It was unable because of the crowd, for he was small in stature. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree in order to see him, for he was about to pass through that way. When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, \"Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.\" Run a **** here. Be all right. So then, so he ran on ahead and climbed up and went. Okay, so he ran on ahead and climbed up into the sycamore tree in order to see him for you.

When he saw it, they all began to grumble, saying, \"He has gone to be the guest of a man who was a sinner.\" Yeah, now we're getting the tax collector. Nobody likes the tax collector back in those times. It's much different than now. Nobody liked the tax collector back then. So when Zacchaeus came around, rap down your door, people like, \"Ah, little shits here for my gold and bread or whatever we use as currency.\" Luke 19:8 says, \"These bread is Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, 'Behold, Lord, half of my possessions I will give to the poor, and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give back four times as much.'\" Zacchaeus know, and Jesus said to him, \"Today salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of a\"",

We got some weird tangents on the show, but I don't even understand the source of this. There was the tree of trust. Is that where this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was from the tree of trust. And then we said that Kevin isn't in the tree, and I said, \"Yeah, he's so far out of the side of the gates, he can't see it,\" which made me think of a little Zacchaeus. Like Zacchaeus. I don't remember ever hearing about Zacchaeus. Why is it why is the Gospel of Luke written like a **** railroad modern novel? Because get to the point.

Yeah, and that caused the Fine Bros to totally can the program and rescind all of their applications for the copyrights, all their applications to copyright the word Reacts in the terms of whatever it is.

Myself included. Well, the biggest the bigger issue is the fact that their format is titled something that is so general that is like the factor. Kids React is what they were returning to the copyright for. And sorry to go back for a second. So they did get the copyright for Reacts. The the word, the term Reacts in relation to videos where you're showing people things and you're interviewing them about what they think about the thing. That's the trademark interests getting. Now again, trademarks one of those things. I read this really fascinating article by Hank Green kind of talking about all this about how no one knows how trademarks and copyrights work. Nobody like even the people that understand it don't understand it because it doesn't mean anything until legal matters are brought into it. And at that point, then it's",

And at that point, then it's challenged. And then it's this whole thing where it's a case by case basis. So there isn't really rules to it all. But the idea with with what they're doing is if they copyright it, there's something like a 30-day period where if they had waited 30 days after they had filed that thing, they would have had it and it would have been theirs. But because they put it out there to the public and there was such a negative reaction, the public has 30 days to come in and challenge it so that they can't get the the copyright on it. So had they been had they waited just a little bit longer to put React World out there, they would have had the copyright to React videos.
