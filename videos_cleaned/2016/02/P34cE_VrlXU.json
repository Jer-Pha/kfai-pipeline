Bart says hey Nick and Tim and Trisha he didn't he didn't know you that's okay I started my senior year of high school a few weeks ago and in one of my classes I sit opposite this really pretty girl we talk a bunch and she gives me some come-hither vibes but how do I know if she likes me she laughs at my amazing pun jokes and is interested in my boring lectures so is that a good sign what can I do to show her that I'm interested in her we make eye contact and smile a bit however I'm not sure how effective that is I mean I've always used the age-old uh practice of just saying hey I like you we should hang out it it generally gets you the answer",
