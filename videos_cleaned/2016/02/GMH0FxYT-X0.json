We're talking about the fact that all of our dreams are coming true in the DC TV Universe. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here with not so breaking news, but a whole bunch of insight for you on the fact that Grant Gustin, yes, the Flash from CW, is coming to Melissa Benoist's Supergirl show on CBS. Not enough people are talking about this. I did it on Colin. First off, Colin didn't put it on Colin Live, our new show each and every day, twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames. Uh, and it's this is huge. This is huge. It is. I even know this. I don't watch the DC TV Universe stuff, but I know that up until now, the Supergirl has kind of been it, like Gotham, just kind of its own side thing. But this was more of a will it, won't it type situation. Yeah, exactly. Cause what we got to go back to is if you're not paying attention to the DC TV Universe, what you need to know is that there is one true Lord and Savior and",

Now, if you don't know Greg Berlanti, it's very simple. He's the guy behind all of these shows. Now, I'll address the elephant in the room, Tim Greg is not following me on Twitter. I don't understand Greg Berlanti. I am Greg, you are Greg. We are both clearly obsessed with the DC Universe. You are behind Arrow, Flash, Supergirl. Here's where it gets really upsetting, Blindspot. Why is this upsetting? One of my best friends, Ashley Johnson, is in the Blindspot. I don't know what else I have to do, Greg, to follow me on Twitter, but I'm getting off track here. So when Greg was behind the whole thing on Flash, Arrow, all the stuff making this universe. Now, of course, now they got, you know, DC's Legends of Tomorrow happen over there.

And he's never beaten on the bush very clearly. I mean, at the last critics association meeting or whatever the hell they call him, you know, they go up wherever Matt Fowler and Eric Goldman go disappear too forever. He was talking like, if it's going to happen, it's going to happen soon. We're trying to make it happen. Da. And then today it comes that it's happening none other than March 8th. Oh my. Right around, right around the corner. And then today, as now it's announced today, Grant Gustin on Instagram. Yeah, I follow Grant Gustin on Instagram. Y'all should too.

If you've ever seen one of these videos where I talk about DC things, I get very, very excited. So this is just one of the things. So now you might ask, why am I grabbing at the notepad? Yeah, why you grabbing the notepad? You know that I know all these facts, cause there's some people that need to get taken to task. Number one, Entertainment Weekly (EW.com). You do fantastic work, and I like a lot of your things, don't get me wrong. But over on EW, it was written, this is happening, Flash/Supergirl crossover, March 8th. Everybody's super excited.

Having the Flash first cross over, crossover with Supergirl seems a little more plausible considering they're both metahuman in in and superheroes heavy shows. But since Barry Allen lives in a neighboring town to Oliver Queen, that means that Kara Danvers hails from the same universe. Therefore, the possibility of a future crossover with Arrow isn't improbable. It's just not happening right now. Hold the phone, EW. I cursed again. Here's my problem with this, is that you are jumping to conclusions. You have busted out the Office Space Jump to Conclusions Mat. I'm not a fan of that. The problem here is that they are very much not in the same universe. Fact, in the CW Universe, Superman does not exist. We have never talked about Superman. We have never referenced Superman.

There's a thing in the background that says Metropolis. No offense. Oh, you're making me think of, I think the that made me spring to mind a shipping crate, but I do believe that was in the Batman games. I'm thinking doesn't matter. Maybe I've missed it, but for sure they've never talked about Superman, because of course Superman is universe breaking. You can't be Oliver Queen in Star City and be like, I'm Green Arrow, I'm doing amazing things, whatever, cats from trees. Exactly. Cause what was great, what was really cool and still is cool about the CW Universe, right, is that they didn't have metahumans until Flash.

Well, there was that in the Mirakuru, of course, Deathstroke. You remember the Mirakuru? Ugh. But I mean, for the most part, that's how they kept it going. So there was no aliens coming to Earth, this that and the other. You know what I mean? There also no Batman. We don't hear about Gotham City. You know what I mean? Because of course, if we're being honest here, Arrow, Arrow very much Batman. We're not not lying here. Um, so the fact is that they are not in the same universe whatsoever. Also, because over in Supergirl's Universe, there's no talk Flash, talk Green Arrow. There is talk, of course, Superman, who shows up as a shadowy figure in im's car a lot.

They don't get into the weeds like Flash. There's not people putting up the like the pins and the strings trying to figure everything out with that show. Yeah, okay, that's one way we say, I don't know. Okay, sure. Um, so clearly what's happening here, EW, is that they are not in the same universe. They are very clearly in the Multiverse. You are a DC fan out there. If you're watching and you you've struggled along this far, you know as well as I do, the Multiverse, Infinite Earths, all these different things happening. Of course, right now this season of Flash, they are dealing with the Multiverse. Season two, they have all these different portals open to different universes or whatever Earth-Two.",

That's why we got Jay Garrick over and you know, Barry Allen's world and all these different things are happening. It's conceivable, perhaps too easy to assume that one of the these universal portals leads over to Supergirl's Universe, where we're going to go over to National City, see CatCo Media, see what's happening. Do I think that's the case? Yeah, I do. I think that's because I I think that's the easiest solution to it. And not only is it the easiest, it's the solution that makes the most sense. Now here, Tim, is where it gets very, very exciting. Because if they introduce this fact, this now means that let's let's let's lay it down from this thing. Okay, March 8th comes and goes. March 8th, we wake up. We open Variety, as I believe it still probably comes in a paper, even though we look at doom and we go, oh my",

This is super cool, which then all of a sudden opens up the thing of like, well, we got to keep doing this. Do we do we want to do it with Gotham? Well, do we want to do it with the movies? Now you might say the movies, of course not, that stupid, Greg. Why would you do it? The movies doesn't make any sense. I'd say this, of course, because it does make sense. And this is the whole thing is I had a whole video. I want I everybody knows out there that I want to do a video about my Superman video game, right?

Christopher Meloni's like, you know, I come from this world. I need to talk to Lois Lane. I need to talk K. They do some research. Lois Lane got killed in this thing. Never existed really in their universe, right? Same thing with uh Clark Kent. That nobody's ever heard of of right. The Kent never had a kid. Da da da. Now here's where it gets awesome.

Barry runs back to Central City, goes through. Cuts in Dr. Wells (a.k.a. Reverse-Flash) at this point, cause we're season one, remember. Walks in the part of accelerator, opens the thing. Tom Cavanagh's there just killing it like Tom Cavanagh does. And Barry's like, I'm talking this guy over here. He's saying, uh, Lois Lane, Clark Kent, Superman. Do you know anything about this? This is where this would have been the finale of Season 1 Flash. Tom Cavanagh also strapped to a chair and goes, of course I do, Mr. Allen. Do you think only I went back in time to kill to kill to kill a hero? And it's that thing that like they the Rogues in the future had come back through, you know, and killed all sorts of people. So",

I don't know what they do, but they do something with baby Superman. It's probably too much on on a CW show. Kab. They kick them back. They pick it up and they just throw they just throw the spaceship back. I hit particular hard, but you understand where I'm going with this. That would have been the thing.

And we did a piece where we talked about, I don't know how much I'm supposed to say because they cut it out and I was kind of bummed they cut it out.

It's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to the best world. Everyone has a vision, and you really want to let the vision shine through. I think the characters are iconic enough. I like Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. a lot. I love what Marvel does. I'm a huge fan. It's just a different approach.

Gal Gadot, Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck, they're all movie stars now. They're we're gonna do this whole thing. We're gonna stay out there. Christopher Meloni, man of the people.

But like, we don't needan in this universe. Erica Durance is perfect. Uh, Aquaman in Lazer Team, a Rooster Teeth movie. And I could text Burnie right now.
