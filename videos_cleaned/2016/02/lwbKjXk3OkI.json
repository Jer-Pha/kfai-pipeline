Now, I didn't have a topic today going in, so I was thinking, I was like, what, what do I want to talk about? I was like, I don't know. I was looking on Facebook, scrolling through some stuff, and all of a sudden it hit me of how much I want to be sleeping right now. I'm like, that should be my topic. And you said this applied to your hair somehow. Yeah, I really like sleep. I like sleep. You know, you guys know me, you all know me. There's a couple things Tim Gettys like. I like soda. Yeah, you like Coke. I like eating out in all senses of the word. A Jesus God. Um, I like that's pretty much it, and I like sleep. All right, so, so here's my about Nintendo, you're N. I like Pok\u00e9mon. I like, I like a lot of stuff, right? But I really like sleep, and I think sleep kind of overcomes everything really. Like, I enjoy food. Hunger is definitely, you know, an emotion to me, okay, of just, you know, I need to to feed. It's its hunger. Yeah, um, but when",

You know, there's people that are like, you know, if you sleep too much, you're like, you're just too, it get makes you more tired. No, I mean, maybe, yeah, I guess that's true, but I that's, that's just exciting because I get to sleep sooner, right? You know, and I, I could always sleep instead of doing whatever I'm doing at that moment. Okay, there's a lot of things I like to do, but it's like my perfect vacation, I've said this before, is to just sleep forever. You wake up, you eat with Kevin, you eat out Kevin, and then you, and then go back to sleep. Now, what's weird to me is the fact that I have trouble sleeping. Like, I don't sleep well. Oh, really? Yeah, I wake up a lot, and it takes a lot for me to fall asleep. I'm sleeping with other people, like they'll be conked, and",

It's 'cause I'm always in my head. I'm always thinking about stuff, scheming shit, and doing all that. But I just, you know, the older I get, the more I realize how much I just appreciate sleep and how much it just makes everything better. And the hair thing is because, you know, getting my hair done is a, is a process, man. Like, it's worth it most of the time, but then it's that 15 minutes or like 20 minutes of shower and hair and all that. I'm like, I could be sleeping, man.

Yeah, those some say we, we never sleep, we just go to another dimension of blackness. I haven't heard that. I'm just letting you know that's something Kevin and I have been kicking around in our off time. You guys aren't here, we're doing experiments. I like his socks a lot.

You wake up and go get a bunch of shit done. What was, oh, Saturday, right? Was it, uh, Saturday? No, Sunday. Sunday, we, uh, Saturday we went and did to shoot. Mhm. I don't think any of those videos are going to be up yet by the time this post. Sunday though, I woke up, and then it was Super Bowl Sunday, and I had a bunch of stuff to do, so I woke up later, but it still had a good morning, morning routine of that.

I had a cup of coffee while I went, walked around the grocery store, and then we went to Brunch. It was like the best Saturday, 'cause I woke up and I was energized, and I went and knocked out all this shit that was chore-y but like fun chore stuff, you know what I mean?

Yeah, my sleep schedule, I usually, I sometimes sleep like twice a day. So it's like, you know, last night I slept for like 5 hours. I'll probably go to bed after this, and then I'll get up at like 7:00 and go to the grocery store and, and like start doing work. I like working, working at night as well.

I liked, I liked doing that. It made me feel like I can get more things done because there's fewer distractions. But, um, I rarely get like eight or nine hours of sleep at a time. I like, I have a problem where I have to pee at least once a night too, and, and that breaks, that breaks things up. And I don't even drink that much water at night. Like, it's just, just got to go, you know? Um, so I love to sleep. It's like the way I, I said an anxiety topic, it's the way I escape my anxiety as I sleep. Um, just close my eyes and, and, and get away from things. But I love, I love to sleep. It's just sad to think that we spend over a third of our lives sleeping, but we have to. It's, it's necessary.

You're not like, it's a mental thing. It's a way of making sense of data and like rejuvenation. Yeah, it's, it's, it's weird. It is very primal yet very complicated. It is, um, something we've been doing since we learn, you know, primordial, yet like we still don't quite get why it happens.

But like, or in like 90-minute increments as long as you're asleep. Because like, if you wake up in the middle of the cycle, even if you slept for like 9 hours, if you sleep in, if you get up in like the middle of your last cycle, you're shit more tired than if you got up after 6 hours.
