I am up for Most Entertaining Online Personality at the South by Southwest Gaming Awards, and it would mean the world to me if you went and voted for me. Of course, every time we win one of these things, it's a win for Kinda Funny, and it's a win for you because we get to go there and be like, \"Hey, people have never heard of us. Guess what? People like us.\" And everybody goes, \"Who are you?\" And they go, \"Maybe I want to be a best friend.\" Or they're jerks and they say, \"We'll stay away for everybody.\" So if you go to KindaFunny.com/SXSW and vote Greg Miller for Most Entertaining Online Personality, I would take it as a personal favor that I will never, ever be able to repay you for. Topic three: Final Fantasy XV. Now, I've been saying for years, I can't wait for this game. I'm super stoked.

Me and Greg are hosting their live stream that's going to announce the release date to Final Fantasy XV. I'm very damn excited about this. This is like unreal to me. It's like a freaking dream.

But like when I, it was very every, when this is getting announced, when it was going to finally be announced on Sunday, the last or whatever Saturday at 9:00, 9:00 p.m., uh, I had Reddit and NeoGAF open and I was ready because I knew as soon as we got announced, the first comments would be, I thought they'd be a lot meaner. Everybody was super nice and there was a lot of people of, \"I love Kinda Funny. Tim makes sense. Why is Greg there?\" And the first comment I saw on Reddit that did that, I tackled it. It was like, \"Hey, that's exactly what I asked Square Enix when they came to us and asked us to host.\" And they had a good response, which was, \"I want because I, you remember, I orig tried to, I was like, that's great for Tim, but that\"",

I totally respect, I understand its importance in video games. I've been around long enough to do all that, you know what I mean? I respect it as a franchise, but it's never clicked for me. And so I told them that and I'm like, \"I don't know if I'm the right guy for this.\" And they're like, \"No, you, you're the exact right guy. Like what we think we have with Final Fantasy XV is a game that will appeal to the Tims of the world, the people who love Final Fantasy, but also the people like you that are interested.\" Like, I've been interested when you guys talk about the demos or whatever, right?

But it's like, um, so recently at, uh, last week, to announce this, to announce the announcement event that will announce this. Oh, Square, classic Square. Um, they had during their Active Time Report, which is one of their, I think, monthly things that they've been doing in in in Japan, um, for the January version, they released, it was a long like gameplay demo where they showed a bunch of stuff, talked about a bunch of things, and they showed the Niflheim base battle footage.

And, uh, we've seen a lot of advancements. The interface is totally different and it's it's more way more action oriented. And thank you. And the game looks like Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Yes. And I'm like watching it. I'm like, \"All right, great. This this is Greg's Final Fantasy and this is not Colin's Final Fantasy.\" But to me, I'm like, it didn't feel like it when I played it, but like, I'm down with this.

And because that one little thing just didn't click right with me. Same thing here where it's like, this looks like it should play like Kingdom Hearts. It sounds like Kingdom Hearts. Has the same composer. She's shit amazing, Yoko Shimomura. And um, it just isn't though. It's not quite fast enough. And they they look like they they've sped it up. They've locked it down where the all the stuff that I've been excited for for Final Fantasy XV, even since it was Versus XIII, um, is finally starting to make its way back into it.

So you can kind of mid-battle switch using the D-pad which sword you're using. One's more of like a Dragoon type thing, so you can like jump up and do like the, you know, the screw dive type thing. Um, there's more like a Buster Sword where it's just like your normal sword and then want a bigger one. Like there's a whole bunch of different variants you can do. And, uh, it got me excited.

I'm like, \"All right, whatever.\" And road trips and like, I remember, and that was, you know, I had breakfast with Alexa today. Alexa from Games. She's so so ready for. It's such a huge Final Fantasy. I'm a bad fan. I remember when she was tweeting about that trailer. She's like, \"I'm in tears.\" And I was watching like, \"Cool, a pretty trailer.\" And my thing, I want, I want this clear. Like, I am a huge fan of Final Fantasy. I'm not saying I'm the biggest fan. I'm not the most hardcore by any stretch of imagination. I haven't played all of them. I haven't beat all of them. Um, but I've enjoyed the ones that I have, you know, put time into very much.

I hope that it's good if it's good.\" Um, because I I don't necessarily need what Colin's looking for, like more turn-based and more, you know, classic fantasy stuff. I like that this looks more kind of, um, cyberpunky, like, um, Metal Gear Solid-y, right? So this whole gameplay was a stealth mission, which is there's the the Metal Gear stuff, but it wasn't just a stealth mission. It was a mission to blow up the base. So I'm like, \"All right, so it's Metal Gear Solid V, exactly.\" And you got to put the explosive on the tanker and then you have to go up and turn off the power as well. Well, you go in and there's these Magitek like Warrior things which just exactly look like, uh, Metal Gear Solid V, like like or Metal Gear Solid 4, like Gekkos and shit. Sure, Magitek",

Sure, Magitek Walkers are from Final Fantasy VI, though. VI? No, exactly. Yeah, yeah. But I'm saying like, they now like those little sprites are now these like giant like next-gen things. And seeing that's cool, though. There's so many little little shout-outs like that that I'm like, \"This is for Final Fantasy people.\" You know, there is all those like little things. But to see the character kind of like sneaking around, avoiding the light and then warp killing, which is the shit coolest thing. You just target these shits and warp to them, one hit kill, warp to the other guy. And the the demo was really well-paced in showing off how it all works and how it starts off. It he warp kills and does one person and then he walks a little bit more and then warp, warp, warp and just immediately like kills three. And it's like, \"Oh, shit.\"",

And when it's filled, when you're in a huge battle, you can kind of do these team attacks with your party members. And it's like, it's classic stuff. And it looks again, really like Kingdom Hearts in a good way, but less floaty and less, um, Keyblade, less less Keyblade, but more cool, more badass and more like the fight scenes in Advent Children, which that's awesome to me. I think that's really cool. And it doesn't look like it gets old. And that's something that I I worried about in the in the demo. It did it very quickly. Was like, \"All right, I'm just doing the same animations over and over and over and over.\" This looked like it was a little bit more fluid and",

And that seems cool. But the biggest addition was this is the first time we've seen magic. And, uh, it's now set so that when when you can use your magic, it goes to the D-pad. And it's it, um, affects the environment. So if there is, you can set things on fire. And if there's wood around, the wood will catch on fire. So there was this like wooden staircase that had guards on it. And you can use fire on it and it would like light all the guards up. And so you're trying to take out like a 100 enemies in this base 'cause once you get, um, notified, you're screwed. Sure, you're doing all this things. And then there's they said that there's other elements where like if you use Blizzard on, um, areas of water, it'll freeze it over. And you",

Just calm down. He was bringing you coffee and you flailed your hand into it. And that's exactly what happened earlier today. The kitchen, you know, small small house. Yeah, and he like turned as I was turning and we both I hit his arm, spilled. I was crouching down, not moving. Kevin comes in like a goddamn wrecking ball and pounces into me and the shit coffee goes over when I just made it quieter.

But like having to kind of figure some stuff out, I I think that could be really cool. And, um, my favorite thing about the environment stuff was there there was a big boss fight at the end of it where it's like you you fight one of the Magitek things and it's you're fighting it. You you can pinpoint certain aspects of the of it and like kind of, you know, take them out. And at one point you slice open the thing and gas spills all over the place and then you use fire on the gas and it shit lights the whole thing up. I'm like, \"Hell yeah, that's shit dope.\" Okay, that's cool selling. There's a lot of moments like that that I'm like, \"Oh, this is shit cool.\" And and going back to the the the party thing, there was scenes where when the bar fills",

I'm like, \"All right, yeah, I can connect with a bunch of guys on a road trip, not a bunch of idiot on a train.\" It's weird and it's very not Final Fantasy.

I just don't understand how it's a Final Fantasy game. And I I I felt that way about obviously XIII and XIV and XI. I I I just don't understand X. I I just don't understand like why why at some point the series has to mean something, has to be some sort of convention. Otherwise, why or how is it a Final Fantasy game? It's the same thing we were learning with Dragon Quest X.

There's nothing wrong with X. There's nothing wrong with XI. If you like those games, it's just like, this is starting to lose its it's its connection to like what Final Fantasy is. Is X-ish at best. And it seems like XV is like just a Final Fantasy game in name. Is that is that what we're going to do from now on? We're just going to reinvent everything about the game every time we release it now? And there's just nothing about it that has a connection to it.

It's like, well, when you make 3D Mega Man, it's not Mega Man, you know, 10. It's Mega Man Legends, you know? Or like, uh, you know, when you make a a a futuristic kind of more equipment based, nonlinear, well, Mega Man's nonlinear, but like finding equipment and going back and backtracking, it's Mega Man X, you know?

It's Dragon Quest Online. Why'd you call Dragon Quest X? Yeah, you know?

And then the like the all games have classes, but like classes you can change. And Final Fantasy IV was a more, um, linear narrative and you had class classes, but you couldn't change them. And characters came and go. Like you didn't really have a ch like a chance to customize in VI. You didn't really get to c like Locke was always a thief and and Terra was a mage.

Like with the exception of, um, you know, Cosmic Star Heroine looks awesome, um, which is basically like going to be a new fantasy RPG. And Rainbow Moon and Rainbow Skies. Like these kinds of games like speak to me a little bit more because I just I I I don't necessarily I like characters and storytelling in these games, of course.

It doesn't mean that there's nothing there's nothing wrong with being an action RPG. We love Kingdoms of Amalur. We love these kinds of more action RPGs. But, um, I that's I'll be interested. I'm interested to see like what it is. Yeah, and a couple months ago, uh, the director Tabata said that The Last of Us was an inspiration for him. And like for the direction of the game in terms of how they want to marry the story and the gameplay and kind of have it progress in a very non-forced way where it's not, you know, every five seconds a cut scene or whatever. And it's more just during the gameplay you get the story and get the character development. And even the little, um, bits of gameplay they showed like you saw that with just how",
