Today, Nick, we play really the first major AAA uh release of the year that we're interested in anyway, Far Cry Primal. Love it from Ubisoft. Um, Far Cry Primal of course is a different take on uh the Far Cry formula. Mhm. Uh, it is uh Primal. Yeah, no guns. I'm I'm guessing that's why we're starting with a stone wrapped around a stick. I'm excited about this. Me too. This is an interesting take for them though. Uh, while a lot of people, you know, like you see franchises going into the future or maybe going back as far as like the 70s or 60s or things like that for a shooter, this is kind of this is kind of intense. You're already be handed to you by a bunch of what are these little things? See that's a big mushroom. Eat mushroom. So, all right, so it's already feels very much like a a um a Far Cry game. We're gathering things, we're skinning animals. Um, looks pretty good, right? Uh, if we press the touch bar play here on",

You want to go to that question? I'm going to set to the way. Yeah, set a waypoint that way. There people, there's a there is a wolf on your ass right now. Oh my God. Oh my, that thing is a dire wolf. Kill him. Get him. No, he's to your left. Where'd he go? It's so he's coming up on your left. It's so dark. Oh, I I see the oh, I heal playing. Ah, so the old snapping of the fingers in place. Dead. Skinning him. That that smoke wagon and go to work. Got me some meat here. Seems a little dark. You're seeing things a lot better than I am.

Is there something we could burn? Maybe a fire or some hibiscus that would get them away from here. Here we go. Like hold down my weapon. Hold on a second. It's not now. It's not a good time. I'm done. There's a wolf on his face right now. You explain that you're using my save and you're an hour and a half, two hours into the game and haven't played any of it. No, why would we do that? People think I'm playing badly. I don't really care. No, I I'm more worried about them thinking the game doesn't explain anything. Hold on L1. Okay, there you go. Now see how it says set on fire.

Well, there's other there's bones and blood. That's why Kevin and I stay away from open plains. All right, so we're almost at the question mark here. There's wolves on your ass. Oh no, they're little kids or jackal. What the hell? Would you like a hyena? Is that a hyena? What is that? It's a do. What a do? I don't know. A zoologist. You know what? There's a wolf.

So it's getting a little lighter here then of Oros is what I've discovered here. This is where this is our waypoint. So it's gone now. All right, let's see what's around here. You can probably ditch the torch now. I think that it is right out. Get that arrow. Shoot this dude in the face when he comes at you. He's coming. Oh, he's gone. He's who are you?

I'm going to uh set this back on fire and see what we can find here. What is this? Meat pack is already full of these items. Great. You don't need any more meat.

We need reeds and some North Cedar to build that. Can we build this? We can build this. So we can build a guts bag and and a bigger arrow quiver. So let's do that. Well, I can't build the guts bag. Guts bag. Guess carries meat. Yeah, it says carried three bait, one meat, and one animal fat. Got it. There's a lot of things we can build. I like the crafting a lot. So how much resource management is involved in this game? Looks like a lot. Yeah, looks pretty cool. There's a lot of depth here. And the skills, we have three different characters.

One vicious traps. Cool. All right, so let's continue to explore. Let's go back to the map. So my question for you, and probably this might be more for Greg, is what is the story? I don't know. Is there a story element? Greg, there must. I mean, there definitely is a story element. There's got to be a plot that's driving you, right? Otherwise you're just kind of like killing these poor senseless animals for what? Up. What is the story? Prehistoric times here. Yeah, you're a dude, right? Start off if you would watch. Let's play Tim and I put up. No big deal. I don't understand why you would have because that was that was the inferior let's play to this let's play clearly. Okay. Uh, you start off.

You to hunted saber-tooth tiger. You meet a woman. You break the news to you that like everything's **** here. They we got some people here who are cannibals. They've invaded our tribal lands. You got to now take it back for them. Okay. So you're on top of the normal Far Cry business of taking down camps, which are now bonfires. You like the bonfire. It becomes part of your thing. You can fast travel to it. Cool.

Next time, Colin, in like the you know, the map system or like, you know, the menu system, you can scroll over and see how they're like all you can get your community up to 300 people at least. Okay. Sorry, we're laughing because Colin just killed two of these dolls and they just slowly rolled down the hell. It's that's how high it goes. But I think you can get higher. All right, so let's at least 300. So **** you, Kevin. I make sure saying correctly. So is this similar to Far Cry 4? I mean, don't you think so just by looking at it? I haven't played Far Cry 4 yet.

No. Yeah, he's howling. He nailed him. Get him again. Shoot him. There you go. Put it through the skull. Oh, now you got some pissed off guys coming. Now you're six feet out. What was in your hands?

I'm actually kind of astounded by how pretty the game is. Like it's very lush. It's very pretty. Low time. There's no load times, which is great. So far when we haven't gone that far.

You think you're going to get into it? Yeah, I mean, I'm you know, I kind of have an itch for an open world game right now. I've been playing some shorter games, some more linear games.
