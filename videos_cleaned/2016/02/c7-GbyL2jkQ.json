            "text": "let's transition over to topic two, E3, how E3 is changing. This is sparked by an article by Jason Schreier over at Kotaku. Electronic Arts is essentially skipping E3 this year, pulling out of the trade show in favor of their own events in Los Angeles and London that will be open to the public. Rather than hosting an E3 press conference and putting up a big flashy booth for trade show attendees, the publisher will hold an event called EA Play that will run from June 12th to June 14th at Club Nokia in Los Angeles, which is like a block away from E3. Yeah, it's right across the street there. And they also plan to hold a one-day event on June 12th at the Mermaid Event Center in London, which sounds awesome. I don't know where that is, it's underwater. Anyway, anyone who wants to attend either event can sign up for more information on the website. EA still plans to hold a press conference, they say, and it's likely we'll see news and trailers for much hyped games like Mass Effect Andromeda and Visceral will",

EA still plans to hold a press conference, they say, and it's likely we'll see news and trailers for much hyped games like Mass Effect Andromeda and Visceral will develop Star Wars. But instead of their traditional spot on Monday afternoon, they're going to hold the press conference on Sunday. EA Play, blah blah blah, they say a whole bunch of other stuff. Um, what do you guys think about this? Fascinating, you know what I mean? Like we talk about all the time over in Publisher Hall, when you walk in, they, it's EA is like the biggest one and it takes up all this space. And there's usually a break in the middle of it, like because it's that big, there's so much happening there. So that's going to be a huge hole to fill over there. And then you start wondering, it's like, well, and I'm the question is, well, can they fill it? Of course they can. But like, are they going to stretch themselves thin? Who all do they let in? How do they do that? You know what I mean? And what does",

You know what I mean? And what does this mean? Are they like the canary in the coal mine of these big companies waking up to the fact of like, we really don't need E3? We should go make our own event. We should have a Bethesda kind of thing. I mean, I personally, I think this is the best call they could have made. Like owning your own event is is the best thing to do. Having fans in the room reacting to the press conference stuff, that's way more important than having, you know, us there. They'll be there. We'll be there. People will be there. Exactly. The people that want to be there will be there. But it's it's way more important than just having people that are just there to just critique and just whatever.

It's like, all right, it's press conference day. It's Ubisoft, it's EA, it's Microsoft, it's Sony. And like, right, like we're excited for Microsoft and Sony and the rest. It's all like, oh, that's cool. What are you going to do? But whatever, like you're you're you're buried on Tuesday's newspaper, whereas Monday morning you get, I mean, because let's face it, I think that Sunday night they come out, they're going to do this whole thing and they're going to **** come out and they're going to be like, this is",

But I just think that this is very similar to the Nintendo thing. And I mean, you disagree about the Directs, but like, I don't think Nintendo needs to be at E3 to still be at E3 in the eyes of millions. Like that's exactly what they're doing. They're actually going to be right there, but they don't need to actually be inside the building to be part of E3 and be part of that buzz and be part of the announcements. And a press conference is a **** press conference no matter what way you you spin it. Even if it's a Nintendo Direct, it's still a **** press conference. All the **** is the",

And in terms of the the space on the floor, I mean, that room is EA and Activision just taking over the whole thing. In the same way that the other room is uh Sony or PlayStation and Xbox just taking over everything. Nintendo actually usually, oh, Nintendo's big ass one. Yeah. Um, you take out uh EA, it's still super crowded over there. Like Activision's just going to be even more of a distraction than previous years. I think. Yeah. I think that um, I thought about this a little bit since since we talked about on Kinda Funny Games Daily today.

Um, so like nothing of real value has been lost by not being at E3. Like they they show Andromeda and all these kinds of things. But they also show like, I remember last year's conference, it's **** awful. Is that what is last year's? When they brought, it was terrible. Like, and they were like, let's talk about, they came out and literally said, let's talk about mobile games. And everyone's like, are you like the, we were with GameSpot in the in their war room and the audible moan. Like, like, oh, like, like this company's just so corporate in so many ways. Like we don't, I just don't find their their, I don't find many of their properties that exciting. So I just don't find their press conferences that exciting unless they show like a new Dead Space. And they'll obviously show Mass Effect, which is exciting. But like, I don't, I like Madden and FIFA is very popular and all that kind of stuff.",

So I from like a a gamer's perspective, from from my own personal taste perspective, I don't really care that they're not going to be there. But I do think it says a lot about the way they look at E3. Um, and I think it says a lot about, you know, candidly, about the waning influence of mainstream games press that um attend E3. EA made a calculation that it's more important for them to, you know, the big thing about this is they're letting in anyone. So E3 is still like this trade show that's easy enough to like get in if you want. Apparently, I've I've always been there with with big outlet.

And then just have, know that the press is going to have to cover their games anyway, than just go to E3 and isolate themselves from that group of people. Because I just think that they realize with the rise of YouTube and the rise of Twitch and the rise of social media, with like just people with just a few thousand Twitter followers can have great influence over the purchasing uh decisions of hundreds of people that trust them. Yeah, I mean, really that's it. It's having a thousand or 3,000 people in a room that are all going to tweet whatever hashtag you tell them to tweet is more important for you than 10 people tweeting about it and probably making",

No, yeah, yeah. So I I do think like, I think that this says a great deal about the direction that the industry is going in, as much as it says about EA's own calculations and EA's own roster of games. Like I think that there's much to be read into this. Um, because I did not expect it. You did not. EA, in fact, I was telling Greg, was like the last company I would expect to leave E3. So if like they're willing to do it, what is Ubisoft going to do? And like next year, and Activision, and all these companies, do they need to be there anymore? And like once everyone starts pulling out, does E3 even exist anymore? Um, is E3 even as important as it was? Because it definitely was on the way for a while and then it came back.

It's more fun to just read about things and watch videos from home than it is to be there. Um, and with the proliferation of social media and getting videos out there and just live streaming and going on Twitch and just doing whatever you want in Nintendo Direct type stuff. But other companies can do that. Um, I think that like the whole nature of these trade shows is going to change, at least for trade shows that are that are sealed off from mass audiences. Games conferences is going to be fine and probably will grow because anyone can go. But E3 either has to change the way it approaches games or hope that EA is like is like not the canary in the coal mine, but just a",

But normal people could go to the same place that EA is doing their thing now and wait in line and get in and see something and be part of this event and get announcements. I mean, the the Nintendo World Championship was essentially like a mini press conference for Nintendo before the Direct where they made announcements and they showed off Mario Maker and made it look **** awesome. Like that sold Mario Maker so much, because before it was just like, all right, that that's fine, that's cool, they're doing it. But that was like, oh, this, that's what you can do with this game.

Because E3 to me, I don't give a **** if it's in one building or 10, as long as there's a week where everyone is trying to one up each other and battle and have that. And more and more people are going to start to back out to do their own things. But I don't think those are mutually exclusive. Like we've seen it with Sony, how many goddamn press conferences did they have last year? Like with PSX and um, they backed out of Gamescom. It's things have changed. The press conference game has totally changed. There's a million conferences all the time. And how do you cover them all? Where do you put your stuff?

You know what I mean? Like how how how how many people can get out in front of the the giant behemoth that is these conferences from Sony, Microsoft, and the Nintendo Direct, right? To get out and have their message be heard and not be drowned out and not have it be that, oh man, Aisha Tyler is not being funny right now. Like not have that be the messaging, right? The messaging be what we thought with saw with Bethesda, which was like, here's this conference and we were excited about everything you said. You know what I mean?

Usually what it is, and we, I think Peter Moore talked about this, and even when we talked about PlayStation, right? Of like, we try to do something for everybody, which inevitably means that you're going to be, oh, P, well, and that's me, you know what I mean? But then I'm excited about one of their games, right? This is what Adam, I think talked about with us about PlayStation.

Like literally at the press conference, instead of spending 0 minutes talking about all the sports games, it could be uh one minute, two-minute thing of, here's our lineup, here's key things that are being added to this year's whatever. Cool. Yeah, you know, mobile games, same thing. Yeah, mobile games don't need to be touched. And I think that that would be my prediction with what they're doing here, right?

Is there any value to even going hands-on with the game before it comes out? Like, is there any, is there really any value to the preview cycle anymore?

Like I don't know necessarily that it's good in the, I mean, it's their prerogative to control anything they want. Um, with their games before they come out. But is it good? Is it good that like they want to avoid the snark? Is it good that they want to avoid the heat of E3? Is it good that they want to cut out the press? Is it good?

Yeah, last week, two weeks ago, when we was that Far Cry Primal event and we walked in there and we brought all our equipment to do, you know, let's play or whatever. But they had a laptop and a camera and a capture station at every station. Like it was like, if you want to do it. And like they had so many YouTube people in there.

I I just I think that this was probably a thoughtful thing that they had to think long and hard about. And I think they did. Um, and because it's not it's not something to take lightly. It's also probably not something that pleased their partners in the in the industry either, like the ESA and stuff like that.

If they come back next year, if it doesn't work out. And then how their success or lack of success influences the other big publishers. Because if two or three more drop out, E3 is done. Like like if two or three, if Activision and then Microsoft decide not to go to E3 anymore, it's over. Yeah, like it's it's just done. So um or Ubisoft and Sony or whatever it is. It can't it can't survive without almost all the big players. Yeah. What do you think about Nintendo, Colin, in terms of conference?
