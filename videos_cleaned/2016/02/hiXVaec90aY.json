I am up for Most Entertaining Online Personality at the South by Southwest Gaming Awards, and it would mean the world to me if you went and voted for me. Of course, every time we win one of these things, it's a win for Kinda Funny, and it's a win for you because we get to go there and be like, hey, people have never heard of us, guess what? People like us. And everybody goes, who are you? And they go, maybe I want to be a best friend, or they're jerks and they say, we'll stay away for everybody. So if you go to KindaFunny.com/SXSW, invoke Greg Miller for Most Entertaining Online Personality. I would take it as a personal favor that I will never, ever be able to repay you for. Topic two of the day: video game music. What are your favorite video game soundtracks? This is open to everybody, but I, I have a feeling you're going to have some good answers here.

Of course, the Mega Man games, uh, two and three are great. Nine is amazing. Um, Castlevania is great too. Um, current stuff, I was, uh, really enjoying the, uh, gosh, uh, Shovel Knight, of course. Uh, pretty much everything Vert does is amazing and, uh, blows me away. Um, the Danny B stuff on Super Meat Boy, NecroDancer's really, really great. Um, so yeah, those are probably my favorites right now. You know, a lot of the newer, I don't know, it seems like the more advanced the game is, the less I pay attention to the music. It's like I expect it to be great, you know, so it's there, it's background music, and it's you, that's the thing right now with modern games. Like, you know what I mean?

It isn't like when you, I was playing Super Mario World before Pinkerton came out, 'cause once Pinkerton came out, I listened to that on repeat playing Super Mario. But before that, you know what I mean? When you knew every, every beat of that song, and it was so much part of the game, right? See, I have a totally different experience with that where I still notice the music in games, like in current games, like Final Fantasy, they're still just as standout to me, and the moments are still like, I identify them. When I think about a certain sequence in a game, I hear the music in my head. Uncharted, definitely the same way.

Immediately what comes to mind is, uh, uh, Gone Home and Firewatch, and I think both of those games are because it's slower, I'm walking, I'm taking, the whole thing is observing your entire environment, whereas like, you know, it's like in Metal Gear, right?

Like that's an awesome moment and sticks with me, but it's because like control is taken away and it's like I'm watching a movie cinematic thing. I mean, I think even MGSV is a good example because Metal Gear to me, the music always has been kind of a, a big, a big deal, and like it is tied to sequences and stuff. And Metal Gear Solid V, because it's more open, it has less of those moments, but when it does happen, and every time the, it's like, yeah, and um, and that, that like when that Peace Walker theme kind of comes back and like those moments are always, it's great, you know, and I'm like, oh, game music still, sure, like very, very much a thing.

Like they got so creative with the use of the, the, the chiptunes and all that stuff. Like, yeah, that, I mean, that's the interesting thing to me is that, and that's why I, I, I love talking to you because the Mega Man, like Mega Man 3, my favorite game of all time, I mean, all our audience knows that, but um, there's something about the Mega Man music in especially two, three, and then parts of four, parts of five, parts of six, then nine, I think really killed it. And 10 was pretty good too. But that's so much better than everything else around it.

But Mega Man is so much better than everything else. Say that. I, I like, I, I, I think that that's like, I, I just, I can agree with you. I just think there's just, there's just something about like the way those, those songs by the time they get the six, I always think of Flame Man's song in Mega Man 6. Like that song is insanely complicated for the NES. I don't even know how they, how they do like, do that with the chipset in, in the NES. And I'm, I guess I'm kind of wondering with you, like, how do you identify, for instance, you did Wily, which is my favorite song of yours. That's, that's a, that's Mega Man, Wily Stage 1, um, and Stage 2. But um, how do you identify like what song? Because they're all really great. So it's like you're going through a game and do you, did you hear at that point,",

So it's like you're going through a game and do you, did you hear at that point, like I can slow this down, I put a beat behind this, and it's usually the ones that are stuck in my head forever, you know? And um, I remember making the first Mega Ran album in 2007 and asking my producer like, what do you think of this? And it was the, the Bomb Man theme, and he's like, no. And he didn't, he didn't think I could do anything with it. And so I, I ignored it and just didn't do it. But then later when we did the anniversary edition, I said, I'm going to Bomb Man. I'm going to, I'm going to make this work. So I think it's more about, most of that music is so good that I think you can, you can make it work. And if you're skilled enough at, you know, the production style of sampling, chopping, splicing, slowing down, you can almost make anything awesome, you know?

So I don't know, it's usually the, I pick my favorites. I'm like, no, we got to do Bubble Man. Like, I love that, you know? So I like, you got to do this, you know? So tracks that I really love were the ones that I went to first. Wily was the opposite because if you've ever been to a video game music festival or heard any video game music covers, everyone does Wily. Everyone. It's that Ice Cap Zone from Sonic 3. Yeah, pretty much. Uh, or um, Sonic, uh, Chemical Plant, which I love. And it's like everyone does it, so you can't go anywhere without hearing it.

And, uh, and there was someone saying, well, do you like the Wily theme? I was like, yes, I love it. Like, well, then why should you let that stop it? And, uh, and that was the conversation that I, I needed to hear. It's like, if you like it and you love it and you can't, you know, get it out of your head, then you should work with it, not worrying about what someone else has done. You're going to have your, your unique spin on it. And, uh, a lot of people tell me it's their, their favorite song that I've done in, you know, in the Mega Man Universe. You told a story in it as well that doesn't even tell. I still Wily, uh, Stage 1 in Mega Man 3, I think, is, is awesome. And, and Wily in Mega Man 10, Stage 1, she was super emotional and weird.

Like I'm like, there's a weird emotion in this song. I'm like, this is kind of weird. I don't know if they even meant it like this. What's cool does something that I think a couple of their franchise, specifically old ones, do where there, there is, you immediately can identify that it's Mega Man, you know? And even when they do kind of shift the gears and like make it more emotional or slower or whatever, it still feels like Mega Man. And it's weird because it's not like they're using instruments, you know? It's there, it's just using the chipset stuff. But um, Mega Man has that. Sonic has it.

You can hear a new version of those, you're like, that's a Sonic song. You know, Pok\u00e9mon's the same way with the, um, with battle themes. Like all the battle themes sound very similar, but that's just because they, they, they nailed the aesthetic of this is a random encounter and, you know, the whatever, it's always going to sound similar. And Mario, you know, you, you can hear the new Mario Overworld and Underworld themes, and you know that it's Mario Overworld, Underworld. You know that this is the underwater song. You know that this is the castle song. And it's like there's a an artistry to that that's like blows my mind.

And I don't mean that in a bad way, just like the games, you know, it's the same thing over and over, but they kind of can really create, um, Mega Man is kind of like the badass guitar solos of NES games where every single soundtrack, it's sound like there's so many layers to it, so many things going on, whereas Mario was always just like, there's the main melody, there's a rhythm, and there's bass, and that's it. Whereas Mega Man was like all over the **** place. And Sonic was the same way. Yeah, then you get into things like Final Fantasy, and that's when **** gets real, you know? Nobuo is insane.

Like the, the way in Final Fantasy IV when the Red Wings are flying in the beginning or whatever, and it's like, it's like, it's like, it's iconic. Like, and like, you don't need it to sound any better than it sounded there. So like when they remix them and they play them orchestrally and they do them live, and I'm like, that's great, but like actually the original version is actually probably better than this, you know? I see, I don't agree. I think that there the composition is so good that whether it is this primitive version or it's a full **** 60-piece orchestra, I think that the, the sound still there.

But I also think that like, in my mind, it fits the, um, uh, the aesthetic. Like when they remade Final Fantasy IV for 3D for DS, I, I was like, it's kind, I played it and I liked it 'cause I liked it. It was like way harder than the original one. It was as hard as it was supposed to be. But like that, that chibi style, like that, I was like, this kind of sucks, sucks. Like this doesn't, this doesn't, this doesn't fit the way, you know, Porom and Palom committing suicide to save the rest of the party in the game, or so you think, with their, with their sprites or whatever, is like way more resonant with the chiptune and the 16-bit sprite than it was with these chibi, weird looking, shitty DS graphics, you know what I mean?

Like I'm talking about when you get to like PS3, PS4 quality stuff, like that's when it's really like on another level. Like Final Fantasy XV is going to be **** awesome because like the music for the one of the, I mean, XIII even had it where the music was at that level where there wasn't orchestral versions, it was orchestral music, you know? Final Fantasy X kind of did it, but then it was still this like weird MIDI awkward. Like Final Fantasy VII through X was the awkward stage of this isn't actual orchestra music, it's like synthesizers.

No, it was a glancing thing. Yeah, exactly. But like they were always there, there were always, there was always, you know, I, I, I've been listening to hip-hop for a really long time too, and like I always felt like the, the communities were somewhat kind of intertwined in some way. And but um, you know, one of my favorite rappers now is the last few years is Currensy, and I found him because he rapped about Mega Man 3 in one of his songs, and someone told me about that like, and just it wasn't like a joke, like, like it was a joke, but it was like straight up like just part of his rap about how he was stealing someone's girlfriend and bringing her to",

Like that was like what the whole voice was about. That is amazing. And I was like, and I was like, all right, that's awesome. But then I was listening to his newest record, and I didn't even notice this. Tim had pointed out to me that on his song \"No Squares,\" like it's a God of War III sample. Like the S and, and um, how do you feel about, you know, having your niche where it's dedicated to this? How do you feel about some of the bleed over that seems to be more, more becoming more predominant, not predominant, but more noticeable in mainstream?

Look at hip-hop and video games working together. And we're like, wait, we, we've been doing this, you know, for a long time. And, um, and yeah, it's, I think it's cool, you know? But, uh, it wasn't cool when I started, you know? And I feel like it was something that, you know, you, like you said, there have always been that, that occasional glancing side mention, like, hey, I shoot you like Mega Man or something, some weird metaphorical use.

Uh, it's good to be known for something than nothing. Um, but at the same time, I look at the bigger guys that do it. Uh, I think it's awesome. I think it's great when, you know, Logic released an album that was hosted by Steve Blum, you know, where he got the voice of Spike Spiegel on his record, you know, on a major hip-hop release. And I thought that was awesome. So, so things like that, I think slowly you'll see a little more and more crossover of it. And I think that, um, it can only be a good thing. I think it's, we're still, we're work hard to legitimize what we're doing basically because people are like, okay, he's rapping about Mega Man, but wait, wait, wait, wait, it's actually good, you know?

So I think it's cool, you know, when I see major label guys or major like Currensy is really good at it, and he's into, he's into all the fandoms that I'm into. He does wrestling tracks, he does, you know, the video game mentions, you know? So I think it's okay, and you'll see more and more of it with, you know, with artists getting younger and younger.

So, so yeah, I think it's awesome, you know? But I, I did a lot of research on it when I did a couple panels at PAX about video games and hip-hop, and just noticing that the time period is almost identical. Late '70s, you know, first video game, late '70s, first hip-hop. Um, both dismissed as fads, you know, as things that are going to just go away really soon. Both multi-million or billion dollar industries at this point. So I think that, um, them with them both happening at the same time, it's only right, you know, only makes sense that they'll cross over a little bit here and there, you know?

Yeah, there's no reason to just tip your foot in there when, when you know, if it was a big part of your upbringing, you know, just we all played Tecmo Bowl or Zelda or Metroid or things like that. So, so, uh, you know, and I'm glad that, you know, like I said with the Final Fantasy stuff, I didn't think that everyone felt as special about this as I did, but, you know, it's a cool thing that they did. Yeah, I think there's a cool, you know, reverse thing that happens too, where, yeah, we all played Tecmo Bowl, we all played Zelda, so when you hear these things, it resonates with us. But for me, like there's been times where I've heard samples from songs that I know are from video games. I'm like, I don't know what this is, but then I fall in love with the music and I'm like, I want to go back and play it. Um, I",

Yeah, and I didn't know what that was from, but I was like, this beat is, this is awesome. Like, I know this is a video game because they're saying round one, they're doing all that stuff. And I remember looking into it, and that's why I played Soulcalibur. I'm like, I **** love this. And then the same thing, like I never played the Mega Man games till I heard \"Grow Up.\" I'm like, this song is awesome. I need to go back and get on this stuff. And then I started playing them, and it's just, I, I, I also grew up listening to hip-hop, loving it, and loving video games. So I remember, I've told the story before, but like for me, going on the GameFAQs rapping hip-hop boards, like I was just constantly anytime there was a",

And it's, it's awesome to see that like it was such a niche thing, but then there would always be guys like Eminem like randomly doing it. You know, what do you think of, um, I mean, you last time we saw you, I think, or maybe two times ago, you were with Danimal who does Morck. Um, what do you think about kind of the interpretation, like the rock interpretations of, um, you know, gaming music, music as well? Because I remember being, you know, in high school in the late '90s, listening to Nimis and and The Minibosses and stuff like that. So yeah, and so how do you feel about that?
