Mack Weldon believes in smart design, premium fabrics, and simple shopping. We did it, it was easy. We just tried to get some underwear, went on that website, bam, next thing you know we got it and it is premium. Oh, I am liking it. It is soft on my body. All the products are naturally antimicrobial, which means they eliminate odor. I didn't know it, I had to look it up too. They want you to be comfortable, so if you don't like your first pair, you can keep it and they will still refund you, no questions asked. Not only does Mack Weldon's underwear, socks, and shirts look good, they perform well too. It's good for working out, going to work, going on dates, you know, just everyday life, going about your thing. It's even good for podcasting. I know that because I'm wearing them right now.

So we're going to go from birth to like now, to now. All right, well, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, West Philadelphia, born and raised. In front of the TV is where I spent most of my days. Um, so basically just, you know, growing up a fan of video games for a long, long time and a fan of hip-hop at the same time and just watching both of them rise around the same time and me just really wanting to get caught up in that, that, uh, you know, both of those cultures. And, um, I started writing music, uh, I guess as a teenager and it took me maybe 10 years of writing music until I figured, let me try to inject some of those games that I love into the music.

They like, under no circumstance. They embarrassed me. No, um, no, they were okay with it and they decided to let me keep making music and they, um, you know, encouraged me to make more Mega Man tunes. And so I did that. Then I went to other, um, you know, franchises that I really loved, Final Fantasy, um, all kinds of stuff, River City Ransom, mostly retro things. So I think I've then, uh, fallen into a bit of a, I guess, a niche or subgenre called nerdcore, uh, also another called chiptune. So I put those together and what I call it is Chip-Hop. It's a little bit of both, you know, chiptune hip-hop, Chip-Hop. That's my thing. Yeah. So now right now, let's see, I am in San Francisco, uh, on a tour with my good friend",

Well, yeah, so what, what does the tour look like then? Like, what does it look like this current tour? I mean, it's been just, um, you know, into a city for a day, usually, you know, playing a show, getting to maybe eat some food and shake hands with people that are in the town and then we play a great show and usually we have to go to the next city.

Now, that's the thing you're talking about these clerical duties and these emails you have to do. I would assume you have thousands of people who do these things for you. You're a big time rapper.

And, um, one of, I was in Salt Lake and, uh, the guy who put the show together was like, I think I know one of your ex-students. Like, one of your old students moved from Phoenix to Salt Lake and I know him. And I couldn't remember the name. And, uh, but I was like, that's very possible.

Um, but yeah, absolutely. They would find stuff. So then I eventually had to, um, just insert it into the classroom as much as I could. I would show them videos of mine. I would, I would then get into even running songs by them. Like, hey, I got this new song I'm working on here. Just listen to it, you know. And they enjoyed it.

So, um, so I would run music by them. We would do Freestyle Fridays where I would rap for them. If they all got a really good score on their test, I would do, uh, some raps for them. So I would have them all hold up their items that they had in their in their desk and I'd go around the classroom just rapping about them, pencils, pens, whatever. And, um, and they enjoyed that. They had a blast. Or I would use their spelling words into the rhyme. And, uh, and they, they loved it. That's awesome. That is so cool. You'd be the coolest teacher.

It's one of my favorite songs ever. Wow. And then I listened to that and this was before the Mega Ran album even came out. And then you had another album before that. I did The Call. The Call. Yes.

And I didn't know what that call was, you know. And then things started getting clear after making that record. But yeah, I think it was IGN who was the first. It probably IGN's fault that Capcom scared the hell out of me because, um, they posted it and next thing you know, I had an email on MySpace the very like same day. And they're like, so, uh, what are you doing here, you know. And I'm like, oh boy. Naturally, you think like, this is something that's going to ruin you, you know. And, uh, but they were fortunately like fans of what I was doing and they thought it was well done. They thought it was tasteful. They thought it was appropriate.

So that's definitely one of those first signs you see where you're like, maybe you're on to something. And now you have to, you know, have the courage to just kind of keep pushing, trying something else and until things stick. So I remember with Capcom, they've been really good about stuff. Then you did Mega Ran 9 after that. And then after that, you did the Marvel vs. Capcom like vinyl hip-hop stuff. That was awesome.

And can they both coexist? And, um, I think that they can. And I've, I've finally discovered a happy medium where I can make songs like Infinite Lives on the new record where the concept is is video game related but applying it to everyday life so that everyone can understand it, realize it. So even it took 10 years for me to realize that these guys can live together side by side and on the same record because what I would do is try to alternate like, all right, here's a Random album, here's a Mega Ran album, here's a Random album, here's a Mega Ran album.

And the Mega Ran albums would get so much more attention probably because of the games that they were, you know, sampling from. So I, I just tried to find a way where I could inject my own life story, my own, you know, lessons and things like that into a, uh, into a track that may also, you know, reflect those video games that I grew up playing. So where did Black Materia fall then? So Black Materia was like the second project after, I guess, after the first two Mega Man albums. So there was Mega Ran and Mega Ran 9. Uh, and then Black Materia was 2011. And, um, and that was the one that kind of took off for me. And, um, I remember one day getting a phone call from a friend who said, hey, you're on the first page of Reddit. And back in 2011, I didn't even know what that meant. So I was like, what are you talking about? And, uh, he's like, that means it's a",

I did a bunch of big interviews. And, um, and had a big tour right after that. And then, uh, MC Chris asked me to join him on tour. And we did a three-month tour of the entire U.S. And I think so it was definitely the Black Materia album that kind of jumped it off. And I didn't realize, you know, I knew Final Fantasy VII was special to me, but I didn't necessarily know it was, you know, as special to everyone else. Yeah, no, I, I love that album so much. Tell the people what that project is.

And I'm like, I need another crack at that album, which is why announcement, we're going to be releasing a vinyl version of Black Materia later this year, which will be the songs remixed and remastered. It's the reboot, the reboot, Final Fantasy VII Reboot. Yeah, it's the reboot, something like that.
