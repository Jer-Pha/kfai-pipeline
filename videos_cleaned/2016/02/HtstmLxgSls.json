I am up for Most Entertaining Online Personality at the South by Southwest Gaming Awards, and it would mean the world to me if you went and voted for me. Of course, every time we win one of these things, it's a win for Kinda Funny, and it's a win for you because we get to go there and be like, \"Hey, people have never heard of us. Guess what? People like us.\" And everybody goes, \"Who are you?\" And they go, \"Maybe I want to be a best friend.\" Or they're jerks and they say, \"We'll stay away for everybody.\" So if you go to KindaFunny.com/SXSW, invoke Greg Miller for Most Entertaining Online Personality. I would take it as a personal favor that I will never, ever be able to repay you for. Final topic of the day, as always, brought to you by the Kinda Funny Forums. Go to KindaFunny.com/GamescastTopic to leave your topic for us to read in the show, just like Boiled Frog did. He says, \"We all love video games.

Is it multiplayer-only games? Games without multiplayer? Open-world games? Linear games? Bad graphics? Great graphics? Bad gameplay? Great gameplay? I hate great gameplay, sloppy. I want to clip through the floor. Uh, great story, but lore is too deep? Episodic game? All like, there's a couple good things there, though. I think the great story but the lore being too deep is a is a daunting thing that I wouldn't necessarily think about. But getting into a game like for someone that hasn't played a Final Fantasy and looking at Final Fantasy 15 and not knowing like what you need to know and not, that could be pretty intimidating. I mean, that's why you see games like Witcher when it came out.",

It was Witcher Wild Hunt, even though they had the three behind it, but they were pushing away from that so that new people would be like, \"Oh, cool, play this.\" Yeah, same thing like Infamous Second Son, right? Let's start dropping numbers, let's start things new, start things fresh, get people in there. Tutorials, man, like you hate tutorials. Ah, like I I really do. I I hate, it's less so the tutorial, like I can deal with it. I understand like that's just how games need to be these days. It needs to have that like introduction thing that you just keep hitting A or X to skip through. But I hate it when it's tutorial sections. Twilight Princess and Kingdom Hearts, my God, why are the first three to five hours of these games like, \"Here's how you play this game,\" and \"Here's this",

That trying to run through. I I installed a whole bunch of stuff on my PS4 recently. Was playing one of them recently. They had a really bad tutorial section where it was one of those things where it's like, \"If you would just let me go and play the game, I'd figure it all on my own.\" But it was like one of those like, \"Hold up, hold up, hold up. Now you're going to be times you have to hold R1 and hit...\" They're like, \"What the ****? Just let me go!\" You know what I mean? \"I'll be fine.\" But like, it was like making you go every time and try it, and then go to the next part and try it, and then go to the next.

Yeah, the games that have tutorials that you don't even know you're playing the tutorial are the best, are, you know, the most clever. And back in the day, talk about Mario Stage One and all those kinds of things, the the idea of of that game telling you exactly how to play. Not that that that game's complicated compared to games today, it's not. Um, no, I think that uh, emphasis to me, I was talking about some this on our Reddit uh AMA that we did, um, where someone asked me like, \"Is resolution or frame rate more important?\" And I'm like, \"Well, frame rate is probably way more important because it actually is gameplay related.\" But um, are some of the gaming communities' um overemphasis on technical specs is infuriating to me. Um, if a game's not, if a game's running at 30 frames a second, it's garbage. If it's running in 900p or 720p, it's garbage. It's like, \"Who gives a ****?\" Like, is is like the is the game",

It's like, \"Who gives a ****?\" Like, is is like the is the game good? Is the game fun? You know, I still say River Raid is like one of my favorite games of all time on Atari 2600. That game is like the most, one of the most basic things, everything, but it's fun. Who cares what it looks like? It's the more I could make that **** game probably now if you just gave me like a little bit of a tutorial on how to code and stuff like that. It's not complicated, it's just fun. There's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't mean that like things don't have to look like Witcher 3 Wild Hunt to be fun. In fact, Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is fun, but it's also in my mind way too dense and way too big, you know? Like, and so like I think that we we look at things as as like technical specs, scope, gameplay, length, all these kinds of things. And I'm like, \"No, no, no, this doesn't make a game",

Is a tighter 8-hour experience like Journey more resonant than uh the 50 hours it takes to get to the good part of Final Fantasy 13? You know, so I think that like we as a Gaming Community rely generally on these weird things. It's not to say it's like we were talking about, I don't know, maybe it was on the show last week, like, \"What about PlayStation 4 makes a game better other than its technical specs?\" Nothing. There there's nothing that PlayStation 4 is doing that PlayStation 3 couldn't do in terms of like games, you know? It's just like we have to just slow our roll a little bit and realize like maybe like let's just look at games in a more mechanical standpoint, a",

It doesn't. I hate unskippable cutscenes. Why would you want to skip the cutscenes? Because if it's before a boss fight and I freaking die three times, one, I what I drives me crazy with unskippable cutscenes is when it crashes or something happens or there's no save point on the other side and you come back and you have to sit through. I'm saying like when you lose the boss fight, you have to keep going. Kingdom Hearts, like freaking Riku, the third fight with him, you had to freaking, it was so hard and then I kept dying.

I like having subtitles because I like knowing exactly what people are saying and um it's it it's so stupid to me when it's just not an option. Yeah, also games that don't let you button map are annoying. Not that I remap buttons often, but there are times when you want to and like I just don't understand this this orthodoxy towards like, \"This is the way you play it.\" It's like, \"Well, why can't I play it the way I want to play?\" It's a similar mantra to like being able to skip cutscenes. It's like, \"Well, why would you want to skip them?\" It's like, \"None of your **** business. I'm playing the game.\" You know what I mean? So like, it's my game now.

But um I really don't feel that in 2016 we should that should be an issue and um and it is way too much for me. Um trying to play WWE 2K16 and it's like, \"Do you want to change your guy's eyebrows?\" Yeah, I know, now loading five minutes, you know? So um yeah, those are the worst. The loads that like not something that's buried on the other side of a load screen even, but yeah, for a simple, you know, creation thing, it's just like, \"Oh, boy.\" Um I I'd like, I don't know. Um I was just thinking of something when you were talking. Oh, just like the forcing multiplayer. I'm not a big fan of that.

Mya Luke says, \"Hey guys, I'm a new user in the Kinda Funny Forums because my friends and girlfriend told me you guys have a forum and a question thread, so I made an account just to join the community and support your Patreon page. Thank you, thank you very much.\" So my question is, \"Do you believe Atlus might push back Persona 5 this year because of Final Fantasy 15?\" No, no, yeah, no. Atlus ain't scared. If anybody, it seemed like Square was scared when they put out that survey or whatever. Yeah, I don't think they have anything to be scared. That game's that game will drop.

I I just can't imagine that it'll come out in Japan, though. It'll come out um for sure. Yeah, I don't I mean, my theory, and it might be crazy, is that Persona will probably outsell Final Fantasy, at least in Japan. I I don't know that it will it will happen here necessarily, but it won't. Um, but Persona is still good for a few million in the West. Um, so F maybe not, but Persona making that kind of cosmic jump, um, that Quantum Leap, as it were, from 3 to 4 to 5, where it's really relevant now. Um, because Persona was floating around um localized on in North American PS1s back in the day. No one gave a **** about that game. So it's like it's interesting seeing, you know, how how much how far that's come. I think that game is good for good for many sales regardless of when it comes up.

Where I think Persona is like, everyone's like, \"That's going to be amazing, don't worry about it.\" And Final Fantasy has so much to prove. Yeah, but it's still going to sell. That's the thing. Azrael 6 says, \"Hey guys, what do you think Amy Hennig's Star Wars game will be? Narrative-driven third-person?\" It'll be like Uncharted in the Star Wars Universe, which I can't wait for. Yeah, that that is excellent. The Almighty Fui, that's a good name, great name, nice. Rumors are saying that Namco's going to be launching the NX with Smash Bros.

I think that they will. I think that they have to. Um, and I'm very excited that this is a thing 'cause I want this game to just keep keep going. They've been doing so great so far. Coming out today, very excited to play with some Bayonetta. But uh yeah, it's I I think that that's uh it has to happen. It's one of those things that I'm like, \"It's too good to be true. Nintendo wouldn't do that.\" But we've seen so much rumors now that uh point towards it that I think it it is undeniably happening.
