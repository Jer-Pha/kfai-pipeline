I am up for Most Entertaining Online Personality at the South by Southwest Gaming Awards, and it would mean the world to me if you went and voted for me. Of course, every time we win one of these things, it's a win for Kinda Funny, and it's a win for you because we get to go there and be like, \"Hey, people have never heard of us. Guess what? People like us.\" And everybody goes, \"Who are you?\" And they go, \"Maybe I want to be a best friend.\" Or they're jerks and they say, \"We'll stay away for everybody.\" So if you go to KindaFunny.com/SXSW and vote Greg Miller for Most Entertaining Online Personality, I would take it as a personal favor that I will never, ever be able to repay you for. My topic, yeah, is that we need to get everyone on board with the Aerobics Championship of 1987. F*** yes, we do. Now, this has been, you be 1987, '88, '89. Yeah, well, that's the thing is like, it's been a slow build. I wasn't here on the, I was at Colin & Greg Live where this originally",

I, I don't know who's on the show, and I were on it, and it was one of those things where someone said, \"Hey, you have to watch this video.\" So of course, Mr. Moriarty responded, \"F*** you, we're never watching this video because you told me we had to.\" And then within the same breath, I was like, \"Are you sure?\" He goes, \"I will watch it.\" And we watched it, and you know how sometimes Colin is so pleasantly surprised that he's overtaken with joy and he actually like smiles? He smiles and laughs. Holy f***, it was like, but it was like butterflies were sprouting extra wings to fly. Angels were like coming down and washing people's cars and bikinis. It was a whole f***ing moment for us that you missed 'cause you were f***ing off running your drug empire doing so. Yeah, but what was funny is I",

Wait, you'd seen Key & Peele did a spoof video on? You'd seen the spoof video? So this video was not based on it. Key & Peele was based on this, right? I'm sorry, thank you. So, so I was like, \"Oh, they're playing this awesome Key & Peele video.\" And then it kept going and I was like, \"This is not the Key & Peele video. This is something holy different. This is something beautiful and pure and from my time, my time, the '80s.\" Right? This is our time. Our time. No, this is your time, not mine. You were born in the '80s. Yeah, I know, but I don't, I don't remember. I mean, I remember Ghostbusters. You remember those? You remember leotards? You remember Jazzercise? I remember shitty ass TV like this. Yeah, like",

I mean, that's like, so that's the other level of it. And if you think that, if you, for those of you either actually was watching at home, you can't see the visual on this, it doesn't f***ing matter because this song goes on for another four and a half minutes. So what is, what is the Google search for that? That's nine seconds in. This is what it sounds like. Two, two, two minutes and 13 seconds. So right, so what's the background on this? This is the, the Crystal Light Aerobic Championship, right? And it went on for three. Was this a thing in your life? I don't remember this. I don't, I remember Crystal Light, obviously.

If I'm, if I remember Crystal Light stuff, like you buy in packets of like powder and then you pour it in, you pour your own water in and that becomes Crystal Light, right? Thought I'm sure they make bottled stuff now too. Um, is it a squirt thing? It's a squirt thing. I just remember Crystal Light being not Coke and so I didn't give a f*** about it. The f*** why I do this just because it's the '80s and that's what brand they sponsored things. Sure. I mean, it's the same now, right? Like we'll Sprint will sponsor an E3 show for IGN, right? Crystal Light, they literally say Crystal Light 10,000. Yeah, that was, that was part, build it beautiful. We do the same thing now. Squarespace, we do it once a video.

The most notable of them is Alan Thicke. Everyone else falls very, very short of Alan Thicke. Raquel Welch is on there. Yeah, that's true. There's one where she is on there, but she's fitness expert Raquel Welch, not star of stage and screen Raquel Welch. She was totally missb built. So I'm very interested by this because I didn't, I was, I missed this episode of Colin & Greg Live. I didn't really know about it when I was out there. I heard you guys playing and laughing and I'm like, \"All right, whatever.\" Then on the stream, we watched it and, and this is what happened is we start listening, then you, you guys realized that it wasn't just one year, there was multiple years, three years in a row.

And then we get to the point where you find a different year and Colin gets super excited 'cause he's like, \"Oh, they're using a different song.\" And then, \"Oh my God, we haven't heard that sick guitar riff.\" This is, this is '87. '87 is when they hired Slash to f***ing laid down a guitar track. '86, but it says '87. That's miss build. And we discovered there's lyrics. Yeah. Oh my God, so good. But they tried to switch you up 'cause they, they have different intros. They pretend for like 30 seconds that it's not the song. I was losing my mind. It was so funny. I don't remember which one it was. I don't remember either, but it must have been '89. It must have been the last one. People, people got to just, just go search for the, just, just go down.

Synchronized dancing. Is that what aerobics is? I, that is aerobics. Yeah, United States. So we're like, \"This doesn't sound like the song.\" Right into the real song. The other one was way more convincing. They one by one introduce the people and it's like, \"Hey!\" And then like they have this like circle camera come and Tommy comes in on him. It's f***ing amazing. Do like the freeze. Oh, it's so good. But, but the camera doesn't do the freeze. The guy does the freeze. So he just stops dancing for a second and then goes back into it.

You know, Jazzercise was a thing where it was like that where you would get taught sort of a routine or whatever and every class you would be like, \"Up, down, left, 10K.\" And you do it, but it was to music and it was fun and it got people moving around and people wore like tights and like the leg warmers. But I don't remember it being an actual national sport. I don't remember ever hearing about this being on TV. You have known. How is this championship a championship? I don't know. Is endurance?

And they do, they do like testimonial interviews with not the people, but with their friends. So while they're dancing, and this is the funniest part, is it's like they're dancing and they don't take that off, but there's a little circle that comes on the screen and it's just like, \"That's my friend Billy. He's dancing and I hope he wins this. He's doing great.\" It's like, \"Am I supposed to be watching them dance or listening to this guy talk about Billy?\" I mean, first of all, Billy was the truth. Guys, we're five months, one day, four hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds from the International Aerobic Competition of 2016. It returns to Las Vegas. Shut the front door. Get up.

What's that right there? That's the Junior Division Showcase. Goldman, Goldman, L. Uh oh, the song. They look like they've lost the song. What if it start out? I'm f***ing, it's hosted by Kirk Cameron. Yeah, these kids are just getting. Ashley Johnson's got to get up in there. Oh, we should get her to host it. So what do we do with this information, Tim? Just go watch it. I have to imagine that there was choreographed dance sequences later that they got judged on. I have to imagine that's what the competition is. It's like groups go. Yeah.
