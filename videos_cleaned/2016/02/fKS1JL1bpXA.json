All right. Alex Osborn over at IGN says apparent Nintendo NX related reports have surfaced offering a handful of potential clues as to what the company has planned for its next console. According to a post on Twitter by The Wall Street Journal reporter Takashi something, Nintendo's next console may work with other devices including PCs, smartphones and most interestingly, other consoles like PlayStation 4.

And if you look at the little document, it actually also says Xbox One, but that's okay. Additionally, an apparent survey from GfK, a client of Nintendo, has surfaced online by way of Twitter user Liam Robertson, providing new details about Nintendo NX. In addition to mentioning connectivity between a handheld and console unit, the survey also highlights an achievement based system, 4K 60 FPS video streaming and quote, gameplay graphics that run in 900p at 60 FPS. According to the rest of the survey provided by Twitter user Emily Rogers, Nintendo's console may have a free online service as well as a subscription option that includes more features for a yearly s/m monthly fee.

Oh yeah. The second part of the survey also mentions a subscription based game service that offers access to a library of over 150 titles that are changed regularly with new games added to the catalog 6 to 18 months after their release. The remainder of the survey compares various price options, hard drive configurations and more across an array of different game platforms including NX, Xbox One, PS4 and other stuff. And other stuff. Yeah, there's also rumors. Uh, people are talking about, um, there being an event before E3 that kind of announces the and like blows that out and then E3 is the real like, you know, let's look at the games.

And they're like, no, if a Metroid Prime was to be made, it would take three to four years to be made and it would be for the NX. So, 'cause as Reggie said, we know what you want. We know what you want. We know what kind of Metroid game you want. We're not ready to give it to you yet, but NX will give it to you. He didn't say that part, but he's thinking it though. They're waiting for E3 for that. They'll do the little event first and then at E3, DMX is going to come out. DMX, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, on the Nintendo Direct.

It's, it was interesting to see how far these rumors made it based on just a survey. You know what I mean? Uh, we didn't talk about it. There was a rumor going around of possibly having the handheld version of or handheld component of the NX out this fall and then the console component out next year sometime, which would be so stupid and you hope that doesn't happen. Yeah. Um, I hope it does. Just going to be funny that they would actually do that, but I want them to succeed. So, we're Team NX here. The connectivity between the PC makes sense.

I mean, that, that's the part that makes the least sense to me because I just don't, I can't even wrap my head around what that could mean because right now, yeah, you can, you know, look up Nintendo account stuff on your PS4.

It would be great. What do you think? Like what do you think the connectivity between the, the things could be? I don't know. When I saw, when I saw that, I, I, I agree that, you know, this is weird.

It's similar to how like Greg and I know a lot of things are true that we can't talk about, but sometimes we talk like more confidently about the things that could happen because we know they're true. So like I, I wonder if, um, if there's something to that when someone from Wall Street Journal, um, is talking about his connections, uh, telling him this, this, the other thing. And then there's the survey. And then Emily Rogers, who you said Emily Rogers was one of the people you brought up, right? Um, who has broken many things about Nintendo in the past.

When I first heard the PS4 thing, I'm like, that's really brilliant. It's basically like middleware almost between, um, like, uh, the eShop and like these platforms. And maybe even PlayStation and Microsoft announced that they'll run this sort of Nintendo. It'll be, it'll be an app you can get. But I don't think that's what it is. I, I think, I think at the very least what it probably is is something like what Rocket League does, which is talks to PC and PS4 at the same time. And I'm wondering if like they just have all this information saying like, we're, we're not going to close the console off to communicating with other consoles, but we still have to play the NX itself to play NX games or whatever. Because, um, I just don't see that they're going to, because if what if they're saying is true, then it's basically them just going third party and what the hell is",

It's basically just like EA Access or something like that where you have like this, this subscription model. So I just, uh, I'm, I was excited to see more information about NX, but then I was disappointed because I'm like, this just makes it even more convoluted. Like that the waters are even muddy. Like, like I just don't, I just don't know like what all this means. But I do think that some of it or maybe even all of it is true in some sense. We just don't know like to the degree of like how true it is. Because you can say like, uh, EA has a subscription thing on Xbox One. The NX could just be a similar thing again, um, having that on its own console and maybe it has a game like Rocket League that will just talk to the other consoles too. Yeah. Um, instead of really closing",

Um, instead of really closing themselves off because Nintendo obviously always has this very closed off ecosystem. So I think that like we could either be reading way too much into it or we might not be reading enough into it. Yeah. Um, well, something that I think is interesting is the fact that they say that new games will be added to the catalog 6 to 18 months after their release. So a, a possible option would be that the old games, the Mario original trilogy on NES and like Super Nintendo games, N64 games or whatever, those could be subscription servers playable to everybody. But the point of having the NX is kind of like our Patreon model where if you want it early, if you want to play the new game when it comes out, you need the NX. But if you wait 18 months or whatever, then you can get it another place. That idea is like",

Because if it's, it's the Tomb Raider effect, right? Like Tomb Raider didn't really seem to push any Xbox Ones and it didn't sell very well because people are excited to play it. But the reason Square and Microsoft wanted to keep it quiet that it was coming to PS4 is because like, no, like if you just have to wait a year to play Tomb Raider and you have all these other games to keep you distracted, are you going to need the hardware at all? So if Mario Galaxy 3 comes out or whatever and, and it's, and it's on NX and you have to wait a year to play it on PS4 through some sort of subscription service, how many people are just going to be like, all right, well, I think the easier way to go would be that the NX is what we're talking about.",

Where it's like, let's say you have the NX and you, there's this, so there's the NX console in this, I'm just going to call it the NX app, right? The NX app could give you on PlayStation and Xbox a random selection that you're subscribed to. And so for like three months, right? All these Nintendo games are on there, but then at the three-month mark, they go away unless you're playing on NX, right? I'm talking about old stuff, classic games, SNES.

When it says with new games added to the catalog 6 to 18 months after their release, implies that it is new games. Like I, I don't think that means new old games because, because that says 150 titles that are changed regularly with new games added to the catalog 6 to 18 months. But that's the, I mean, I read that. I, you get as regular meaning weekly, monthly. It'd be, it's changed out and then the new games are added way later, you know? Yeah. I, I, I mean, this is, this is, it's exciting because if it is what it sounds like it could be, then this is Nintendo. This is a truly, this is a truly radically different Nintendo.

Like my, my conjecture, although kind of radical considering Nintendo's consoles have always been kind of weak, um, compared to some of their contemporaries for the most part.

There's no way that that's just the standard that everything is going to be 60 frames per second and 900 FPS. You look at Wii U and so many games are 900 FPS now or 900, uh, P. And then there is ones that are 1080p. Some are 60, some are 30, whatever. So it's like, it's weird that they even call that out, especially when they call out video at 4K 60 FPS video streaming. Like that just means like not everything's going to be that. Yeah, it just seems like that might be the standard. I mean, that, that was the huge problem with Xbox One, which is that it was, it seemed like it was having a hard time running games at 60 frames at 1080p.

It just tells me that why, why would they say that if that wasn't going to be some sort of important? Yeah, I mean, it is weird and it's also weird that they call it gameplay graphics that run at 900p. Like it's that whole sentence to me reads is like there's something that we don't understand about that. 'Cause that's weird. There's no reason that 900p would be like, uh, well, we couldn't make a 1080, so we're just going to 900. That's what we're just going to say.

But if that's the case, then like what is the, what is the play? Um, take like, are there achievements and trophies on these games? How much does it cost? But they said there's an Achievement System that I know is endemic to Nintendo. But if they're going to put something on PS4, then their Achievement System is not going to work. And, and I'm sure I'm, and Sony's not going to like, you know, let Mario Galaxy be played and you're going to earn Nintendo achievements, but not trophies. Like that's just, they even did that to their PlayStation games to like unify everything. There's just a lot of weird questions, which is why I think that that's not what they mean. Mhm. Um, yeah, I'd love to be at Nintendo right now watching them react to these rumors. You know, the stuff leaks and it's just like, why did you put up this survey? Why would you say that?

Yeah, but I mean, if, if the other exciting thing is that if it is what they mean and they are going to have some sort of Nintendo subscription service that just plays old games on the other consoles, which I think would be shrewd. Maybe, maybe shrewd, maybe not, depending on the reality of how long people want to wait and what games are on this, on, on their subscription service. Then you have to wonder like what kind of conversations they had with the platform holders. Because if that's the case and this is just a radically different Nintendo with a radically different idea and it's a Nintendo that's swallowing its pride, which I think they should have done by just announcing that they're not doing hardware at all.
