You weren't here last week so you're totally off. Yeah, I don't even know. Anything could have changed. This show might not even be the same show anymore. I renamed it. What is it now? Kevin the Potato and his three best friends. Welcome to the first ever episode of Kevin the Potato and his three best friends. I like that. So what's the source of this Kevin potato thing? Is it the same potato thing that the internet has the potato thing? Well I started it and then they jumped on it. So I'm calling it a glob. I just started calling Kevin a potato because he kind of looks like a potato sometimes. He kind of does. Like a sexy potato. Like a fingerling potato. My God. Fingerling potatoes are the bomb. Putting that out there right now. Pretty good. Love a good fingerling potato. Ladies and gentlemen, as always, I'm Tim Gettys. I'm joined by",

Hello Kitty is my homie. So that's cool. I also got a rare shirt from them. Oh, that's what I saw you wearing that yesterday. I didn't realize that was from them.

So we'll just kind of give many reviews, cash impressions. You want to start this one off? Sure. How you doing? Good. Good. Good to see you. My name is Greg. Uh, lately I've been playing.

Um, I feel like I'm waiting for it to get amazing. You know what I mean? It's more Far Cry. It's Far Cry with a primal skin. I feel like, and I know that that sounds like a knock and I know they went out of their way in the event. We went to say, that's not what this is, but it's what it feels like. It is.

Uh, same thing with like the skills in terms of improving your character and doing this. I'm seeing it right. You know, on the thing there. But the, you know, the, the HUD, the little radar, the map, it all looks like Far Cry and it's the same idea of Far Cry and go here and take out these guys and light the bonfire to take that.

Like it's this Far Cry Primal is checking the boxes of being, I'm a video game and you have all these question marks on the map. Don't you want to go investigate them? And I'm like, I do, I do want to go investigate them and don't, I want to make the bigger quiver for my arrows. My God, I really do.

Like it is for me a hurdle that I like, I'm reading everything and not that I hate reading, but just because like I'd rather hear my character talk. I wish they would have done anything when we were, when we were at the event, I talked to you about like, are they going to transition at some point? You know how sometimes movies or cartoons or shows will do that where somebody speaking Russian and like the camera swings around and they start speaking English. So it's like, it's established, they're not speaking English, but here you go, they're speaking English so you can understand it's not doing that. So it's like, okay, cool.

It's like, all right. You know what I mean? The idea of building out the community because you have to go like there's like side missions to go help, you know, whatever wayward villagers or whatever, then you can bring them back and put them in your village and build out your village and make it bigger. That seems cool. That seems like what's going to be different compared to Far Cry for the Far Cries we know before, but not having really invested that into that yet and investigated, I should say, I don't know if that's going to be enough.

Yeah, that's me dope to get and shoot around here. But it is Far Cry. It is a video game. It is go do all these things. But even then it's like, I think I have pieces together. I think you and I were talking about, I was like, I think I beat Far Cry for, I saw both endings that I watched. Stimer beat Far Cry for. And then, so I played Far Cry for, but never finished it, but watch her beat it. And then I did the ending where you just sit there for 15 minutes in the beginning of Far Cry for that was all well and good.

But I'm going to give this more time, but I in traditional, I think Telltale fashion, I'd let this, you know, Minecraft slept on it a bit. Like, you know what I mean? I was going, I was trying to just wait for it all to be done, like to get to episode five at episode five, nowhere inside right now, they say soon. I was like, oh, whatever. I'll try it jumped in and tried that. It starts off like, who are these? What's happening? And then I really got into the characters and the play between them. You know, this is their first one where they're really using like celebrity voice actors. You know what I mean? So there's like people in there other than, I mean, Scott Porter's in it and a bunch of the other Telltale people, but Patton Oswald",

It's like this main character of the game or whatever. And so I like him. I like where the story's going. Episode one did make me want to play episode two. So I think tonight I might actually just play that instead of Far Cry. I saw that you tweeted yesterday. You're like, oh, I'm happy to see that they did the same type of intro that you're going through. What do you mean by that? Well, a Tales from the Borderlands when it started, you know, like I feel like, you know, for as much shit as Telltale gets, they do evolve their product as they go. Right.

And so what tells in the Borderlands always did is that you'd start playing the episode and then there'd be this like critical moment, like maybe 15, 30 minutes into the game or whatever where an awesome song would come in to set the mood of what the game's going to be. And then it would be like slow motion, funny, like the words and the Gearbox logos or Gearbox logos are coming in and following you like, you know, you're tumbling through the sky or doing this thing. And it was like, it was like this great breather all of a sudden after this short little appetizer introduction of like, now we're getting into like, this is what you're playing.

It was this thing in the world of what's happening in the story, and so I wasn't. I wasn't sure if they if that was something they were doing for Tales in the Borderlands or if they're going to expand it to other things and they have it in this game to go like you started off and like yeah, you know you're this in episode one, you know, tumbling through the air. This is coming in creepers or their spiders are there and it's fun stuff so the Layers appear. Well, I'm not done with story mode.

I'm even more, but in the beginning for sure when I was playing like you know they're in the Minecraft world or whatever and they're. They were going to a build competition and stuff and I was like I should probably start Minecraft on PlayStation four because I'm playing on Vita forever and that's fine, but like it's limited. You know what I mean? I think that's hampered my excitement to go back to it just because it's a smaller world where PlayStation four worlds are crazier and better builds and you know caverns better minds.

It was fun because we were all being goons to each other and stupid, but it was like a relay thing and Colin went first. So when I went in there and sat down to play Layers of Fear, no idea what the fuck's happening. You know what I mean? Like I'm playing it and it's just like, all right, collect this, do that. This guy's talking is is is this a random do? I don't know. You know what I mean? And then when I got my code and sat down to actually play it, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it and how actually interesting the story is.

Where like even tonight, like I'd like to play something that has an end. So I'm done with it and I feel like I've completed a chapter and I put it away. Like Layers of Fear, you know, six chapters, you can beat it in a night. I think I spaced out over two just because I started late. But it's the same thing of like I go through, I explore and I, you know, it's conquerable. And then when it's done, I feel like I've accomplished something.

It runs like shit on PlayStation 4. It is, it has scares. You know what I mean? When I was playing it, for me, it is like that. All right. Like, BT didn't happen, but this is like similar to it. And it's going to give you the same kind of spooks and scares and stuff. I'm like, oh, okay, cool. You know what I mean? And when I dug about it, you know, as I'm playing it, it occurred to me that like, this is my preferred haunted house. Like, you know what I mean? Like on Halloween, when you go to the haunted house and the guys in the mask jump out and stuff, it's like that thing I'm like, oh, that was funny, huh? But like, it wasn't great.

I'm like, I got to turn back around and the world's going to be completely different now and something you're trying to get. So you still get scared because you don't know what's going to be there because in the video game world, literally anything can happen. Whereas in the haunted house, it's just some fucking broke ass college kid with a mask. I did not enjoy it nearly as much as it sounds like you guys did. You played the whole night? I didn't beat the whole thing, but I don't, I don't even want to. I got, I played, I played most of it. I think most of it. Yeah. And it just, I don't know.

This to me kind of just felt like it was trying to just get all the big scare moments out and it's like, I, it felt like a kind of just adding all the different things that we've seen from the horror games over the last couple of years into one just thing. Just like, here's this moment, here's this moment. And it like almost becomes predictable of where the scares are going to be. Of course. Yeah. And I think the greatest offense though is that the game while it was designed, it's kind of like, you know, let you explore these areas and feel like you're, you know, getting the story and all this from the atmosphere and the environment.

Like, I feel like there was multiple times where I'm there and I know when I turn around some reason to be there, but I turn around and I wasn't exactly facing where the scare happened. Sure. You know, or even in Colin's let's play, there's a scene where you're walking down the hallway and things like the painting start like coming off and there's something, there's something a little bit off about it that I was like, that could have been scary.

I was playing it through all one night and I got distracted during the last chapter by a phone call so I never went back to it. But I will I mean I just have to finish the last chapter. But so unless it falls off the cliff I don't know that it's going to be any worse than what I think it is. But I do enjoy the rifling through shit and like being rewarded for finding letters and newspaper clippings and stuff like that.

And I don't want to spoil too much of it, but like you don't you could really go through the game without knowing any of the context at all. Because you're just not if you're not thorough, it reminds me of Gone Home in the sense that it's not nearly as good as Gone Home, but it reminds me of Gone Home in the sense that the more you engage with the world around you, the more you get out of it. It's the exact opposite way I felt about Firewatch where it was Firewatch was just whatever like it. The story was kind of boring to me. It didn't really matter what was going on in the game.

You can play on PC as well I think. I've been spending quite a bit of time with that.

I mean when it makes you wonder what they were doing like for a long time and I'm sure that there's a lot of character balance and the roster is quite expansive and there's some new characters and they have to get all that stuff right.
