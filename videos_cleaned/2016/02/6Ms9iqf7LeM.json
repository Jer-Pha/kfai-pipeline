Yes, a couple days ago Taco Bell comes out of nowhere on the social medias, on the Twitters, as they normally do, blowing our minds. They come out and they're like, \"Hey, we're going to unveil the biggest thing ever. Do you want to pre-order it?\" And I'm like, \"Oh, Taco Bell, I love you. I do want to pre-order. Yes, I want to pre-order it.\" So I pre-ordered five and that's how that thing works. My favorite thing was that this this this uh process was so well planned that when we walked into the Taco Bells, the person that was serving us had no idea what we were talking about. No idea at all. Now here's the thing, Nick, here's here's the thing that's even deeper than this. It was an online pre-order. You have to make your account. It's for the online ordering. Now there's no Taco Bell in San Francisco that does online ordering, so that was my issue where I'm like, well, I guess we can't officially do this. So going in, I",

So going in, I wasn't sure they were going to have it. I actually thought they weren't. Then we go up, we ask the young woman, we're like, \"Hey, do you have the pre-order thing?\" She's confused. She has no idea what's going on. And I'm like, uh, and then at some point she go, \"Do you want me to ask my manager?\" Very helpful. She said, \"I can go grab a manager.\" And Tim's like, \"Yes, please grab manager.\" And the manager knew exactly. The manager comes back, he like, \"Oh, you want you got this? Yeah, no, no, we're doing this. We're doing this.\" And I'm super excited about it. Got that. Then I got even more excited because like you have to buy a drink. I'm like, all right, whatever, I don't care. Bought the drink. Now granted, they're a Pepsi Place. I couldn't go down that road, so I got water. Water kick anyway. Um, now the biggest deal though, Nick, is that",

Um, now the biggest deal though, Nick, is that they were like, \"The rest of it's free.\" Yeah, you get these free today only. Oh, hid get for free. And you guessed what it was. Here's the big deal before there's a lot of buildup. I want you to know the Quesalupa. We got the Quesalupa in this bag right now. What is that? It's half quesadilla, half chalupa. Something I've only dreamed about, right? For years, since I was probably 10 years old, I've dreamed of this. And it now exists. It's been in testing for about a year at this point. There's been rumors that this would happen and it finally did. I like that it has to be in testing like it's a like it's some sort of brand new invention that's going to rock every holy ****. It comes in gold. It is amazing. Oh my God, I'm already sold. Already sold. So let's just get right into it. The smell. Let's let's do the package.",

Let's let's do the package. Smell it. It smells like a chalupa. I can confirm. Yeah, okay. Oh my God, yeah. Oh man, look at that. Put this over. It's the new Quesalupa. They know exactly what they're doing here. So all it is is a chalupa that's fried, right? God bless. Took him a little while. The process isn't ironed out, by the way. It took him a little a second. I I I looked back on the line and I was like, no one's making our food. And the guy's like, \"Sir, it takes a little while. We have to fry them in the back, so you're going to have to be patient.\" And I was like, all right. Um, and we were patient. Let's see if it was worthwhile. Let's try this. Little known fact, Greg Miller loves Taco Bell. Can't get enough of it. My God. Oh, daddy long legs, go home. Make a little scoot out for you. I love chalupas. Push that but for you. How you do it.

No, see, it tastes like a cheesier chalupa. Yeah, I was never a huge chalupa fan because I always felt like I was wasting space in my stomach with the fluff of the chalupa shell. So good. But I'm actually pretty into this. I'm not I'm not going to lie, this is pretty good because it's like it's kind of like a um it's kind of like what what do they call those, Greg? What are the pizzas that's not a pizza if they fold it over? Calzone. A calzone. It's like a it's almost like a calzone calzone. This is really good. I will say I prefer it to a chalupa already. It's very hot, so you'll be happy to know that the U thickness of the shell really sucks that heat in. Uh, it's got the distinctive",

Uh, it's got the distinctive Taco Bell taste. It tastes like Taco Bell of the ground beef, of the sort of the spicy sauce and the cheese and the lettuce. Now what I like about the cheese though is the chalupa normally has just the the normal cheese like the cheese just put on it, but now it's like melted a nacho cheese. Is that is that what it is? Well, I think it's just the cheese melted because it was oh, because it was so hot. Yeah, that makes sense. No, the whole thing's not fried. The shell is fried. Everything inside is just your normal Taco Bell ingredients. Man, I'm really happy. I got to say shout out to the value on this. Now we got it free, so obviously that's super value value, but they're cheap. They're really cheap. It's like $1.99 for this. Yeah, not bad. I that's it's it's a hearty meal too. Yeah, you could probably sustain",

Yeah, you could probably sustain yourself pretty long about about halfway through a day with just one of these bad boys. You're not going to have Colin Moriarty's abs with it, but you know, it's still it's going to be hearty. Come show the boys your abs, Colin. We got you this, Colin. We got a third one just for you. Don't tell Greg. What is this? This is the Quesalupa. It's half quesadilla, half chalupa, right? It's like a quesadilla shell fried like a chalupa. I don't really know. No, I don't really know the differences between. No, you're done. You don't want it. It's got the golden ticket wrapper though. I'm going to eat that one too. All right, Tim's going to eat this one. Who's the scop? I love. Yeah, I love the gold. This is like it's beautiful. That's some **** baller ****. It really makes you think that you're getting a value out of it and are when in",

Well, there you have it. I agree. I agree. I like when they add the vast catalog of Taco Bell menu. It just needs to stay. Thank you so much, Taco Bell. Please follow me on Twitter. Please, I beg you. Please follow Tim on Twitter. Don't follow me. My favorite thing think about again, I always talk about Taco Bell's Twitter being the biggest deal in the world and how awesome they are. Greg originally tweeted at me talking about this thing when I pre-ordered it. Also got Dan Ryckert involved. Also got Andrew Reiner involved. A bunch of different people, right? We had a whole conversation. Taco Bell just simply responds, \"I'll see you boys Saturday.\" I love you, Taco Bell. We love you, Taco Bell.",
