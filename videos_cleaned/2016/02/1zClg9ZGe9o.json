I'm currently the reigning Kinda Funny Nintendo World Champion. Now, as you may... Thank you. You can't know. That's for... That's a flag on the play for what did I do? You just **** shoot your mouth off. That's Nick Scarpino. He's the referee today in this contest. And the number one contender is the one and only Pure One Tim Gettys. Yes, Nacho Idol will be mine. It's never been yours before. I'm undefeated. I've had the title for months now. Remember, I won it. Yeah, that's debatable. No, there's no debate. I know I've had the belt for another video up right now on YouTube.com/KindaFunny. As you know, when we started the Kinda Funny Nintendo World Championship, we said it would be defended every Saturday. We're defending it here, one of our live streams we're doing to support Patreon.com/KindaFunny. But I didn't want to just come out here and put my title on the line. It's",

Yeah, so I can't challenge you to Fire in the Sky, which is we're gonna play Mario Kart. A Fire in the Sky match. We're gonna play Mario Kart 200cc. My God, the chat over on our Twitch page, Twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames, picked that we're gonna play the Egg Cup. Egg Cup. Okay, 200cc. But what has gonna happen is I give my belt to the referee to put on the line. It's officially off of me. While you can put it there, I guess, like you want to be always putting on what up right now. You do whatever you want to the thing we need to do though is that we we're going to go through. We've selected our carts. We're here at the Egg Cup.

You can only drink the milk either at the end once the race is competitive, all four. We're doing the entire Cup. Okay, the entire Cup. I can't drink that belt. No, not the end of... You can drink the milk whenever you want to, but by drinking the milk, you forfeit. And I know the same thing to bike. Oh my God, my God. It's like an I Quit Match here, a four Iron Man. So it started. I match. That's the equivalent of tapping out. Exactly. You can tap out whenever you want, but you forfeit. Oh no. Nick is the ref. He'll call the balls.
