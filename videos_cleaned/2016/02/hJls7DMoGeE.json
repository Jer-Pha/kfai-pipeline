Simpson innocent found innocent but everyone still believes he's guilty and all these different things right and I remember this interview O.J. and did I want to stay on 0 0 but it was I forget what it was and it's after the fact and I remember he was walking talking to some reporter right and this woman came up to him was like I just always wanted to shake your hand I was wondering if I could shake your hand he's like sure of course and he shakes her hand and she just goes thanks I've always wanted to shake the hand of a murderer and walked away and like and like O.J.
