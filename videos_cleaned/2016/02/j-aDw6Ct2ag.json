This is the thing, Game Trailers closes up shop after 13 years doing it and I want to talk about it and basically the state of video game media, video game enthusiast press, however you want to do it, 'cause I hate to say it, but it doesn't surprise me that Game Trailers went away. It surprises me that it was out of the blue, nobody saw it coming. It's, I thought it was crazy that, you know, it was uh, you get four hours of no notice before everybody else. That's like, I think what Brandon tweeted about and talked about on the NeoGAF Forum, right? As the fact that they came into work on Monday and found out that day, it's over. And you know, you then they told people four hours later or whatever. But I think it goes back to the same thing we've talked about before and I know it's an analogy and you know, a metaphor I guess I beat into the ground all the time is how for the longest time",

Where there was Indies, there was this mid-tier THQ stuff and then there was Triple-A and then the mid-tier fell out and all we're left with now is Indies in Triple-A, right? And I think that's what we're seeing happen with games press, games personality, right? Where there's the independent circuit that's us, Jim Sterling, these people who branch off YouTube channels in general that go off and do their own thing, have their own independent audience, maybe aren't the biggest audience in the world, but are able to support the people they love. Then you have mid-tier sites, which is where I would have put Game Trailers, and then you have your IGN and GameSpot, these pillars, right?

What's what happened, right? Is like Game Trailers closes up, they do a final Twitch live stream. I went and watched and every comment in there is, 'Go do a Patreon, keep doing this, I'll support you,' da da da, right? And it's just similar to us, different circumstance obviously, but like we come with our own fan, our own fans, our own group behind us that like there are people who want to see Brandon and Kyle and all the guys over there keep doing their own content, but is that, am I wrong, Colin, is the is the mid-tier falling away?

Like I just think that because the the the the way you do business on the Internet is just it's just changing, yeah. Um, you know, Jim Sterling wrote a really thought-provoking piece on Jimquisition about it. Not that I didn't agree with all of it, but it was an interesting piece about the changing economics and and uh, the changing way that content is paid for and the changing way that content creators are treated.

So you have to find um, other ways to pay for and there's only so many ways to pay. Like you can either do what Giant Bomb does, which is like, you know, have subscription model with a pretty large group of people compared to our our audience and then, you know, some free content as well, but they're definitely user support. They're a hybrid of user support and like kind of more traditional means. You can have like the GameSpot and uh, the Eurogamer and the Jans and whatever that that um, are uh, amalgamation and of of traditional ad revenue and pre-roll and um, 30-second ads before your videos and sponsored content and stuff like that.

I like being transparent with the audience and I think they already know this. It's certainly not even remotely all of our all the money we make. So um, because we it cost money to run this company, it's we wouldn't really be able to actually do what we do with just the Patreon money, but it's certainly very important.

Like I think that ultimately people are retreating to different venues to find people that they really trust in smaller groups of of of comm in smaller communities that resonate with them more and there and we have the evidence, the proof's in the pudding. Like there are thousands and thousands of people that will pay us five or $10 a month because they can get a review for free from VG247, but they really would rather hear from us and so they're like, 'Well, we'll just give you five or $10 a month to make sure you guys can do this,' because it's just a drop in the bucket for me.

So I think that the whole landscape is is really radically changing. My whole thing is I think the pillars, I'm talking about your IGN, your GameSpot, maybe one other big .com, which I can't even name, which what it would be. I think they're there. I don't think they're there in terms of maybe the scale and scope, you know what I mean? I think layoffs will come for those people. I think their staffs will be reduced. I think they'll do more user-generated content, but I I still think that it's always going to be, 'I oh, this new game's come out, so I'm going to go to the two sites I always go to see the general review, the mainstream review,' right? I will read that and then I will go, 'Awesome, it's a DC game, so I want to know what Greg thinks. It's a, you know, PlayStation'",

Like you're going to have this mainstream base level review of what it is, but then you want to drill down to who the experts are. And the same reason you come to me for a Batman Superman review, but not ne not what I think of Civil War trailer, right? Well, I think that we I think the, you know, we saw this play out with um, uh, you know, Jim Jim wrote a little bit about this. How much water are you going to drink? This is like your 17th cup of water on there. God forbid I'm hydrated, Colin. It's good for your colon. Thank you. But I don't have colon problems, do I, Colin?

The Jim Sterling wrote about about this a little bit that like what happens, I mean, he didn't write this specifically, but it's like what happens when the people that you trust at these outlets are transient? Like, sure. Do you know, we saw this play out with PS I Love You, where like our podcast became number one before we even put an episode up because people liked what we did with our old show.

It's just like it's just to say like when we said we were going to do a show like that, it didn't matter where we were, people came to the show. And and Jim learned that when he left The Escapist and when he left Destructoid and is thriving. Um, and others are going to learn it in my suspicion with the Game Trailers guys, a few of them anyway. I don't I I'm I'm speaking all candor that I've never used Game Trailers. I don't know those guys. I don't use their content. So I'm not speaking from a user standpoint. I'm just speaking from I know these people's names because people talk about how much they love them.

Like, you know, there are people working at all of the outlets that I I read or whatever where I I wonder if they understand that they could break off and do it by themselves. Um, and that people would follow them and it might not be easy and success might not be guaranteed. Like I we often talk about like the the the **** fear and the A&A that I had in the months leading up to us leaving. It was like it was like, 'Man, they, you know, they really **** up,' or, 'They don't,' you know, like, 'No, we didn't.' Like we are more financially secure than we used to be. We are happier than we used to be. We are we have control over what we do and we have a small, a much smaller audience that is much more dedicated to what to us and what we do and I",

But that's that goes back to what we were talking about with the guys from Campo Santo, which is like, you know, we would also not be in this position without having learned from those OGs from th from those big outlets or in those in their guys' case from Telltale, in our case from IGN. Like we just would not be in this position to have known what the **** to even do without that experience.

I don't like I do that don't because like dude, the Best Friends, well, they're they're not going to be and that's the thing is like and that's and that's like when you cross like when you cross like the paradigm and and and things get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and then I think you lose control. Like I don't it's not say I don't want the company to grow or become more lucrative or whatever or be better. Like of course I do.

They were they were this weird business that was doing really really well, but they didn't write anything. It was all video. And I was like, 'All video, that's never going to work.' And then it started working really really well. And then they got off track once YouTube hit and once and I remember that time when we were having those discussions at IGN of like, 'Should we reposting things to YouTube because there's a big audience there, but are we going to cannibalize our own traffic?'

I guess I I guess that's part of the problem that they had was they weren't able to actually use the tools that are out there and evolve quickly. And that's when you know, when we always talk about not wanting to go back to the IGN model, it's not so much that I wouldn't want to go back and work with some of the people over there or like in general, they're great. It's just right now we're a company of six people and we can do we can are we really? He's counting James. Oh, okay. Oh, sorry. Well, I count Kevin as two people. Sorry.

The Giant Bomb, we do utilize that system. We do have like Patreon for all intents and purposes is just a subscription model. People can pay for the content they want. And in my opinion, that is the single like like awesomest thing that any content creator has at their disposal at this point, right? The Game Trailers guys are smart.

I remember the days when people would we got bought twice when I was there and I saw people a lot of people get hired and I saw two gigantic rounds of layoffs where I walked in and like half of my friends suddenly didn't work there anymore.
