Not not excited, especially especially it's not it's not the 20th anniversary one. It was relevant to us either because when I when I first saw that I was like, yeah, it's not been 20 years really, you know, not for us, not yeah, for Green and Japan Pok\u00e9mon Green and stuff like that. Yeah, whatever though. I mean, so '98 was is like the real birth of it to me at least. Um, but you **** it, I'll celebrate 20 years. It's it's funny. I recorded a video yesterday where I was talking about my Pok\u00e9mon memories, which you should too, using #Pok\u00e9mon20. And uh, I was talking about it. I was like, yeah, it's crazy. It's been in my life in 20 years. Then I was I'm 16 now. I was six. I was like, that's not right. Wait a second. When did you first hear about Pok\u00e9mon? Then I was eight. Okay, yeah, '98 is when I came out here. The Pok\u00e9mon is um, was awesome. I have I have a lot of memories of",

Uh, '98, '99 Game Boy Pocket um, and uh, remember sitting with my friend Cody, who's a buddy of mine from Long Island, and we had the Link Cable and we used to just play all the time. I used to **** hammer them. I remember I used to just like destroy him. You suck, Cody. Um, but we used to just sit at his kitchen table like all day and just grind and play and order food and go to the supermarket and just get food and go through our bad batteries that we would go through constantly because you know, of course, for all the young listeners out there, we didn't have to rechargeable batteries on those on.

So um, and I had Ruby. Mhm. And uh, so Pok\u00e9mon is important like Final Fantasy VII is important and that it introduced a lot of people to uh, role-playing games. But unlike Final Fantasy VII, it's really like baby's first role-playing game. And I don't mean that in a disrespectful way. It's a it's a much more accessible way to enter into the world of statistical video games um, than Final Fantasy VII was, even though Final Fantasy VII is very stripped down compared to VI and V and IV. Um, so Pok\u00e9mon is really important. Pok\u00e9mon's up there with Doom and and Mario and you know, whatever, in terms of like the pantheon of like very influential and very important games.

There's only been one generation after that. Yeah, okay. So that's the last one I played. And it because it's just it it literally is the same thing over and over again. It's it's not there's literally nothing. F I'm totally wrong. What am I talking about? There was Black and White after that and then X and Y. Black and Black and Y. And then I didn't play though. So Diamond one's the last one I played, um, which was I think 2009 or so, probably 2010. You miss out because they the new everyone since then did at least shift into more of a 3D. It's still the same thing. It's the same game. Like, and I don't know what you're supposed to do like to make it different. That's why it's not my series.",

But I think that I'm in the minority and I also think that a lot of people that like Pok\u00e9mon now didn't play it in 1998 or 1999 or 2000 or 2001. So they'll come around and be tired of it just like I was by 2010 as well, I think. And there's going to be another group of people playing it for the first time. And I think that's kind of the weird secret of Pok\u00e9mon. Because I mean, obviously, I'm such a huge fan of the the whole franchise. But I am very much a fan of the older ones. And like, I'm not a purist in the sense of like, I won't even play the new ones. But it's like they don't have that same magic and it is just the same thing.

But it's I would love to see them actually make any make some huge changes. But at the same time, people are scared to change. And that's what the spin-offs are for. And I think Pok\u00e9mon has had so many spin-offs that have had some great games. Pok\u00e9mon Snap, yeah. And oh, definitely. Where is another Snap? All these other things. They're just they're great. And nothing touches the core games though. And I think that we've had a couple console RPG Pok\u00e9mon games. But they were never quite the same thing. It's not what we wanted. But that's the example of them doing something different. So like Pok\u00e9mon uh, Colosseum and Pok\u00e9mon XD: Gale of Darkness or whatever, the GameCube games.

Then again, I'm not a game creator either. So I don't know what I want. But they can just keep doing this forever. It's it's funny to me that what I want the most is just another remake of Red and Blue. Like I want that on a console and just just do it. Just go all out. But it's like, why do I want that? Yeah, it's also easy for me to say that I want them to change it for something I'm not super um, invested in anymore. Because when they changed Dragon Quest, for instance, um, with X, I was furious. So it's so it's it and all of us were. Um, so and and Dragon Quest is a series similar to Pok\u00e9mon that's changed very little um, because I don't feel like it needs to.",

So it it is easy for me to it is easy for me to like sit here and be like, well, Pok\u00e9mon needs to change. But I just don't think it's it's deep enough for it to not change. It's it's it's um, it is a very rudimentary RPG. It is like one of the simplest RPGs there is. It's just really fun. The hook of collecting things reaches so deep into our psyche as gamers, I think. Because we like to collect things. I think as gamers, we like collectibles. We like Intel. We like, yeah, we like to just find things and and we like to collect games and put them on our shelves. And we like collectible card games and we like **** all these things. And I think that just it just it just resonated with us.

And I think it was so Pok\u00e9mon's so much more than just a video game to me because as soon as it came out, there was a cartoon and then there was a card game. Like all within a matter matter of a year. Like it all happens so fast. And then all a sudden there's spin-offs and there's this and that. There's Pok\u00e9mon Pinball and there's like all these things that you're like, it's just consuming your life. And there's movies and stuff. And uh, for me, Pok\u00e9mon was so integral in my friendships and just meeting people and what all of my relationships with people in my class meant. It's like I had one friend that I watched the show with. And I remember when the movie came out, we went to go see it. And like we lost our **** minds seeing new",

Like this is nuts. Like this is **** nuts. I can't handle this. And it's like those moments happen so much. They happened every week when I'd go and buy a **** booster pack and open it up and see which card I got. And like my friend got the **** holographic Mewtwo. And I'm stuck with the Pok\u00e9mon Breeder as my rare card. And I'm like, ah, God damn it. But then the next week I get Blastoise. And like they figured out to make this crack for kids to get money out of every single way that they could, whether it's the the movies or buying the TV shows VHSes or buying the comics or buying the cards or buying the games or buying the strategy guides.

And it's like, well, if you play the game, you're going to like the show. Because if you like the show, you're going to play the game. And if you play, you know what I mean? All just it's a cycle. And the show just keeps going. Ash is still 10 years old in the the goddamn show. But he's done so much. And all it is is the same thing over and over and over. But it's new kids watching it. And it's a whole new group of uh, Pok\u00e9mon. And ****, I am most impressed by the fact that it's been going on this long. And we look at it and we're like, ah, it's the same thing over and over.

I don't even I'm not even talking about a big shift. Like maybe I'll wait till the next just gen comes out and then I'll get back into it. Um, but Pok\u00e9mon's 20th anniversary. They're going all out without actually announcing anything big. And I think it's because of the NX. They're in that weird holding period. But I am very impressed with how they're handling the anniversary because a lot of anniversaries are like, all right, hey, it's the year Luigi or whatever, you know.

Oh, hell yes, I am. They're updating that uh, so that you don't need Link Cable and you can uh, just do wirelessly. Do it wirelessly over Wi-Fi, which crazy. You can can battle over Wi-Fi. Like, what the ****? That's I didn't realize they're adding that until I was like, look, researching last night. Like, they're adding online multiplayer to a freaking Game Boy ROM. I'm impressed with that. That's really **** cool. And then in Japan, they're doing the same thing. But they're also releasing Green Version because Green came out in Japan, never came out here.

And there's one that comes with the original art from Red and Blue's box, which looks **** cool. Japan has four different DS that are colored based on the the Red, Yellow, Blue, Green.

Um, in **** nerdy news for me, Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie, Pok\u00e9mon: The Power of One, and Pok\u00e9mon 3: The Movie \u2013 Spell of the Unown, the three movies, the first three movies are being released on Blu-ray in a special ass steel book.

Um, they're releasing those just digitally in HD. Um, they're doing a whole new Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game like expansion called Generations that focuses on more the old school ones that we grew up with. There's also a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Collection. So it's all the the fancy ones like Mew and Celebi and all that ****.

And then there was that Super Bowl commercial, which do you guys see it? No, watch. I was waiting for the Super Bowl. They're going to do an edited version on the Super Bowl. Like I think the one on the line now is like a minute long. The other one's probably just going to be like 15 or 30. Okay. It was awesome. Like Kevin saw it. You like it, Kevin? Yep.

It's some guy playing football. And it's very subtly Pok\u00e9mon. Like very subtly. Like if you look in the background, things cut out. The me watching it.

Game Boy was was old by the time but by the time it came out. And no one was playing like, holy, no one was playing. But the Game Boy was in a lull at that point. Pretty significant low. Um, and Pok\u00e9mon like by the time we got Pok\u00e9mon, Game Boy was nine years old. Yeah. And it's pretty significant that its biggest game came out that late in it cycle and let it live and gave us the Pocket and the Color and all this kind of stuff to kind of like, I got a Game Boy.

So it is based on when it originally came out. I totally respect that. Understand that. But it just it'll resonate with me more in uh, 1998. Yeah, when I'll feel really **** old as well. They're celebrating throughout the year and they things planned throughout the year. So I don't think it's too late for them to announce something later like at E3 like for the NX or whatever.

Then he just, I can do that. And he just runs up mountain. I don't know what the hell's going on. No, man. I I like it a lot. I just think it was a different direction.

Like on the 20th anniversary trailer they put out, it did say Pok\u00e9mon Go 2016. So that's really exciting to me. Uh, Pok\u00e9mon Picross came out last month and people seem to enjoy it. I was never a Picross guy, so I didn't play it. And then the most important, Great Detective Pikachu: The Birth of a New Duo comes next week to Japan. No news of a US release. But we can only hope because that **** looks awesome. He's name the guy's his partner's name part. Name, Tim. The new duo. It's Tim and Detective Pikachu. What the **** is that game, Colin? I don't know. And I don't really care either. When the second I saw that image of Pikachu wearing his little Sherlock hat, I'm like, I can't. That looks",

He has a deep voice. He speaks Japanese. Like he's speaking. And then he walks him to another Pikachu. And the other Pikachu pika. He's **** talking. It's great. It's **** great. I can't. Oh, I can. I can't hard. Anyways, I'm really excited. I love Pok\u00e9mon. I hope glad you. I'm very excited for the re-releases of um, of Pok\u00e9mon come in to Virtual Console. Like like I never thought that would happen. Cause Nintendo is so like that's one of their Disney Vault things. Just like Pok\u00e9mon is very generational. And like they stick to it. But they're doing it. They're finally doing it. Hopefully this means we'll get Gold and Silver and Crystal, my favorite ones. But it's going to be nice replaying the original Pok\u00e9mon game. I haven't done that",

But now they're updating. ****. I don't know if MissingNo's gone. I'm **** out. Tell me, brother.",
