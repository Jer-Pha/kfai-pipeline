Now do it here, move this, show them what you showed me out of the kitchen table. Oh, look at that. That's a real muscle. That's a real muscle that's turning in case you were wondering something. I got a lot of body fat. That's the issue I'm working on now. I think it's gonna play well into a couple of the conversations we're gonna have today. Okay, some of the topics, sure, namely taxes. Okay, a lot of body fats, it makes the muscle look a little bit bigger. It's nice. It's not, I don't blame you next to a real muscle. You did it and it did like the Schwarzenegger thing where it like became a lump, like you know what I mean? Just like something that maybe I scoop ice cream on. You can almost hear the noise.

I was living I was living down the hallway from I was a city away and I heard him. The very first one was it was filled with so much anger toward the American government.

So you not to worry about anything. If we just had that and that's all we had to worry about, would you would get to the end of the year and depending on how many deductions you claim, you would either owe a little bit of money or they owe you a little more. It's a wash, right? But because our lives are ridiculous and people will just come out of the woodwork or like, hey, come down to LA and be in a VO for a couple hours and pretend like you're working hard. I'll go down there, work hard, but I'm just, you know, they're gonna give you a 1099. And what that means is that's that's miscellaneous income outside of what you made in the company.

But if you went down there for instance, and the company said we're not setting you down there, this is your freelance gig and you had to book a flight out of your own. Well, that's $ 00 then is money that you had to put toward getting that job. So theoretically, an obvious consultant accountant, he'll tell you whether or not this is this is true or not. Or she or she will. Our accountant just happens to be male. Actually, there's male and a female. So both. But we work work. Tone Deaf, sorry. Yeah, Tone Deaf actually is our accountant, which is crazy because when he's not making ill beats, ****, he's certified public accountant. So that's why you're able to do it.

Because I remember my time. Who knows? Yeah, who really knows? 500 and they have to give you a 1099. Okay, so if you if you if like for instance, we have some people who have done some work for us that I've 1099, but they've only paid him a couple hundred bucks. We don't claim that. That just gets cleaned under a different category. So they don't have to worry about paying taxes on anything under than five hundred dollars. So let's say let's say that I just had this normal **** and I had one thing that was five hundred and one dollars or whatever, just right above the that number is right.

Hundred feet. I thought you were talking about write-off because your minimum deduction is sixty three hundred dollars. I think so. Like if your deductions all don't reach sixty three hundred dollars, it doesn't matter that you did your deductions because they're not allowed to do I can take them anyway, right? So like I think that's the some people should look it up if they know they will take tax so much for me. But I think that's what it is.

Like it is an unfathomable amount of money that I owe. But to be fair, that's because we chose as a business to keep that money there so that we could do things like pay Kevin, buy equipment, things like that. So if at the end of the year we decided, hey, **** it, we don't wanna run this anymore.

I'm not even complaining about any of that. I'm complaining about the federal government.

And the goal is to eventually have some write-offs and make a little bit more money and maybe, you know, skip back on some stuff. Like maybe I don't need to go to Starbucks five times a day. You know what she doesn't know? Can't hurt me. All right. No, you bought coffee pods. Don't don't be. I didn't have coffee pods. Okay, still it kept him from literally bought them at Starbucks.

I'm trying to switch to decaf as well because my overall anxiety level has risen in the last two months and I read that caffeine does not help that exacerbates that. So so with this write-off stuff, another thing that I'm not clear on. If I were to have bought a car last year like I did, hmm, does that do anything? Cause I was you people, oh, you buy a new car, you get write-offs and ****. Not affect me. What about a badass Prius C? You did it. You should be able to write that off as your as a green vehicle.

We should we should slash the share of the military and everything else in the federal government does. But it's so mandatory spending and then we have mandatory spending and the discretionary spending. And by the way, about fifteen percent of the money we spend is just servicing the debt, which we'll get into in a minute.

So they just borrow it and print it and then they just keep the cycle going on. The government owes what is it? Something like five and a half times more money in debt than it collects per year. That's the equivalent of someone who makes $50,000 a year owing like almost $300,000 in debt. But still just be like, yeah, I'm good. Yeah, we just we keep rolling. But I owe five times more money than I make. I'm sad or just insane. It's not a mortgage or some safe and but they were like, is everyone what about your mortgage? It's like that's an investment.
