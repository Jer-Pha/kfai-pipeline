I am up for Most Entertaining Online Personality at the South by Southwest Gaming Awards, and it would mean the world to me if you went and voted for me. Of course, every time we win one of these things, we win for Kinda Funny, and it's a win for you because we get to go there and be like, \"Hey, people who've never heard of us, guess what? People like us!\" And they go, \"Who are you?\" And they go, \"Maybe I want to be a best friend,\" or they're jerks and they say, \"We'll stay away forever.\" So if you go to KindaFunny.com/SXSW and vote Greg Miller for Most Entertaining Online Personality, I would take it as a personal favor that I will never, ever be able to repay you for. What's up, guys? Welcome to the first ever Episode 56 of the Kinda Funny Gamescast. As always, I'm Tim Gettys, joined by the coolest dude to video games, Colin Moriarty and Greg Miller.

If you believe that, well, you would already know that you went over to Patreon.com/KindaFunny. You gave us a dollar to get this thing early, or you can once YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames and got it free on combo. There's Kinda Funny Games. I mess up, Timmy, on this map. It's been a long month of promoting the animated series. Lee, where I understand it's hard to switch gears. One day, one day I'll get that stuff. Anyway, there's a weekly show where we talk about video games and stuff that we like. We're gonna start this one off right. I want to talk about you, Mega Ran.

So we're gonna go from birth to like NASA now. Alright. Well, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, West Philadelphia, born and raised. Yes, in front of the TVs where I spent most of my days. Um, so basically, just, you know, growing up a fan of video games for a long, long time and a fan of hip-hop at the same time, and just watching both of them rise around the same time, and me just really wanting to get caught up in that, that, uh, you know, both those cultures. And I started writing music, I guess, as a teenager, and it took me maybe ten years of writing music until I figured, let me try to inject some of those games that I love into the music. And I made this album called Mega Ran in 9, and we talked about Mega Man a little bit on it. And I think Capcom heard it and immediately shut you down. And there are no circumstance. They embarrassed me. No, no, they were okay.",

They embarrassed me. No, no, they were okay with it, and they decided to let me keep making music, and they, you know, encouraged me to make more Mega Man tunes. And so I did that. Then I went to other, you know, franchises that I really loved: Final Fantasy, all kinds of stuff, River City Ransom, mostly retro things. So I think I've then fallen into a bit of a, I guess, a niche or subgenre called nerdcore, also another called chiptune. So I put those together, and what I call it is chip-hop. It's a little bit of both, you know, chiptune hip-hop, hip-hop. That's my thing. Yeah. So now, right now, let's see, I am in San Francisco on a tour with my good friend Richie Branson, game developer and amazing rapper. He and I work on projects together.

So what does a tour look like then? Like, what does it look like, this current tour? I mean, it's been just, you know, into a city for a day, usually, you know, playing a show, getting to maybe eat some food and shake hands with people that are in the town, and then we play a great show, and usually we have to go to the next city. Fortunately, the the Bay Area shows are kind of close together, and we get to kind of hang out in one general area. And so, yeah, we'll be in San Francisco, we'll be in San Jose, we'll be in Sacramento. And yeah, it's usually playing a show, eating some something terrible late at night, and then heading back home and getting a little bit of rest, and then getting up, getting on the internet, handling all of our, you know.",

That's the thing. You don't want these clerical duties and these emails you have to do. I would assume you have thousands of people who do these things for you. You're a big-time rapper traveling. So for like a tour, how is that all on you? Are you negotiating spots and figuring out like where you're going? Oh, yeah. I mean, the hell do you do that? You save money if you do it yourself, you know? You don't have to pay anybody. So as long as I can do it at a pretty good high level, I think I've continued to do it. So I tour manage, I booked the dates, I, you know, I organized the rental vehicle and how we're going to get there, organized where we're gonna sleep.

However, at the end, they're standing there with the handout like, \"Alright, I made that happen for you. Now compensate me.\" And it's like, I think I can do that. So I try it, and it usually works out well. Nicely. You you there, you've been doing it for ten years, right? That you've been out there doing all this stuff, shaking it. So what I think you glossed over that I loved about your story, right, is that you were a teacher, right? Oh, yes. I didn't even say that. I've been making music now. I'll put video games in it.

Started off as a substitute, you know, and then dealing with middle school kids who, you know, are 12 going on 30. I think they know everything. Is I think it, um, it helped me a lot with my performances because it's you got to be able to improvise, you got to be able to change on the fly, and ultimately stand on a stage and stand in front of 30 kids is the same because you have to make them believe in you and what you're doing. And if and if the kids don't believe in you, they see right through you, and it's over. You know, you lose them and you never get them back. So so I was I was kind of a mean teacher, though.

And you've been a big supporter of Kinda Funny, all things. We are always so soft-spoken, so easygoing, so down to help us out and do something. I can tie these kids. Whatever they would erect you. Yeah, they would have. You can't. You absolutely have to put on a different face. They say you don't smile until Christmas, and you're a teacher, and you don't you don't smile, you don't tell a joke until you you've had them for three months or so.

You got to build a level of trust and structure before you can, you know, divert from it. Have you, I'm curious, I've actually meant to ask you this, I think several times ago that I saw you, like, in your teaching career, since it was some time ago now. Now these kids are kind of coming up. I mean, they're adults now, a lot of them. Have you encountered any of them as fans of yours? Like, have you heard from any of them?

And but I was like, \"That's a very possible.\" Like, these kids are grown now. Yeah, they could have moved to different places. They could have jobs, you know? And I knew when they were 12, 13, 14. So it's strange, but it's cool. Like, I'll see comments pop up on YouTube, and they're like, \"Hey, Mr. J, good to see you still at it!\" You know? Like, students of mine. And I'm like, \"Wow, that's awesome!\" I went to the studio once, and a former student of mine was in the studio like making music.

It's it's great to see those kids doing okay. So you're acting tough through these kids, but then you're also making the music. I mean, it was there did there come a convergence point where they all discovered like, \"Wait a second!\" Yep, absolutely. Mr. Jarboe is Mega Ran. And they would come into school like, \"Hey, Mega Ran!\" Or something like that. And I'm like, \"I know we were talking about. What are you talking about? You got detention!\" You know?

I mean, you know, from the mouths of babes. I mean, they're gonna be very honest, and that gives you a different perspective on your music that you don't necessarily think of. So so I would run music by them, and we would do Freestyle Fridays where I would rap for them. If they all got a really good score on their test, I would do some raps for them.

He's finally playing with this this guy next week on on Seth Meyers, whatever. And Michael, and is like, finally, he's stuck with it, and he like, and things are happening for him now. And I'm real proud of him. And I'm curious what that transition was from not really being able to make a living off of it to making a living off of it, 'cause I played music since a very young age too.

So what does it like to be able to quit that job and make a living or because be comfortable, be able to tour and do all these kinds? Always. I'm not saying you're like, you know, the you know, **** YouTuber Muse out there, but you're I'm saying he is. I know. Honestly, it's scary as hell, you know? But I think it just happened that, you know, like you said, it's just a bunch of right things happening at the right time, and, uh, all the timing is just what helped it. And, you know, it's it's very scary, but I think it's it was something that I felt like I had to do. Like, it was I was at a it was pretty young, still didn't have kids or a wife at the time.

So it was just a matter of finding, you know, just a number of I feel like a number of signs were in the air, you know? Things would happen. I made this album, Black Materia, and and then Game Informer profiled it, and then I was playing at PAX and a lot of really bigger shows. And I thought, \"Well, maybe I can do this.\" And I just decided to step out, and that was five years ago, and it's just been working out. But yeah, I mean, people say like, \"You live in the dream,\" you know? And I think I am, you know? And it's I don't take it for granted any second. Like, I feel like, you know, I may need to go to Walmart, you know, and filling out an application or something. But I don't know them. But right now it's going well, you know.",

But it's all a matter of just taking those opportunities and taking those signs then because I think everybody gets it once in a while. You'll get a moment, but you're like, \"I'm afraid. I can't I can't take this day off of work to go meet this record producer guy or whatever.\" You know? And I think it's just taking those chances, and sometimes they work out. So was it was Capcom coming to you kind of your first moment when you were like, \"Okay, I can really do this\"? Because I remember when you first put up Grow Up, and I love that song. It's one of my favorite songs ever. Wow. And then I listened to that. This was before the Mega Ran album even. It was. Mhm. And then you had another album before that. I did The Call. Yeah.

But it's just a story of a guy who had come from a city and, you know, wanted to had dreams of fulfilling his calling in life. That's what The Call was all about. And I didn't know what that call was, you know? And then things started getting clearer after making that record. But yeah, I think it was IGN who was the first. It's probably IGN's fault that Capcom scared the hell out of me because they they posted it, and next thing you know, I had an email on MySpace the very like same day, and they're like, \"So what are you doing here?\" You know? And I'm like, \"Oh, boy.\" Naturally, you think like, \"This is something that's going to ruin you,\" you know?

And but I didn't I didn't think that was the big break, you know? Because they didn't offer me a job that. So it was more or less, \"We'll allow this to happen,\" you know? And that was great, and it did a whole lot for me and continues to. And, um, and they'd have to do that. So that's definitely one of those first signs you see where like, \"Maybe you're onto something.\" And now you have to, you know, have the courage to just kind of keep pushing, trying something else, and until things stick. So I remember with Capcom, they've been really good about stuff. And then you did Mega Ran 9 after that. And then after that, you did the Marvel vs. Capcom 2 like on the vinyl hip-hop. Made it off.

But how has it been kind of balancing the Random versus the Mega Ran stuff? Oh, that's been tough. And and I've had conversations about it. There's a new song on the new album called \"The Meeting\" where Mega Ran meets Random, and we discuss what, you know, the guy who came from Philadelphia who makes hip-hop songs about, you know, life and growing up, and the guy who raps about and they've been the voice of a video game character. And can they both coexist? And I think that they can. And I've finally discovered a happy medium where I could make songs like \"Infinite Lives\" on the new record where the concept is is video game related, but applying it to everyday life so that everyone can understand it, realize it. So even I took 10 years for me to realize that these guys can live together side by side and on the same record because what I would do is try to alternate.",

Here's a Mega Ran album.\" And the Mega Ran albums would get so much more attention, probably because of the games that they were, you know, I'm sampling from. So I just tried to find a way where I could inject my own life story, my own, you know, lessons and things like that into a into a track that may also, you know, reflect those video games that I grew up playing. So where did Black Materia fall then? So Black Materia was like the second project after, I guess, after the first two Mega Man albums. So there was Mega Ran and Mega Ran 9, and then Black Materia was 2011. And and that was the one that kind of took off for me. And I remember one day getting a phone call from a friend who said, \"Hey, you're on the first page of Reddit!\" And.",

I did a bunch of big interviews. And and then had a big tour right after that. And then MC Chris asked me to join him on tour, and we did a three-month tour of the entire U.S. And I think so it was definitely the Black Materia album that kind of jumped it off. And I didn't realize, you know, I knew Final Fantasy VII was special to me, yeah, but I didn't necessarily know it was, you know, as special to everyone else. You know, I love that so much.

And I'm like, \"Oh, I kind of cringe because I I didn't know as much about mixing, mastering, or things that I know now.\" And I'm like, \"I did another crack at that album,\" which is why being announcement, we're going to be releasing a vinyl version of Black Materia later this year, which will be the songs remixed and remastered.

One of the things I love about you both, both with Random and Mega Ran, is it's kind of your your adherence to something that you find more like prog rock or space rock or something, which is like the idea of a concept album. And that's like, and and I you find that hip-hop, but it's it's definitely not as common as it is in some way and a lot of rock genres. Um, is that kind of does that lend itself towards like the fact that you were really sampling Mega Man? I mean, that makes more sense at that time. But even with something like Black Materia, I mean, are there is that something is that an easier way for you to write? Is that the way you want to like release your your records typically? And are there like games that you're identifying in your mind that you would like to tackle from a thematic standpoint like that? Oh, absolutely. This is something that I have more fun creating in that way.",

So yeah, there's a lot of other franchises that have been on my radar for long. Golf, if you do a Mario Golf. I was thinking, you know, Arkanoid. I don't know, you know? But, um, wow. But yeah, BioShock is one I would lose. Yeah, I love a man. Mass Effect, gosh, Uncharted. You know, games that are really, really dig from the current generation that I would think about it. But I feel like I'm kind of rooted in retro. I was in Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden. I would love to see you mess with some. And then Ninja Gaiden would be cool too, and it has great music. So there are some some retro franchises, but a lot of my friends wind up doing them. You know, there's a Zelda album, but Doc Ock, he did for.",
