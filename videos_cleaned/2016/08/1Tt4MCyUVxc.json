This new critically acclaimed entry to the Deus Ex universe once again has players taking on the role of Adam Jensen with an all-new arsenal of state-of-the-art weapons and augmentations. See what all the excitement is about at deusex.com. Greg: Tim, what's your topic? Tim: That is an excellent story - I think that is your #1 story. G: Thank you very much. T: My topic is kind of similar \u2014 uh \u2014 if you wanna \u2014 G: Oh good, what drink are you making? \u2014 to put it that way \u2014 No, similar to the story you just told. So me and Colin and Kevin were walking \u2014 where were we, getting some Ramen? Colin: Yes. T: We were probably getting some sweet, nasty, Ramen. A couple of days we were walking and we see these \u2014 these tiny little girls \u2014 like 5 year olds probably, right?",

Probably 6 \u2014 6 of 'em. C: Right. They're all running around and of course the first thought we all have is 'How many could we fight?' G: Hmmm\u2026.. T: If these little shits decided to attack us right now. G: Yeah. C: Uh huh. T: How many could we hold off? \u2014 and we had an interesting conversation. We're talking 5 year olds. C: \u2014 5 year olds \u2014 so. T: A little taller than that. C: So\u2026 G: Oh shit, from the floor!? C: Yeah \u2014 yeah, definitely \u2014 5? T: Yeah, about that \u2014 K?",

We're there \u2014 getting attacked by these little \u2014 this swarm of. Nick: This hell unit. N: This reminds me of my most popular topic on GameOverGreggy Show.

G: That's how I go down \u2014 the infamous scene in Batman V. Superman where he breaks the guy's neck \u2014 gets up and they beat him \u2014 and then 1 five year old with heat vision comes in and cuts me in half.

C: Yeah, exactly, like \u2014 to me it's all about things: vigor and dexterity. As long as you can keep them at bay and you have the dexterity to kind of move around, kinda circle around, you could probably go for a while \u2014 you could probably go for minutes and minutes at a time. You'd probably do \u2014 you know \u2014 go through dozens of enemy 5 year olds at that point but the second I feel like one latches onto you or a couple get you\u2014 it's like Kramer in the Karate Dojo in Seinfeld. Like \u2014 you gotta keep them at bay. I was saying what an interesting move would be the Zangief spinning arm move. They're too short is what I thought.
