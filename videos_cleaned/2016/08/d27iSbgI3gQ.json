Yeah. He reads he doesn't like listening or watching podcasts, but he does read the transcripts. Exactly. I think that's on the list of Colin weirdness. I don't know if that's even the top 0.

But all I could think after playing each one of those games was meh. Sure, Journey was relaxing and Tales had some funny moments, but I could have watched a movie or a TV show for a couple of hours and that would have been much more fun with much better writing. So my real question is, are we as gamers not used to good writing in games so that we then we overhype any game with just okay writing? Now don't get me wrong. Some of my favorite games of all time are story driven like Uncharted, Mass Effect, or the Arkham games, or even The Last of Us, or even The Last, he says, The Last of Us.

Anyway, just want to hear your thoughts. Love you guys. Marty, are we overrating story focused games? So, um, no. First off, no, it's interesting. I agree. I disagree with a lot of what he says, but I agree that by and large, our industry tends is very insular and if you only play games and you don't read or you don't see movies or you're not caught up on TV and music, you have a hard time sort of critiquing what, I guess, good writing is objective.

Do you think Sony would ever consider adapting a similar idea for the PlayStation 5? The mobile market is big in Japan and I'm sure Sony would like to tap into it more with our own proprietary hardware. Interested to hear your thoughts. Well they tried with the Vita and they're like Vita is selling well in Japan right now but no I don't think so. I think this is Nintendo doubling down on what works for them.

When we say we don't like review scores that's what we always mean from the written perspective of if you read a review you get such a great comprehensive look at what I liked and what I didn't like and how I got to this score.

He's listening to Beyond! and likes it and Kinda Funny although he plays more games than game content. Don't know what the hell that means anyways. Thanks for such a great community.

Oh I like Alundra made by Matrix Software and published by one of my favorite publishers in the PlayStation One era. Working Designs. Alundra is a game that any fan of A Link to the Past could find themselves lost in for hours and hours top down perspective, dungeons, puzzles, action, spells, and an incredibly dark and twisted story that only gets better as the game goes on. Alundra is a timeless adventure and is absolutely is absolutely worth worth everyone's time. It's available on PSN for download on PSP, PS3, and that gorgeous little beast known as the Vita. Keep being awesome guys. PS stay away from the sequel. They blew that shit up. They blew that shit up with bad design. It was a really good PSA. Chavo Sore. One of the I really dug Alundra.

I don't know if I'd still like it but at the time it totally totally totally clicked with me. Yeah. Yeah. PlayStation One was an awesome era for that stuff. Seriously. Yeah. It was also it was that weird era where it was like the wild West for developers and was like fuck it. We can do Intelligent Cube. We can do Vib-Ribbon and we could do CD like the investments.

Apparently earlier that day someone with the name AuschwitzQuickScope called up for the same reason. I am thankful that at this time I did not care about trophies and that I have now moved on to greater names but the name still haunts me. Love you guys. Jack Nicholson. Well that was a journey. Jack was incredible. I feel comes to the conclusion of maybe still not the best choices in names. Jack really loved the idea. You mentioned Journey of like you get that moment at the end of Journey where it's like these are the travelers you met along the way and it's BukkakeWarrior and AuschwitzQuickScope or whatever.

I started this band during my sophomore year of college in 2014 with a few friends of mine. We ended up writing one of the songs on this EP but then sort of fizzled out after we played a couple of shows since we all got busy balancing jobs in school. The band sat on the back burner for all of us but I always wanted to give the one song we wrote some sort of final release.

I wrote sang and played everything besides the drum on these four songs and recorded everything in my friend's bedroom down in Richmond. 50 minutes of good time. Now that I'm graduating and soon moving to Texas I'm not sure what else is in store for this project but I'm always writing songs and who knows what could be next. Hopefully you guys and the listeners of PS I Love You XOXO can find something to enjoy from these four songs. So again this is Jared. Good Talk RVA.
