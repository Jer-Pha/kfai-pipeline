What do you What do you do over there on the game? Uh game designer. He designed that **** Okay. Here we got Kevin. He beats that **** That's what he does here. So you we kind of got to play a little bit at E3 right? And uh he did a really good job. Genevieve you were very excited. I was fine. How good was I did just as normal as anyone else. No, you did it very quickly. Took about 4 minutes and then again I don't think that's a real number. It was only four minutes and then we dubbed you Kevin GoPro Coello because you win every Go game.

They're basically uh simplification like distillation of the big franchises. So when you have like when you play Tomb Raider, you feel a certain way, you do certain things. These are uh things that we wanted to get back into Lov go for Deus Ex. It's it's completely different just because of the franchise itself. Uh it comes from a way different place. It's like near future kind of sci-fi dystopian a little bit. But it also like on a gameplay level it's all about the augmentations, the hacking stealth and bringing that into go gives us a different like feel to play with basically. Awesome.

So the go games have always kind of been like this like board game take on the the different franchises. So what's the the different uh gameplay because of the Deus Ex a lot coming from Deus Ex it's like one of the main thing that we've been seeing here is this guard guy when he sees you he turns on his shield he's going to see you on the whole line and he's chasing you. So, it's one of the most like smart enemies that we've had in a go game because like the other enemies like let's say the guard in Hitman Go just kills you if you're right there. This guy sees you from afar, turns on his Titan shield and chases you. So, like you're in danger when he sees you, which is another thing that we had before. Kevin just did the thing that we fixed on Hitman Go, which is you never get stuck pretty much. And so, he restarted the level cuz",

And so, he restarted the level cuz he wanted to start fresh. Yeah, it's one of the things we try and design the game so that you don't get stuck, but you can still like restart if you want to, but usually whatever you do, you can just like let time pass basically like waste some time in two like safe nodes puzzle will reset cuz these guys when they lose sight of you um they go back home and once they're there it's the same puzzle as before. So you can kind of play with it in a way that's that becomes less frustrating over time. you don't have to restart it. If you do a bad move, you just flee and start over. So, it's something that we've learned from the other Go games is making making a a playground more than having like a really strict rule puzzle so that basically flows better when you play it.

But here there's like a lot more story elements going on as you play. It's one of the things we kind of grabbed from Deus Ex also because it's such a core pillar of the franchise having these conspiracies having these uh like the the really like involved story from the Deus Ex. We didn't want to do the same thing obviously uh as that but we still wanted to pay a nice homage to that having not had it in the game.

He's also working with a with a group uh hacker group um on the side gathering information and all of that. So that's the this that's a school that we work with, but it's still like what Jensen does before. So Gotcha. So what what is it, right? So he was able to pick up the energy, which is what enables you to use your augments. It's pretty cool. Every time you pick one up, you can use it. And in this case, uh at this point in the game, there's only the cloak enabled. Later, you see other ones like rem hacking, uh EMP shot, and all of that.

Uh but this is also an example of how we want to do the Deus Ex versus Deus Ex Go thing where we want we know hacking is a huge thing. Uh let's say like your your first time hacking a turret in the Deus Ex feels good. It feels really nice. You want to like you you turn it against the enemies. you just step back and see the magic happen, right? It's something that we really want to have in the game, but in a way that's that's different. In a way that makes sense for our game. So, all of a sudden, we have this. Oh, no. I hit the wrong button. It's fine. You can go back. It was never go amateur. Well, look at this.

We have this game was started like four people. We're now like 10 or 1 people. We've always scaled up the production team at least 1 people. That means it's also like we focus on making the game first and we'll see uh for the rest of it later. So Jen, what are you most excited about then for this is your now third Go game that you've been a part of. What are you excited about this one? Um, clearly the team has stepped their game up when it comes to mechanics. We are the meanest we've ever been, but also the smartest.

And so the major difference that is coming to this game in specific is it's kind of solving an issue that we not an issue but a challenge that we had. Meaning that people were burning through the content after two days and we were all sweat and blood and tears of shipping the game. They were like we want more levels. It's so good. We want more levels. We finished it cuz our audience is kind of hardcore for the mobile platform because our franchises are hardcore too. And so, um, yeah, we were like, okay, how do we fix this problem? Because we're a super small team, and so it's hard for us to make handcrafted content to the same pace as people are burning through it. Um, so we're coming up after launch, we're coming up with a level editor that's called the puzzle maker feature. Um, and it's going to",

And that's what Kevin is going to be faced with in a minute is the meanest levels. Why I enjoy this game? But like from the get-go, the the challenge was that and this game was created from the very beginning as something that uh we should be able forot about the turret, guys. It did not forget though. Nope. Did it again. Did it again immediately after. Yeah. And yeah, since the game was made from the get-go with that in mind, we still have like even though the puzzle maker doesn't come out with the game because we want to iron out everything with it before we we give it to people, we still have uh he dodged a bullet there.

No, I figured it out. I I I just thought he was going to get stuck. So that was my title. Yeah, don't lose the title, guys. I don't think it's one of those kind of titles. I'm pretty sure it is. If you can't have it, no one can. All right. So, the idea here is that there's no reason for him to I got Don't worry about Oh, it charged. He's dead. And then shut. He's dead. It's done. It's done. You all wanted him dead. He's dead. I'm proud of you, guy. Yeah, thank you. Good job, dog.

Actually, the game has the engine to process data that we can just put there every week. We can put five levels every week uh for people to play. Awesome. And it's just like you finish the game, you go there, you add different things. Yeah. And we we were inspired a little bit by the the crossword puzzles in the in the New York Times where it gets like harder every day and on Sunday you're a monster if you're able to do it. But like we have this this thing where on Fridays it's going to be a hard puzzle. Uh but we we'll have puzzles for every so it's not about being like evil per se.

So, what's going on here? So, you have the there's the blue power up. What does that do compared to the yellow? What he did right now is is hacking the turret so he could walk in front of it to grab the augmentation because then um he has to go back and hack the other turret cuz the augmentation the the cloaking only lasts for one turn. So he couldn't walk both turn both turns in front of the turret without dying. So he had to go hack it in order but the other one you could clo past. That's what he did. I wasted a turn going for the extra. Yep. It's fine. Come on. I don't think you did. I think you wasted time. Well, I wasted one",

It's going to matter cuz if you look at this here in the bottom corner, it says three steps and you can complete this level in 18. Eventually, it's going to matter. Today does not matter. So, if you want the platinum or if you want like the achievements cuz there's no platinum. Uh if you want the the achievements, you're going to have to have all of them in the least amount of steps possible. So, you have to be efficient and that's what makes the game so much fun.

That means like you basically have to shape how the level works. Uh, you can break line of sights with that. You can trap enemies on them. If there's an enemy on it, when you undo it, uh, they're going to die. Same thing with you. If you get stuck on it when something unhacks one of the terminals that you hack, you get killed.

So, anyways, so um are we ready to like challenge Kevin to the death? I think uh yeah, there's a few things he hasn't seen yet. He's going to figure them out. I think he will figure it out. No, that's better than me. He's not going to figure it. No, I had to wait. I had to wait invisible then get them.

It's a nightmare. We want you. Hey we won. You know these nightmares where like anything you say does like it just doesn't matter. It just you just say things and and things.

So let's let's bring it on. All right. So basically like we wanted to to flex the some of the features in the game and we we built that's not it at all. We wanted to to show the fact that like every day you come back there's going to be levels for you there. Um not necessarily harder but usually like around the team or different kind of ideas and all of that. Uh should we go directly to like a special puzzles or can No let's go with the first one. Do as you feel. That's a Monday. We'll get to the Friday soon but that's a Monday. All right this is a Monday. So this is your Monday. We got to go through the different days. It's different.

It's not a mansion. It's not like a secret lab. It's not any of that. It's a it's a level. And we based this level around the idea of having a lot of augments. And we have to uh warn you right now, you have access to two different augments in this level. So you have access to cloak. You also have access to remote hacking. So this means you can when you use your augment, if you tap on Jensen, you're going to cloak. If you tap on a remote terminal, you're going to hack as if you were sitting there. So you have to keep that in mind with this. This is something I haven't done before. What happens when I'm cloaked? Walk into something",

One movement that that was one turn and like he cloaks out at the end of the the other. So, it's kind of where it's the board game roots of the go series, which is like a turn is when you use it until when you could use it again. Gotcha. Huh? Yeah. All right. So, do that. So, like I won't be able to go on this thing, but Guys, let me handle. Let me I got this. The rest of this show is only going to be about us making weird sounds.
