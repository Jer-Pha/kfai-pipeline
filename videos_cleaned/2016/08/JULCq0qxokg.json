Just recently they sent me down to Respawn Entertainment to check out Titanfall. Um, I got tons of hands on with multiplayer, that's what we're talking about today. I did get a glance at campaign. I have my Impressions on a separate Kinda Funny Reacts video somewhere on their YouTube channel. Anyways, this is multiplayer and overall I loved it man, it was fun and it was awesome. I had a great time playing. Essentially if you enjoyed Titanfall as multiplayer you're going to enjoy Titanfall 2 as multiplayer. Um, they didn't take chances or big risks with Titanfall's multiplayer and I've only played a small amount of this and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Like Titanfall's multiplayer was awesome and I felt like the way that they wanted to approach this was let's just build upon it, right? Let's not try and do too much, let's just make what was great and amplify that and they",

Let's not try and do too much, let's just make what was great and amplify that and they did a great job of doing that. Now I only got to play a little bit for 4 hours, but I did get hands-on with three new maps. We got Boomtown, Homestead, and Ford base Kodai and also got Hands-On with three different game modes, amped hardpoint, pilot versus pilot, and bounty hunt. Bounty hunt is the new game mode which essentially you get kills whether there it be um AI or another player and you get money for those kills essentially then you take that you turn it into a bank the team with the most money at the end wins. I got hands on with the two new Titans, Ion and Scorch as you can see right there on the screen. Um, it was fun. I love the Titans. Uh, one of the things that I kind of had an issue with in terms with Titanfall's multiplayer was the the three different Titans, The Strider, Atlas, ogre when it came",

Uh, one of the things that I kind of had an issue with in terms with Titanfall's multiplayer was the the three different Titans, The Strider, Atlas, ogre when it came down to it it kind of just felt like you know one was beefier the other one was faster and the other one was kind of the in between. These felt different and they felt like they had more personality to them. So you know when I actually got to play with the different Titans, Ion and Scorch, they had different enough abilities that made me go okay, like there's a different play style to this. It's different than just like I can move faster or I could tank more hits and so it was really really cool. Um, what you just saw right there was the anti-titan LG 97 Thunderbolt that's a new anti-titan weapon so there are a lot of new weapons and abilities in Titanfall 2's multiplayer and like I said before I just felt like they're really just taking the angle of let's build upon what was great.

Um, I did get hands on with the grapple. One of the cool things about like the grapple was it just fit into Titanfall and I like that man. I like that they didn't try and go over the top and try to add things in everything that they added just felt like it fits. The grapple was something that was a great representation of that. Titanfall's movement was one of the great things about Titanfall and the grapple just fit. I was I was able to do the tradition addtional wall run and Bunny Hop but then the grapple added and Amplified to that gameplay in the sense that I could continue that from different angles and and variations that I was not able to do that before and so I'm liking the I'm liking the way that they're approaching this multiplayer and uh I'm excited dudes it played very well if you didn't enjoy Titan",

Titanfall 2 is just essentially an amplified version of Titanfall but it's fun. I would give it a try. I know some of you guys might be like oh well you know it's it's it's not a super Twitchy FPS like Call of Duty is. Um, it's more so there's just a lot of action and moment to moment combat like that awesome Titan kill right there. Uh, like I said it's just it's just fun it's it's it's a cool multiplayer there's a lot of variety in terms of the different things you can do. I'm not one for playing my multiplayer games with you know vehicles or let alone Mech gameplay but I feel like they did a great job with the Mech to kind of just feel like a a larger version of yourself just pummeling things around you like I just punched that",

I think you guys would have a blast. Um, one of the cool things um being there is I felt like they really cared about you know the players in the sense that they they were you know they're walking around asking us questions and how we would change things and what we thought about stuff and and not only showed you know because of course we were there and they wanted to you know make us happy or anything like that but I saw that in like in the game itself you know I you know me I went into the settings I checked to see if bumper jumper was there and you know all the kind of settings I would like and I saw that there was settings for dead zones and dead zones essentially just help you know negate like drift on your analog stick but it could be very detrimental to",

Um, they also have this cool new feature from multiplayer called my networks and essentially it's kind of like an advanced Clan system you can go there you have moderators there's a chat room all that kind of stuff and uh I liked it because that was really really cool. Um, it's an awesome way to get your like casual base to kind of play together I know a lot of issues with a lot of recent games like the division or destiny kind of things like that which kind of promote playing",
