So Gus, Nick, mhm, today's question comes from 4-year-old Marcus. Marcus says, my girlfriend is really hard to deal with sometimes. Every time it gets to lunchtime, she always asks me where I want to eat. When I give her an answer, she says she doesn't want that. She then say she doesn't care where we go. Those things don't don't match up. What should I do? How do I decide where to eat? The age old question. Well, Marcus, you reached the right people. Someone who has absolutely no qualification to help you is going to help you deal with someone who I don't know. Um, to be fair, no one's qualified to deal with this specific question. There is no right. There's no person that majored in this in college, right? So I think we're going to be let us know if you did. Yeah, I I feel like this I I hear this a lot. Like a lot of people complain about this. It's really not that hard. I I think it's like",

It's really not that hard. I I think it's like ultimately just learn the places that the other person likes to go to and suggest those places and go from there. I mean, like you do have some power here. Like it's easy to think that you're powerless. But ultimately think about all the places that the other person likes and then pick your favorite from there. It's like you're still picking stuff you like just prioritize based on what you think that they're going to go along with. Like if you're with someone who doesn't like pizza, don't suggest pizza. That's a no-brainer. Of course they're going to say no. They may not care. They just may not really like pizza although everyone exactly that that's probably the worst example to use in that scenario. But so the thing with this is like this is not unique to relationships between you know you know like",

But so the thing with this is like this is not unique to relationships between you know you know like lovers. It's that's something you deal with every day. It's lunch time. We're at work. It's like where do we eat? Then it's that constant fight. I think it really comes down to weeding out the options. So it's like all right, so what do we not want? Is there any genre that we want? You know what I mean? Mexican, Chinese, Pizza. These are genres. You know, you kind of whittle it down that way and kind of go from there. It's like Asian. Okay, which Asian are we talking about? Japanese? Are we talking about Chinese? You can go from there. It's like oh, I just had Japanese. I don't want that. You need to kind of go through that that kind of just the the flowchart and you'll eventually get some good advice. What I like to do is I like to pick like two restaurants that I know that person likes and then one that I know we",

What I like to do is I like to pick like two restaurants that I know that person likes and then one that I know we both like so that no matter what the decision can be made fast because ultimately what you don't want to do is pick three that you know you like and then have to be talking the other person into it then you're just going to be like I'm not hungry anymore not doing this. Yeah, the thing I'm a little bit more picky than that where it's like I usually know like I want something and it's about convincing the other people I'm well aware of how you exactly but the key there is you never lead with the one you want you always suggest something that they like then another thing and then yours and then one more it needs to be sandwich see then you're totally doing it wrong because this is this is how this is how you operate Tim where do you want to go to lunch I don't know Nick where do you want to go",
