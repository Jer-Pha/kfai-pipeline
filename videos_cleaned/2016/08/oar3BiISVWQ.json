That was that was the thing. If he was always staring there at least that would make sense. He's doing this the entire time which is extra funny because Kevin cut to cut to this guy when there's so much attention on it when it just looks like this. Extra funny. It's true. It's true.

It might seem surprising for Univision to spend $130 million for the company and then immediately shutter its flagship brand, but the business logic behind the decision seems pretty clear. Gawker.com's brand has become so toxic that continuing to operate the site could have posed significant financial risks. Shuttering Gawker.com will allow Univision to get a fresh start. Other Gawker media sites will apparently continue operating and Univision's management will be able to get focused their full energies on them. And what we basically heard, I think, is that 95% of Gawker's employees will actually continue to work for Univision. So, it's a it's pretty unprecedented. Um, it's a pretty unprecedented deal. Yeah.

Uh, so it says Gawker's sensationalist sensationalistic journalism brought about its downfall. Gawker Media's path to bankruptcy began with a decision by Gawker.com editors to publish a video of Hulk Hogan having sex without the permission of either Hogan or his partner. Hogan sued, argued that this was a violation of his privacy. A Florida jury agreed, awarding Hogan $140 million in damages earlier this year. Gawker didn't have $140 million, so the company was forced to declare bankruptcy. The company was put up for auction with the proceeds used to pay part of Hogan's judgment. We didn't know it at the time it was filed, but Hogan's lawsuit was secretly funded by technology billionaire Peter Theal.

The has borne a grudge a grudge against Gawker since 007 when Gawker published a post titled, \"Peret Theel is totally gay, people.\" The started to look for opportunities to punish Gawker for what he saw as irresponsible journalism. These were not isolated incidents. Gawker has outed others, including CNN anchor Anderson Cooper and Shepherd Smith of Fox News. In one of its most infamous stories, Gawker reported on a New York media executive soliciting the services of a male escort. The man was not a public figure, and the piece was later removed after founder Nick Denton decided that the story had gone over the ethical line. In court, Hogan's lawyers sought to portray Gawker as an organization without a moral compass. It wasn't a hard argument to make.

As a result, arguments about media freedom fell on deaf ears in the jury box. Jurors didn't buy arguments that the First Amendment protected Gawker's right to humiliate humiliate random celebrities by publishing videos of their most intimate moments. So, here's where things get controversial. Whatever your view of Gawker's journalism, the case does raise questions about whether billionaire funded lawsuits could threaten freedom of speech.

Winning the lawsuit cost Mother Jones, a relatively small nonprofit organization, and its insurance company, $.5 million in legal fees. If Vanderloot's goal was to punish Mother Jones for writing an accurate but unflattering story about him, a loss was almost as good as a victory. His lawsuit sought $75,000 $74,999, staying just under the $75,000 threshold that would have allowed Mother Jones to move the case into federal court and away from an Idaho jury that might have favored the hometown plaintiff. So, winning the lawsuit cost Mother Jones and his insurance companies 30 times as much as the amount they would have lost if they they would have paid if they lost.

And as far as I know, no one has taken him up on the offer. But the threat of freedom of the press is obvious. Any news organization doing its job is going to make some enemies. If a wealthy third party is willing to bankroll lawsuits by anyone with a grudge, and defending each case costs millions of dollars, the organization could get driven out of business even if it wins every single lawsuit.

And because most new news organizations cover a wide variety of topics, the story that provoked a billionaire's eye might have nothing to do with the stories that actually trigger a lawsuit funded by that billionaire. In short, deals war on Gawker could become a template for other extremely wealthy people with personal or ideological scores to settle against news organizations. And that's something to worry about even if you think Gawker deserves what it's getting. Um, and then they go on and on. I want to make sure that I'm not missing anything else.

Um because the argument against this is simply this people would basically admit like or basically the administr did something wrong but because this guy has enough money to to shove them in a corner they don't have the right to necessarily do that.
