And I'm not saying they're not going to overcome it. I'm not going to say that in five years we're going to look back and be like that was **** stupid like why would we ever not want this. I still think that it would have been cooler to have a modular console but um and I think that they weren't far. I don't think either of the manufacturers were smart enough to do that and I think that if they can go back they probably would have but um because that would have been way easier for them. They have to R&D all this new **** and they can just like you can plug and play as much as you want. I think that would be way smarter. I think that's what the next consoles will be but um in",

So yeah, the Trinity though name price release date and I'm gonna say I I I'll stick I think PlayStation 4 is possible. I think something like PS4 Plus or Ps even PS4 or something like that is possible. You PS4.5 n i i that's too techy right? That's how I feel they're calling S I mean then they won't do that obviously but you know what I mean something to that.
