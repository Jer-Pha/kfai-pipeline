Like if they like I I sit down at the chess table and always expect to win unless I know that the other person knows how to play and and you can do like dickheaded moves like bringing your queen out really. You can beat a person in three moves in chess. And I I and when I don't and when I don't trust that a person knows how to play chess I do that move to like just see like like um because if you if they know if they know you're doing it if they can destroy you like they can trap your queen and all this kind of stuff. So it's a good way. It's a good litmus test but I want to like be able to sit around people. I'm not saying I'm like a **** grandmaster by any stretch of the imagination but I want to play with people that I know",

I don't But I think that's why this film was so it was very weirdly accepted like or very weirdly like like when when it when it hit people didn't really know what to think about it. I was like I should not like this as much as I do but I never like I am shocked that you like it cuz it is very very very style substance when I when I watched it the first time I think I remember hating it. Yeah. And then it wasn't until I watched it",

This is just like up until that point I had just been acclimated to a specific type of film making right? Because like in the 80s there wasn't a lot of that happening right? You were either like making cool indie films or blockbusters and it was pretty much that was my childhood. I'm not saying that wasn't going on. Obviously there's a lot of great uh uh directors doing other stuff in the 80s but my exposure to it was like Predator Total Recall all that stuff. So seeing this I'm like I don't I I don't I can't deal with this. Um and granted that was mid '90s. And then I think it wasn't until Mulan Rouge that happened and I was like oh",

But also I think I had an English lit teacher who was like that was terrible. Like the worst interpretation. I was like but I don't think you're right because this is just an interpretation of the story. And I think it's really cool cuz for a lot of people especially people my age I was 16 when the movie came out. That was the age of the characters right? And I was like this is pretty kind of cool because these are supposed to be like young teenagers in love and I'm in love and I'm kind of understanding their language a little bit more now.

But seeing it there you at least understood the emotion of what was happening even if you couldn't quite parse together. Well there's a novelty to it. the deep meaning of everything you know like seeing the characters and having them still talk that way but having the the scenarios that they're in kind of tell the story in a different way. Like it's funny cuz it reminds me him his movies remind me a lot of Tarantino movies in the sense that the music you were what you were saying earlier the music kind of motivates the scenes a lot.

The movie's two hours because in the the first uh it's exactly two hours because the in the intro bit they're like the hour traffic of this blah blah blah blah blah. It's like that's fuckin' awesome. There's a lot of little thoughts being put in there and stuff. But I want to give a shout out to the intro. When's the last movie? I don't know. Super long. But I I I'm renting it from iTunes because I want to I want to watch the intro cuz I remember it being the fuckin' coolest thing in the goddamn world. Let's look at this. Are we He also did Gatsby.

He came out with Basketball Diaries and I was like \"Holy shit this kid this kid can act and he is finds good projects.\" And then he did this and I think this is what like he was always a kind of a heartthrob but I think this was like put the poster on the wall turn the lights off and just let things get better.
