Mario World's on my list as well so I mean I'll and mine's not in any order I guess either um but the thing that made Mario World special and and I've said this before but to me Mario World is by far the best launch game ever created and by far the best bundled in game ever created so not only like an ancillary game but a first party bundled in game that people bought later on which is the same with all the Mario games and and Nintendo really was was the Marquee I think of great launch games the original Super Mario Brothers um is not technically maybe uh we we look at",
