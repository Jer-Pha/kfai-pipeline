You guys should check that out on Twitter. She she remade the uh Kelly Le Brock shot from uh Weird Science really where she's standing in the doorway. Yeah, it's pretty fun. Uh shortly after the photo session, I opened up a savings account so I could put some money aside each month in the hopes of being the fifth best friend on the Game of Reg show uh sometime September, October.

I need my brother to get down there who's younger than me. And I was like we got to figure this all out, but it's going to cost a lot of money.

And as you guys know I'm really good at asking people for money. So pre Patreon I was like I'm just going to ask the internet for money. I was really ahead of my time when you think about it. Um so I was on MySpace and I had a bit of a following there. How about how many people? Um 30,000. Oh wow. That was really good. Yeah. And I was just like, \"All right, I'm just going to ask them for money cuz that's that makes sense to me.\" So I made this whole campaign um to Coin Star Tim's Way from the Bay to LA.

It just sounds like things that I was doing last night to prep for the stream. Um so I did that and there's this whole whole image and stuff and then I made like four different variations for each of my friends. We all made our our MySpace profile pictures. It so our top eights were just like ridiculously promotional. It was like you know really really good choice. So cuz I decided that everybody has the the coin things in their house that have all the pennies and quarters and nickels and dimes and stuff. holes like and if they no one uses them.

Like up until uh like the college era I was like all right if I work this many hours I can get a game or two games or what. Now if you think about it it's like when you're making money with the look when you get to real salary numbers it's like if you were think about video games that's crazy.

But the funny thing about that is I I I worked at this deli and the only reason I stopped working there was I broke my shoulder or my collarbone and I couldn't work for a few months. And I remember going back. I had about $500 to my name at that point which was the most money I ever had. And I remember going back a couple months later and the woman that owned it she was a nice woman. She she was like \"So do you want to like come back because like it seems like you've been fine for like 3 weeks you know?

I taught myself after effects. So Fran was like \"This guy knows motion graphics. she's going to take us into the next century. And I did. You did IGN and strategize? Oh man that dope ass intro.
