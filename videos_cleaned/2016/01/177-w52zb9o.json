What's up everybody? Welcome to PS I Love You XOXO, episode 17. I am one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside he only does everything, Colin Moriarty. It's good to be here. You did spend your entire end of 2015 in Japan. I did. Yeah, you went over there. Uh-huh. Real just a spur of the moment thing. I haven't been to Japan. Are we really going in April? Yeah, we're really going. We haven't made, we haven't talked about it lately and we haven't moved on it. Remember we haven't talked to you about anything lately? I'm just letting you know this specific thing. We're like two ships in the night right now, except now the ships have run head on into each other and they're getting it on.

His TV persona, the books though, I'm asking about the books. Ringo Starr was the storyteller in the, in the television show, replaced by George Carlin. Wow, that was a, you, you definitely exchanged an Apple for an orange there. Alec Baldwin portrayed Mr. Conductor and Thomas and the Magic Railroad and narrated, you are a disgusting little pig, Thomas. What is this show about? It's about a Tank Engine That Could apparently could sell a lot of books. Thomas had his genesis like Winnie the Pooh and a toy for a small child, both coincidentally named Christopher.

However, as we approached our final deadlines and started wrapping up the game's levels, we realized that several key sequences needed extra resources to bring them to the finish line. After carefully considering all of our options, we decided to extend our schedule, making sure that we got a few more polish passes, polish passes before submitting our Gold Master, the final disc for manufacturing.

There you go. This is what, so if they can really nail a Fight for Fortune, Fight for Fortune is so obscure that 95% of the people listening to podcast have no idea what the **** that game is. Well, that's just the Vita. The Vita is so obscure. Remember when they announced that out of nowhere? They announced that on like a Friday, came out on Tuesday. I think I got my code that weekend.

I was wondering, what are your top favorite open world games of all time? I read the question, immediately jumps mind, Infamous, the original. I've written about my affinity for this game, why I love this game, but just that being, getting to be, and it sounds so, you know, such a novelty now because there's these Batman games and a million other things going on. But someone, you know, thank goodness Sucker Punch being talented, someone talented taking the superhero genre, making an original character, making uh, a game that they can put years of their time into and making an open world was awesome.

And run around and grind on rails and get more powerful and take on stupid side missions and go, you know, where's the camera or the photo looking at me and go get it and do all these different things. And then like the fact that there was the light and dark path and the choices and the different thing there, like that was great. And I don't get me wrong, like as we go further, I mean, we can, we always talk about it, right? The fact that I think Second Son's the best gameplay, you know what I mean?

PlayStation's making a superhero game, game, and it's open world and it looks awesome.\" You're like, \"All right, great.

Remember that I gave the caveat that I don't think the hand-in-hand combat's anything to write home about. It's worse than Mad Max. And isn't Batman? The car combat is **** rad in the game. Okay. Um, so yeah, I would give a shout out to that as well. But I'd really have to think. I'm sure I'm missing something.

Crysis, of course, is really the inspiration for Far Cry. And there are others. And I like the original Crysis a lot as well.

Yeah. Um, so it's unclear like how it's all going to shake out. I just want a Far Cry game.

I think that these are going to be more quaint ideas at some point that I think uh, we will want to know more about. And it would be nice to instill this kind of stuff in our kids. It's like with politics, right? Like um, the Republican Party, for instance, uh, is whatever it is, you know? And then people look at it, whatever it is. But like it's important to know that the Republican Party founded in 1856 and, you know, Abraham Lincoln was the first elected president that they put up, you know, that that that won. And the Republicans, you know, went through the wilderness a few times. Stuff like that. Like, is that really relevant to vote Republicans today? Probably not. Is it interesting? I think so. Sure.

Is it, all right, you guys, you've gotten every, you've gotten, you've beaten Mario and done all the secret stuff and da da da. So now you get to move on to, is it Mario, Mario 3, or is it on to Super Mario World? Or, you know what I mean? Like, I don't know how many, how many leaps you want to make with it, right? It's complicated. Yeah, it's very complicated. It's going to, well, that's the least your worry. But I think that the, I think that it comes down to your own personal taste.
