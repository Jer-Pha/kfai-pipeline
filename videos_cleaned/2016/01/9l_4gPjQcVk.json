You know, you have any thoughts in your head of what that should look like cuz what we did last year it was a on January 5th actually we put out a first Gamescast topic. I think the first Gamescast topic ever was what's the game of the year 2015 yeah or 2014 and we all just kind of gave our personal ones, our one personal one and that was it. Sure we could do that again or we could do that and then kind of argue about what the one Kinda Funny Games one is or I don't know. Nick, yeah what's your game of the year? Metal Gear. Okay, Nick is Metal Gear so just just so everyone knows for so either it was down to Metal Gear and Axing Verge it was oh you're right yeah you played Arkham too I forgot about that which was phenomenal and I agree with yeah it's fine don't worry we hear you we love you I Gotta Give A all right I mean I don't know like the thing about it is I always I appreciate",

No game captured my attention more. I didn't have more fun with a game for is you know that was amount of hours um yeah I mean it's just so weird because it's just on paper I shouldn't like Metal Gear that much you know what I mean it doesn't have hater who is snake to me it doesn't have the Metal Gear story which is what Metal Gear is to me but it has this gameplay that I just can't get enough of like you know it's one of those things Nick always gives",
