I am one of your hosts Greg Miller alongside HeOnlyDoesEverything Colin Moriarty. It's so fucking bright in here. You think it's just blower? Is that the problem? I don't you really don't notice that? Like I can't. I'm with you. It looks brighter. It doesn't look like it's not it's not I gotta like sit like this. It's not you want my gunners? I'll go get the gunners. Should I go get my gunners? No. You want me to wear my gunners? I just it's too much. You want me to raise it up for you? You raise me up.

I'm not even you want to slide back on the table? You want to slide back on the table? I'm not commercially thing. Like I can't look away from you because if I look that way even Socrates knew you can look at the sun. You had to look at the eclipses in water. Even he knew that. How did he know that? Did other people go blind or something? I guess so. Isn't that the whole thing with the eclipses? Oh I thought you were going to say the ancients. Okay. It's just that you can't look at you can't look at the sun to begin with. You're not supposed to look at the sun to begin with, right? So even the eclipses.

God knows how long. Suck it Mrs. Gustafson. Never thought about it again. Ninth grade. Had earth science. Mr. Nielsen exclaimed that if I didn't already go blind from it I will go blind eventually from looking at the eclipse. But here's the problem. Lay it on me. So you don't look at the eclipse because it is an optical illusion, right? So like the... Wait what do you mean? You don't look at the eclipse? You know why you don't look at an eclipse? No, I don't know. It's because... Because you go blind. That's what everybody says. Yes because the moon for instance is way smaller than the sun but it's an optical illusion and it's blocking",

I'm with you. I'm with you. I'm with you. So I was paranoid about that for a few years. Sure. You were just waiting for it to happen. Yeah. Like... You're like Ralphie in a Christmas story. Any second you're going to go blind. So there's that funny story. But then there's the story of when you're driving or you're like just around... And then, you know, I drive cars. You're driving a giant bus. Cranking the wheel to get around the corner. You know when the sun's setting and you can look directly at it and it doesn't hurt your eyes? Sure. You know what I mean?

Did you ever go back and tell that teacher to stuff it up his ass? No, because who knows? Maybe he's right. I mean, this happened in 1993. 3 years ago I looked at that eclipse. Sure. But if you go blind now it could be for a number of reasons. Is my math right? Yeah, I think it is. Okay, go on. That was pretty much all I had there. You could go blind for a number of reasons. Maybe you get the daredevil sight powers you always talk about. When I was in San Diego last weekend and I put the Drano in the drain I was afraid I was going to go blind from that. Right.

Number one, they pulled the fucking classic flight attendant move that I haven't heard in several years. And I've flown literally a hundred times in the last couple of years. They pulled the classic R computer. We can see... They start to taxi or whatever. They stop? No, no. It was when we were descending. And they're like, we can see that someone has service on their phone. It's interfering with the computers. I'm like, you're so full of shit with this. But I thought it was funny.

Come on, right there. Getting my points. There you go. Sir Richard Branson. We'll disappoint about something. What happened now? My points were... I have my points, but my meter to become elevate silver was reset. I know. I told you to get the credit card. It would have helped you. It also doesn't let your point... It never expires.

That wasn't even enough. Didn't you get silver status just because... That's fucking bullshit. No, no, no. You're wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong. What happens is you get status points on Virgin America. I think you get like 15000 or whatever it is. Status, which then puts you within 5000 of silver. Then I got gold just because.

Then I asked Christine about it this last time, this last year as we went into 016. She said because we're credit card holders, our status never expires. As long as I have the status, I'm always going to be gold. What is the benefit of being a silver or gold? Do you get discounts? Yeah. You don't have to pay for your bags anymore. Oh, I don't care about that. But do you get ticket discounts? No. Then useless. It's all useless. Oh no. You can get into main cabin and main cabin express and select without having to pay any extra money for it. Okay. That's something. You get the companion ticket.

The best is when you get on Virgin America, you get in the main cabin, select or whatever the exit rows you get put in there by not mistake, but like they upgrade your whatever for something and then you get the free drinks and the free food and the free movies.

But I do feel like I missed the boat on being able to talk about this earlier. You know what I mean? It's one of those games that if I'd been playing it while it was happening I would have been telling more people to go play. So if you're watching this and you care about it if you're at all interested in Life Is Strange go play Life Is Strange. Great story cool gameplay. I like it. What is happening? What? If you're all interested in Life Is Strange go play Life Is Strange. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. All right. You know how it is. Like you hear about a game like that sounds interesting",

We have to talk about do you think we often talk about you talk about how people ask is going to be a video to you like I don't think so but PlayStation is crazy enough to do it. Do you think what are the odds you think there's a Vita to or something less than 5%? Oh wow. I think that they probably prototyped a lot of stuff but I but I think I don't think it's it doesn't make sense. I'm just saying that they're they're crazy enough to do.

I just don't believe conventional wisdom that handhelds are irrelevant. I mean a hundred percent. I think that they're certainly not as useful as they used to be anymore because of the rise of smartphones but everyone knows smartphone gaming is largely like you know garbage and that handheld gaming is for gaming purists and hardcore gamers.

And I don't really see feel like that that's happened. I feel like other things killed Vita. Um three DS you know as is selling very respectively not like the original DDS sold but 50 60 million units is nothing to sneeze on. I think if Sony could even get half of those I think they would release another Vita or another handheld. So I mean if I was if so even molding the question if they were crazy enough or if they were to go over you go back in time and do it. What I'd want to see is pretty simple. I love the Vita.

I think I think the complication is like there's hardware complication. Yeah we need more triggers and stuff like that. I totally disagree with you. I don't think that I think the back touch can go. I don't think I don't think the touch screen is like a problem. I don't really I really I don't I don't get that argument.

Danganronpa games can be played all on the touch screen. But do you play it that way? Is that the best way to play it? Yeah well it depends.

I know people that feel that way. So it's one of those situations where bigger is not always better longer is not always better in games. And we have to look at you know Firewatch could be a really tight four or five. It might be dev math. It might be three hours long for a week. I don't know. And I'm not real quick. I'm super excited for Firewatch. I'm doing the exact same thing he is on media blackout. I don't know. I don't even know anything about it. So the interview might have been to what he's saying maybe 00 percent it to do whatever. It's a combine. You know what I mean? Like talking about dev math maybe one play through his two hours. Dev math is the principle that I made up for people that don't know that you know you can always you know subtract several hours from any developer's prediction of how long game is.",

Dev math is the principle that I made up for people that don't know that you know you can always you know subtract several hours from any developer's prediction of how long game is. They say it's 16 18 hours long. It's probably like 1 to 14 hours long. Yeah. So you know like Journey for instance is a game you beat in like an hour and it's a fantastic one of the great games of last generation way better than a lot of games that are 100 hours long. So I just don't understand the obsession per se with game length per se because I think that sometimes a game can be too long. Sometimes a game can be too short. Sometimes I don't want the game to end. But like for a shooter a single player shooter I would love Wolfenstein because it's like 15 hours long. It's awesome. It's better than like six to eight hours that you get in a campaign with Call of Duty if you're playing on normal difficulty.

So I think that we have to look at things a little differently. If you're disappointed because Firewatch is only going to be five to six hours according to them then were you ever really interested in playing it at all? You know because that's that is the experience. I guess that's what I'm saying. No that's the thing too is in the specific example of Firewatch that's more than what I was expecting. Again not knowing what kind of requirements they're putting on this I was expecting a Gone Home two hours. You know what I mean? Yeah it looks like a walking simulator.

And I want it to be that because what I play these games for is the story. I don't want it to be needless filler that I'm doing this and finding things that aren't related to the story. Tell me your story and let's get out of it. Yeah. And I don't use walking simulator as pejorative by the way because I actually like those games a lot. Sure.

I'm always agreeing with Colin's opinions about single player over multiplayer and so on. I always hear you guys shitting on Knack and I figured I'd speak up for the game and admit I really liked it. Felt like a mix of Katamari and God of War. I could honestly see a sequel that fixed and improved on the original. P.S. Compare trophies and you'll see I play just like you guys in case you think I'm full of shit after reading this. I'm going to answer your... Yeah. You chimed in. We appreciate you chiming in.

Five to six years old at this point but you brought it up not too long ago. Okay. You brought up the you brought up PlayStation Minis. Oh I did bring up Minis. Which was a which was a weird I don't know what the fuck it was but it was a it was an initiative that was a PSP and PS3 and these games can kind of be played on both and they were supposed to be small bite-sized almost mobile inspired games.

I really want people to just go play it. It came out at a dollar 99. I think it can it's probably not even that expensive anymore. It's probably gone up in price. You would need I don't know if you can play it on Vita but you could play it on PSP or PS3. It's just a great game. Cheap. It was fun. I forgot about space shooter for two bucks.
