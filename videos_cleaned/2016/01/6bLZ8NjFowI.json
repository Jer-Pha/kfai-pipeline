So Steve and I had a little bit of a conversation over at lunch today, although we kind of cut it short because I don't, you know, as Greg always says, \"Save it for the show.\" Yeah, you don't want to burn cast. No, no, no, no. My, my, my theory on this is, and it's been the same, and we've talked about this, you know, ad nauseam on PS I Love You and and on Colin and Greg is, and even on Podcast Beyond, I mean, we've been talking about this for a long time is that we just been talking about VR. VR is forever. Make you want to throw Kevin out of the window. We've talked about VR so much. The 90s are back, yo. VR, the promise of VR is real. I, I believe it. And, um, you know, I'm not, I'm not in, I'm not into gimmicks.

Eventually you just realize that waggle, for instance, and motion control is probably not the way you want to play games. Um, I honestly feel that, um, touch-based games have a place, but they're limited and you're not going to be able, that's not the revolution that we need either because it's you, you can't really effectively play a shooter or a platformer. There are some clever digital controls, but they're not, it's not tactile, right? When I played VR for the first time, uh, EVE: Valkyrie, uh, years ago, I was like, this is astonishingly f***ing good. Um, and I don't know if the burn is going to be slow or really slow. I don't think it's going to be anything more than slow, but I do think that we, VR is going to stick and it will be",

Um, I don't think it's going to replace the way we play games now, as I've said for for decades to come, we will play with a controller in our hands looking at a TV. I don't think that's going to change our computer screen or whatever, a laptop, whatever it's going to be, or a phone or a tablet. Um, but I do think VR, the promise of VR is real and I think that, um, and I think that I'm seeing haterism on, oh no, sorry, sorry, sorry. Nick just walked by and gave me, started dancing in the doorway. Sex. Why do you hate good shows, Nick? Why are you ruining my cadence, Nick?

Uh, so, so, so anyway, the, the, the point I was trying to make was that it's, it's good. This is, yeah, I, I don't think, I think there's going to be a lot of forced nonsense with virtual reality. You have to look at in term, in terms of PlayStation Move or something like that where like there's some things that proved that PlayStation Move could work, but it ended up being a gimmick. I always talk about Sports Champions as being a far superior Wii Sports. Um, but it was, it was old and and and wrought at that point. Like that's not what people want to do. Like Sports Champions was actually really impressive, especially the second one, um, in terms of the way it felt, you know, using, you know, both of them to, you know, shoot arrows and stuff like that. It was just way more immersive. Uh,",

It was just way more immersive. Uh, but it was too late. I think Sorcery, um, and, uh, Medieval Moves are the two examples of games that were actually really f***ing good on PlayStation Move. But but for all of those games, there was a lot of garbage and it died. I think with VR, there's going to be games that are not going to be good and games that are going to be good, but it's the practical utility of VR beyond games that I think is going to get these things into people's homes and games to me are just the beginning, as we've talked about in the past. Um, so when I saw Oculus's price, uh, I wasn't super surprised because Palmer Luckey was being super coy even with the pre-order announcements and and that that telegraphed everything you need to know that that was not going to be cheap. Um, but then the, the, as as as an audience member told us in",

Like one of those really new beautiful, you know, LEDs or something like that. We wouldn't, we wouldn't, we wouldn't think twice about that. You might, you can buy a $500 TV if you want. Yeah, but if you want high-end tech, you're going to pay for it. And so is it really that surprising that a f***ing virtual reality headset that you're going to put on your head and has two OLEDs in it, even though I don't think that's that's the reason it costs so much and all these kinds of things, is it surprising you pay $600 for it? No, not really. I think so. I think that our expectations certainly on PS I Love You with PS VR, we might, we might",

I guess I, I mean, the only thing I'd say about that is that in Oculus's case, it's $599 on top of the cost of a really powerful PC. And we're talking really powerful PC. It was one of those things where I, I was on the side of like, come on, guys, like it really can't be that bad. And because I'm just assuming that even a normal PC can use it. Our laptops, which are ridiculously state-of-the-art last year, granted, yeah, um, I would imagine would be able to run it, no problem. They have this like, uh, compatibility thing that you can run and I ran, there was two out of five things that it was like, this PC can't do it. Granted, it's a laptop.

That's the problem with, and I think that speaks to what they're going for though, you know what I mean? I think that's been Oculus's deal from the get-go is that I think it's been appealing to the same way the PlayStation VR headset appeals to hardcore PlayStation fans. I think Oculus appeals to hardcore PC fans. I think, I mean, it's very much an early adopter thing, you know, and I, and I think that it's not really surprising that it's pretty darn expensive for the first time it's ever available. I don't think, I don't think they're trying to say this is going to be something that millions of people are going to buy right now. And it's just not targeted. Like I think they're consciously not targeted that they're like, if you're super invested in having this experience, you can get it now. Yeah, if you want",

Yeah, if you want to not be the first, you know, to jump in the deep end, a couple years from now, it'll probably be a couple hundred bucks less, you know? And I, I think they're conscious of that. They just want to get it out there before they can sell it for $300. Over on, over on the AMA, he was saying that, you know, they didn't want to do it cheap so every, everyone can get it. They want to do it right. And it's like, it's going to cost more, but at least it's the experience that they want to, want to give. And I think that is a good thing in terms of talking about the TVs and stuff and the pricing on all that. It's like, you're right, like those things we would spend that much money. And with any tech, like you do got to spend money, whether it's an iPad or a phone or this or that. The difference is like, you, you'd spend",

Like I'm the type, f*** yeah, I'm the type of f*** that's like, oh, there's an iPad Pro. Do I want it? You know, like I question Apple f*** watching all this f***. And it's not just Apple products, it seems like that now, but it's not. Um, but but with the, with this VR stuff, it's like, I, I'm interested in it, but $600, I'm like, oh, f*** that. That's a lot. It is. I mean, but the thing is, is that I, I think, see, here's the thing to the TV example. Like you buy a TV that good, you can watch anything on Netflix on it, anything on Amazon on it.

And the thing that I feel like no one's been able to answer when I've asked about it is like, I understand that VR as a abstract experience is like cool and inspiring, but like, is there actually a killer app for it? What is the kill? Why do I need? What do I want to do with this thing? Yeah. And people are like, Elite Dangerous is really cool. EVE: Valkyrie is really cool. It's like, is it a massively overpowered PC plus a headset so that I can have like the one experience of sitting in a couple of spaceship cockpits?

And I feel like even though it's the early adopter first pass, more expensive than most people are going to want, I still think it's kind of a bad sign that I'm like, if I spent that money, what would I even be doing with it? Why aren't there, why isn't there stuff ready for me to like use on on this thing? Yeah. I mean, it's funny you said killer app. And I think it's like even less than that, where it's just, it's not the killer app. It's more what are all the apps? Like it should be all of the things.

And so earlier we were talking at lunch about the VR and it being 2D. Like you were saying that VR needs to be 3D. I never really thought about that because we always talk about the just, I just, it's a good way to just shut off and be able to play a game. Would we even be able to play just a 2D, just a game, but not even using the VR capabilities of it, but just looking at a 2D screen? It, it would have to, it's the way that they're planning on doing like Xbox One streaming to Oculus where it's basically like there's a virtual screen that's in front of you. So, but it still is in a 3D space. Yes. So, so they have to put a 3D plane in front of you that you can like, like look around or whatever. It can't, there is no concept of just like a screen in front of you. Like, you know how when you play, when you play a video game, when you play an FPS,",

Like because there is no concept of like that where that should be in the space. Yeah. It has to be in, it can, it can be 2D elements, but they have to be in 3D space. So it has to be like in the depth of the world compared to and like in an FPS for instance, you need to like have a body so can reference yourself to. There's just a lot of ways that you can't just say take game X and throw it in VR. It really has to be designed for it. I think that's what, I think that's kind of what the like, like Wii Remote analog is, you know, like the things that made the Wii Remote worth having were like Wii Sports, like games that were like, this game is designed around this, you know, um, you didn't want to really",

And yeah, I'm not convinced that what VR is actually like inherently good for that nothing else can do is like broad enough that there's going to be enough to it that you're like, oh yeah, I got to keep having more and more and more and more experiences on this headset. So I got to have one, you know what I mean? I think I feel like that's the Guitar Hero/Rock Band curse, you know, you're like, everybody has Guitar Hero/Rock Band peripherals even either in their closet or at the or at Goodwill, um, because you bought it eight years ago. You played a bunch of Guitar Hero, you played a bunch of Rock Band. You've played Rock Band 4, you played Rock Band: Beatles. You played and you're sort of",

And I fear that VR is that on a like consumer mass entertainment level. I think VR is a lot more, uh, has a lot more potential for like practical uses like training doctors and doing like flight training for pilots and like, I don't know, like, I mean, it's not like this is my favorite use of it, but like probably like controlling a drone that you're flying over Afghanistan or something, right? Um, and also there's the whole thing that like when they announced that Facebook bought Oculus, the like the first thing that Zuckerberg said it was like, it's like your Lakers, I mean, courtside at a Lakers game.

You don't necessarily want to be like, I'm going to gear myself up so I can sit on my couch and put on a headset and and watch basketball tonight, you know? Yeah. So I don't know. I, I'm, I'm skeptical of the long-term like broad appeal of it, just the potential for like how we're picturing it being like a consumer entertainment like in-home device. But I'm not saying that's like, I don't know that that's my perspective on it. I, I don't know if I see the version of like, oh yeah, everybody's got VR in their house every like 10 years from now.

Yeah, for me, I think that, uh, I agree with you and I agree with Colin too about it being a slow, like I don't think it's going to be a failure, but I do think that it's going to be slow. But every experience I've had with it has been amazing. Like a lot of them, you know, it's not, they're not perfect, but every single time I am asking what else can I do? And there has been answers so far. You know, cool novelties, the one time you play them. That's, that's the thing is so far they are just cool novelties. But and here's, I've said this before, but my big problem with it is I remember when the Wii came out and I was like, oh man, Wii Sports is so cool because it's, it gets my gears turning of what do I want to play with this?

And I think I'm in that stage now with this VR. It's like, you know, we play the that horror demo that we, The Kitchen, yep. And I was like, this is incredible. I can only imagine what a real horror game would be, not just this little slice. Or then we at a PSX, I played the Until Dawn: Rush of Blood. And I'm like, this is awesome. This is so much fun. But it reminds me, it's fun in the same way mobile games are fun where it's just like, oh, it's cool. It's a cool little distraction. I don't really need a full game.

I think that disconnect is just too strong to really just let you navigate a space like that. I feel like that's, this is because that's what I when I played RIGS at, uh, PSX, right?

And so my, my counter to it is, I really feel like it's just we have to learn. It's the same way when we move from D-pad to analog or even now when you hand somebody who doesn't play a game is a thing, right? And they're like, yeah, let me play. And they're looking everything, getting into like mouse keyboard when you first start trying to play. That's just, that just doesn't make sense, period. Everybody knows that. And you're right, you're, you're totally right. And so maybe, maybe that is more of it. Maybe it just has to become a convention and it has to be refined and it has to become more intuitive than it is now. And it is totally viable. Yeah.",

And it is totally viable. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I mean, that was, that was what I was thinking is what Greg was saying was that I don't even remember learning dual analog sticks, but at some point we had to. And we were really introduced to like single analog sticks and C sticks and all those kind of thing. Although dual analog sticks were coming out on PS1. And, um, no, I totally remember learning FPS controls on Halo 1 and just being like, like, yeah, absolutely. It's jacked up for a while. So I think to me, in in my, because I agree with you that I think it's, it's the, the, the experience works best in sedentary kind of ways.
