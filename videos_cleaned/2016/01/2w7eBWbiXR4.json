Tim, yes, take me home. Okay, tonight, um, we talk about food a lot on the show, usually fast food, yeah, or cold cuts. Um, yes, I want to talk about the kind of middle ground. We've spoken about BJ's before. I wanted to open up the table, wa whoo, explain a bit more than that. You know, we talk about them a lot. That's good.

Get the chicken sandwich there. I enjoyed it. I remember when I first moved here, we went to BJ's all the time too. Got that like, you know, the Pizookie, the buffalo chicken pizza pie, hold the barbecue sauce, add extra buffalo sauce, no celery, no onions, please. They always fuck it up. Nine times out of 10, they fuck it up. And so loved it all. Remove from it by 8, nine years or whatever, because everything is my mom, my favorite's when my mom comes to visit or when I'm visit my mom and we talk about food in San Francisco, and she always goes, oh, Gregory knows all these great hole-in-the-wall restaurants in San Francisco.

Like Poes is like the closest thing to a chain, because there's a million of them, because they've been a successful local business or whatever. Being removed from chain restaurants, God damn, do they suck? I can't, you go back now, like, yeah, oh my God, you try to go, I, when I, when we went to BJ's after I, I had been to BJ's in years, and it was like, let's go to BJ's. Like, yeah, I'll get, then the pizza came. I like, like, this is service, fuck awful. Why do you have all these tables if you can't take care of them? You know, nobody cares.

But it's still the same thing of just like, I mean, we sat there for 10 minutes and everyone's like, and then we had the, the obligatory, oh, has anyone helped you? Yeah, no, no one has. Can we, oh, I'll get someone. And then no one was there for another 10 minutes. Yeah, um, yeah, there was a time and a place where, you know, when you're in Orange County or you're in the suburbs of Southern California, like everything everywhere you go is a chain restaurant. So I went to Fridays like a thousand times, because it was open late and I like the wings.

Not a lot of it, but there is really good food. Like The Tipsy Pig we mentioned earlier was really, really good, right? But and you that to TGI Fridays, you're like, it's no comparison, right? Um, but I, I have had better service probably overall in my life. I've probably had better service at chain restaurants than I have anywhere in San Francisco. But is that just the quantity, you think, stacked up? Probably. But also, it's because when there's pros and cons to having a chain restaurant, right? You have a corporate structure, and the corporate structure dictates the steps of service and how those companies are supposed to exist, right? So TGI Fridays, like, I had friends that worked at TGI Fridays, some of my brother's friends worked",

And you're supposed to check back every few minutes, and you're, yeah, always, right? And you're supposed to treat every table like it's one big table, so that you're, when you go to one table, you go to the next table, next table, next table, and you do, and you don't kill yourself with different trips going back and forth, which doesn't always work out, but at least it's a nice plan of attack. Sure, I get that. But, and but it comes back to, I think, like when you're at a, a hole-in-the-wall local restaurant or whatever, right? Usually the table size are smaller.",

So I was in, well, I was in Santa Cruz over the, over the break, over New Year's. Um, and granted, it was one of the only restaurants open that day, because it was New Year's Day. But we went to this, this little diner that was like independently owned, and I'm looking around and I'm like, this person is serving us, but it's also has tables in the patio, and it's also like over there. And, and I'm like, there's no idea of sections here. Now, maybe someone got drunk the night before and didn't show up for work and threw everything off.

This is their career. Exactly, right? Um, I'm with you. I understand that that's where there is, I think, the fact that like, I'm painting with a really broad brush when I'm like, chain restaurant sucks. There's clearly probably great ones or whatever. And then it's the same thing where like, not every local, just because it's small, doesn't mean it's going to be great, kind of thing, you know what I mean? But I mean, yeah, you think back to all these places. I mean, I remember Chili's, and I'm talking about the unlimited chips and salsa. Great it was. And then like, going home and just being like, like there's no water in your mouth, because all it was was salt, you know what I mean?

Also, your taste change, right? And that's something that you don't really think of ever. As you get older, your actual tastes do change. You get tired of the things before, and physiologically, you start to crave earlier other things. The other example, I mean, is like Olive Garden. I remember like when, oh man, I love, I got in a fight with my girlfriend in college, fuck it, I'll pay for the Olive Garden, you know what I mean? Let's go out and be like, have like a romantic nice dinner, right? Because it's pasta, and maybe someone when you're there at your family, right?

Um, went to the Olive Garden when I went back to Chicago a few years ago, and it was one of those where I had kind of shoved it down all my friends' throats so much about the Portillo's that I couldn't make a play to go to Portillo's. Like it was like one of our last, it was Christine and me, me and Christine, and then another couple or two, I forget. And they were like, oh, and they were like, Olive Garden. I was like, I have no cards to play in this, and I haven't know Olive Garden, so I'm probably just, you know, in my head, blah, got like a, it was awful. It was so bad.

Same thing, I remember when, uh, Game Scoop, when we hit episode 100, so now I'm going back years and years and years and years and years. But when we hit episode 100, we went out as an IGN with like Dunham and Dan Adams and me and Damon. We went to Red Lobster, and everybody got Red Lobster stuff. We were all so excited, and the biscuits are so good. And then that came, and I was like, this is fuck terrible. This is awful. Why are we doing this? I'm not a fan of Red Lobster.

And it wasn't until recently that when Gio was telling me that like, I think about restaurants in ways that she could never comprehend. And it's the same with me, like me and Kevin are the same as this, where it's like, the food is just one, one of many aspects. It's all right, what type of sodas do they serve? Is it refillable sodas? How quickly are we going to be seated? Are the people going to leave us alone, but also be there when we need them to? Um, what is the free appetizer that they bring? Olive Garden, does Olive Garden suck? Yes, it does. Does it give you a fuck ton of free breadsticks that are awesome? Yes, it does. Outback, they're brown bread. What is that made from?

And it's like, there's all these like little factors that add on top of each other. Or, um, Red Robin, the, the bottomless fries. You got to factor all this in to your meal plan. And then, of course, you add the appetizers. And it's like, depending on the size of your group, like when I'm going to these places, I have a battle plan of what that night's going to look like. The quality of the food is nine times out of 10 not what I'm thinking about. I'm envisioning the experience and the meal that I'm about to have. And is it good enough? Is the question. Now, do I get bad food all the time? Yeah, I do, you know. But a lot of the time, I'm fine with that. I like the fact that I get to sit, and I like the fact that when you go to these places, you're, you're going to be able to sit down pretty quickly.

It's like, I could sit here for fuck five hours. And these little independent places, there's lines out the door. You know, you have to plan your trip three days in advance to make sure that you're timing it right, so that with traffic and with parking, with this and that, you don't need to worry about this. They got parking lots. I, that's why they're, they're in the suburbs, right? Because it's just sprawl, and they can be anywhere and do whatever. I hear you. I understand what you're saying.

I remember when Macaroni Grill, you like, we, we're going, we were going to not prom, uh, homecoming or whatever, and we went to, we went to Macaroni Grill. Macaroni Grill. See, and that's the other thing that fascinates me so much, is there's so much I just simply don't know. The world is a vast place. Do you guys have Benihana out here? No, no, but I know Benihana, Benihana in Columbia, Missouri. They used to do like unlimited Wings Wednesday or some shit like that. Hooters has that here. Yeah, Hooters wings suck. They fuck sucks.

Uh, Brandon and I used to go down to the one Palo Alto, all the way down there. You guys closer. Um, what I mean, but I think there's a certain comfort and consistency, right?

The Marina is always over, which is why I don't go out dinner in my neighborhood ever. Like the, the place I went to last night was in the Migs. Like it is very stressful. It's not, it's not, I don't understand what you guys are talking about, the stress of going to nice restaurant. Here's, go to OpenTable, make a reservation, and go there at the time.

They were on their way. What if they were late? And then they give the rest, then my wife starts looking at me like, uh oh, like it's Nick's birthday, and they, they just gave the table away. And, and I'm looking out, there's plenty of tables left, but they're taken, maybe, right? Because, oh, those are reserved. Like no one's been sitting there for like three hours.

So like the, and I don't mean that as as a good thing or a bad thing. You just don't have the New York City experience. It's not to say like Sbarro, like the famous Office, uh, joke about like how Michael goes to Manhattan and gets his favorite pizza, faar, whatever. These chains exist, but New York City is like a hot of great food, and like, you know where to go, and you can go to any bagel shop or any pizza",

But if you want to eat high-end, you can do that too. And so my, like my, uh, exposure to that didn't happen until I really moved to San Francisco. And it really didn't happen until I wasn't making 40 or $50,000 a year anymore either. So, you know, like when we were barely scraping by, and I was actually when we went out the other day for Cin's, uh, um, engagement party, like eight or nine of us went out, old friends of ours we said hang out with, and you came up a lot. We were talking, showing old pictures and talking about old times, Beta Breakers and all this kind of stuff. And, um, we were talking about how like we didn't have a lot of us didn't have two nickels to rub together, but we didn't know any better. And like, I, I remember running",

And like, I, I used my last $0 to buy two beers and get home in a cab. Like, or get halfway home in a cab and then walk, you know, like go as far as when the meter, when the meter like hits 980, I'm like, all right, stop. And I, I just get out. And like, and I've, you know, we've done that before. And so like when I started making a little bit more money, I started realizing that my financial vice was good food and drinks. And when I got into craft cocktails, um, it really hit a crescendo where like, I really won't, I won't shy away from spending a few hundred dollars on dinner with someone like at a really good restaurant, because I don't really spend my money doing anything else.
