So we just have a whole bunch of things, but I'm just going to kind of say them and then we can reflect. We can go off that way. So on January 5th, we left to do this full time. That was a really big deal. That was a full year ago. Right before that, we went down to LA to do a show with Kevin Smith. That's crazy because that really does feel like years ago to me. Yep, 1000%. It's just crazy that I remember we went to that thing and we were just like, we talked to him and we did his show and our show and we were just talking about, yeah, we're doing this, we're leaving, we don't know how it's going to go.

No, I'm fucking around. No, no, no, no. I'm just joking. He's kind of a busy man. Exactly. I think he's busy. Yeah, but it would just be cool. I would tweet at Kevin Smith and let him know that we would love to do a sequel show with him. I wonder if he'd be impressed. You know? I would hope so. Me too. I can't tell you. He's a nice guy. You're doing the thing where, look back at the year, right?

We did two weeks or whatever before we were gone. Gone. No, we did it one week before we were gone. It was like a weekend before. Yeah, I thought we did it in between Christmas and New Year's. It was our literal last days of IGN. Yeah, yeah. I remember it was in the 20s of December after Christmas. But I mean like, Jesus fucking Christ. I'm not on trial, Tim. No sidebar. That was close enough. That was one of the- Sidebar. Kevin Smith made movies and we enjoyed them. Favorite Kevin Smith movie? Go. Go. Clerks. No, Mallrats. Mallrats. Mallrats. Mallrats. Mallrats.

When we were all sleeping, you almost crashed a car. When we all almost fell asleep and like Tim, we just kind of just decided, okay, he's probably okay to drive. And I was. You slept so little. You totally were. I drove that entire way. I know. We're very proud. Back. The entire way back. I drove down. So when Kevin Smith said to us at the time, remember in the dark times, just like, and he's like, this is from my own experience.

That was honestly the best way to leave because we were so not scared, but like so nervous and just excited of what was going to happen and to have a legend like that. I believe in you guys. This is cool and interesting. And then for us to go and then for it to work, it was like, that's kind of, to me, that set the tone and the base to get us where we're at. And it's cool because like, so moving on from that, like the next thing I have on this thing, and it's not quite an order, but we hired Kevin. Like that's crazy.

We'll do shows in the morning. I'll take a nap in the afternoon. And then it was just like, it's time. And then like that first week where I was like, oh shit, there's a lot of emails. Everyone wants to talk to us. This is cool. It'll taper. And it never tapered off.

I mean what's what's so funny is to really think back, you know, this is getting even older than than 2015, but like 2015 kind of cemented a lot of this stuff. Like Kevin, the origin stories of Kevin working here go so far back to him being like him literally driving me here to shoot conversation with Colin. Cause I didn't have a car and it was like super hard for me to get here from my house. Every single time I would beg him. Every single time he was like, let me go with you.

The non bitch work is being is being the shithead in front of the camera that no matter how hard you try we just make fun of you for comedic sake. But that's part of that's one of the reasons why this is going to sound bad but I'll put it in context after this. One of the reasons why I liked doing this as opposed to what I liked doing at IGN cause it was a thankless job. You worked so fucking hard and no one knew what you were doing. Yeah. Especially if you're on video production and you would stay up all night to cut something really really fucking cool and there's no credits. So no one really gave a shit if you did that awesome.

And to me it was like I want to just I wanted to Explain when you're older. Because it involves you know don't worry about it. I wanted to just come like out of it.

And my dad was like he's like you've always been like this. And in terms of like you've always just been you never believed in yourself about things but you've always succeeded in the things that you've done or at least you've tried.

And it's what what makes me proud about what I do with Greg is that when you count 110 episodes of this show the 50 or so we've done of Gamescast 300 episodes or so we did together a Podcast Beyond a hundred PlayStation conversations all the other miscellaneous videos we did.

It's like, dude, like, like, why don't you speak? Halo 5 still doesn't have a release date. No, let's see if anyone bought it anyway. But it's one of those things where you look at it and you're like, dude, like I understand your criticisms, but maybe be a little more kind about it because I can put you in front of a camera for 15 hours a week and we'll see how well you do.
