Recently on another one of your shows, I apologize for getting which one at the moment I can barely give him stra on youtube.com kinda funny games. Colin recounted his list of games for 2015. This of course was the Games Cast. In this list contained a small title called 34s Home, a great title on PSN that cost less than $10. With all the AAA titles for 2016 slated for release on PlayStation 4, how do you all see the landscape for smaller PSN titles shaping up for 2016? Are there any smaller titles or quote unquote Indie Games you're looking forward to this year other than Firewatch PS? Colin, your position, do you want",
