            "text": "topic comes from Patreon. Hey, Michael Wayne says Colin, Greg, and Tim have stated many times they're not really fans of online gaming. That's us. Why is this? Do you just hate dealing with lag issues? Is it a consistent gameplay experience problem? Trust me, I know how frustrating online gaming is, and I can understand the allure of dodging the headache altogether. In recent times, I too have thought to myself, you know what? I'm about done with online gaming, even though I'm not entirely sure that's a reasonable thing to say given where the industry is and where it's going. All my favorite games are from the 90s, and more and more I feel like the magic that was, that was online gaming a decade or so ago, has all but entirely lost its luster. I'm still thoroughly enjoying online co-op stuff, but the play over spire stuff, even though I'm good at it, is always full of inconsistent in migraine inducing experiences, so it has become a huge turnoff for me. You'd think you'd be all over it with the",

You'd think you'd be all over it with the internet connections you guys get out there. We just got 15 down, one up here in Maine just a couple years ago. It's terrible now. How long it takes to upload a 50-megabyte YouTube video? About 50 minutes. Jesus. Oh, sorry. So sorry. This is no way to live. Get out of Maine. Important. Yeah, but what part of Maine? I don't believe that that's all. After all, Island, you must live in like Presque Isle or something like that. Together anyway. Anyways, I think the online gaming discussion would be a great topic for an episode. You guys mentioned it often enough but haven't really gone into detail about your thoughts on it yet. Mm-hmm. I thought this was interesting as well. It is a good time. I think that we all don't do it for different reasons. Sure, I'd like to start with you, Colin. Well, I think he's totally missed",

Well, I think he's totally missed the point of why I'm not in the online game. You hate the LAN. I think that we're all kind of, maybe not all consistent. I think, I, I think you guys play online more, especially Greg, more than, way more than I do. Um, I just don't want to. I'd it's not what I said before. I don't play games for these reasons. Now, there are some games that I've definitely enjoyed online. I've often brought up the example of Rainbow Six 3, which I played for hundreds of hours online when I was in college on Xbox, the original Xbox. I love that game. It's scratched in a specific itch. When The Last of Us came out more recently in 2013, I played it for about 40 or 50 hours online. I was doing it for the trophies because the trophies are obnoxious online, but then I realized that I actually really enjoyed playing it, but",

I was doing it for the trophies because the trophies are obnoxious online, but then I realized that I actually really enjoyed playing it. But there comes a point where when you play a video game against an AI, the difficulty is not necessarily consistent, but it's predictable. So when the difficulty ramps up, you know that it's kind of always gonna be the same. And when you want to play a game online, come sort of competitive way, and I'm not saying like professionally, but like you want to have fun by being, you know, decent at it, at least having an even kill-death ratio or whatever, you have to stay consistent with it or you're just not going to be very good at it. And we saw this over and over again at IGN when we'd have to review the online portions of games. We would do that in test and what they would call test environments because the game wasn't out yet, and I'd be pretty good at some of these games, and then I'd go back a week",

I'd be getting my ass kicked. And that's my own fault. I'm not saying that that's something wrong with the game. It's not. It's to say that I would, if I want to play Battlefront, for instance, and actually enjoy myself, I'd have to only play Battlefront for a long period of time because the, the, the scaling difficulty is based on the entire community having played the game extensively. So there's just a lack of balance there in terms of the way out what I'm looking for in games. I want to go into a gaming experience and just play at my own pace. I think I'm a pretty good gamer in specific genres, and I like playing those games and challenging myself at those games, and also challenging myself of things that I'm not very good at. But I don't want to like base it based on the way",

I just play games to be by myself, to have fun by myself, to unwind by myself. I don't want to talk to anyone when I'm playing a game. I don't want to know anyone with me when I'm playing a game. It's the same when I was making Borderlands some time ago. I forgot to shut my, um, my, see, like my matchmaking thing off, so people would kept joining my games and just kept kicking him out. And I felt bad because I'm just like, I, and then I, you know, shut it off, but I was like, is not this some people? Borderlands is running around with three friends.

To me, Borderlands is not running around with anyone. Yeah, and that's the way I want to play it. And I think the big litmus test for me is going to be The Division because there's so much ebb and flow in terms of the way they talk about the game, and they promised on Twitter, or Greg and I got like, I literally got like scores of people telling me like, oh, they just said that you can play it by yourself and all the kinds of, but then they say, you will die alone in the trailer. And I'm wondering is if, if you play alone, you'll die alone, or if you're gonna die alone, I guess it like some sort of fellow. Like, I don't, you know, I don't like, I don't, you know, I don't, yeah, we're all die alone. That's true. So thank you, The Division.

And I don't think there's a game that I played online to any extent without, and except for getting trophies for it, like the reason we're getting trophies since The Last of Us. I think that was the last game I've spent any more than two hours online. You know, I played Far Cry 3 online with some, some IGN fans at the time just to get the trophies, you know, and dabbled with some other online game too. But I've never been interested in playing online because that's just not what I'm looking for. And I played games even when I was a kid, and we only had a local co-op or competing a local cooperative or competitive co-op. I wasn't interested in playing it like that either. Like I wanted to be alone. Mmm. Yeah, that's so that's, that's my stance. Great. Uh,",

And I feel even when online was coming on strong, you know what I mean? Like I would go back to the fact of like, you know, when I write a review, when I talk to you, the best friends, when I do all this stuff, and where even the best friends come from, right? The terminology is the fact that when I'm talking about a game, I'm talking about games the way I used to talk to Poe about games in the basement of my house with all my friends, where my group of friends, I was the gamer. They enjoyed games. They maybe one or two of them had a system. Then it probably wasn't current, you know what I mean? But they didn't love games like I did. So I was that guy.

So I grew up isolated in that way where it was you go to GameStop and you be, be, you know, a funkle and and be blown away to talk to people there or the attendant there, the clerk there, to talk about games in like express what you read in EGM and try to have these conversations, right? And so even when Poe finally bought a PS2 and brought it home, we bought that SOCOM adapter, right? And we wanted to play SOCOM, and it wasn't, it didn't work out. Everything obviously, they can actually sucked. Yeah, and the other one wasn't a fun game for us, for us. And you know, we went back to just playing, you know, we each have our football game and then come over and do these things or whatever, hang out. You figure I go to college, right? And PlayStation 2, you know, I go to college with my PlayStation 2 in 2001, stuff, and I missed the train with",

And PlayStation 2, you know, I go to college with my PlayStation 2 in 2001, stuff, and I missed the train with Xbox, the original Xbox. Didn't have any money to get one at first. So Halo's becoming this thing over there, and it's not, I have a couple friends in there, but even in college, I was like, I was the gamer guy. You know, my best friend in college, Hayes, had, you know, bought a GameCube right away, and we went and played local stuff. But at no point was online becoming a thing where that was. And even when you jump to when Xbox 360 and then PlayStation 3 come out, and PlayStation 3 comes out a couple months before I get outed at IGN, you know, I didn't go out of my way to buy either of those because I didn't have Ethernet. And I'd only thing I had, I might not even had at my first apartment after college, internet period. But I didn't have Ethernet for sure, and I didn't have an HDTV. And so like these things were",

And so like these things were happening this slow. By the time I got to IGN, I have all the stuff. I'm ready to go online. Multiplayer is the thing. I already feel like I've missed the boat. Yeah, so many people have, you know, Vegas, or the Rainbow Six Vegas stories and all this other stuff and done other than like they had done this, that and the other. And I'm not playing on Xbox 360, right? Because I didn't own my own Xbox 360. Second, afford it. And then nobody's playing on PS3. So when I bring home a PS3, nothing to really play online, let alone it's not something that's normal to me or, yeah, it makes sense to me. And so then as time goes on and it becomes more and more, it's just not something that's there for me. It's not, we not, I mean, like there are the rare exceptions, right? Like Borderlands is a co-op game for me, you know what I mean? And",

What, what Borderlands co-op is, is either when it will Mike, Mike lived here, me and Mike in the living room on two TVs, or when for Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Christine and I either yelling down the hall to each other while we're playing on the internet, or me on the second screen in the bedroom playing there, you know, us having a conversation while we play. Like that local co-op became more important. And so there's again, the most notable exception, of course, is DC Universe Online, where, you know, I sink whatever, 550 hours, 600 hours into that game or whatever. And a lot of that is with other people. But even then, for me, it calls out all the problems that I'm, I don't, I don't like about online multiplayer of, all right, well, we need these people to raid, but I'm",

You're out there screaming for not even DPS, DPS. We're all looking for a tank. You looking for Hugh shouting, shouting, shouting, 'cause you have a group friends, wouldn't you need one other person to get in there, right? And then you get in there, something disconnects, and it's all, and you wait around for something to happen. Or I'm the Rando, and I join a random group, and they get mad at how I'm DPSing. I'm not playing. Why did, why am I using this load? I want, want because how I want to play. Like, you don't mean when I'm playing a single-player game, no one's there. Well, why are you doing this? And why don't you do this? You don't know. But I'm like, no, I just want to play this game at my pace. Like you're talking about, I want to experience the way I want to do it. And so then it",

Like you're talking about, I want to experience the way I want to do it. And so then it becomes there's this other wrinkle to it that Colin already calls out of just like, even when there's something I like online, like, you know, like Killzone is the shooter that I put the most time in online, right? But it was because I went home every night and played online with retail servers. Went, went. And then there was, you take that week break and you come back and you're garbage, and everyone's beating the living out of you, and it's not fun. Yeah, I mean, and that, that was like, all right, Destiny was a similar thing of like, I was enjoying Destiny when it first came out. Then I went away for a weekend or whatever. Everybody was raiding. When I got back, I was way behind. People like, I'll pull you through. And it's like, that's not fun. That's not what I don't want that. You know what I mean? Like, I know",

You know what I mean? Like, I know that's not the experience I want. And so it, I, I don't, all right, what excites me about The Division is the idea of there being a single-player content that I'm doing. And then if I want, I can go do it. And I know you do that with Destiny, but Destiny, I mean, shooters are rare for me to connect with. I like Destiny, but it's a big commitment to get back into. And it's always how much time do you have? You know what I mean? Like when I do jump on a Destiny, I start getting requests from people to play with. It's like, I'm only gonna be here for 15 minutes. It's not worth jumping into this, trying to figure out that. I just want to go through and run these missions. You know, I want to go do this one thing because I've done it where you jump in and it's like all this stuff, and I just end up quitting. And you know,",

Whereas with single-player, you know how you never know how long it's gonna go. Yeah, for me, it's, it's a lot, a mix of all that stuff. I think the time sink is the biggest thing. Just the fact that I like games to be tied experiences where it's like, I know this is 13 hours, and oh, this is eight hours, and oh, yeah, it's 5 hours, whatever it is. Or, you know, a Final Fantasy, more like 40 hours or whatever. Like, I like knowing that. And with these, it's that time never ends. Yeah, I do a lot of people. That's awesome. And I will say that I think that that the pinnacle of, and the enjoyment of a video game is if you have that squad of people and you're all playing that game together.

And yeah, because I've seen Alfredo do it so many times with all of the first-person shooters throughout the years, from Counter-Strike all the way through all the Halo's and all that. Like seeing him play and seeing that work and him doing call-outs and stuff and everyone knowing exactly and everyone just being on that same, same wavelength. And doesn't even need to be MLG pro gaming. Like just competitively playing and like whenever you're playing is people that are competitive and it's all good.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, music games like Amplitude and stuff like that. Back in the day, DDR on the Xbox had online mode that was all just like leaderboard stuff, or there'd just be other skaters around. And at the end of the day, it was just a leaderboard just there happening with someone else in that, yeah, thing or doing like graffiti in Tony Hawk and stuff like that. Like, but that it's simple. I think that's what it comes down to is you can get good at that, sure, but you don't need other people involved, and you're never gonna be that good at it. And if you are, that's weird.

And I think that's where my online gaming ends is I don't need something that I'm going back to forever because I don't have that, right? I don't have forever to give. Sometimes I don't have it. I don't wish to spend my time that way. No, I, that's similar with me, right? Like games for me are like books or TV shows or whatever, where there's a beginning, middle, and an end. You know what I mean? It's like, I like getting the credits. That was fun. Maybe go back and pick something up, but then I'm like moving on.

Okay, where do I get? You know what I mean? Oh, yeah, it's a lot like for me to TV seasons where it's like, I want to know or anime is actually even better example.

I knew I could never get that, but seeing them trying to get it made me want to play with them because I was good at capture the flag. I can't shoot for, but I can capture that goddamn flag. So it's like, I would play with them and do that.

And I think that there's a certain level of like excitement and just achievement that comes with that of just like, where we want to do this. And Smash Bros. is the same way.

I like multiplayer Nintendo games. Those are the multiplayer games that I like. I'm decent at them. They're fun. And if I lose, I don't care 'cause it was fun. Yeah, you know? And uh, we've been taught about Battlefront a lot. Like I have fun with that, but at the same time, I'm not good at it. Yeah, not nearly good. And for someone that's been out of it so long, it is just foreign language completely. Like even getting in online gaming, like you need to know a lot. And that's coming from somebody that knows games. But like if you don't play that stuff, you just don't know. It's like I'm someone that doesn't know JRPGs talking about Mana.

Then I'll jump in here and there, but it'll never be my thing. And I just, I don't get enjoyment from it. It's still to the point, I mean, one point I guess I left out is that I still feel like I don't have, my friends aren't doing it. You know what I mean? Like when I made Alfredo teach me to be a first-person shooter aficionado for Titanfall, right? Like him and I would play, but like we're not like super Bros. You know what I mean? It's like Scott Lowe would dip in and dip out. You know what I mean? It's like, but none of you guys are, and none of the close circle is. And yeah, well, why would I? You know what I mean?
