I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty, go Islanders! Producer Nick Scarpino, go Islanders! Fe one Tim Gettys, go Islanders! Go Islanders indeed, ladies and gentlemen. If you didn't know, and this looks different, we're going to about to play this game called Pie in the Face. The reason we're playing Pie in the Face is because we are raising money over on Patreon.com/KindaFunny for the Kinda Funny: The Animated Series. We're doing it the entire month of January. We're trying to raise $75,000 so we can make 10 episodes of the animated show. So please go there because every dollar raised in January goes towards Kinda Funny: The Animated Series doing 10 episodes for the entire year. If you want to donate just for, I mean, you know, January you donate, right? February they take your money. February, as soon as your money's are on, dial us back to a dollar, delete your pledge.",

February, as soon as your money's are on, dial us back to a dollar, delete your pledge, whatever. Every dollar helps. If everybody who gave us $1 would give us $5, we would be done. Yeah. So all time, basically on the Twitch stream, which people are watching right now, but you're in the time loop of YouTube, uh, we did this thing where we have mini goals to get to the big milestones of the episodes. One of them was to play Pie Face. Tim, are you familiar with Pie Face? I, I am only familiar because you showed me YouTube videos of people playing it. Okay, so the way Pie Face works in like this YouTube video is that we will all go around Russian Roulette style. You will hit this thing and spin it, right? Just like you do in Russian Roulette, just like you Russian Roulette with a little cute thing, cute little pin. Then you bring this guy over, which will be loaded, loaded with whipped cream, and then you click it.",

Somebody else spins. There's whipped cream on this. Yeah. Last man standing without any crap in their face is the winner. Now, Kevin, can you do, can you do a zoom for me real quick on the camera? We do it after. Yeah. I, I want to show you something. The terror in this boy's face. Look at the terror in that young boy. That's going to be us real soon. So, I mean, I, we did a dry run of this and it's **** terrifying. Yeah, it gets right in your face. I'm surprised, I'm that surprised.

Colin, you're just about to suck the whipped cream for. Yeah, you got a problem with that? No. Five, two, four, four. So goes first and then we'll go clockwise, I guess. Okay, okay. Do you want me to load it for you? Load it up. You got to do, does he have to spin again or no, to see how many times? Now you have to spin to see how many. It's been reset, right? It's been reset.

Oh, yeah, no, I got to, I'm used to this. This is a little weird to play Russian Roulette with, uh, a spin wheel, don't you think? We're doing, you should all click once. Oh, and we're doing last man standing, right? Yeah. Okay, so you get hit with the pie. You five. Oh, **** me in the ass. Good luck with this. That's what most kids say when they play Pie Face.

What, what do you want? Do you want my glasses on or off? I clean glasses afterward. Okay, I don't care if my glasses get there. All right. Oh, I'll angle myself 'cause I'm clearly going to get hit. Remember, Kevin, I did this 'cause I love you. You did this 'cause you're an attention ****. One. God, I didn't even do it. Scary. One. What is this teaching children? Two. Oh, Jesus Christ. Three. No way. Four. See, it's not dramatic enough. I need it to be more. I need it to be more dramatic. You want to put the, you want to put a bigger spring in there? I just don't.

But it kept it from like dropping that whipped cream on the ground. It's true. It is a splash guard. Greg, what? I don't care. I was, I'm already out. I don't put the splash guard back in. I don't think we need it that dramatic, do we, Colin? You want it? No, no, no, it's fun. It's funny with the face. All right, I'm going to, but I just need more of them. Yeah, no, I get that. I mean, you want to get, you want to see somebody get popped in the face. We can have Kevin add a sound effect. Kevin, we're going to need more paper.

Thank you. All right, let me get you a little bit more here. All right, let's see. Do we leave it on our face or we take it off? Leave it. Oh, okay. I think you take it off. Five. Jesus, game's rigged. So what do I do? The game is rigged. I just turn this. You just put your face in first. Bernie Sanders said turn it. Bernie Sanders specifically said the game is rigged. One.

Well, we didn't put, we put the hand, we could flip the hand around, but it's not, but it's, I don't think that's not how it's meant to be. If you look at it in the pictures here, you can't really tell. Look at the kid, look at the kid with it. It looks, yeah, it's a flat hand though in the picture. Yeah, that's a different hand. Clearly a different hand. It's totally a different hand. We could take it up and us because now it's the last man standing. It's between Colin and I. So we could flip it around and just load that **** if you want. I want to ratchet up the **** pressure. But I'll be honest, I don't know, you want me to do?

Oh, yeah, that's stuff. Big nipple on it. Little nipple, little nipple. Stigmata. Little nipple. All right, it's my turn. Feels very D-Boy Stigmata. Put mayonnaise on it, which is actually great. That's disgusting. Remember when you made that wrestler eat mayonnaise? But wait a minute, if it's just between you and me, it comes back to me first, does it? He hasn't gone yet. Oh, you haven't gone yet. No, wait, shouldn't have. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you're right. I was thinking counterclockwise. I apologize. Three in the B. Son of a **** must pay.

I'm teed and ah, it looks like you sunblock like you play volleyball in the 80s. Nick, lick me. He's doing it. Oh, God, like him. All, I'm not against him. That's ridiculous. That was it. That was the line. Try the lineup looking two men in one day. I'm not a **** for whipped cream. I just feel like someone said so much buildup in a weak finish. And I actually kind of agree.

That kid, that terror in that kid's face is only the terror shown if NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory first engineered this thing to shoot it at like, you know, 150. He was the test case. And after he died, they, they cranked it down about 30 notches. Well, there you go. That's pie. But this was, but this was my complaint about it, um, when I was saw like, when I saw the videos too. People keep saying it's backwards. It is categorically not backwards. Um, yeah, the empty one with all like the engineering spec things on the back, not what you're supposed to see.
