Leo said I wanted some drugs. Uh, I start, I would say about smoking drugs, go back man, school, you smoke a couple drugs. Yeah, I watch more movies. Okay, I recite, I'm gonna watch movies and I'm chronicling on my notepad on the phone every movie I watch this year. Okay, I have a good list going so far. Things like these I've watched, this is done, this isn't looking forward, it's looking back, you know. Yeah, give me the list so far and I put them in parentheses and where I saw them in information I need to know. All right, great. So Sleeping With Other People, Amazon. Okay, Straight Outta Compton, Amazon, great. The Visit, Amazon, Propaganda Wars, Netflix, The Intern, Amazon, Goodfellas and I put in there repeat.

But here's the thing is like I feel like every time I go to the movies I sit down on mic, I enjoy the movies. I should come into movies more and I want to do that more - that's what I've decided. If I don't weekend's, if I don't have a game to play cuz you know how am I going to play, I want to go out Sunday morning, go to the movies, right? I you know, I love that Sunday morning matinee. It's gone. Finnegan will always be down. John Finger will always always Tuesday my favorite zombie movie and Lex Luthor Michael Rosenbaum favorite zombie movies playing up here in San Francisco at the Alamo Drafthouse.
