Life is Strange, hmm, caveat, it did come earlier, I just didn't play it till this break. Life is Strange, I heard so many good things about. I had played Episode 1 upon release not knowing much about it, so when you got to like some of the twists at the end and stuff, I was like, this is weird and I don't know how I feel about it. And so then just by happenstance, all the other episodes piled up this break. I sat down and played through them all and blown away. Such a great game, so much fun. Love the story, love the characters, love the world, just this little seaside town or whatever. And again, I don't, it's one of those, I don't want to go in and knock off one of these games that I've thought about to put it in there, so it has to be an",

A lot of people who recommended me to play. Oh, you dig it? Yeah, you would dig it a lot. I hear you say hello a lot. They do say hello a lot. Closes hello a lot. I'm gonna do it. Your big hello fame. I am. Alright, cool. So play Life is Strange, everybody. That's getting a disc-based released in the coop in the new year anyway, so you get there. Ah, next honorable mention, alphabetical order, of course. Taco **** Master. Lord Greg, you're unstoppable. I don't, he can put here as a loo down there. Nobody gives him ****. Another iOS game, just poured it over that super simple and doesn't mean much. Taco Master, fun, three bucks, a platinum in an afternoon. What else could I want out of a guy for the Vita? Something I can because I, you know what I did with it?",

Going with the right expectations, you're gonna have fun with Taco Master. Greg Miller's honorable mention number two of the year. Did you make it hit the charts? We don't know yet. Okay, I, I have a feeling when the chit, when they release digital sales on the PSN of what charted for the month, Taco Master should be on there for the Vita games. And it's gonna be a thousand percent because of us. Because if you didn't know, he, you take some credit for that. Because of me. And if you didn't know, it's because everyone who owns a Vita and wants to play video games watches Kinda Funny.

Mmm, I'm trying to get a copy right now and even then I'm gonna be behind on it, but that's supposed to be really good too. So we keep your eye on that one. And then third honorable mention, Witcher 3. Mmm, Witcher 3 this year. I really, I was, you know, in the mood. Oh, we hit 45, 45. Everybody been hit $45,000 on Patreon.com/KindaFunny. Thank you very much. Twitch people are watching this live.

I was like, yes, that sounds so awesome. I want an open-world to get lost in and take quests and wander around and do all these different things in. And Witcher 3 came in the summer before we got that, before we got Batman. And I saw it and the more I heard about it and saw a video as far, I was like, I don't like fantasy. It's just not my thing. I don't like magic. I don't like medieval times kind of crap. You know what I mean? But it looked fun and I got it, played it for 25, 30 hours and I had a great time with it. And it's weird because now that I'm starting to knock things off my, you know, list, my backlog now, or at least I just feel myself being a bit drawn back to it.

And what I've never, Twitter, yeah, we're sure over and over again. What I'd never heard her talk about and she talked about the video was the fact that yeah, Act One does go on too long, but Act Two and Three pick up and get crazy and that's really where it is. And oh well, ****, I never, I got out Act One or whatever. You know what I mean? I was gonna run. I'd like to see why so many people when we say now my game, you're freaked out about it. So many people lose their **** and say it's the best and I've put hundreds hours in it and I beat it. I couldn't believe the ending though.

So now we're into top 10 alphabetical order. That means Batman: Arkham Knight's at the top of the list. Now what I find interesting about Batman: Arkham Knight is when I talk about it and when we've talked about it before and doubt, uh, I always feel like I talk about the negatives first. You know what I mean? I don't like the Bat, I don't like the tank. I didn't like, I didn't like **** strafing around shooting 43 things out of the sky and these guys shooting missiles at me and all that dumb ****. You know, I didn't like the fact that they can I say wide, but I say in a joking way that, you know, they said it all, Arkham Knight's character of our own creation and then it wasn't.

Batman: Arkham Origins was set up as this is a game about Black Mask hiring all these people. You're like, that sounds pretty cool. And you played Arkham Origins and I think it was in the first hour, but maybe the first hour and a half where it's like, aha, no, it's not. I'm the Joker and this is the Joker's origin story. And you were like, holy ****, that was like, whoa, yes, yes, a million times. You played through and it was awesome. It doesn't get enough credit as game or Batman Joker story because it's amazing. Arkham Knight went the opposite way of like, we think this guy's a new guy, but he's not. And they did that seven or eight hours in or whatever the hell it was and I'd figured it out at hour two.",

And part of that is the fact that Batman games are good, great, or great games or whatever you wanted to call them, right there. Everybody, like most everybody, not Colin. Oh, you know, it's like the combat. Usually most everybody likes Batman. They're positive. But at the third one, what, you know what I mean? What are we? There's only so much left of the good stuff to say. Like the expectations start getting so high. You get into Uncharted 3 situation where, you know, no matter what, it's the negatives that are gonna stand out. But I, I mean, I loved the gameplay. I loved the world. Beautiful. The story is good.

The one thing I always, I love about Rocksteady and I don't know if I'll forget it again, but I feel like with every one of the Batman games they did and their Arkham Trilogy is the fact that you play it and it's just a regular Batman game for so long. And then there's always something, some crazy thing they do where like, you know, in the, in Arkham Asylum, right? Where you all of a sudden start walking around as Bruce Wayne. You know what I mean? After his parents get shot and your baby Bruce Wayne or whatever. Or, you know, then in Arkham City, you get dropped into Mad Hatter's thing and it's all twisted around. It's like for so long, it's just been I'm running around fighting criminals. And all of a sudden now I'm in this weird world of the Scarecrow emissions race having the ground and stuff.

I also, as always, I'm one of the few people I ever see defending the season pass in their DLC. I bought the season pass originally, beginning it delivered what my expectations were for it. You know what I mean? If not even a little bit more. And the fact that I bought it because I decided for Batgirl's mission, they said they're gonna do some character missions and then some stuff at the end. I was waiting for all that. But lo and behold, I found myself every time I jump in to play Nightwing's 20 or 30 minute mission or whatever the hell it was. I'd beat that and then I'd got be alright.

No, no, that's silver isn't that hard to get. I should try. And I have all those trophies now. You know what I mean? I looked at my game clock and it was something like I platinumed Arkham Knight, then did all the DLC trophies. And before I got, I probably put like 75 or 80 hours in Arkham Knight according to it. You know what I mean? Maybe, you know, 70 to 80, we'll say somewhere in there based on the fact that I think it was 64 before I really launched into the DLC every week. And that's preposterous. I did not expect that when we were talking about Arkham Knight, when we were looking into Arkham Knight ahead of time. You know what I mean?

Like Witcher is one of those ones. I don't know if I'll ever get to the content. The Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, I did the same thing. Don't if I ever really get to that content. And here I did. Now it's cool. Next one on my list of my real top 10, number two, but not ordered alphabetical. Emily Is Away. We've already talked about it. You hit the nail on the head. Like that game, I talk about, you know, when I talk about that game and write about that game, what I say is like, we sat down to play this game and it turned out that it was a time machine.

I'd find funny things and cut him out and then tape him to my desk. And I had my giant Toshiba laptop here and my window out to the wall in front of Hatch Dormitory. And I am there talking to my high school friends and misconnection high school girls where it was like, you know what I mean? Like we, I didn't know what I was doing. They didn't know they're doing. You a lot of subs. Sue, exactly. Yeah, yeah.

I know it's early 2000, but for me, I'm back in 2001, right where they had the Blink-182 Take Off Your Pants and Jacket like album cover as a buddy icon. And I so distinctly remember seeing them at the Warped Tour and having that album and cut in my freshman year roommate that was a sign of me through Mizzou by being, oh, I like Blink-182. Oh, you have that one. I have this version. You're like talking about that. No, somebody talked about, you know, anything like that's a really good point. It's not only did they nail the the AIM aspects of it in the Buddy icons. Yes, it's tough. It's like the time machine thing of having the icons. Like you didn't choose your icon.

And we had fun looking at him and being like, all right, this is M&M. This is, you know, Black Eyed Peas. This is what is that? What is like, oh yeah, sure. I'm like, that's cool. You know, like that they nailed it. And they nailed a way where it's like, you the game just made you think differently. Made you think like, wow, okay, what, what was happening? Yeah, you know, like what did my iPod look like? Yeah, yeah. And that's the thing. I, you know, we on our sister podcast, The GameOverGreggy, we've talked about nostalgia a lot. You know what I mean?

With this girl where it's like, we don't want to pick wrong because we're not trying like the way the whole thing. You know, it's just amazing, amazing. Ah, next on my list of top 10, Fallout 4. Fallout 4 for me, you know, I think the most telling conversation we had about it was leading into the Gamescast when you're talking to Colin and I about it before we had it.

And for it to be amazing, it'll do something I'm not prepared for. And I don't know. And that's what will blow me away with it, right? And now looking back at Fallout 4, having the platinum trophy, being excited for the DLC. It did the first thing. It just was a souped-up version of Fallout 3, which is great. You know what I mean? Like that's not a knock on it. It just never jumped to this thing where I was like, oh my god, I can't. You know what I mean? It added the base building stuff, which I hate, which I think is poorly executed and wasn't fun. And I didn't really put any time into it until I needed the trophy.

There was no draw to go do base building until you needed that trophy. And like that sucked. You know what I mean? And it sucked not being able to make things the way you really wanted them to look or line up walls. I remember when I started doing it, like the walls aren't snapping to corners the right way. So you have these janky houses. And I'd complain about it online. People like, well, it's post-apocalyptic. I'm like, I get that, but like, it's not what I want right now. You know what I mean?

It's such a great time with that. You know what I mean? That's why it's there. And that's why I love it. But it really is like, it's more Fallout 3. And that's great. And that's what I wanted. But I always feel like when I talk about it, it's like, oh yeah, it's what you expected. You know what I mean? Mm. We knew who they were. We let them off the hook. You want to crown its ass?

It's so much fun. And it's, it strikes me in the same vein as Rocket League where you can take the controller and you can play it and you can jump in it. You can have a great time.

And it's because I'm a big Lego game fan, period. But when they did that trailer that was like, we're getting into, you know, the toys of life genre or whatever. I was like, okay, cool.

You just watch me cut it off early. I was like, well, alright, I'm in. You know what I mean? And at Comic-Con, I finally got to play it and see it in action. And I was like, oh, it's the Lego games. You know what I mean? And I remember getting the demo. The guys like, well, what did you think it was gonna be? And I'm like, I don't know. Like Disney Infinity, other toys life stuff. Disney Infinity is fine, but it's very basic and it's running around. It's doing this. And like, I didn't expect it was going to be that you're taking the Lego games of different genres, shoving them together and then giving me minifigs. I was like, oh, that's cool. And I was alright.

And they start from the beginning and they're like, alright. And now like they, you know, faked it for because we were doing a stream. But like they pulled up the thing. I'm like, otherwise you'd have to go through. So I'm like, wait, you build the toys while you're playing the game? And they're like, yeah. And then I was like watching like we're in the Back to the Future level. And it's got like the Out-of-Time logo and that.
