We're prank calling our friends. Yay! It's going to be a good old time. We're doing this in support of Patreon.com/KindaFunny, trying to make the Animated Series a reality, a full one episode season. It's going to be good, good old time. Colin, mhm, we got you. You were the pro, you're the prank call King, self-proclaimed in the late '90s. We, I, Ebaum's World had the great, you know, soundboard set up. We used to prank call our friends and their parents and all that kind of stuff. So you're currently on Ebaum's World for the first time in, since the 15 years probably, and we're going to call some of our friends and we're going to see how this goes. Okay, it's going to be fun. Greg, yeah, you ready? You got a guy number one all all lined up? Yeah, can I be here? Is this okay? Is this not in the way for you? That's fine. Okay, your call has been, God damn it, what a ****.

Hold. I can I can get the number lined up. How many people are watching us do this right now? 5,670. Like these idiots are calling their friends and this one's at work. He's not going to answer. He might. All right, you ready? Can't do much. Your call cannot be completed as he probably has a block on *69. Oh, *69. Wait, just call from Colin's phone. Yeah, that's why no one's going, no one picks up unless they the number actually comes through. That's what I tried to say and then every no, that's what I was saying too. That's",
