I was like wow. All right. It's a funny world that we live in. So we're going to start this off big. We're talking big games of 2016 so I have this whole list of games. We're just going to kind of talk about them and you know just just just touch. Just talk about them. Just see see how big we think they're going to be and all of that.

Mainly these are multi-platform games because the topics coming up are going to be focused on the platforms. You got your PlayStation, you got your Xbox. So let's start off with a little game called Doom. Yes. Okay. Had a big had its big reveal in 2015 that alpha has been going on. Do we think this is going to be a thing? What do you define as a thing? I don't know. I think it'll be a thing. I don't think it's going to be like one of the best selling games of the year. I think it's going to be a big deal when it comes out. I think it's definitely gonna be one that a lot of people are going to be playing talking tweeting about. I'm excited for it for the more single player focused first person shooter. Also it's Doom. How can you not get excited about Doom? It is like the old Dooms. I liked I liked Doom 3 a lot",

I remember that was one of those games where you you take your friend to Best Buy and you go to the demo kiosk cause it had everything on like ultra settings on the PC and you're like holy shit sure. Yeah. Doom 1 and 2 were big or seminal games for me in terms of like that was my first foray into PC gaming that like really like I guess not hardcore but like you know real PC gaming in man. Did I fucking hate it? Cause I remember being awake till one in the morning trying to get drivers installed and I'm not making this up and then but finally finally getting it to run and after going into my parents' computer and fucking around with all these background settings not knowing I was doing it but finally getting it",

So to have it come back and be something that I think is going to be a big deal. I don't know how great the game will be on these other things but it will be a big deal when it comes out. I'm excited to see it. Yeah. It's it's funny that you gave you gave a look when I said Doom 3 like I was just too young for Doom 1 and 2. Those weren't things that I like. They were way older than me. Then also I had no idea how to use a fucking PC back then but yeah Doom 3 was when I was like cognizant and reading about this game coming out and how good it looked and all this stuff.

So I think that it's you know it's huge that any Doom game would come out and there's a story behind this game too as we often talk about it this very torture development for this game. So I'll be interested to see how it all turns out. I mean Doom is Doom 4 as we thought it was gonna be called has been teased forever. Remember Doom 3 came out in 2004, 2005 maybe. I think it was 2004. So it's been a very long time. It'll be 10 years or so since Doom came out. Is this going to be a big deal? Yeah I think it's gonna be a pretty big deal. I don't I don't think it's going to be a Call of Duty or Battlefield game but I think it's going to be a pretty pretty big deal. How excited are you? You're a big Doom fan. I love Doom. Yeah. Yeah.",

I want to see what it can do. This is a different id and a new id and an id without its leadership or its old leadership. So I'm interested to see like what what do they what do they prioritize now? Rage was the last game they released and and you know they prioritize fidelity I think over substance. Well sometimes with or they're known to do that with some of their games the Carmack's kind of obsession with that shit.

And everyone should read Masters of Doom as a remind you often. Great book. Do you guys think it's going to be a seven, eight or nine type of game? Yeah I would say it's probably right. Yeah. First step out in a long long time. Shake off the rust and see what you got. Cool. Dark Souls 3. No it's gonna be big. The last Dark Souls game. Apparently say the last Dark Souls game that From will do. I don't know if Bandai Namco wants to find another studio to do it. They also I think we're pretty clear that they don't want to do Bloodborne again either. So I think that you know if Sony wants to do Bloodborne they have to find another studio to do that too.

What the fuck is it? Or or or yeah. So it's like like they they don't want to do this shit anymore. I don't really I don't really blame them. You know like God damn them and their success. So so I don't think they want to be known for only one thing only. So I think there's gonna be a big blowout. I think this is going to be like a big a big you know conclusion to their trilogy.

So so yeah I mean I'm excited. The Division is probably like my most anticipated game. I'm stoked. I can't wait to see how it all turns out because that is such a cool idea. You know what I mean? And then like me and Alfredo are going to be out there. We already said that you're all welcome to join us but we do the thing where we don't turn on each other at the end. That's very important. We turn on each other at the end. We throw you out of the group. Alfredo and I've signed this in blood. Good. Okay. My favorite way to sign things with Alfredo. Dead Island 2.

Maybe that game might not ever see the light of day. Oh no. Well not that game but there'll be a Dead Island 2 for sure. Not the one you have in that franchise. No Yager is no no no no no no no no. Tekken 7. Yeah no. So it's a weird thing where I mean Street Fighter I think kind of had its resurgence with 5 and it just kind of kept coming. And Tekken's just always been there. Well Street Fighter has resurged with 4. Sorry. Yes 4. And it's just always kind of but Tekken's just always been there always releasing games whether it's the Tag Tournament or the normal one.

They're doing cool things. We'll see. We'll see what it does. No, Street Fighter versus Tekken of course. Yeah of course. Or Cross Tekken whatever the fuck it's called. No Tekken X Street Fighter. Well it doesn't matter because it's probably not real. Mass Effect Andromeda. Yeah it's gonna be a big one. I think it will come out next year.

You have to if you've played Mass Effect 3 to go to the nearest galaxy and have a story there. But I still believe that it will connect back to this to the original story in some respect. I don't think it will do it immediately but I'm excited. I want to see what they're capable of. And this is without Casey Hudson. This is you know in a world post Mass Effect 3 fallout. Yeah like yeah a game made in a vacuum a game in development for a long time and gestating for a while.

You don't have to have the first 30 minutes of it posted everywhere. I'm like let's just get out there and go. What do you think is the likelihood of that happening? Not high. I don't know. I don't think it is high. I think EA will do it where they'll do a couple of different things and events and reveals next year throughout it. Ghost Recon Wildlands.

Yeah I don't think I haven't thought one fucking second about that game. I don't I mean I don't think that game is coming out this year.

I thought they had a chance to be uh another Dying Light in the beginning of the year hit before the big stuff happened. Here's this really cool thing but now they have a chance to go on and be Arkham Knight where there's like hitting the summer which are three where you hit in this place where not a lot of big games are.

I guess Overwatch is the Blizzard one. Right. So like is that going to be a big deal to to a small group of people? Yes.

And then it's announced they're like ah but is it really that big of a deal? It's hard to say because the original Crackdown it's hard to say though because the original Crackdown came with Halo.

And I think I think people like open world games and Crackdown and the original Crackdown was like a collect-a-thon. I think people thought it was like too much. The second one I think people liked a lot. So I'm interested to see like I mean it was for sure. And it's definitely like a cult classic but I'm interested to see the performance of in the sales of this reboot. Everything I've seen for it I like a lot. You know what I mean?

Cause it's like, that seems like a big deal that you, all these games have these Move controllers and who the hell has the light with the PS4 controller comes back into play. I think too. So it's, you'd think they'd be showing the demo then with a PS4 controller. I think it's just not going to control as well with the PS4 controller. And I think that's why they're not doing it. I, the, the, the Moves got to go away. So like it's got to go, it can't, it can't be a thing anymore. I'm sorry. It's like, it's over. I'm calling it.

Like we're not like, we're not going to be playing in radically different ways yet. We will. So I think they need to emphasize like the traditional kind of bearings of these, of these games. I just think that there's enough morbid curiosity in PS VR that they sell a million, like without games. Like I really believe that. I think especially the price is like really appropriate and I don't know, that's going to be a big thing. If the price is like $199, which I think is like really low, I don't think it's going to be that cheap. I don't see why, like it wouldn't sell very well.

And I mean you know I've for a million times said I love my Wii U. I love all the games that I play on and there's been such great experiences but the problem was there's not enough and there's not enough people buy them and playing and we all know that. But for me I think that the NX like we keep hearing there's going to be some hybrid system and that's what everybody thinks. And I think that's the X stands for crossover. It's a safe assumption.

And at times it's really dry but overall it's like you are getting these things. And if you combine those I think that that does lead to a much stronger lineup at least even just Nintendo games. That means that consistently every month you're getting a game instead of every 3 months. And I think that that's a great start and it'll give people all the different experiences they want. I mean Nintendo even now is pretty good about having the different they have the franchises but you get your Xenoblade if you're an RPG guy and like they do try to make sure that they fill the niches.
