I offered you, tell me what game you want to have your rematch for the title in, and you said I get to pick. Well, clearly I pick. I mean, it's fine, you know, GameCube Toadstool Tour.

Blew my mind the other day when somebody tweeted at me and he was like, dude, I've been listening to the Gamescast for 30 weeks and I just found out you have another show called The GameOverGreggy Show. I was like, wow, all right. It's a funny world that we live in. Um, so we're going to start this off big. We're talking big games of 2016. So I have this whole list of games. We're just going to kind of talk about them and you know, just just just talk about them. Just see how big we think they're going to be and all of that. Mainly these are multiplatform games, okay?

Yes. Okay. How big? Had a big reveal in 2015. That Alpha's been going on. Mhm. Do we think this is going to be a thing? What do you define as a thing? I don't know. I think it'll be a thing. I don't think it's going to be like one of the bestselling games of the year. I think it's going to be a big deal when it comes out. I think it's definitely going to be one that a lot of people are going to be playing, talking, tweeting about. Mhm. I'm excited for it for the more single player focused, sure, first person shooter.

I remember that was one of those games where uh you you take your friend to Best Buy and you go to the the demo kiosk because it had everything on like ultra settings on the PC and you're like, holy ****, sure, need to play this. Yeah, Doom 1 and 2 were big or seminal games for me in terms of like that was my first foray into PC gaming that like really like I guess not hardcore, but like, you know, real PC gaming. And man, did I **** hate it because I remember being awake till 1:00 in the morning trying to get drivers installed. I'm not making this up.

So have it come back and be something that I think is going to be a big deal. I don't know how great the game will be on these other things, but it will be a big deal when it comes out. I'm excited to see it. Yeah, it's it's funny. You gave you gave a look when I said Doom 3. Like I was just too young for Doom 1 and 2. Like those those weren't things that I like they were way older than me then. Also, I had no idea how to use a **** PC back then. But yeah, Doom 3 was when I was like cognizant and reading about this game coming out and how good it looked and all this stuff.

So I think that it's um, you know, it's huge that any Doom game would come out. And there's a story behind this game too, as we often talk about. It's very tortured development for this game. So uh I'll be interested to see yeah, how it all turns out. I mean, Doom is Doom 4, as we thought it was going to be, has been teased forever. Remember Doom 3 came out in 2004, 2005, maybe? I think it was 2004. Um, so it's been a very long time. It'll be 12 years or so since Doom uh came out. Is this game going to be a big deal, Colin? Uh yeah, I think it's going to be a pretty pretty big deal. I don't I don't think it's going to be a Call of Duty or Battlefield game, but I think it's going to be a pretty pretty big deal.

This is a different id and a new id. Um and an id without its leadership or its old leadership. Um so I'm interested to see like what like what what do they what do they prioritize now? Rage was the last game they released. And and uh you know, they prioritize fidelity. Um I think over substance. Well, sometimes with uh or they're known to do that with some of their games with Carmack's kind of obsession with that ****. So um now that he's out of the fold, I'm interested to see like what um what happens with this uh because they're really fascinating studio.

Great book. Do you guys think it's going to be an a seven, eight, or nine type of game? Eight. Yeah, I would say eight is probably right. Yeah, first step out in a long, long time. Shake off the rust and see what you got. Cool. Dark Souls 3. Oh, it's going to be big. Um, the last Dark Souls game. Uh apparently they say the last Dark Souls game that From will do. I don't know if Bandai Namco wants to find another studio to do it. Um they also I think were pretty clear that they don't want to do Bloodborne again either. So I I think that, you know, if Sony wants to do Bloodborne, they have to find another studio to do that too. Uh they want to do something else and people forget what From is capable of. I mean, From did, you know, a lot of really weird **** back in the day and I think they want they.",

What the **** is it? Um Armored Core. Yeah, so it's like uh like they they don't want to do this **** anymore. I I don't really blame I don't really blame, you know, like um goddamn them in their success. So so I I don't think they want to be known for like one thing only. So I think there's going to be a big blowout. I think this is going to be like a big a big, you know, conclusion to their trilogy. Um even though they've done really technically five of them at this point with Demon's Souls and Bloodborne. Uh so yeah, I think Dark Souls series is going to be huge. The Division. **** yeah.

Uh so um so yeah, I'm The Division is probably like my most anticipated game, I would say. I'm stoked. I can't wait to see how it all turns out because that is such a cool idea, you know what I mean? And then like me and Alfredo are going to be out there. We already said that you're all welcome to join us, but we do the thing where we don't turn on each other at the end. That's very important. You turn on each other at the end, we throw you out of the group. Yeah, Alfredo and I've signed this in blood. Good. Okay. My favorite way to sign things with Alfredo. Dead Island. I don't think not even a chance of coming out. Yeah, no, no way. They just scrapped the whole thing. No way. I don't think I don't know if that game maybe that.",

No, Jager is no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Tekken 7. Yeah, I don't care. Yeah, no. So Tekken's a weird thing where I mean, you know, Street Fighter I think kind of had its resurgence with five and then it just kind of kept coming. And Tekken's just always been there. Well, Street Fighter 4, sorry. Yes, four. Um and it it's just always kind of but Tekken's just always been there, always releasing games whether it's the Tag Tournament or the nor. And I feel like it has the hardcore fan base that is small, but they're super stoked about this stuff. And was announced to be a playable character. They're doing cool things. Um we'll see.

Doesn't matter because it's probably not real. Um Mass Effect Andromeda. Woo. Yeah, it's going to be a big one. Um I think it will come out next year and I think that I mean that's what they've probably targeted, but I think it will will come out. Um that game is going to be massive. I think that game is going to be really, really cool. I'm excited to see how it connects to the old Trilogy and I I want to see um what it's all about. You a lot of rumors about what what they're doing. Bring back the Mako is one of the rumors that they're, you know, it's it's a clever kind of thing to get out of the galaxy completely.

I don't think it will do it immediately. But uh I'm excited. I want to see what they what they're capable of. And and this is without Casey Hudson. This is um, you know, in a world post Mass Effect 3 Fallout. Yeah, like yeah, a game made in a vacuum, a game in development for a long time and gestating for a while. So I think there's going to be a lot of expectations on Mass Effect Andromeda, but I think that they'll probably they'll probably meet them. I hope they go I hope they stay quiet about it. I hope it gets a big blowout at E3 similar to Fallout and then it's coming out this fall. You know, this fall. We don't have to or show you or anything. We don't have to do a preview tour.

I don't think E I think is you do. I think EA will do it where they'll do a couple different things and events and reveals next year throughout it. Ghost Recon Wildlands. I feel like that's just that was announced and then nothing. It also feels like it also feels like one of those video game names that came out of a random name generator. Ghost Recon is like Wildlands. Okay. Sure. Why not? Mhm. Yeah, that I haven't followed anything about that since that trailer or the trailer. That's thing.

Like where they'll string that one along for a while. I don't need that game. Yeah, and then South Park: The Fractured But Whole. I hope that when do you think we'll see that? 2017. Yeah, I don't think it's the next year game, but God, I would love to have it. I would love to have it this year. That was last South Park game was so good. Yeah, but I don't think it's this year.

Yeah, I I really want to see more about that game. That's definitely one of the ones I'm looking forward to. The biggest thing I think, you know, that when I think of Yarny, I think of when we got to interview Peter Moore at EA at E3 when he was like, yeah, you know, like we're we're not going to make money on Yarny, but that's the risk or the the benefit of making, you know, yeah, Madden and FIFA that we can go make these cool games too.

Early spring. And now it was supposed to be out 2015. Oh, but originally. And then then got pushed. But then yeah, then it got pushed to the yeah, I'm I'm I'm skeptical right now.

I thought they had a chance to be uh another Dying Light in the beginning of the year. Hit before the big stuff happened. Here's this really cool thing. But now they have a chance to go out and be Arkham Knight where they're's like hitting the summer. Witcher 3 where you hit in this place where not a lot of big games. So let's try to get some funder. Let's try to get some speed behind us. Yeah, Nick's not here right now, but he's stoked. Yeah, is a big those game. No joke. That'll be the one game he plays next year.

And when those Alpha codes and or I think it was the Alpha or the Beta went off, people people were going nuts. People were going nuts. So the people that played it **** loved it. And that's the thing is like there's a big group there that is going to be when that hits, they'll be all over it. And we'll see if that then expands to make it a big deal to bigger big bigger people, bigger people like myself, to a bigger group of people.

I think people need to play and then we'll know more about it. But is it going to be super successful? No, I don't think so.
