It was one of those few instances in my restaurant going, you know, in San Francisco, you always go to a restaurant and it's always- there's always something interesting about it. Where you're like, it's good food, but the service is like, they pretend like you just don't even exist sometimes. Or more often than not, when I go to restaurants in San Francisco, it's not like I'm pretending, it's just they act like you're- you're putting them out. Yeah, totally. Yeah, you're an inconvenience.

And I asked them, I was like, what kind of pasta is this? Are they all in flannel shirts? Yeah. Well, the ones that didn't- weren't wearing, like, sleeveless shirts so they could show off their tattoos in flannel shirts. But I have to say the steps of service were fantastic. They were spot on. And every single thing, you know, it's a good restaurant when you eat there and you don't even think about something being bad, you know? Like, you're eating like, oh, that's really good. And by the end of the meal, I was like, Jesus, everything was great. Like, great. So I had a great time. And my wife put that together.

I- something that I really enjoyed today, Nick, was while you guys are doing Call It a Greg Live, Nick looks over at me and is having an actual real moment. Very few times has that happened in my life. Nick never has real moments. And he goes, I don't know what it's like to be an adult. Last night I hung out with adults. It was weird. I couldn't connect with things. And it's so funny because it's like, you're stuck with us. We- this is our life. We just got to create a Legos today. Yeah. We're super pumped about it.

And sat down with some of my old friends and try to catch up with them. But I realized that my point of reference for their lives has changed now.

You're not having those shared experiences with them where you can just immediately flip the switch when you walk out the door and like, let's talk. Well, over here, the Pride of Long Island Colin Moriarty, you had Jared Petty over not too long ago and Jared Petty has been off of Twitter at this time for like two or three weeks or whatever.

It's like headstands, tripod stands, crow poses, things like tripod stands. Yeah. Okay. We make a tripod. You put your hand up supposedly in the we did 11 sex stuff right now. The celebrity guest season is going and we did one with Trisha Hershberger and then the intro you're doing some yoga and you said this is warrior one. From what I hear you said it was warrior one.

And that backstory is that back when we were at IGN, YouTube started this program where if you get a certain amount of subscribers, like they send you these awards or whatever, if you get a million subscribers, you get this big old gold one. Right. If you get a hundred thousand gold, you get this smaller silver one.

And it hit a hundred and we eventually they sent us these things, but it wasn't ours. We didn't own it. We helped build it. We did all that, but we didn't own it. And then we started this shit. I remember we were having a talk at 1st Amendment and we're like, we need that. We need that to be ours. We now have two of them. Yeah. So yes, we got our silver play buttons from YouTube thanking us on a hundred thousand subs. Now, if you're watching this, you might say you guys have had a hundred thousand subs for a long time.

I thought that they did film it somewhere else too. And but he was he talked about that in the New York Post page six article. So it was over at IGN Alex Osborne writes an article saying despite prior reports claiming George Miller's done making Mad Max movies the Fury Road director says he still has more planned for the franchise. Miller told The Wrap he is he was misquoted in a recent interview after traveling for 27 hours calling it a quote completely garbled interview in which the journalists got the wrong fragments of information that were just not true.

Yeah the book is far superior. And this is this is what I was talking about with a good corollary to this is is The Road with Cormac McCarthy's The Road and then the movie.

Right. But with The Martian I saw The Martian Aaron and I watched it over Christmas break and I was excited to see it. And I was a little disappointed and I'm like this is why is everyone so crazy about this? This isn't nearly nearly as good as the book.

The last time the one at Sarah Monte the bathroom it was like it was post-apocalyptic you know what I mean? The bathroom. And it was like one in the afternoon. And I'm like what did anyone clean the bathroom yesterday? And I remember actually tweeting about it and they like got back to me and be like Oh reach out and let us know.

I'm like whatever the Buffalo Wild Wings and ceremony is one of the places where the um the paper towels are always a disaster and there are sinks set up in such a stupid ass way that no matter what when it comes out it's going to touch the sink. So then you have to like make the sacrificial paper towels which I'm sure the environmentalist love. And then so that should happen. Then all of a sudden there's just this like graveyard of white paper towels everywhere. And then there's the people that just like you know kind of make like a slope and then just fucking let that thing go and then just rip one off. And it's just like there's just like a slight of paper towels. That's now touching the floor and it's like good Lord. Wild wings. I do enjoy. I liked their wings.

I liked him because they're okay. I hate the food of Buffalo Wild Wings as a whole but I love Buffalo Wild Wings still just goes back to my point. I love that place. Fucking sit there forever. Wild wings will always have a special place in my heart. Cause you were talking about how there wasn't a Chili's really where you were right. And in the olden days of being a kid I remember when there was the Chili's and then on the other side of Wheaton they opened up another Chili's. And I remember when we found out about Buffalo Wild Wings in Elmhurst and it became the farthest place we would ever drive and where we would go and we would drive the 35 to 45 minutes to go",

Me and my dumb ass friends to go out there. We'd get there and we'd be those morons that were there all night long. We were the morons who sat at Buffalo Wild Wings on when it was 5 cent wing Tuesday sat there all night long and then close the place down and then drive back and go play in state of play football. We were also my friends were also the type of morons who would go to the jukebox put in $10 and play only Metallica. And then our waitress would come by and show us another tab from another group that was like here's. And then it was like tip no tip. And then she wrote in don't play all this Metallica.

I'm gonna give you what makes you go there though. I love the the burger with the um Jack Daniel sauce. Oh my God. I'm gonna give a shout out to the Jack Daniels wings. I'm also gonna give a shout out to their they have a tostada nacho if I'm not mistaken. That's the bomb. They have that big platter that they can get like the platter of appetizers that always comes out kind of cold. But you're like it's impossible to get those things all to come out at the same time.

I only know it from where it was. Every time I yeah there was like there was a good run every year. We'd have to we inevitably be forced to go to that one because someone screwed up a lunch order and we have to send someone down there. Fuck that place.

So yeah freeze dried first you know fried first and frozen then refried again. So it's all terrible for you. That is the one thing that when you when you do go to these nicer restaurants to Colin's point like the quality of food in and no doubt is better and undoubtedly better because you're using fresher ingredients and in San Francisco it comes with the air of pretentiousness but you are getting like organic vegetables stuff that like they're like we grow this shit right outside.

When you're willing to like show people exactly what you're doing it's usually a pretty good sign that the food's good but it's not for everyone. I mean like if you like you know I'll pay $35 for Wayfair chickens fried chicken injected with Rosemary and time and all this kind of stuff because it's recommend. Chef Tyler does recommend you put some lemon on it because it's fucking awesome. It's worth $35 and their old fashions are worth $10 and their sazeracs are worth $1 like but to not to everyone.

Like you know you have your Suzuki bourbon like your like your shitty kind of like like yeah like your your Jim Beam or your Evan Williams which is fine. Like it's not sipping bourbon but it's good for cocktails or Old Forester or whatever.

And so like you don't want to pay too much for your food but you don't want to pay too little for your food either. I think like right in that little sweet spot right in the middle where you're getting a 15 to 25 or $30 entree I think is perfect. I don't I'm not paying $70 for an entree unless it's like a beautiful steak. But you know so what I'm saying is like you don't want to predicate the quality of the food based on what you're paying for it but there is something to be said about the quality of the food and what you're paying for.
