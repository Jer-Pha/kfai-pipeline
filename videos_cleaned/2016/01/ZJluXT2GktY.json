Hey everybody, this is exciting. Today's going to be a fun show. I just talked to Greg for two solid hours. This is going to be the new hotness. We're all, we got all the, you're loose now. You got all the bad stuff out, all the junk's out of your system. You're here to throw gold. I spewed the junk all over you, and now we're good to go. That was, but that wasn't on C. Don't wor, remember the Gone Homecast is up right now on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames. Spoilers started an hour and 15 minutes, hour 15 minutes in.

So I just want to know what, what kind of, what kind of games you were playing. My favorite game, uh, that I played over the holiday break was chain smoking in Las Vegas, which is my favorite. You understand that that particular game that I like to play. Uh, in terms of, in terms of video games, uh, I played, I've played three games recently that I'll talk a little bit about. The first one, Overachiever. Uh, people have been busting balls about Metal Gear Solid 5, so I started finally really getting into that, and I played it for about 10 hours. Um, and we talk, what did we talk about this? What did we talk about, Colin, Greg? We, we talked about this on the last Gamescast, the last gam, you didn't go detailed thought, right? Right.

So yeah, I, and I won't, I won't belabor that because I want to talk about the other games more, but it's a Metal Gear game for two hours. I enjoyed the, or not even, I enjoyed the very, the beginning. I think it's **** awesome. Uh, and then it turned into a game I didn't really want to play. So who, um, that's kind of backwards from I think a lot of people's experiences. Oh, welcome to Colin. It absolutely is. It's just, it's, you really loved like just a driven experience, and you didn't want to be in the open world. Yeah, it's just not what I'm looking for with Metal Gear. I, I, I, as I said, I think on the last Gamescast, it's, appreciate the aesthetic value, you know, the, the, the production values, the aesthetics, great. Uh, I like the depth of it.

Um, just not what I'm looking for in a Metal Gear game, and I don't think it's the epitome of gameplay that like that that people talk about it as it is. I think as I said on the previous one, I think there's, there's many examples of third person shooter. I feel better. So it's, it's to which all the comments go, it's a stealth game. Okay, just, it could be whatever you want, just saving them the trouble of putting it below this video. It could be whatever you want to be. I did love, as I said, I loved that loop of uh, clearing things out, being very silent until, you know, until you're found after 45 minutes. You **** wanted to throw your controller out the window. Um, but so I appreciate it. It's there. I wanted to give it a go, but it's not a game I have any interest in going back. What is your favorite",

What is your favorite Metal Gear Solid game two? Okay, right, Colin, welcome this thing. Uh, and then so the other games, the other two games I was messing around with. Uh, I never got through it. I, I'm a huge fan of Wolfenstein: The New Order. I think the game's **** cool as hell. Um, so I went and I earlier this year, May or whatever it was, The Old Blood came out, the DLC, and I got like halfway through it, and then I just stopped playing it. Um, so I just deleted my save and started playing it again, and I got about halfway through it, and and still and haven't beaten it yet. Uh, but I just, I really love MachineGames. I **** love those guys. Like I, I just think they understand the story driven first-person shooter. I think the game feels great. I think it's, it's not quite on Call of Duty's level in terms of the way maybe it feels, but",

I think it's, it's not quite on Call of Duty's level in terms of the way maybe it feels, but it's pretty close. Um, you know, to me that is the high watermark of shooters in terms of gameplay. Um, were you a fan of um, Riddick? Uh, and I, I played Riddick back, I played Riddick back on Xbox, the original Xbox. So yeah, that was, that was the last Riddick I played because I think there's been like one or two since then that I did not **** with. Yeah, that game was, that game was awesome, yeah, back in the day. And The Darkness, I thought was really, really good, and that was I think the core team that went off to form MachineGames. So yeah, no, I mean, those, those guys know what they're doing, and it's, I'm excited to see like, you know, clearly they'll probably do another Wolfenstein. I think that's going to be great. So I was messing around with that. I recommend that. I, I, I just, I haven't gotten through it because I'm so",

And I still love their emphasis on the dream sequences in those games. Like I, I, I think it's so fun. I don't know if you played them, whatever, when you find the beds in the, in the game and play an original Wolfenstein, it's like a nightmare. Yeah, I'm like, I'm like, that's so, oh, I love that idea. Uh, the third game that I know is a little bit old for people that played on Xbox One or PC, but I just, we just got codes for, and I just started playing as The Banner Saga. Um, okay, which is cool as hell. Again, it's, it's a little obtuse in some of its mechanics. Um, story is a little confusing. It's very like Norse, and and it's, you know, so some of the names are a little",

It's very like Norse, and and it's, you know, so some of the names are a little confusing, hard to keep up with like who's who. But I do like the, the, the combat in terms of there being like an armor class and a and a strength class, and you have to damage them both in order to whittle these enemies down. I think it's quite clever and quite deep. Um, if you basically like if your armor, if the enemy's armor is above your attack, then there's a 10% chance per point above your attack that they will block your attack. So you have to whittle their armor down first. I think it's like really super clever. And then, but you can still get lucky and and get a hit on them even if their armor is really high. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. And it's all, there's a bunch of choices. Like I, not, there's no permadeath in the game in battle, but there's permadeath in the choices you make around the battles. Um, and",

Um, and I had this one instance where I like tried to save, you know, this girl was under attack, and I did the wrong thing, and she's, she's gone. Like she's just gone from the story. Um, so I, I, I was, I, I dig a lot. Um, it reminds me that, you know, what we talked about with Final Fantasy Tactics, which I think is one of the great games of all time, or Tactics Ogre, especially Let Us Cling Together on PSP, which is a fantastic **** game. We need more of these. Fire Emblem, Fire Emblem. Although I don't, I, Fire Emblem is a similar game, but I just don't feel like in a similar way to The Banner Saga, it's, it's not all the way what I want. Fire Emblem is even further away from what I'm really looking for. I'm really interested in why that is. Like I wonder what is, did you play the 3DS one? Yeah, the, the 3DS, uh, yeah, I played it",

Yeah, the, the 3DS, uh, yeah, I played it for five hours or so. It's just, um, I thought that was really great, but I'm, I'm also not like a hardcore Final Fantasy Tactics or Tactics Ogre guy. So it's just one of those, it's the same thing with Disgaea, where I'm just like, this is not what I want. Like I, I, I want this very specific SquareSoft style that I mean, SquareSoft back like old style, you know, even Advance Wars or whatever on on GBA and DS. I think was like way more aligned with what I want. I don't know quite how to explain it. Fire Emblem just doesn't resonate with me at all. Here's a question, did speaking of Metal Gear, did you play Metal Gear or Metal Gear Acid on PSP? No, I didn't. You should. So Metal Gear Acid One was a little like they're trying to figure it out.

I played a little bit of Acid as a huge Metal Gear fan on the original, never bothered with two. No, two, it's like really rare. They did it, they didn't ship a lot, it didn't do well. I think you can only get it on UMD, like you have to track it down or whatever. Um, but I played all the way through that game. They figured out the gameplay. It's really interesting, like smart card based, tile based tactics, uh, game, and like just a good wacky like Metal Gear Side Story. Um, so track it down. I think you, I think you would actually really like Metal Gear Acid 2. Sounds like it, sounds like it would hit like the thing you're talking about. Yeah, scratch that itch because it is, it is a very specific itch because it's not just strategy like turn based strategy role playing games. I like, like I played Disgaea, and I appreciate it.

Like this is not even remotely what I'm looking for, even though aesthetically it looks like it could be a a new Disgaea. Is different though, because that's kind of a never ending thing. Yeah, and it's also like stacking enemies on the same tile, you're doing billions of points of damage. I'm like, what the ****? Parody in a lot of ways. Tactics, especially like War of the Lions on PSP, which I think is the epitome of that, you know, the nice translation and and all that is just, I don't understand how they, how Square doesn't understand that they can make that game again and sell it even for $60 if they really wanted to. They don't have to upgrade. Valkyria Chronicles is probably like the closest thing that that that anyone has gotten, but these, these, I don't know, it's just it, it Banner",

Uh, so far from when I played, I played it for, you know, four hours last night. I actually played it for a few hours, went to bed, started reading about one-way trips, Tom Mars, Kevin. That's what we're talking about that today. And then I just got back out of bed and played it again because I was just, it was just on my mind. So, um, so I recommend it, but it reminds me of what I really want. It's like almost there. Yeah, you, but it is exceptionally beautiful. It has that incredibly beautiful like kind of mid-century, uh, you know, cinematic animation style to it. Like all just like the, the color palettes and stuff are gorgeous.

We did that on the, the last episode, but like if you want to expand on anything, like most of my stuff is just expansions on that stuff. Okay, so I ran through the Batman: Arkham Knight DLC, got all the trophies in that. I was very excited. I like trophy, Steve Gaynor. You might not know this about what color trophy did you? I prefer platinums, 'cause again, platinums signify the game's real. And when a downloadable game releases without a platinum, everybody's like, what is this? If Taco Master could have a platinum, clearly Game of the Year 2013 should have one. Kevin went through, did all the Batman DLC.

In reality, it was jump back into your game, and it's just another tab of side missions now with their own little wheel expand on, which we always talk about how smart that is. Uh, jumped in, did all those. Then I went through and did all the rest of the Batmobile challenges, all the combat challenges for all the different characters and stuff. Had a great time. Uh, loved it. Really, you a lot of silver trophies, a lot of rewarding, rewarding things. It was fun to run around as Ben Affleck Batman.

No, no, not that one, just the one with the, you know, he's a stockier Batman, the big S on the chest, small years. Yeah, yeah. So I did that. Um, played Bastion on Vita. Got my first gameplay playthrough out of the way. Gotta start, I started the New Game Plus, but I got to commit to it, but we have some more trips coming up, so that's part of that, along with Volume, which finally came to Vita, but I haven't started.

See like Bastion, just letting you know, maybe you patch in a DLC platinum trophy. Um, what else then? Oh, Life Is Strange was the big one. Life Is Strange. Did you finish the whole season? And I platinumed it. Uh, yeah, I did. So you're saying that even games starring teen girls who are going, even games starring teen girls going through growth and personal change, they can have platinums as well. Wow. Life Is Strange was totally awesome. Like I said in the Game of the Year episode last year, if I, or last year, last episode, if I had played that and had enough time to digest it, I think it would have definitely hit on my top 10 list of the year, but I played it late.

Thought the story was really intriguing, and that's what I think threw me is the fact that playing through episode one when it first came out, I was just playing it. It's like, oh cool, like she has the ability to rewind time or whatever. And then at the end, there's like this big, not twist, but like big thing that sets up it, but it seemed out of place, whereas in context of all five at once, you're like, oh, this makes sense. And I'm, and now I know these people, 'cause like even ending that first episode, like I didn't have like super strong feelings about Victoria or this person or that person.

You know, I sit down and play it, and I'm playing a pre-release build, so I've run into a few bugs and stuff where I've had to restart things, and it's like, uh, and so it's like screwing up the pacing, I feel like, of what's supposed to be happening.
