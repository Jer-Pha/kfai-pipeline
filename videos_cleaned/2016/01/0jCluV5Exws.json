            "text": "you done with that so Joven, Nick, yes today we got a question from 20-year-old Kevin. Kevin writes in and says, \"So I used to like this girl and she ended up going out with one of my friends. Three years on and they have broken up. Is it wrong for me to now go after her?\" Wait, so he's trying to date one of his friend's ex-girlfriends? Yes. And how good of friends are they still? He he also liked her before they started dating. See, that's when we get into tricky water about that. That means that you've been just sitting there in the background laying in wait as you also maybe didn't have what it took to be able to get the relationship at the time, but now you've leveled up. You're good. You're you're place. I'm going to say whether they are how strong their friendship is, uh, the answer is yes, if you don't mind finding a new friend because it's it's it's not going to work out afterwards because here's the thing, if it does blossom into something great, uh, then she's going to be coming around a lot and",

What if the breakup was was clean, an amicable breakup? It is a very rare situation where it seems that way, but that's just like on the surface. Underneath, there's there's this burning resentment that you, \"It's so good to see you. How are you? Okay, how's the sex?\" Oh, great, great. Chances are things might not work out with you guys and then all of a sudden you're in a weird place with a friend and this whole situation. There's there's millions of fish and that is a big gamble also afterwards because if you wind up breaking up with her afterwards, then you're out of friend and and it's like you go back like, \"Oh man, I know what you were talking about,\" or you might have that bonding experience if you're willing to",

I've had that happen before, but it's not something you really want to be gambling with if you if you value your friendship, which Jovenshire, the uh, the second situation it is okay is if you know that there is a timeline on said relationship. So if I'm like, \"Hey man, she was kind of hot. Like, I'm just going to, you know, maybe spend a month with this, just like a month. Are you cool that?\" \"Yeah, dude, she crazy, but good luck.\" Well, I think I think the big thing there, as we always talk about on the show, is communication. This time, not so much communication with the girl as much as with your friend. So talk, put your friend in a real bad spot. You put your friend in a real bad spot because your friend going to go like this,",

You put your friend in a real bad spot because your friend going to go like this, \"Sure, dude,\" 'cause if he's a good friend, he's going to be like, \"That's fine,\" and then he's going to start harboring resentment and then you're one of you going have to die. No, if he's a if he's a good friend, he's going to say no. If he's a good friend, he doesn't want it. He he he'll say no. Need to be honest. Good friend should be honest. If if and if he's like a if he's a good person, like, \"You know what? Yeah, it there were parts that were great. Enjoy those parts.\" Yeah, while they last. The first two months is fantastic. Get out. You got 60 days tops. After that, I'm gone or she's gone. Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us for Love & Sex Stuff every Monday, 9:00 a.m. Kinda Funny.
