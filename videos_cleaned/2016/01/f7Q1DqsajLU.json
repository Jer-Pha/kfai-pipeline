Now here's the thing, this is a new segment of this show when we have gentlemen like yourself on that that create these games or ladies or ladies you're correct Nicole tan answer my calls yeah come on I want you to pitch us on why Tacoma is going to be awesome it is going to be the killer app for VR that's what he was waiting for the whole time you know what I have discovered to killer after Tacoma uh we're not doing a VR version um so Tacoma takes place on Space Station um from the creators of Gone Home Colin sold yeah you got Gone Home you got space Gone Home in space I mean I'm done right there we go no um the I I guess um here's the truth I haven't worked on the the elevator pitched very much I don't I don't have the like part one part two part three nailed it um I think that on some level that's because we are still really internalizing what the heart of that experience is but I'll try now so Tacoma is a you know",
