I am one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the producer, SL Seducer, Nick Scarpino. I always get a little depressed with myself when I have Taco Bell and Pachi Pizza in the same day.

God, I hope the audio is fine right now. Alex O'Neal will tell us in the Twitch chat if something's wrong, but it doesn't matter. That's what's happening ladies and gentlemen. If you didn't know, there's a lot of stuff going on right now. Clearly, we're out in the living room, which is where the GameOverGreggy Show started. Clearly, it's January 5th, 2016. We're recording this on our one-year anniversary of going independent. Thank you all for your support. Thank you. Clearly appreciate Kevin's on the show so something's gone wrong.

And what's gone wrong is the fact that today, January 5th, 2016, we launched Kinda Funny the Animated Series The Pilot, which of course was a milestone from patreon.com/kindafunny. We launched it. We were so proud of it that we decided we wanted to do an entire year of shows, 11 more episodes. And so what we've been doing all day long since 10:00 a.m. is streaming on twitch.tv/kindafunnygames where we've been raising money in a ton kind of thing, sending people to patreon.com/kindafunny to donate right there. If you are watching this right now and you love what we do, we would love you to go over and give whatever you can on patreon.com/kindafunny because all the money raised during the month of January goes to the next 11 episodes if we get there of Kinda Funny the Animated Series. That's the idea. We're trying to raise $75,000, which is a lot, but Tim what are we at already? We are currently at let me load this. I want the up-to-date numbers.",

And what we've been doing over on twitch.tv/kfun games doing the ton is setting mini goals, one of which was to get Kevin on the show, one of which was to get drunk during the show and do GameOverGreggy Show and quotes after dark.
