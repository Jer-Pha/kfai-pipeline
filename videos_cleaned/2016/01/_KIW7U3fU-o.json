They were spot-on and every single thing, you know, it's a good restaurant when you eat there and you don't puke, even think about something being bad. You know, like you're eating like it's really good. And by the, by the end of the meal, I was like, Jesus, everything was great, like great. So I had a great time and my wife put that together.

Yeah, it's not easy. Unforgiving. Punishing is what some people might say. Um, yeah, I mean, I would say that still probably carries. Are we, are we getting to the point where we're making our resolutions now? We're in 2016. Let's start with you. You, you get your Limelight that was robbed of you. Um, orange. Yeah, I'd like to drink a lot more orange juice to start. Just only orange juice. Just get off my coffee diet and just go to orange juice. Um, it's so hard 'cause I always, I always think like, I'm never really going to do any of this stuff. Sure. These resolutions are like made to be broken.
