I don't know if it qualifies because I don't know if it's coming out this year or not, um, but because you know I don't I don't have not up to date on the release dates as I used to be, but uh, Detroit: Become Human. Oh yeah, I used to know all of them before, but that's because I looked at them all the time and I would create the list for you guys like a weirdo. Um, but uh, Detroit: Become Human to me looks really cool. I I love story-based games. I love um, I I love games that put you in a character and say now experience it through their eyes. They're not, it's because a lot of games nowadays they put you like Fallout and they put you in a world where you're essentially the character and you you're and you're changing how everything happens and this one in in that game I have some really good storytellers putting you in a very good-looking uh environment telling you to experience this albeit familiar story of the robots versus the humans, um, but",

Uh, I brought my wife, I'm like, check, take a look at this, look at this. This is this is that demo we saw of Kara from forever ago for yeah, however on PS3, yeah. Um, so yeah, I mean that game to me, I think especially coming off of Beyond: Two Souls, which I thought was not the strongest game compared to Heavy Rain, yeah, I would really like to see where that game goes because um, those guys know what they're doing. Uh, I way back when I reviewed Omikron: The Nomad Soul, the David Bowie game that they worked on, and uh, I was a fan of that and so they they definitely know what they're doing, um, and I I'd like",

It looks like a great idea. I hope it's a return to form, you know what I mean? Because it from the Kara trailer, right? We all like that was a cool idea and they're like, oh, not even maybe maybe it's a game, maybe it's not, we don't know what you're like, okay, well, make that game and then they, you know, did and here we are and I hope it delivers on what we want it to be.

And I'm also hoping that it's this year. Yeah, yeah, I I don't I don't think it is. I don't I don't know that it'll even be next year. I don't I don't know. I don't know that they're quiet about it. I agree with you that they have something to prove. I think Beyond: Two Souls by most accounts is a huge disappointment.

It was just it was so good that we overlooked a lot of the mechanical shortcomings of it, so I think that it'll be um 2017 at the earliest. I don't I don't I don't know, but I I do",

I like, yeah, the machine versus human thing is old, but this game like like Ex Machina the movie deals exclusively with what is reality and what is consciousness and that's that's that's not something that is necessarily as as played in fiction as just the humans versus the machines, Skynet or Cylons or something like that. It's not that's not what it seems like it's really about. It seems like it's about consciousness. It's it's like the Isaac Asimov approach, yeah, and I think that that's going to be a super exciting way to explore that story, so I hope I hope it's good and I will say by the way, even though it's it's talking about games this year, Until Dawn, I loved that game.

I would love to see an Until Dawn 2, completely different setting, um, not the VR thing. The VR thing I think is uh more more of a tech thing, shitty. It's just not what like a shooter. You I enjoy I my favorite VR thing I've done so far has been Until Dawn: Rush of Blood or whatever the hell it's called, but I agree with you, they have something special there.

I don't think it's going to, but I, you know, as someone that travels a lot, it's really exciting. Someone has their phone on them all the time. Like it's exciting to think about what that game could be and just like trying to capture Pok\u00e9mon, going to all these different places and like seeing seeing what the actual gameplay of it is. I think I'm most excited for because that could instantly go completely off my list. Like the moment I actually see some stuff, which supposedly is at GDC in a couple weeks, we'll see that that would really change stuff, but also there's a Pok\u00e9mon Direct coming up on Friday that we're recording the show, so by the time this post like we'll know",

I'm hoping that it has multiple regions and it's not just if they just announced Pok\u00e9mon Z or like Pok\u00e9mon X and Y or whatever, I would be so disappointed and I'm just be like, God damn it. Like that is, but at the same time, it's like I also want them to stop putting resources into the 3DS and stuff and just go to the NX and just like, you know, you know, start there and do something right there. But uh Pok\u00e9mon Go, you know, they're saying 2016 and they they've said that since the first trailer and they're sticking to it, so I'm hoping that we hear a lot more soon and I'm hoping that it's as good as I wish it will be.

I want to know is it VR related as my prediction once said? Uh, in general, I just want to see this game come out. It's had so much hype for so long and I think at E3 this year, past E3, was the one where they came on stage, did the demo and they and I was just like, what the **** is this game? Stop doing this. And then we got to go behind closed doors in a loft and play it for like 30 minutes and talk to the team about what the game is and I left that one being like, okay, like I get it now.

I'm going to jump in here and chill out and just fly through the galaxy and land and see this planet and do this and find that or da da da and go off and then keep getting closer and closer to the center and they keep talking about adding to it, you know, \u00e0 la Minecraft, where, all right, this won't be there when we launch, but down the road we want to do this, we want to do this, we want to do that. So if it is one of those things that's an ever-evolving platform in a way, right? That could be really cool. Will it come together? I don't know. Will it, you know, I mean, will it be totally boring?

This sucks. I doubt it, but maybe that's, you know, it's a possibility. Mainly, I'm just excited based on the little taste they gave me. I do want more, but what it's going to be in the end, I don't know. I'm looking forward to that game. I think that the challenge they're up against is the one that you cited exactly. It's that there's been so much buildup for it for so long that there's already these unrealistic expectations about what this game should be and it can still be end up being a very very great game and which is not proper English, but it could still it could still end up being incredible and just because it's had so much hype and build up that it's still it's",

Uh, is expectations get ahead of reality. Yeah, it's so I'm I'm wishing those guys the best because I want to play that game too. Yeah, um, but my from uh from my standpoint as part of a game, I'd be worried that doesn't matter how good it gets that people aren't just going to that they're going to say that didn't live up to its potential no matter what. Yeah, yeah, it looks it looks good. I agree with you. It's going to be a victim of hype though. Yep. I think uh next up for me, Homefront: The Revolution.

Game takes place in Philadelphia, which I think is a really cool setting. I can't think of a single game that takes place in Philadelphia. Um, so I like that setting. It also I think is a is a connection to the American Revolution and kind of origin. Rocky Legends, thank you. That takes place in Philadelphia. That's a good point. Um, I like the I like the contained open world nature of the game. Uh, the original Homefront was short. The campaign was short.

It reminded me a lot of Red Dawn, you know, that John Milius was involved in some way with the game. Um, but this particular one takes more of a um step-by-step approach in terms of like you're going to take over this part of the city and then you're going to do these side quests and you have to destroy these cameras and these patrols and do all these things and play it like it's a Far Cry",

Fourth pick, fourth. Oh, that is uh Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I love that movie so much. Uh, I saw it twice. I know it has its issues because of how close it is to the first film, but I didn't care. I enjoyed it. My family chicks, ew. Um, and it's a good game that I can play with my daughters who love who love Star Wars and they really liked Rey and Finn. Everywhere I go, they're asking for Rey and Finn stuff. Um, and like they won't make Rey stuff. We have we stuff. We went to Disneyland and and bought some Rey stuff and um, but the the fact that I can actually play these games with my kids now that they're getting to the age to where they can play the games that I used to play because back way back in the day, I I'd play Lego games like crazy and the first one was Lego",
