How? 10 years, my God, 10 years. I was there 1999 to 2009 before they had televisions dropping the water, dropping the bucket. I mean, just talking about like how how is it and like what's what are the major you? I miss the people. I I I so my last day at IGN was very hard on me, not because I was leaving the job, but because I was leaving you and Colin and Chris Roper and Hillary Goldstein and Fran Mirabella and Matt Cina and all those other guys that we had worked with for so long because it felt like true family and that's that's the hardest part. I actually prefer this side of the job much more because I get to enjoy games as an observer. I don't know a whole bunch of things about games before they come out, which is took away from things like RPGs, which I love to play in horror games and story-based games, and now I can just",

I can choose how involved I am in the trailers and the unveiling of them, so I actually prefer it quite a bit. And I I have a direct hand in how games are made, which is as someone who likes to write and likes likes to create is a really good feeling when you're here's evidence of something I've done and other people are enjoying it on multiple levels, be it game design or a story or just the overall direction of certain elements of the game. I mean, those are all different things that I've been involved with since I left. And pointing out, you wrote Unit 13. I did, yeah, for Vita. I did. And that was a great experience for me because I learned a lot about how just how much work goes into a story-based game and how many different variables you have to account for. And there",

We learned a lot in the process and we had all these things to choose from and there was a lot involved in in being able to be there for the VO recording and working with the director. And it was it was a fantastic experience and I got to meet lots of people involved in in the Hollywood industry that were there that were also giving us pointers on on how to record good VO and make good dialogue. And so I I was really happy. Every every little element of each game that I work on has has taught me something new, which is I think the sign of a good industry to be a part of.",

Yeah, got a couple questions from the good old audience here. David Hannah wants to know how much Beyond did you listen to after you left IGN? Not as much as I wanted to, son of a bitch. I didn't listen to every episode. I did listen to some. It's if my phone is over there, you can see it's it's on my subscription list. The real problem is time and I would just get so involved in working that a lot of the stuff I used to do or watch watch or listen to regularly just went to the wayside. But I would I would drop in and listen to these guys semi-regularly. I'd say maybe once every two or three weeks. It's the same thing for us now. I mean, I was talk about when I when we were for us, it was the when we worked in Brisbane, you know, IGN before it moved downtown and I had a huge commute. I listened to every IGN podcast and granted that I was on the majority of them.",

So I like I was up on NVC and everything else, you know what I mean? And then when we moved downtown, the commute got halved and I didn't feel like listening to a podcast over eight trips or something, you know what I mean? And then now we're just so busy. Yeah, I don't have a chance to listen to any of our friends. Yeah, yeah. And that's that that's the unfortunate downside of of just being busy. Keeping on the topic of Beyond, Jose Lewis says, what did you expect from Greg from when Greg became the anchor and Beyond and did the expectation become reality? I knew we'd do a great job. So, um, we had launched Podcast Beyond and nobody else wanted to do podcast but us, if you remember. I remember that. It was the stupidest idea when you said,",

Why are we taking away from Game Scoop? What are you doing? Uh, it worked out though. It did. It panned out quite well. No, no, no, no. Uh, but nobody wanted to do it. And so, uh, in the beginning, it was to forcing everyone to do it. And then I had to force everyone to do it. But I thought that at the beginning that would be a fun way for us to communicate with our fans in a way that we couldn't before because at that time in 2007, is that what it was? Yeah, yeah, 2007.

Sausage and Squeeze overnight, shittiest trailers up and made that that giant video processing machine in the corner that cost tens of thousands of dollars that took forever and it would always goes go down. But um, it was an opportunity for us. It was a really it was a nice way for us to reach out and we were looking at teams like the Nintendo team, Matt and uh, at the time it was Matt and Bohan and Craig Parris. And uh, and that was it.

And uh, I knew the second that uh, we were in the groove, which didn't take long because we work together all the time. But it felt good. It's it felt like a good episode that Greg would do very well and that all of us would do a pretty good job of explaining what we need to do. Greg was obviously the standout because he was he is a lot more personable than any any of the other folks on the show. We were more about like getting the work done and some of us didn't want to be there. Um, but I always talk about it, right?

And there was that thing where, you know, you know, Colin and Clement and everybody else followed by four months, five months later, you know what I mean? But I was that tip of the sword where Damon was there and he kind of needed a cohort because he wanted to do all this video and podcasty stuff, but he had lost David, he had lost Kathleen, all these people. And then I got there and I was like, this is all I've ever wanted to do. I'll do everything. And I was staying doing SmackDown videos at 3:00 in the morning on Friday nights and you know what I mean? And it was the thing of like, yeah, when you put me in front of the microphone, I I was the only person in that room, right, who had literally been on the outside two months before listening to podcast.",

And well, also, you had it built in in that you were just somebody who was interesting. The reason I hired Greg is because and you bring it up earlier in the the show that we did this morning and that's that, um, you know, we had so many applications coming through. I would read them all. I would read every application we got because whoever I was going to hire to the editorial team was very important, especially when they were working directly on on my team where at the time was just the PlayStation team. And Greg's was the only application that stood out to me as being interesting.

And I think I sent it to like 11:00 at night or midnight or whatever it was. Responded in like 15 minutes, man. And that's what I always talk about the story, right, is that, you know, on my Gmail, which is the email I started right after I left Mizzou, so I'm sure there's a whole bunch of the old Mizzou account I had. But on my Gmail at the time, this was my 13th application to IGN.

And then I was hired on the road the next that day at 6:00 p.m. So it's like my my life, my dreams all came through overnight. And I was talking about like in the interview with you and Roper, I remember and I'm pacing in the basement of the news the newspaper talking to you or whatever. There was a moment where I did the, well, yeah, you know what I've been doing on my blog is or on on the blog for thing. And you said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

And so to get out there and have you read them already. But I mean, that blew my mind. Well, it showed and you can you can tell talent when when you read it. And and that's part of that's part of what just got him in the door and why he took off and why he did a good job of Beyond because once he was part of the team, you know, energy and enthusiasm is infectious too.

Well, the funny thing too, and I don't know if you recognize it because I don't know. I mean, I thank you a lot, obviously, I hope. Uh, but like one of the reasons I think for sure why Beyond was so successful, sure, for sure, I think, which then translate to why I were so successful is because when you started Beyond and you that was because you started then had you immediately transcended and went up and Roper took over. But the one thing you did is like, this is on everybody's calendar at this time. We are doing this. You don't miss this. And all the other channels were, ah, fuck, we'll get to when we get to it. And there's been three weeks without a three red lights or whatever, you know what I mean? And all",

And there's been three weeks without a three red lights or whatever, you know what I mean? And all this other stuff. Whereas like Beyond was there consistently, da da da. And that's why Beyond grew and grew and grew until it was the number one podcast for right because it you knew it was going to be there. And granted, it was like easy in a way because once you say that you do that, you know that, you know what I mean? And Game Scoop couldn't be that because Damon was trying to get herd cats together to go do it, you know what I mean? And then the other channels all had their own thing. But like you established that, which then I, you know, we carried over for Beyond when I took over. I carried over for Beyond. And then it's something we do here, right? We're like Colin & Greg Live is this this day. And like the days at least we we sometimes have to be more malleable. There's only five of us. The moral of the story",

There's only five of us. The moral of the story for everyone listening is if you create a schedule and stick to it, you will become famous. Exactly. You'll become super successful. Very true. I mean, I honestly, I've seen that time and time again. Consistency, right? I mean, that was the thing of like, you know, I always talk about it with even with Beyond when Roper left or and and I took over and it was, you know, me, Clement and Colin. I always talk about it. People always talk about like, oh, you guys were so great on Beyond and this that and the other. I'm like, yeah, but if you remember, Roper leaves in the one teens, 110s. And it wasn't until 150 where I was like, we have here's the logo. This is the show. We have a vibe. And it felt that's when it felt like everything was clicked into place because it was weird to go from being able to be the guy who just screams",

And it felt that's when it felt like everything was clicked into place because it was weird to go from being able to be the guy who just screams Beyond and sings a song at the end of the show to having to drive it and make sure it all worked. So when you were when this is also fascinating to me, when you know, podcasts weren't what they are now. And like they weren't monetizable. Like it's not like they were making money. I mean, even when we were like leaving IGN, it's not like that was ever really figured out like how does how do these audio podcasts make money? Um, what was the goal? Like were you you were talking about like, you know, getting with the community and like being talk to them. But like why were you like, all right, we need to make this a consistency thing because like that was still kind of a new idea then.

So yeah, Tal who's the VP of Game Scoop VP. I don't even know what the hell he does over there any. His whole initiative was, uh, he wanted to have podcast because they, you know, there was an opportunity for us to get into a space that not a lot of people were in from a very a very smart way to to approach it. And then each individual team had its own reasons why it wanted to or didn't want to do it. Uh, the reason I wanted to do ours in particular, the PlayStation stuff is because it was really a good outlet for us to talk to our to our readers at that because there weren't really viewers. There were videos are few and far between in a way that we couldn't normally do. And it",

And even though our articles were already conversational in tone, it's it's much different when you're trying to remember this is forever. The people are reading this. This is representing the site. And this is the official review or official preview or whatever. Whereas here, we were just sitting in a room enjoying the company that we have and the rapport that we have on a day-to-day basis talking about stuff that we've been wanting to talk about all week long.

Maybe it's a new Uncharted, which at the time really wasn't even a thing. Would be maybe it's a new Resistance or maybe it's new Ratchet & Clank or Jak and Daxter. So it really depended. It was a great way to connect. I mean, because you figure like at the time, IGN did not have comments on articles, you know what I mean? There was the mailbag, so maybe you're able to talk to five readers or whatever a day or whatever, you know what I mean? Or then even the boards. We, you know, we see it already on our KindaFunny.com/Forum, uh, where, you know, you go in to do this, right?
