Okay, second, that's Sean Murray and this is a PS I Love You XOXO exclusive where we're just talking about No Man's Skies and I just saw the demo and man, isn't amazing. I cannot wait. And three, we saw a quick demo where it was just basically exploration. Yeah, and I've been since E3 have been so excited for that that's I I was thinking as I like what would I want more and it's just like I really was just super psyched and excited to explore the vastness of space that you're created. But now I see you've got NPCs and you can go into the buildings and go into the ship's I can't wait now that's also I mean what we've been trying to show people and want what we kind of haven't shown before we've done things like like E3 and stuff like that and at E3 you're on stage and it doesn't actually it doesn't go down that well when I'm like let's just show off the UI and stuff like that",
