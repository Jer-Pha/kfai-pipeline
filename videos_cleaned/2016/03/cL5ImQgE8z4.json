Yeah, but but you're not fat. I know, but I'm not thin. I'm also not you're not not fat. I'm I'm not not fat, that is for sure, right? And I feel like as my life has progressed, I've only gotten more not not fat, right? You got further away from skinny but not fat, closer to fat. A big thing for me is I I realized, you know, it's it's not until you look at old pictures of you or in this case, old videos of you, you're like, oh, ****, like I looked like that. And then the crazy part is I remember how I felt at that moment and feeling like I was not not fat then, you know what I mean? And I I remember being like, you know, not thrilled about my my body image at that point. And now I'm like, well, ****, compare this to this and it's like that's if this guy if that guy could think about this guy, he'd be appalled, you know, and I feel",

But you keep let that way I just keep letting it cuz it's fun and cuz I enjoy it. Sure. I like food. I like not doing things. Yeah, so it's like it's it's hard, sure. But I'm also comfortable with it. So that's the thing. I think that's the thing finding your comfort level. So I'm it's just it's hard for me to wrap my head around people enjoying exercise. But as I get older, I feel more and more people do. Like they genuinely enjoy running or genuinely enjoy doing this. I'm not talking about people that are into sports. They're into sports.

And unless you're that obscene Alfredo level of like I like looking good this is my the point of my existence. Sure. Like just being a normal **** like one of us, I can't imagine enjoying doing that stuff, you know? Like there's the kids back in high school that did the track and field and like cross country FS. Yeah, whatever. Let's go run in the woods. They grew up and who knows what the **** they're up to, but they're weird. They're the weird. Agreed. Agreed. But uh I'm talking about the normal people like us. What are we supposed to do, man? Am I supposed to not enjoy ice cream?
