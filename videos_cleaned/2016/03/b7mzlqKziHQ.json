As always, I'm Tim Gettys, joined by the coolest dudes in video games, Colin Moriarty and Greg Miller. And for the first time ever, that beautiful bastard over there in the cool jacket. I want one of those cool jackets. He's too stylish. We have Al White. Hey. Yay. Al White, of course, friend to all. Of everyone? Of everyone. Of all people? A community member for a long time. You came into my life when we were working at IGN. You had this film called Spider-Man Eclipse. Yeah, don't remind me of that. What do you mean? What? Fucking hate it. You were not allowed to say that. Why do you hate it? It's the least favorite thing I've ever done in my entire life, but it opened my stores. And it got you, you met us. Yep. And then you went off and you keep making movies. You're making all this cool stuff. You're gonna tell us about it, I'm sure. And then, of course, for some reason, you took your windfall",

It was, all right, cool, thank you. Much appreciated and unnecessary. The Spider-Man thing was really cool. You're wrong, thinking that it's bad. The Spider-Man Eclipse was great. Everybody paused this on YouTube and go watch it on YouTube. YouTube.com slash start that still exists. And the video's still there. Is that where it was on start? You're right.

FM3? Everybody Google Fran Mirabelle on Twitter and then you find him and you tweet him and you screwed over Spider-Man Eclipse. Yeah, it's true. He'll know exactly what you're talking about.

Can this stop? Oh my God. I can't believe we have this meeting. Can I just get, maybe if we like, there was Teddy when you went and laid on the couch while I was finishing emails. I probably got a good 45 minutes here, maybe 30 where I could stop doing my emails and go play, you know, like now I'll do my work. You know what I mean? Like it's under my skin that way. However, it's exactly what I thought it was going to be. This isn't like, if it's third person Destiny in a much cooler environment, I think in an awesome fleshed out world.

So we were helping him out on his missions, but then we were making him do them on hard so we would get like more of an experience, more of a challenge or whatever. And so, you know, we went in there and it was just like it was in Destiny when you'd try to do stuff that hard like that. And I didn't even get crazy about Destiny as you know, but more, I guess even more like DC Universe Online where we went in there and it was like inch by inch, like we're going in there and this guy comes out and he's like, you know, level 10 or whatever.

It was like this huge uphill climb right for this minimal gain of like maybe we got two hundred more credits, maybe a few more resources than we would have got playing on normal. But it was the fun of playing with your friends and going through and doing that. And then, you know, the opposite of that is like, you know, I, you know, we work a bit earlier than our friends who are at home from work or have dumb kids and families have to see. And so, like when I Joe on there and I'm all alone, it's like, okay, cool. Now I'm just going to go. Oh, there's an encounter over there. I'll go and gauge that encounter. Oh, I need some resources.

I don't it's not like I'm not getting the last of a story out of it. I you know, I've I've fallen through the world. Brendan fell through the world last night. Like there's little things like that.

I've been thinking about it quite a bit to me because I always I think I have quite a lot of problems with Division, but I think the problems I have more come from me and how I'm kind of changing as I get older and what I want from a video game. I used to always wanted that MMO. I mean, I'm a console player, not a PC gamer at all.

And it looked gorgeous. And and it was one of the games I was really anticipating coming out. And then when the graduates came out, you start seeing the beta let's plays and just watch, you know, I watched a lot. I spent a lot of hours watching people play stuff while I'm doing stuff. And it's just something in the background. I kind of take it in, you know, by osmosis. And I there was nothing in it. I had no point that I really understand what the point was.

Like, I thought it was going to be quite loose. Like it does. It's much closer to how satisfying that sort of cover combat and Gears of War and things are. But the difference is like I really I really cherish narrative and story. And I think the world's beautiful in Division. It's really gorgeous. And the let's plays I had didn't really showcase really how beautiful it looks when you actually get it. Especially as like the sun goes down or whatever, the light bounces off buildings. Yeah.

And admittedly, I'm not playing it with anybody else. You know, I can see some idiots running around and doing jumping jacks and stuff and like kind of destroying the occasional immersion I'm getting in the game. But it was literally, you know, I mean, I only played two and a half hours, but I'm running somewhere. I turn a corner. That little voice pops in saying, oh, enemies are approaching. Well, OK, I'll shoot them and turn the next corner. Enemies are approaching. All right. I'll duck down and shoot them. And and it's satisfying combat, but it's just not it.

It does play quite a lot like Gears to me. And I'm interested when Gears comes back at the end of this year, if people are going to give a shit anymore, like because it's you know, it's a tentpole game and it really fell off the ledge a little bit.

Like this is that was like one of the first things that hit me. I'm like, why is this design like this?

It's fun to play a role playing game that, you know, where where numbers are popping out of enemies as you're shooting them, as opposed to slashing them or shooting them with arrow, whatever, using guns. I also think that it's really bold that the game takes place in New York City. And I I I it takes I don't think people look at it, especially maybe younger people, but like it's it's kind of still faux pas and a lot of ways to go in New York City and destroy it like that after what happened in 9-11.

You're a man alone. And I like that. Like that. That definitely is probably the coolest part of the game is like I'm just slinking around. No idea what the fuck's going on around me.

So or this game seems to be maybe five 10 hours in it totally changes. But I really doubt it. Well the end game where it'll be the real test to see what it is because that was the same with DC right? You could play DC all by yourself until you wanted to. You got to level 30 and Destiny with the raids. So so I'm intrigued. I do think that they they did a nice job.

You know or is it just something you just play and that's experience and I think that but that's what games are more more so now than they've ever been. You don't beat games you just kind of play them until you're done playing them. They beat you. Yeah I think I think that that I mean I agree with you in a sense. That's actually I mean I'm being facetious but it's true. It's like the some of these games beat me or I'm like fuck this. You know like I can't I don't even dislike this.

Cause PS came out in 11th grade where I played a lot of Japanese role playing games and I had a ton of them. I used to buy like so many games. And one of the qualities that looked at was length. Like I would read PSM or go online and read IGN or whatever and be like yeah that's great. The game the kind of like how long is Legend of Legaia? How long is Xenogears? Like I for some reason I was obsessed with this like this notion that the length meant quality at some point. And it's not true. Xenogears for instance is an incomplete game. The games rush.

And and so I look at these games now and I'm like I understand that perspective but I do think it's overwhelming gaming culture where it's like well how big is it? You know like the value is is garnered from how big the game is. Gone Home is $0 whatever but Gone Home's experience is worth $60 in my opinion. Like that game is an hour and a half long and you can never play it again but it's way more resonant than almost anything I've played in the last few years. And so that kind of thing is in the eye of the beholder where I'm like well we look at these experience I'm not saying we should pay $60 for Gone Home.

It gave me a cry like weep like a baby you know we paid $15 for it or whatever.

So I'm more interested in seeing like what they actually mean by this. I'm fascinated by the idea. That's, you know, top of the line. I just, right now as dumb Greg Miller, who doesn't understand business or hardware, I can't wrap my head around it in the way of, yeah.

Which to me personally as a consumer is fucking terrifying because every single problem that I have in my life to do with gaming is because they're all fucking online.

So it's it's it's amazing like how much that game sold how much that paid off for them to just treat it with a little bit of care. Do you think because the publishers won't be there though E3 it's going to change with us on the show floor because I was talking about this with a bunch of my friends who you know we're going to this company and it's a bunch of them are coming with us for the first time ever to E3 and they're reading all this stuff and they're like",

Why do we go to this? It's not comprehensive anymore. You know it's like you want to go there and know that somewhere on the floor there's almost everything you want to find. You know like do you think a lot of those games aren't going to be represented?
