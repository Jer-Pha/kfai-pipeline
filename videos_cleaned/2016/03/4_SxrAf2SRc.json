It's a live event at 7:00 p.m. Pacific that's going to reveal the release date of the game finally, along with a whole bunch of cool stuff. It's all going to be streamed, so make sure you come support us live for all the news, excitement, and shenanigans. Greg, yeah, topic three, we're doing something a little bit different today. That's right. I'm a very big fan of like Dimensions. I don't know if I've told you about this a couple times. Lots. I was super... There are a lot of Let's Plays here on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames. So Wave Four just came out. Wave Five is in May, but that's all we know. Okay, so I wanted to grab somebody over there at TT Games, hug them tight, thank them for making the game, and then ask him what the **** comes next. And so when I said that, a whole bunch of people turned me down, but Mark Warburton, he accepted the challenge to come in, talk about what's happening, what the hell's going on, and",

Mark, my close personal friend Mark. We follow each other on Twitter. I think we met once at Comic-Con during the Doctor Who event. You think? See, I met a lot of people. Let's see the interview. Roll the clip, Kevin. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm here with the one and only Mark Warburton. Hi, Mark. Hello. How are you, my good man? I'm excellent. How are you? Not too bad, not too bad. It's the end of our day here, so I'm looking forward to just putting my feet up and trying to relax for the rest of the evening. Understandable. It's an understandable move. You should do that. But first, I have to give you the whole rundown of Lego Dimensions. I don't know if you're aware, I'm a big Lego Dimensions fan. Are you aware of this?

It's been uh it's been really nice to have such a big fan in our corner, so thank you very much for that. No, yes, congratulations. Good job on the game. It's been a huge pain in my ass for my wallet, so I want to yell at you for that to start with. But I I'm still mystified, not mystified I guess, because I get it, but it's so surprising that it caught me that I got the bug for Lego Dimensions, 'cause really I'd never given toys-to-life any kind of cred. I you know, I I played Disney Infinity here, saw this with Skylanders. I respected what they were doing, but I knew they weren't for me.

But then I sat down and played it, and you know, at demos, then you had you guys over, and then when I got the final version, you there's so much fan service in this game. Thank you so much for making it. No, no, it was it was a pleasure. I mean, that that's the key. It was always going to be a game about fan service. I mean, we're fans. That that's the key key to everything we do. We love these properties. We we love Ghostbusters and Superman, and we grew up with them. Like Doctor Who, I I grew up watching Doctor Who, so to actually get to make a game about it, play around in that world is an incredible honor. And which just so much fun.

I mean, because I've talked about the game, people seen the Let's Plays, all that different stuff. For me, with Lego Dimensions, and having you in this this opportunity, thank you so much for your time. Um, what is it doing for you guys? I'm not looking for sales numbers, but I mean, is it is it exceeding what you expected it to do? Because it was coming up on it, there was already that conversation of like, well, there's already so many things vying for the toys-to-life market. Can this one survive? And it seems like it's done well when I see NPD or I see numbers. We we we unbeliev... Oh, I can't even get my words out. Happy about it. We happy.

This is something a little bit different from what what we're used to. And then you start interacting a little bit more and more people start talking about it to you. I was just great. It it it's been a continuous exceeding of expectations for us, and we're so happy that we've got to go on this journey and continue with it. So with what's happened, and I guess, you know, it finding an audience, it doing all these different things, has it changed the course of TT Games?

Is is that is that me being newbie and not understanding the business? Is there really conversations like that that happen? No, I mean, you know, I think you're right to ask that question. Um, but really, it's not really something that we'd discussed as such. Um, our business has always been those core titles. I mean, we've got Star Wars: The Force Awakens coming out this year, which they dropped a trailer for today, and it looks great. Um, and those are things we always continue to do. Uh, we did Avengers earlier on in the year, which was another Arthur Parsons game, which we was really, really pleased of. I loved it to bits.

Lego Dimensions, it it was a new thing for us, you know, technology, toys-to-life, completely different brands across the world. We had the opportunity to do that, and we can continue doing the games we've always done. People love at the same time. It's it's a really good position that we put ourselves in. So going forward, is it so now that Star Wars, you're doing this, you're back with Star Wars, which is crazy. I thought I never thought I'd see that happen. When you guys announced that, I was like, I did not see that one coming. Is it one of those that then as the one of the Lego Dimensions guys, do you then look at that and then start trying to figure out if you want to do a a world for them, a dimension for them, some kind of level pack or whatever?

I mean, that that's kind of I I love games, and I was a big fan of TT Games before I even joined the company. So when these games start being developed, I really try and stay away from the ones I'm not working on. I I oh, just no. Like when when Arthur Parsons was doing Avengers, I could see it in the corner. I was like, just no, turn it off. I don't want to. I want to see when it's finished, and I can sit down and enjoy them playing. It's the same with Star Wars. I can I can see them developing it, and it's just like, that looks great. Don't show it me. I want to be a fan. I want to enjoy it like everybody else.

It's a real symbiotic relationship that we've got going on. It's it's a lot of fun. You're dodging questions, Mark. What is next for Lego Dimensions? That's what I'm asking. I want to know how you get what happens with these level packs. You just put out Wave Four. All we know after this is Wave Five with Slimer. What like what happens next, God damn it? Well, uh, let's see. Lord Vortech goes on the holiday. I think I might join him. No, you know what? I obviously, we we've said from the off, we don't want this to be a one-shot thing.

We want something that is under your TV and stays there for a long, long time, and we can keep adding on and putting more content on whenever we want and whenever we see fit. That's, you know, why we've got the upgrade. We've got the download system. We we did everything we could so we can continue to add to the experience as much as we possibly want to and can. And that's certainly something that people will see in the coming months. And that's I what I liked a lot about it when you guys came out, you know, and you were talking about Lego Dimensions.

You wouldn't need to get something else. So clearly, you guys are invested in the future. Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, it was always about trying to develop the technology that lived up to that vision. Uh, in a way, you know, we tried as as best we can. I think we succeeded in making everything that we needed in that hardware to last us for a long, long time. That was very important.

You're sitting there, you can is it literally anything? Do you come up with? I like, and I know you can't talk about going forward, but in let's look backwards, right? In terms of what you've done, when you you have The Simpsons and you have uh The Wizard of Oz, and Grant said, I think, you know, the superheroes are a bit easier because their relationship and everything else.

Yeah, I mean, it's really, it doesn't feel real still when you think of who we've actually got. Um, yeah, you know, the Doctor Who one was a huge thing for for me personally as well. Uh, I think personally, when we talk to them, we've got 11 years worth of games behind us now. You know, it's it's 11 years since the original Lego Star Wars came out, and tell me about it. Um, although I I seem to be aging faster than some of the people who actually worked on that game, which is um, but yeah, so people know what we're about.

We're not going to make Batman do something he he would never in a million years do in a comic book or something like that. It'll be funny, it will be cheeky, but it pays respect to the brand. So when we go into these meetings with someone we've never worked before, that likes of Fox or Sony or someone like that, we can say, look, this is what we're about. These are the games we make, and these are the games we want you to be a part of. Do you want to come on this ride with us?

Everyone's heard of Lego. Everyone stepped on it in the middle of the night and cursed it. No, I have. Um, but it's great. It's just anything you can make anything out of Lego, and it just becomes something fun and unique, and that's what's great about it. And we can take things like The Simpsons or Back to the Future, which you never see together in the same game. Soon as it's in Lego form, it just works and makes sense. Yeah, it does.

Were you aware you were getting in that, or is that just the natural progression of what the Lego community already was, and I just was ignorant to?

And if you don't have it, you can't use it until it seemed like you guys responded and put that in there. Is that how it happened? Yeah, so I mean, we we had considered it during development. We we considered something along those lines, and it had been sort of paper written down. And then the community spoke. They they sort of said what they liked about the game, didn't like. So we reacted accordingly. There's no point in working on something we intend, as we said before, for many, many years, if people are really saying they're unhappy with",

We can make alterations and make people as happy as they can be. Is that like the benefit you think to building a platform rather than the game this time around? Absolutely, yeah, without a doubt. We we can constantly look at it and see exactly what's going on. We can see what people are saying about it, if they're having problems or they're getting stuck. I mean, you know, at games, people still hit issues, and we've got to address that. We've got to really make it the most seamless experience it possibly can be.
