What are your names? So I'm Robert Koni, a producer on Turtles at Activision, and this is Adosama, the director of the game from Platinum Games. Thank you very very very much for joining us. So I'm very excited about this. Last time I saw you was back at E3 when we were talking about Transformers Devastation, which was awesome. If you're a fan of Transformers, specifically the '80s one, G1, it was spectacular. Then all of a sudden, this trailer comes out for Ninja Turtles and I'm like, \"Oh man, they're doing it. They are doing it. They're doing exactly what I want.\" And here it is. We get to play it for the first time. I'm very excited about this. Let's do it. I'm already stoked that there's a multiplayer option. So is that a local couch co-op? Actually, it's uh four player online. So we actually",

So we actually really wanted to do local couch co-op, but the problem is if you do, then you have to split the screen and suddenly your 60 fps situation gets a lot worse and it also starts limiting technically the things you can do. So um we had to go with online only but it's four players though in all four turtles. Yeah, exactly. Right. Of course, it's the only way to go. All right. So we got Nick Nick playing. He's going to try it out and if he if he if he's not up to snuff, we'll have to get the pros to come in. We'll see how we do this. We'll see how we do. So you don't need to worry about this too much. I'll walk you through it. So perfect. But uh all right. So this is a Platinum Games game. Oh actually, we can watch the cut. Yeah, watch. Yeah, let's enjoy this. What's wrong? Oh yeah.",

Oh yeah. Sorry. Get a little closer to it. There you go. Now, you know, I had to go with my boy Leo. Mhm. But I like how the turtles have distinctive differences as far as body and like faces. Well, that's so what's cool about this is it's based on the IDW comic series going on right now, which I am a huge fan of. Do you read it? Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I know. Good. The guy that wrote the story, Tom Walt, the guy that wrote IDW, Tom Waltz, wrote the story. That's awesome. You can tell by the designs of their their bandanas. Each one kind of has a unique thing.

Would stop him or party with him depending on what he's up to. He might not be breaking the law this time. He might have just gotten out of jail and said, \"You know what?

This is awesome. So uh you can also swap turtles at any time in single player by holding L2 and then pressing any of the D-pad buttons. So like there you go. Oh wait. Oh what's up? You just won. Yeah, I did. Intro mission. Crushes it. Cool. Yeah. So um you know, the game really is Oh sorry. The game is all about um teamwork. That's like one of the big focuses they had this time around.

Um a great example of this is Michelangelo's cheerleader move. Um so if you if you switch to actually I think uh if you press R1 and press right maybe uh sorry down maybe it's up very cool. Uh so oh he can't use it yet but when when it comes off a cool down um he basically grabs pom poms and just starts cheering. Um and when he does that it actually resets the cool downs of every other character. So kind of you want to coordinate with your team, have them blow like all of their cooldowns and just kick a bunch of ass and then they come and then you use cheerleader and they can do it all again, right? So there's a lot of moves in the game like that where it really enforces teamwork. Um and then if you're playing single player, you don't have",

So you actually end up managing four sets of cool downs. Um and all those all those abilities that you have, you can assign however you want. Mhm. So there's a ton of um for lack of a better term, builds that you can do um for both your entire team and individual turtles depending on if you're playing single or multiplayer. That was actually a Michelangelo's co we call it a co-op move where like if you start there's a certain move called a combo attack. If you start it and then another turtle next to you also does the same move, then it becomes like this superpowered move. Um and depending on the turtle that's doing it, it's a different one. So",

Um which is not only hilarious, but it's also incredibly powerful because uh if you hit an enemy who's dancing, it's treated like a we call it a stealth takedown. So you can basically one-shot any regular enemy and do tons of damage to a boss. That's really cool. What's this R3 T-glass thing? So that is um actually it's a Donnie invention. Um but if you press it, it'll show you uh like the direction of your current goal. It'll give you like a ping and you can just follow the ping and then you can also see where enemies are, etc. and how far away your teammates are.

You can have up to four items at once. um some of them are like really strong and it's actually especially if you play harder difficulties, it's a major aspect of um being able to succeed in difficult boss fights because there's things like for example turrets that you can place that just shoot everything in sight and they do a ton of damage for a short period of time. Well if all four turtles drop one of those at once, it's really significant amount of damage, right? So and then there's things that there's speed drinks, there's uh power drinks, there's bombs that are gravity bombs that suck all the enemies in. There's ones that freeze everyone on the screen.

I got to give the world a little Donatello right now. Oh yeah. See how this bow staff out for a little test drive. Yeah. So I like the the weapons have the different glowing. Is that because you want to be able to keep track of your character as there's a bazillion things on screen? Actually the glowing is um when the turtles are all together, they actually do more damage. So that's what it's signifying. So that means everybody's close enough to each other to get that bonus.

See if you can find anything. There's probably some stuff you can get. Sweet. Um but yeah, so the team is actually a mix of Transformers, Bayonetta, um Team Rising, Metal Gear Rising. Awesome. Very cool. So it's it's it's a pretty good mix. Actually, Platinum does that on almost all their games. They kind of it's not like they have a this is the Bayonetta team, but it's like they just recreate teams based on the needs of the project every time. So that's awesome.

So that cheerleader thing I was talking about for Mikey only he can use that. Um the thing where you slow down time that's Leonardo's special one. Um you can do huge amounts of damage with it. Um Raphael actually has the ability to um become stealthy for like a significant period of time. Trench coat. No that would be that would be ideal. Um and then Donnie actually has like a healing move where he can actually revive all of his teammates instantly as well as heal everybody. Cool.

Um Raph is a little bit slower, but he does a lot more damage with each hit. And then Leo is kind of a well-rounded character who can kind of he has he has decent area of effect attacks. Um but and more of a medium range. So I've been playing Ninja Turtle games since I've been playing video games and Dantel has always been the go-to because of that. I want him to die. Rough can die and it doesn't really really matter too much. He's in the room. Is that true in this game or you can still hear him?

So certain abilities work really well um for certain characters. Go toward the steam. But it's really designed for all of the characters to be used at the same time. So it's not like um they they tried to make sure that it didn't end up that way. And in fact, Shaman could probably talk more of that but um they wanted to make sure that all of them were relatively equivalent in power and wouldn't have that situation where everybody's just dying to play Donnie. You know what I mean? Um so all of them definitely have um very powerful. Can I ride on these things? You totally can. Oh no. So that was actually one of the big things they've done in this game.

Um there's a lot of things to pick up. Um actually let me talk about that for a second. So actually the concept between each stage is it's kind of old school. They they took took a a page from old school arcade games, I guess. Um each stage is really just a huge buildup to the boss, right? So like it constantly builds up like the stages are named after bosses, not after locations. So this is the Bebop stage.

But the better you do in the parts before the boss, um the more advantages you gain for the actual boss fight. All right so one of these days I'm going to figure out how to dodge that electrical current going through the electrical lines. Um in the first trailer was put out, there was like a subway train that we saw and there was like the little little token looking things.

So if you see the latest trailer that just came out like a couple days ago, um there were some some that were newly shown. I think they were previously hinted at like uh Karai for example um was newly shown in this last trailer. Um and she's like she's a ninja and she moves just like one. She does you get to see some of her cool moves, but she's super fast. Um and really keeps you on your toes.
