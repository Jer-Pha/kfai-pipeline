It was given to you by TT Games when you won Friendly Game of the Year 015. Correct. I still do. Here he is. But this means that this Superman can now go live permanently with the other Supermen out on my little Superman sanctuary whereas this can be the Superman that forever lives in my toy box. This is angry Superman. He's angry. You can rotate their heads. And this is regular Superman. It's very cool. That's one of the cool things you can do with Lego Dimensions is to make their faces different. So when you're like are you mad bro? Yeah exactly. Yes he is. You can do it with Wonder Woman too.

What's happening is today we're gonna play and unbox all these Lego Wave 4 guys and play the Midway Arcade level. However then you're gonna hop over to Stimer's channel youtube.com slash stimer and see a free roam play of the Midway Arcade world.

I feel like we burn a lot of time in the less plays of the new waves building the vehicles. Okay. You know what I mean? So we're not gonna do that? Like building the terror dog. Should we? Superman we're not even gonna unbox. Okay. Because he's been unboxed. There he is. Later I will unbox this one to get his little car and be all set. Which is of course the hover pod. Which you know Superman needs. Out of all yeah he really can't. He can't do anything else. You know he's grounded. Yeah. You want to build the terror dog maybe?
