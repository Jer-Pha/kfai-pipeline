I'm pretty excited about this, Kevin, because here's a thing, if there's one thing I know about you and me, it's that we're the very best like no one ever was. Well, we're going to, we've been playing a couple practice rounds here and let me tell you something, we ain't good at this game, not at all. It's very intricate. There's a lot of, there's phases that you can do. There's battle phases and stuff. So I thought, you know what's the best thing to do when you don't know how to play a game? Let's do a tournament, me and you, one-on-one. I'm ready, Pokemono eono. So we're going to get right into this. We're going to go over to local battle mhm and we're going to play. So what's cool is it's kind of this this not isometric but uh behind the camera point of view going on. I get to see on the the gamepad, you get to see on this.

You going straight to Pikachu Libre unless you want to take, no, that's a solid choice, solid choice. You you you were playing with him, killing with him in the battle. He destroyed my G damn good. He's damn good. Um, I'm going to, I'm going to go big from the beginning. Let's start with the Zard. A support set is always a tough choice, isn't it? So you can choose these support set Pokemon. So it's kind of like Marvel versus Capcom where they they kind of pop in and stuff. Um, I'm going to go with this just for the the comedic value. Um, we see the little flag SC.

There's obviously the ranged attacks, there's more combo attacks. All right, it's me it looking good. Yeah, this is the game that I've wanted since I was eight years old playing playing Pokemon. This important who you going to choose? Um, I already got this. Oh, you okay, I messed that up. Yeah, talk **** get shot. They look exactly the same. I get it. I get it. Okay, so let's start this one off right. Yep, so you know that played me in Super Smash Brothers. That's move you're familiar with that move. I call it thear, not sure what it's actually called in Pokemon turn. Oh, I enjoy this game so much even though the controls make no sense to me.

No. Well, we played like five minutes and then we got bored because you know now I want to say you were completely destroying me a second ago. Yeah, I know you beat me by so much you you didn't have your best showing there. So then you get these points for your trainer comes out kind of Cheers you on and then your support gauge goes up. Your support gauge is for these guys right here to be able to pop out. Um, now I tried to get them to pop up but they didn't come up this round. It's cuz your support gauge wasn't full still not walk that cuz I was looking at your support Gates. Uh, uhoh, what's that? Oh, oh man, it's super effective. Ah, do you see me just come at you with a flying kick? Damn, you're getting me. Oh, oh my God, there we go. Mega Charizard no no no no hold him off",
