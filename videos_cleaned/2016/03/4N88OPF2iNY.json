You guys caught like the the explosion. I was living I was living down the hallway from him of just him. I was a city away and I heard him. He was in the living room down.

Yeah, also remember when you said it was two words. Two words. Here's one word. Here's a bunch of other words. And then he's like, I got to think of one point word. You yeah, did work out. Oh, the **** best. I love this show. See how much of this how much you how much you text him last night. He asked me if we needed a Schedule C, which we don't need a Schedule C.

You know, we are in a certain tax bracket with not a lot of write-offs and we're in a specific area where we can't own a home, a piece of property, which would be a major write-off for us. The government just goes, hey, I'm going to take your pants down. Oh, I'm not going to suck on it. I'm going to flip you over and just cram my hand up your ass and take whatever I want from you and just pull it out and leave you with like a dangly mess of inerts that should be yours are hanging out of your ass.

Wish I knew how to change it and fix it, but I don't think there's any fix in it. It's the way it is at least right now. It's like I can't get out of it unless I become an illegal **** and I ain't trying to do that. Colin, well, you can because you're a natural born citizen. No, I know. Not that type of illegal. I'm talking about like if I was like just not a Wesley Snipes character. You mean so not an illegal person in the United States. You mean you're going to live illegally by not paying your taxes.

I still don't I can't wrap my head around this expensing thing. You don't have to worry about it. So so that's the thing. Like people always tell me save every all your receipts. Save them in an envelope. I save a bunch of receipts and then the time comes. I'm like, I ask you ****. Do I need anything? You're like, oh no, you don't need them. I'm sorry. I apologize. So so the reason why you're able to write some of your expenses off is because you have miscellaneous 1099 income. So anything you got paid by we have a company, right? The four of us and sometimes five, Kevin. That company pays us a salary in which taxes are taken out of. So you don't have to worry about anything if we just",

But because our lives are ridiculous and people will just come out of the woodwork and be like, hey, come down to LA and be in a VO booth for a couple hours and pretend like you're working hard. It'll go down there and work hard. But I'm just, you know, they're going to give you a 1099. And what that means is that's that's miscellaneous income outside of what you made on the company. You are allowed to expense some receipts based on that work that you did through them. So not a lot. But if you went down there for instance and the company said we're not sending",

Well, that's $500 then is money that you had to put toward getting that job. So theoretically, an obvious consultant accountant, they'll tell you whether or not this is this is true or not or she will. Um, or she will. Uh, our accountant just happens to be male. Actually, there's male and a female. So that both we work with work. Um, Tony is our accountant. Yeah, Tony actually is our accountant, which is crazy 'cause he's not making ill beats or graphically designing ****. He's a Certified Public Accountant. Um, so that's why you're able to do it. So if you have and you have to make more than I think a certain like I think you have to make more than $500 to even show up on that radar. Is it $500 or is it closer to like $1,000 'cause I",

Okay, so so if you if you like for instance, we have some people who have done some work for us that I have 1099, but they've only we've only paid them a couple hundred bucks. We don't claim that. That just gets claimed on a different category. So they don't have to worry about paying taxes on anything under than $500. So let's say let's say that I I just had this normal **** and I had one thing that was $501 or whatever just right above the that number is right. Yeah, you're is it even worth doing expenses for that or is it just 'cause that seems like such a low a threshold? It's probably not.

I thought you were talking about write-offs because your minimum deduction is $6,300, I think. So like if your deductions all don't reach $6,300, it doesn't matter that you did your deductions because they're not allowed. They're not going to take them anyway, right? So like I think that's the the some people should look it up. They know take tax advice for me, but I think that's what it is. I'm I like so I can't write off my student loans anymore because we made too much money. Like because I because people have to understand that like we're an S corporation. So the passive income in in the bank that we have, we each have to split by the shares that we owe, which means I owe money on on taxes on money I don't even have, right? So when I",

So when I said my number that I like that they'd already taken me plus what I have to write them a check for now, it was it is an extraordinary amount of money. Like it is an unfathomable amount of money that I owe them. But to be fair, that's because we chose as a business to keep that money there so that we could do things like pay Kevin, um, buy equipment, things like that. So if at the end of the year we decided, hey, **** it, we don't want to run this anymore. We want to tap the the savings account, then you would that that imbalance would be a little less. It's still painful as **** 'cause there still there's still, you know, whatever money this is the problem.

And it sucks. It sucks having that feeling. It's very stressful. It's very stressful in a relationship. But I think the the ultimate thing was she was just like, look, this is just the way it is. And the goal is to eventually have some write-offs and make a little bit more money and maybe, you know, skimp back on some stuff. Like maybe I don't need to go to Starbucks five times a day, which you know what she doesn't know can't hurt me. All right, Tim. No, you bought coffee pods. Don't don't be. I did.

I'm trying to switch to decaf as well 'cause my overall anxiety level has risen in the last two months and I read that caffeine does not help that exacerbates that.

No, again, if anyone's out there listening and you're there are probably some accountants that are pulling their hair out thinking we got everything wrong. Please go to an accountant. Do not take what we're saying by any stretch of the imagination is fact. Go get someone who has a degree in this to tell you whether or not you can do these things. I mean, I don't think we said anything that no, I just want to make sure people don't go, oh, I'm going to write my car off right now. And then the goes, well, that's their problem.

It doesn't make any sense. We shouldn't be writing off anything. Like this is this is the thing. It's like, why do we even employ anyone at the IRS? Why can't we just have a flat **** tax? I don't know. That would be so much easier. It would be so much easier just to play pay a flat percentage tax.
