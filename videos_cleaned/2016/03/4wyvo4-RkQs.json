I want to talk about Fuller House, but but specifically about not so much the show itself, although we can talk about the show itself if we'd like, but more about these these kind of old school things coming, not really old school, but things from our childhood coming back. Pretty old school. And if we really need it, and this was the question I was asking myself when I was watching Fuller House, because I only made it through two episodes where I'm like, this is just **** terrible.

I was playing Vita and then I jumped to the Hunter Pence episode. I was like, all right, cool. I've done my due diligence or whatever and I've seen Hunter, our boy, so I can move on. And I was like, this is this is bad. But Full House was always bad. Yeah, but of course, the I mean, that's that doesn't matter because the context is different. We were kids when we saw these and so we have um, different memories and different ideas of what Full House really was. And uh, also it was kind of a kid show back then, right?

Like we don't even yeah, and this is what I'm wondering because this isn't kind of exclusive to Full House and Fuller House. I mean, The X-Files, not that I was an X-Files fan, but The X-Files came back and apparently is atrocious. Um, the uh, you know, we're gonna get Twin Peaks back and that was like really tortured and stuff like that. And Baywatch is coming back and all this.

The last show, the last episode, I think was when Michelle got like thrown off her horse and like had like amnesia and **** like that. You guys remember that episode? Oh, there's always an amnesia episode. So like, and I think they kind of just ended suddenly. And so this was like a nice way for them never got her memory back. This is a nice way for them to like kind of bring it all uh, full circle and like just see what all the characters doing. It's interesting. I mean, The Brady Bunch did this and stuff. L did this.

If they would have just done that because it was all the people you cared about, right? And like, okay, Joey works in Vegas and this is happening and Danny and Rebecca are moving down to LA to host that show and da da da.

Um, and I do respect that they were just like these kid these guys were babies back in the day and we just brought them in and like we'll sit them backs to the camera cause they can't act. They're awful actors. It will make their characters totally stupid. Return to the twins makes it sound way more epic than I'm assuming it was.

They couldn't come back for the going away party because they, you know, are busy in New York running their fashion line. And then they all or what her, I guess. And then they all look at the camera and like hold it and the audience goes crazy and stuff. Like they all break the fourth wall for it.

It's very much like where with Entourage, it's one of those things where at least it's not that far removed. I don't think where like Entourage ended maybe five, six years ago.

This is pure fan service. And that's what Fuller House is, right? Like there's a lot of fans out there that just wanted to see them get back together. What I don't I'm not sure there was.

Both of those were actually relatively entertaining movies, whereas Fuller House is literally just a continuation of the series where I don't I think there's maybe only one series that has done it well.

But again, that's taking it and kind of still turning it on side of like saying like, we're going to pull the curtains back. We're going to show you behind the scenes of this whole thing being made.

It's telling them don't take me to yeah, it's it it begs the question of like, can something can a situational comedy like that produced by Netflix really have that market penetration, right? Because that's not typically like what people go to Netflix for. But I mean, I think I mean, I think uh, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt did, right? Like that did well.

Yeah, Colin's favorite. Well, that's what I'm saying. Oh God, that joke show sucks. Unequivocal about that. But like all those shows you just named are shows that use the medium for what it for all of its virtues, right? Like a show can go a little raunchier. It can go a little crazier. Like they can go they don't have to be 30 minutes and they're done. They can do they they have more flexibility in the storytelling, whereas I feel like Fuller House was just literally an idea that two people thought was really funny over lunch and just **** material.

You forget that cause I blocked out a lot of Full House memories. Yeah, I did. I did like, you know, there were parts where I was I was like in the in the first episode where I was kind of laughing aloud to myself like, this is funny.
