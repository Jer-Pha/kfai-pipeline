Um if I was Colin I would start this topic off by saying, \"So, I read an article.\" But instead, I'm going to start this off by saying my girlfriend talked to me about a documentary based on a book that she watched and I'm going to present some things to you. It's called Freconomics. I don't know if you guys have heard of it before or seen it or watched it or anything. Um and it's it's kind of like a look at how random things relate to other things, right? And uh there there was one things she was telling me about there's like sumo wrestlers and they did a study on the win to lose rates and like they ended up finding out like some crazy underground black market of sumo wrestling bets going on that actually affected the win to to loss ratio or whatever. She was then talking to me about the Zika",

There's mosquitoes transmitting diseases and they're like this affects babies. Do not have babies. If you're having a baby, do not come to Brazil. So, this made me start thinking in my **** up head. I'm like, \"All right, how would that affect us?\" Because this is a really fascinating kind of concept, right, of just like things affecting other things, even though it's like hard to prove they're related, but there's just cause and effects, right? The butterfly effect. Yes. So, I was like, stress and effects.

So So you're not allowed to have babies, right? That's like, all right, fine. if that were to happen. My thoughts are, what effects would that have on the future?

There's the second graders and there's the fourth graders, but there's no third graders, which also means there's no third graders. But what if someone skipped a grade? One third grader. education. I think we can all agree there would probably be way fewer third graders. That's true. Yeah, that you're talking about the future. I'm more and Colin before you go answer me this cuz and then come back and talk about it. I'd be more interested in the immediate effect like because they're saying the CDC is saying they're not urging you. You're saying they're saying don't have kids. No babies.

I mean, it's like I mean it's if you do this, the baby will die. Like that's that's the thing. Okay. I was going to say cuz there's no way there's no way that our entire country would agree to stop having we don't have enough we don't have enough education and enough information and enough actual birth control for that to actually ever be the case in a 318 million population. it just wouldn't happen.

But I don't think like there are there are parts of Europe and there are parts of um that you hear about that people just aren't having kids and the economy is dying. So there probably would be a little bit of an impact to the economy but not much cuz it's just one year, right? Like you're missing out on an entire generation of people. That year keeps moving. So it keeps having different effects, right? cuz yeah, you don't have third graders one year, but then there'll be a year where there's no no sophomores in high school, you know, like how is that different?

Well, we don't have a hu we don't have an overpopulation problem in this country though. But in other countries that did, it would probably help because it would it would decrease the amount of uh aid that was coming from the government and probably stoke the economy a little bit.

I mean there's cut offs and whatever but we fudge the cutouts cut offs a bit to make it where the you know grades three and four are smaller classes because technically they moved it around where four all these kids should be fourth graders and they're not. Yeah, that's what I'm saying as far as education is concerned like I think it would have a probably a better impact because how many times you talk to a teacher who's like I have too many students in my class like right as far as not private schools but for public schools it would probably have an actual positive impact because you'd have less kids per classroom and the kids that were there would probably get a little bit better",

Like how? There's space, but are there resources? Yeah. Even if you tried, right, there would be deficiencies in medicine and food and lots of people would die. Yeah. So, you could try to get to 5 billion, but like literally it wouldn't you couldn't get there and it would be a lot of suffering and pain on the way. Yeah. Absolutely.

But since we've like we've um we've outsmarted evolution or whatever, like we can all survive. Like population growth is just going to continue to exponentially grow over and over and over again. Um and it's uh it's a scary kind of prospect to think about the the planet in a couple hundred years cuz it's not going to take that long.
