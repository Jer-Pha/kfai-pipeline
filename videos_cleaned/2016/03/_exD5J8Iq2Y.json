There you go people know that when they have a Vita game to announce they bring it to Kinda Funny games and we'll bring it to you the people. I know your question is it going to be Cross Buy All That Jazz? They're working on all the that information. Well, you know is Fallen Legion summer of this year.

Yeah, it's it's got a great art style to it. It's got a a rocking soundtrack not to admit the first time I spent the best. I like the music already. Yeah, so that was how I chose to see that be less time to perform that Grim calculus than I care to admit the Empire gets little. Okay, here we go. So the idea is that I'm chaining together my attacks and I can't make somebody attack until they have their thing ready to go. So it's like active Time battle from Final Fantasy it's of all but tied to each character with a button. I like this. So it's also kind of similar to The Paper Mario or the Mario and Luigi series which more action RPG based right but like it's still turn based huh you run in now I get to make a decision here how do we what do we want to do? We want to Let's kidnap let's just go straight we're going to kidnap that means Dar's block 10%",
