This is the Prodigal Son, Colin Moriarty. It's good to be here with you today. It's good to be here with you too. And, Colin, this is Prey. That is Prey's back. That is 2017, not nearly the game you and I saw oh so many years ago. No, it's not too. No, it's not. What do you take away from the trailer? Uh, looks cool. Like you said, very different. Uh, less of a traditional sci-fi setting that we saw in the original Prey. People that don't know, Prey was under development. Prey 2 was on the development by Human Head Studios. It was meeting people. Try Bethesda. They acquired the IP some time ago. The game was summarily canned at some point or some reason. The game was awesome when I saw, but obviously there was problems look with it over time. When I'm the games cast first person, I always thought Mass Effect. You were jumping around, crawling",

You were jumping around, crawling around. There's aliens and a futuristic Blade Runner like set, right? Exactly. Blade Runner was a great reference. So this is way different. Seems a little more grounded, yet not so much grounded. What your approach is, what Prey's all about. So, I mean, we don't see much gameplay at all, but we see what the aesthetics and look like. And obviously the game, I think, takes a page out of the visual stylings of Dishonored, since it is from the same studio, Arkane, although a different leg of that's just right here. That I get a Dead Space feel to it, the way they talked about it, that it's a psychological drama floating through zero-G. Their trudge fighting these shadow creatures. They run at you. It seems like it won't be survival horror, but it seems like it has those underpinnings to it. Short make sense. Yeah, I",

Short make sense. Yeah, I think the game looks cool and like it's kind of refreshing to see something just a little bit different in the space, whatever. Obviously, we have a lot of first-person adventure games, a lot of first-person walking simulators and so like that. So this will obviously be way more combative, way more RPGs. You have to assume if it's within the parameters or what Prey 2 was, which I think something must be in some way. Yeah, but you know, I like that they showed this game. I mean, it's far out, still far out in space, but you know, for context, I believe it was three years ago, maybe a little bit more, that Jason Schreier, Kotaku, broke that story about Arkane Austin, so the Texas studio working on Prey. And they haven't said anything since. It's like a lot of funny stuff out there about about what happened at that time.",

It's like a lot of funny stuff out there about about what happened at that time, like where they're getting mad that was leaking. But here is the game. So they've been working on it for three plus years. Yeah, which indicates to me that it could be imminent, but soon, within the next year to 18 months. Um, and so that's pretty exciting. But I think the game will expand. Fantastic. And I like the little loop that there in the beginning here, right? Yeah, a lot of intrigue in me. It totally strikes you use that game that's going to be what's real, what's false, right? Because there's this, you keeps checking his eye. Seems like he's reliving Groundhog Day morning. Then things start to wiggle into that. Then he's got guys coming at him. His eyes, it's some kind of space psychic eye. So, you know, psychological unit or so. Yes, like the space psychiatrist. He's dealing with a space psychiatrist. Yeah, ladies.",
