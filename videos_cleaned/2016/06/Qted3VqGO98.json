What's up, guys? I'm Tim Gettys, this is Colin Moriarty, and right over here we got Resident Evil 7 Biohazard. Awesome. And in Japan, Biohazard: Resident Evil. That's awesome, man, out of left field. Yeah, I so there was a long rumors, we I had predicted that Resident Evil 7 would be at the show and come out this fall. It's going to come out a little later, it's going to come out in January. Capcom needs a little bit more time. The cool thing about this is twofold: PlayStation VR compatible from front to back, which is **** amazing. That's completely amazing. This might be really the first true AAA fleshed out campaign that we have going to play in VR. I I don't know of any other games that are going to be that are of this, you know, level, um, that are going to be fully playable. I mean, we have great looking games, but they're not",

I mean, we have great looking games, but they're not campaign based. I mean, this is going to be maybe a 10 or 15 hour game. Probably the cooler thing is that that kitchen demo that's been floating around for a long time has been an Easter egg and no one and no one had realized it, similar to PT with Silent Hills that Konami did. So, or yeah, Konami did. So what you you pointed this out to me earlier that in the the kitchen logo there's actually the VII, like, oh, Greg, I not want to take credit for that. Greg pointed that out. Yeah, that's that's awesome. Like, that's super cool. That kitchen demo was one of one of my favorite VR experiences I've ever done so far. So I'm I'm really excited that's actually a Resident Evil. Like, that's super, super cool. Um, I I'm also really excited, I was talking this on PS I Love You, that that is called Resident Evil 7, um, because I",

Um, I I'm also really excited, I was talking this on PS I Love You, that that is called Resident Evil 7, um, because I I wanted it to be Resident Evil. Wanted like, all right, let's just I want a reboot of the series to go back to its horror roots or whatever. But I think that it's smart that they're going with the seven now with what this is to to really show that this is a real full game even though it's VR. Because I think it would have been easy for a Resident Evil VR game to be like, all right, but no, this is Resident Evil 7 and the whole thing's in VR. And I think that the VR is key to going back to survival horror roots. It's like, it's a whole new way to get scared. And I think that's kind of what the survival horror, specifically Resident Evil, needs is that a kick in the ass, a new way to bring the the um the fear out of you, to bring the noise as were Bring the Noise. Uh, yeah, I think that uh, I mean, I really do",

Uh, yeah, I think that uh, I mean, I really do believe this game has been in development for a very long time, but it also seems to be heavily inspired by what horror games are doing now, which is really more about, and I don't want to say Resident Evil didn't nail ambience or anything like that back in the day because they did, but with Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6, it wasn't about ambience, it was about shooting things, it was about zombies and fear. And I'm sure that stuff's going to be in this, but this is more like PT, it seems like, where it's very environmental and and very slow and very in and uh I think that this is a um this is a a step in the right direction for Resident Evil. Resident Evil needed a shake up and uh it's been being Resident Evil has been being have t by small teams with not a lot of money like Red Barrels with Outlast, um, and everyone",

And so this is a cool step in the right direction. And I think this is really maybe the biggest shock of the entire show, not that Resident Evil 7 exists, but that it's a PSVR game. Yeah, um, you know, it's coming to Xbox One and PC as well, and you can play it without VR on PlayStation 4. I want I'm stoked about it. Love Resident Evil and not so much anym. So this will hopefully get me back into it. I'm really interested in how much it ties in with uh with one through six, cuz one through six obviously is so story based to the point of like, all right, guys, like these characters are a little too conveniently connected now. Everybody, it's just it's a little incestuous, you know. Um, I'm sure that we'll get references to to Umbrella and Wesker and this and that, but like I I wonder if that's",

Um, I'm sure that we'll get references to to Umbrella and Wesker and this and that, but like I I wonder if that's going to be more of like a completely separate thing or if it is really going to be the characters show up in our in this world. I could I could be making this up, but I think I read that it takes place before six. Um, but I don't even know like what six was about, cuz it was not my kind of Resident Evil game. So, um, so I mean, yeah, we'll find out more, but it's just cool that the Capcom's kind of taking some notes and returning back to their roots, whatever. I'm super interested to see how maybe we'll never know how this PSVR deal came about because I'm sure Sony paid for it, but this is the right game to do it with because I do think horror games specifically have are going to be really quite um like a bellwether for VR in terms of like if they're good, um, that's going to be good scary **** up",

I that's what people are looking for. It's the same way I feel about uh space shooters, um, you know, being in the cockpit or whatever. I feel like that's a natural fit for VR and I feel like this is a natural fit too. The interesting thing I want to see is like, how's combat going to play in VR? What's that going to be like? I mean, there's a lot of questions that need to be answered about this, but we have time to answer them. So yeah, definitely. And I mean, that's the other thing too with with a game like Resident Evil, like you don't necess or at least old school Resident Evil, it was the kind of more janky aiming. So it's like, I think that with a a DualShock in hand with the VR headset, I don't think that that's that bad. Like they could actually make it work. No, it should",

I just hope the enemies are to kept to a minimum on all that kind of stuff, cuz it should be of note that the kitchen demo that we played, you were strapped in a chair and you're sitting in the chair the whole time. So you're not moving around or doing any of that stuff. It was totally just looking around and scary **** happening and it's not zombies. It was it was more like, you know, scary ass Grudge creatures and ****. So right, yeah, we'll see, we'll see how it all works out. I don't think there's going to be any locomotion with VR, but I do think that, you know, so I'm sure you use your sticks, but it would be more like Rigs maybe where it was uh like you can use your head to to to use one axis and then use the sticks to kind of control movement.

Not that things are high up on radar, so doesn't really make any sense, but you understand what I mean. Mhm. Definitely, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for watching.
