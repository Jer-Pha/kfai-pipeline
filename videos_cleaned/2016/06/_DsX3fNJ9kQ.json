What's up, guys? I'm Tim Gettys, this is Greg Miller. The Xbox conference for E3 2016 just ended, so we want to tell you all about the hardware announcements that they made during the show, 'cause there was a lot. Some would say there were hella, others would say to borrow something that Nintendo doesn't want to use this year, Xbox is giving it to you. Xbox is giving it, throw them up. Great conference, and I really did like their announcements here. Here it is, the Xbox One S hardware bookending. They start with this little guy, yeah, we got One S, right? Taking a, a, you know, a thing out of Apple's book there with the smart, oh, and this too, it's very, very Apple overall with the hardware stuff, which I think is a smart move for them. This is good here, 40% smaller, that is way smaller. Yeah, it looks, it was that, it took that like little image thing that",

Yeah, it looks, it was that, it took that like little image thing that we saw to really kind of put it in perspective of how small this is compared to the into LA tonight to do all our E3 stuff tomorrow. One of the first things I want to do when I'm free is run over to the booth and see it with my own eyes, 'cause like the controller on top of it makes it look so small. Two controllers side by side, I'm like, that's perfect, that's an awesome, awesome place to put it. 90 price point ain't bad either. Yeah, I'm a little confused about when it says sharper graphics, going to be sharper. What's so hard about, but what's that, what does that like, why, how? Because graphics going to be sharper up to two terabyte internal, that's nice, cool. You like, you like terabytes? I do, I do, I like terabytes a lot. But so sharper, so okay, so the the clear picture, there you go, HDR gaming, I understand, so",

For Blu-ray and for Netflix content and stuff like that, the the games aren't going to be in 4K, so I'm a little confused of what what they mean by sharper. That seems like some because it say sharper and show a bunch of games, but really it's just going to be sharper for the the movies and the TV stuff. It doesn't matter, the things that you see will be sharper on the system. They're showing you some some Master Chief helmets and what I'm showing you things here. Well, now this is the HDR section. Look how sharper that is. Look how look how dark the darks are. Sharper, none of this matters, it's all just marketing speak. Ultra HD, you'll never know the difference. But anyway, I think the the more important thing is $300 this August and you get the the new controller with the text textured grip.",

But anyway, I think the the more important thing is $300 this August and you get the the new controller with the textured grip. That's the big part. No, the Bluetooth actually does help out because then you'll be able to link headsets, you assume, to it. Not increased range, always always good. Never been a problem for me. Yeah, Kevin, you ever had problem with your range on your Xbox One controllers? No, Kevin hasn't any problem with Xbox. Xbox One S coming at you then. Controllers, sure. After the Gears section, they started talking about, real quick, when's Xbox One S out? August. No, August 2017, 2016, 2016. We're still in this year. Uh, Gears of War 4 limited edition Elite controller, right? So they have this fancy little thing. We know that we saw it last year, controller $150. But bam, now there's blood splatters, there's little weapon pictures. Cool for people that like this. Yeah, I mean, stuff is always fun. Controllers been hard to keep in stock. I",

I'm not excited to go out and buy a Gears of War 4 Elite controller, but it's cool if you don't have one, you like Gears of War. If this was a State of Decay Elite controller, I'd be all over it, really. I'd be on top of it. Oh my God, want your little weapons on the the stick? Forget it's got my rucksack so that I can put all my things in it. You can't run with a rucksack instead, got you have a lot to learn before it. Pre-order now if you're interested in the wireless controller. Yeah, um, then more controller news. Yes, they did the little Xbox Design Labs thing, which is incredibly awesome. Yep, like as soon as they started in on this, I was like in, and especially when I I, you know, way I thought it was going to be super expensive. I said like",

I said like $100, I think, is what I thought it was going to cost. When in reality, a regular controller $70, this will be $80 to customize, and if you want to engrave it, it's an extra $10. I'm like, yep, there you go, totally really understandable pricing. Now, what's not understandable is I didn't know that they were $70 controllers standard. Yeah, that's insane. Well, you know what, you want to play the big boys, you got to buy with the big boys on, which reminds me a lot of back in the day, the uh, N64 when they did their whole little like rainbow of colors. But this obviously make your own way better, right? I think it's really smart that uh, one of the big boys is actually like, you know what, let's do this. For years, people been doing the custom stuff online. I remember I got a custom DS thing, PSP, all this stuff here, bam.",

I remember I got a custom DS thing, PSP, all this stuff here, bam, screw it. Look at that, the one thing going through the tunnel of colors, great. The interesting thing is that they're not letting you put an image on it or do, they're not going that far, you know what I mean? Or upload your own JPEG and we can put it on there however you want to and stuff. Probably a smart idea, it gets them out of copyright infringement and everything else. Yeah, you can still go to colored controllers and get that kind of thing. And yes, there'd be penises on controllers. But no, I'm I'm I keep refreshing Xbox.com today, not looking for anything there. Now it is, now we stop doing these videos. People people been tweeting about it, with tax comes out just under $100. That's what I heard. I'm going to get that Mao controller to go with my Mao console down here. Oh, you would, you would, Greg. Then",

Oh, you would, you would, Greg. Then the biggest thing, the one more thing moment of the Xbox conference, Project Scorpio is real. They're talking about it now. Six teraflops, high-quality pixels you ever seen. Yeah, my my favorite quote of E3, you've never seen a pixel like this before. Never, never seen one like this before. The teraflops, not sure what they're going to do, but I'm happy they're there. But I I honestly, jokes aside, excellent job. This whole this whole trailer, this is hype. This is what E3 is to me. This is this thing where it's like, it makes me feel like it's part of something bigger, even though it's just a bunch of guys talking. These guys are important guys. They are important guys, real important guys. How are they're talking about uh, he's the guy from EA, remember? Good for him. Isn't he the guy who came out and said the thing",

Colin has no idea. You're not the guy who said clowns. I apologize. Here you can see the teraflops, Greg. There's six of them. Oh my God. Yeah, I see the one and the two, the smaller ones there. Um, so that's great. Uh, but this is very, very, very exciting. Sure. I mean, Beyond Generations, the messaging was cool from Phil Spencer out there. Yeah, that they that we moving beyond generations. It's something you definitely saw with them saying, all right, you know, we're doing this whole Xbox PC hybrid model. And like every game they showed was an Xbox Play Anywhere thing where you can take your save on the road and upload it and play it on your PC and play it back on your Xbox, da da da.

That's an awesome improvement. That's awesome, interesting thing. So to see them come out and like have hardware that needs to step up, it's very fascinating. And it's also, you know, the opposite of how Sony got to do it. Sony had everything leak out, right? So everyone ran away with opinions on it. And then Xbox gets to come out and say, this is what we're talking about, this is why we're doing it. We get to inform you of the decision behind Project Scorpio, why it's a good thing, why it's not a bad thing. Everything is still compatible and da da da. Yeah, now it'll be interested to see what happens with what does, do they mention it at all? They said it wouldn't be there, but maybe maybe now they have to do a little something something. Maybe not, maybe they stay away and come back later. I don't know, we'll see later tonight. Follow us",
