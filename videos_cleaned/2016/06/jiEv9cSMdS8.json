We did this episode yesterday and I was thinking about it today and I realized that the way I start the next topic might be jarring for some of you, especially if you're in mixed company or around uh people you don't want to hear really bad language. So I'm just warning you now, especially if you're listening to the audio version, you may want to shut it off if you're with people that you don't really want to hear bad language. All right, we'll see you later. Bye. Colin, yes, what do you got for me? Ah, ****. Why is this word so offensive? Why is this word? No idea. I've never understood this. If you can call everybody a ****, why can't you call everybody ****? See, I don't think you should. I I think it's it is offensive, but why? I don't get it. Is it just is it just because it's reserved for like talking about, oh, that that woman is very mean, so she's a ****? Yeah, that's how it is in our society. Yeah, sure. Well, I know in Britain they use it all the time. They're throwing ****",

It's the the word, the word even in different English-speaking societies, and I think the major English-speaking society is obviously the United States and England. Um, in England it's thrown around like your you can the word **** is basically like punk, like like you're a punt, you're a punk, you're a ****, you're a like like and they're just throwing this word around like it's willy-nilly. Like but United States it has this deep offensive connotation, like this deeply offensive connotation. Like you it's a word you do not use, right? Yeah, and I wonder why that like why that is.

Right, word always been so badly offensive. No, in Middle English the word could be used as a standard term for the female genitalia in a matter of that was quite matter of in a manner that was quite matter of fact.

For example, when Ophelia tells Hamlet that yes, he can lie on her lap, Hamlet puns in his response, \"Do you think I meant country matters?\" That's some **** deep Middle English sh right there. In Twelfth Night, Shakespeare finds a coded way to spell out the word when Malvolio recognizes his ladies sees her use ends her teas.

Linguists note that unlike those other words for the female genitalia whose origins are Latin, euphemistic, or diminutive, **** is plain and Anglo-Saxon. There is also the sound of the word. Many of the most taboo words, in addition to generally being Anglo-Saxon in origin, are monosyllables with short vowels such as ****, piss, ****, ****. These are considered offensive than words with the same meaning like poopy, pee, screw, and Willie. In fact, one of the only other words to share many of those characteristics is ****, which is also considered highly offensive, though its origins are uncertain. So what do you guys think about this? This has always been a weird one to me. It's a word I don't use, but it's a word I don't use because in America I've been programmed to never say it. So when you watch like",

Oh, Governor, you're you're like, okay, you can say cute. So do you guys think that this word should be as loaded? Because I I agree, it's like, why not? It it means the same thing as ****. We call each other **** all the time. There's no offensive. It doesn't though, because with with that in particular, that has a different connotation that over time we've given that. Like you wouldn't call someone a **** and a snatch in the same way. You know what I mean? Snatch, ****, ****.

No, but if I if I were to do that, yeah, I would expect there would probably be a backlash to a certain degree. So I just don't do that.

I just think it's really weird like that word gets people aghast. I actually couldn't think unless it's a like literally a sexually or racially uh a racial term or a sexual term, like a sexist term. I can't think of one word in the English language that makes people as aghast as that word to me. I'm just like, I'm like, I don't get it. I think **** right up there with the N-word.

All these words, they're just words, but these words do cause people to feel a certain way. And I think you just got to think about that ****. And it's like even when it when it goes from those hard words down to the midw like ****, it's like, yeah, you know, we gotten in so many arguments over time and I feel like more and more and more to the point where I'm like, why am I saying that if I don't need to say it even if it is in a term",

I just think it's like it's it's a word that I would never use, but I'm really just wondering like in a philosophical way, like, well, that's think of worse words that we do use.

So that's all I'm trying to say is like, I'm just I'm super interested to see what the audience thinks, especially our female audience about this word because um and also the international audience cause I think some of the international audience will be super surprised.

And it's like, well, because it's like not in good taste necessarily. Doesn't really affect your freedom. You're not like really being restricted in any way.
