I don't want to go through particular like what's your thing today or whatever. I just want to see, I just want to go through what it says about. Do you believe in these? No, I don't at all. It's, you believe in these? No, not at all. It's weird that they've persisted. I don't know anybody who checks them still. This seems like a grandma thing we were talking about, right? This seems like something that you check and be like, no, okay. I think, and here's case in point, maybe we should, one, we'll do another one of these where you mix them up and we'll see if, we'll see who, we'll see if it actually matters.

This is what it says about Pisces strengths: compassionate, artistic, intuitive, gentle, wise, and musical. Your weaknesses: fearful, overly trusting, sad, desire to escape reality, can be a victim or martyr. Pisces likes being alone, sleeping, music, romance, visual media, swimming, spiritual themes. Pisces dislikes: know-it-all, being criticized, the past coming back to haunt, cruelty of any kind. Well, I mean, it's like 50/50. Like just like horseshit, broad shit throwing at the wall, seeing what. Well, Nick loves the past coming back to haunt him. One of his favorite things that shit.

Girl usually falls down, gets knocked out, and then wakes. It doesn't matter anyway. Taurus's dislike: Jesus, sudden changes, complications, insecurity of any kind, synthetic fabrics.

Stable and conservative, Taurus is among the most reliable signs of the zodiac. Stubbornness is a trait that is forcing him to expel things to the end in order to comply with the standards. As an Earth sign, Taurus can be overprotective of their loved ones. They are great in making money, and they will stick to their projects until it is successfully completed. Bulls are known for their stubbornness, but can also be interpreted as a complete commitment to the execution of tasks.

Good managers, he, he keeps the rage in most of the time. That's weaknesses: know-it-all. You're not a know-it-all. Unforgiving. You're not unforgiving. Condescending. You're not condescending.

Capricorn is practical and is considered to be the most serious sign of the zodiac, who possesses an independence that enables significant progress both on the personal level and in business. As an, as an Earth sign, for a Capricorn, there's nothing more important in life than family.

Weaknesses: nervous, inconsistent, indecisive. Gemini likes music, books, magazines, chats with nearly anyone that is 100% short trips around the town. Yes, yes, you always want to be taken out of this house. Gemini dislikes this prison, being alone, being confined, repetition, and routine. Expressive and quick-witted, Gemini represents two different sides of personality. You will never know for, you will never know, you will never be sure, I'm sorry, with whom you will face.

This makes them excellent artists, writers, and journalists. Gemini sign, we know that you can't write, that's for sure. Gemini sign means that sometimes people born under this sign have a feeling that their other half is missing, so they are forever seeking new friends, mentors, and colleagues.
