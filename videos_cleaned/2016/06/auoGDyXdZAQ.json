Rinzler's books of the making of Star Wars and stuff there's a lot of interesting stuff about that but they walked away like George Lucas walked away they could have they could have made more of these movies they made three Indiana Jones movies and they made Young Indy but other than that they were like we're going to we'll have some expanded Universe stuff but we're going to show a little bit of restraint for a while and then they obviously made the new prequels and stuff there's always a capital Endeavor behind doing this kind of thing obviously Star Wars was made for like $10 million or something like that",
