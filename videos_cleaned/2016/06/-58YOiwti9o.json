What's up everybody, welcome to another Kinda Funny Reacts here on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames, E3 Edition. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. Go Jets! Go Jets indeed. Colin, we've almost talked over all this show of Mass Effect: Andromeda. Yeah, but in reality, uh, this was a massive, major disappointment. And to me, them not showing more of the game, not having more to say about it, not even having a release date, that it was out of left field for me, uh, more than anything else that happened. You were prepared for the full-on reveal, release, obvious. I think something's, I don't want to say something's wrong with the game, but I think, I think it's obvious that they have one of two, one of two things going on. They said we'll have more in the fall, so either this can",

They said we'll have more in the fall, so either this can indicate that they're going to have a Mass Effect blowout in the fall, maybe have a Mass Effect event of some sort where they announce the game, they show the game for the first time. They could also be indicating as like 1A that maybe the game is coming out this fall, but I, but I don't think so either. I think what this indicates is that this game is way further out than, than we had anticipated, way further out than EA thought it was going to be when they announced it last year, and it was supposed to be out I think this fall. Um, so, uh, that was really disappointing because Mass Effect: Andromeda is one of my most anticipated games. I love Mass Effect, and, uh, I wanted to see more. So what we, what we saw isn't really even important. We know the Mass Effect in it, it looks great, it's running on Frostbite, which",

We know the Mass Effect in it, it looks great, it's running on Frostbite, which is interesting. I like what they're talking about of like, we've been wondering how the story is going to go. We are Humanity's last hope. We are the, we are the alien in Andromeda. Clearly, I mean, from the way she wakes up at the end of the trailer, I'm assuming the story is, we're launched from the Mass Effect world we know before everything goes to hell. We're launched out and like, all right, you got to go and try to craft in the next thing. We're going to get there and eventually hit the button and try to communicate back and not be able to. Very Battlestar Galactica is in a way, where Battlestar Galactica is about, you know, the remaining humans that are trying to survive and find a place to call home after the Cylon swipe.

We see the return of terrain exploration on planets, uh, in the Andromeda galaxy with Mako type vehicle. Sure. Uh, the new, the new Tempest ship. Yep. We, there are some new ships. I mean, it looks really great. Yeah, but where is it? Like, what, when are we going to see more of it? I mean, that was, that was my major question with this. I love, you know, I know a lot of people don't like Dev Diary and seeing the suit. I like seeing that kind of stuff. It's just like, when that is the replacement for footage and information and you're just leaving us hang about a game that, um, people are really anticipating. I think maybe not as much as Battlefield, but in, in, in, in terms of the hardcore audience, maybe even more. And I just",

I think maybe not as much as Battlefield, but in, in, in, in terms of the hardcore audience, maybe even more. And I just feel like this represents, this game represents the dichotomy of EA's presentation more than anything else, which is like, games that are imminent that we know about, like Titanfall and Battlefield 1, they and FIFA and Madden and all the annualized games that you know are going to be there and you know it's like whatever. And then, but the anticipated games like Star Wars and Mass Effect, they have nothing to say about them. The future is bright for EA with all these studios working on these games. Obviously, BioWare doing a fantastic job, I'm sure, on the new Mass Effect, but you have to have something to say. It makes you wonder if EA should even had a conference at all. And the big thing we talked about during the, the post show Kinda Funny Gamescast available on YouTube is the fact, I was like, I think",

And then like, you should have been totally Renegade of like, we're doing EA Play, you can come play Titanfall, it's open to the public, and that's it. No press conference, we're not ready for any of it. You know, Madden's going to be great, you know, Battlefield is going to be great, you know, Titanfall's going to be great. But yeah, and yeah, and we know Mass Effect's going to be great, right? And that was, that was the, it's just, and, and take your time. I have no problem with the studio taking all the time they need, a great studio like BioWare, um, taking all the time that they need to craft this, this quest and this, this vision that they have for this new game. I have no problem with that at all.",

I have no problem with that at all. What I have a problem with is, is developers or publishers, really, it's not even the developers, it's the publishers announcing these games way too early, putting a gun against the developers' heads to reach these time frames that are un, that are clearly unrealistic, and they have nothing to show for it. This happens over and over again, again. And we saw that also as we're not going to get into too much, we might as well since we're talking about sci-fi and space. And I know that by the way, you don't like sci-fi settings, so you're not going to play Mass Effect, obviously. But, but the, but the Star Wars, Mass Effect changed the world, 'cause Mass Effect 1 bad game, Mass Effect amazing. Mass Effect 1 wasn't a bad game. Mass Effect 1 was a bad game if you don't like video games. No, that's not a, I like games. I can't",

No, that's not a, I like games. I can't right. Uh, LEGO Dimensions. But to me, uh, we see this, this is indicative of not only what's happening with BioWare, the two BioWare studios with EA, but also with the way they're treating Star Wars, where it's just like little breadcrumbs, like just off, you should not had a presence. Make your game, tell me about. And this is the painful thing about it is that Electronic Arts, I think, much like Ubisoft, make high caliber games typically in the AAA space. Yeah, and I really do believe that. But this, this is, there's a dissonance between their presentation and the actual quality of, I'm sure, of these games. And I, I, I agree with you, as we were saying, and as we were talking about, they probably should have had a no-show. And I feel like they, the press conference was scattered and all those kinds of things. And Mass",

And I feel like they, the press conference was scattered and all those kinds of things. And Mass Effect fell victim of yet another early announced, premature announce. Learn from Bethesda. I'll keep saying it over and over again, learn from it. Everyone needs to learn from them. Final point, I think with, I'm talking about, you know, more to come in the fall. What I immediately jump to is Game Awards, PSX, something like that, 'cause I don't know what you're putting it out. I mean, Comic-Con, like, well, yeah, but I feel like that's still like, that's end of summer, beginning of fall, which counts. But like, is, do you really want to send any EA BioWare game to par? I think they're going to have an event. Yeah, and I think that that's fine and that's appropriate. But don't expect that everyone's going to be, I mean, they, they're not stupid people.
