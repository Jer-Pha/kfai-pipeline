What's up, guys? I'm Tim Gettys. This is Greg Miller. We're taking a look at the two Titanfall 2 trailers that came out. We got the single player and the multiplayer. We start withing why Colin more already always introduces Portillo. You're too good for it today. T's there. He has a Superman egg thing. It's I think it might be a Susum that I read so much about. A T. That is that what a Susum is? No, it is not what a Susum is, but they're kind of Titanfall. You started with the weak ass single player trailer. I am into it. What are you into here? Let me idea. Let me dial back. Let me dial for. Go for it. I don't think the trailer is impressive. I don't think the story looks that impressive. I like Titanfall. I'm excited for multiplayer. I of course regen twice in Titanfall on Xbox One, putting that out there. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, Colin.",

Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, Colin. Thank you, Nick. Yeah, I'm not impressed with you, Greg, but I'm also not very impressed with this trailer. I agree with you. I think it's a pretty weak trailer. Um, I think it lacks a lot of like wow moments that the multiplayer trailer does have, but I I do like the the kind of Buddy system we got going on with the boy and his Mech. Sure, it's just the Mech doesn't have enough personality already. Really? I I kind of like it. Uh, there's no other options. I don't know. I can't confirm this, but it sounds like it's Optimus Prime's voice. It does sound like that. I agree, which is very exciting. There's nothing I want more than Optimus Prime to be my buddy. Sure, but is it just is a does he have a personality? Is he sentient? Is that we building towards him? Sure, he totally is, but even just looking at this, it's like",

Didn't play at the EA press conference. This video plays with no you have no idea it's Titanfall. Yeah, I think it looks like a mid-range. It's a whatever. It's a it's a mid-tier first-person shooter. You don't know it's first person necessarily. Who cares? This giant Mechs. This looks **** awesome. This reminds me of the Mech scene in Metal Gear Solid 4. You've insulted me and the memory of Hideo Kojima. No, no, no, no. This looks awesome, man. Look at him still alive. Look at him. He's walking through and he's all like, \"I'm so I'm so damaged. I'm so hurt. Help me, buddies.\" And it's it's a tale of friends, man. It's fine, but like you got no heart, Miller. You got no heart.

I have heart. I just it's just like I feel like here's the thing. I am not Mr. First-Person Shooter. I played a lot of Titanfall. I like a lot of Titanfall. I'm going to play a lot of Titanfall 2. A lot of trophies because on PlayStation 4, I think the Battlefield 1 trailer that looked superb and amazing and crazy, that looks like a ride I want to be on in a in a single player story. Yeah, oh man. See, I guess it's just I'm I'm more of an anime guy. I like the Mechs. I like the swords. I like the stuff like the Battlefield. It does look great. Doesn't speak to me at all. This definitely speaks to me. Titanfall, glad so excited for Titanfall. And then I was like, \"Oh man, not excited for Titanfall,\" because I just don't really like multiplayer shooters like that, except for Overwatch. I really, really, really like Overwatch. See, there the exceptions. Did you ever try the",

Wasn't no, I agree with you though. Like this trailer, this is a superb trailer. And like I'm just but I'm just talking about the way everything looks. Even it looks better than it did in single player. I don't I don't see that. Okay, you're allowed for straws. No, I'm not. The everything that's happening is way more interesting than hold on. It's the Mech with one arm going down the microwave. Look at how how did he get the one arm, Greg? I'm sure got blown off. Nobody cares that. Look at how great that looked. Look at how great this looks. No, see that that's the thing is like the the single player Titanfall it looks like it misses the the wow moments that that we're seeing all",

I don't want them to spoil all the stuff in the the gameplay trailer story trailer. Cool, great. Tell me the single player story. I'm just saying that you people out there who and didn't play the original Titanfall, and here we are now single player story. This I love this. The like the the bomb that like pulls every pull them. It was great. I love the grappling hook. I love like everything you're seeing like and then even just basic stuff. There you go, thatched rope. **** hell yeah. Then you shoot this guy. Sorry, how did he stop though? That don't know. I there's you you know in Titanfall you had a little bit of that double jump, that little hover pack kind of stuff.

Of course, of course, the single player so far behind the multiplayer that they threw at the wall and then just cut away because like single player guys are over there like, \"We can't even animate it. We don't know how to make them wall run.\" The multiplayer guys are outclassing us in every sense. I hate you so much. Just saying, look at wolf girl up here pulling action at the Mook God. That guy. Did you see how I get obliterated? Hold on, let's I want to rewind back to that once I find my mouse. You won't find it in time here. And then there it just let it play out at this point. That is awesome. Got Scorpion. Come on. That is awesome. All right, boom. That guy. I don't know how you can trailer and be like, \"You're more excited for single player,\" just because this.

Yeah, I know, but like there just seems like again, this is just me, seems like there's way too many systems and stuff that a single player campaign teaches you over time, gives you the big moments. I don't know. I just I don't want to invest into that type of stuff. I'm really happy a lot of other people do, and guess what? **** ton of people are going to because now it's on PlayStation 4. Just confirm Titanfall 1 not coming. Oh, really? To PlayStation 4. No surprise. I guess you don't really need it. What are you just frantically double? I'm trying to get this thing to come back.
