Tim, I think I'd like to do the talking over the press conference bits. Don't I? Says no. Just be like that long time. And, uh, you know, if something crazy happens like Crash Bandicoot, you know, you get that reactions being announced, then you get me freaking. If it was really funny E3, it was really good. It was, oh my god, it was an excellent E3. Yeah, I came, I was thinking about last night, I couldn't sleep. I was just like, man, last week, E3, yeah, it happened. It happened, it happened, and it were amazing. We're driving, we were driving out to the airport, we drove past the Convention Center. I said that deep sigh like, it's over.

I thought it was just like it revitalized E3 for me. I mean, I'm always in love with E3. Yeah, this year I was just like, yeah, yeah. I got to stay with the talking over the talk over the press conference. It was the only thing I didn't like doing because I felt like I was being watched watching something else. Like I was opposed another group. I didn't like it because I like to like take my notes. Yeah, people like, look, like I have this seat when I'm watching something or else I'm sitting or paying attention to something. I did the same static look on my face. I'm not sad or happy.

Yeah, we can't wait for more. We can't wait to play those three games in the camera more E3. Do I am still just as a tangential kind of thing with the Crash remasters, they said from the ground up. I don't believe for a second that those games are being remade. I think a lot of people think that like they're like they're gonna be given the Ratchet & Clank treatment. No, it's not. It's not. There's been, there's been a lot of rumblings, a lot of interviews going off here and there like random little sources.

We'll probably get the widescreen. I'm hoping for an orchestrated soundtrack. How are they gonna do? I wonder how that you're gonna do widescreen. This is what I'm interested. It's like how they can, I don't know, they're gonna be able to do it. Yeah, it'll be interesting. So reason to all you do is run straight to the camera the whole goddamn game. That's not your right. Sometimes the camera's behind you, you run down a very small corridor. You guys, you know, you've made me, you convinced me that these aren't good games. No, but you guys are wrong.

No, it's very easy to please. Make an ass of themselves and so many more. And nobody, when they come out and they play them again, then you see the other side. Now, these are fine. If all the the classic platformers of the Super Nintendo/Genesis era can stand up like the Disney games and all the other four teams that are shit awesome, this shit stands up to like, are they, is it Mario? No, it's no Mario. Of course, no, Mario. Yeah, no, but it's shit, long. You have to be careful. Don't like what you ask for what these games to with like, I was not always, but when Mega Man 9 was released, so I thought, 'Why isn't this in widescreen?'

So there's gotta be reason like, and the game's rendered in this specific way. I don't know that they're gonna be able to get those games in a widescreen unless they zoom in or something, which they're not gonna be able to do either. So I part come see, I think you're gonna get, I think you're gonna get, but they're made within the frame of the, I don't know. I'm, this is the excitement about Crash Bandicoot. I'd never, I'd never understand Crash Bandicoot. So I'm not gonna pretend like Crash in 1998-99, I get a higher Q-score than Mario, which was a significant thing back in the day. I'm still is gonna be way more significant back then. He had a, everyone knew who Crash Bandicoot was. So I was definitely the minority on that.

That means this is exactly what I wanted. I've spoken about this many times now, but like, I didn't, I don't want a Crash 4 yet. I want these to come out. I want remaster to the three good games. You want to revitalize, you want to have people understand what makes Crash special special and then go forward and give us a new one then because or else we're just gonna get a new Crash and it's gonna suck. We all know that that would just suck. Yeah, so there was a great like documentary video essay that just came out. Look it up on YouTube. It's Crash Bandicoot: Decline of an Icon.

It's like a 15 minute thing that kind of dissects what happened to Crash and why went from good games to horrible games. Yeah, and I really, really fascinating stuff. And I didn't realize how well the original Crash game sold. All three games, top 10 best-selling PlayStation 1 games. All three of them sold more than Final Fantasy VII. Mmm-hmm. Over 10 million copies sold in the, the, yeah, Crash was huge. They turn those games really quickly too. And the other thing is they did back now.

He's not like, I'm shit rad and cool again. He's like, I don't. Posey does the DX cracks things were in jorts. He's more just kind of like not knowing what's going on and like weird and kooky and wacky and animated with all of his stuff. It's not like he's like this shit too cool for school. That was Sonic in the Adventure days. Yes, sure, for sure. Just reiterate that. Anyway, anyways, moving on to other great, you know, successors to games we all loved, Mega Man, right? Let's talk about Mighty No. 9. What do you think about it? I think that it's not good. And I think that, I think that was, I think it was pretty obvious it wasn't gonna be good for a while actually.

I think that the first time I played it, which was years ago now, I knew that it wasn't gonna be like this fantastic game. I remember the first time you play that, you came back and said, 'It doesn't, it isn't Mega Man. It's different. It's this, it's more action-based.' Yeah, it's not Mega Man. And then that's, and that I think is a disappointing kind of thing. You know, a friend of ours from Deep Silver, who's, you know, they obviously published the game, tweeted out today that he was disappointed what some people's reviews, which I understand. I mean, but saying that like people are expecting are docking the game for not being Mega Man, whatever.

And there's some, there's some features of the game that are Mega Man-esque, such as the non-linearity in them and you get the bosses' weapons and so like that. But the game is just a soulless husk. It doesn't feel like anything. It doesn't look like anything. It just, it looks cheap. It looks amateurish. It has that voice acting is shit awful. The the storytelling is silly. They they had a chance to rectify what the technical imitations of the NES Mega Man games wouldn't allow them to do, which is to tell a cool story and have cool bosses and which work. And and and it's so weird that like these 8-bit Mega Man games just shit on this game, just shit on it. And from a graphical aesthetic, like Mega Man games have an identity, especially with",

They have enemy diversity. They have geographic diversity. It's this 2.5D graphics garbage that makes that really hurts Mighty No. 9, I think. And also, I think that it's just, it's easy for the most part. There's one part of the game that we can talk about that's ridiculous, but it's easy. It's it's score-based. It's all these kinds of things. So I just, I don't, the more I play it, as I tweeted out yesterday, the more I play it, the more I don't like it.

I mean, it feels, it feels bad because, feels bad, man, because, well, that's what I was saying on Twitter and I had reflected a few people where I'm like, this is it. Like, I've kind of come to accept this is the game. This is the game that they worked on for years that I feel that I feel like could have been made as a shit school project by some programmers and some animators at USC.

I just think it's so mediocre and so unremarkable that it's amazing that it came out of Inti Creates, which is a studio that makes shit fantastic games. And that it came out in Inafune's mind, which is a man that designed, helped design Mega Man, designed all these robots and this gameplay and helped produce some of the great Capcom franchises of the more recent years like Onimusha and Dead Rising. Like, he's no slouch. And I don't understand how this game came out the way it did and the way it will and the way it looks.

And it's just, it's just so, like I said, it's just unremarkable. It's just so bland and boring. I just don't care about it. I don't even care about now that you've moved to acceptance. What does it mean for Inafune as a creator? What does it mean for ReCore? What does this mean for that other game, the Red Storm or whatever? Is Red Ash, right? Ash. Um, so I don't know anything about that. Like Red Ash, Shriver, I saw a ReCore E3 and I think it looks fine. I think it looks again like generic.

I mean, like, are you getting the same vibes of this is Charlie charging $40 for what I'm pretty sure was not their intention the entire time? I think that maybe it was, but I doubt it. ReCore looks fun, but it looks just generic. So you look at like Inafune, these other games like Soul Sacrifice. I think it was fine. It was good. It's just like, where is the magic? That's the kind of the question I have. And a lot of people are asking, you know, you've asked and it's brought up like, is Inafune's reputation suffer for this? Yes. Like, you can't take away what he's done. And and the great, and he's a great man. Like, E3 remarked when I was at E3 that it's so weird. He knows who I am. He comes up to me and shakes my hand.

I don't think Deep Silver did the game I need any any favors obvious with its shit awful trailer and its lack of messaging about what was going on with the game during its delays.

It looks empty and static. These 3D graphics, these 2.5D graphics suck. Yeah, and there are games that look beautiful in that aesthetic. I know that that aesthetic is cheaper to make and that's why they do it. That's why they don't do 2D flat 2D with sprites and hand-drawn things.

Even Sonic's talking shit, which I thought was, I thought Sonic's tweet was both the sign that jacked it. It was both funny and in super bad taste. Yeah, especially because Sonic the Hedgehog categorically sucks. So like, I don't know that that's what his social account is like.

And I remember everybody lost their shit. And again, granted, when you're in the back panel, people get excited and stuff. But even the people were that IGN, like that was one things like, we need to do a conversation right now. Get this up. This is news.

We're now you can't get anyone to cover your Kickstarter with a ten-foot pole. Exactly. So if you can take a step back, if you weren't a Mega Man fan, do you think that this game holds up at all? No, because I think, I just think it's again, it's unremarkable. Like, why would you play it? In other words, if it has no, if you have no, if you have no connection to Mega Man or Inafune or old Capcom games of what sure were some of the best games that were made at the time, then why would you play this at all? Because it doesn't, it's just, it's just not fun. It's like not the idea is that the gameplay is fun enough and fluid enough to play. But I ask the question, why? Like, I'm even asking my question, like, why? Like, these characters suck. Beck sucks. You know, like Call sucks. The doctors suck. Like, like, there's there's just there's just no",
