Right now we're taking a look at We Happy Few, a game that got a surprising amount of time at the Microsoft press conference all things considered, but I think it looks really interesting and was one of my favorite moments of the entire press conference. Yeah, I agree. Uh, the game uh looks awesome. This was a Kickstarted game um that seems like ID@Xbox might be infusing a little bit of money to to get it first. Um, it's got significant BioShock vibes, significant Ken Levine influences I think can be seen here. Um, it's a really interesting idea as people see um moving forward. It seems like you're in a heavily medicated society. Um, you're kind of like trying to break free the entire story uh at least from the outside reminds me a little bit of like a I got like a Rod Serling Twilight Zone kind of vibe from this, which you get from BioShock as well. So it seems, I mean, look at it. I",

So it seems, I mean, look at it. I mean, even aesthetically, even the way the camera moves, it's BioShock and it's kind of I'm a hu I mean, how many times I have to say I'm a huge BioShock? It's one of my favorite games of all time, BioShock. So um anything that takes a page out of that book and will do it successfully, and it seems like they're going to do it successfully. The thing is I I keep I keep saying this looks like a really like smaller scale BioShock, which is interesting to me because like I like that. I like the smaller experiences and I think that like watching this the this gameplay makes me feel emotion and that's good. You know, that's obviously the goal with these type of games and I think that the end of this this trailer with the pi\u00f1ata, like as you can see over here here, it's creepy as all ****. Yeah, it is super",

Yeah, it is super creepy and again, it's really unnerving. Yeah, it reminds me of the um the golf club scene a little bit in in the original BioShock to a degree, not really just in kind of that it's like a little jarring. Um, but uh yeah, I think that uh this is a game that wasn't really on my radar actually at all. I knew that it existed. I'd seen things on it. Greg had actually played it I think at PAX um and was raving about it. These guys had successfully funded their game. Um, when I see a game like this, um Compulsion Games doing their thing kind of independently, it makes me wonder if they were interested in staying outside of the publisher ecosystem for the most part in kind of retaining their own identity and their own independence because this is a game to me that I would have been surprised that other team",

In other words, like this seems like a game that a first party would have tried to pick up. Um, and they have in their own kind of way, but I had said on our uh on our stream that it looks like it's an Xbox One console exclusive, but that's apparently not the case. It's coming first Xbox One, but when I was researching, they have not yet announced it for PS4. It is coming to PC and Linux I think as well, but I hope it comes PS4. Yeah, me too. But if it doesn't, I mean, this is one of those games where you kind of plug in the Xbox One and play it. We have, you know, 10 PS4s in the house and one Xbox One. Um, and we're very open and honest about that, but the games come along and you have to play them and you know, um I think this is really one of those cool looking",

This is way cooler looking to me than those. So um this is definitely on my high on my list in the indie realm on Xbox One. Yeah, definitely. As as the the trailer was going on or the the gameplay video, whatever, um it started off and I was like, all right, cool, it's a BioShock like ripoff. And then as it went on, I'm like, oh, this is actually really cool. This is something really unique and I like the the the world seems really, really cool and the kind of mind-based things. I was like, huh, I don't really like this. But then by the end of it, like the the drugs being happy and like the joy, I think they were calling it, it's awesome. Very cool. I",

I mean, I don't think it's it is a BioShock ripoff, but I like I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing. Yeah, I don't think it's a bad thing either. I mean, we can't know that without having played it, but I mean, just looking at the way they're telling the story, looking at the way you're moving through the environment, I mean, it is BioShock and there's nothing wrong with taking influence from great games like that. Better to take influence from a game like BioShock than another game that it sucks. So you know, more power to him. I'm super excited to see what Compulsion comes up with.
