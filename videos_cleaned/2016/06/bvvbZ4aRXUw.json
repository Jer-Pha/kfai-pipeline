We're excited to be able to show you a preview of Ghost Recon Wildlands brought to you by Ubisoft and Amazon. What's up guys? I'm Tim Gettys, this is Greg Miller. Here we are at the Ubisoft Booth E3 2016. We just played Ghost Recon Wildlands. We did. What do you think? Here's what I want to say: this video is clearly sponsored by Ubisoft, so take it all with a grain of salt. But I loved it. And I and and before the before this video was sponsored, when we weren't sponsored by Ubisoft, I said how much I like the trailer at the demo at E3 uh in the press conference. Playing it totally paid off. Oh man, you and I getting to play it and getting in there and getting to communicate and do the whole thing of like we were role playing with it like they were in the that's the thing the press conference, you know, they had that thing where everyone's role playing. I got eyes on a sniper, wait for my signal, got it, now Tango down.",

I got eyes on a sniper, wait for my signal, got it, now Tango down, let's move. It was like a little a little far, yeah, where it's like no one actually plays games. Like what was cool was here we were, we had a setup that the four of us were next to each other, headsets on, and we had a team leader and the guy was kind of doing that. So it kind of made us we all did Ghost One. I was Ghost Two, he was Ghost Three and was kind of going through it. It's like Ghost Three went rogue, was killing all the alpacas. I'm like they didn't like me killing the alpacas, they didn't like me killing the regular citizens, but NPCs deserve to die. We all know this, very true. But uh I really liked it where it was very um objection based and the objections would kind of change over time where it's like as you go through the mission, the mission would change and like calling out different things you",

You can use the drone to kind of go and pick out all the different targets and it's not just all right, here's the targets, go kill them. Some of the waves of it are, but then it's like all right, go interrogate this guy, go hack this thing. And it was cool where different team members could be doing different tasks at the same time. Yeah, I like I mean I liked about it and it'll be interesting because they made a big deal obviously during our let's play and then of course during the demo of talking about the fact that you could play it single player if you wanted to. But like when I grabbed the guy to interrogate him, you know, team leader was like all right, circle up around him, support him. And they did that and and it was giving me cover while I interrogated which helped. I can't imagine if I do it",

I can't imagine if I do it alone, I'm going to have to go through right and you know, take care of everyone I guess to get to that one point. Yeah, definitely definitely is a team game. I can't wait to do a let's play with all of us. Yeah, that's what I best thing is like doing the objections is fun, but just imagining Nick running around doing dumb **** if I'm shooting. It definitely seems like a really fun game to play with your play. It's what I was talking about before, right? It seems like everything I loved about The Division until I didn't love The Division anymore where if it's just like we zoomed out of the map, 100 story missions, all these different territories to take down bosses to find. If it's just that and it doesn't get to the end game of grind grind grind grind grind, get better gear, I'm totally in longer than I was",

Cause I get totally that's a game I can see me trying to and forcing you to play with me at night. Kevin will be all over it where we can sit down and actually all right, let's go out and clear this place tonight. And it won't always be Ghost One, Ghost Two, it will be bullshitting and like oh ****, snipe that guy, I'm getting killed. I mean it's cool, it reminds me of the Metal Gear Solid vibe, like trying to like go into the encampments and kind of scoping it out but with the team. That's cool. It's like working with your friends to kind of decide the best way to infiltrate and get in. What I also really liked was there's a lot of vehicles. You can kind of get in them, but it's not there's not one way to play it. So there was a helicopter. There's a point where our team leader was like all",

There's a point where our team leader was like all right, everybody get to the chopper. It's pretty far, we got to go Ghost Three, Sweet Forus, Sweet Forus found to for Taurus doing his thing just went by. He was already halfway there. But then we took the chopper, we're going, we had to go down, pick this **** up. Then we flying up and then the guy like all right, we're going to parachute out. And I'm like damn right we are. So we did that ****. He's like go to the smoke. We're like what? There's like a smoke plume y going up, go to that. And then Greg, the only one like a gazelle just flying down through there. Gazelles fly? I don't know. Think they gliding straight down. Have to fly right right right down into the into the smoke. Just landed. Where's all that's just **** crash. Eric, do gazelles fly? They do if you believe hard enough. I believe hard enough. I",

I believe hard enough. I definitely do. Uh yeah, I had a great time. Uh like I said, reminded me of the part of The Division, the the way we use the helicopter, the way we did the missions. What it reminded me a lot of and I'm not a big multiplayer guy, you know, it reminded me of when I was into GTA 4 multiplayer when it was like okay, let's get a helicopter and go do this mission and come back down and do. I like the idea that we can all go do our things and then come back together when we need to. Yeah, def. I will say that the the helicopter stop not flying it uh being in the passenger was a little disoriented. Oh yeah, I was getting a little car sick with like like the helicopter would really kind of like get out there was like a real helicopter would I guess. Yeah, but like I don't I don't need all I hear in terms of criticism.",

Yeah, but like I don't I don't need all I hear in terms of criticism. There was that they had the AI dumbed down a bit so it's hard to then critique the AI cause it's a demo. But it was that thing of like I sniped the guy in front of another guy and the other guy's like what's going on? And then he finally oh, but I shoot him by then. Whatever. I saw bodies disapp when I I but the world is so so big. So it was like the popping was so far out in the distance that it's just like all right, cool. Uh yeah, definitely it was a lot of fun. I'm very excited for it. I I can't wait to play together. I think that's exactly exactly for us ladies and gentlemen. Are you excited for Ghost Recon Wildlands? Let us know in the comments below.
