What's up, guys? I'm Tim Gettys. This is Greg Miller. Now, before we even get into this, let's start off with a little little you right here. Bam! Only on PlayStation. That's right, Spider-Man PS4 exclusive. How your ass, PC players? Finally, we got something on you. You have your exclusives like Solitaire of Spider-Man. Not sure how exclusive that is, but uh, oh man, this trailer, this trailer is different. This conference is insane. There's so many good, there's the big part, Insomniac Games doing. But yeah, look at how good this looks right here. Look at how the New York they're working in right now. So awesome to have, uh, this is what I was talking about early on, the PS I Love You, the fact that Marvel is taking their properties and giving it to developers, right? And saying, all right, you're we not a developer we own, we didn't partner with one",

And saying, all right, you're we not a developer we own, we didn't partner with one publisher like Activision that this shot. Are you f***ing kidding me right here of him hopping through that cafe and hopping out the window? See, my thing there's though, like gameplay, how is that? How is that gameplay? Or is that just like one of those like kind of guided thing? Cause this, this is what dreams were made of back in the Spider-Man 2 days. Oh yeah, there you go. Uh, but this looks great. I can't wait to fly through this city. Oh yeah, but going through that, it's like, I don't know, that seems a little too, that might be just a cutscene thing of jumping through and then here's more gameplay of throwing this guy around or whatever. But I mean, just having a Spider-Man game that is being treated like you assume if it's Insomniac, if it's exclusive, is being treated like a Rocksteady Batman game. But listen,",

But listen, the score, like I think this alone kind of sets the standard for this is epic. This is a real Spider-Man thing. This isn't just like a license. They're not cashing in. They're not cashing in at all. Not tied into the movie apparently. Not the same suit as what I'm basing that on. I don't know for sure. Uh, not tied in in the movie. Looks like it's standalone property. It's Marvel in their new games initiative of going to developers that are good at something at all and saying, all right, cool, make a game like this. And I like how they don't even have a name for really, just Spider-Man PS4 is all it's called. Spider-Man PS4. And also, I look at it, it seems like it's grabbing a lot of inspirations from a lot of stuff. Like so, this right here is the longer kind of Amazing Spider-Man movie, the the most recent Sony",

But then when you go a little bit further, this is not exactly, but it's more reminiscent of the Sam Raimi Spider-Man font. Sure, going on. Even, I mean, the the big white thing on him, I was asking you with it. You're, I'm of course, DC Fanboy. You're more than Marvel guy. I like, I love Spider-Man as everybody does know. I do review Spider-Man games historically. But and like a lot of people, I was like, is this anything we should call out to? And you were like, no, it looks like it's an original suit. Kids in the chat were saying it's original. Somebody hit me up saying as big as the suit is, it looks like it might be Ben Reilly. I'm like, I I know Ben Reilly. I'm not prepared to make that leap. Maybe it's an inspired suit. Yeah, no, I think that, uh, this suit is new and I also think that it is very",

Yeah, no, I think that, uh, this suit is new and I also think that it is very, very intentional. I think that they were trying to mimic the Civil War suit, but they needed to make it clear this is not a movie. And I think white kind of does that where it's just like they took the hit of like, all right, it looks kind of stupid, but whatever. This at least makes it clear everybody that this is a different Spider-Man, different universe. It's not the comics. It's not the like, it's not Ultimate Spider-Man, right? This is very clearly not Miles Morales. Yeah, this is very clearly. He mentions being from Queens and everything else, right? He's nailing all the Peter Parker beats. You exactly. But I mean, even the the suit, like it's not even the Peter Parker from the Ultimate Universe. It's not even the like the Peter Parker from the the normal comic going on right now, like Amazing Spider-Man.",

I also like that we don't really see any like Spider-Man villains in this the trailer. Yeah, and it still looks awesome. Yeah, you know, there's, I mean, I think it's pretty clear from the way the trailer plays out, it's a very early tease. And the fact that they don't have a name, they don't have like a logo, they want to show you, it's just like, hey, we are doing the Spider-Man game. This is where it is. I assume next year at E3, we get a real blowout demo. Here's what it is. Yeah, color me excited. I will.
