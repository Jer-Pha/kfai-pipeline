What's up guys? I'm Tim Gettys. This is the pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. Go Jets! Today we're talking about Horizon Zero Dawn. This is the the pre-E3 trailer, I guess. So yeah, I'm sure we'll see more of it. The kind of like story trailer, I'm assuming. Yeah, at the press conference we'll get a different trailer, maybe more of a gameplay focused thing. Yeah, so uh it's by Guerrilla Games, mhm, uh games best known, Sony-owned studio in Amsterdam, best known for uh the Killzone series. Uh this is something very different for them. It's an open-world third-person action role-playing game and uh it's takes place in a far-flung future, it seems, where we've gone back to a primitive state but there are machines and evidence, uh there's these machines roaming around that are like dinosaur-like mechs basically that you'll see in the trailer.",

So this trailer is actually really cool because we had actually seen the game a year ago at E3. I saw behind closed doors and it was also shown at the press conference. Um and to me this really uh illuminates some of the story and some of the plot and some of what you're doing in the game. So I think it looks really really cool. I was super happy to see this drop. Um although I don't know why they they didn't hold it till E3, which only makes me hopeful we'll find out tomorrow, um that they have more to show. Yeah, I'm sure they do. I'm definitely we'll see some some nice gameplay going on there. Um this, I'm so sold on this game. Like last year seeing the first trailers,",

Like last year seeing the first trailers, it was just like immediately everyone was wowed by it. But this trailer in particular really kind of got me excited because I I'm not too into the whole open-world RPG type stuff and I think this airs a bit more on the action side. You see you're climbing a lot, like you get a nice Uncharted vibe for this that excites me. I think that uh they know what they got going on and I think that that this is going to appeal to the gamers like me out there that kind of want something that's a bit more fast-paced and not so much of a, oh there's loot everywhere and shit's going on. I'm sure that'll be in this, but I think it'll be a bit more um like you know, watered down but in a good way. Yeah, last year we saw a little bit about like the they basically tried to emphasize a few things obviously like the",

Yeah, last year we saw a little bit about like the they basically tried to emphasize a few things obviously like the kind of asymmetric combat in the game and the different ways that you can handle enemies. So they showed uh her fighting this like massive Brontosaurus type enemy, you would say, maybe not maybe not quite that big, um by tripping it or by just attacking it directly with her arrows and stuff like that. These guys do drop loot and materials that you're then going to craft into things. We don't exactly know how that system works per se yet, uh in any deep way. Uh we kind of only got a cursory look at it. Um so it's definitely got I I would say role play, it seem, I mean who the knows, but it really does seem to have role-playing elements um akin to a Far Cry game or something. But how how deep does it get? I don't know. The main character, Aloy, um seems to have a at least a somewhat diverse arsenal. I like that",

The main character, Aloy, um seems to have a at least a somewhat diverse arsenal. I like that she's like riding a mount. These enemy designs are amazing, Colin, like it's just such a such a cool, like the game kind of has a, what was the game last gen, uh Enslaved, Enslaved: Odyssey To the West. Yes, exactly. It kind of has that vibe to it. But the the enemies and the the, I guess not enemies, the with the mount and all that stuff too, like all of the the creatures have such a a cool unique look to them that uh really sets it apart. It's a really unique, it seems like, I mean who knows what I was going to talk about, it seems like a unique story, unique take. That's awesome. Yeah, and he's a guy, I mean he enemies and this is what I like, this is very Killzone-esque. Um a lot of these enemies remind me of of at least with their orange eyes and stuff, some of them with has Helghast machines, other of them look",

Um a lot of these enemies remind me of of at least with their orange eyes and stuff, some of them with has Helghast machines, other of them look totally exotic and like things you've never seen before. I mean this game's been in development for a long time. Greg and I got wind to this game a long time time ago, like I would say like five years ago. Um and uh we didn't know what it was yet, but the word was that they were working on an open-world role-playing game and they are. They hired writers and a team to be able to do that concurrent to making Shadow Fall, which was a PS4 launch game. And I'm sure that they're probably making another Killzone game as well. But um I'm excited about this because it's a different look. It's definitely look. I like I like that uh you're you're right, the creatures do look kind of Killzone-esque, but combined in this this world, it's a nice clash that I think really has a nice visual aesthetic to the whole thing and all the",

Like there's the, it looks like there's a world, there's a really developed world here and that's exciting. Like you can see this having franchise potential. Um and I love that, you know, like with especially with Uncharted kind of, you know, dying down, I think that it's nice to have another PlayStation exclusive to look forward to, to that point, absolutely. And that's what I told Greg on PS I Love You, I think last week, which is that my instinct, my my hunch on Horizon is that this could be not a new franchise, but like the next big thing. Um you said the next Uncharted and that's exactly what I said too. I think that if they play their cards right, Horizon could be a massive franchise for PlayStation because people like open worlds, they like nonlinearity, they like um action role-play games and so",

I think that if they play their cards right, Horizon could be a massive franchise for PlayStation because people like open worlds, they like nonlinearity, they like um action role-play games. And so uh to have one exclusive to the console, I think it's going to be very strong for them. Is it going to be a Gran Turismo seller of 10 million? I don't think so. But but I think it'll do well. And I so if the game pans out, you know, hopefully we'll learn more about it. Unfortunately, it's been delayed. February 8th, 2017 was originally supposed to go out in the fall this year. But Guerrilla should take all the time they need. They've already taken a bunch of time on the game anyway. A few more months can't hurt. Yeah, and to give it even more compliment is like this right here is very Metroid-esque, specifically Metroid Prime-esque. And I'm excited to see if there is that type of, it's not only an action RPG, but also kind of has that unlock system of like trying to go around kind of like the the Arkham games.",

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I think I we that's the thing I'm excited about and why I think we're going to see way more of Horizon in the E3 is that there's just a lot more to explain and I think they're doing it very slowly. Um so I think we're going to see more of the systems and more the way the game works and perhaps the backtracking and stuff. But it looks awesome. The box art's dope as well. Very very very exciting, ladies and gentlemen. For way more on E3 2016, subscribe right here on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames. We will see you soon.",
