What's up everybody? Welcome to Kinda Funny Games E3 2016 pre-E3 show coverage, but by the time you watch this, it'll probably be dead in the heat of E3. I'm Nick Scarpino, it's your boy Tim Gettys. Tim, there have been a lot of exciting things already happened, but what are we looking forward to now? What are we looking at now? Right now, we at Kingdom Hearts HD Remix 2.8. Now in case you're not Hearts HD Remix 2.8. Okay, good. I'm glad, 'cause 2.7 rubbish. Well, it's this game is actually titled, um, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue. So just in case you were little a little bit confused, I wanted to make sure that you were good. So what this is, Nick, obviously this is this is a a PlayStation 4 game, okay? Right. Kingdom Hearts HD Remix 1.5 came out on PS3, which included Kingdom Hearts 1 and um, Chain of Memories. Obviously, yeah, it's",

And uh, that was the GBA game that they eventually then put onto the PlayStation, right? Um, then there was another one, I think was called Re:coded. Then we had Kingdom Hearts HD Remix 2.5, which was Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep and uh, 358/2 Days, okay? Or something. That was a DS game. Don't don't really remember what happened there. All right, so now since we're on our way from Kingdom Hearts 3 and everybody's so excited for Kingdom Hearts 3, they're like, you know what, let's make them wait a little bit longer. We can add a 2.8 in there. So we're getting 2.8. So what 2.8 is, yeah, what is 2.8? Uh, to educate you here a bit. So right here we're seeing uh, this is my boy Riku, okay? Riku, not Rikku.

Rikku would be the girl from Final Fantasy X. I don't want you to get confused. Understand? Thank you, 'cause that was going to be my follow-up question. Mhm. So so here we got Kingdom Hearts HD Dream Drop Distance. Originally this came out on the 3DS a couple years back, okay? And it was called Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. Got it. It's the 3DS. H, got three dimensions. Dream Drop Distance. Got it. Yeah. All right, so chronologically this is the furthest along the timeline we've been so far, okay? This is past Kingdom Hearts. It's prepping you for Kingdom Hearts 3, but in in a very ancillary way, as Kingdom Hearts has been for the last decade. Mhm. All right, going forward a bit, you know, we just seen some more gameplay from it and that's cool and cute and it's looking good. It's looking HD for that's a 3DS game up-res. That's pretty impressive. Wow, that's really that's actually nice",

I actually did not play through Dream Drop Distance. Are you going to play through 3D? Nah, I think I'm okay. I'm read some summaries. The problem with with Kingdom Hearts is it's it's so vast at this point. There's so much going on that I'm super confused and it's like that's not really their fault, except it's entirely their um, I'm not sure anyone knows exactly what's going on in this trailer, but I'm happy that you know, hopefully somebody somebody does. So here Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, okay, is the earliest in the the timeline so far that of these games that have been released. That was a PlayStation Portable game, PSP, back in the day, right?

Mhm. Yeah. So here all happen when people sleep, right? Here we have what? No, okay, no. When they're when they're born, they go to war uh, and they go to sleep. It's very there's no sleep. Oh, the birth. I get what you're saying. I don't understand what's happening with not really not really sure. But so to clear things up for you, here we got the 0.2, okay? I don't know if you missed that. Oh, no, I saw that. I thought that was a date. I thought it was the date that it comes out. No, no, no, no, no. Birth by Birth by Sleep PlayStation Portable game. This is a kind of is the prologue. It's the Final Chapter Prologue, as they say in the title of the HD Remix 2.8 um, final chapter um, the and this",

Um, the and this math adds up if you think about it, right? 'Cause 0.2 plus 2.8 is three. Yes, that's awesome. Exactly. So we're going to get to three. So what this is is the story of Aqua from Birth by Sleep post-Birth by Sleep spoilers. I don't want to get too far into it, but she gets trapped in this place, right? She's here forever. She has to live her life out and stuff. What's interesting about this is this is it's kind of like when Metal Gear Solid gave us Ground Zeroes before The Phantom Pain. Sure. Okay, thank you. Um, or it's like a nice it's not a demo, but it's kind of just like a preview of what the game. Yeah, okay. Get your appetite a little bit. Or with Final Fantasy XV Episode Duscae. Mhm. Obviously, same thing there where it's just giving you a taste. So this is what Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to kind of look and play like.",

I'm a little confused with what's going on right here because this is Aqua, but in the background coming up, you see my boy Terra. I don't know how he's in there. How's he in this dream? This is this is so crazy, so crazy. So what do we on to? What is this? This is the final piece of 2.8. This is the kind of it, my understanding, it's a CG movie, okay? And I'm going to need to to look up some information here because all right, so recently there there was a mobile game in Japan in the foreign lands that uh, kind of dealt with the furthest backstory of Kingdom Hearts. So this is even pre-Birth by Sleep, pre-Keyblade War. This is before all the all the went down and uh, they recently ported that to American mobile phones calling in Kingdom Hearts",

It's actually the Greek letter Chi, okay? Yeah. So it's it's uh, you can kind of see it here. That's a this X is not an X. It's \u03c7. It's definitely \u03c7. So this is \u03c7 Back Cover, which is the the kind of the story of like the the five factions and the Foretellers. Mhm. Yeah. And um, it's uh, let me go through here. I'm trying to might be \u03c7, by the way. Is it \u03c7? Yeah, I think I think X, C H I I. Yeah, I think that's if it's an X, I think it's I think it's \u03c7. Kevin, can we get a check? See what Greek I remember I had a K. It might be K. Alpha. Was it this this little X? All right, \u03c7 Back Cover.

Quote me on that, I could be wrong. Fun browser or mobile games. I've been liking it a lot. Anyways, so all of this is setting up for Kingdom Hearts 3. Mhm. Um, I'm a little off-put by this section in particular. Like I'm not sure that I was really questioning the the backstory of Kingdom Hearts with like pre-Disney and all that stuff. I'm like, there's a distinct lack of Mickey here. I'm sure he'll get involved at some point. Yeah, I mean, maybe you don't know. Maybe it turns out like it's like Wicked, right? Where they go back and he wasn't the bad guy everyone thought he was Mickey. Yeah, he was just, you know, misunderstood.",

Okay, but we're see of all these people or no, no, these are all new. These are new characters, new characters because there this is like back back back back in time. So they're prepping for the Keyblade War. Got it. Don't remember why. Not sure it was ever made clear. I'm sure. Do you think do they ever take the masks off or is that just kind of like a thing that is that the masks are new? Okay. The masks are new. So we we'll have to you're you're doubting right now, but it might if it has the magic, you got to go with it.

It's the number eight. Yeah, that would be Arabic. What you call that? Sure. Yeah, that's an eight or an infinite on it side. No, but like what what is that called if this is a Roman numeral, what's this? What's what's it's the Standard Arabic. Yeah, we got so we got an Arabic eight. So that's cool. Then the most exciting part of this whole trailer, all jokes aside, bam, December 2016 worldwide. So we're getting this this year. So we're going to get a taste of what Kingdom Hearts 3 might actually play like for me via Birth by Sleep. What is new in this?

Great. Mhm. So and then the rest of it just for people who haven't played or remastered play 3DS version. 3DS and PSP. Yes, that sounds like a lot. It is. Sounds like for someone like me who might be wanting to jump into Kingdom Hearts, is this a good entry point for me? Absolutely not. This I think I'm just going to do it. I think I'm just going to do it. This is probably the worst the worst jump. Is it worse than when I decided just to play the last uh, Metal Gear Solid instead of play any? I think that makes a lot more sense than this. So what's weird about this is like I was joking earlier, the Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix or Remix 1.5, whatever, and 2.5.

So it's like I totally expected like the rumors before 2.8 were announced were that it was going to be called 2.9 and it was going to include everything and that would have been exciting. Yeah, that would have been real exciting. But here they're like, okay, the one thing we don't have is the 3DS game. Let's get that in there and just add a bunch of new. So I don't know. I mean, theoretically speaking, they could just keep adding decimal points. They could it could be 2.8.1 2.8. They work all the way up to I mean, it's infinite, right? Kevin, infinite.

Big Hero 6 World, Nick. We're getting Tangled World. I don't know what else is confirmed, but lock lock me in a dark room and uh, wake me when it's winter time. We're probably getting Frozen. Speaking of winter, we might get Star Wars. We might get Marvel. It's very true. It is all packed into Kingdom Hearts 2.8.1. No, this is three is the Big Daddy. Okay.
