What's up everybody? Welcome to another Kinda Funny Reacts from E3 2016. I'm one of your hosts Greg Miller alongside the Piero Tim Gettys. Let Tim host. And Tim Mhm. I can't believe it. You've touched the ethereal plane. You've played The Last Guardian. I played The Last Guardian. And let's stop and think about that for a second. That's a statement. That is not a joke. That is not a lie. That is a fact. That is something that happened. And I couldn't believe it. I waited a damn long time to play. 45minute demo. So you had to sit through a bunch of people for 45 minutes playing. So 45minute demo and I was like five people back. It was it was rough. But was it worth it? You'd already waited so long at that point. Exactly. That's the thing is it's like what's another year of waiting in line you know like",

That's the thing is it's like what's another year of waiting in line you know like whatever. Um it was it was worth the wait for sure. Like I I'm happy I did it. Yeah. Um the immediate thing is this is not getting one of my Game of the Year heads. It was a contender. It was a contender but it didn't wow me in that way. Okay. Very excited to play this game. Okay. So it it wasn't bad. Oh no no no no. It's definitely not bad but it it was this demo at least. And honestly it might have been that it was too long. Like I think that I I might have got too much of the game with also not getting enough of it you know? So it was kind of leaving me in a in a weird place. It's like the demo didn't really end in like a a way that powerful Bam now I want to play Guardian in October. It's kind of like all right you know it's the beginning of the game. You It was the first",

You It was the first 45 minutes and it's definitely like the tutorial. I will say it's really good for being a tutorial of a game. Okay. Like it's they handled it really well and like the the way you kind of learn how the controls work and the the climbing and uh interacting with the Trico and all that stuff. Yeah it it was very very very well done. Um I the game is not that pretty. It has a lot of graphical issues. Okay. Um like what because they they're doing an art style to it right? I mean it's or is that they're out. It's funny that it it really really really is similar to my discussion about Zelda that we were talking about where it's like it look it's a last gen game like and clearly clearly and it's it is you know the art style though does make up for it. It's it's a beautiful game in that sense but",

It's it's a beautiful game in that sense but uh there's a lot of just graphical issues like there's a lot of um glitchy things or things like his the shield kept popping away randomly and it's like he he'd go to grab it and it like just would disappear before it came to his hand or he gets on the ladder. It just the animations just kind of looked off and it wasn't consistent. I think that was the the bigger thing and a lot of weird random tearing everywhere enough for it to be distracting. I usually don't really care about that stuff. But I will say to turn that into a positive the game really did feel like a throwback to like the PS2 generation overall. You know like we had Ico and Shadow of the Colossus back then and those games are amazing and beautiful. This feels a bit more Ico than Shadow of the Colossus. Okay. Which is more what",

This feels a bit more Ico than Shadow of the Colossus. Okay. Which is more what exploratory wandering environments. A little bit more. At least what we played um is a little more confined you know and it's it's just you and the the the bird dog. Yeah bird dog. uh Trico and it's you know obviously just like Ico had had you and whatever but um Shadow of the Colossus is a little bit more open. You know you had the horse and you're going around but it was just like with this specifically a lot of the climbing the ladders climbing on the the Trico and all that stuff. It felt very much like Ico which is a good thing but it it just felt Is it something you want to play more of? Yes 100%. 100%. It's impossible for this game not to be underwhelming when you play a demo of it right? I think that's about emotional connection and telling a story and knowing all these",

I think that's about emotional connection and telling a story and knowing all these characters. So the thing there though is that it the game made me feel and I think that that that's why I want to keep playing it and that's why I think that it's going to be wellreceived when it comes out. I I don't think it's going to be as wellreceived as Shadow of the Colossus based on a little bit I played. That's the tough part. Yeah. Yeah. U because obviously you're right like you can't really judge this game. It's going to be really hard to review this game. Sure. I think because it is going to be it's it's very similar to me uh like a Flower um or a Journey but I think it's even more like the Flower side than the Journey. Journey was a little bit more fleshed out and Journey had a point of making you feel emotional. You know it's like it was building toward it was telling a story",

You know it's like it was building toward it was telling a story that was pretty obvious. You know what I mean? Like it's there's an obvious destination. You obviously doing something. Flower is a bit more open-ended where like you feel emotions from it but it's kind of what you put into it. And that's definitely this interacting the it's a game about the relationship between him and the and it's kind of like you and a pet you know but what's interesting about it is it the feelings it gets you aren't necessarily like oh it's loving it's a loving relationship. Kind of fear in a lot of ways. You're afraid of the bird dog. Yeah. Like cuz the bird dog um so in the demo it it it's hungry. It's it's it's like kind of like locked up. It's been shot. It's wounded. Okay. There's arrows in it and stuff. You're pulling the arrows out and it's freaking out",

You're pulling the arrows out and it's freaking out like an animal would. You know even if it's a pet that's your pet and you love it if it's injured and you're doing **** to it it's going to be like ah and growl and stuff. Um so but it's a giant thing. So the growling is really scary. And its eyes kind of change colors based on how uh it's feeling and its emotions and stuff. And through that there's a lot of storytelling. I think that's where this game excels is that it's it's non-verbal. lots of non-verbal communication going on. And that's it's fun because it it really it it's very engrossing the entire time. I'm just like constantly aware of where he was and I wanted to be near him. I didn't want to see I didn't want him to do anything. Yeah. But but that's the thing is it's it's like with with dogs it's like you miss them and",

But like um and the it acts really animallike and uh like pet-like specifically in a way that it's like just it doesn't it's not like an intelligent being of run being able to run off on its own. You can't trust it. Yeah. Exactly. So it's it's doing all this stuff. So when I was in like other rooms and stuff I was constantly like what's up? I'd go back and it was doing something else. Right. Eating out of trash. Um and it's like it's like scared of water cuz it has this like electric tail thing. So it didn't want to go in the water and stuff. So it's kind of like even though it's it's really hungry. That's the thing. So you have to you have to try to feed it but it doesn't want",

So you have to you have to try to feed it but it doesn't want to eat if you're handing it to it. So you have to put it down in front of it. And it's just like it's all these like little things that are super trivial. Interesting. But it just it adds up to being like really connecting with the character. But again I I got weirdly scared of the whole situation like and but I I like that though because it's like that that fear then turned into like a mutual respect between us you know? By the end of it Trico respected my boy. Um but it's I think that they're that they're definitely going to play with that a lot. And like seeing in the trailer there's two of them. It's like there's there's a lot of questions like where what's the point of this? Where are we going with this? And I think that we we'll get those answers. Um the game plays fine. Like it's",

Um the game plays fine. Like it's it's not that fluid controlling. I I felt a little bit like it's not one of those games where you play and you're like man everything I wanted it to do it did. It was more like h why aren't you grabbing that thing or all right the jump is not getting me where I need to go. I feel like it should be like that type of stuff. So it got the game got in its own way a lot um with the with the controls and the kind of mechanics. A lot of the it's very simple puzzles. It was the beginning of the game so I can't blame it for that. Imagine it getting harder but I also don't really see it getting that rewarding. And I think that's kind of the biggest worry for me because Shadow of the Colossus was so awesome in that sense. this the he has like a shield thing that could like emanate light and uh this the",

So I'm still I'm high on the game. It sounds like I'm being really negative. You're definitely making me feel like this is like what I predicted with The Last Guardian",

It's going to feel like it's last gen. I think that uh that that stuff like you just you got to put it aside. Like you need to not think about it taking this long to come out. Just enjoy it for what it is. Sure. Because if you do that if you don't think about the hype and whatever this is a great game. It's really seemingly sure um very beautiful artistic vision and like there's de they're doing something this it's different. It's definitely different you know and I think that they're they're committing to the vision that they have and I think that they are succeeding in that. It's just is that vision worth 10 years and all the hype of will it be at this press conference? Oh my god it is release stage this.",
