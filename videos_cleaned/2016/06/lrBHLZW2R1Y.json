What's up, everybody? Welcome to another Kinda Funny Reacts from E3 2016. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. Kia, Aries, Zeus, uh, God of War is back, Colin, and it's a little bit different looking. It is. What did you think of what we saw at the PlayStation PR conference? I'm excited about God of War for the first time, I think, really. Yeah, um, more narrative driven, it seems a little more somber, different setting, seems to be Norse. Yep. And the the the biggest parallel I can draw, even though it's unconfirmed because we haven't seen really any of the game other than what they've showed us at the conference, seems to take a page out of like Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider with like what seems to be connected areas. In other words, it doesn't seem like you're going through a linear set of areas over and over.",

We'll see why that is in a little while, but yeah, let's see if I can dial it up for you, 'cause obviously we've seen this demo. You've seen it somewhere else. You don't, but after beat this, ruh haa man. Yeah, there it is exactly. So like it says like, you know, uh, the areas discovered, Dothdotham Moone, I guess. Rolls right off the tongue. It is. It's very, very easy to say like most Norse things are, I guess. Uh, but I think the game looks really fun. This looks like a more, uh, like I said, a somber, story driven God of War. Kratos doesn't seem to be needlessly angry for no reason. I'm sure he's angry at some point. We see a little meter that indicates that he is. Yeah, when when his son screws up the hunt, he gets mad there for a second. And I feel like, um, I feel like I I I I can't",

And I feel like, um, I feel like I I I I can't, you know, overstate that the problem I had with God of War, the trilogy, not really playing God of War: Ascension very much, but the trilogy, um, was that the gameplay was great and it actually really fluid and actually a technical showcase for PlayStation and PlayStation 3, depending on the games you're talking about. But here's his rage, by the way, started to fill in. But they're just not that good like in terms of a narrative. Like there was no reason for me to keep playing. The gameplay wasn't good enough for me. The hook wasn't good enough for me in the gameplay for me to keep going, um, or want to keep going. I mean, I platinumed God of War on PS3 and God of War II and all that kind of stuff. But in other words, I just feel like this is a different God of War in a right direction. It's already giving us a Kratos",

It's already giving us a Kratos that I, when we kept saying that the rumor was it's going to be this Norse game, it's going to be this, I was expecting to be the original Kratos. When the people I had heard rumors of the bearded Kratos, and I was like, oh, we're picking up many years after the last game. I didn't expect it to be that we're going to step into new Kratos, a different, you know, a Multiverse where there's a Kratos here who isn't the God of War we know, similar in many ways, but he has a son, he had a wife clearly right here. And now he's out there teaching him. And if he can have that dynamic range of I'm trying, even in this thing, there's a great shot of, uh, when the kid kills the elk or whatever, and Kratos reaches out to comfort him and but then doesn't and pulls back and it's like, all right, you're still a dick, you're still",

Let me tell you, snap to that elk, Slim Jim. But even this, like the combat is God of War, but it's not, you know what I mean? As we're coming up here, the big thing I took away from the battle right here with this dude was how much it felt or looked, I should say, not felt like since I didn't play, uh, looked and felt like, uh, Dark Souls or Demon's Souls with, all right, now I have to dodge, I have to be artful, I have to not, I can't just get in there and screw them up and have my Blades of Chaos whipping around. I have one axe. I have to get in there and not get killed.

Yeah, it seems like it's a rebooted, it's not a literal reboot, obviously takes place within the canon, but it seems like a rebooted. I mean, you assume so. Why would Kratos be all old? And I don't think this is Kratos. I don't think it's our Kratos. I'm saying it's a Multiverse. I think they're restarting this guy, probably going to be called Kratos, but I don't think he's our Kratos. My theory is that he's somehow found, like it could be this nerdy Multiverse you're talking about, uh, but I I feel like the story will be more compelling if he somehow found himself in an older place in a different area of the world or in a different mythology being the same character. I mean, I don't know. My my whole thoughts are on, no, it's a complete reboot. Um, but either way, whether or not the",

Um, but either way, whether or not the story remains tangential or not at all associated with the with the original games, it's a smart idea to reboot it because I do think God of War was getting stale. The God of War III came out in 2010 and God of War: Ascension obviously was an attempt to kind of capture the moment of multiplayer madness or whatever. I think some people liked it, but it wasn't the God of War we were looking for. So they took a long break. Sony Santa Monica has been somewhat dormant. Um, obviously they had a major game canceled, um, in the interim that was a PlayStation 4 game that was that was canceled well into development. So it was a it was, you know, not that it was was this team that was actually Stig's game, um, who's working I think at Respawn now on Star Wars, correct?

And we'll see, we'll see like how it all pans out. But this is the first time I'm really excited about God of War. I mean, people that have been listening to us for years know know that that's an that's a first party IP I just couldn't give a about. So yeah, first impressions are super hot on it. I like what I see. I like where it's going. I like that it seems like it's more around it. I like that I think it is a complete reboot. I hate his little whiny ass kid though. It's it's so weird that if it is a complete reboot, which is possible, you're probably right, um, why why does he have to look the exact same? Because I think then that's the the canon of Kratos, right? In similar way to like how",

In similar way to like how James Bond always looks like James Bond, 'cause he has the because he has the Omega symbol always wearing, he's always wearing a thing. He has the Omega symbol on his back still, which is not Norse. So like that's, I mean, the other thing is that he also has Spartan Rage, which is a call back to what it is. But I mean, like I think the fact that he's not voiced by the same guy is like the first key. They never, you know, obviously this guy wouldn't call him Kratos or whatever. I think there's more to it than what we think. I don't I I think it my initial thought was, yeah, it was going to be I climbed off this rock after getting stabbed, went off and found, oh, now I find these Norse creatures and I'm going to kill them.

And he was so overblown and so over the top. And I don't think you can take that into this world and be like, all right, cool, now it all make sense, right? Like we're going to mash it up and make you care about this kid, your kid, and apparently his mom who's gone now or whatever. We're going to make you care about it. I don't think it works that way. Yeah, I think tonally they're they're striking a different chord, which resonates more with me. Yeah, and I think it will resonate more with a lot of people, not to say God of War was disappointed to a lot of people because it wasn't, no.

But I'll be interested to see as we go on. Well, I'm sure we'll get more information on the story and and all of that to give us a little bit of context. But meanwhile, I mean, this is definitely a look at God of War we've never seen before. Uh huh. 100%. Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, what do you think? Is this the Kratos we know and love or is it a rebooted Kratos? Let us know in the comments. Share this video with your friends. And of course, keep coming back here all weekend long or I guess week long to youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames because we're putting up all sorts of E3 content from the show floor. Until next time, I'm Greg, that's Colin, Kevin behind camera. We love you. Bye.",
