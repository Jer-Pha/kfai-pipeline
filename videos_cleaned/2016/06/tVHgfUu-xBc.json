What's up guys? I'm Tim Gettys. This is Greg Miller. Hey. The E3 of Dreams. Year of Dreams has happened. Sony's press conference ended. Yeah. Here is our Kinda Funny Reacts for Death Stranding, the new Kojima game. Oh my god. He came out like a majestic. It was one of those where I got scared. We did the E3 predictions episode of PS I Love You XOXO, which we do these predictions annually, as you know. And I made the prediction that Kojima would come out and he would show at least concept art, maybe a teaser trailer. And then this morning, the news was like, \"Oh, Kojima doesn't even have an engine yet.\" And I was like, \"God, no. That's bad. That's not what I expected.\" And then sure enough, he comes out and he's like, \"We have something to show you.\" And we get invisible hands, Norman Reedus walking over",

That's not what I expected.\" And then sure enough, he comes out and he's like, \"We have something to show you.\" And we get invisible hands, Norman Reedus walking over here. And then we get him attached to a baby. And let me tell you, like when they did this panning over him here and they came up here and they saw the awesome handcuffs, little electrified handcuffs. I was like, okay, cool. And then you see this baby and you're like, okay, what? That's very much, very much Kojima. Okay, it is. That's the PS3 baby. But then this here, I was like, this body type looks like Snake. And I was like, is he going to do some? And then I was like, no, it's Norman Reedus. It's happening. And I was like, Garo is gonna burst through a wall in a second. I'm like, oh my god, I'm loving this, man. I'm loving the vibes from this whole thing. And I personally, I love this type of stuff. Like, what do you think is it going to be? I don't know. But I like, I like sci-fi, right? Yeah. And I mean, here's",

There's a lot of weird **** going on. Very, very Kojima. Yeah, of course. Lot of love there though. But happened to Hideo Kojima at some point and I'd love for him to tell me about it or a therapist somewhere along the line. But I mean, man, this is just interesting looking. You know, I'm sure we're going to get a whole bunch of 15-minute long CG trailers and **** over the next couple years, but man, no, it was, it was, you know, we talked about on PS I Love You tonight. Yeah, I know. I saw them on tonight, of course, our reactions to it. And Colin's point was, you know, they didn't need this and it's, it's actually may work against them because now every",

What an unexpected thing. I mean, I called it, but what an unexpected thing of like, I called it thinking it wouldn't happen or whatever. But then again here, these five pillars, what's going on? We got these five dudes up here who are clearly killing all the seas and and all the whales and all the fish. **** you, mother nature. You don't like me. Remember when you said you want, you want to be with Norman Reedus, huh? 2016's the year. 2016's the year, Greg. Yeah, they do. Man, they gave us a lot. I'm liking this a lot.

Uh, the song also really cool, nice tone for the whole thing. Kojima always has to give credit to to the artist and stuff. I really, really respect that. Interesting that it's not like the normal group of people have the Donna Burke, not the sure, you know that I, from what I understand, Konami owns them. Donna Burke is owned by That's not true. That's not true. Norman Reedus and like, I was so waiting for it written by. But uh, yeah, man. Loving it. We got a, we got a title. We got a See how these guys have umbilical cords attached to their stuff, too. Yeah, there's some, some stuff's going on here. Death Stranding. Really weird name. Yeah, but it's, it's Kojima, so what do we expect? Yeah. What do you expect? Um, Silent Hills, you know, it's, it was a thing, but now Did you pause it here? Yeah, I did.

The technical producer, Mark Cerny. But I, I was, I was looking through it all real quick. I was like, where, where's Guillermo del Toro? Get out of here. The cone of shame. This goddamn cone of shame from E3 2016. There we go. Awesome. Congratulations. Is that your boy Ken? Yeah, that's my boy Ken. What up, Ken? Good to see you as always. Ken, if you, if you're not following Ken on Twitter, everybody should go follow Ken on Twitter because wherever Kojima goes, he goes and he's all the inside scoops and what's happening.
