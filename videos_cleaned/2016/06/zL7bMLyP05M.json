What's up everybody, welcome to another Kinda Funny Reacts from E3 2016. I'm one of your host, Greg Miller, all alongside king of the gingerbread men, Colin Moriarty. Why are you messing my neighborhood, Colin Moriarty? How many, we've been doing this for like almost a decade, but do you understand that half the things I do, don't know you, I do on purpose. You didn't do that on purpose. Colin Moriarty, Colin Moriarty, Horan Horan mocker Colin. Yep, you saw God of War. I saw God of War behind closed doors. What did you think? Super impressive, right? Um, we listened to Cory talk about the game. Cory Barlog obviously is a, you know, an OG of the God of War series that left Sony Santa Monica and then came back. And to me, what I felt like this game being like, basically this game exists as a response everything that was",

And to me, what I felt like this game being like, basically this game exists as a response everything that was wrong about God of War. It wasn't like he talked about stuff and would look at us about it. And the fact that like, we, you ever been, he was looking at me, it was very clear that we have said on multiple occasions, we've been, Kratos is a terrible character, he is one-dimension. These are the problems with him. And he had talked about the fact that this is Kratos, like the way he described the game is interesting. It is a reimagining of God of War, but of the gameplay, but a continuation of the story. Kratos, this is the Kratos we've known forever. However, lots of time has passed between his Greek God era and now his Norse era, right? And this is him, well, this is the first God of War from a story perspective, I'm actually super excited about the way he talked about. Yeah, dimensionally, I think that like, you know, to your",

Yeah, dimensionally, I think that like, you know, to your point, there was some confusion. I know you were confused when we were talking about, we're talking about the game where after we saw it at the press conference. Yeah, it is a continuation because I had noted he has like the Omega symbol and it's called Spartan Rage, that guy self. So I'm like, are they really gonna like call it all that and then reboot it? So, so the instincts that some people had, I think before they've confirmed it was right that this is a continuation and there's a reason an arc in the story about how he gets to Scandinavia, which we'll explore in the game. But I feel like, you know, Cory talked about it as like the, you know, one through three, and I guess you can count like, you know, the Ready at Dawn games as well as being kind of the first act of Kratos.

Kratos is angry and knows me as a reason to be angry, but now like he has to kind of change. Yeah, and so along with the change in his temperament comes the change in game is what in the game as well. The structure of the game, the camera angle, combat, everything's changed. This game is much less of what I feel like is a game trapped in the PS2 and PS3 era, which is like that, you know, these anchored camera, yeah, these static interaction, no story. Yeah, like it, like God of War just, I mean, in my opinion, I just, I know it's a technical showcase of those consoles as we've said many times, but they just don't age well from a from a narrative perspective, has always been garbage. Please been fun. Yeah, the gameplay is fine. I think I mean, I enjoy playing the God of War games, but this seems to be a third-person action game in the vein of",

I think I mean, I enjoy playing the God of War games, but this seems to be a third-person action game in the vein of some of the great third-person action games that we've been getting the last five years or so. And God of War taking a long break from the canon, you know, Ascension, I guess isn't there somewhere too, but taking a long break and kind of figuring out what what this game could be is is really interesting to me. And I felt someone validated in a sense when he like was like, it's like the game is like Tomb Raider, right? I was like, that's exactly what I said. The game question was, what is the open-world is, right? He talked about the game being broad and what he came back with is it's it's a little bit bigger than what the Tomb Raider open areas were. Were you walking to someone, you have freedom to explore and do whatever, but you're in that area, you're still locked down to that area while you do it and then",

But you, I mean, are you, so you're not the only one that felt like he was just looking at, you know what I'm saying, certain **** like, you know, just heard us talk **** about Kratos, but right. And I think that was the thing he talked about how we were getting, we had longer, our demo session had the longer intro, right? I think some of that might be just because we are so vocal about it. But again, it worked in the fact of coming out and being like, in a way, it was a speaking to the point that I was making in the trailer, right? Or the demo reaction, I guess, of the Spartan Rage filling up and then Kratos trying to call him down and talk to his son and then reaching out and think it's this Kratos trying to find humanity is interesting. He's lost from it, right? He's angry",

He's lost from it, right? He's angry because he has this life that he doesn't want. He's angry because he can't die, he can't be killed. And like Cory brought up, you know, God of War I starts with him trying to kill himself and it's impossible. And so he's not, he gave up on that fact. He had given in to that this is his life, went off on this search for himself and somehow ended up here now in Scandinavia, now having to deal with all this Norse mythology, having a mother to his child at some point, figure out now how that works. Yeah, and I think one of the interesting kind of things about this is, you know, to Cory's point about, you know, when people think about Norse mythology, they think it's something about Vikings. I certainly do. Yeah, me too. And he was saying that it's more of the migration period before the Vikings that this",

And he was saying that it's more of the migration period before the Vikings that this takes place in when when in Norse mythology, when the Vikings thought the time had existed when the gods walked the earth. So that's a really cool kind of narrative angle that they're taking in. Savage monsters, right? Exactly. So I really feel like they've hit on something really unique and special here. And by taking God of War off the market for a while, I'm thinking about what it could be. And he was saying like, nothing was sacred to the team. Like everything, I really liked when he said that, everything that the game that God of War was, even if it's made its way into the new game, had to be defended. Like nothing was there just because we felt like it needed to be there. Had to be defended. I'm gonna had it there. Had to be a point to bringing it there. And so I think that what you see in this new God of",

And so I think that what you see in this new God of War is there's there's deeper mechanics and systems, role-playing like systems. And there was always, there was upgrading in the God of War games, but this seems to be like you're earning experience points, you're finding new locations, you're collecting things. There are a little side quests and all sorts of things in the game that I think are gonna make a more cohesive experience, make it a more well-rounded game, make it feel more than what the other God of War games did feel like, which were fun action games. But now again, yeah, this is being pulled into that third-person realm Sony's now known for. And what I found fascinating that I didn't think of based on the demo is that your son is with you the whole time, it sounds like. Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, exactly. You get to command your son now and tell him when they",

You get to command your son now and tell him when they were to didn't show this, but I might when you go into a fight of 13 guys and two of them are super strong, you get to make that tactical choice of, alright, I'm as Kratos gonna go fight these two guys and I'll tell my son to go fight the other guys or I'll have my son, you know, take on the little guys or they'll help me out. And it's basically all it is is you point the camera whatever you want the kid to do and you hit square and your son goes into it or your boy is crazy. The one takeaway that I have above all else, I think is that I'm for the first time in God of War since God of War came out in 2005, I'm excited about it. Yeah, I'm like really looking forward to it now. I played the God of War games, but and I beat God of War I and God of War II, never got through three and never got through",

Like this is, I'm like, this this seems to be, this seems to solve a franchise that I think needed salvaging, if not from a sales perspective, in a critical perspective, just from a **** like heart and soul perspective. Kratos is a definitively shitty character. And I don't mean like he's a shitty person. Like we always talk about, you know, Don Draper and Mad Men or Tony Soprano on The Sopranos as being like bad guys that you can root for. They are dimensional though. They have they like they have depth and everything. Yeah, like and to me like Kratos is just an awful **** character that there's nothing about him that I root for or root against. I just think he exists and he's just one-note, one-dimension. And Cory said he's like, we know that he was",

And Cory said he's like, we know that he was one-note and we know that it was overdone. Yeah, and like that was really vindicating to hear like people over the years be like, you guys are crazy, Kratos was a great character. Well, the guys that like really were responsible for Kratos are even saying that maybe it's like enough now. The anger was enough. Yeah, exactly. So I think they never go on our board of Sammys being very clear, but he cleanly, but in speaking plainly, I mean, he was speaking plainly that like they know. Yeah, it's gonna be fascinating how to look at this, look at Kratos and step back after this game or when we have this game and if it really is Act One where it was the three games, and I'm not including anything, you know what I mean, the Sony Santa Monica three games, you know what I mean, the narrative. And then we jump to this Act Two and",

And then we jump to this Act Two and it is now he's going through and how does he do this and what is his son and what did this the what did this, you know, the woman that bore his child, what did that mean to him? And we have a new thing here. It's not just hung up on Calliope. I'm like, Calliope, I'm interested to see how, you know, he went out here thinking he'd be alone and clearly he found other people and found this. Like, I'm interested in getting that backstory and seeing how that all progressed. Me too. I think that they they're doing a really nice job over there. Super excited to play it. It's interested in it's it's hard to know because of the canceled Sony Santa Monica project, the the fabled, you know, space game that was canceled well into development that was Stig's game.

Apparently Stig now, what where is he now? Respawn, Respawn, right? Working on Titanfall 2, oh, Star Wars. That's right. So it's hard to know if these games were developed in tandem, if one kind of gave way to the other, like what's going on. And oh, the reason I bring that up is because it's hard to know from these vertical slices that we're seeing where where these games are. Yeah, in their development. Yeah, because obviously the team peels off and really refines and polishes these parts. I saw, you know, that's the same case in the part of the Horizon I play it too. And it's just hard to know if this game is sooner rather than later. I'm not saying it's this year because it's not, but is it first half of 2017? Is it Fall 2017? Is it after that? Like, I don't Fall 2017. Yeah, anchor a great true PlayStation exclusive that people are going to be excited. God of War",

Yeah, anchor a great true PlayStation exclusive that people are going to be excited. God of War back. Yeah, so I think it's a game worth keeping an eye on. Obviously, they'll roll out things as it makes sense for them. But I was really, as good as the game looks, I was really excited to hear Cory talk about it because I thought he talked about it really one of the eloquent, smart thinkers that I've ever met and in the industry. And I think that he he seems to be able to take us, it's hard to take a step back from something that like when we do our podcast and we and it's hard to hear criticism about the things that you love and that you built wherever. But sometimes you have to step back and hear criticism to make things better. And it seems like that was the entire initiative with this game.

And they've done all that. And I think that there's a lot to be excited about. It feels like the next step for it in terms of God of War growing up. And I don't think that saying that is an insult. And I don't think it's a, you know, crazy comparison to say it's because Cory's grown up, right? He came out and talked about stepping away from Sony Santa Monica, working with a bunch of different people and then having his son and coming back and having in, you know, now making this game. He's in a different place. He's in the same way if David Jaffe was to go make God of War now, he'd be in a much different place than he was with Cabrera, right?

So I guess that's fine. It's just it's cool that we're gonna get depth of Kratos. I really do think characters require it, you know, if you're gonna have a game like this, I don't think you can have a character like Kratos anymore. You need to make me care. Yep. And there needs to be stakes and more than just like, well, they killed his family. It's like, alright, I get it. Like my shoes are glued to him.
