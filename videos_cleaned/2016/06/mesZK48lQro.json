Greetings and salutations, welcome back to GameSpot E3 stage, but we're Kinda Funny, kind of. There's a little bit of a mixture here, a little bit of an amalgamation. I'm Colin Moriarty, I'm joined by Tim from Kinda Funny as well, my uh comrade, as well as Chris Watters from GameSpot. Guys, thank you for joining us. But the man of the hour, of course, Aaron Greenberg from Microsoft. Let's give a round, give yay. Now Aaron, before we get into it, many congratulations on what I thought was an extremely strong conference yesterday. Uh, you guys firing on all cylinders, software, hardware, first party, third party. So congratulations on that. Well, thank you. You know, we do a lot of work on the show and many months preparing, and then we sort of cross our fingers and hope everything technically works, every demo, every video, and then then we wait and see",

So what were you able to, you guys crunched a lot in there. I mean, there's two hardware announcements technically. Um, just to get I guess the big one out of the way, Scorpio. Can you tell us anything about this? I mean, we know it's coming late 2017. It's going to be the new iteration of Xbox One or Xbox. Uh, is this exciting internally? Are you guys stoked? Incredibly exciting. I mean, I've been on Xbox since we launched the original console, and it feels in many ways we're getting back to like the core of what Xbox and the brand started with was being about power, being about building incredible games that we love, investing in Xbox Live. And for me, you know, to be able to unveil a new console is a very special thing. You'd only sort of get to do that you",

You'd only sort of get to do that, you know, once in a few years. Be able to do two consoles and one briefing, uh, maybe something we never see again. So, uh, yeah, to open the briefing with the Xbox One S and then to close it with Scorpio was, um, I think somewhat historic. And so I think we'll look back, this will be a really special E3 for us. The response has been great. You know, the the the thinking for us was, I mean, maybe a little bit nontraditional, say, hey, we're launching Xbox One S this holiday, a lot of great updates and features there. But why would we announce Project Scorpio now? But we want our developers to be, you know, aware and be prepared for what's coming. And as we sort of thought deliberately about what's that next step change in hardware performance to be able to bring true 4K games to the living room, to the console, um, is",

And we know that requires a massive upgrade in power and performance. And so that's why we're uh bringing a console that can do six teraflops, that can also do High Fidelity VR. Um, and you know, a lot of those experiences do exist today on the PC for people that are spending thousands of dollars on gear. Um, but to bring that to the console market, uh, something we're really excited about. And so we're sharing that now, uh, but we know still quite a bit of work on the games and experiences between now and then. Awesome. I thought the I thought the messaging was was super on point with all that stuff.

And I think that, uh, you did a really good job of kind of going through all that stuff and building the excitement. But I also think that the Scorpio thing as the one more moment was really powerful because we all, I mean, we we've heard rumors, right? There's been leaks, there's been this, there's been that, uh, about both the the S and the the Scorpio. But to see both of them at this this, uh, press conference, I think is a very strong message, especially with the Beyond Generations thing that you guys are pushing where it's like, look, this is the plan. If you're planning on buying an Xbox, you can consider all of this stuff. You can get one",

And I think that's a that's a really good message to put out there. Yeah, we were really thoughtful about it. And you're right, you know, we are gamers, so we watch briefings, we watch our own briefing back, and we kind of put it through the lens of what would our fans and customers want to see. And we know, you know, it's more show than tell. It's try to be transparent about what we're doing. And so we were really thoughtful about that. Um, so I'm glad that that, um, that that, uh, that resonated. We had a lot of news. And so, um, but I think, you know, both to be able to say, listen, it's not just about bringing a smaller box, but there's actually going to be",

We know a lot of people are buying 4K TVs today. There is a purpose and a reason why we're doing Xbox One S to be able to give, you know, 4K video streaming, to be able to give support 4K Blu-ray, which, you know, people are spending $3, $400, $400 plus on 4K Blu-ray players. Starting at $299, we've got a great value for you if you're in the market just for that before you get to games. HDR gaming, if you've seen games in HDR, uh, it looks incredible. And I know a lot of the new 4K TVs are supporting HDR. So really, there's a lot of great functionality there and a lot of great, um, benefits. But then as gaming goes, you're right, you hit on that point, uh, which is it's not about creating a new generation for us. And that's kind of the history.

It's about what if we could actually create a world where there are no longer console generations? What if we could actually let you play the games you already own and give you more value and allow you to play those across multiple devices? As gamers, we know we don't always just sit in our living room and play on our console. But if we could save the games in the cloud and allow you to keep playing no matter what device you're on, what if all your accessories worked? And, you know, it's like that was the vision. And we just dreamed it up and then we're like, well, let's go make this happen. I think the accessories thing is a a very like under underlooked at mentioned there at the press conference because it's like that's huge, you know, like when even when you look at like things like phones, it's so frustrating when they change the accessories, then you",

So being able to like look forward to the future and know what's coming and still be able to use the things you have is really good. Yeah, and that was really deliberate. So we know people are buying games today, they're buying accessories today. The new Xbox One S, for example, has a new controller, very very similar in design to the existing controller, which we know people love. But we added Bluetooth to that, for example. So as part of that, now that controller, I can go, you know, to work, to school, on the road, and it will pair and work with my Windows 10 PC. And those games that I have in my digital collection now also will play there. Our titles as part of this new Xbox Play Anywhere program. So that's the idea. It was started as a vision.

And it sort of sounds great to say that, but then like, what do we actually do to prove that? And so I think you're seeing a little bit of the proof of that vision. And, uh, and it's a it's a long vision that we're continuing, continuously innovating, continually going to be focused on this. And hopefully people are seeing a bit of that payoff this year. And one of the things that's sort of part of that vision, you know, you talked about people buying 4K TVs, buying these sort of the next generation of that technology. How have you given some thought about how, okay, you can tell people that the new the Xbox systems are compatible with and thrive in this environment, but then they also have to have the TV to get it?

Uh, you know, how are you guys sort of thinking about how do we convince people it's worth it to go 4K, to to get that extra HDR processing and stuff like that? Sure. Well, first, we still have a lot of people today that own an Xbox 360, tens of millions that have not upgraded to Xbox One yet. So if they were waiting for that moment in time, there's never been a better time to do that. You get a console that is 40% smaller, the power brick integrated. You want to lay it horizontal, you want to stack it up vertically, you can do that as well. So, and then we say, listen, we know whether you have a 4K TV or not, it's 4K ready for you. So when you do upgrade to that 4K TV, it's there. It will upscale, uh, your content to 4K, whether it's native or not. And then all the 4K video, 4K Blu-ray, and if you have a 4K TV that supports HDR, are, you know,",

So you get that benefit whether you're ready for it now or you're investing. People own consoles for years, uh, you know, you know that it's future proof. Are you rocking the 4K in your household currently? I'm not 4K yet. Not yet. So I'm 4K at work, so I'm sort of like, I get the experience as a work, you know, but, uh, I'm I'm thinking about doing it this holiday. Can you break down the HDR thing for me? Like, what does that? I know what that means in photography, but what exactly does that mean when it comes to TVs and consoles? I love a lot of people are like, yeah, as a photographer, I know what it means, but in game, well, first off, we have people that we work with and I've sat down with these guys that you guys know,",

He could talk to you for an hour about HDR alone. This is my and I talk to them and I've seen the games as a common consumer is the way I kind of think about it. So it's high dynamic range. The, uh, it will, you know, your whites, your blacks, the colors, the vibrancy just looks better. And so, for example, there's a scene in Gears of War 4 where you go up and look at the Moon. We've done side by side with HDR on and HDR off. You can tell the shine of the Moon, the color of the Moon, the brightness of the Moon looks significantly better when you have that HDR on. Now, if you never saw it, you go like, wow, this game looks beatable. The Moon looks beatable. But for people that care and notice, uh, there is a level of difference.

Um, and so, you know, suggest perhaps going to the internet and reading more and getting a super deep dive because you can spend like an hour going into the benefits of HDR. A lot of the new 4K TVs support that. And so we really wanted to offer kind of the cutting edge of that technology this holiday and at a great and at a great price. We were we were talking about Xbox One S. Should we show? I mean, as opposed to tell? Yes, thank you. Well, you should you should work on our team. Uh, well, I do have one. Uh, this is our new first. You might notice no, even the box is smaller, the actual packaging. Uh, I think the team did a great job with this. Uh, I will and this will be my first ever.

Uh, I don't know, there maybe there's space for a potential pack-in game, uh, situation. No, no comment, no comment. You build this with flexibility in mind. Uh, and then, you know, I'll tell you personally as a gamer, the thing I love the most about this is that I want to be really gentle with this thing, is that you could actually put this in your laptop top or messenger bag. So you'll see it's the team is calling robot white. So it's a it's a unique white. Uh, you can see all the ports on the back. I'm showing it to you and I got to realize will probably be a little more courteous to the viewers at home. You get a sense of all the different ports we have here on the back. Here it comes.

A couple things that we heard from fans are really important to them was that they wanted to be able to do their binding of their controllers. You want to rebind your controller, put that right here on the front, on the front. And, um, also has the power button, which does light up. And then, of course, with the stand, you can also stack it, um, if you prefer that. So I'll set this thing here right now. So the big question is, is it coming in black? It is coming in robot white. Robot white. Yes. Okay. Yes. So we we're we moving from from we're going from the darkness to the light. We've gone to the light. We're on the dark side. We're now we've now seen the light.

Speaking of controllers, I thought one of the coolest announcements was actually the customization of the controllers that you guys were doing internally, which I think is really a really remarkably good idea. Almost so obvious that I don't understand why no one was doing it. Well, so many people have asked about it. A lot of people are doing a lot of, you know, things aftermarket and all that. So we sort of said, hey, what if we could let you go to our website, go in and like customize every, you know, what about you want to change the color of the buttons or you want to change the colors of the D-pad or put your favorite school team, your favorite game, like whatever it may be?

And like, we've never been able to offer that for for gamers. And so to to do that with the controller, I think it's great. You put your gamer tag, whatever. I got to confess, I was a little bit, you know, I I got a controller. I got a controller. I feel fine with this. But then I went on the website and started clicking through all the colors.

Yeah, I think with ReCore specifically, you had mention it. I think you would explore the $40 price point with Rare Replay last year, right? That was and I think that you guys, it's clever, I think, and smart to do that at the middle ground, the space between, you know, like the $50 game and the $60 game. Well, I think the $40 game is a place. And and Sony had recently did it with Ratchet. But I think that Rare Replay was really the first example since the the so-called budget game that everyone kind of disparaged back in the day. And I think it's a a good place to be. So I'm excited to play ReCore. I, as everyone knows, Inafune is like my dude. So yeah, yeah, I think that it is a place if we tried",

I think that it is a place if we tried to do that. We've been both of Rare Replay and the Gears Ultimate Edition, but you know, Rare Replay being a brand new game in that case. So yeah, we had a lot of success with it. The title did very well for us and and uh we're hoping to see the same for ReCore. Cool. One another key, another key point you guys hit on was uh some improvements to Xbox Live and that's sort of, I mean, you know, for the past decade and a half of Xbox, that's always been an ongoing battle for you guys. It's to push the boundaries of that and make it a more more social, more accessible, more user-friendly system.

Yeah, so I mean, I think people know the magic of Xbox Live just playing with your friends, having a group of friends you love to play with and different friends like to play different types of games. So the two things to really focus on, one is bringing Clubs to Xbox Live to be able to create those groups of friends, but then how do I actually find people have similar interest? And that's the whole idea with with Looking for Group. And we've seen other games like Destiny and you talk about benefits for Overwatch. And so we think it's going to be, we think it'll be really popular with the community. We have a massive community obviously on Xbox Live and so we're excited to bring those uh later this fall.

I mean, Competitive Gaming is now booming and obviously we're participating that on our titles, but how can we also bring a lot of that so that it works across the platform so that tournament operators and our partners like EA, what they talked about doing with FIFA, can also take advantage of that as well. So just deeper integration, I think, is going to be a good thing and make it easier for for players with Arena.

But sort of the start of that is that first we want to be able to build it because right now we want to simplify that process. So when we Halo World Championships, for example, we worked with ESL, we worked with MLG, we worked with Gfinity, depending on which market. So we had, you know, four or five different tournament operators. You had to go to their website, their rules, sign up offsite. It just it made it made, you know, this Competitive Gaming experience way too complicated. If you can do it right from your dashboard, sign up, track your tournaments, how are you performing?",

Kind of reminded a lot of us, you know, back to kind of maybe like an indie version of like where BioShock started back in the day. Um and so they're bringing that to Game Preview July. We're really excited to be working with Compulsion on that. Uh it's a super innovative title.

I don't know exactly what their background was, but I know that the title is being built so that the levels are procedurally generated. Um and the the fit and finish there is actually pretty tight for a game that's going into into Preview. Uh and the gameplay is incredible. Yeah, I'm getting serious Ken Levine vibes from that game, which is always good. Exactly. And then of course we have Inside, which is coming first to Xbox One, uh which I know people are, you know, really excited about.

We're now selling millions and millions of those games on in the store for these, you know, largely very small, you know, kind of development studios.

My question for you, one of the things I think is fascinating that you guys are doing and your competitor is doing it as well, is exploring first party but using partners. Um even publishers and studios other publishers actually own. So I was actually really fascinated with Halo Wars 2 in Creative Assembly, which is a Sega studio making a Xbox game and a PC game. How do you guys kind of identify Capcom Vancouver, the same with Dead Rising? So how do you guys identify these different partners to work with within the ecosystem of your coalitions and your 343s?

And so to be able to go to PlatinumGames and have them be able to make a title exclusively for us with Scalebound or the work we did with Remedy on Quantum Break or even, you know, titles that aren't that big, what we did with Moon Studios on Ori, you know, and so there's a lot, there's a big opportunity there. We'll continue, we see that it's a really important part of our first party business where we are public working with those top developers and publishers.

Um and uh you know, we launched the beta this week so people at home can actually play the multiplayer beta this week, a taste of it.

Yeah, I always I always found that deal especially interesting of Microsoft having going to go to another publisher and then be like, your developer will make a game exclusive for us.

There could be a multiplayer map or certain game mode or things where we do bring in smaller or other external devs to help with some of the because just the tonnage of how much needs to get done as you don't see that, but we actually take the whole game and go out to them. Uh yeah, maybe it's a little non-traditional, but ultimately we think it's the right decision because, you know, when you're going to make an RTS in the Halo Universe, do we want to do that internally as a team that's specializing in making FPSs or we want to go give it to the masters of making an RTS game?
