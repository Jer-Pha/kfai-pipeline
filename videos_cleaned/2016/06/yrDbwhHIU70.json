What's up guys? I'm Tim Gettys. This is Colin Moriarty. Now Colin, hmm, you haven't seen this yet, have you? No. Okay, so now the new Cuphead, so we're about to show you, is Cuphead platformer gameplay. We know there's boss fights. We know that it essentially was a boss rush mode in forever, but now they're going back, they're adding in platforming things. That's where I am taking a bit longer. IGN had the exclusive reveal of this stuff. I want to run through with you, see what you think, because I'm of a couple minds here. One, this is what I wanted. I wanted this game to have platforming sections, but seeing this, I'm not sure I was correct in that. Yeah, I mean, I mean, my first instinct, really busy. Mm-hmm. Not not the aesthetics, amazing, but it seems a little bit a little bit busy to me, but I mean, it looks awesome. It looks amazing, but my",

Not not the aesthetics, amazing, but it seems a little bit a little bit busy to me, but I mean, it looks awesome. It looks amazing, but my worry here is that it's it seems like it's designed like a Mega Man stage where there's things happening. You kind of need to dodge all of that. Like it's more about jumping over the pits and not hitting the enemies, but it is about necessarily like, you know, crazy ass platforming. Um, and you can see you have HP down the lower left corner and see that the music's awesome. Presentation overall is fantastic, but I worry that it's a little too simple. You know, you've seen a lot of the same that I think the the charm of this game is obviously its art style, but when you see the same animations over and over and over, it kind of loses like seeing this thing jump up and down, then all of a sudden it just starts feeling like, oh, that's like Mario. Well, to me, I mean, yes, so the word was that they took the game",

Well, to me, I mean, yes, so the word was that they took the game back and, you know, got some additional funding and time to make do something like this. This is what people wanted. But I mean, it's not that it looks simple to me. I'm sure, I mean, the person is playing the game is very good and I'm sure it's not gonna be very hard either. But it's just that it doesn't my first instinct on this is at the design there doesn't seem to be like a rhyme or reason for the way the way the enemies are placed. I don't think the enemy diversity is that great either, but it seems like things really really on top of each other. The game I want the game to be more zoomed out. This is a huge problem we had on Super Nintendo actually when the pic when when the sprites got bigger. Was it Mega Man 7? You had that problem in Super Metroid. You had the problem where the game looked too",

You had the problem where the game looked too zoomed in because the characters were too big. So it comes zooming it out and I just feel like across a phobic with all the enemies. But but I don't know. I'm still gonna play this organ. That's my thing is I'm so excited for this game and it's just like it just it kind of like seeing this. I thought I was going to be super jazzed about it and I'm kind of like a little more trepidatious now. But looking at it, it does give me a nice vibe of the the Aladdin and the Lion King and the Mickey's Magical Quest, whenever like that that era of platforms. You're like Super Nintendo, Genesis games. So like that's cool. And in terms of difficulty, like I hope that there's like a nice ramp up and what we've seen from the bosses, they are impossibly hard. So hopefully this there's more more to see from this.",

Yeah, I feel like there's there's a lack of I gotta watch for one time say I just don't feel like there's a coherent design philosophy here in terms of like the backgrounds look great. The enemies look awesome. Everything looks great. I just don't understand. But that's my first instinct. I mean, I can watch it more time. So maybe when I go hands-on with it, all you have a better grasp of. But that's my first insects still. I mean, what a novel idea for a game. Oh, super. I'm super stoked about though. It's a really really cool idea. The Microsoft was smart to identify this one early. Yep. We'll be seeing E3 this week. Hopefully the Microsoft press conference to see maybe",
