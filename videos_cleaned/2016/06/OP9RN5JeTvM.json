What's up everybody? I'm Greg Miller and this is the pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. It's good to be here with you, Colin. Colin, we're behind closed doors at the PlayStation Booth. You, this is it, this is the whole Booth. This is the whole Booth. You got to just go see Detroit: Become Human behind closed doors. Tell me everything. You know how excited I am. It's awesome. It's really cool. I think this is going to be well indicative of what we've seen so far. I don't want to, you know, state much beyond. Beyond: Two Souls was a big disappointment, I think for a lot of people, for me and you. Yeah, just speaking personally, it previewed fine, but I had my reservations about it even before it came out. Um, and then when it came out, it just wasn't up to Heavy Rain standard, right? Quantic Dream obviously made Heavy Rain one of the great PS3 exclusives, one of",

Quantic Dream obviously made Heavy Rain one of the great PS3 exclusives, one of the really great games on that console. This game seems like a return to form and is really, really, really cool and I really think you're going to dig it. So what, what's happening? What did you see? What made it cool? So we saw the same thing that we saw in the trailer, uh, the Android. They played it twice and both times they played it, actually different things happened. And so basically what they were trying to show was how little things in the environment and little things you do can, can affect the outcome. Okay, so by the way, Shuhei, right? Hey, Shuhei, you want to come here? Come get a hug on camera. Come here, Shuhei. It's fine. We're talking about, we're talking about the, uh, the, their, uh, the David Cage game.

It's about, I'm sorry, I didn't actually see it. They didn't give you, they didn't give us an interview slot with you this year and I just wanted to express great disappointment in that, in the entire. You can yell at Jenine. Jenine, do you want to come on camera, get yelled at? Don't. She came real quick though on camera. Okay, okay, go, go, go, do your job. We'll do ours. All right, these fans, they just come out of the woodwork, these PS I Love You XOXO fans. So one of the cool things that appears, so you're playing as Connor the Android. First of all, they confirm that there's going to be more than two playable characters. So we, we know we're going to play Connor, but we don't know anything else.",

So we, we know we're going to play Connor, but we don't know anything else. Connor's an Android. He's called in as we saw in the trailer to deal with a hostage situation. Um, what you learn is that quickly is that Connor has this power of perception using his mechanical mind, I guess, or his AI or software, um, to figure out his exact, like exactly his chance of success of his mission. And you can, and so this thing is ticking down from like 47% to 46% based on how quickly you're going through it or because time is of the essence here. But you stop and analyze different things and your success goes up or down depending on like the things you do. So he finds like a guard that Daniel the Android had shot and killed and he figures out how that all happened and his percentage goes up a little bit. And then he finds the little girl's dad that the Android killed and finds the",

And then he finds the little girl's dad that the Android killed and finds the tablet that the dad was looking at. It looks like they're looking to replace Daniel and so that's why Daniel goes crazy. So the chance of success goes way up. But as time goes, success ticks down, down, down, down, down. So when he walks out, he sees an injured police officer that Daniel also shot and he puts a tourniquet on him. But that time taken and the trust loss between him and Daniel brings the percentage back down. So the first time they played, we go through all these choices, um, and ultimately Connor saves the little girl but gets shot and killed and Daniel's killed as well. Okay, so you succeed because the success is, uh, keeping the girl alive. Is keeping her alive. But you lose Connor for the rest of the game. Got it. Um, oh, so it's just like Heavy Rain where if somebody dies, the game keeps moving.",

Um, oh, so it's just like Heavy Rain where if somebody dies, the game keeps moving. It's not every, they said every main character can die. Um, and so they play it again. Uh, Daniel does all these things to to heighten the success way high. Ends up using a gun which he's not supposed to using under the Android Act as they call it. Shoots the guy in the head. The little girl is saved. He's fine. Takes the cartridge out of the gun, gives it to a police officer and moves on. But what's really cool is all the environmental storytelling and the things that you can do. Basically, like you have to move quickly, but you can also base the time spent, uh, like the danger of spending too much time with the benefit of finding things that increase your, your possibility of succeeding. Okay, okay. Um, so sounds complicated, but it's actually super straightforward and it's like really cool, you know, like",

It's really, it's really like kind of a, like a relief actually because we know, we know what Quantic Dream was capable, but we did not see what Quantic Dream was capable of Beyond: Two Souls. So then my questions for you were, I'm sure David Cage was in there talking. Any hints at a release date? And any hints of are we always playing as Androids? Are we going to have some human characters in there? How are we getting the story? No, so no, no talk on if we're only going to play as Androids or not. Okay, the, the thing that he, he wants to stress with the story, which I think is really cool, is, you know, kind of alluding to not necessarily specifically, but like something like Battlestar Galactica where the, the Androids or the are the bad guys, which where the AI is the bad guy. Sure. Uh, in this game, it's very",

Uh, in this game, it's very much that the humans are the bad guys and the Androids are the good guys. And he stresses that, um, most of the Androids, the millions of Androids in the United States, almost all of them are fine. It's just that like a few of them are up and just like starts to cause like a lot of panic. But you can see with someone like Daniel, the AI is that he's not up at all. He's actually just feeling emotions based on being, he's jealous and this is, and this is something he's not programmed for. Sure, sure, sure. It's then becoming real. It's the Johnny 5 principle, I think we all learned about in college. You might say it's them becoming human. Oh, ladies and gentlemen, what do you think of Detroit: Become Human?
