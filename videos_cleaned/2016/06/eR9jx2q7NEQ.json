What's up everybody? I'm Greg Miller and this is the pride of Long Island, Colin. Where you already? Go Jets, Go Jets! Are you already starting it? Yeah, it's got, it's got to, Colin. Yeah, we're back in WW1. Little Battlefield 1. What was your takeaway from the trailer? Uh, looks great, chaotic, um, historically accurate to a degree, I think. Now, run me through the, 'cause I thought we always talked about the front never moves in the original, I mean, like the original World, in the original World War I. Um, what I mean more by this is I'm not going to get into like the geopolitics of World War I, but sure. But what I think is interesting about this is obviously this was the first modern war and um, really is old meets new. I mean, a lot of people would look at even into the American Civil War or something like that as being like old versus new for",

I mean, a lot of people would look at even into the American Civil War or something like that as being like old versus new. For instance, uh, Gatling guns were introduced in this Civil War, um, mowing people down. But this is really a war where there were tanks and airplanes in the air and people riding horses on the ground and doing all sorts of. Tanks were in the air, tanks were on the ground, the planes were in the air, uh, and they were riding horses on the ground, right? Uh, so it was really like a mechanized, really the first major mechanized war. Um, a lot of people were tweeting at me like, did they use Zeppelins? And they have a, yeah, they did. They um, it probably wasn't, it probably was, so it probably wasn't maybe to this, this exciting degree. You know, I mean, Zeppelin came, went, Zeppelin came, went very quickly when they realized not a very practical thing to put, go down in a, in a heartbeat. They're made of tin foil, but they were",

They're made of tin foil, but they were throwing all sorts of things out there, right? I mean, this was the first time you had really all sorts of uh, unique and new weapons that we still see forms of today. Is this what you, when, because when people talk about trench warfare, I didn't think of like up close and personal hand-to-hand combat. This is what trench knives and shovels were, were common weapons, which I think Patrick sold or whoever the hell was on stage just talked about that. Um, yeah, it was a, it was, it was a brutal war. Did a lot of the front never move or some of the front never move? Sure, moved very little. Did very little get resolved in terms of territory? Yes. Um, but there were, it was a brutal war. 10, 11, 13, 14 million people something like that died in World War I. It was a brutal war and here in America we didn't get involved",

It was a brutal war and here in America we didn't get involved until very late, although we are represented. Um, but uh, yeah, so I think it looks really cool. Looks K. Not a game I'm going to probably play because it's, well, it's very multiplayer centric. The last Battlefield game I played was Bad Company 2. So we're talking like you've been out of the game for a while. But I thought this would be the kind of single player that would pull you in, right? All these like, this cutscenes and stuff like this. You imagine that's setting up whatever's happening in there game world, right? My, my hope is that it's something that grabs me, but I also know that the heritage of Battlefield has nothing to do with me. True. You know, um, but I do play Call of Duty every year, so it's, it's, or most years. So I didn't play the last year as Kevin likes to remind me. Uh, but uh, keep them honest, Kev, Kev.",

Uh, but uh, keep them honest, Kev, Kev. You have to keep us honest. Thank you, Kevin. Remember the Christmas party? Oh, it came together at the end, didn't it? It was a nice, we had a nice old dinner. We didn't have a private room though. No, we, and when I went back to Wayfarer recently when my mom was here for a Kinda Funny Live, uh, too, we sat right next to the private room. They were having a goddamn grand old time. That's what they put us there. Having a grand old time. Yeah, we could have been in there. Um, but as far as Battlefield 1, I think it looks fantastic. Yeah, I think World War I, to EA's credit, is something a lot of people don't think about. Um, it wasn't called, believe it or not, World War I when it happened. Um, it was called the Great War and uh, it really is just World War II is really just a continuation of it. It really never ended in a way.",

It really never ended in a way. Sure. Um, the conflict is of World War II is directly derived from what's happening here. Um, we know so much about World War II and it's so steeped in like war and mythology almost. We very, very seldom look back at World War I. So I think this is going to be in, in a weird kind of Colin's way, I think going to be kind of instructional for a lot of people that don't really think about World War I because it is not as glamorous, good versus evil, um, nuclear bombs and surprise attacks and all that kind of stuff. A lot of up happened in World War I. I mean, the way it was started and stuff like that is, you know, an assassination and all those kinds of things. So there's a lot of history to be learned here.

Remember, all week long we are here on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames doing crazy ass as part of our E3 2016 rundown. Don't anywhere. I think so. I mean, we feel like we're just sitting in front of a television set talking to that's crazy right now. But like end of the weeko, we're talking to people. You're talking to this little cone. Yeah, what are you looking forward to at E3, you cone? I want to stop abusing you. Shut up, cone. Until next time, it's been our pleasure to serve you.",
