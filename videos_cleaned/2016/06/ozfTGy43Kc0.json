We had like six real cameras shooting this thing. So many angles. So it's going to be crazy. I want to make sure we do it justice. There's an added layer of There was a lot of copyrighted music and stuff. So we got to make sure that I'm like thinking about YouTube not taking it down and all that stuff. We'll figure out a way. It will be up. I'm going to give myself a month timeline on this. So just think about it that way. There's a whole bunch of fan videos. If you have stuff feel free to upload. Like spread the word.

Um but the documentary is also angled about the community. Like they interviewed a ton of you guys and it's about the experience of being there for the weekend and and you know just kind of meeting a lot of these friends for the first time that you've been friends with for years. So it's pretty cool. Um the show is going to be utterly insane when it goes up when it does. Voting bar.

So uh that was great. And then once that ended people were going crazy and the intro video started. The intro video I worked on until literally 4:30 the night before the show. And I'm so happy I did because I am so proud of that thing. It just was so much work. We had so many friends that gave us videos to put into it and I made sure that I reached out to all you guys to send me pictures of where you're from and it's like we did this thing was like Kinda Funnies Worldwide and it like showed it.

Your video I watched somebody's perspective on it today finally from out front cuz I had seen tons of photos. But when I I didn't realize that when I came out and then when I turned there was like the lightning bolt behind me and it was like perfect. Yeah. No. So that's the thing is like there was the video wall behind everybody. So when you walk out of the catwalk it looks like it's behind him.

Um and then once it got to the like the Undertaker music kicked in it kicked into a remix of the Wonder Woman theme song. Greg rips his clothes off brings out the sign that says uh Batman v Superman was a good movie. Yeah. And people went crazy. It's funny cuz in rehearsals my prediction was that they were going to boo and I was going to get to flick them all off but everybody cheered. I was like ah well it's just so it was so you like that's the thing is they were cheering for you.

Not only like you could say for my entire life but literally since 2008 me and Alfredo talked when I first heard that song. It's a remix of the final countdown. I was like \"One day I'm going to crowd surf to this and it's going to be awesome.\" And then I **** did it and it was awesome.

So I go down and I saw the panic and Kevin where he's like \"Uh-oh he missed the mount. We're fucked.\" And I was like \"No no no no no.\" And I told the people to push forward get up.

So we really put my shoes on. We had Colin doing the 20th Century Fox recorder fail thing and then we had Greg doing the pizza lawyer. We had Nick doing the the Geraldo. Um Kevin was the the giant fish. The the **** is that? The funniest **** thing we've ever done from my perspective. Sorry Kevin. You look great though. You looked great in the water. You did.

I was like \"We got to do it.\" And that's the other thing cuz I I looked at every single forum post about what people wanted and I try to give them as much of that as possible plus way more. Yeah.

I'm a little disgusted by it. Let's cheer. It's kind of how that reaction went. and just come across the stage and then seeing you guys right next to me just feeling like it's **** it was so ridiculous.

For the record people were asking about that cuz PS I Love You. Open today with that as well. Like yeah I emailed Jack Tretton and I was like \"Hey I don't know if you remember me. I've interviewed you a few times and we have this terrible impression and we're doing this conference and we'd like to work with you.\" And he got back within like 3 minutes.

That's that's cool. Thank you very much.\" And he came and he was great and he had fun with it. Dude talk about a surreal moment in our lives when Jack Tretton is sitting at our at the table the kitchen table drinking coffee with us and just like just talking shop. I'm like **** weird.

A new show coming later this year which is essentially a conversation with Colin minus Greg. It's just Colin talked to the camera about video game stuff. And it's going to be written. It's going to be scripted um and highly polished edited stuff. Colin's going to be doing it all himself and it's going to be awesome. I hope so. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah it was fun to go out there. I remember I don't remember it was kind of a blur but going out there and I remember I think the first thing I said was like \"God it's **** hot out here.\" I also said it's San Francisco not Long Island but it'll do something like that.

We have to get through the conventions and stuff first. Yeah. So that's great. Then I came out and announced that Kinda Funny Doodles made by Zack Wenzel which you guys have probably seen on the internet before. He stopped doing them the last couple months for his channel because he's been doing them for our channel to be debuted very soon.

Then then Danny from Ismahawk Danny Shepard came out. We had him on The GameOverGreggy Show before and when he was here we were talking about Dream Projects. We talked about doing a Power Rangers short. He's now making that Power Rangers versus Voltron and we showed the first trailer for it. I'm the Blue Ranger. **** dreams come true. That's awesome.

We're working on a Kinda Funny for a Kinda Funny PlayStation 4 app. Will you ever see it? TBD? Nobody knows. Uh this is like I said on the thing was one of the few things in our world that's out of our hands. We're going to finish it. James has been working on it with the talented development team. It's awesome. It has all the latest videos. is you can log in with your Kinda Funny account so that if you're watching something on KindaFunny.com then you can pick up on that or if you're watching something on your app or vice versa.

So we have uh we have the intro which is almost ready. Uh but we did do the intro uh song the the the song for the for the the first like you know I guess the introd intro for the for every theme. Are we gonna put that? Have we ever talked about Are we gonna actually put that in every episode? Do you think it? Um the theme song is awesome.

Uh he you know to his credit did an awesome job uh pulling together an actual live band writing this in the 80s style. So you guys will see that probably um Dan's hard at work on it right now. So we'll see it probably by the end of this month I would imagine. Um knocking on wood. And then we also because that one wasn't quite finished and we felt I'll be honest I felt a little you know I felt a little bad. I've been feeling a little bad that the animated show's l slacking a little bit. Not really slacking but we're always biting off more than we can chew for that. But it's behind schedule.

Are we breaking these all out? Do you think we'll figure it out? We should break that stuff at some point cuz that's amazing. I'd love to break that out and put it up as content for the animated show cuz I think that I think people would enjoy the **** out of that. Yeah. Um so that that trailer was **** hilarious.

Mike Drucker did a standup set and that was legit and super awesome and I like that it kind of changed the vibe of the thing. We didn't have that last year so it was it was a cool new addition. Then we had Mega Ran come out which was so **** awesome because first off he's so talented. Second up I feel like that really fits the vibe of our audience and it just makes sense and we've had him on the show. There's so much there that just it's just great.
