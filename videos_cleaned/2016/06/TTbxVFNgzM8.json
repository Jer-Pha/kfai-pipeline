What's up, guys? I'm Tim Gettys. This is the illustrious Colin Moriarty. You taught me that word. Good. I'm I'm glad. It's a fantastic word. Um now, so right now we are here on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames covering all the E3 stuff, including ReCore. Here's the very surprising trailer, at least it was surprising to me. Yeah, didn't expect this. Yeah, it's very stylish. Um I mean, I expected to see ReCore at the show, but um and we know the release date had leaked or rumors of the release date had leaked in September. Those those rumors are true, coming Xbox One and PC. Um but uh this is a game by Armature um with the help of Keiji Inafune, who the creator Mega Man and Onimusha and Dead Rising. Um and uh it's an interesting game. I think that my reaction to it once we get into the actual gameplay after this this kind of intro is um it's kind of",

I think that my reaction to it once we get into the actual gameplay after this this kind of intro is um it's kind of budget looking, I guess. Um not quite on the scale uh graphically or aesthetically as the other AAA games that they're showing. Yeah, I don't know that they really treated this as a AAA game. I mean, they revealed it last year, but they didn't really show anything. Um still, I think the game looks really fun. That's really what's most important. I will I a lot of people say like I always say gameplay is king. That's mostly true, almost always. There are exceptions where it's not true. Um but this is obviously being a third-person action shooter platformer. It's kind of interesting little hybrid. So it looks kind of cool. I was saying this earlier during our our live show, but I'm getting a lot of Mega Man X vibes at least from the imagine if you take Mega Man X and put it in in 3D and that's obviously a high",

I don't know if it necessarily lives up to that, but the there's a lot of platforming elements going on here and like the jump and dash and stuff that we're going to see in a bit. And then earlier she was using kind of the the weapons to move the environment to be able to to get across sections. I'm like that. It's pretty cool. And uh as as budgeted as it looks like this is what I'm talking about right here. Like this really looks like Mega Man X to me. Um at least in terms of gameplay if you would have shipped it from 2D to 3D, right? Um I I think it's exciting. I definitely don't think this is a AAA game and I think that's a good thing. I think that we we need more A to B titles. This definitely isn't C. Yeah, I think it's an A title. I I I mean, Armature is a good studio. Um obviously the the the",

I I I mean, Armature is a good studio. Um obviously the the the inclusion of Comcept, um the Japanese company that Keiji Inafune founded when he left Capcom, um is cool. Much like uh the way I felt about other Keiji Inafune associated games like Soul Sacrifice, which was a a really good game Vita. I am curious how involved he really is in this game. Um from other, you know, the studios in Texas, he's in Japan. Um I'm sure he's producing it and maybe helping design it and stuff like that, but this seems to be a game that like is inspired by some of the work he's done, as you said, but um maybe not so literally. Um so I think that the game looks cool. Um I think Xbox's uh lineup is bolstered in a really nice way by some of these A games and some of these smaller games. I think that's smart, not talking so much about the ID@Xbox games, which I think are a lower rung, not",

I think that's smart, not talking so much about the ID@Xbox games, which I think are a lower rung, not necessarily in terms of quality or that I want to play them budget in terms of scale. This is a $60 game. Um I always that's my assumption as opposed to when ID@Xbox game, which would be like $10, $20, maybe $30. So um I'm super excited to play it. I mean, it's really one of those games along with Cuphead and especially Gears of War 4 on Xbox One coming um this year, presumably Cuphead coming this year. Uh that I'm actually like really really stoked. Yeah, know, it's really interesting to me. Uh after last year's trailer, I I did not expect this. I thought I was ReCore was going to be a bit more of like a quiet game, but this look looks kind of loud and action-packed. So I'm excited about that. Let us know what you think about ReCore in the comments below and stay tuned to youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames for all your E3 2016 needs.",
