Oh, hi there everybody, it's me, Greg Miller, and this is a Let's Play on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames of Gravity Rush 2. I'm going to turn around now and play it. Uh, you can still hear me though. You see this? We got this Cat, Syd. You remember them from the first game. Cat, of course, our superhero. We play as Syd, that cop who ended up coming out with us. He always had like, he had the hots for us. We knew it. We didn't like engage. I don't think they've engaged here or anything. Uh, we're moving in Gravity Rush 2 to a new spot here. Uh, Jirga. It's easier to read the word sometimes than it's the same. Um, we're going to get to play through, fight a bunch of stuff, but I was just talking to our good friend Nick, you remember Nick, he was on Podcast Beyond once or twice, uh, about some of the differences in the game and for him a big one was",

Now what I like to point out is look at how like her clothes are like rippling in the wind when you talk about like what this game can do that the Vita couldn't. Uh, more things are happening in town, more little effects like that. And we got airbats coming into the port. Prepare the ropes in a seagull. Uh, but yeah, if you haven't ever seen a Gravity Rush before, I don't know what your problem is. Gravity Rush One was amazing on Vita and then they put on HD Remaster of it. Uh, and I shouldn't say amazing on Vita. I think I gave it a 75 at the time on IGN, if I'm being 100% honest, but it was good. That was when we were",

I think I gave it a 75 at the time on IGN, if I'm being 100% honest, but it was good. That was when we were still in the 100-point scale, so it probably would have gone a little bit higher than that. Uh, this is Cat, she's our superhero. You can see her little pantaloons blown in the wind. You see how great this place looks. But of course, Cat is a superhero, she can fly. It's amazing. This is what the game's all about. I liked it. I like Gravity Rush One 'cause it was a superhero origin story. Uh, there were little things I wanted them to do better. Uh, I don't know if that's really necessarily the fact here. We we'll learn as we go, but I'm definitely glad they got another shot at it 'cause I did enjoy the game. Oh, bad guys, beat the hell out of these guys. But Gravity Rush 2 here coming out in 2016. Yeah, that's right. It's this year sometime. What date? We don't know yet.

They won't tell us, but it's here. It's prettier. It's more Cat, which I enjoy. Now I learned this new one of the new power-ups here. Going to show this is Stasis Field and throwing, which I'm a big fan of so far. Uh, basically using Cat's gravity powers to have projectiles where stuff the bad guys come over here. Those little blue dots on my reticle there indicate how many I have left. But here he's like, \"Hey, yo, octopus face!\" I suck on that at one time. Bam! Beat him up that way. Hooray us! And then we're back to just being Cat. Look at how good this looks. And I it it feels already. I feel it's weird 'cause I didn't I don't think I struggled with the controls on Vita. Now granted that was years ago. Uh, but I do remember feeling like the screen was so tight, it was hard for me to really feel like I knew what was going on. But here we go. Look, just up flying.

Look, just up flying. Now what I do have a problem with is no one in the world seems to be reacting to a flying blonde girl, but whatever. They live in a different time than us. This is how it was back then in prehistoric times. We start this mission, Forbidden Cargo. Of course, the cutscenes are here, or you know, I shouldn't say cutscenes, the graphic cutscenes are here. You get to do this, rotate your camera, look around the comic page, get to see Cat be all cute. Come on now, how cute. She jump over here. She's not impressed with this guy. He's got cargo. There's he go do this. We got to help him get his cargo back. These guys want want to do this. All this happening. Got all this happening. My boy Andrew Kelly over there sitting down.

It's an extra episode, but you can see already it's moving. It's being Gravity Rush. It's cute. It's got the art style we all like from Gravity Rush One. And I feel like it's controlling better, maybe because just how big the screen is, it's more easy to take all the information in, as they say. So now we got to chase this guy. You kidding me? I'm Cat. No problem. And you going to hold down X to go faster. Let's see if we can just dodge around this thing if we're going to slam right into it. Oh my God, we're going to slam right into it. There we go. Let's go investigate what this guy's up to. Stroke your beard, wait to see. And then turns out what he was, his cargo was monsters. Got this new evade.

I don't know if it's new, new to me. I don't remember it from Original Gravity Rush, but got this evade move there. Now I get to dodge around. Dodge these tadpoles. Now that's a problem with tadpoles walking around on all fours. I don't like it and not I'm not a fan of it and I don't have to like it. Now we're going to do gravity kick. Now of course, we already knew how to do this 'cause we played Gravity Rush. So boom, up here and then gravity kick. Look at that, owning fools like nobody's business. Like Cat would do, not Catman do, but Cat would do. You know what I'm saying? Here this, whoa, I'm inside something. All right, so I screwed that one up obviously 'cause I couldn't see that well.

These characters are faster than my gravity kick. Oh no, what am I going to do? And I'm out of gravity juice. Coming down. Bam! Float down. So now here we go. They're so shifty, I can hardly hit them. Time to start introducing the new stuff. So on the pad, flick up, flick up, we go into Lunar Style. Now Lunar Style makes us lighter and it gives us this Wormhole Kick ability, which will get us to these people who are dodging around faster. So do this, great, boom! I'm up in the air. Hold this and then and then just tap it around there. And I'm just combo kicking the crap out of this goddamn thing like, guess what, you freaking weird ass helicopter looking alien black guy, we don't care. There you go. Oh God, he found me.

I'm assuming you've of course looked at every piece of Gravity Rush information that's out there, which I would respect, of course. Uh, but there you go. Something's off about this cargo and I got to destroy it. You want to up pick up these gems, of course. Doesn't matter to me in this demo, but you know we all know that's going to be tied to Trophies eventually, just like the Original Gravity Rush. And so I think when it first debuted, right, they put out the Gravity Rush 2 trailer. The first thing I said is, man, it looks a lot like Original Gravity Rush. Uh, and I thought, I don't know if I'm down with that. From playing it, I can tell you I missed this and I didn't realize I missed it.

And then I was like, well, you know what, this comes out in 2016. I should probably just wait. So that's like, oh, I knew it. We were figuring it out here in the A. Guess what? He he's a bad guy. He's screwed up. We're we're going to eff up his **** right now. So do this, do this. Now we're going to try the Jupiter Style. So flip down on this guy. I got these Gold Bonds on, not the Gold Bond powder, of course, but basically it's going to let me do a kickass Hulk Smash and really screw these guys up. So do this, charge it up and then let it go.

Here's, you know what, overkill. Come up here, get it, flick down, go hardcore, find these guys and take him out with one boom! I'm sparkling. I'm smashing Cat. Everybody, Cat 2016. Yeah, she's Japanese. She can't run for, well, she's also I guess fictional, but she should be the president we elect. Oh, all right, you're a bad guy. We get it. Now I don't know what's going to happen when we have this settlement, ladies and gentlemen. Up until now, I've seen this before. I knew what to expect. Now we're in uncharted Gravity Rush water.
