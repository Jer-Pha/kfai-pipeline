He's going to be playing Headlander while we talk about it. He's get closer, he's there. He's, we're Double Fine, we're going to show off Headlander. Didn't know anything about this game, now really intrigued about this game. Walked in, saw the sign, signage for it, but this reminds me of 1985. I love it. There you go. Was 1985 an inspiration for you? Well, really it was the 1970s, but there was a little 70s Revival in '85 specifically. There you go. So, so there you go. Let's get right into it, Greg Rice. So Lee, what is the thrust of Headlander? That's good. It's good. Well, I'll give you a heads up about. All right, is that where we're, it's just there's endless terrible fun. So, so Headlander is a side-scrolling action adventure science fiction game, but really the heart of the game is about 1970s science fiction and um, you know, we really took a lot of",

So, so Headlander is a side-scrolling action adventure science fiction game, but really the heart of the game is about 1970s science fiction and um, you know, we really took a lot of inspiration for movies like Barbarella and Logan's Run and Silent Running and those sort of movies. And you know, so the the game is really about the last living human organic being in the Galaxy, but you're just a head. Oh, great. Yeah, you're just a head. But you wake up in this world that's all automation. So all of humanity has left their organic bodies and instead inhabit robotic imposters. And the whole world is governed by an evil computer intelligence, just like everything in the 1970s. Computers are evil, like in the 70s. New computers and robots are evil. I think we kind of forgot that. We have, yes, we've given them too much power for sure. And um, so we're going to play through a segment that's not the start of the game, but a little ways into the game. And um, in this segment, you've got back past sort",

And um, in this segment, you've got back past sort of early tutorials and learn your basic controls and you've escaped a ship and crash landed into a giant space station called the Pleasure Port. And in the Pleasure Port, say this, my, I was going to say this is for the two guys who h-ling sex stuff. This that's that's makes 70s science fiction so great is it just really couldn't escape the era it was made in. You know, that's good. And so we really um, there's just something really charming about about that like naive take on technology, but also this really interesting like utopian glaze on an act. Don't take a, yeah, so this is you flying your head around, which is since you're just a head, you actually have a special helmet and the helmet uh lets you uh around the world and his case he sort of collecting um some energy here which drives our upgrade",

And uh you haven't really met Earl yet, so you don't really know what's going on. Character doesn't have any lungs, so he can't ask questions. So does is your character understanding of the fact that he's just a head? Like did he just wake up and be like, where's my body at? Or know? Yeah, so again, because the character can't pose specific questions there, it's left a little bit of a mystery in the player's mind exactly what the character does or doesn't know. But in the very start of the game, you see the sort of shock on the character's face as they wake up mounted into a computer terminal and Earl, the guy who's talking to your helmet, hacks uh a robot arm and pulls you off the",

Um, so you can get, you can use your head to kind of get into all these areas that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get into. Um, and now you're meeting the citizens for the first time and citizens are tripping out to one of our pleasure rooms. This is called the Venus Apparatus. And so they're really like kind of zoned out admiring the holograph here, but you can vacuum their heads off and take control of their body. That's something you can do to anyone in the game. And so, you know, the citizens aren't really armed and they put too much a fight, but their bodies don't do much and they can access basic rooms, be able to fix, talk. They can and do certain things like that. But um, when you meet the Shepherds, which are kind of the enemies of the game, uh they have",

How many times did you guys watch Logan's Run before you made this game? Uh, quite a few. I have, I have quite an extensive library of 70s science fiction that we all watch, like we watch one a week. This is a Fondlarium. And uh, if you uh, you can dance too throughout the game. A lot of unique dancing in the game. He put it down. Yeah, so the uh, the interesting thing is because you're constantly switching bodies, each body, each body can do things a little differently, move slightly differently. In this case, just have different dances. We talk to other individuals, they'll respond to you differently based on the body you have. So you can kind of like weave a little bit more like what's going on in the backstory. If I'm not mistaken, we're in",

If I'm not mistaken, we're in the bo tuber. We're in the tuy. Yeah, I'm familiar with this specific room in an establishment. You're a big fan of the bo. Well, I've been to many. So this is where you like, this is supposed to be a pleasure thing, right? But these citizens are just zoned out. They're just like, just sitting there staring at these psychedelic patterns. Or in the Fondlarium, they're in robot bodies that actually can't feel, but they're rubbing themselves on shag carpet. And so what you learn, nice little, little friction. Um, science, science friction. Science friction. I like. So much for joining us, ladies and gentlemen. All right, so wait, he's taking the body of so Mappy is kind of like a walking um, directory sign. And so he's super annoying, uh voiced by Richard Horvitz from Psychonauts. Oh, cool.

Um, but if you land into him, you can extract his data and your mini-scan, your mini map system gets updated rooms and like maybe some power-ups and secrets and side missions that you haven't yet encountered. I'm assuming you have that the whole time, not just when you leave Mappy. That's right. Yeah, yeah. So kind of you kind of download the data. What winds up happening over the course of the game is as you experience things or or dock with certain terminals or flex certain types of energy, your synaptic connections grow stronger with the helmet. And so the player is able to um, do more things with the helmet. So now when we were set setting up camera, every kept talking about Metroidvania. It's a Metroidvania game. Nick is a huge Metroidvania fan. Like, is that, I mean, is the map part of that? I pulling it in, see sections you missed before?",

I pulling it in, see sections you missed before, but not knowing how to open that door. Uh-huh. Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, one of the things that we have going on here um, that that is similar to that that style of game is that we have um, so far we've only seen citizens, but each body has a security clearance and it starts at grade that. And you see the little little thing in the lower right there that will go up or down based on when you're in a body. It's security. So you start out red, then it goes orange, yellow, green, blue, violet. And those open doors of the same color throughout there. Um, when you are talking about like a Shepherd, that also indicates the color of their laser and that for how many times it bounces. So red laser bounces once, orange bounces twice, yellow three, green four. So the combat intensifies as you can bounce lasers around the",

So the combat intensifies as you can bounce lasers around the environment. And you also use that laser ability to solve puzzles because is you have things like doors that will open for bodies or lasers, but won't open just for your head. But bodies can't move vertically, but your head can go through two ways. So you're kind of constantly switching between head mode and body mode that each have different um advantages. And um that's uh so that ties a bit into the Metroid in terms of like that door progression. And then we also have um uh you show them the upgrade system. Do your job. I was waiting for you. So um, you know, you will find things like there's a continuous laser beam and if you to fly your head and that it destroy you. So you're seeing this sort of soft gating stuff here that you can't get by. Um, your helmet will get abilities that allow you to kind of get",

Um, your helmet will get abilities that allow you to kind of get by those things. Um, and you have certain abilities that are given to you. So in the beginning of the game, you got the ability to vacuum off heads, which you've shown me, but we're going to get another one here soon. So yeah, so some of these are um, there's a lot of head sucking in the game. Good. Um, yep. And uh uh you uh like it's too easy. Yeah, that's the game is kind of built for it. So here's kind of like the upgrade tree. And you see that we have this one of the branches has been unlocked, which is the, which is this sort of pink branch here, which we a Vacuum Drive. And there are these other upgrades that you can start to access as you buy their things in the branch. And so he bought melee power, which then opens up some additional pluses that modify it.

And um, he could buy the next thing in the chain. So we have these sort of branch level upgrades that are given to you for fundamental abilities. But then the player has a lot of ability to customize kind of the stuff they're interested. So thing about the game we found when play testing is that some people really wanted to hold on to bodies. They really didn't want to let a body go. They're just used to keeping their body alive. But really you only die when your head dies. Bodies are almost just tools. So if you're the type of player who likes bodies, you can increase its melee power, get damage resistance, you know, beef it up in other ways. But if you like to fly around the helmet, you can get shielding for your helmet. You increase your Boost. You can actually get the ability to like make bombs from things you've sucked in your Vacuum Drive. So um, you",

I like how the like every room the camera is like slightly different. Sometimes it will be like just a 2D thing. It's more 2.5D coming at you. Whatever. It's like it's Metroid, very Shadow Complex in a lot of ways too. But I like also that the the head mode is is fast. You know, usually you don't get to like speed around into later in a Metroidvania-style game. But I like that the two different um modes are very different gameplay. You know, one's a bit more bullet hell-y. Yeah, and it very much gets that way in the later game, especially because you can imagine when you're finding enemies that have say purple lasers, they're bouncing six times off the environment every time they fire and they're using quad lasers or eight fractal lasers.

Um, and the interesting thing about like, so we have a a cover system as well again for um, you know, that let you kind of dodge some of these lasers here. You can time it and do these sort of spray on shots or you can uh bounce him around the environment. You're going to see like take the guy there. And if you hold down, you get precise aim, which gives you kind of a tracer laser. So you it'll show how it's bouncing and that'll yeah. And so once that gets, you know, you can imagine as it bounces more and more times, it gets pretty crazy. And so he's in a red body, so it's got one bounce and it's got a certain amount of damage body, certain on durability based on that that security.

Um, uh, but but uh, it's hard to vacuum the head off. I failed my PR, sorry. I like that it feels very so there should be something and the lock read more comics. Comics are good. Uh, so uh, the other interesting thing is that um, just in terms of bodies and heads is that uh, if you know the head is a little more vulnerable than the body because you can see here he's getting shot and the head will recharge its health over time, but bodies don't. So uh, it creates interesting dynamic for the player when they're like, I really want that body, but I can't just spray shot it because I'm going to damage it and I need to land on it.

Uh, there are a couple ways to do it. There are occasional healing stations you can find uh in the environment, but there's also upgrade path that let you use your helmet energy to regenerate the bodies as they take damage. This yes, good. So he's uh got little dogs. You can suck the head off a dog of a life and you be a dog. I've been waiting to suck off a dog a long time. This is the game for you. Got so what what can the dog do? Is that just more of a cutie thing or does it have skills? Uh, it's it's kind of a combination of things.

Lots of little holes in this game as well. And some of them you can fit into. Um, so for this, for example, this one, you can put the dog in the little hole. And inside here, for example, is uh something if he goes into that, that would take him out. So this is another gating thing. But what's on the other side of that is is our pickup system, which is sort of separate from the upgrade. Um, and we'll we'll show you that here in a minute. But but you can there various. So you can see that body is pretty damaged there, right? Got a lot of health. So you got to might want to find a better one. And each of the bodies has some proceduralism in terms of the",

And they're kind of randomly populated. So um, there's a little bit of just sort of discovering to see what what laser they might have and which one's slightly cooler. Um, but the pickup system increases things like your helmet Health, uh your helmet overall speed. Uh this the speed you're flying at is actually the slowest speed you'll ever fly in the game. It gets ridiculously fast. So yeah, he landed a little. Can you move as the snowman or you you kind that one is just an observation post. It was Frosty the Observer.

You can go here and activate fully healthy. And like that, he could try that that laser out. He's got a single now, but like that other one in there might looks like he might have something else.
