The only thing better is the E3 hype. And then there's that post-E3 discussion. My God, is E3 really the best? The best? Is it the best? It is the best. It's fun. It's exciting.

Ubisoft, Ubisoft, however the hell you want to say Ubisoft. Monday, 1:00 p.m. Ubiquitous. I and I really hope that at that conference in the middle of it, you see, \"Here comes the money!\" And Vince McMahon comes out and it turns out they bought him on stage at that moment. It's like all WWF. Um, then Sony, 6:00 p.m., coming in to wrap up the day. Give me a pound for ignoring that dumb PC conference. Oh, yeah, there's a PC. Hey, but who wants to look at keyboards that light up in different colors? Matters. Um, then Tuesday, Nintendo coming through without even a Direct. They're just doing Zelda all day.

So all day Sunday and all day Monday, around those conferences, we we will do and you will get a pre and post show of every conference. So pre, leading into into it, you get at least a half hour, 30 minutes before every conference for sure. We're live on Twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames, talking about it, letting you know what we think's going to happen, even in addition, last minute stuff after this episode happens.

Should have been broken into two. I think they come out and they're like, \"Guess what? Redesigned Xbox One, smaller, cheaper. It's here. We've listened to your complaints and your concerns.\" That's where it is. Here's this nice little price point for it. However, we are working. We are future proofing.

And I actually think the marketplace is going to be a little skittish, um, if you don't start talking about it now. Yeah, 100%. People, if if you come out and you say there's a smaller Xbox and you don't mention the fact that this thing that's all but rumored and all but true and Phil Spencer been hinting at forever, then you're exactly where we are right right now with PlayStation 4, correct?

It seems like according to the rumors, before their console's ready. I still think it was we get into the PlayStation predictions later that that Neo is imminent. So, um, they have they have to say something because there's probably more than a year between the conference and when Scorpio's actually going to hit market. And so they're going to have to sell a lot of they hope to sell millions and millions of Xbox Ones in that time. If if you give the the market a reason to buy a cheaper and slimmer Xbox One, I think that's a smart move in the meantime, in the interim. And those can obviously be on sale at the same time as well.

Um, and I think that they'll start liquidating those other Xbox Ones. Um, if they haven't really stopped production already. I don't know, you know, I don't know anything about that kind of stuff. So in terms of Microsoft's thing, it's just that they need to push more Xbox Ones. That Xbox One is bloated and ugly and huge and probably way too expensive to make.

Possibly. I don't know. I mean, I I'm not so sure HoloLens is ever going to make it the market. But um, it's a cool piece of hardware. They could talk about it. They did last year with Minecraft.

And my thing is, they're either going to do the available right now for Crackdown beta or for Halo Wars demo. But I I think both of them will be announced. One of them will be a right now thing and one of them will be a down the road. So the Halo Wars demo, I think is more down the road. How far out is Halo?

I don't think they, but somewhere around there. I don't know. Yeah, I do not know. Um, Sea of Thieves, do you think that they'll have a nice demo for it during the the conference? Yeah, I think so. I I I think you have to show Sea of Thieves because I I feel like there's people that are interested in it. It's a different kind of game for Rare, and I wonder, um, I wonder if there's really actual actually a lot of uh enthusiasm around it or not.

ReCore is the the next one on the list. You think we get an actual gameplay demo of that or just I think we got a gameplay demo on a release date.

From what I from what I heard, they went back to the the drawing board a bit and added because like the big critique was that there wasn't enough um, just boss fights. Yeah, it was just that wasn't platforming and stuff. And from what it sounds like, they went back and adding platforming stuff, which is super awesome. I'm excited about that. Um, now getting into the more kind of completely unconfirmed stuff, very speculative. Battletoads. No, I don't think so. I I I think that there's this is the Crash Bandicoot of Microsoft.

And I don't I think it's a red herring. I I I don't know. I'd be surprised if it is. It's a $0 game being made by some studio never heard of.

It's just going to keep kind of going, but I feel like it needs that that fire of, yeah, it this year is Gears, but Halo is coming still. Um, I think it'd be good for them to keep that in the the conversation and stuff, and I I think a teaser would be a a strong call for them. I disagree just because I think that we're starting to I mean, we're already talking about games that are announced too soon, games that have been in the limelight too long that like miss their arc.

I think they have to take some critical feedback, but more importantly, like I don't I I said it before the game came out like I don't believe for a second that that game sold nearly as well as the other Halo games. And I think that they have to go back to the drawing board and figure out why that is and and um flesh that out and figure that out and give them time to um, you know, 343 to make the game they want to make. So I think it would be a huge mistake to announce a game two to three years before it's going to launch, um, even in a teaser. And I like the Halo 5 teaser.

So um, um, let Gears have the limelight. Gears looks shit great. And you know, just let them. And they have these other games that they have to get out like Scalebound and shit. It's like you don't want to you don't want to announce too many things, you know? So Scalebound, do you think that they'll actually give a release date? No, I I think that when we saw Scalebound last year, it was running like garbage. Um, which I remember I was like, wow, like I can't believe they're even showing this.
