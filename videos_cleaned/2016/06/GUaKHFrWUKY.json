            "text": "Nick, what's your topic? Complete polar opposite from the one we just talked about. Uh, I was on the flight back from E3 and the very classic film Kindergarten Cop. Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Governor, very for IDE, uh, great ideas, uh, some bad ideas too, uh, not as bad as people think. I'll show we can dive into that on a later one. I'd love to actually hear your opinion on him. Um, my question is, now they've made a sequel, the Kindergarten Cop did, direct-to-DVD, direct-to-DVD, Dolph Lundgren, right? Where where he goes and looks for some sort of flashlight. Bill Bellamy was in that. Yeah, did you see this? No, I saw the trailer. Oh man, we got to watch this. It came last month. Um, so my question is, out of all the films they're remaking, why don't they remake Kindergarten Cop? Why can't they give it an actual wide theatrical release? Cast someone amazing in it. Stop remaking, make new movies. I mean, there's no way they could have captured that magic. That movie has something so special to it. That's my question to you, if should",

Like I remember being a wee little lad watching this movie on the the late night like TNT and all that shit and I was just blown away. That movie introduced me to ferrets. Yeah, I love ferrets, illegal in California. And just just overall, yeah. Oh, trust me, every kid that grew up in the '90s knows that because they were I didn't I didn't know my my grand my grand my dad's dad had a ferret. But that's maybe you know, say your dad's dad was a ferret. He was also a ferret grandpa. The story of that movie though, I mean, it was it just captured you, you know, and just that end part.

The reason it wouldn't work anymore is because there's no star in our world of social media and everything else that can make that move and make that pivot and have it be as funny as that was. Because remember, Arnold Schwarzenegger was still coming off of being The Terminator and being all these The Barbarian. I if I read correctly on IMDb, he literally left the shoot to go film a teaser for T2, right? So this puts it in context as like when this was happening, he was like the ultimate badass. And so there was no look behind the curtain that he wasn't always like that. And so for him to come out like, because they open that movie and I remember that trailer opening very much like it's his normal, yeah, he's going to kill all these people and be awesome.

Who would do? You don't have some like The Rock's awesome. Everybody knows The Rock's awesome. He's in, you know, Vin Diesel done a bunch of different, right? And none of those had the explosion though. Vin Diesel did The Pacifier and none of them, right? None of them had that kind of crossover potent. Hulk Hogan did a shit. Yeah, yeah, Mr. Nanny, whatever. Hulk did the nanny movie and then he he did the he was a space movie too. Yeah, that was where it's like that just doesn't even then it was like Hulk Hogan's persona was already so lovable and great that those movies didn't have those explosive appeal when Arnold Schwarzenegger comes out of nowhere and suddenly it's fucking awesome and everybody's like, oh my God, he's funny.",

Yeah, I thought he could barely speak, but it turns out he can barely speak and he's funny. I'm actually convinced, and I can't really back this, actually, I could back this up. I'm convinced he got worse as an actor as as it goes. Like if you watch his stuff now and then you go back and watch Kindergarten Cop where he could he actually had decent scenes in that film. Like I haven't seen it as as an adult ever. So I'm watching this. I'm like, these are actually heartfelt scenes where he's emoting and he's he he has an emotional range in this. And then you go back later and watch like End of Days or whatever, like the the one he did he just did where he was like a a sheriff, a town sheriff, a giant Austrian town sheriff in Middle America and he's he's just one note the entire.

Like, all right, be Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know what I mean? Don't you don't need range for that or whatever. But it's sad because I feel like he he actually started progressing as he was trying and then realized that he doesn't have to actually try. Well, I think it's just I think yeah, his career, I mean, he just kept getting those roles. It's just be Schwarzenegger. That's I used to worry about. Yeah, I'm just fascinated. I'm fascinated with you guys' perspective on this because I, you know, you all know that I I love terrible films. And in and in fact, Cop's Terri, my that's my question.

So I think it's like, you know, Casablanca, no, but is it an enjoyable fun movie? I use would I use the term very high esteem for Kindergarten Cop? Probably not, probably not. But it's good. I haven't seen it in way too long, but I'm sure I would enjoy it. I'm sure that I would actually want to watch it comes on TV and I'm like, all right, this is my afternoon.

But like we're like we always knew they were going to come back in the back. Oh man, that's all only life. So Nick, this this might warm your heart a little bit. Sure.

But uh, it it makes me happy that they see it in high regard. Yeah, you know, the school system that's what their teach kids now. It's just it's it's one of those rare instances, well, from the '80s where the absurdity worked, right? Where it all came together. And that because that could have been a huge disaster similar to Jingle All The Way, right? Where you were like, what is happening? This Nick, horrible film. Excuse you, Jingle All The Way, fucking Turbo T. He's got to get Turbo Man or whatever the fuck doll was. Jingle your face. And that's the same thing though. What it suffered from is they tried to do it again of like, all right, we'll put him Junior also, right? And Junior was one of those Jun Junior, yeah, it wasn't it was they were it wasn't good.

Junior is later where where he became pregnant. Yeah, he was the first man to become pregnant. Twins was the one that actually Twins had some heart to it because they had Danny DeVito and Danny DeVito played the the other side of the G. Twins was two years before Kindergarten Cop. I like to look at them as kind of a trilogy. You know, you got your Twins, you got your Kindergarten Cop, and you got your Junior. It tells a nice little little story that Jingle All The Way is when they tried to take it too far. Jingle All The Way was probably the end of his career as we knew it.

I just said Twins. We're talking about Twins. I thought you said Junior. I'm sorry. Maybe Twins. I liked Twins was good. I'm just trying to defend Twins. I Danny DeVito, it's where they were born and he and Arnold Schwarzenegger got all the good genes and Danny DeVito got the leftovers. And so I mean, it's kind of a genius concept.

There's a sequel called Triplets. If they were remake Kindergarten Cop starring the fucking goddamn it, I would have to see that film. I know you would. Or starring Vin Diesel. Triplets is in development according to this. Yes, yes, yes. Uh, it's Danny DeVito, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Eddie Murphy. Oh my God, the Triplets. I don't know a lot about science, Kevin, but can we get them in every report?

He ain't Eddie. He's not Eddie anymore. That's that's a topic for another day because I I I used to love Eddie Murphy and then watching sort of his not decline, but sort of transition over to family films has been kind of sad for me. You're talking about a guy who had probably one of the best biting senses of humor from the '80s and '90s ever. And then he just couple things happened to him and he just couldn't do it anymore. Unfortunate. It reminds me of it reminds me of um, like anywh if he's declin or like which seemed to be partially like what he wanted uh, in a way.

Oh yeah, that's be funny as hell. Different, probably a bad funny. No way they're doing a hard R. Are they set to succeed right now? Going to be okay. So maybe maybe it'll be on the level of 21 Jump Street. I think it will. That's a really good call. They're going to hit that great.
