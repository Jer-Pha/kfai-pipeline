What's up everybody, welcome back to E3 2016 on the GameSpot Co-Op Stage brought to you by Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I'm one of your hosts, Kinda Funny Greg Miller, alongside Kinda Funny's Colin Moriarty. Hello Greg. Kinda Funny's Tim Gettys. Let's him host GameSpot's Chris Watters. Yeah, hello, how are you? I'm delighted. Now I've assembled this panel of experts to decide once and for all the best conference of E3. No, no, just shout it out and become a segment early. Got it. We'll go through Nintendo Treehouse. I assume we're all on the page. PlayStation, yes. Yeah, I think, I think it's pretty easy. Yeah, that said, this is what I said yesterday, yeah. Microsoft can't catch a break. Yeah, right. The example I use, Xbox One selling very well, PS4 is selling meteorically, so no one cares that Xbox One is selling very well.",

Xbox One has a great conference, then Sony goes last, has a better conference. Now no one talked about how Xbox had a great, right? You won't be very clear. Both of our party first, both first party is very strong, but Sony clearly the winner. Five exclusives, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, right in the beginning. Very little talking, very little fanfare, just showing the games. When we were talking about why PlayStation's saying is actually at the library, it's all these different things. But for part of it, Chris, is the fact that it was the exact opposite of all the conferences we hated. It was direct. They hit you with the trailers, boom, boom, boom, like you're saying. And then, I mean, let's not discount the orchestra playing, the presentation of the whole thing, from the set to the orchestra, all of that stuff was it.",

Here's a game, here's something that's gonna happen, and they're gonna all them you everything. They accompanied what they were showing us, right? Not what they were telling us. I think that's really important. And I think you were the one who pointed out today while we were talking, or maybe it was Danny, but I'll give you credit for your American, is the fact that the curtains only opened for Hideo Kojima. Oh my God. I get curtains were closed, walked out in front of him a lot, but they only opened to reveal Hideo Kojima. That, yeah, that and everything drew your attention up. I mean, that was like, that was a regal entrance. Yeah, I mean, if this isn't minting this guy as game royalty, I don't know what is. Like, yeah, he's already there and they see them continue.",

I mean, the dude is far from flawless, but like, to have that kind of focus on a creator like that, like a rock star, yeah, awesome. No, I think it's cool. I think it's cool that it gives, it gives people for him to be in that position, it allows other people to one day be in that position. You know, you got to create it and you got to like, be hyped about stuff and be excited on stuff, or else no one else will be. And putting the spotlight on the game creator as well, like, yeah, you know, I think Shawn did a great job of emceeing the event. Yeah, but having creators out there and spotlighting them and thriving, I think that's great. Yeah, it flies in the face of what you were saying about some of our shows about how you don't want games getting announcements are not within an 18-month.",

Yeah, but I do, I do, I think we might lose sight of the fact that, you know, Kojima came out and said, 'I'm back,' and it really was its first real public expense of here in since then, right? The Game Awards didn't happen for him. And based on that, you can imagine that he a sextant it happened for him because then a week, you know, at the end of the PSX week, they have the video that's kind of awkward of, and then, and they also ended with Paragon and sub a PSX adapt as far as hell. The, I mean, I have two things to say. Hey, like, I think Chris's point, I think it's right. Like, I like the showcase, the people that create games. We just had David Cage on before, another game creator that's well known, that's the head of his studio. And this goes way back to the heritage of why people.",

And this goes way back to the heritage of why people left Atari to found Activision, the entire idea of like, founding a company to showcase games. This was also EA's charge in the 80s to put people, David Crane, his face on a box. David Crane's A Boy and His Blob, you know what I mean? So this goes way back to the heritage of, of that. I think it's important that we do that because these people are artists and their creators. But I don't think they would have materially benefited or lost anything by not having Kojima at that conference. They didn't need him there, sure. And they still would have won without him there. Didn't win because he was there. And that game, I mean, anyone who thinks that game's coming before 2019 at the earliest is fooling themselves. And there's a lot of delusion around that, I think, on the internet right now. But I give him the time he needs.",

Yeah, but you didn't, you know, I, I do believe like we said before it, but then Sony really did it last year, the six to 18 months, although anything after 18 months, I don't want to see it. I care if it exists, I don't want to know about it. And so it's cool to see Kojima's, you know, game in the name. And then you got Norman Reedus back and all this guy's, that's awesome. Kojima is a hero. We don't need it. You know, you, you let off with these five great exclusives and let's focus on those things. They're still riding, it was still riding that excitement train of him. He's out now, he's free. And here is, I like it.

Is it gonna be at E3? It's gonna be at TGS?' Like, I like those questions. Without that, we always know what's gonna be there unless it's a total surprise. There's no fun in that. I mean, I, I like that the surprise angle. I'm because a lot of people are being like, 'Well, you know, Colin being hypocritical because you're praising Sony for announcing all these games, are showing these games in there, we don't know the release dates.' I'm like, 'Dollars to donuts, I bet you those are all 2017 games that they showed.' You know, God of War, Detroit: Become Human, that's probably both 2017 games. I think Detroit could slip.

One of them could slip, but I think, but I think in terms of managing the portfolio, my interesting tells me that they don't want to put dates on anything because of what happens, sure, when you do that. And it happened with Uncharted, and it happened with, all right, I mean, Horizon. It happens with almost everything they announced. The Last Guardian, wait, happy seeing a date on that was a really huge deal. But I think the intent behind what they're doing is in their internal portfolio, they'll see how everything shakes out with our, like, they're probably aiming for 2017 for those three games.

So I think they manage things really well. I will say though that there was, I've been talking to people about this, and the more I think about the Sony conference, the more I think it's true that Neo's slot was probably at the end. Yeah, and they showing Days Gone there was just weird when he was kind of all over and weird as an end cap to the entire conference. Interesting. Yes, because they could have shown a trailer and in gameplay back-to-back, which I've done before. Yeah, and the rest of the game, no. And they, and so they put that at the end, which I think was interesting. And Andrew House giving our interviewed of Financial Times two days before E3 is just a random interview saying like, 'Neo is real,' or, 'Our new console's really will not be at E3,' is super weird.

And I think that now that they know that the console will show underpowered, you have to assume that they're kind of scared now. Whether or not they've already got better there through the looking glass that's over and they have to release it or not, I still say they take that thing back inside and figure out what they gonna do with it because the Scorpio rumored specs are way more powerful than the PS4 Pro's rumored specs. And it's interesting to look at the Sony press conference and what we liked about it, you know, that it was game, game, game, game relentlessly.

I think they like, like this conspicuous lack of many indie games on the PlayStation stage was a big change this year for them. So Microsoft press conference, I think, still really strong. I think amazing. I think Microsoft's first conference was one of the best ones they've ever done. And I think that I am shocked that Sony beat them. I, I really am. I am. I didn't seem like when we finished the Microsoft one, it was like, 'Wow, party really,' because they did nail it. And that's what Colin's saying is like, 'This year's has been great.'

If you watched it, it wasn't that good along. You know, it had an hour of a whole hour. It kind of would have been great. But overall, when you look at the conferences from a pure announcement standpoint, everything, they were all great except for yet. So, but Microsoft and Sony, I think, were really, they nailed the presentation and the announcements. And I think that's the most important thing. I didn't, you can get better than Microsoft in terms of pacing, and then Sony did. And you're making a strong case here, Tim, for Microsoft's strength.

Sony with their laser focus on games was high impact. Yeah, and you know, the trailers, you're gonna want to rewatch them and you want, get want to line up the release dates. But once you've done that, you know, aside from PSVR, there's not a whole lot to talk about. Microsoft has a lot more to sort of, all right, now I'm like actually thinking about it, do I need that upgrade or am I gonna wait or what does this mean for my even virus? Yeah, well, our system when there's a better system coming next year.

And it really makes you think like, I wonder in a couple years, will Microsoft be playing catch-up and do something similar to then talk about the more community-focused off and the stuff that's not fun? You know, the stuff that's not like headline worthy, like quick, quickie, but it's more like meaningful to the players, right? Because this was a very different conference from Sony. They don't do stuff like this. Talk about something that, sorry to interrupt, Tim. Don't worry. Yeah, all right, let's talk about saying there's a through line for a few concerts, our conferences.

You know, how do you guys compare each sort of VR showing within the conferences? So my thing is with Ubisoft, I'm impressed that a company finally showed VR being played on a stage and it's worked. It didn't have any tech fails. You didn't have anything. It didn't look fun or toll. But, you know, the guy, Eagle Flight, look better. Go. It's fun.

Oh boy. Yeah, purely steering what there's and are they, it's going on, just sit. Yeah, but I will give it to them that at least it worked because we've seen at PSX, we've seen all E3 shows, the VR just doesn't work on stage. So at least they have that. But Sony's conference, that's how you sell units. Oh my God, PSVR. I guarantee you because the last night they're gonna sell way more than they were good. There was suddenly stuff you do wanted to play. It wasn't a demo, it was a weird experience. It was, remember the Kitchen demo, that's Resident Evil 7, Star Wars, Batman. It's just Final Fantasy.

And you can sit back and watch how like what the feelings kind of tell you about how to handle that because, you know, dollars to donuts, sure as they're gonna have to deal with this problem as well with three different platforms.

And I want to see if that's true as well. Well, I mean, it's just the, you know, the tendencies with PlayStation Neo and now Project Scorpio. That Scorpio kept a lid on it long enough to give you the polished presentation and have a bunch of developers be like, 'We want to give you better experiences. We want to give you better games. This allows it. This allows it.' Where Sony leaked it all out, it was just like, 'It's barely, but it's just for VR.' I never got all mad about it.

It seems powerful enough that it could be a new machine, like an entirely. And they're talking about how it's backwards compatible and all those kinds of things. That is the problem with Sony. And that's why everyone's like, 'Well, Colin, why are you so mad at Sony for PS4.5 and you think Scorpio is a good idea?' I'm like, 'Because Scorpio seems like it's a new console and they're just, I'm saying it yet.'

So like, I feel like, I feel like with Scorpio, they might be eyeing like, like Aaron Greenberg told us, a generation-less kind of approach to gaming. And Sony is having, is taking a more iterative approach without being modular with a machine that's not that much powerful. And they're selling it's being like, 'Well, don't worry about it, it's not that much more powerful.' And that's not going to sell the consoles. That's why I think Sony is up.

I think that's an even bigger problem is that Xbox has this thing on a more powerful Xbox coming out in two months. Yeah, it's super interesting. To Microsoft's credit, date, and I said it, you know, that's why I was surprised that Sony beat them. They needed to go on the offensive and they took a shotgun, just shot it right in Sony's face. Now, I don't think that they realized that it was gonna, maybe some of those bolts might be repelled back at them. Some of that grape, that grape shot might be repelled back at them. And it was, but they needed to do that.

And Aaron Greenberg, it's way smaller than they're even letting on. And I think it'll be, that looks about the same size as the PS4, maybe even a little smaller in some way. So I think it's kind of a really nice machine. Yeah, I just still feel like what I brought up on the one of our shows, the fact that with PlayStation 4 Neo, I'm like, 'Oh, sure, take my money.'
