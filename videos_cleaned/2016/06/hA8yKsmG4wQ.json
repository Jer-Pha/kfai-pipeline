Yes, today's question comes from 19-year-old Jenna. Jenna says, \"Hey guys, love the show. So here's the deal. I know my boyfriend loves naked pictures of me and I love sending them. Is this okay? Is there anything to worry about? And more importantly, how do I improve them?\" Jenna, you've come to the right place. Welcome to Meg's House of Nudes. Oh my God, it's my favorite house. First of all, I like being in this house. Yeah, when you're 19, oh, take as many nude photos as possible because A, you're young enough to not realize the repercussions if they get out and B, you look great, you look your best. So I mean, past that about 16 years ago.",

So I mean, past that about 16 years ago. Before we get into the fun, the fun part of this, let's talk about the repercussions cause I feel like that is important to address. You need to realize. My rule, my rule of thumb in general is never take a picture that you wouldn't be okay with getting out there because it could and it probably will. You have to accept that if you take a photo. My my rule of thumb is similar: do I look my best? Like if my bare ass has to be shown to the world, am I going to be proud of this bare ass? And the answer is usually yes. And then I send a photo. That's good. So that's really good because there there is this this culture now where you know everyone having a phone in their pockets and you images are just being texted left and right willy-nilly. Something's going to get out. Just be okay and just know that. And um,",

Think about the um, career choices that it might limit. You know, you just need you need to know that, know those things. Having said that, let's talk about the fun stuff. How to make them better. Oh man, angles. Yeah, see, I don't lighting. I could I'm the opposite of this. I would never do this simply because I hate my body and if I ever I don't even see myself naked in the shower. I put a blindfold on and I feel around like a blind man in a pool. Um, yeah, I don't I don't know how people would do this. Like this is this is this is a generational, well, to be fair, it's sort of a generational thing, but also like men have it a lot harder than women. I think the key",

Like this is this is this is a generational, well, to be fair, it's sort of a generational thing, but also like men have it a lot harder than women. I think the key to the male naked picture is comedy. Like, well, I mean, the male body is it a towel on my dick? I'm not touching it. Exactly. Right? Like it's that type. It's that stuff where it goes like, all right, so so the women, I mean, they got a little more options in terms looking good. I mean, I guess I guess this is coming from a guy that you know isn't like super jacked. If I was jacked, then it's then it's the whole yeah, I told story. But I don't know when to jacked people. Exactly. So what you want to do is make them laugh. You want to tantalize. You want to send a picture that's like, hey, here's where I'm at right now. Am I naked? Yeah, I am. Am I doing this cheeky? I mean, it's not like like full comedy. You're not going like full wheelbarrow, but like don't dress it up. You know what I mean? You don't want to be putting like",

You don't want to be putting like little outfits on the guy. Do women in in general do they actually respond positively to that to the dick pic? Here's the thing, the dick pic is not like a, \"Ooh, I want to see your dick. It's so hot.\" It's more of an, \"I need an insurance that this is a two-way street. I need to bus transition.\" It is. I give you a business card two hands. You give me back the M two hands. Exactly. For women, a lot of the things, this is going to sound so creepy, but a lot of times I see like underwear models D poses. There's like an Ariana Grande leak where she had this great photo where she was in her underwear, but she took it from up here and she's like really weird. I try to recreate those cause it's like pop stars really know their angles. They I'm a big fan of them in general. Do you want to check out you know some photos get some",

Do you want to check out you know some photos, get some good angles? Uh, take a lot of photos, delete the ones you don't like. Exactly. I think that's that's one of the major keys and angles is totally key. I think mirrors people need to realize mirrors are mirrors. Get the butt, get a little bit of everything. That's the thing. If you get that angle where it's like you can get from the camera, you get your you know, the the goodies up here and then in the mirror you get the the goodies back there. That is a pro maneuver. Plus, yeah, I've tried before. I've tried to send like nudes to my wife or just pictures of my anatomy and there's always like I try I'm like, how do I get the lowest angle? Do I put it on the ground so this thing looks like the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I don't know. It doesn't work. It always ends up looking like a bunch of kids running through sh... what?",

There's no lying to yourself when you're looking at the phone. And I would also say an important other tip is tease it. Don't like spread out right on the first one.
