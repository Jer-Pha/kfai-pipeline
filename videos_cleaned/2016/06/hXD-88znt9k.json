What's up, guys? I'm Greg Miller. State of Decay 2. Is this your go-to happy dance? I appreciate that. It's a happy dance. What do you want to do? I wasn't sure where the mic was. I'm happy that you're happy. You know, that's what E3 is about. Tim Gettys, Greg Miller, E3, here we go. Beautiful right here. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? It's back, people. It's multiplayer. Undead Labs back at it. So excited. State of Decay, criminally underrated, criminally underplayed. They put it out on Xbox One in that complete edition. If you haven't played it, go play it right now. If you don't own an Xbox One, buy that Slim and then the first thing you get is State of Decay. Watch our Let's Plays, youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames. Yeah, don't mock my speech pattern. All right, it was good. Okay, good. I don't have much to add here, Greg. You're the, you're",

I don't have much to add here, Greg. You're the, you're the guy. You're excited. This is your moment. There's dinosaurs in the back. I'm into that. Yeah, the big question for me is when there's been rumors for a long time that Undead Labs, shout out to Undead Labs, uh, they were making this multiplayer game. They were making a State of Decay that you can play with your friends. And some people, I remember hearing rumors that it was going to be huge and giant Country of Decay. Exactly. And like that's this trailer. I think almost gives that impression in a way. We have this car driving around with, you know, four people or whatever in it. And then you have other people fly, shoot off the flare. I think it might have been three in the car actually. But other people shoot off the flare and it gives off that thing of like, oh, cool, like, is it there giant number of people?",

They said on their blog post today, it's four people. So you're, it's a four, up to four players co-op. Yeah, I have a million questions about this. They said it's drop in, drop out. So I'm guessing then that I have my own game world. I'm doing my own quest. And then you can come drop in, help out. I'm sure they're not going to screw this up where Tim earns XP and has a great time and then jumps back to his world and has that XP and all the things he's gathered and stuff. Yeah, um, I'm not, I like that scope. That scope makes more sense. Undead Labs, great people, great developers, small team. And I think that with State of Decay 1, that was always one of the problems we saw. You know, it didn't run super well. It was kind of framing. The animations weren't awesome. And even when they",

The animations weren't awesome. And even when they brought it over, there was still hitches in the Giddy Up in terms of this like Super HD Xbox One PC edition. And so when you talk about a team that big taking on an idea that large of different settlements, different people, that is enough to make me step back and, hmm. But four people, I'm down with. I think they can do that. I assume that, yeah, it will be that. All right, I'm going to go on a supply run. Did you ever play State of Decay? I forget. No, f*** up, Jesus Christ, Tim. So like this would be one of those things where we are, know that there's a mission out here or maybe from somewhere else we've, you know, targeted, put it on our map. And so I could send out the three of you to go to that place. Meanwhile, I'm going to sit back and home, watch camp, see what's up. And then while you're there, can I do that? I want to",

And so then I, then I get to fire off the flare and bring you back. Cool. So that makes sense. I like where they're driving. If I'm getting it right, let me know. Undead Labs, follow Undead Labs on Twitter, everybody, because they're really cool folks. So is this your, your most exciting thing of E3 so far for you? Yeah, no, probably. I mean, in terms of things that have been announced at the show, as you know, I'm very excited to go to E3 tonight, see some stuff tomorrow and hopefully get my Supergirl and Green Arrow on for Lego Dimensions.
