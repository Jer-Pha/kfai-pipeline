What's up everybody? Welcome to E3 2016 on the GameSpot Co-op stage. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller from Kinda Funny, alongside the pride of Long Island from Kinda Funny, Colin Moriarty. Good to be here. Over there, Chris Watters from GameSpot.com. Hello. And right here, David Cage. David Cage, you son of a... did that game look good at that press conference? Oh, let me shake your hand. Oh, Detroit: Become Human. Good Lord, sir. I, you know what a fan of Heavy Rain I was, and I I let you lull me into a false sense of confidence because when I saw the the demo, you see Kara, I was like, oh, she's the playable character, totally makes sense. And then here we go, another AI pops up and we're going to be playing as him. I only... are there more? Are there more playable characters? Is it that much like Heavy Rain? What's happening? Who knows? God damn it.",

I mean, these games take a crazy amount of time just to be put together. So, so what's it like then, uh, to come out at the... not to come out, but to have the video come out at PlayStation and show something brand new and take people by surprise? Oh, well, yeah, we we, as you said, we announced the game at uh, at the Paris Games Week, and um, as you know, it was inspired by the short that we did before in 2012, where we introduced this character of Kara, uh, with an Android coming to life. And it was very um, interesting because people really enjoyed the short and they wanted to know what would happen to Kara once she leave the factory. And I didn't have a clue. So this is how",

And I didn't have a clue. So this is how everything started. And I just needed to imagine the story, uh, from there. That was the starting point for for Detroit. When you made the short, did you imagine your next game was going to be something completely different idea? Absolutely not. Because actually, when we worked on the short, it was just supposed to be a technical demo. I just needed to write something very quickly because we wanted to test how far we could go with emotions. And so the the the specs was, let's write something where we have a character going through very different emotions in 5 minutes. So that was the the the specs. And this is how I wrote the short. And then I wanted to expand this story. And I I I was really haunted by this question: what happens to Kara? Where does she go when she leaves the factory? And um, we started working on",

And uh, thought that maybe one character was great, but I wanted to go back to somehow what I did on Heavy Rain, telling a story from different perspectives with different characters through different eyes. And um, here we are at E3, introducing our second character called Connor. Now, great name. Now, the question then for me becomes, is is the story that they're all mixed up in more than just are Androids alive? Is there like a more... is there like, of course, we have the Origami Killer in Heavy Rain that was like unified all the different parts. Is this one just about Android rights, or is there more to it? Well, we tried to create a um, very complex story, uh, through multiple characters. And of course, the story starts separated.

Okay. So, uh, yeah, we this this format allows us to talk about many different things, many different topics. And uh, what we want to do with Detroit is not so much to create another story about AI or technology. Uh, we want to talk about human beings. We want to talk about us, about our society, about our present, our past, maybe our future. But we want to talk about human emotions. That's the most important thing for us. So that was one very important thing. And when in the writing, and the second important thing was to say, there have been many stories where we they were taking the point of view of humans and saying, oh, Androids are the bad thing, they are the virus, and they want to",

And I just wonder what would happen if they were the good guys? And maybe the humans are the bad guys. Maybe we are in a decline in society. Maybe we become selfish. Maybe we become more dependent to technology. What if they were the right the right thing? Oh, yeah. Tell me about about Detroit as a setting. Because in the United States, Detroit is looked at frankly as a very as a hyper decaying city, a city that's being abandoned basically. Um, I noticed that, uh, in the... it looked like to me that GM Towers, for instance, are there. Like, what? The city's been revitalized? Can you tell me a little bit about, uh, the reality of Detroit during this setting? Like, what happens is that that that AI becomes the new car manufacturing base there? Well, you know, I'm French.

Well, you know, I'm French. And yes, yes, I am. You didn't guess. Okay, good. Um, and um, maybe I have a different perspective on on the city and the east of Detroit. But I I was very fascinated by the story, uh, of this city, um, that was a big titan of the 20th, uh, century and went through hard times. And I thought that if the industry had to be born somewhere, they would probably need huge factories and a lot of space and and just go somewhere. And I thought Detroit would would be the perfect place for that. But it's also a great city for um, its cultural background. Um, music is fantastic in Detroit. Of course, there is Motown, and many artists were were born there. Um, and there's a lot going on. So we traveled to Detroit because we didn't want to write about a city from Paris. You see what I mean? So we spent a lot of time there, of course, taking pictures.",

So we spent a lot of time there, of course, taking pictures. And we visited the abandoned factories and the abandoned churches. But at the same time, we met the people. And we, uh, we were very surprised by the energy there and the fact that there is there are people who want to build something new here. And there's a lot of energy. And and there's definitely something happening in Detroit. That's that's how we felt when we went there. And I thought that all this combined made it the perfect background, uh, for the story that I wanted to tell. That was really, it's a very human story. Detroit as a city, it's a very human story. And it was the perfect background from my story. Nice. Chris, we're hogging him. Talk to David Cage. Talk to David Cage all day long. Couldn't we all?

Then you go to Beyond, and it's really just the two. And now with Detroit, you're spreading it back out Beyond more than two characters, I'd imagine. What have you sort of learned from that narrowing of focus with Beyond that you're carrying through to how you're giving the player agency across multiple characters in Detroit? Well, you know, I mean, we always try to find the best way to tell the story we we want to tell. And and sometimes it's multiple characters because we want different points of view. Sometimes it's on Beyond, it was logical to tell the story of one character because we wanted to talk about different moments in their life. Mhm. Detroit needed different angles.

And um, we also know that people really enjoy being in the shoes of different characters and switching from one to the other, uh, and just facing different situations and different dilemmas. And uh, this is exactly what we want to to offer them on Detroit. And you know, given what we were talking about earlier about the the character of Detroit, the city, and sort of the rejuvenation that you are in the version you're imagining, yes, to tell the story of a city, you really you do need those multiple perspectives. You need people in different social strata, in different roles and different places. So seems like those things intertwine. Yeah, absolutely. It expands the scope.

Well, speaking of bigger story, uh, you guys had a, you know, sort of the trailer, the presentation during the press conference yesterday. Uh, you really went at showing a visual representation of all the branching dialogue stuff, all the branching opportunities, branching ways that you know Quantic Dream has done so well in their previous games. Talk about that scope and sort of how you're how you're evolving that system in terms of your gameplay design approach.

So it's it's it's very complex to write, to be honest with you, because it very quickly becomes a mess. Yeah, I can imagine. Because there are tons of things, and you want to be absolutely consistent on the consequences that you give. You want them to surprise the player, but at the same time to be logical.

I don't understand how you write it. I worry. Don't understand either. I worry about the platinum trophy. How hard is it going to be to get this Heavy Rain Platinum? We both got the Heavy Rain Platinum. We had documents. We had to go through. It was like it was like a Beautiful Mind over there, like in our living room with all these things.

Because you could very easily make multiplatform games. Um, you know, we work, we came here at E3 10 years ago for the first time with Sony. We came with this short demo called The Casting that would become Heavy Rain later. And that was exactly 10 years ago. It was in 2006. So we have a very long-lasting relationship with Sony as a publisher. What I personally really enjoy working with them is the freedom they give me, uh, the creative freedom. And um, yeah, they support the fact that we try things. And uh, we don't always succeed. Sometime we we look for something, try something, you know, what doesn't work.

I mean, is this the power of this machine compared to the PS3 where your other two where your last two games lived? Has this given has this helped you tell your story more? Has it given you has the power really helped you or do you not necessarily need it like you would need to make say a Killzone game or something like that? You know what?

And then you need to scan actors and you need to have performance capture and you want the right rendering and lighting needs to be perfect. So it makes attention to the detail much more important. And uh, but at the same time, I don't think that technology is absolutely required to create emotion. It's just another tool, more colors on your palette. But that's it. Do you miss when it was simpler? When it wasn't so hard and there's shaders and lighting and scanning and there's a million things? Cause I have to imagine like you're talk...

So when you work on something that that tries to be different, you have a vision for it. You need to um, evangelize this vision across 200 people in your studio, which is more efforts for a game creator than if we were like 10 working on the same thing. And you know, you know what? It's it's a very different experience. So I think there are some very good sides to it because then you have the power and you can do incredible thing. And you really enjoy doing it.

Um, and I said, okay, I need I need to test it. So, um, we checked different systems. And of course, Morpheus, uh, from Sony. And I I realized that, yeah, it's it's really something different. It's really a new platform. Um, it's a new approach to interactivity in many ways.
