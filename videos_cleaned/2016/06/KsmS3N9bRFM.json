I'm a big fan of ice and I've always thought it's weird that Colin's not and it kind of bothers me that thing whenever we go to a restaurant for lunch. Colin or order a Coke, no ice, and then it comes and inevitably the the straw keeps popping coming out and going all limp on the top and he's got to shove it back in. There's nothing to hold it there, the surface tension trying to repel it and no anchor. Yeah, ice is totally unnecessary. Like, I never so the reason I get Coke with no ice is because have you ever really had a fountain drink at a restaurant that wasn't already cold? What is what is the point of the ice? It's literally like one in a 100 restaurants I go to the Coke is room temperature because I got it with no ice. Usually it's cold as if there was ice in it already. Mhm. So you're you're suffering from the principle of displacement and you're suffering also water",

So you're you're suffering from the principle of displacement and you're suffering also water from the principle of watering down. Want to water down a Coke? It was Socrates or Aristotle, I believe, one of those old **** that waited into a pool and notice that when they, huh, when when the water level rose and he understood that he was being that he was displacing the volume of liquid in the pool. Yeah, I think it was Socrates, but I could be wrong. Someone will let me know. It was one of them. It doesn't really matter. Probably. So so you're putting ice into a Coke, you're getting less Coke. Now usually that doesn't matter because you can get free, but it is sometimes not depending on where you are and also what country you're in. But I will say that I'm I'm not so displeased by the displacement as much as I'm displeased by the watering down and the dilution of the perfect mixture of the fountain",

Now what surprises me, Nick, is you're like, oh, I love the fountain Coke. The fountain Coke is the best, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you throw a **** ice in it and immediately immediately you're **** up the entire chemistry of the fountain Coke that is already cold and the ice is simply keeping it cold by how does something keep how does ice keep it cold? It's not through some sort of, you know, it's not like an exothermic or endothermic reaction. It is the water that is cold melting into the Coke and and and, you know, destroying the essence of it. An exothermic reaction it is, but what I'm saying is it's an exothermic reaction. That's true. That's true. That's true. But what I'm saying is that it's not happening with the ice staying the same.

So you you're correct that it comes out cold. I agree with that. But then it's better when it's colder and you're right that the water kind of **** with it. But let's all be real, Nick, aside, cuz you're wrong. Fountain drinks, period. Never as good as anything else. Oh, really? I don't I don't now that I I dis oh my God, I disagree with this. A great a great fountain beverage is oh my God, it's it's an orgasmic experience where you get it and it's got the right base of syrup and the right base of the the poppy cated water syrup.

As cold as humanly like like when when you turn on the water on cold on the fountain, you just I felt this bottle like 17 times. It's cold enough. No, it's plenty cold. Absolutely not to be so cold I can't taste it. But why? I don't get somebody who doesn't even drink that much soda. When I do want a soda, what I do is like we go to the movies. Like when we saw Batman v Superman like a million times, I wanted to treat myself. So I got the Cherry Coke and all I do is a like it's just a like I feather the ice thing cuz I don't want I want maybe a fifth of it to be like on the bottom, you know what I mean?

I want it a little bit cold, but I understand this desire to have it ice cold unless you've been working out and we know none of us have been doing that and then go and get a Coke. No, why would we? Uh, no, I like to get the world's biggest Coke or Diet Coke rather when I go the movies and I like to suck it down as quickly as possible. But it does take time and over time that's where the ice starts to be advantageous is when you're through the previews if you're still sipping that thing because it goes room temperature fast.

I don't like like 2-liters are the worst because you don't have it is a t it is a ticking time bomb. The minute you **** twist that cap off and you hear that, you have two, three hours max and then that Coke is finished. You know, you're supposed to screw the top back on. No, you do. It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. It's over. Matter. It's totally over. It's like when you drop a Coke too hard and like it's it's finished even before you open it.

So it's it's exothermic even if the ice melts in the water, isn't it a perspective thing where if you're looking at it? Do you think either of them know what the **** they're talking about on this one? I mean, they both know a little bit and they're trying to bring it together. Okay. Isn't it your mic? The the the energy is being transferred from one thing to the other, right? Exo. But it's not happening. It's happening because of the melting water is lit literally mixing with the Coke.

You never know what you're going to get. Same problem. So many issues with all of this cuz then we get to like what type of ice are we talking about? You know, we got those big old bourbon ice. My good lordes. I love those ****. Those things are great because they take a while to to melt. Yeah, but then then there's these these, you know, there's the cubes which honestly I don't really like the cubes.

If you put a straw in, it's hard for the straw to kind of navigate through all the big ass cubes and that causes an issue because then the if if you get a break in the straw, you're going to be suck and you can't get the maximum speed. I mean, just don't be an idiot and don't stab that hard would be the answer. Yeah, people are like, no, but that I'm talking about like when it's trying to navigate through all the ice.

That's one of the hazards of of using ice. But I'm with Tim. I like to I like to get it so where when I'm looking at the cup, you can see the ice just poking up over it and then fill that because inevitably it's going to melt it a little bit the second the fountain beverage hits it because the fountain beverage isn't ice cold.

Yes, because cold when it comes out and it's very cold when you put ice in it, eventually even out to a relatively cold soda.

Like and and you mix it like in, you know, in the in the um in like the beaker or whatever. True. Then he's like, so an Old Fashioned doesn't really become an Old Fashioned until it hits the ice and you mix it and then you pour it over ice. That so there's like there is something there.

But with with fountain drinks, see, I've gained it's the small pleasures in my life, Nick. And one of the things I used to really enjoy and I don't know if they do it anymore. I don't really go to McDonald's anymore as Kevin likes to go is that they have the little presets. Oh, yeah, yeah.

Again, I'm like, you should be worrying about about people like me, the minority that don't want ice in their food or in their drinks. But it goes a step further. The greater pleasure I take is when I go out to restaurants and we've all been there with me where say no, I order first and I'm like, Coke, no ice. And then every subsequent person is asked if they want ice in their drink. But otherwise they would never ask you. I know and they always **** it up. You're that guy.
