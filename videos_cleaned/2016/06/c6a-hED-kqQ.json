Greetings and salutations, welcome back to Kinda Funny Games. My name is Colin Moriarty. I'm here with Chris number one, Chris number one from Hairbrain Schemes. Chris number two is offscreen playing the game and we're here playing Necropolis. Necropolis, yeah, it's an action role-playing game. Looks like, oh yeah, it's a, we're calling it a 3D action Roguelike. Uh, so you're going to get like, uh, the, uh, Dark Souls inspired combat and you're also going to get a Roguelike, which in this case means procedural, so it's going to be different every time. Uh, and you get one life, so it's going to be permadeath. Yes, so it's going to be difficult. I like that. Yeah, now tell me about the origins of this game. Where did you guys come up with this idea? Uh, so, uh, me and Dennis, basically the creative director, uh, we're kind of knocking heads together trying to",

Uh, so, uh, me and Dennis, basically the creative director, uh, we're kind of knocking heads together trying to figure out how we, how do we blend something like Dark Souls, which we both kind of love, uh, with the Roguelike, so we can get that Infinite Challenge kind of going, you know, like just something we can just murder people over and over again. And the game is coming out soon. Obviously, you guys partnered with Publisher Bandai Namco/Namco Bandai, depending on when you're talking about. Uh, and, uh, it's coming out in July. I saw, I was reading a little bit online, is that correct? Uh, yeah, July 12th on, uh, Steam and, uh, PC, uh, sorry, PlayStation and Xbox later this summer. Awesome. All right, so, uh, you're small, tiny team, I'm sure. How many are you, by the way? Uh, for Hairbrain, we are about 50, some 50 or so. Uh, but yeah, we're, we, we're pretty big as indies go, uh, but we're split between two projects right now, so half of us",

Okay, cool. Oh, okay, you guys are doing that. Um, all right, so tell me what's going on on the game right here. Like, what are we, what are we looking at? What are we trying to do? You're like nameless Adventurer number 5663, you know, whatever. And, uh, basically you came here to the Necropolis, uh, which is like a mega structure, uh, of, you know, honoring the, the Wizard of Abraxis, who's like the most powerful wizard of all time. And so he built it to sort of house his conquests and his treasures and things like that. And you came here to get loot as adventurers do, as one would. Yes. Uh, so you find yourself trapped and you're trying to figure out, well, what happened to Abraxis? Nobody's seen him for a very long time. Uh, but also like",

Nobody's seen him for a very long time. Uh, but also like, where's all the loot? So basically it's, it's pretty simple premise. Um, and we try and take a lighthearted tone with it. You might see some of the, uh, the elements in here, like the, uh, Brazen Head, who is the caretaker of this place. Um, he'll crack jokes. He's kind of self-aware. He knows this is a dungeon delve. You, you probably wouldn't call it that, but you know, like a lot of the things are self-referential and in their humor. Like if he takes this, uh, skeleton out, you can probably look at some of the descriptions that some of these items have. Uh, yeah, you know, so Undead Warrior Short Sword kind of thing. Um, and so there, so we're kind of taking a lighthearted approach to the dungeon delve. Awesome. So I've noticed a lot of collecting, as one does in a game like this, of, of, uh, different materials.",

So I've noticed a lot of collecting, as one does in a game like this, of, of, uh, different materials. Seems like there's a crafting system of some sort. There is a crafting system. So you'll notice, uh, the stamina bar is like straight out of Dark Souls, that stamina sort of mechanic. Uh, but he's used Power Attack, so he's gotten some amount of exhaustion. Uh, and so he can, uh, take a munch on that ham hock and it'll actually restore some of that. So you're constantly trying to balance that stuff. And so you're going to want to craft new food items, you're going to craft potions and bombs and all sorts of good stuff. Yeah, I enjoy, you know, the Castlevania like eating of the meat during the games, the giant meat. Um, all right, so you're talking about how the game's procedural, which is awesome, because it is Roguelike, yeah. Um, what is, are the goals also obviously them procedural or is it just randomly generating task for",

Is there some sort of campaign or is it going to be really more like Rogue Legacy or something where it's like kind of just trying to get through the same thing over and over again? So yeah, you're trying to basically, well, as a player, develop your skills, but, uh, the, the goals that the Brazen Head give you are pretty much random. And, uh, so he's just going to try and say, you know, help me clear out the Undead on level three, that kind of stuff. Um, and if you do those, you'll get Tokens of Favor. So Tokens of Favor are, are the only thing that persist, or things you buy with Tokens of Favor, uh, between playthroughs. So what you're going to spend those on are basically codexes, which you can, uh, unlock, uh, new abilities like Super Jump or Vamprism, things like that. Um, you can also use them to open",

Um, you can also use them to open like the super sweet gold chest that's, uh, down by the elevator to sort of give you a leg up on this playthrough. Uh, but generally everything you get or collect is going to reset if you die. Okay, that's, I was going to ask. So like, so it's more like Enter the Gungeon than Rogue Legacy, where you are starting from scratch pretty much every time. Starting from scratch. Does nothing carry over? Is there, is, is it total? Those codexes and those, uh, Tokens of Favor, the only things carry over? Yeah, got it. So there is one, uh, saving grace to that. Uh, we do support four player co-op. So if you bring some friends, if you get down, uh, you have a chance for the your friend to resurrect you before like everyone is dead. So if it's in, in the multiplayer scenario, it's a total party wipe. Will keep you game over. Is it, is the",

I like the look. Like it's a, it's a, like a simple look, uh, and yet I think it really is quite effective and actually quite different than a lot of the games you see in this particular genre. Also from a third person action perspective, I like it a lot. Yeah, I mean, we're getting a lot of love for the look. Uh, Chris number two over here is our art director and, uh, he's had a big hand that. So, uh, we, we really enjoy that, that sort of stylized approach to it. It kind of keeps a lighter tone. It meshes well with the humor. Um, and honestly, it's just, it's, it's all good fun. So you, you can just kind of get in there. You don't have to worry about the nitty-gritty",

Little Zelda, or Link, I should say, type attack. Yeah, I, I don't know. This is, this is scratching my itch. Wish it was on, uh, wish it was on Vita. Just letting PR know. Wishing it was on. Please send emails. Send emails on. Yeah, okay, okay, great, perfect. Uh, not the first game I begged you to bring Vita, as we all know, over the years. Um, okay, so one of the things I like to ask with games like this, with permadeath, um, I was reading something interesting about, uh, id recently with, uh, Doom, the new Doom, um, how they do have a permadeath feature in the game on the hardest difficulty and talking about how far people in the studio can get and how far the QA testers can get.",

Are you guys messing around to see how far, whether QA or internally at your team, like who's the best, who, who has gotten the furthest? Like what is the long, what is the furthest a person has delved in? Yeah, I mean, we've definitely got a handful of people who are definitely better, uh, than others. Um, for instance, we have an artist who sits next to me. I think I told him just the other day, I think you're the officially the best person in the world at this game right now, uh, because he can, he can single-hand most of the game at this point. Um, but yeah, I mean, it's super difficult. We've been trying to tune down the, uh, the difficulty in some cases, tune it up in others, make sure that we have a kind of a consistent, uh, and, and sort of fun difficulty curve throughout, but both for single player and multiplayer.

I mean, what are you aiming for? Like, what is the aim for like game length? I mean, you guys have something in mind where it's like, if a person's last for a half an hour, that's considered pretty good or, yeah, yeah, yeah. So like, we get asked like, how long is the game? And that's kind of a difficult question to answer for a procedural game like this. But, uh, uh, if you're good, you can probably beat the game in probably about four to six hours. Okay. But it's going to take you much, much longer than that to develop the skills. Like even someone like a, uh, serious Dark Souls player is going to have a learning curve here, because it's, it's a little different. We've got our own takes on it and, uh, you know, you've got to learn everybody, all the enemies attacks and those kinds of things. So, um, do you have to play it all in one",

So, um, do you have to play it all in one burst or are you able to stop in the middle of your game as long as you haven't died? Yeah, you can totally stop, because like in four hours, that's a, that's an epic. I mean, I kind of, I kind of wish you were saying the opposite, which is that like, you know, you have to be pretty hardcore. You have to. We considered that. We consider that, but you know, sometimes you just got to go take a leak. So yeah, probably not the, the friendliest, uh, thing to do. Yeah. Oh, so similar to Dark Souls or Demon's Souls or Bloodborne, you can't really pause, right? No, there's no pause in here. So if you're in a, in a crafting screen or in a shop screen, people can totally sneak up on you and just like stab you in the back. I love that.

Yeah, he's playing this demo, which is currently limited to about 10 minutes. And if he survives that long, he's, he's sweating it over there. I'm pretty sure, uh, he gets dropped into an arena, uh, which is just special thing we've whipped up for the E3 here. And, uh, he's taking it as a pride, a matter of pride, because we've been doing a couple of these talks and, and, uh, you know, usually I'm the talking head and he's the thumbs, as he likes to say. Chris number two is the thumbs. Chris number one. Yeah, now I feel like, you know, you're attacking these what look like old man Warriors and I feel like they might just trying to be living their life and you're, well, yeah, so these are old adventurers.

Eventually they just got tired of trying to find it and kind of formed a cult of people who just want to live here and hoard things. So yeah, there are kind of go-to guys on these earlier levels. So, oh, that poor, that poor old man. He had a story. He had a story. He just ruined his life forever. Um, how important, I mean, we were talking a little bit more about the facetious nature of the game. Um, in terms of, you know, the codes and the way you guys write about, yeah, yeah, uh, everything. Uh, how important is the lore? I mean, like, is that, is that like kind of a tertiary or secondary kind of thing for you guys? Uh, I mean, what we have some world building going on.

Um, but we do a lot of Dark Souls style storytelling. You'll get snippets from like graffiti written on the walls and those kinds of things. We don't have a like in-your-face storyline. You're not ever going to get, oh, nice. Um, we don't have any like a direct storylines or cut scenes that are going to, you know, yank the controls from you. It's, it's all kind of passive storytelling. So this is the arena we're talking about. You made it 10 minutes. Yep. So after 10 minutes, it snatched him here and basically it's a Proving Ground.

Unfortunately, he's, you survived in the trip, but you know, he was, uh, he, but not this time. You can't prove it. So yeah, it says defeat at the top of the screen there. So all right, I'm liking the way this game's looking. So it's, it's called Necropolis. Comes to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC. Yep. July 10th, is that right? Uh, yeah, July 12th, 12th, July 12th. I'm sorry. And then Xbox and PlayStation later this year or this summer. And, uh, Bandai Namco/Namco Bandai codes ASAP. So we can, we can do a Let's Play.
