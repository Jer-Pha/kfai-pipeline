My example, of course, Portillo, who's laid out on the floor over there. Come here. He's dead. All right, well, Kevin was petting him with his foot, so I understand why he'd want to hang out over there. But that's the thing I never thought I'd have a dog growing up, you know what I mean? I was a cat person. I was going to be a cat person the rest of my life. God damn it, Greg, what? You were a cat person? Yeah, what? I was raised with cats, and cats are cool. I was too. I am. I feel, I feel weird about this overall. I feel like, what do you feel weird about? L, I don't know. I think that I think it's weird that being a cat person is acceptable. I grew up in a world where cat people were weird. But no, but I mean, we've taken that back, you know what I mean?

Enjoying a cat, I feel like there still are cat people and dog people. It's like you got to make a choice. But how are you a cat person growing up? My parents were cat, my mom was a cat person, so she had cats and I was raised with cat and I got my own cats and I had three cats and there was cats in the house. That's how your cat. I don't mean I was wearing shirts with cats on them. Got it. That's the thing. I, if by that I mean, I grant that I make the the **** shirts about Portillo, but like there's way more dog Pride in me, I guess, and there ever was cat Pride, if that helps you out.

Okay, so then when I graduate and the ex is wanting a dog and I'm all against it or whatever, I, I was like, uh, you know what I mean? Then we, she, I mean, she forced me to go to this Puppy Love Haven place out in Mexico, Missouri. Now closed, rest in peace, Big Ups. But it was 30 minutes outside of town, so when we were driving out there, I knew I was getting a dog, even though I was like arguing against getting this dog and she's just like, let's just go look, let's just go look. We walked in, there was a Basset Hound, but she had her eyes set on this **** little teacup garbage dog that's like basically a skeleton that's never going to get bigger than the palm of your hand.

So then I immediately started panicking and looking around the room and I, I saw the Basset Hound. I'm like, this is an American dog. If I have to get a dog today, can we at least get an American dog? We started arguing about that, of course. Surprised this marriage didn't work out, arguing about this, whatever. And then finally some lady brought in Portillo and put him down and I was like, is that a wiener dog? And she's like, yes. And I turned to the ex and I'm like, if you let me get this wiener dog and you name, we name it Portillo, I'm in. I won't, I won't complain. I'll help out. No big deal. And it was like, okay.

I look at him and I'm just like, I never expected this idiot to be part of my life. This was never part of the plan, you know what I mean? Yeah, I get it, man. That's what I'm talking about. That kind of where your life changes on a dime where all of a sudden you're taking care of this thing, chilling out over there with it weird eyes.

I'll name you two right now. One, it requires very little, if not zero energy from me, so I can just lay back. And two, you could have sex that way too. I don't feel you've never been married.

I mean, when it really push comes to shove, millions of people have listened to what we've said. And, um, and there, I would say probably tens of thousands, about 100,000 or more people out there in the world that really consider themselves fans of ours and fans of mine, maybe. And I think that that's pretty cool. Um, so I never expected to have that. No matter like, I joined the industry when I was 18 officially and I've been, I was writing since I was 13 in the gaming industry. So I've been doing this for a long time. But I never, and I always wanted to be well known in my mind as a writer, but never did I think that it would get to this point where, you know, we do Kinda Funny Live too and I walk out and it's like a **** critical claim or",

Like I actually do something that matters. So I really appreciate, um, everyone for that. The other thing I want to say that I'm thankful for that never thought I'd have is Greg. And what I mean by that is we often see, and I think Greg sees them too, but we kind of, I don't know if you ignore, we should get a lot of comments. Someone that you have such rapport with that you couldn't almost ever imagine not having something in your life that you do with them, which is why I think PS I Love You, bringing PS I Love You XOXO back actually kind of filled something that was missing at least from me in our lives where it could just be something that he and I do together.

I don't know if there's anyone else with the exception of maybe a couple people like Gerstmann and, you know, his partners or whatever, where it's like that you've done literally five, six, 700 podcasts with 300 or 400 morning shows, sat next to the person for years, worked on the same channel, just have like an unspoken code between each other where we're mad at each other or happy with each other. We good, we're in good shape or bad shape or whatever it is. Like that always kind of exists.
