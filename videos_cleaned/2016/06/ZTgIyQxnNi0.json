Yeah, the combat system is much improved from The Stick of Truth and it's superhero, it's a superhero game so it has the combat is definitely the center. Yeah, actually it was actually pretty cool because we, Ubisoft, and the guys from Ubisoft, we'd come down and talk about what this game would be and we, we'd go back to my house afterwards and play board games because I'm a big board gamer. So we'd play all like my favorite board games and tabletop miniature type of games and figure out how to, you know, we didn't, we still wanted to keep some of the turn-based stuff because it, it really makes it easier to do story and so, um, so just tried to do a big 4.0 version of The Stick of Truth, right?

Now you can move to get into tactical positions on your enemies. Oh, you can also move to get behind cover. You can push and pull enemies but they can also do it to you. You can knock them into props and get a little extra damage. You can knock them into other characters and get an extra attack. You can use some of your powers like Tweek here to get over obstacles. So obviously using space makes a big difference. Totally realistic. Next up is time. In the first game your farts were legendary. Now your farts are so powerful that you can use them to rip the fabric of time itself like Ghost Recon. Damn. So you can use that to rearrange the turn order. Mastering space and time",

Mountain View allows you to zoom out from your position observe the world and navigate into the environment our mountain range will be populated by drop zones. Drop zones are entry points for you to drop in the world when you're ready now let's get back to our initial position besides drop zones the game will offer a wide range of challenges for you to test skills the one in front of us is a Wingsuit activity and as the other player drops in we'll follow him and triggers a challenge this is a proximity flying race challenge the only like the way they Salvage it is like we have a story mode it's Loosely based on Point Break you're like all right then this all makes sense V.I. oh **** that guy was symbolic of this press conference we just secured the silver medal and as we leave we could choose we could choose and",
