I will fight him on stupid thing to die, period. Um, so my topic is brought to you by one SnowBikeMike, AKA my favorite person to talk to in life. Wow, this is of our, one of our best friends out there over on Patreon. We get to talk to him every once in a while doing our Q&A, and he just speaking of bringing laughter, that shit brings hits. I enjoy him, he's funny as all shit. So last time we talked, we had a discussion about ticket scalping and how the hell it works. So I did a little research into, did you just a little bit? Okay, by a little bit, I mean Googled it five minutes ago, but I do have some articles that I'd like to refer to at some point in this topic. But I just want to present it to the table, how the hell is this a thing? We've been to concerts, we've been, some of us have been to sports shows.

Um, I love going to a sports show, there's always my favorite athletes, some dingers at the game in the, yeah. So there's always people out there and they're always selling tickets, they're always trying to buy tickets. What's going on with this? How do they get all these goddamn tickets? They buy them at Costco? No, it's fascinating. It is a fascinating thing. I've thought about it before, but I never thought about it too deeply actually until we talked to him on on Skype. And it is, when I think about, I've been to many, many, many, many sports games in my life, sports shows, and uh, I've been to many, many, many concerts, right? So you see these things and I've scalped before, like I've totally bought scalped tickets and I've sold tickets, me too.

And I don't know if they still do it, but Fenway would release 200 standing room only tickets every night before the next game. And you, it would be like, actually be like in the morning, like 6:00 in the morning. So I used to sleep out there, sometimes I think Rone used to come sometimes, and they, they would sell you a maximum of two tickets for $10 each. And all I would do was I'd buy two, I'd go with one of them, and I'd sell the other one for $40 just to make my money back on both tickets. And, and that was it, because stand tickets suck. But uh, and you know, and I've purchased obviously, you know, tickets from people as well. But to me, it's like, it's just, it is fascinating getting a glimpse into the ecosystem. Oop, sorry.

People down there with the signs around their necks, tickets, buying tickets, selling tickets, parking passes, everything you could possibly imagine. Well-dressed individuals clearly making money, making deals on their phones with a, with an amazing amount of like entrepreneurialship, I guess. But there is like, I do not understand the buying and selling nature and how you make money, because it seems like when I'm walking by in the fourth inning, they're still selling these tickets.

Like you have to imagine Facebook probably has, or Google or Twitter probably has not only their box for their executives, they probably have like 50 tickets per game, sure. And they're just like, well, no one, you know, we don't even, we forget they even have, they probably have the giveaway though. Do you think Facebook's really selling those tickets? No, no, they're giving them away. What I'm saying is that someone is probably taking, like there's probably something where someone's like, I'll take 100 of them. And then they're like, shit that. And then they sell them to someone who then sells them. Yep. Is that right? So from the limited research I did, what it sounds like is you're right, it is Facebook.

And their thing is they know that even like those, the people out there, that's the last line of defense. Before that, there's the StubHubs and all the, the websites and shit where that's where they're really making money, 'cause they're marking those tickets up three, four times the price of the tickets. So they're making a ton of money there. The people we see on the streets, that's the end, that's the last, the last ditch effort to try to make some money back. So they're paying these guys minimum wage to be out there, sometimes not even minimum wage.

So what they're doing is they invest so much that if they lose millions of dollars a year, it's fine, because they're making millions of dollars a year, like more. So that's the whole game there is they're totally, they buy like, they'll buy in bulk or they'll get in bulk 50 tickets, knowing that they can sell them for two to three times as much and take a loss on how many they sell. Yeah, but end up netting positive in the end. So if they get their 50 because of how cheap they get the 50 in the beginning, right?

So what you're saying is the guys on the street aren't the guys that are going to Facebook specifically and getting them, this outside organization that's actually interfacing with Facebook. Yep. And then those guys in the streets are just kind of the, the, just the, the worker bees, the worker bees. They're out there, the queen sitting at home. Where do the pre-sale people enter into the picture? 'Cause we, you know, Mike Mitchell had 49ers season tickets, so we always got first crack at anything coming to Levi's.

And then try to flip them myself. I assume there's a network underneath the kingpin. So that's the thing, that's a totally different, there's a lot going on here. So from, from reading this, what it sounds like is when these, these concerts or the sporting events, they, the number that they say of attendance is tickets sold. So it's not actually people there. So they don't give a shit really. Like the, the question of how is this legal? There, it does get to a point of city by city, like each ordinance has different rules on how you can scalping, resell, and is it illegal, is it not illegal?

This is a big thing in, just a side note to get back to it, a big thing at Mizzou when we, we'd go camp out for tickets at the Bragging Rights Game at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis. Um, you couldn't resell the tickets above face value. So what people would do is go on eBay and put the two tickets in there along with a pen and buying the pen, but we're including these tickets. And that, that's the workaround from what it sounds like in the majority of places in America. And there's definitely exceptions, but majority of places you're allowed to resell tickets, you're not allowed to sell fake tickets. Okay. And like that's the obvious thing. But you, you cannot uh, lead people to believe that these are tickets that will work, even if you're using any weird pen shit.

And but the, the weird thing there is if there, if that happens outside the event, if they sell that, the cop needs to see it happen, or else they have nothing to go off. Gotcha. Yeah. So then, 'cause I was reading stories about people that got in trouble where they sold fake tickets. There was a cop, they had to grab the cop, then they had to find the guy that sold them the fake ticket. And that wasn't enough. They had to then show like, follow them and wait till they did it to somebody else to catch them. I'm like, all right. So how did this come up with SnowBikeMike? I don't remember. Okay. But it did sound, came, it came up literally being like, what is the deal with this? How does this work?

And I've often thought, I remember when I saw Faith No More when they had first come back, um, substantial rock band, hadn't played in a long time. And, and I, and I uh, saw them at The Fillmore, I think. And, and I could, I bought two tickets, but I could have bought like a maximum of eight. And it crossed my mind where I'm like, I'd probably make a thousand profit by buying all these tickets right now, easy. But then like, my whole thing is like, I'm not really hurting for money at all, like none of us are. And I'm like, I don't want to do that to a Faith No More fan. I'd rather at least make someone else do that to them than rather than me. I don't want to do that or make it so that six other people that really want to see go. It's not even the work",

Um, if you want to do that, but I just don't want to get involved in that, because I'd be really shit upset if I wanted to see Faith No More and the only way I can get a ticket is some shit is selling it for four times what he paid for it when I just want to go see this music, whatever. And the band's not seeing any more money, you're seeing it. So it's like, so I, I, I can kind of sympathize with that. I don't really want to get involved in that kind of stuff.

But uh, yes, well, PAX Prime is probably the better show. Oh, I agree. Well, PAX is pretty awesome. PAX is nice. But so anyway, like the one thing I like, the one thing I like to do is when I go to, I go, when I go to Jets games, is I play, is I play what you know, the Pornhub game of chicken. Um, Pornhub's Pornhub's ticket prices scale wildly from week to week in the NFL. If you pay attention, what, what's so funny about that? Oh, Pornhub. I said Pornhub. I was like, like, wait a minute.

Well, that'll be a good video you can put on the for the new forum post that you should check out about videos. StubHub, the StubHub game of chicken. Uh, week to week, wildly the prices fluctuate depending on how teams are doing in the matchup. So like, you can have these really terrible like Jets-Browns matchups in like week 17 where both teams have four wins and you can get, you can like, basically they pay you to go. Or you can like, wait. So like, we play this game often with my friends back home and we, we played it last time and we lost terribly where you can like really wait and see and like hope against hope that the guys at the Jets are going to play week seven when you go to the game, game they",

Or it could be like a really competitive game, like they're predictable ones. Everyone always wants to see the Patriots play the Jets and stuff like that. So you could get those tickets as early and as cheap as possible. For me, uh, I'm more fascinated by that market because that market is totally driven by uh, market economics as opposed to like, um, as opposed to like the last minute people that go to these games and want a ticket or like the desperation that people will pay like to pay like five, six times more than ticket face value. So I, I approach people to go to Pornhub to watch porn, but to go to StubHub to see that, to see the, to see the uh, the wild scaling in ticket prices for NFL games specifically.

And one of my friends got really up, one of my friends got really upset with me, um, when I went, went and saw the Jets and the Colts play a few years ago, because I didn't wait long enough and the Jets were like 2 and 0 or 3 and 0 and I bought the tickets and then they lost like three games in a row or something like that and the ticket prices fell like 50 or 60%.

That's kind of what's interesting about scaling is that I, the internet hasn't made it irrelevant and it's worked hand in hand.

Internet has made it so good that they are profiting so much from you just go, I mean, you can go on StubHub on your phone.
