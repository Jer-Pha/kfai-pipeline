What's up, guys? Welcome to the first ever E3 2016 Day Two Kinda Funny Games recap. I agree, it's Day Two of E3, but we had two days of work before Tech. It's almost over, almost. I'm having a good time though. I knew you would. See, this is a fun E3. It's all right. Either I want to talk about, I want to talk about what we, what we got to play today. Colin, yeah, what did you play today? Uh, I only played one game, which was Horizon. We just did a conversation about that. Uh, it's PS4 exclusive from Guerrilla Games. Uh, saw behind closed doors, saw a new part of the game, then played it myself. Uh, you guys can watch the conversation we'll put up about it for like the full impressions, but the brief take on it is this game is going to be **** huge. Um, it is really fun. It's uh, robust. It is interesting. It is intriguing and um, that's why I",

And I still think that it's, I, I would still think it's very much an running to win the Game of the Show award again. Are your, are all your faces out right now? No, you still got one in the play. Yeah, I don't know what I'm going to do with it. Okay, there's something, some things I saw today that I might uh, want to uh, throw out there. So, so then I saw, let's see, one, two, four other games today. Uh, so I went to Telltale and I saw Batman. Thoughts? Uh, I like it. I mean, it's intriguing. I like Batman, like as a character. I like that world. I like the universe. And, and um, I thought it was, it was, I know you saw it too. I thought it was uh, interesting. Again, I don't know that I want to play it episodically.

Hopefully it doesn't get spoiled for me, who knows. But the one thing, my one takeaway from it is that it was, he was playing with an Xbox 360 controller, indicating to me that it was on PC. Yeah, and it was still chugging. That's what you said in the text to me and I found that interesting 'cause they were talking to me that I was, my demo yesterday was their first of the day before they went, before the doors opened. And they said they were getting a new build and my build, I'm not even Telltale fanboying, like wasn't chugging. And I, because I thought, oh man, it's running so well. So for chug for you, that sucks. Well, yeah, it wasn't like chugging constantly, but there were, there were probably three or four moments where I was like, their frame rate dropped or like was transitioning to another scene or whatever. It's not optimized yet. I mean,",

It certainly was running better and it looks better. They now, but you know, Job Stauffer, who's our good friend over at Telltale, um, who's like their PR marketing guy, very nice guy. He kind of busted my balls, me, I can't believe you're even here to see this game. He knows how much **** I talk about them. Um, but I wanted to see it and you made that appointment for me because I'm such a big Batman fan. Um, but I was a little disappointed. If there was one thing I was disappointed about in the conversation, we, the guy, the guy playing it was talking about like how all the, someone asked like, how did you update the engine? Is this the new engine? He's like, well, we added K physics and this, that. I'm like,",

Like it's a matter of, you know, the pipeline and I get all that kind of stuff. But all told, uh, super positive on it. Excited to play it, will play it. It also made me kind of intrigued just watching the, the, it's a Telltale Game. It plays exactly like any Telltale game. It's nothing different about it. But um, I do, it's, it is, it does remind me that I still need to get back to The Walking Dead. I, I, 400 Days was the last thing I even played in Telltale Game and that was ages ago. I played that on PS3. So, um, so it made me want to get back to that as well. And then, and then I saw a trio of first party games. I think Greg saw one of or two of. You saw, got, we saw God of War.

So you can watch really long form kind of things about these if you want. But God of War looks great. Very reactive to the all the problems that we had with God of War. I think you would agree. Kratos being a one-dimensional, angry, nonsensical character seems to be solved in this. They changed the camera angle to a more traditional third-person controllable camera instead of a fixed angle camera or in a mobile camera. Um, combat seems to be a little bit more refined. There are role-playing elements. My comparison when I saw the trailer to Tomb Raider seemed to be apt since Cory Barlog, who is the director of the game, said it is like Tomb Raider. It's a more open sections that are patched together. So,",

Uh, saw uh, Detroit, um, which is extraordinarily **** cool. Um, I can't wait. They played the section of the game uh, that we saw in the trailer twice. Um, and really explored the mechanics of the game. One of the cool things that they show with this character, Connor, and I'm not sure if it's going to be with all the Androids or just everyone, is that every choice you make and how much time you spend, like it actively shows you like what your percentage of uh, success is going to be with your particular mission. And so the more time you take in this, the more that whittle down. But if you take the time and use it wisely and do smart things, then that time can be um, that time could be well, well spent. You",

What was cool about it was there was like a boiling pot of water on the stove and he didn't even go after it, but I, I sense that if you went to that, that would just a waste of time. Like go shut it off. Like that doesn't do anything for you. You can scan it. So go watch that conversation too on on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames because that's, I think that game is a return to form for Quantic. And I think people, and I think people are going to really be really excited about because I think Beyond: Two Souls, I think large, I think most people understand that that game was just not very good. Um, and uh, and then we, I saw Days Gone, which is uh, Bend's game. And those guys were busting my balls a little bit in there. Um,",

And they, Eric Jensen got a shout out from them and all that kind of stuff, who was the lead senior game designer over at Bend. Uh, I think the game is really cool and I'm pulling for them. I think that the game is going to be a lot of fun. I like the aesthetic of it. I think it looks well, looks good. It runs on Unreal 4, which is really weird for a first-party game from Sony. Um, it's all about these hordes of creatures called um, God, what the **** are they called? I can't remember. No, no, no. Uh, ****, I can't remember it. I'm so tired. Anyway, the point of this is that they're not dead. They're not zombies. They're alive. They need to eat and drink and sleep. Um, so they are like a little more, they're a little smarter and a little more tactical and they work in number in large numbers. And the",

And the idea in this particular part of the game that we saw, which is part of the game that we saw during the trailer, just played in different ways to just eliminate those numbers. Um, the one interesting thing that we didn't talk about in the conversation, which I think is, is interesting and I was talking to someone about this, was there's something more to read in Days Gone than the simp, the game itself or with Bend. This game indicates to me that The Last of Us 2 is not going to happen. Um, because if they're releasing a game that looks like it belongs in The Last of Us's universe and then assume it comes out 2017 or 2018, The Last of Us 2, 2018, 2019, they're going to release these two games back-to-back from each other. I don't think so. Like, so this indicated to me more than just the game from Bend",

Like, so this indicated to me more than just the game from Bend itself. This indicated to me maybe a different, if they, if they allowed this game to go forward, then is, does that mean The Last of Us do something else? No, that's just total conjecture. But I just don't see, I just don't see them having 18 months apart games that are basically identical in terms of their feel, in terms of the way they look, in terms of their settings, even though the stories are obviously very different. So you figure maybe the gameplay could be the differentiator, right? You're talking about the earlier in, in the conversation, you can catch of shooting a machine gun with 800 bullets and stuff. That's not Last of Us. Freakers, Freakers, nailed it. I think you get to get away with it that, that way in the same way like, hey, here's Dead Rising 4 and State of Decay. Like zombies are still in.

Like zombies are still in. I know everyone keeps waiting for this fad to end. It isn't. And I'm one of the main guys who loves it, so I'm great. But well, that was the thing that they were saying. I mean, the guys from Bend were saying like, we know we're on the cusp constantly of it being too much. Like I do think zombies are too much, but like there are examples of it being done right. No one's really tired or few people are, but a lot of people aren't tired of The Walking Dead yet. Their numbers are still killing when they're on AMC. People are still buying these games from Telltale and are excited about Walking Dead Season 3. Dying Light is a zombie game uh, that was that found great success. State of Decay was a game that found great success over and over again. Dead Rising 4, as you mentioned. And I just feel like if the games are done",

Yeah, they look like zombies. They're, and they're fast like some zombies are like that. But I don't know, to me it's uh, to me I'm super intrigued by um, the, the, the narrative potential of this particular game. Takes place in Oregon, which is a strange place for a game to take place. There are no big cities or anything like that. Lazy ass developers just looking out their window like, let's just set it in Oregon. God. Um, but the one thing that I want people to take away from and we talk, we talk about this in um, in the conversation, uh, is this game might not seem as, it might not be as close as we thought.

Uh, you know, are we, are we close? Like you guys have been so silent for so long. Is this, is this a 2017 game? Is it safe to assume that? He's like, that's not safe to assume. And so I didn't know, you know, to, to what we were talking about before, does it mean it's 2016? Highly unlikely. Uh, does it mean that they're just not ready to dedicate themselves 2017? Probably. Is it possible that it's going to be 2018? Maybe so. Um, but how much, you know, if they really do release this game in 2018, that was seven years since they released a game. And that's like really kind of absurd. So I hope that that's not the case. Greg, yeah, what did you get to play today? I played a bunch of stuff today. I'll tell you what I",

Somebody hits me up and they go, would you like to come see a Vita game? At which point I say, yes, I would. XSEED, I would love to come see a Vita game. I went and saw Akiba's Beat. You remember, of course, Akiba's Trip, of course. PS4, Vita, exactly. Instead, I went to see Akiba's Beat. Nick Scarpino bringing in beverages. Bring, yes, yes, bring. Do you got a bottle opener?

They're themed about what you, where you are. It's like the maid cafe got taken over. We went in there and fought in a maid cafe like dungeon. Uh, there's an idol dungeon they showed. Uh, gameplay is simple. It's, you know, in the moment action. It's not like turn-based stuff like Persona. You can hop around to whatever character you want to be. Uh, you don't get to customize them in any certain way. So it's like, okay, cool. Uh, this guy uses a pistol. This guy uses a sword. That's how it works. That's your party.

We, we again, just similar to Colin, have the reactions up already. But to put it out there in C, because this is, this video isn't sponsored. Uh, Ghost Recon Wildlands, holy **** **** was that fun. So that is a game Kevin Coello and I will be playing. We will be playing that at night. I will be having dates with Fran. Fran will be in our group. We'll be playing it. Sorry, I know you don't like Fran, Kevin, but we're going to, that was so much fun to go in there, find people, mark the targets, take them out, communicate with each other.

We were all very impressed by it, but we were all kind of like, all right, guys, nobody's going to roleplay the characters this way, whatever. And granted, we are at Ubisoft with the Ubisoft guy leading us. So he kind of set the tone. But he was like, all right, I'm Ghost Leader. You're Ghost One. You're Ghost Two. You're Ghost Three. And the whole time we just kept on the headset referring to each other that way. And right, I'm going to do this. Tangles over there. We were, but it was so much fun.

Of like, we're all sitting there sniping and then like, you know, one guy screwed it up. And like they knew. And it was like, go. Well, that was my major takeaway from the, from the kind of scripted thing they did at at the Ubisoft press conference, which was, um, you know, they have this situation where like they're, they're infiltrating this camp and then this guy blows it at like the last minute.

Who's sharing the vehicles? Who's going to be the gunner? Whatever. Then you get there and then it becomes, all right, we got to mark the targets. So you do that. You send your drones out. Thank you. Uh, the drones go fly out. You got to mark all the, the enemies and whatever. Then there's like, all right, you got to kill those guys. Be there. Keep that guy alive.

Like we need to make sure he's with us too. So it like, it's for a clown, get him. It was cool. And then it's like, I, it was a fun, very progressive moving thing. And the, I, I wonder how interesting it's going to be for hours on end. See, my thing is, I think it's going to be very interesting 'cause it just like the trailer gave me vibes of The Division, of the parts of The Division I really dug. Of either how you played it solo, where I played it with Fran all the time. Of like, cool, we're out on these missions. We're bullshitting around, talking to each other.

And then it's, it doesn't seem like the endgame is going to be The Division's where it's like, all right, let's get a gear. Let's do this thing. Yeah, it's definitely very interesting.

And like it made it kind of like, it was, it was really interesting, especially having Nick kind of take uh, lead on it where Nick was the captain and he's like directing the ship and stuff.
