Our games encourage replay in order to try different play styles so that players are free to play their own way. In 2012, we released Dishonored. We were thrilled that the game was so well received by the gamers and the critics all around the world. Uh, that was like one of the best feeling for for us developers. After that launch, my friend and Co-Creative Director, Harvey Smith, uh, took the lead on Dishonored. So he went to France in Lyon and worked with the team over there.

Father, every year I think the anniversary of Jessamine's death will be easier, but it never is. I wish mother was still the Empress. I don't think I'm very good at this. You're still learning. Don't worry about the rabble-rousers and we'll catch the Crown Killer eventually. People are saying it's you, but these assassinations are a misguided effort to protect me. No, someone's trying to make us look guilty by targeting your enemies. I wish I could just run away from all this sometimes. You do. You think I don't know about your nights out on the rooftops? Courage. The ceremony will be over soon. Royal Protector and father. I should have passed a law against that combination of titles years ago.

Emily and Corvo are both fully voiced this time, with their own perspectives and emotional responses to the events transpiring around them. Whether you choose to play, whoever you choose to play, you've got to flee Dunwall, your home, and travel to Karnaca in order to unravel the threads of a conspiracy and take back what's yours. I've got to get away. I should talk to the captain of that ship. I wonder if he chose the girl or the guy. Dishonored is known for unscripted, simulation-driven missions where no two players ever have the same experience.

In the Dust District, a militant religious faction called the Overseers is at war with the Howler Gang. The leaders of both factions are trying to take each other down. You can side with the Overseers or the Howlers or neither. There are many ways to complete the mission. She'll tell you more. I'll wait here in skip, take you back to the Dreadful Whale after you fin call. They don't like taxes either.

From the Duke, we're losing too many people, good soldiers blinded by that hallucinogenic powder the Howlers use, then stabbed to death or dragged down by the Abbey's Hounds. One young Lieutenant got hit by an Overseer grenade, one of the D ****. Let's hope they do enough damage to each other so the fight goes out of them. That won't happen until someone manages. We've made much greater use of vertical space for Dishonored, encouraging players to explore the rooftops above the streets. Out of my ears. Uh oh, seemed unnecessary. I would have let you pass.

Far Reach can be upgraded not only to pull objects from the distance, but also enemies so you can finish them off in midair. So I think this, this game looks great, but this is killing the momentum of the, of the press conference. Everyone has to get in their own way all this time.

We're very close to Vice Overseer Burn's office now. Will the Sisters of the Oracular Order have seen it? And I feel it in my wounds. What do you feel? Burn is giving a briefing using a projector. We're going to plant a stun mine and then link several of the Overseers with Emily's Domino Power so that whatever happens to one of them will happen to all of them. They share the same fate.

There are many creative ways to use Domino. Now we're going to show you Shadow Walk, another key power for Emily. Shadow Walk is useful for stealth and combat. You saw it in the, uh, announce trailer that we made for the game and you can fully use it in the game. Like all the powers, it can be upgraded in a variety of ways. With Vice Overseer Burn out of the picture, the leader of the Howlers will owe Emily a favor and that's just one way to complete the Dust District Mission.

Flying around this house like Sokolov explains that reality was warped inside this place after an occult event. Your supernatural powers won't work inside the manor and even time behaves strangely, allowing you to travel back and forth between the ruined present and the past when the manor was lavish and refined. See, Marty liked it. Marty liked sweaters too and beards. Here we're in the present when the manor is in ruins. That's cool.

They've been working their butts off. Now, one of the things that Dishonored fans have been asking about a lot is whether or not we're going to do a Collector's Edition. So tonight, I'm happy to confirm that yes, we will be doing a limited number of Dishonored Collector's Editions. The Collector's Edition comes with a very cool replica of Corvo's mask as well as, uh, Emily's ring, and it'll be available through retailers around the globe.
