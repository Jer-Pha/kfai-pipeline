Are you rested and relaxed from E3? No. Where did you get that shirt from? I got this from the PlayStation Gear Booth outside of E3. They had a whole bunch of new stuff over there. You don't like it? I, I do without it. I'm a big fan. You know, like, I got to be honest with you, I think the most that you usually typically wear very nice attire. Yeah, this shirt I can do without. What's wrong with it? This shirt is a little too much. It's a little too 90s for me. It's a little too, I'm looking at myself in the monitor. I think I look pretty goddamn good. To each his own.

Yeah, I've been, uh, you know, today Lola and I had to go to Petco. Yeah, get our nails trimmed. Need to get her some food. Got her some toys. Okay, so you know, there's things to do. I understand. That's, that definitely right there is enough to keep you not rested, not relaxed. I had to think about that for a long time as I did it. Get psyched up for it. Did you play anything since E3?

Uh, it's a little more simplistic, I would say, in a way than the grid-based games like Final Fantasy Tactics. But basically, you're just going around a map with up to four characters in your party. Um, and then you run into enemies and then there you fight them on a grid. But the grid's like three lines and then you can like go in between the lines and fight them and there's different character classes. And play it for a few hours. It's pretty good. I'm going to restart it because I did make like a, a significant error in the game that I need to, um, to fix basically. Seems like after, no, I wouldn't make that after, uh, that, uh, tutorial open.

But it's like a full-fledged mission and the missions are like multiple fights and all those kinds of things. And I, uh, so I was playing with a, a cast of characters.

Like, all right, hire four more characters. So I'm like, all right, I'm going to hire like all characters for these.

So I, I want to go back and just fix that. Interesting. Um, other than that, haven't, I mean, before E3, I played Mighty No. 9. Talk about that. No, no, no, no, no. I haven't beaten it. I don't really care about it. Um, we had it for about two weeks before the embargo lifted. Uh, it's, um, not good. I, I don't know that I would call it bad. I just think it's, uh, it's soulless.

Evan writes into kindafunny.com/psq, just like you can, to get your question read and says, greetings and salutations. Reviews are in for Mighty No. 9 and the consensus seems to be that it's a mediocre on most fronts game.

I mean, they have an idea of making this into a sequel, whether or not anyone will care about it long enough for it to be a sequel, they get a sequel remains to be seen here. This is the thing, this is what I was trying to say. Inti Creates creates awesome games. People had brought up, um, uh, Azure Striker Gunvolt and all these games. These are great games. Uh, they're working obviously on Bloodstained, which looks fantastic. It was playable on the floor. I didn't get to play it at E3. Um, have you played it before?

Like they make, they know what they're doing. There's a bigger problem here and I hate to say it because Inafune is like one of my very favorite people in the industry and I love him to death and I, I love, you know, what he's done and you know, he, he had a hand in Dead Rising, he had a hand in Onimusha, had a hand in Lost Planet.

Armature is doing the best they can, but I'm like, this doesn't look like remarkable in any way. When that trailer ran at E3, it was like, oh, this is what ReCore is like. I did not expect ReCore to look like this and this doesn't look good. This doesn't look like a AAA game and it doesn't look like an indie game. It looks like that THQ space where games got **** out.

The three, it's like it looks very amateurish. Like the game looks amateurish, like a, like a student project at times almost. There's like no enemy diversity. There's like Beck himself is like, like I look at it, I'm like, all right, sometimes you see Beck like art and I'm like, there's an interesting character in not ReCore is an interesting character.

I'm like, could you imagine me doing that to actual Mega Man? Well, we were talking about earlier, not just very briefly, when Mega Man 10 came out, I literally disappeared. When that game came out, I didn't play anything else for a month. I played that game over and over and over and over and over again. I loved it. It was like immaculately made. Same studio. So what I'm, what I'm saying is just, it's a cheap game. It's not a full-fledged, you know, I don't think $60 release. I get.

I was told by a friend of mine who reviewed the game for another outlet that it's easily, it's, there's a specific weapon in the game that totally breaks that system, which I didn't even realize. So there's, there's already broken mechanics in the game. The game's even out and people already figured out how to break it. And I just don't understand that. Even if that mechanic is sound and it is, it's fine. What about this as Mega Man? Like what about this? What you can go in any order and then use their, their weapons and like the, the boss weapons aren't even all that useful. And the game tells you basically what weapons you're supposed to use.

Mhm. And I'm like, part of the mystery was like figuring it out. What the **** happened here? Like, so you're basically just ruining that for me as well. Do you think it's because they try to dumb down the Mega Man formula for the mainstream? Maybe. I, I just, I just don't understand like where are the, where are the cool characters and like the design and like the attention to detail?

But I'm just telling you my impressions of like the meat of the game. And every Mega Man game, the meat of the game is not the castles, but getting through those stages. That's what's so fun about those games. Yeah, just expect drab characters, seeing the same enemies over and over again. These terrible .5D graphics, no design aesthetic at all, no design philosophy at all. Just okay, cool. Good, good use of an amateur team of like, not that Yacht Club Games are amateurs, but like they made other games. But those guys made a game that is exponentially better than Mighty No. 9.

But I mean, what does this mean for your, I guess, love of Inafune, right? Like it doesn't take away from what he's done, but you're talking about this, you're talking about ReCore. You're not talking positive things for him going. Let me use Harper Lee as an example. Sure. Okay. Yes. Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird. She wrote other essays and stuff like that, similar to Salinger. But she was really known for like this one thing. Obviously, just like Salinger was really known for this one thing.

But Harper Lee still wrote To Kill a Mockingbird, you know? Yeah. And so that's the, and I think it's a great way of putting it. Sure. Like Inafune still made Mega Man. He still produced Onimusha and Lost Planet and Dead Rising. I'm not trying. But he has fallen off. I mean, like, and frankly, and I love the man and he knows who I am. That's why I tweeted about this. Like, it's so weird that like, he knows me. Yeah. And so I say this with all, not that we're, I don't, we call us friends by any imagination.

I think you'll be lucky to get a seven from what I've seen of ReCore, you know? And then this game's like going to settle in the fives. Yeah. Soul Sacrifice settled in the sixes or sevens. It's like, okay, where is the Inafune that has the vision? Where's the Inafune that has the know-how? Do you think it's that him? It's him getting spread too thin. He's getting just his name is being attached to these projects and maybe he's not that in depth on them. That's what I think. I mean, that was my question with ReCore.

They're the ones making it. Sure. So I'm like, this is where I get really concerned for him because if he comes back again, they might be able to fund Mighty No. 9. Might just sell fine and like might make his money. And I mean, and honestly, the game, the money gain is already like probably profitable because he has a publisher and a Kickstarter.

I mean, you, he produced and helped with 9 and 10. But you made other games. You seemed like zombies and sci-fi and all this other ****. So just go in that direction. Just leave it alone. Like it's better that we don't get more Mega Man that sucks, which we've had plenty of, than Mighty No. 9, which didn't reach any of its full potential.

I know that those things are dying arts. I know that Inafune explained that it would have been way more expensive to make Bloodstained like that, just like it was in the Symphony of the Night style, for instance.

If you don't remember, ladies and gentlemen, in the last regular non-E3 edition of PS I Love You XOXO, our annual tradition continued of making predictions for what would happen at the PlayStation press conference. And our good friend Mitchell Morgan was there to document it all. So Mitchell Morgan writes in to go through the results with this. He says, E3 Predictions: Results. Hey guys, it's that time of year again, the time of year when Colin loses whatever shred of trust he still has in me again.

Quote, there will be a cave painting that will have the hippo, the giraffe, and the other thing. Greg said, now that Uncharted 4's dust has settled and we've all had time to explore Madagascar for ourselves, it's safe to say that no such reference was made. The wager, as was standard at the time, was one pizza. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Greg again. I app Greg before, but, but I'm reading Mitchell Morgan's thing now.

We're not joking when we say this place is ungodly expensive. Mitchell continues. Now to the important stuff. As a reminder, Colin was the winner of the last E3 prediction show. Of course I was. Now, shall we get into it? We should. We shall. Tim is up first. His prediction was that Final Fantasy XV will be a PS4 bundle and will be bundled with a Final Fantasy VII demo. Mitchell Morgan's results: A Final Fantasy XV bundle was not shown and we didn't hear a word about Final Fantasy VII or a demo. Zero points. Tim's next predic: Neo will be shown.

Mitchell Morgan's result, the controversial one. Here we go. Horizon was delayed to February 2017, but not at the conference. No date was ever discussed on stage, nor was an apology given by the devs, but a new gameplay trailer was shown. 33 points to Colin Moriarty. I'm going to dispute this, but not until I see how the rest of this shakes out. Go ahead. Colin's next prediction: PS4 Slim model will come out this summer and be $4, no, I'm sorry, $449.99.

Now this is true, and I want to, want to reiterate that in no fewer, I think, than three behind closed doors demos, uh, I was in.

They said it in Horizon, and I think they said it in Detroit, 'cause people and my people asked, is this right? They all said that the games are running on regular PS4. And Shuhei Yoshida did say, and I was told that none, none of that was running, nothing was running on Neo there. Sure. So we have to take that word for it. We do.

I think that I should get a full point there, but it's no big deal because I put the maybe. But anyways, uh, my next prediction was, Ed Boon gives an Injustice 2 demo. PlayStation owners get an exclusive character, Guy Gardner. Mitchell Morgan reports, no Injustice at this year's show, but we got some Spider-Man from Insomniac, which was nice too. Zero points.

Broken clocks right twice a day. Greg, here you go. I don't know where we were in your ****. I **** it up. Sorry. It's fine. It doesn't matter. Uh, before we jump out of, I thought there was a question that actually is interesting pertaining to some of this and what we've been talking about. It's an E3 related question. It involves a good friend of ours, Hoopie91. Hoopie from KindaFunny.com/psq, where you can go to get your question read. He says, Hi Colin and Greg.

You can't come out there and talk at length for 30 minutes about every game that comes out. But behind closed doors, you can. You can go in there. You can have journalists get a chance to ask questions. You can have them report back on the information they see.

They'll talk about maybe if they're on target for a 2017 release date or not. It's the stuff you wouldn't get out of a press conference. The idea is that there's no easy way for you to go out there, ask your questions. So again, we're standing in when we go out there to talk to people for you and get nitty-gritty with games.

Mr. Brian, who goes by the name NeoGryFoxH on KindaFunny.com/psq, where you can submit your question, says, Hey Greg and Colin. My question is related specifically to the Spider-Man PS4 announcement. Prior to the announcement, Colin expressed hesitation to get excited about a Sucker Punch Spider-Man game, mostly because he wants to see Sucker Punch do their own thing and not be weighed down by an already existing IP. Now that we know Insomniac is doing Spider-Man, Colin, do you still share these sentiments?

Thanks for your hard work. I really, really, really, really, really, really, really like you. Sincerely, Mr. Brian. Mr. Brian, uh, yeah, I feel totally differently. First of all, Sucker Punch has one team. I mean, they might have two teams now, but they always really made games as one team. So I didn't want their only team or the only output of the studio to be a Spider-Man game. I think that would have been a huge mistake and a huge misuse of resources. And I think Sony would agree. Insomniac isn't owned by Sony, so I don't really care, you know, from the first-party perspective what they're doing. But, uh, they have like five teams. And, uh, by the way, the leadership of",

He was one of the creative directors on Sunset Overdrive. And our friend Marcus Smith, who's the other creative director from Resistance and from Sunset Overdrive, um, is not working on that game either. He's working on a VR game. So you imagine the team, though. So some of the team is there, but I'm saying the dynamic at the top. I mean, when I, when that game was announced, when we really heard about that game actually, because we heard about the game long before it was announced, um, and we knew that Insomniac was working on it, um, that was my assumption.

People are mad that it's PlayStation 4 exclusive, but I think it makes sense within that Sony ecosystem that's starting to work better together, a little more symbiotic relationship between the movies and all this kind of stuff. So even, no, so I, I feel totally different now that I'm actually relieved. When I heard that Insomniac was making that game and not Sucker Punch before E3, I was totally relieved. I still love to see Sucker Punch. I don't think it would have been a mistake.

And I think that's why I'm so excited about this, about whatever Marvel's doing with Telltale, about whatever is going on behind closed doors when Marvel talks about video games. I, I've said this a few times, but when we went to see Age of Ultron, that was when Marvel debuted their new strategy for doing video games. They introduced their new video game team and it was, we're not making them internally, we're not partnering with one publisher, we're not doing what we did before, which would have been, yes, Activision, all right, give it to Beenox and give them nine months to turn around a Spider-Man game. It would have been mediocre and it would have been garbage. And I think you, when you look at this, they are",

And I think you, when you look at this, they are looking at what DC Warner Bros. has done with Batman, where if you remember, there could have easily been a Dark Knight video game. They canceled one. The story goes that it was, it was so bad that they canceled it rather than try to time it with the movie and instead said, Rocksteady, take your time. Batman will matter when Batman comes out. And that's exactly what happened. They let Rocksteady work on their own path. It wasn't trying to tie into a movie, it wasn't trying to be another throwaway superhero game. I think that you will not, I do not think you're going to see Spider-Man next year, even based on, as far as I understand, you're not going to see Spider-Man next year. That's as far as I understand.

This was another announcement of, hey, we're doing something really cool and something unexpected. And it's exciting for PlayStation fans, but I think it's more exciting for comic book fans of seeing Marvel finally go like, let's take a breath and let's take this seriously. Let's get on the level of making a Batman. Let's make our characters matter. And then it gets exciting to see what are they doing with Iron Man, Captain America, Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy?

Colin, after abandoning us like a bunch of traitors. Yeah, now he, our tail between their legs.

I don't see anyone talking about it.

Now, when we heard about this game a long time ago, multiple, you know, over the years, basically, we heard the name and we, we heard that it was a motorcycle game, like a game about motorcycles. And we heard gangs, like gangs. And we heard that it was a zombie game. I mean, those were, and it was open world. That was basically all we knew. And we got all those things. I think now, I, as I said in our video about Days Gone, and as we, and as I think people were talking about, I think there's a bit of a marketing challenge here, not only because of the saturation of the zombies, which I think even Bend admitted.

The last had their own interesting take on it. Um, and I actually think this takes even more interesting. And the reason, but it's a way for them to market it in, in, in an effective way as more than a showcase of tech, a technical showcase, which the game is.
