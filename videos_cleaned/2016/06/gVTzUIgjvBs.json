            "text": "Greetings and salutations, welcome to a Kinda Funny let's play. I feel like I haven't done one of these in a while here on Kinda Funny Games. Today I want to show you a little game called Downwell. This is an indie game, or I should say an indie game out of Japan, um, and it's been on PC for a little while, I think, but it recently came to PS4 and Vita. I've been playing it on Vita. This is my first time playing on PS4 here. I'm playing on our 20th anniversary PS4. Um, I just wanted to show it to you guys because I'm actually really enjoying it. The game is really simple by design, um, but really hard to master. I'm not great at it, um, but the idea basically is that you fall down, um, a well, and you're just so like, think of it as a almost like a, that was a bad start, almost like a, uh, vertical side scroller, and the idea is to just get as low as possible, um, and you use these boots, these gun boots, by pressing the X button, um, to fire at enemies and obstacles. So like you can, and you also use it to jump, but if",

So like you can, and you also use it to jump, but if you use it again, you can basically fire. On the right side is like a little bar, um, and I have a laser gun right now, so I only have three bullets. You reload when you land. So the game is pretty formulaic by in that, in that respect, um, but super, super difficult to master and get really far in. Um, in the few hours I've played on Vita, I've gotten maybe halfway through the game. I'm not very good at it, um, mostly because, uh, I think it's actually an authentically difficult kind of experience, and that's kind of what I dig about it. Um, you can see in the upper right corner, I'm sorry, upper left corner is your health, um, upper right corner are the gems you're collecting. That's currency, um, that you're going to be using in the game, and I'll show you when we reach stores, and there's a little side, uh, rooms like",

That turtle is impervious to my attacks. Some enemies can be landed on like that enemy and just killed. Others can't be unless you have better momentum. Birds like that will just follow you down, so you want to kill them when you see them. So basically we're going, we're going, we're going. Things are a little easy to go in the beginning here. We'll kill this bird and we'll go through this, and we're through the first little portion, um, so one one's cleared. Now at the end of every little stage you beat, you get an option of three randomly generated items that you can get. So here we have popping gems, so getting gems causes a bullet to shoot up, so this will cause like",

This one says longer state of invincibility when damage taken, and this one says creates time void when damage. So none of these choices to me are are exceptionally good. I'm going to go with the candle, and then we'll keep on proceeding. I have 300 gems right now. I'm in the second Cavern, so we're going, we're going. The cool thing about this, and we'll see when I eventually do lose all my lives, which will happen probably not long from now, um, is you get, I just got hit there, you get options to get like new color palettes. I actually been playing with like this blue kind of azure color palette, which is kind of neat, um, but this red one is kind of the standard one that the game starts with, and you can see as you leave more enemies behind, they'll actually",

Um, here's a shop, so here's where you can use your currency. So since I'm down at 304, I can use a rice ball. I can, I can buy a battery for another charge. I can buy sushi, which would heal two, um, because I'm dying. Uh, I typically wouldn't spend the currency like this, but I'm going to do it to just show you what it's all about. Um, I'm going to buy a rice ball here, and now I have three of four energy, um, but I'm down to 78 gems, and now I need to get out of here and continue to go. So the cool thing about this game, and what I really like about it, is is its accessibility. Um, not every game has to be like this hardcore kind of like adventure, um, for the most hardcore gamers. It reminds me a little bit of Hitman GO in that sense, not in terms of the way the game's played, but, um, in",

It reminds me a little bit of Hitman GO in that sense, not in terms of the way the game's played, but, um, in terms of the fact it's accessibility. Right before Kinda Funny Live, to my mom and her husband came here, and I introduced them to some games. We were playing this, that, and the other thing. I was showing them Uncharted 4, this, that, and the other, and then I was like, you know, I think you might like this game called Hitman GO. Um, and I showed them this game, and because that game was so simple to understand, these two people that didn't play games actually got sucked in for several hours playing the game, arguing kind of comically over the puzzles and over the solutions to the puzzles and stuff. So when there's a game that's easy to understand and wrap your head around, it could be a good gateway drug to more hardcore games, which I found. So we beat the second Cavern. We have some more options here, so consume",

Members card, I can, uh, shops, I'll get a shop at the start of the stage and a 10% discount at those shops, um, and the laser sight increases range and increases accuracy. I'm going to go with the Knife and Fork, and you can see at the bottom left corner of the screen is where like the collection of things that I've found so far are. So what I found here is that this game kind of tempts me to rush, and that's my own fault. Um, you really can take your time. There's nothing telling me that I have to go fast. It's a, I feel like it's a little more elegant when you go fast, fast, um, but there's nothing telling me that I have to. So you can really like kind of take your time and be meticulous if you want, and there's nothing",

So you can really like kind of take your time and be meticulous if you want, and there's nothing obviously wrong with that at all. And this is kind of the way I'm playing now, 'cause the game definitely ramps, um, pretty significantly. And what's really cool, and I think what's kind of neat about the design of the game, is the inability to reload unless you land, which I think is kind of a cool little touch. Like you really have to play that into, you know, into, uh, and factor that into your your play through. So let's see, we're back in another store here, so I can get another rice ball and get a car battery, get curry. I'll heal myself again, and then we'll get out of here. So this bird, because I left him alive before, is chasing me. So see if I can get him. There we go. So I can just kind of get rid of. I eat the body for health if I want. This turtle is impervious to attacks like that, but he's over some gems I",

This turtle is impervious to attacks like that, but he's over some gems I would have wanted to get, but I missed them. So let's kill this bird, kill this guy. Here's another little quarter we can go into. There's some more gems here. We can get lots of them. Nice little nice little stack of gems there. Oh, I just got hit. That was bad. Let's kill that guy. So here, so you can see here, the solidly colored enemies typically, um, are ones that are impervious to attack from jumping on them. So like that red slug snail kind of character creature on the left wall, um, I wouldn't really need to use my laser on him, but for these white enemies, um, and that red guy right there is another example, but that bird, for instance, I could land on him if there was a clear path for there isn't. Go in here. So I'm going to get another weapon here. So these give me like bullets. So you can see I now have 10",

So you can see I now have 10 uh ammo instead of three, but this weapon is not nearly as strong, um, but I kind of like this kind of weapon better. And everything freezes when you're in this little dome around the door, which is kind of cool. So you can kind of assess where you're at when you get out. So you can really use it to your advantage. Oh, bad. And I fall right through, and we're out of the second or third Cavern, rather. So here I have some more options. Getting gems recharges gun boots. So theoretically, if I just keep collecting gems, I could stay in the air and keep firing without losing ammo. Um, gunpowder blocks will block, uh, uh, blocks will shoot out bullets when destroyed. That's super useful to me. That will create a bunch of shrapnel on the stage that will help destroy enemies around me. These ghosts take quite a bit",

I remember I got that little power before, so that's quite useful. Let's get in here. See what this guy's going to sell. So see now the price of things are going up, um, as I buy them. I think they'll go up and as you get further in the game. So now the rice ball that cost 300 gems now cost 500, and I actually don't have enough to even buy it, um, which is why you might want to save for when you really need things later. But that's the kind of opportunity cost of the game, um, which is I think what makes it so fun. So things are getting super chaotic here. I'm dying. I only have one health left. I don't know how much further I'm going to get. We'll have to",

I don't know how much further I'm going to get. We'll have to see. I mean, I'm I'm working my way down, playing playing kind of passively. I've seen, uh, or heard that people play this game quite elegantly, quite quickly. Ah, I'm dead. So I got, you know, decently far, not very far. Level 1 collected about 1,160 gems. Now this is what I was talking about before. You unlock palettes, um, as you play the game that will allow you to get different kind of colors, um, and you can see like a little progress bar here that refills with the gems you collect overall. Um, it will also count your kills and your max combo and the time you played. So we only played for a little under six minutes there, which is a pretty average time to play the game early on unless you're moving through really fast, um, which I wasn't. Uh, so yeah, the progress bars are kind of a cool little underlying theme.",

Uh, so yeah, the progress bars are kind of a cool little underlying theme, like a little role playing game kind of unlockable thing where you unlock, you know, you don't really unlock much of any use, um, but I'll show you, um, actually those are the styles. That's not what we want. Let me collect that. We're beginning the game again, but let me go to the palette and I'll show you. So Matcha is green, so we can play a green. So let's play through in green and see if we can play any better this time around, or by we, I mean me. Oh, jeez, not a good start. So for people that are wondering how it's controlled, you're basically using the D-pad left and right, or you can use the analog stick, but this a game like this obviously is designed for the D-pad, um, and you're basically just using the X button to jump and to fire. So again, very simple, very straightforward. So we're moving down. Oh, God, not",

So we're moving down. Oh, God, not having a good go of it here. I missed that little corridor too. Not good so far. Let's see if I can clean it up a little bit. These birds are everywhere. So I, you could see that I killed that turtle there before. I told you before that the turtles were impervious to attack. You basically need to have momentum to kill them. Like they're shelled. So you're need a little, all right, so we have options here. Um, what do we want? Let's create a time void. One more damage. It'll slow things down for us, I think. So the cool thing about this game is it's obviously very roguelike, um, which is, you know, all the, what, I don't know how much of a fad it is now, but it was a fad for a long time, um, and I like the elements. I like the roguelike elements, similar to Binding of Isaac in a way where you don't really know what",

I like the roguelike elements, similar to Binding of Isaac in a way where you don't really know what you're going to get, and you can get different permutations of things. Therefore, it helps you in different ways, um, and I really like that kind of element to a game. Not in every game, not every game needs that kind of element. I like a a level of predictability in some of the games I play, or in many of the games I play, but in games like this, it's cool because you're playing it over and over again, and you can't use the same strategies because the game really won't let you. So you're going to get like different drops basically, and I think that's that's kind of a neat little aspect of of Downwell. So we have a different weapon now. We have a stronger weapon, it looks like. Um, we can get out of the time void here and continue to fly because I left that bird alive before. He's going to continue to chase",

I only have one health left. Not looking good. So we can get the laser sight. Getting gems recharges gun boots. So we've seen all these before. Um, let's increase range and increase accuracy using the laser sight. And again, they're collected in the bottom left corner, so you can see. So this adds like a little laser sight to let me know what I'm aiming at, which is kind of neat, but I'm probably going to die soon. So we'll start again. Yep, there we go. So let's do, let's try to do, you know, we've been growing a little bit. Let's try to do one more play through. I want to kind of just introduce you to a little bit more of the game. Um, I'm going to go back to",

Um, I'm going to go back to the surface because I just love this little screen, by the way. This is pretty cool. I like how the game begins. Jump down the well, select your style, and you go. And obviously, as you can see, the caverns are also randomly generated, so there's no predictability in the game other than the way the game plays, which I think is pretty cool. I can't believe I already been damaged again. Not showing this off very well. Oh, falling very far. So the idea here is you can move through the game pretty quickly. You just don't know what you're going to run into. Um, so there's like an opportunity cost there as well. I mean, and that's not much of an opportunity. I mean, moving quickly doesn't seem to have any benefit at all. Um, so I don't really know why you'd want to play like that, but oddly, like when I first started playing",

My instincts were to just move quickly. Um, I just felt like I wanted to, I felt like I, I felt like I was in less danger the more, the more quickly I moved, um, but even though I'm not very good at the game, I'm really having a great time with it. Um, it's just cool. There's a little draw there. It really does remind me of Binding of Isaac again in the sense that you just want to see what's next. You want to get a little further, a little further. So I can get an Apple. I can gain 4 HP, which really sucks in. Yeah, it's unfortunately the the jetpack would have been nice, but I'm running out of energy here, so that's actually very fortuitous to kind of drop the apple, and you can see that I got an apple, but now it's only a little core",

So let's kill this frog and begin. So the little gems are worth two, in case you haven't noticed. The big ones are worth 10. So those are the the denominations basically. So I'm not sure you can ever have an odd number of gems, but I could be wrong on that. Let's see what's in here. We have a new weapon, 10 bullets. Remember again, to reload, you have to land. Gee, I got damaged there because again, I landed on a solidly colored enemy. Those are not meant to be landed on. You have to shoot them or just ignore them, as I described before, but ignored my own advice. So hopefully we can find some health in here. No, but we do have a bunch of gems, which will be useful for us. We can buy things at the store, and we continue to move on, and we're at the bottom. So we're out of this Cavern as well.

That'll be useful for us, so we don't have to physically go capture them. It'll make us a little richer. Oh, but I probably won't live long enough to enjoy it. Oh, God, I almost, I almost tried to jump on him like a ****, but I got out of there just in a nick of time. All right, let's see what's in here. Hopefully some health. Nope, but another gun. So shotgun. So again, only three bullets, but sprays powerful shots. Will be useful for us. A shop here. Let's go buy health. Just short of being able to buy two for the sushi, but the rice ball is one, and at least this will give us a little more, um, leeway as we move through, and we'll use the time stop for now.

Oh, just got damaged again, um, as it was being developed and and, uh, came to other platforms. So, um, you know, obviously a game, not a game till it's on Vita. So this is where we enjoy it. So we're done with the third Cavern. Let's see what we have here. Gem High lasts for a longer duration. Jetpack for use when out of charge. Shoot a gun module to reshuffle it once. We'll go with the jetpack. So now we're in the Catacombs, which is the next set of three. We'll kind of take our time here if we can. As soon as I say that, I'm sure I'm going to die.

Um, so we'll just retry and start from the beginning, and then I'll just go here and palette. And so this is what the game looks like with the Aqua, and this is actually how I play on Vita, even though I've unlocked more than this. Um, I like this look a lot. I think it's really pretty. I'm a big fan of the color blue anyway. I hope you enjoyed the let's play. This is Downwell, uh, available now on, uh, platforms that would be interesting to our audience, PC possibly, but probably more likely PS4 and Vita. Um, enjoy it there. Have fun.
