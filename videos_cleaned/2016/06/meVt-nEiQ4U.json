We're excited to be able to show you this preview of South Park: The Fractured But Whole, brought to you by Ubisoft and Amazon. What's up guys, I'm Tim Gettys, this is Greg Miller. Here we are again, Ubisoft booth E3 2016, doing it the Kinda Funny way. What did we just see, Greg? South Park: The Fractured But Whole. It's right behind me, behind me. Oh, nice. Okay, good, that works out well. Uh, saw, uh, I was a huge fan of Stick of Truth. Again, this is a video sponsored by Ubisoft, so if in your heart you don't want to believe me, that's totally fine. This is just what I wanted out of this sequel. I love Stick of Truth, you know, I played it like a crazy person, would have got the Platinum, but I missed one shiny Pok\u00e9mon. I didn't want to go back for it. Um, the fact that they're moving away from the fantasy element, doing a superhero game, is like exactly what I want, speaking to us, no big deal, don't worry. The fact that it's a superhero",

The fact that it's a superhero is exactly what I want. The whole meta thing of them trying to build it only for universe is great. The way the jabs they're making, the way they're inspired their characters, the fact that Timmy is Professor X is, oh my God, it's so funny. I mean, that's the thing, this game is funny. This game is so funny, funnier even than I think South Park can be sometimes, you know, this **** lady. So South Park, obviously, one of the most clever, witty shows of all time, of course. But watching this, like even this, the E3 demo we played, there was jokes about it being an E3 demo, just like they're saying that it's interactive comedy, and I'm like, I, I love it. I love that every single thing that's happening, there's a moment where, uh, the characters were fighting, ding, the Civil War thing, and they were in the middle of the",

I love that every single thing that's happening, there's a moment where, uh, the characters were fighting, ding, the Civil War thing, and they were in the middle of the street, and they had to stop in the middle of the battle to go on the sidewalk. They're like, car, and the car comes by, yell, they go back in the totally character, exactly. Awesome. It's exactly what you, if you played Stick of Truth, and you should have, and if you haven't, go play it now. The fact that it's all that humor, it is the South Park, it's them playing with each other and falling down dead. What I was really impressed with was the combat, because of course, Stick of Truth's combat was fun, but it was simple, and after a while you got the hang of it. This one of positioning the characters and moving them around, I didn't know how that was going to work. I didn't know if it was going to be like Valkyria, where I had a, you know, a set meter, how many movements I could go. You can move them around as long as you",

You can move them around as long as you want, try to figure out where the best point to attack is, try to set it up so that when you use the next character, 'cause that's a big thing of them having the characters in a row, seeing who's going to play. And there's a lot of like being able to hit the character and bounce them away and move the spaces they're in. So it really is, it's kind of like a grid, and it's about using the grid just as much as it is about fighting the enemy. It's pretty cool. Yeah, it's strategic, and that's something that was missing from before. In terms, speaking of strategic things, there's a new thing called Total Ass Control. Uh, when you go to the bathroom, you can use the, the analog sticks, definitely their biggest thing they got going. You can control your sphincter. Yeah, when you fart, you can control the, the, the pitch and the, the",

I'm just giving you our time. It's okay. No, I love you, don't worry about it. I appreciated the late effort. No, uh, yeah, that was cool. But the big one was Fartkour, which is like, so it's pretty much using, using your, have you seen South Park? Nothing, don't worry. It's using your, your farting ability to kind of like traverse and get around. So it's like you can use the farts to like boost up and stuff. Well, the thing about it was, it's like a team-up move, and that's something that, you know, was always so funny that Marvel Ultimate Alliance made a big deal about that back in the day. It's now the fact that like to get to the high-end, like we're in Downtown South Park, if you remember before, there'd be treasure",

Now, as you get people into your party and you become friends with everybody again and you build out your team of heroes, uh, you know, he was friends with Human Kite, uh, Stan, or no, Kyle. So they don't have hats, so it's weird to try to keep track at all. Kyle, uh, Kyle was able to come in, then grab him, and he basically grabs you and your farts propel you and you parkour jump the way up there. Yeah, it was good, it was cute, definitely cool. And I, I, I like that they were saying that so there's the 10 different classes of superheroes that you can choose, and uh, when you choose one of them, not all of them were unlocked from the beginning to play the game to get them all, but later you can even combine the classes. Yep, you can combine the",

Yep, you can combine the classes, so you can make a Cyborg Ninja or whatever the hell they were talking about. But I like too that like when you change it, you get to see that backstory. Of course, the E3 demo showed the backstory of, you know, you're the Speedster because, uh, your dad screwed your mom. But now when you change them out, you can see what made that, that kind of hero, that kind of hero. Yeah, dude, the, so the demo kind of elaborated and was a little bit longer than the, the press conference thing that we saw where, um, after the whole, the, the backstory thing, there was like a battle scene before he finds out that his dad screwed up. And uh, I, I thought it was cool. It's really, it's really funny. I like, I like that it's funny.

Cartman's house is the same, his closet still has all the same gimmicks in it and stuff. I like that this is directly the day after you, like, you like Stick of Truth, here's more. Uh-huh. I also really like that the humor is very on the nose and tailored towards us and our comic book, you know, interest and stuff. And I like that they're, they're going all in with it. It's, they're not like making illusions and stuff, they're saying straight up, this character is like the Flash, this character is like Speedster. This, like, they're naming the characters, they're not just like, oh, it's a fast guy. I think that that's really cool, really, really cool. I love that the trash talk to DC and Marvel, really fun.",

Uh, it ran, it's running great, which is always a big problem with Stick of Truth, and that had those hitches, it had that thing. So many people just want to get their heads beat in by Greg Miller right now. No, no, it was good. Yeah, and I, yeah, I'm excited for it, and I'd say it even if they weren't paying us. Yeah, they're only paying us to say Ubisoft sponsored the video, they're not paying us to say we like order on Amazon. That's the whole thing too. You'll hear that in a second.
