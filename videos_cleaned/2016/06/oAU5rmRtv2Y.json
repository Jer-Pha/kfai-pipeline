What's up everybody? Welcome to another Kinda Funny Games Let's Play. It's me, Nick Scarpino, and I'm playing LawBreakers right now, and this is going to be ridiculous. So let's just see how it goes. All right, I'm going to pick the uh, I'm going to pick the Enforcer, 'cause natch, the guy that's 5'8\" should be the Enforcer. Confirming. Jump into this combat. 5, God, 4, 3, 1. Of course, first and foremost, I got it. Z win. Can I invert my control? Oh **** yeah, I got a mouse invert. Sorry guys, every time. Let's, I'm old school that way. Always, always a pain in the ass. Thank you so much. Right, two, one, here we go. Whoa, too bad you to die. Oh God, oh God, this, oh hey, look, our Smiley. So right off the bat, this is a little bit weird. I'm kind of floating around in this gravity bubble, but I'm going to beat gravity in submission as hard as humanly",

It's been a while since I played around with mouse and keyboard, but it comes right back to you. Come on, we got it, we got it, we got this. Come on guys, I'm going to be, I'm going to try to be MVP. Right shift makes you run. God son of a ****. All right, let me just play around with these abilities. Okay, that's that ability. You like the smell of napalm? I love the smell of napalm. Thank you for asking. Match tied. Good job guys, you're really holding down the fort. You 3, 1 contested. This is ****. Shoot. The world is a better place without you. C. Just another day at the office, that's what I always like to say. All right, oh son of a **** lead. Yeah boy, you're welcome everybody. Jesus Christ. 3, 1 shut out. You lost the lead.

Son of a **** must pay. I gotta be honest, not my best showing. Mine either. Yeah, I don't think, I think I've killed one person, uh, and I think that was by like a, like a mercy kill, like by accident. A lot better now. I'm, yeah, I'm still not quite understanding the special features or the special functions. Son of a, yeah. All right, I'm going to get him on the next round. I'm not giving up. I want to be the best LawBreaker, or actually on this point, Law Enforcer, humanly possible. See, I should have picked, the problem is I'm not, I'm not the law. I should have picked the LawBreakers because that's much more my forte, or my fort, you want to say grammatically correct. Nope. All right, always catches up with you. Okay, all right, what's up now?

This is so, this is like taking my ego and destroying it right now. This is why I don't play online, 'cause it tells me how terrible I am. Everywhere is a war zone. Oh look, I figured out how to aim it. Enemy is three zones away from winning. That's right. Just get started. You died defending. I got 10 seconds. 10 seconds. I'm just going to run around and look good. Here we go. Going to try to look up. 3, 1 from winning. You got to watch your back, these sneaky mother. This experience is very enlightening for me. Crime, you're going to pay today. Three. All right, yeah, get my back. One there. Get my back, dog. You lose. Well, we lost, but it was not for lack of trying, that's for sure. I feel",

Gravity, we did what we could, but we did not succeed in beating gravity into submission, and that is unfortunate. I think we have, are we, are we doing one more mode maybe? Am I? Oh, it's a rematch. Okay, so we have one more opportunity to succeed. I'm going to take it. I feel like I learned a lot that first round, and I can just push into this round. Namely, I'm going to, I'm just going to camp. I think I'm just going to sit in a corner and try to pick people off. It worked for Greg Miller, it's going to work for me. Let's do it. Can switch classes see when you're dead. Oh, let's, oh, you can. I'm going to change it up a little bit. The, the Enforcer, not my style. Is way too tall. N.I. confirming.

Okay, well, should have picked a ranged fighter. I'm going to change classes now. I'm going to go over the uh, let's go to the Titan and see how that works for us. When I feel like, oh, hello old friend. They call this weapon the sun ****. Who wants some of the sun **** to win? Oh, oh, Hulk smash. All right, so I don't feel like I've quite mastered gravity yet. Admit it. I think I just killed someone, killed like a bunch of people. Great. Nailed it, found my class. Everybody, I'm starting to fit in, and I feel good about this.

You got to really lead a lot with this weapon. God son of a ****. Death from Above. I'm not stressed, just I feel like I'm not bringing it, and I feel like I'm letting my teammates down right now. That's all I'm saying. Let's go, let's go take it everybody. You have gained the lead. Yeah boy, you're all welcome. Okay, combat operations in progress. 3, 1. Look like son of a ****. How do you get all way up there? I'm going to get, you know what I'm going to do? I'm thinking horizontally. I'm going to think more vertically right now. It's going to give me the lead.

I zagged when I should have zigged, or maybe I zigged when I should have zagged. Maybe that's my problem. I don't know the difference. Got me out. What's up? Who wants some of that sun ****? You like to smell of napalm? I do like to smell of napalm. Whoa, whoa, get freak nasty with these. That match tied. It's over. Go. I heard, I heard her slice through my liver first before anything else happened. You don't need a liver, right? You don't need livers, right? No, pancreas takes care of everything. Oh, Rocket Scott, how's my hair looking? Is it looking good? On point. One Brad Pitt. I have the Brad Pitt here. No. Okay, well, that just stunk my confidence. God son of a ****.

Did we just win? Love you all. Good stuff. See you. I see you. 1 mama coming through. Oh, look what I can do. Double kill. Again. Right through the nutsack. That one, that hurt. I felt that. Not here. Not so much here. Enemy is zero away from winning. This is ****. All right. Walking. 3, 1. Oh damn it. There you go. Zone captured. Enemy is two zones away from winning. Good sh*t. No, just got my head canoed. I don't need that. Blind Melon. Two. Bullsh*t. Let's go. We going B? Where are we going? Go back to A. We're going back to A. Two zones to win.

We're capturing zones, we're losing zones. I don't know what's happening. I'm floating in a gravity bubble trying to wrestle it or her into submission. It's not working. You have no respect. God damn it. Well, Darkness, I see you, Darkness. We lost. We could have won if I tried harder, but let's be honest, 50% all I can muster on day two of E3. Uh, thank you so much guys for watching this. Hopefully you enjoyed it. Hopefully you gleaned a little bit of how you can wrestle gravity in submission, or beat gravity in submission, or just maybe woo gravity in submission. Maybe would like some chocolate and some flow.
