What's up everybody? We're live at E3 2016 on the GameSpot Co-Op stage. How are you audience? Woo! This one guy with the camera refuses to clap. That guy just did this. I don't think that was helpful to the clap. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller from Kinda Funny, alongside Tim Gettys from Kinda Funny, and ladies and gentlemen, Murs! Very exciting. Stop there. We go. Strange Music. Yes! Holy ****! Wow! I can't believe we're sitting here hanging out. Murs all day. Murs, the story with you goes like this in me, our story. You, you don't know it as well as I know it. I'm sorry. So we were down at MomoCon in Atlanta. I saw, 'Oh, Tech's got a show.' I love Tech N9ne, of course. I'm going to go see a Tech N9ne show. We walked in and then Tim over here saw the Murs poster and he goes, 'Oh ****! Murs is part of Strange Music now!' And I was like, 'I don't know'",

I was like, 'This guy's amazing!' I kept telling Tim, 'I've been a big fan, Tim. My, my one of my favorite shirts growing up was the 'Murs is better than your favorite rapper'.' It's very true to this day. It's true. Not as good as this shirt with Donkey Kong. It's not, you know, I've grown a little bit. But dude, love your music, love your stuff. Thank you. Is this your first E3? Yeah, no, it was since it's been close to the public. Yeah, okay, cool, awesome. Yeah, yeah, so it was for us. We did it and then Tim said, 'Oh, we need to get you on the show.

Yeah, I was like, 'Oh, he likes video games. This is easy as hell.' Now we still haven't talked though. I need, but now we are. You're here now. This doesn't count. You still have to come to San Francisco. You got to come on GameOverGreggy Show. We'll put you up. We'll treat you nice. Oh, really? Five star? Oh, yeah. The W's three star. We'll give you three star. Three stars, all three star hotels. So Murs, for somebody who doesn't know you, right? How do you describe yourself in a nutshell?

They love it, right? They love it. It's your first time out of the gate. It's hard to be shameless with your self-promotion like me with twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames again or KindaFunny.com for short. You do that. You do it. Um, man, can we play together something sometime? Yes. I'm not a huge multiplayer fan. Have you been playing Overwatch? You, I did a 4-hour stream, my first 4-hour stream. I'm, I'm there. I'm all about it. He likes it. I recently started getting into it. Holy ****! That game is fun. What do you play? I play Winston all day too. I, I've been with a Widowmaker.

Yeah, team and Murs, we get in there. I'll get in there. I'll play some. Yeah, what are, what are you playing on? Um, PC? Are you guys a console guys? I never knew you were a huge dork, Murs, playing on your PC. Uh, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm real. Man, how many platinum trophies you got? Platinum trophies? Yeah, you finished that Persona 4 Golden on Vita yet? No, goddammit. Why you laughing my face about it, Murs? God dang it. So, so what comes first for you? Is it video games or rapping or music? Rapping for sure. I'm new, I'm new to video. I played video games when I was younger. Then I got a rap career and when you tour with rappers, they only want to play Madden or NBA 2K.

So it brings the fun back. So I play with Overwatch with all my subscribers and we have a great time. I do a 4-hour stream. I get to play with all the people in New Zealand or whatever, fans from Germany. So it was super cool and it made me love gaming again because I'm with people who actually play cool games. We played The Walking Dead Telltale series. Like we play cool ****. We don't play, not the sports games aren't cool, but if I was that into sports, I'd just play them for real and I don't want to do that. No, no, nobody wants to do that. None of us.

Because what I loved about Have a Nice Life is that there's a couple songs in there that do reference games, you know, call out Sega Genesis here or there. So I, yeah, when I'm playing now, when I play a game like for Telltale, um, I did a RIP poem. I do poems. No, you didn't. Yeah, I did a RIP poem. I did a poem called, um, 'Dark Souls 3 is difficult as ****.' Like because I couldn't, I couldn't beat it. So I played till I died 316 times. Oh, yeah. So it took me about 10 days of playing it and I sucked and, and it was very frustrating and then I raged, I staged the rage quit at the end. I smashed my controller and smashed everything.

That's awesome. Except for Jet Grind Radio and all the old school Grind Radio. There you go. There you go. Then for you, when you're writing music, does it start as a poem or is it always, is it different for you? Yeah, I start with a beat and then I just didn't want to rap on Twitch. I wanted to do something different and it's hard to play the beat and get clearance and I don't want to get my VOD muted and all this ****. So I said, 'I'll just do spoken word and speak from the heart because that's my, you know, video games are in my heart.' I love you, Murs. I love you so much, Murs.
