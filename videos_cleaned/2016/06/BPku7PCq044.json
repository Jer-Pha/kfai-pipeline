What's up, guys? I'm Tim Gettys. This is the goddamn beautiful Greg Miller. Hi, this is all your E3 2016 Kinda Funny coverage. Right now, we're taking a look at South Park: The Fractured But Whole. Get it? Like butthole. Yeah, interesting name. Like, I feel like that's, you know, out of all the puns they could have made, I feel like they really stretched out there for this one. You think so? Yeah, why? I don't know, it's just like I would have never thought Fractured But Whole, you know? But it's, it makes sense, 'cause now they've explained it to Civil War story. Yeah, so they, they're bringing it all in. Yeah, superhero themed. Yes, thank God. Last time, Stick of Truth, we had that fantasy shit, Orcs and all elves and shit. Yeah, great game. Kenny looking like Zelda. Yeah, yeah, but now, bam, right up our alley, Greg, superheroes. That's why we're doing",

Yeah, yeah, but now, bam, right up our alley, Greg, superheroes. That's why we're doing this one together. Bam, 'cause you know Colin likes the South Park game. He doesn't like superheroes like we like superheroes. And that's why there's so many great jokes in this one already, making fun of Marvel, they're making fun of DC already. I said this earlier, Greg, this trailer, my favorite trailer thus far of E3. We still have the Sony press conference to to blow my mind with some Crash Bandicoot, but this right here, love it. I love them looking at the plan, trying to figure out how they're going to do their whole the motion picture Universe, and they're talking all the shit and it's like, man, they're so funny. South Park, funny shit. Yeah, I mean, outside of just it being funny, it was a great demo at E3 as well, right? Showing how they have revamped the system. It looks better, it runs better here of",

It looks better, it runs better. Here, of course, is that, you know, you know, before it was just very simple combat because they were saying simple fantasy stuff. For this, it is, you can go behind cover, you get a little bit of a grid thing. Colin described a little bit like Final Fantasy Tactics, clearly light, but that's interesting. Uh, the ability that if you hit your guy back into another guy, one of your people, they can do additional damage and kick it out that way. You're going to be moving people around rather than just have waves of people crashing into each other. Yeah, I mean, going back to the graphics, this game, it's so impressive. Yeah, like it look, as always, looks like the the show, you know, which is such a testament to like where graphics are at these days, but also the art style of South Park being such a a thing that people know, but it",

Um, of course, you got to love the the politically correct over here because they, you know, they topical, very topic, very, very topical. Biggest surprise, yeah, December 6th this year. I know, it's incredibly, incredibly exciting. And also, if you pre-order, you get Stick of Truth on the current gen consoles. Yeah, finally get it there. Uh, that's what you want. Of course, you want you, 'cause we've been asking for it forever. Today, right before the Ubisoft press conference, the trophies leaked for the PlayStation 4 version, which was like, yes, it's happening. We can't wait. So yeah, super exciting as that's there. Uh, actually, probably when we get back from E3, I'll probably pre-order it so I can just jump right back in Stick of Truth. I love Stick of Truth. Yeah, did you",

I love Stick of Truth. Yeah, did you Platinum it? No, I did not because I got it early before there was a guide and so I missed one Chinpokomon and I was like, I cannot, I can't justify going back and replaying. I'm excited about this because I want to pre-order just so I could play for the first time because when the the first one came out, it was during that weird transition period of IGN where we were like really becoming Kinda Funny and I was just like all work no play. But this definitely deserves my time. Okay, we good. Got great reviews. All the trailers are all of it looks fantastic. So can't wait. December. youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames. I was going to say, I night, you still, you were hosting. I was just saying, I'm trying to give you a a good pivot point, right? Say my final thing. Can't wait.

He's going to be even faster now in Lego Dimensions, you know, year two. No, yeah, sonic for C. Is this over? Well, no, we're talking about you now. We're talking about more video games and stuff. How excited for this game are you? I really want to play the first. Did it make you laugh? Yeah, it's very funny. Good. I'm very excited to play the first one. Do you think that the PS, do you think Ubisoft will, when can we get codes for that? Do you think Ubisoft will invite me back to host the South Park panel again at Comic-Con when I did that with Matt and Trey and it was just me and that on stage and there was like 6,000 people in it.

Also known as the Cone of Shame. Then you see the three Cone of Shame. There he is in all of his glory. I hear Greg thumping down the hall. Hey, Matt, Trey, it's me, Greg Miller again. We had a fun time. I touched one of your heads. I remember you didn't like that, but I won't do that again as you come host your Comic-Con panel.
