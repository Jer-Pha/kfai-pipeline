Yeah, demo, release date. Uh, yeah, you would assume so, November probably. They've talked about it long enough. They've, it's, it's been, well, it's been known well long enough. Yeah, Arkane's definitely ready to go. Cool. Fallout 4 DLC? No, I don't think so. I, I think you'll, I think you'll talk about Fallout 4. I think we talked a little bit on PS I Love You XOXO. I think that the, the ones they've announced are the ones you're going to get. Um, and I think it's time for them to move on, and I think they're going to go quiet. Far Harbor was the big one, so it's like, what, you have a couple supplemental. If anything, it gets mentioned in like, and we also still have exciting things coming for Fallout 4 on top of Far Harbor, which you just released for mods on these, you know. Yeah, I think they talk about mods. I think they talk about sales. I",

I think they talk about sales. I think they talk about the sustained support of it, new patches. I, I know that they want to do more content for Fallout 4. I don't, I don't know that it behooves them to do that. It just doesn't seem like Fallout 4 has the same buzz that Fallout 3 had. So, I mean, it has a substantial, but it's a **** massive game. But, you know, contextually speaking, I, I don't know that it's worth it for them to do that. And Fallout 3 had five pieces of DLC, including one, only one Far Harbor type piece of DLC, which was Point Lookout. So, um, I think it's obviously going to be there, uh, but I don't know that it's going to be a lynchpin. I don't know that anything from Bethesda Game Studios is going to be a lynchpin at this particular conference. That was last year.

I, I feel like, I don't know, it might be too hard to judge because, I mean, this is what I was saying on PS I Love You XOXO. It might be a little too harsh, but it's just to say like, I think people are kind of over this **** now in a, in a way where it's just like, let's see what you have, go away and, you know, make something. Like, we just got The Witcher 3, we just got Dying Light, just got Far, you know, Far Cry 4 and Far Cry Primal with these open-world games that look better, that run better, that play better, that are more fun. Like, you got to figure it out. And, and so, just take your time. You made hundreds of millions of dollars on this game. Just go away, but keep in",

Skyrim is beloved, everybody. It's not, it's not the same argument or problem that Fallout 4 has because it's contemporary with those. This one is a callback to this world you did love. It's beautiful. It's still the same gameplay. It's still a clunky here and there, but it's not on the same level of comparing it to Witcher 3. I'm with you. Could it, could be. The question then is like, who's porting it? And, you know, not that the Game Studios, and then which is, you know, possible. I mean, they have other studios that can do it. I just think that you remind people of the problems. I think Skyrim was a beloved game. I think it is a beloved game, but it came out five years ago. And, you know, let sleeping dogs lie. You",

So, you, there's no way that that game is in pre-production, I'm sure, but no, there's no way. Wolfenstein? Yeah, I think that, I think that, I really do think that MachineGames will be there. So, there's, there's conjecture that MachineGames might be working on Quake, which would be cool, but I hope that that's not the case. I think Wolfenstein's going to have a new game. The Wolfenstein, um, The New Order and The Old Blood were **** awesome, awesome games. And I think that it's time for them to show it. If it's not this year, it's going to definitely be next year.

But then again, they did that with Dishonored 2. So, um, MachineGames has been quiet, and I think that, uh, it's, it's, it's time. And I'm so **** excited. Like, that's definitely what I'm most excited about because they are so good, so very good. Yeah, Doom DLC. Yeah, probably. Yeah, Doom's, people love Doom, which I'm happy about. It did a really nice job. The new id. Evil Within 2, yes. Um, you think it's a teaser trailer or a demo? What are we getting? I, I think so. I don't know that you do.

Um, which, and I think that MachineGames might be further along. That's my assumption. I don't know for sure because Evil Within seems so tortured that it seems like that studio needs a little bit more time. I don't know, you're going to get both of those, but I think it's going to be one or the other. If it's both, then Bethesda is firing on all cylinders, and that's going to be **** awesome. Um, but Evil Within 2 is probably a 2017 game, and, and they're definitely going to do another one. I can see you getting them both, but I think you just get them in different doses.

That would be **** awesome. But I think that, but Evil Within DLC came out last spring, so I, I don't, I don't know that they've had enough time. Yeah, we'll see. The good, the good news is that they, they did develop, as far as I know, they developed all those SKUs internally, and they're not, so The Old Blood DLC wasn't on PS3 and Xbox 360, which means they were already walking away from that with fewer SKUs to make. So, only PS4, Xbox One, and PC could be quicker for them to make the game. They already have the engine. The engine's already beautiful, already rendering the game really beautifully. So, it's possible that it's ready this fall, but I don't know. I think those are both 2017 games. I would love ****",

I feel like you get a deep dive of Wolfenstein at, at this press conference, whether it's fall or whether it's spring. And I think Evil Within is just a teaser trailer and then the logo at the end. Do you think that it's possible MachineGames is doing Quake? It's anything's possible, but you, yeah, you'd really hope they. I think Bethesda is not stupid. I think they saw what happened here with people being excited about this Wolfenstein, this reinvigorated franchise, you know, finally somebody doing the name proud, finally giving this thing relevance again in the modern day. And I don't think you immediately gamble that away and put him on to Quake and say, do it again for Quake. Yeah, I don't, I don't think so either.",

Yeah, I don't, I don't think so either. I think it's possible Quake is, is under development somewhere else. 100%, 100%. But I, I think it would be smart to let them do Wolfenstein one more time, wrap that story up, the new B.J. story, uh, and then go, let them go to Quake and let that be out by 2020, whatever. I know I said B.J., it's B.J. Blazkowicz. Everyone goes, speaking of B.J.s, go suck a dick. All right, Greg, thank you. Anything else for Bethesda? Um, I still kick around this idea that Prey comes back, but I, I, but I don't, but I don't know who would make. I mean, it's possible. I mean, there are two Arkane Studios now, aren't there? A lot of rumors about, about it coming back. I've seen the last couple weeks just on, yeah, I mean, people been saying that. I mean, I, I saw Prey five years ago, Prey 2.

It was a great demo. Um, I saw it when Skyrim was revealed. That's how long ago it was, and it looked great. It actually looked better than Skyrim. Um, I think that's enough. When you really think about Bethesda, see what's so intriguing about Bethesda, it's like the mirror image of Deep Silver in my mind. Like, Deep Silver started to like rise in prominence a little bit, not as much, but then they just started like getting into the bed and releasing random **** that like doesn't behoove like the long-term sustainability of that publisher, right? So, you get like Homefront, and you're getting like, they have Saints Row, which is great, but then they're getting like Mighty No. 9, which people aren't really caring about, all these kinds of things. They're just kind of like middling, releasing these games. Like, Bethesda seems to take care of its",

Um, I know that doesn't let them scale, but I think if they treat their stuff with great care as they've been doing, I think it, it behooves them. So, I think when you think about, uh, Wolfenstein, um, possibility, Wolfenstein, the possibility of Evil Within 2, obviously Dishonored has already been announced and coming out. You chatter a little bit off Fallout and Doom. That's almost enough, right? Like, I, I just feel like you just walk away.

And then they were, they prove you wrong by coming out and having enough games, enough things people care about that they can come out and do another E3 press conference. It's unbelievable. And if they keep cycling like this, that's why I say, maybe you save Evil Within 2 for next year, and that's when you announce Elder Scrolls, maybe. But I don't know if you do that. Maybe that's when you announce a collection. That's when you bring back Prey. That's when you acquire a new studio. Um, that's when Wolfenstein's kind of coming out, so it gets the Wolfenstein, the Dishonored 2 treatment. Um, it's, it's complicated, but I'm actually most intrigued by Bethesda, with the exception of Sony. I'm most intrigued by what Bethesda does because I thought their, their press conference was quite effective last year.

So, I don't know that they, you don't need to do that. I don't, I, if I was one of these publishers, I wouldn't appear at anyone's thing. Be like, we're doing our own thing. We're agnostic, and we love everyone. I mean, I, I just don't think it's, I don't think it's good business. You know, it might be good business on the back end for them because they're obviously getting money, but optically, I don't think it's smart.

It was probably a stupid idea if they were unsure the game was going to be ready to announce. They should have probably waited to announce it this year. Um, but I think they're, were learning that they couldn't have foreseen that they probably thought the game was going to be ready. I think that that game's safe to go in the Q1, and I think we get a date. That's awesome. I really, really hope that's true. Battlefield, we see.

They come out, talk Battlefield, here's DLC, it's a new map, it's this thing, it's a tie into Rogue One, maybe. And then, here's what we're talk, where Battlefield is coming.

It's like September 9th to November 11th or something, like somewhere in there. We know because they said it's going to be within weeks of Battlefield, which I think is a huge **** mistake.

We know everything's out, so they put a statement. Ubisoft put out a statement saying that it'll be E3. Cool. So, yeah, obviously that will be there. Yeah, I'm feeling good about it too. I mean, I feel like, you know, looking at, at Ubisoft's track record, it's like Assassin's Creed to Assassin's Creed 2. Always, I imagine this being very similar. Everything I didn't like about Watch Dogs, we fixed in Watch Dogs 2. Or Mass Effect to Mass Effect 2. I mean, I, not that I think that all those changes were positive. I think Assassin's Creed is super overrated. But yeah, you get, you, you learn. And Uncharted to Uncharted 2. I mean, yeah, you put out the game, you see what happens. Watch Watch Dogs. See what people lose sighted with Watch Dogs is that that, that was first of all, the first next-gen game we had ever seen, which is makes it kind of cool when you think about it. We",

So, it's like hard to know what you're doing right or wrong. And so, I think that they're just going to go back, and they already have their engine. I don't think they have to like really **** around with any of that kind of stuff. The game looked fine. I think it's just the way it ran a little bit, and also more of the content in the gameplay. So, if they can just nail those things, and Watch Dogs is going to be a huge step ahead, and that will revitalize what I think is going to be an Assassin's Creed like",
