What's up, everybody? I'm Greg Miller, and this is the only does everything, Colin Moriarty. We are behind closed doors at the PlayStation booth at E3, and you just saw Days Gone. Does it live up to Eric Jensen's high bar? Eric Jensen, he's been working so goddamn hard over there in Oregon. It's really cool. It's, uh, I understand why people are a little skeptical about it. It seems like it's another zombie game. You know, we have Dead Rising, we have The Last of Us, we have, you know, State of Decay, State of Decay, we have Dead Island, we have, you know, Dying Light. I mean, there's a bunch of them, sure, but, and I get it, but like there's a little bit of a different wrinkle in this game. I think it's going to be cool. So first of all, the zombies aren't dead, they're Freakers. They're alive, okay? They eat, they drink, they sleep.",

They eat, they drink, they sleep. They do all these kinds of things, okay? Um, so, uh, they are infected by a virus that keeps them alive, so they have to eat, they have to drink, they have to sleep. Um, and you're dealing basically with of them in, uh, basically an ecosystem, uh, based on, uh, the high desert in Oregon. So a lot of, uh, you know, Crater Lake might be in there, they wouldn't say, et cetera, but that kind of area, okay? Um, and, uh, you're part of a biker gang, and it's an open world. We call them motorcycle clubs. I'm sorry, motorcycle clubs, MCs, yeah. Um, and it's a really, it's a nice idea. Uh, it's ominous, it's supposed to be, you know, I was talking to, you know, John Garvin was doing some Q&A, who's the writer, he's the lead, uh, of Bend Studio. Yeah, been writing, he wrote all their games the last 20 years, um, from Syphon Filter all the way through now and",

Yeah, been writing, he wrote all their games the last 20 years, um, from Syphon Filter all the way through now. And, uh, he was basically saying like the idea is it's somber, it's serious. Like there's no humor here. This is a world that's dying and dead and dangerous. So there's no like, there's no light, there's no humor. These people are really trying to stay alive. And the Freakers, these alive zombie-like creatures, are not the only danger, obviously the humans. So similar to, um, The Last of Us in that respect. He's saying basically there's a 50-50 chance that you're going to be up by a human or maybe they want to be your friend, okay? Um, but I tried to get more into the story in terms of the nature of like these Freakers, how do they get sick? What's the nature of the virus? If you get bitten or scratched, do you get sick? Like they would not talk about any of that kind of stuff. Um, the other thing before we get into the",

Um, the other thing before we get into the nature of the game is, and this was a little bit disappointing to me, if I'm interpreting it the right way, is I was like, I asked them, I'm like, \"You guys have not released a game since 2011 in the states,\" um, which is Golden Abyss. And I know that, you know, we know that they had some false starts apparently, maybe some PS3 games or a Vita game, a sequel to Golden Abyss, whatever, that didn't get off the ground. So they're not far along or as far along as I think a lot of people. And when I asked, \"Is this, is it safe to assume this is a 2017 game?\" They said, \"It is not safe to assume that.\" So either it's in the fall, which I doubt, or going to be waiting for a while, which would give them seven full years in between releasing games. Wow. Um, so that was a little bit disappointing because I'm really, you know, as",

Yeah. Um, make a game. Yeah, make a goddamn game. No, they're making their game. It just doesn't seem like it's going to be ready for prime time. Okay, what for? So what did you see? Did you like what you saw? Cause when I saw the presser and I saw the person conference, I thought it looked great. Yeah, not just because friend of the show Sam Witwer was in it. So they, they showed a very similar, it's the same, it's the same thing. Start the bike outside this like sawmill, this factory. Yeah. Um, it's just he went through it in a different way.

Uh, the interesting thing that he was talking about was we, we see the camp at dusk. So the Freakers hibernate during the day, they won't come out during the day, okay? And, uh, he was saying that if you get there during the day, you know, you have to do this particular quest, you can actually totally set traps and improvised explosives and all sorts of stuff and then run the Freakers like through these areas that you've already lined. In other words, you can like wait at night and stay safe and be patient and then get in there during the day and then get out of there before dusk and let them come out, then run through and they'll chase you.

The rumor always been that it was going to be this open world zombie motorcycle. Is that what it is? It is an open world. Uh, he said that it's expansive enough to take advantage of the motorcycle, cause I asked him, I'm like, \"What's the nature of there?\" But we can to compare. And he's like, \"Well, we, we designed this game with the motorcycle in mind, so you're going to be traveling around a lot.\" The interesting thing that he said was that, uh, no urban environments. This really is based in like Central and and Eastern Oregon. There's not a lot going on over there. So you might get some outposts, some villages or something like that. No big cities, not like, you know, um, not like Portland or anything like that. So, um, there is that. They talked a little bit about the quest structure, not too much. I mean, in terms of like, you are going to be questing.",

I mean, in terms of like, you are going to be questing, there are going to be side quests, they're going to, you know, there is a main story. Um, someone in there asked about, \"Can you play it passively and not fight?\" And that is possible, although with the particular quest they were showing, it is not possible because your quest there is to destroy the horde in that area. And I don't know quite why this wasn't in the build, but they were saying that in the game when you're fighting a horde, there is a number in the corner of the screen indicating how big the horde is. Okay, so like you're whittling, you see yourself whittling them down. And, and they're, like they're not sponges, they take damage and fall, but it's because they're alive. Yeah, that makes sense.

And the other, you know, I noted kind of making fun of it a little bit during PS I Love You XOXO, I think we're saying like, \"How many bullets does this machine gun have?\" Like, yeah. And he was saying they didn't want to talk about the upgrade trees and all that kind of stuff, but there is an upgrade system. And he was saying like, \"You can read into the fact that he has 800 bullets for a machine gun, that there's that, that's not what you start with.\" Um, we also saw him crafting, um, and there basically a bar appears on the right side of the screen. Oh, so more than just the silencer thing. Yeah, so you still, still put the silencer, which is the oil pump from the, from the truck into the gun, but we saw him actually make a Molotov with things he was finding in, in the environment as well.",

Okay, uh, interesting, uh, wrinkle. Another interesting wrinkle, and what, what's really strange about this being a first-party game is that it's not using a proprietary engine. Um, it's using Unreal Engine 4. Um, this is unusual for a first-party Sony game to not be using their own stuff. Obviously they use middleware and all that kind of stuff, but the, I thought that was interesting that they basically shopped around and, um, and apparently found this, this particular engine. It makes no sense for their game. So it's being written internally by John Garvin. Uh, doesn't look like it's coming out till 2018, unless you can read into that, uh, that they're just playing around or they're trying for 2017. I mean, to assume, but it's possible, right?

I understand people's skepticism, but I think this is Bend's coming out party. I think they have a lot to prove and I think they know that. So I think they should take their time. It's just surprising that we're maybe going to wait way longer than I thought to get their game. Yeah, cause you were thinking it might even be this year. That was going to be because they've been quiet for so long and we, we've heard, you and I've heard rumblings for a long time that they, they had games that didn't get off the ground. So it's not like they were just not doing anything after Golden Abyss. It's just that those games, they might have dumped a year or two into those games and that then had to come up with this idea for for Days Gone. And I guess this also indicates why Dead Don't Ride doesn't make any sense as a name, which was that, which was at one point",
