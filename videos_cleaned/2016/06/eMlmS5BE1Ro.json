What's up, guys? I'm Tim Gettys. This is Greg Miller. Again, this is another Kinda Funny Reacts E3 2016. This time we're looking at the Injustice 2 announcement trailer and the Gameplay trailer. Right? We a lot of Injustice stuff happening here. Take it away, Greg. All right, so that is Superman. You may not know this, a lot of people don't know this about him. Real name Kal-El. Came here from Krypton. No, um, this visually, I don't think there's a lot to go through in terms of some of the stuff that's happening. We'll get there. This is a great debut trailer showing off the beating of Flash. Everybody coming together to fight, debuting Supergirl, which of course I freaked out about, but I called on calling Greg, like, yeah, we're seeing a bunch of little this super armor stuff going on. Sure now, and what when we were seeing this, like, this is",

Sure now, and what when we were seeing this, like, this is always the thing whenever you make a Justice League fighting game, people are always like, well, how are they going to fight each other? All this stuff falls their mouth. It's just that I hate hear having to hear all the time. Um, what's interesting about Injustice 2, of course, is that Injustice 1 was such a great story. Injustice 1, of course, this whole thing of an alternate universe where Superman accidentally kills Lois Lane, then he kills the Joker for real and kind of becomes like the, you know, ruler of the world and takes over and becomes a despot. Um, that was settled in in the Injustice game. The Injustice comic book series still going on, but telling the lead-up to that stories was really good with Tom Taylor. Little, little, it's time to bring that one in. It's time to end Injustice. Um, I boy,",

I we'll get to Aquaman in the trailer because our friend Destin Legarie from IGN has some interesting ideas about him, the Gameplay trailer that I want to bring up. Um, but now we're jumping to this one where I assume it's going to be another different Universe in the Multiverse, a new story, whatever, where we jump in where, yes, everybody has to fight each other. A lot of people, I want to point out, were calling out that this is Kryptonite. Could be Kryptonite in Batman's suit. I also want to put out there, maybe it's Venom. Maybe he needed to use Bane's Venom to get an upper hand on all this. But now you're bringing up all the armor, and so what I, and then I talked for like 10 minutes, what I like about the armor and what's interesting about the armor is the fact that in the",

They actually do a thing with Batman where it's all going, it's a bunch of different armor. Reason being, they talked about this in the debut, uh, their announcement for Injustice 2, in the fact that you get to create your own character pretty much on this. You get to build your own armor set for the characters. So you assume you're getting an alternate universe tale out in the Multiverse where everybody's fighting each other, and for some reason or another, Superman's weakened, everybody's weakened, magic has been cast to make level the playing field. Of course, you know, Superman vulnerable magic here. Supergirl, as I said, uh, right in here. I like, and this is Atrocitus, of course, from the Red Lanterns. Of course, of course, every that",

Of course, of course, every that, except a lot of people, again, our friend Destin Legarie was like, who's this red guy? I'm like, Destin, you know Atrocitus from the Red Lantern. Colin, can you believe that? No, I can't believe. Thank, buddy. Uh, Gorilla Grodd over here kicking the out of some people. Uh, right out here, like, are we now, how, how much do you want to freeze frame this? Because I'd like to see this. Can you freeze frame it and bring me back to these statues? Because now this has been out a few days, but we've been so busy. I first off like the idea that they're using a Supergirl suit where her legs are covered. Uh, even in New 52, when they gave her like the, they gave her like a leotard, but her thighs were still out. Now in this TV show, she's got a skirt, but she's got like a pants on underneath that or whatever. Just put her in a full bodysuit so we",

I, I, I don't think that this is all happenstance. This is all coincidence. If you're asking me why Lex is here rebuilding, something has happened. Something's come to Earth, and that's why we suddenly have all these people who have abilities, who are out there to able to fight, able. I think it was Gorilla Grodd or whatever. Oh my God, Grodd. I think it was him. You're a piece of, all right, keep going. It's not Gorilla Grodd, guys. It's Gorilla Grodd. Please go. But this is interesting. I think this is some kind of Memorial Plaza that's going to play into the story of what's happening. But I don't know much about it beyond that, obviously.

What I find interesting about Aquaman is that this would have been, I think, the perfect opportunity to bring in a Jason Momoa looking Aquaman. Yeah, you know what I mean? Turn, it's interesting to me that you find something interesting about Aquaman, but you know, New 52 Aquaman. No, I have, you're a piece of garbage. Read that, right? Give the first five, give the first Arc. Okay, he eats fish in the first episode. Because I've been talking about Aquaman for a long time, as most people have. Yeah, well, this a horrible costume. But when I, when I saw him in this trailer, I was like, this is weird that he's white.

We already saw traditional blond hair, blue-eyed Aquaman in Injustice 1. Why not give it another one? So now, stop right there. See, this is the one I really want to know about. It's because we have a hero holding another hero here. Stop. So that, that's Superman holding who, I don't know, you could be any, maybe Lois Lane again. Superman holding up the world here. Guy with a Clark Kent. Maybe they, they, they've revealed that, you know, Clark Kent to Superman. We'll figure it out. We'll find out. Yeah, man, they really like this guy. Well, yeah, you know, he's Superman again. They're going to be more of this smashing through the walls. Now, of course, I don't this, why would she not just that car?

They're talking about how this is basically building out all the stuff for you. Atrocitus spitting all the hate on them, all the rage. Then Grodd yelling. There we go. Then see here, we start seeing people put on different armor, and the defines you as the importance. See, they're talking about here is like how different all the different Batman looks can be. That looked like I was just pointing at Supergirl's breasts. I wasn't. I can if you want me to. So we got some Red Lantern, yeah, sh going on. I, I love this Batwing thing though.

I'd like to know what playing at the theater. Hidden Crisis Double Feature. Hidden Crisis is what it says. Hidden Crisis. Yeah, Crisis. That's always a big thing in DC. You know that. You know that. Every, know that. You do know that. Grodd is hitting with the bull here, getting this thing screwed up, shooting around, punching Superman, grabbing them, throwing them. Aquaman doing stuff. Oh, and then Aquaman, Aquaman just creating some kind of dinosaur fish that I'm sure is dead. The dinosaur fish. The good old classic dinosaur. Sure. Shout out to Aquaman though. Now, what's interesting about Aquaman, and I didn't see it, is that the Gameplay trailer, that was the Gameplay trailer. Is there just gameplay out? I saw one. I, I didn't see Black Manta there. Did you see Black Manta? No, no, there was like an IGN had like a 18-minute like gameplay thing that they did. Okay.",

No, no, there was like an IGN had like a 18-minute like gameplay thing that they did. Okay, cool. Because Destin Legarie over at IGN has an interesting theory that Black Manta is just an alternate skin for Aquaman because they use a similar weapon, have some similar moves. Because that's the thing, I love the lore of Injustice 2. I cannot play a fighting game to save my life. When I played Injustice 1 just to get the story, what I did is I'd fight, and if I won, great. And then if I lost the first round, I would just leave the controller there for two more rounds because then it was just like the guy would just let me beat him to death so I could see the story. And I was like, thank you, Ed Boon. Thank you for making a game I can play and enjoy too. Yeah, I guess that makes a lot of sense. Do you think it, it's an alternate skin, or do you think it's like a clone character where like Smash Bros. where like I",

I would, it would be an alternate skin where you bumper over and there you go. But I think Black Manta's will get his own character.
