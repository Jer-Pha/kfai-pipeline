Professor Greg Miller. Adjunct Professor Greg Miller. Let me tell you about particle physics. Oh my God, it's weird 'cause that feels really right. I don't like it, Greg. I don't like them. Particle purple crew, purple crew, purple crew, pink brown crew over there. Oh, the brown. I'll give you the brown. Thanks. I'll give you the Browner. Oh, actually, you'll give it to me in the brown.

We of course worked out of the GameSpot Booth today doing the cross Kinda Funny business that'll be up on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames. Isn't that right, Kevin? Yeah, thank you. And uh, while we were doing that, we didn't, we saw, we talked to a lot of people about their games. David Cage, Detroit. David Cage, I think his name is. No, I heard Cage, heard chicken. Uh, we talked about a lot of games and then we ended. We had 2 hours to go run around and play things, so we all ran around for 2 hours and played stuff. Tomorrow, many things tomorrow. And the next day, we're playing a whole bunch of stuff. We're seeing a whole bunch of behind closed doors stuff. We're going to tell you all about",

Well, let's start with you, Colin, because you're going to be leaving pretty soon for meetings, business meetings and stuff. By business meetings, I mean the yearly big old Jeremy Dunham Morton's Steakhouse Extravaganza round up. That's you get some, you get some of your scoops you can't talk about, but you talk about. And then you'll also get us those sweet Rocket League exclusives, which isn't a joke. They're coming by to Let's Play tomorrow with some of the exclusives. Well, as you know, Rocket League was one of the ultimate Colin Was Right moments. And so we get basically first right of refusal on everything Rocket League. It's true, true.

But other, other than that, this, I didn't even take an appointment last year other than like some Sony behind closed doors things. So it's the first time I even went to a third party publisher at E3 since we were at IGN. Um, and I saw Mafia III and I saw Civilization VI. Okay, now the most important thing to tell you about Mafia III is I had a pee really badly throughout the entire demo, but I still, I still paid as close attention as I possibly could. Sure. Uh, it is an open world. Is exactly what you think it is. It is an open world, uh, sandbox action shooter, third person. Uh, it takes place in a version of New Orleans. I don't remember the name of it. It's not New Orleans, kind of like number two. Um,",

It's not New Orleans, kind of like number two. Um, and uh, it's actually quite dynamic. It reminded me in some small way of Godfather II, which was kind of like the underplayed EA published open world sandbox game that came out in like 2009. Maybe it's the game we got like six months before it came out. I'll never forget that as long as I live. We had to put in that long key to play it. I remember. Yeah, it was like, it was, we, I don't know why the **** that game was done so early and then it's never released. It anyway, uh, it's cool. Thematically, it's really interesting. Looks a little bit old, a little bit dated. I mean, obviously, there's a marquee titles in this particular genre. The most marquee title of all actually is in the genre, Grand Theft Auto V. And so you have to really do a lot to beat it. And I don't think this game is even trying to do that, but",

And I don't think this game is even trying to do that, but there's cool systems and mechanics in the game that I really thought were interesting. Um, and uh, the one cool thing I, I like is that so basically you're playing as a black Vietnam War veteran in 1968. Um, a great time to be minority. Exactly. And that, that plays a lot into the, the southern setting. Yeah, basically, uh, there's a like a, an Italian white mob and a black mob in the city. And the Italian mob, uh, basically all but uh, eviscerates the black mob, leaving some sort of revenge story to be taken on. Um, and so you play as this, uh, Vietnam vet, Vietnam War veteran. He looks like he's in his mid to late 20s. Um, and what's cool about it is that he has like, uh, three lieutenants basically that he can take over parts of the city and then give them the parts of the city to take care of.

But depending on the decisions you make, they showed a part of the game where it's like you kind of **** one of your lieutenants over, so he actually turns on you completely and you have to, you have to kill him. Um, and so there's all these like branching paths in the game that are pretty interesting in that respect. That sounds cool. Um, and you like sit, you have a sit down with them after you take over part of the city and like they make a pitch as to why like you, you get like you give them the city or whatever. So one of them is like a black woman who's like a native, I think of the city. One of them is like a, like an Irish dude who's like a mobster. And one of them is an Italian mobster who is like betraying. Um, uh, I, I was, I was hands off. Gotcha. They chose, they chose the Italian dude and then the Irish guy actually turned",

But you, you go to his like compound, which is like a steel mill or something and you like kill all his men and stuff like that. So there's like, it, it is super rife with things to do. Um, and that sounds great. I, I, I like that about Mafia II. I like, and I like the little, the parts you're talking about. I can deal with it not being on Grand Theft Auto's level. It's definitely not. But I mean, but I mean, maybe it is. I mean, I haven't played it, but I mean, just aesthetically and stuff like that. But there's a ton of **** to do.

And there's like a bunch of them, kind of cool. Um, so like it shows you how much money they're making and everything you do in the game whittles down the amount of money they're making until it's down to zero. So like you can go after like their drug runner, you can go after like the guy who like launders their money, or you can like go burn down like their facility where they, they make drugs or whatever. And then that money like total whittles down to zero. And once it's whittled down to zero, looks like you take over that part of the city, then you give it to one of your people and then you go about your business. So it is very, it is very step by step in that, in that respect. And there's a whole story throughout it as well as",

Are those the, the three different things that you're seeing the, the money go up and down? Or is there no, it's like they're like, they're the ones that are like with you. And then there are like rival gangs or like, like different gangs that are you're like trying to kind of screw around. So they show you like going into a brothel and this woman, this guy is like getting a uh, lap dance by this woman. Um, and you like kind of stealth in and shoot him in the head and like it says like minus $10,000 whatever on the thing or whatever. And you like get money and then like it whittles down the money and then you get out of there. Um, and so it's kind of cool. Like I, I can see myself kind of, kind of getting into",

October 7th, I think that comes out. Awesome. And then Civ VI. Civ VI. Uh, you know, so Civilization V, I am not by any respect an OG Civ fan. I didn't get into Civilization at all until V. Um, and I really loved V. I still think Civilization V is probably one of the games I played the most of in my entire life. And by hours played, I played that game for **** ever. Um, or what felt like forever. I mean, who the **** knows? You were playing a PC, so it could have been 15 minutes. It always, I just remember, I just remember for, I remember what seems like I, I've gone back to it many times in the past or several times in the past, but I remember what feels like like several months",

I don't think I played anything else when that game came out for a while on like multiple accounts. I think because I just, I think I downloaded it like multiple times too. I think I just bought it again like last year. Um, so um, because I have no idea how to use Steam. Sure. So um, that's how it works. Anytime you want to play a PC game, you buy it again. Buy it again. So there are little tweaks. I don't, I don't know that I even recognize all of them being an, oh, like not an OG Civ fan. But there like you can like layer troops on top of each other now on tiles, which is pretty cool. You can start to make like settlements around your cities. So like it's basically",

The entire video they show, which is like 15 or 20 minutes, which is basically someone playing and and with narration showing you like how your Civilization obviously grows from like the embryonic like animal husbandry and agriculture stage to like space. Um, which is the entire idea of the game. And that's one of the ways you can obviously win in Civilization. So um, it looks cool. Enhanced graphics. Battles are cool. What the great things about Civilization is the asymmetric way that you and other Civilizations around you grow. And so at the end they showed um, Egypt invading your country and your China. And this and obviously people that know Civilization know you can pick your leader and then you get like all these benefits and perks. Um, they",

But China's like way more technologically advanced than them. So they counterattack. And so it's basically like tanks and airplanes fighting against like people on horseback. So these are the kinds of things. So these are the kinds of things that you can get. I mean, like you can reach, as people know, and like you can get reach the Renaissance in like 1100. And you can reach like the Space Age like 1600 if you really play it really well. You know, like so it doesn't necessarily have to make any sense. Um, so a lot of that seems to be intact. It looks **** awesome. Also comes out in October. Super excited about it. Um, met someone from the developer for the first time too and and chatted just for a brief moment with him.

Kind of get that New Orleans flare, New Orleans flavor. So cool. It didn't get in the way of the game. They're not one of those things. Not like Perry Farrell yelling in your ear while you're asking. No, you could hear it through, but the, but the, the demo was so loud that you, it drowned the demo. J. They didn't have jambalaya, which was and Zapps. They didn't have Zatarain's. So yeah, those are the two games I saw. And then tomorrow, obviously, we're going to see a bunch of first party stuff or something. Those will be broken out throughout the day. Now, what time is it?

Is it? It was none of the things I thought it was going to be. Uh, the deal is that this is going to be a 60-minute experience. So an hour-long experience.

You, he's talking to you about, you know, being Batman or whatever. And like that there's something going on. You need to, he'll meet you in the cave. He goes, I believe this is what you're looking for. And reaches out his hand and he's got a key in it. And it's all second nature. It all makes perfect sense.

Greg Miller can't, but I like he reached out and my hand went from like the the I think it might have been the open handed it went to a finger so it's like you can hit every the keys you want to hit. You totally could hit what you want, I assume. Imagine, sure. But it expands out and then like I'm standing on the elevator and we just start descending into the Wayne Manor.

Uh, the cowl comes down, you reach out with both hands, grab it, turn it, put it on and then they bring in a mirror so you can like adjust it and you're moving your head perfectly and it's one of those things again with VR where I know how VR works.

This is now my answer because totally like I as soon as they announced, I'm like, this is going to be a 10-minute experience and whatever. Like, no, I'm shooting the grapple and do this. But then they're like, you want to see the second part? And it's like, **** yes, I want to see the second part. And you click over and it's a crime scene investigation, right?

And so I'm just like doing everything you've done in Arkham Knight, but I'm doing it and like at points I'm dodging cuz it's like it's not that I'm from the other side of the screen watching like they are brawling in front of me and like I can get as close as I want to Nightwing while this is happening or to the, you know, the outline of the C.

I think when we were watching the PlayStation conference and we were like, oh ****, Resident Evil, oh ****, Batman.

But I think that we're we're a step beyond the people that haven't used VR yet, you know? So then when we get opportunities to play games like Batman or I'm assuming the Star Wars game, we're kind of already primed and ready to be not disappointed, but we we know what to expect.

I I definitely like the more tightly knit focus things. But it won me over. Like I want to play this. And going into it, what I was talking about in the the Game of the Show thing, um, I was saying that I was thinking I was going to give my my Game of the Show nod to Horizon. Yeah, having just seen the Zelda trailer, I wasn't that impressed by it. I was like, this looks great. It's Zelda. Obviously, we all know it's going to be good. But it didn't wow me in the same way that Horizon. I gave it my Game of the Show last year to Horizon. And this time I was like, they wowed me again. Like it looks awesome. This looks like a game that I really want to play. And honestly, I wish Zelda looked like that. Like they have very similar aesthetics and especially after playing it now and then seeing it",
