Hi, how you guys doing? Good. Okay. Having a good Colin's shirt always makes me think for a second it's a Red Dead shirt because it's black and it says red. I'm like, R, it's my Red Dead 3 shirt. Northeastern. Northeastern. They're going crazy. Yeah, horses over there. We done with Mexico. They're riding in the tunnels underneath Northeastern. You guys playing any fun games lately? Oceanhorn. Oceanhorn. I continue to play that. What's up with that? Uh, it's a Zelda knockoff. I think we were talking about that on last week's Gamescast.

I was like, oh, it's Zelda in the way of like, I got my sword, I got my shield, you know, ice, whatever, top down or not top down, you know, whatever out. Uh, going through, chopping up stuff, getting pots, smashing them. I get the things, go through and play it. And then it was like, oh, now you got to go in this boat to another Island. I got in the boat. I'm like, well, this **** looks exactly like Wind Waker. Is there a Talking Dragon? Not yet. I haven't had a Talking Dragon yet. Not yet, not yet. No, no, no. But I haven't been shooting a whole bunch of other the people, but there's like creatures that are like totally like, this guy pops out of the ground and shoots the pebble at me, and I'm like, oh, knock it right back at him.

Because we talked about it before on the last Gamescast, and then somebody was like, yeah, this came out to Apple TV. It's been out for years or whatever, and showed them playing with it. And when playing it, I knew it seemed simple, and it has that thing of like, um, you're in a new area, here are the three challenges and stuff. That's such a mobile trope or whatever. But just like this, the Steam version that's super well-rated, this one is fun. There's something about it. It's just, you know, that formula and this style. There's no like deep story to it.

Not really. I, uh, before PAX, we worked that whole week, and then PAX, and then so I've not played anything except for, uh, the, uh, I got most of the way through Inside. I was getting the trophies. Um, and then Erin wanted to play it, so I started playing with her or whatever, and starting again. And I got to really, so I don't know how the game ends. Um, I'm, we're going to get there hopefully today after work, but, um, because I'm kind of super curious actually about what this game is all about. Uh, I got to give a shout out to this game. This game is a master class of design, and, um, it's, I'm really happy you like it. It's an absolutely brilliant game. I wouldn't, I wouldn't expect you to. It's awesome.

I don't, I don't understand, as we said before, what, what, why is this so acclaimed? Like, it's, it's a fun, clever little game. I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that it was the really one of the proving grounds of like the viability of the downloadable platform. Um, Inside is so clever, and I, you can tell why it took a long time to make because obviously they're a small team. They have the money to, to take their time. Limbo's on everything, and they made a **** ton of money. But, um, I like how there nothing in the game happens by chance. And this is, and this is a, this is a, and nothing's coincidental in the game. Everything's there for a reason.

And obviously, in a linear game like that, that's easy to do in premise, but designing, uh, an interesting feedback loop where you almost want to die, um, to see what happens. And that, that is one of the mechanics in the game is just figuring out what happens if you pull this switch, just so you see, just so you know. Um, and one of the cool things that with Erin specifically is because she doesn't play games and she's learning is that like, she's learning. It's fun watching someone learn what I would call gaming logic in this game. I'm like, well, there's just pull the box or like, pull the switch and like, figure out what happens. Like, things we take for granted. But what the coolest thing in the, in, I don't even want to talk about specific parts, but there's a, there's a part in the game that I think is maybe the most clever, one of the most clever things I'd ever seen in a game before.

Ah, and I was like, it's very simple, and it's super **** creepy, and it opens that part of the game, opens the story up in a very specific way if you pay attention. But I'm like, this is so, this takes a high level of like game know-how to make a game like this and nuance. It's all about nuance. And I love how every death in the game is not even in a, in a AAA well-received game like Uncharted 4. Drake's falling off a cliff, and he clips through the world, and there's like a scream that you heard five times. That's it, right? Or in Metal Gear, old Metal Gear games, always the Snake or whatever. But it's like, it just goes, and that's, you know, like, you know, the game over thing, whatever.

It's like, there's three ways to die here, and each of those is like a very designed, specific way to die. It's not brutal too. Yeah. And I'm like, I'm like, it's so cool. This game is really cool. There's another part of the game, uh, where you pull a switch, and if you just wait for minutes, like, there's no reason to wait, but if you just wait for minutes on end, you see these guys pull out a machine and like, it, it literally takes probably two minutes. They eventually wheel out this thing and then turn it on, and then it eventually just finds you. So like, you can leave the game just sitting there for like five minutes, and then eventually it'll kill you. Um, and so I was not knowing how it ends and all that kind of stuff. I",

Like, I really don't know. Like, I really have no idea like what. I can't wait to talk to you about. I have no assumption of what it, what it even is. And, um, I just think it's an absolute master class in game design. Like, this is exactly what I'm talking about when I say like, the, the, the answers to our problems in gaming do not come from necessarily power of the machine, but from **** clever minds that work within the confines of what we already have. And this game doesn't have even need a PS4 or Xbox One to run. And, uh, they might have to draw back the graphics, whatever, it wouldn't make the game any less, you know, any less awesome.

Well, this has been the most annoying thing about, I mean, there's many annoying things about Andy Cortez from Rooster Teeth, but one of the most, one is that he, I feel like, remember when we were at Rooster Teeth at one time and Emily showed us, hey, this is your blue hoodie. We like, oh, great. I didn't have anything on it yet. It was just when they were prototyping it. Andy then just started wearing that blue hoodie, and I'm not sure if he found it in the trash out back or whatever, but he wears this blue hoodie that's clearly supposed to be a Kinda Funny hoodie. But was it? And now he's all around. It's like he's got to stop that **** now. Yeah, I'll buy you a **** 180 if you want, so you stop **** wearing the knockoff version.

Greg, yeah, you brought up an interesting topic that I would like to talk about today on the Kinda Funny Gamescast, which is back to school gaming. Sure.

Well, it's always, I mean, it's, it's, you know, this is a conversational podcast, and I want you to run with the topic in any way you do.

But when I think back to school gaming, right? I think of like, that was always the, this for me, it was always NCAA Football. At the end of July, it would come out, and that was like the first thing of like, man, I can't, I got this game, and I only have three weeks left before school starts, so I'm going to pour on all my time into this, play it non-stop. You know, this is going to be my life once this game comes out. And that was always the thing of it was sad getting ready to go back to school in a way. You know, I, I think it was you that were talking once about how you get excited, you see your friends, you do all these different things. I get that part. But of course, then you also have to sit around with a bunch of shitty teachers telling you **** you don't care about, and you **** hate them. Uh, but the good point, right, is that meant fall was",

Uh, but the good point, right, is that meant fall was starting. And when fall is starting, that means games are coming. You were getting into Holiday Rush. You're always looking for that, you know, that first major break with Thanksgiving, all this different stuff. But then even October with Halloween being great, the best holidays we've covered before. There's all these different games coming on October. That's gaming. And like big releases go hand in hand with school, I think, starting back up. And so that's where I'm coming from in terms of what games you associate with going back to school. Because like I said, for me, it's, it's NCAA Football. It was that one month to it. I've told the story before of like, when I had an internship out in D.C., and then when I was even like a, uh, in, you know, getting ready in between Washington D.C., just to be clear, not an internship",

Can you **** imagine? My life would be so much different. I guarantee you someone out there thinks you had an inter. No, that'd be amazing. Thanks, Jim Lee, for **** nothing. As always, tweeted Jim Lee, everybody, and tell him thanks for nothing. Greg, don't say the **** part, just thanks for nothing. Um, but being out there, getting so ready, you know, I remember working in my, the place my mom worked, which was like this paper company or whatever, and like being on GameFAQs all the time, waiting and getting. And then when they got that game, you know, I've told the story before of P.O. and I bringing his, his PlayStation 2 over us till 6:00 in the morning, playing in the basement, switching TVs when somebody got a big game.

And I was sitting there playing NCAA, and my friend, uh, Reese and Pratt came in, and they, they were, we were all going out to lunch or something, and I was like, let me, we wait for somebody to shower or whatever. They came in like, oh, cool, I play. Sure. And I hand it over, and I play. This is when you had profiles on your memory cards. It was a big deal. You know, kept all your stats, huge deal. And so like, we're setting up, you know, we get the line of scrimmage, hike the ball, and whatever, blah, blah. And then it was like, the stats faded up, and it was, you know, my Greggy profile, and it was something like, and I'm not, I'm not **** you, it was something like 306 wins, you know, 167 losses. And Pratt's like, you've played this game more than 500 times.",

You know what I mean? Like, I'm not skipping anything. And it was like so ludicrous to him, but for me, it was like such a thing of like, oh, I'm cut from a different cloth than the rest of the people. Even people who casually play this game are not playing it the way I do, are not consuming it the way I do. And so that was a big part of like, you know, bringing these experiences back to school and then having to interweave them, right? And I was talking about high school, you know, while not back to the school in the first few weeks, game, the wrestling games, right? Always October, early November.

And so that's what I think about in terms of like, **** sitting in class, like, jonesing, being ready to go, you know, so **** ready for, or like buying the PlayStation 2 on October 26th, 2000. Like, you know, having to go from school to Mayer Adam Brown's house, back to school, and then taking the next day off just to **** play that thing all the time. But that's back to school gaming for me. I mean, yeah, you saying that kind of does jot a lot of things in my mind where I definitely was not a sports game player at all.

Um, some of the things would trickle out in October or whatever, but it, those August games were key. Yeah, because there would always be like one of them. Like, I remember one year it was, uh, Soulcalibur II was the big one that everyone was super stoked. It was, it was always there. It wasn't, it might have been something, I think it was two, but two or three. Uh, that was such a huge deal because Soulcalibur I was so amazing. But Soulcalibur II, the three different versions, either getting Heihachi on PS2, which no one gave a **** about, Spawn on Xbox, which was random awesome, or Link in the GameCube version, which obviously was superior.

But like, having a new kind of fighting game, especially one with Link, and one that felt like that, that was a fun multiplayer experience. You know, that was something where for at least a couple months, like all my friends were coming over, and we were taking turns facing off against each other. Uh, and then it was out of that same year, that the year after that, there was F-Zero GX that came out. And man, that might be one of the most underrated games of last two generations ago. The last F-Zero game, right, of like console. Yeah, I mean, there was one after that on GBA, um, Maximum Velocity, I think.

Like, if that was on PS4, that would just be mind-blowing because the, it was so hard. Like, the, the career mode in that game is like just, it's **** up how hard it is. But it was fun, and whenever you accomplish something, it felt good. Uh, but the multiplayer was like, once you, it's different than Mario Kart. And the Mario Kart, there's all these items, all these ways to **** around. But F-Zero, if you're, it's skill-based. Like, you playing through, you mastering the drift system.
