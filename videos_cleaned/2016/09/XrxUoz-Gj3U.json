It's absolutely shocking about but what is shocking, no, is that it's not the NX, but Nintendo is still talking about things in 2016, a shocking amount of things. Nobody expected them to come out with that much stuff at the Direct. Nobody expected them to show up at Apple's conference. Run me through what they did to the Direct, because I heard about the Direct, but we were at PAX. We on the way to, we were doing something when the we traveling to PAX happened like right right before announ a bunch of 3DS games. Whole bunch of stuff happened.

Um, got an NX coming up. What do you need about it? They also released another bundle for the the New 3DS that is Mario themed with a Mario 3D Land, uh, bundled in and two cover plates at a reduced price. So that's cool. Um, the big kind of theme of it was the Zelda 30th Year Anniversary, which, uh, they seem to be doing a decent job with. They announced a Zelda amiibo line. Uh, we're going to get a classic 8-Bit Link amiibo, uh, similar to the 8-Bit Mario amiibo that we saw. People are in an uproar because he has a nose.

All of these available December 2nd, and they will have, uh, compatibility with NX Breath of the Wild when it comes out next year. Yeah. Um, and the Wii U. In bad 3DS news, this is from the Direct, but in similar, um, anniversary fashion, Metroid Prime: Federation Force sold fewer than 5,000 copies in damn. Yeah, who would have called it? In Japan. In Japan. That Greg's loud damn was over there. Yeah, okay, but still, it's sold poorly in the UK as well. So we can you can extrapolate that it's selling poorly everywhere. Not a huge surprise. The game's not supposed to be that bad. Oh, I've heard it's pretty bad. I heard it's like okay. I didn't hear that was I mean, it's getting fives and sixes. Yeah, that's not bad.

There's apparently some story **** at the end that might be relevant, but I don't just can't bring myself to really care to the Metroid. The the story of Metroid that is important. I I don't know. Someone was saying some words being thrown around. Someone on NeoGAF was reading about something saying like, Metroid needs to become more about than just Samus, Metroids, and and Ridley forever. I saw that. Yeah, and it's it's a good, it's a solid point. But then when they they try it, they it hasn't been too successful. Like you see with the Other M.

Uh, no, no, Remember Me. No, it wasn't that guy. You wouldn't have remembered because he was new there. So yeah, anyway, I just thought it was an interesting aside. I think I still am confident we're going to see a Metroid game, uh, on NX at or near launch. Yeah. Uh, then there you know, Dragon Quest talk, all that stuff. Yeah. Oh, that's whole bunch of them. Just, uh, just a little bit of that Dragon Quest talk. Dragon Quest VII, September 16th. Yep. Dragon Quest VIII, still TBA. Yep. Dragon Quest XI, still TBA. Can't wait for XI. We have I've had I didn't realize VII was so far away because I've had it for like two weeks just sitting there. I don't know where my 3DS is.

The last game I played was on 3DS was Zelda or maybe Fire Emblem. But yeah, anyway, doesn't matter. Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse on September 20th. There's more Yo-kai Watch coming, more Phoenix Wright coming. Uh, Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon. Sun and Moon obviously got a big final push, or not final push, but like one of its final pushes. If you pre-order, you get Munchlax, which is Snorlax's little baby form. He's adorable. Uh, they showed new Alola Forms, which Alola Forms are like the Hawaii like the the new thing in this game. But what's real, um, key to them is that they're all are the classic Pok\u00e9mon, but kind of with new identities or whatever. We saw a Dark type, or not Dark, yeah, Alola Form, which is a Dark type for Rattata, um, which everyone",

Uh, but it's cool to see Pok\u00e9mon that we like with new forms and stuff. So I'm happy they're doing that. Uh, there's rumors of a demo soon for Sun and Moon that wasn't in the Direct, but post-Direct people have been talking about that. Uh, November 18th is the release date for those games. Mario Party: Star Rush had a little focus on it, November 4th. Um, it's previewing okay. Uh, at PAX, people saying that they enjoyed it way more than they did the Island Tour, which I totally understand, because that game was trash. Um, Mario Party on the the Game Boy Advance and DS and 3DS has been something that I never quite understood. Yeah, Mario Party is supposed to be multiplayer.

So your long car rides, maybe your plane rides. Yeah, but that requires a lot, you know, that's like a Nintendo family. Yeah, buy multiple, be Nintendo friends. Think all them, think all the times you played Mario Golf with me on the plane. I will, right? Never. All of them. Yeah. Um, but then we start getting to the real ****. Super Mario Maker coming to 3DS. Finally, finally. Uh, December 2nd. Now it has most of the features of the Wii U one. It's missing a few things. You can't make all the features are there in terms of like course creation and stuff, except for the amiibo Mystery Box Mushroom stuff.

So that kind of limits a lot of the the courses made on the Wii U because if it even includes that, you can't do it. Gotcha. Um, but the kind of bad news about it is you can't search for Wii U courses to download. So you could play Wii U courses if you you you play in the the 100 Mario Challenge or whatever it's called. Okay, where but it's randomized. It's random Wii U things that you're going to be downloading and play playing. Um, but the real draw is that you can create whatever levels you want. You can, uh, StreetPass with people and send them your courses. You can work on a course, give it to someone else. They they work on it. Then someone else can play it.

I am super down for that. Like Nintendo making new levels in Mario 1, Mario 3, Mario World, and New Super Mario Bros. Um, looks and and feels ****. Yeah, sign me the hell up. Um, but yeah, people are kind of upset about the whole lack of being able to search for Wii U games. There's been rumors where, uh, Nintendo made the Super Mario Maker Bookmark website earlier in the year where you can go and like download like using your computer to get, uh, Wii U sites or Wii U courses and find the top ones.

This came out of nowhere. Now I am familiar with Poochie from The Simpsons. MH. Who is Poochy in the Yoshi Universe? He's a dog. Made his appear first appearance in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island on this Super Nintendo. He was in all of the most annoying levels in that game that he's just like the Poochie from The Simpsons, not well designed. Um, he his function would be there'd be spikes that you can't touch, but he could run on top of them. So you kind of get on him and whatever way you're looking, he runs. So okay, yeah, thank you.

We're getting close. Is that that's coming out? Uh, also includes a bunch of stop-motion shorts made in like wool and all that stuff. Uh, yeah, Poochy levels, Poochy amiibos, whatever. But that to me is shocking that they're taking two Wii U games and porting them over to 3DS so late. I think it's a good decision. Like the to get those games because they're both fantastic games into the hands of way, way, way more people because the Wii U, um, base is so much more limited compared to the 3DS. In addition to that, five new StreetPass games for 3DS. Uh, Mario Sports Superstars, which",

There's golf, there's tennis, there's I I don't want the other games. I just want. So, you know, it's going to be dumbed down and and stupid. But the thing is like that sounds like a great NX game to me, you know, like just get all the Super Sluggers and sure. But I mean, that's the whole thing of what you're talking about, right? Don't all these sounds like great, don't all these sound like great NX games? And if the NX can just read DS cartridges, that's why they're still committing and announcing games and putting stuff out right beforehand.

And then the rumor is March is at least the the, um, the NX's supposed date. It's when they give it to you. Um, but then Pikmin, they announced a new Pikmin game for the 3DS that's a 2D scroller that looks awesome. It looks like it uses both of the DS's screens, the top one and bottom one, where you need to kind of interact and use the Pikmin to, uh, kind of look ahead. And it reminds me a lot of the more experimental titles that went on in the Nintendo DS, not 3DS. So it's cool that they're doing that.

We're coming hard with the NX next year. But they didn't, man. They're coming through. Then they talked about Animal Crossing. There's going to be a Mini Direct coming up soon. New set of 50 amiibo cards, a New Leaf update. I'm not really too familiar with Animal Crossing, so I don't really know. But they're talking about Animal Crossing DS or Animal Crossing NX or Animal Crossing the mobile thing. The New Leaf, which I think is the, um, 3DS 3DS game. Okay, cause I'm ready for an Animal Crossing on NX. We should launch with an Animal Crossing on NX. I don't know. I mean, Animal Crossing NX. I want an Animal Crossing NX.

But so weird on the GameCube, cause it was really an online game, right? And it was so weird to try to connect people, bring over and go get your cherries from somebody else. But, uh, I like that game for like one week. I was like, I can't take. See, we played it in the house and that's why it worked. And that's why NX would get me so excited about it. If NX is the remember the device we think it is in in college when we had the GameCube, we all played in the same town there. And that was a lot of fun.

But I'd I'd love that to be around and be prettier and work better and be have a better online construction. Yeah, I I so with with some of this stuff, like it's it's unintuitive in a way, um, because I thought the same thing that they would kind of let things die down because I think that's actually smart business to to, um, kind of quell the storm a little bit and and and calm things and then have a little big pop with NX comes out. But they did say that they were going to support 3DS after NX came out.

The only thing that saved is that the DS was an even better handheld. Um, really, really the greatest Nintendo handheld, I think. Um, I played a little bit of Yoshi's Woolly World at a friend's house and I really liked it actually. It's it's from what I played, it was very easy, but it was it was it was cute and I'm sure it gets harder later. Uh, so I'm excited to see what people think of that game and and and and Mario Maker.

So the the fact of the matter is no one's really interested in Yoshi's Woolly World and I don't I don't know that that's putting on 3DS is necessarily going to change that. I think it will. We'll see. I mean, like, uh, I don't see why I don't understand why a game like Smash would, um, I mean, Smash is a great game, um, or Mario Kart or something like that would sell millions millions of copies on a console with a very small install base, but then Yoshi's Woolly World doesn't sell well on Wii U, but then pushes extra on 3DS doesn't really make any sense.

Um, Mario Maker people have been saying since it was announced like, where is the 3DS version? So I think we we always kind of expected that. And I think it was kind of a miss that they didn't get that out sooner, um, when like the Zeitgeist was still kind of going. But there's always going to be a group of people just like Smash or something like that. They're always playing it. So, um, well, I think the Mario Maker moment has come and gone for mainstream gaming or for, um, console enthusiasts that are moved on to the next thing. I think this will help revive it as well.

So, um, I think that's smart if you're going to release a lot of games and show support of the the handheld, not have it be anecdotal or not have it be kind of just, uh, words coming out of your mouth, but would just really bunch of ****.

Um, people really love Dragon Quest VII and Dragon Quest VIII. And, uh, I think this will similar to what they did with IV, V, and VI on DS back in the day. Um, I think this will get people ready for, you know, X, we're never going to get. And X is an MMO, so who gives a ****. XI. Um, I think it's going to be awesome. And it's going to be on NX. And it's going to be on, um, a few platforms. I think it's on PS4 as well. So, uh, it'll get people ready and hyped up and and and ready to go on those kinds of things as well. Because I really do believe in the Dragon Quest franchise. And and, uh, it's one of the few franchises that have really helped firm with with the exception of X and some spin-offs like, uh, Monsters and stuff that to, uh, really hold firm to what makes I think role-playing games fun, which is for some people, which is the grind, which is the the length,",

And I was reminded of that when I played specifically when I reviewed IX at IGN. I was like, I forgot how fun Dragon Quest could be. So I'm excited for people that haven't played that, never played VII on PS1 or, uh, VIII. I have really no experience with, uh, at all comparably on PS2. I'm excited for those games. Those were the biggest announcements for me. But I understand that in the West, that's not really a Dragon Quest isn't really a thing anymore. So yeah, I'm really impressed by the the Direct overall. It was our first Nintendo Direct in ever really. I mean, at E3, we had the the Zelda thing, but that wasn't so much a Direct as much as it was just gameplay. Sure, here's a stream like a live stream.
