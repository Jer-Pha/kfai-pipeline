You should look into, right? Yeah, they're the best. And then more photos surfaced that he had sent this Las Vegas cocktail girl. Was it wasn't he didn't he have an online persona on some sort of Carlos Danger? Right? He was going by the name Carlos Danger when he was sharing new daughter in Dr. you know, photos in his abs, in his dick and all. You might be asking yourself, huh, what's bad about this? Yeah, well, as I was too, I was like, I don't stay away. This guy's not a national hero. This is hilarious. Except the fact that he's married, married, has a kid.
