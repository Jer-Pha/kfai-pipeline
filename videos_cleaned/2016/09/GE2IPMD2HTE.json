So I think this is a good question. Should we be worried about Mass Effect Andromeda? No, I think that I think, think that they probably wanted to have it out this year, but I also think maybe even earlier. But I think that they've been really coy and weird about it to the to a smart degree where they like, 'We never really showed you anything and we never really dedicated ourselves to a date. We never...' So it's your own expectations. Y'all read into us coming out at E3 and showing concept art and talking about the fact that we were making this and we're going to show you new, which was a mistake, right? But I think based on the original timeline of what they wanted to get the game out, I'm not concerned about it at all. I bet you Mass Effect Andromeda is going to be awesome.

I mean, maybe you didn't like the ending or whatever, but I'm like so stoked about and I the ending I think gives that they definitely got that message loud and clear. So I mean, they're going to come at this one in a way that I think is going to, 'Alright, your choices mean...' I can already, I mean, that's the marketing push when they get there, right? 'New world, new aliens, and your choices mean more than ever and they will carry on through this Trilogy or whatever they want to call this thing. This is going to be all the things we've learned from Mass Effect and Dragon Age put into one game. We're giving you the best RPG we can.'

So I think that's where where a lot of it's coming from. Where where do you guys see more information for this coming out? 'Cause they did say E3. Yeah, I think you'll, I think you'll get a date at E3. Didn't at uh at E3 this year they say something about more information? Yeah, later this year, later this year. But I think I think it's probably a Fall 2017 game and so you'd assume that you drop a teaser trailer at Game Awards come December and then you go out from there. I just forget about The Game Awards.

So in a completely unprecedented move, Andy Cortez just texted me and he says, 'I'm worried about the studio turmoil.' Mhm. I don't know much about what's going on. What, BioWare Edmonton or no, Montreal's making it, right? Yeah, I don't I don't know what's going on because people left. I'm gonna call Andy Cortez. Casey Hudson left a while. I know exactly. Andy Cortez, you know all about studio turmoil because I hear you starting shit at Rooster Teeth left and right. That's right. I heard him and Barb don't like each other. Just something I heard.

So Aaryn Flynn, who I guess runs whatever studio it is there that's doing Mass Effect, they mentioned that there's been like that it hasn't necessarily been the easiest process. And I know that some it kind of reminded me of what was going on with Uncharted 4. Obviously that didn't matter because that game was fucking awesome. But there's just been a lot of people in and out, sort of coming and going. And Aaryn Flynn kind of said, 'Yeah, it hasn't been easy, but we're we're sort of roughing through it.' So I don't know. Yeah, I think I don't know. It sounds to me like some maybe a smart thing to say to kind of explain like, 'Well, it's been a it's hard to make a game and we know you want it.

So speaking of Mass Effect, this reminded me of a journey I once went on and I've never told this story on show. Oh my God. So I'm going to tell it right now. Okay, Colin, do you do you know my history with the Mass Effect franchise goes a little something like this. A game called Mass Effect 3 was coming out and it was weeks away from release. So they were like, 'You know what we're going to do? We need some promotion for this. So we're going to send some copies of this motherfucker to space 'cause that's thematically relevant.' I remember this. So they attached copies of Mass Effect 3 to weather balloons and sent them up. I remember this. And you and you had to go and find you were sent to find one.

He was a little dog back then. What do you know about wind? Was the quote that I that I said. He was like, 'I I I know a fair amount about wind.' I was like, 'Okay, good.' He blows it out his ass. I was like, 'What do you know about weather balloons and if one was launched in S.F. could we find it and track it?' And he's just like, 'I think we could find a way.' And I was like, 'I love you, Kevin. We're doing this thing.' So of course I hit up my boy Alfredo. I'm like, 'Yo, we're in this.' However, I was interning at the time at IGN. Alfredo not related IGN at all. He just hung out all the time and everyone thought he worked there. The best kept secret of IGN. Alfredo didn't actually work there for a long time.",

And I'm like, 'So Mr. Nick, um I would like to go chase down some space treasure. Is that cool?' And he's like, 'Yeah, you don't. Fredo can do it. Just don't hurt yourselves.' I'm like, 'Alright, great.' So Kevin, me and Alfredo strap ourselves with GoPros and we're like, 'We're doing this shit.' And we hunt this damn game down and we went on a crazy adventure that's all documented on IGN.com. You can find the video if you search for Mass Effect Space Hunt. You competing against Destin Legarie too? Well, it wasn't so much competing as much as it's so we're driving and uh we went to the launch was at near Baker Beach, right?

A lot of signals are coming through and we're like hunting this thing down and it's like we knew where it was going. We knew the trajectory and Kevin knows all about wind. So we knew the direction. We're going, 'Alright, we're heading towards Santa Cruz.' So we started driving to Santa Cruz and I'm in my 1994 Toyota Corolla and let me tell you what, Greg, that car seen some shit. And this day, no different. It was going straight through the shit fields and I was like, 'We're going shit hard. We are ride or dying on this shit.' And we were probably going to die.

I was like, 'Oh shit, we need to make a U-turn too.' So I do a U-turn. Then I notice the car behind me does a U-turn and the car behind that. And almost said, I'm like, 'Holy shit, every single car in this lane is chasing this weather balloon.' Then all of a sudden it turns into that shit. We all realize it. And then it's like all of a sudden this game turned us into animals and we're all driving on the wrong side of the street. I literally off-roaded in my 1994 Toyota Corolla, which was all that was the death of that car, by the way. That was the final straw that thing had.

And there's all these guys and I'll never forget the reason I'm bring up this story. We spent an entire day with this guy that ran PR for Mass Effect. He quit shortly after. I've never seen someone more stressed and upset and like he just immediately was like, 'This was the dumbest idea of all fucking time.' How how far out of from launch was this? Uh it was a week before the game came out. Okay, that's interesting because I think I had the game like three weeks before it came out. So why were you guys even doing this?

So Eric Harts from IGN was really worried 'cause he thought we were like dead. Yeah, 'cause me, Alfredo and Kevin at the time, he didn't even know. We're just out there in the wilderness, man. It was some bad times. There's some scary shit. Anyway, Destin goes in the middle of the night and finds it, uh 'cause he could see the blip of the light when it was dark.

I have uh the the walkie-talkie that the guy threw down and broke 'cause he was like, 'Fuck this.' The I was like, 'I'm getting some treasure from this.' Yeah, two things I want to add. One, first time I ever was a cameraman, the footage unusable. It was un- not much has changed. All right, moving forward from this, we got one from our boy Jake James Lugo. He says, 'I want to hear about games that helped everyone out through a very rough time in life. Something that get us back on our feet.'

I mean, but I have a hard time focusing on games when I'm upset actually. So I I don't really play I don't play games when I'm like in a bad place. That's just me though. Uh I mean, I've written about it. It's one of my most famous IGN articles, right? Of playing through the pain. And it was about Infamous when I got super into Infamous when I was going through my divorce. Uh but that's played out. I've said that a million times.

So it was like just a little too cold and sitting there playing Road Rash was great. Bring back Road Rash.

But yeah, I mean, I think the difference with the with Drake and the reason that I'm like definitely know is because those the Subway things were more Uncharted commercials, whereas like these other characters could be. Don't I don't think they'll hit that, but I'm saying like that's the closest equivalent I think we have this day. Yeah, because I don't I don't really think that there is at all. Um let's see.

Obviously, we had that Beyond skin for the PlayStation. Yeah, that I have on the that's cool that I have that on the PS3 still.
