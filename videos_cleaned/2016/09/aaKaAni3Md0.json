Now that's that's rare though for YouTube to be honest. But this was like this was like Ghostbusters movie level. This was Call of Duty Advanced Warfare trailer level you know both of which deserved all their hate. But I mean for this then I stopped and thought about it. I'm like is there any redeeming qualities about this? Now I want to get your guys's initial thoughts on it. And is there a bright side at all? Yeah of course there is. I I'm a big Metal Gear fantasy.

Fuck Konami. I'm going to jump on that bandwagon. Why are they doing this? Why are they moving? This is not Metal Gear. I do not want a co-op game. I do not want a zombie game. That's not why I play Metal Gear. But then Danny O'Dwyer popped up on Twitter and was like man this is some sour grapes bullshit. You all don't want them at all tarnishing the legacy of Metal Gear.

Why is Konami making another Metal Gear game? Because they own it and they want to make money off of it. That's the thing is like am I really allowed to sit here and from a trailer be so negative to it? Gameplay at all? Be so negative. And it was like because it's just they're not even calling Metal Gear Solid right? They're calling it Metal Gear. They're like we're doing something different here and we're going to use this franchise. Do I think it's a right move? No. What I want to see them do with it is stop. Just stop making Metal Gear.

You know that's the problem there is that they have no incentive to stop making their biggest game franchise. You know it's like it doesn't make any sense. Like Kojima being gone. I'm sure they're not happy about that overall in terms of the quality of their games and like what that means. And especially with all the shit that they have to deal with now. But from a business perspective unless they're totally going to just stop the whole gaming side which isn't that far out of their future. Yeah. Triple A gaming. Yeah. Why would they? Until they back out Triple A gaming they have one of the biggest Triple A games in the franchises. Why not continue in some way? So that's the whole thing is like I don't believe this is the right.

So let me let me ask you a question there. So that's what I see the trailer and I was just like God this is disaster written all over it. The redeeming qualities to me are Fox Engine. I love how Metal Gear Solid 5 plays. Sure. More game set in that. Cool. Like another like Ground Zero's style thing. Cool. I'm fine with that. My argument to that or not even argument. My my my my I'm going to poke a hole in it and not just be a fanboy. That is like well how much did you like Metal Gear Online? How much Metal Gear Online that you play? None. Yeah. Yeah. That's the whole thing. Is this going to be like a Peace Walker thing or is it going to be like a Metal Gear Online thing? Well it looks like it's gonna be Metal Gear Online.

I mean that's the thing is I'm just trying to look at the few things that I do like about it. And that is the engine and the gameplay of it. Because when the moment you go out of that you look at it it's like the biggest issue for me is that it looks like Resident Evil Raccoon City outbreak or whatever it was called. But it also kind of looks like the aesthetic of the Resident Evil movies which is not a compliment. You know it definitely it has a vibe of like all right we're taking Metal Gear but really there's nothing to do with Metal Gear at all. And I think at least that's a good thing right? There at least they're like all right there's a weird portal. See it's funny that you say that's a good thing. And it is the silver lining.

We all walk that line of being fans and being industry pundits or insiders wherever the hell we are of. I understand the business decision. I think they're doing it in the best way they can of trying to get around it. But it's still like it's so obviously let's cash in on the Metal Gear name. It's so obvious. Let's keep going. And I can't fault them for it. When Colin dies I'm still going to call it Colin and Greg Live. I'll just find another Colin or I'll rename Nick. It's easy. Yeah it is pretty easy. So okay that leads me to my bigger point here is looking at the what Konami could have done. What could the future of Metal Gear been? Because the options I see are don't ever make another Metal Gear. Sure. Which is not really plausible. You're a business remake. One of the other ones. Sure. Which is offensive",

Which is offensive then to Kojima's legacy and everything else. Continue the storyline which everybody would figure out about as well. Do a spinoff that is canon or do something like this that is as different as it can be while still being part of it. I mean for me if I was this if I'm at Konami Kojima walks. It's a huge PR nightmare inside gaming. Because that's the whole thing right? It was like we always talk about this. Our core audience you watching this show right now. Of course I pointed to the camera because I'm doing soliloquy thinking that it would be on me. But Kevin's over there fucking trying to find all the salsa he can.

What would their Metal Gear look like? Because then it is the best of both worlds in a way of creator that our core audience what we believe in understands and gets excited about. And then what the mass consumer who's a Metal Gear fan and has no idea that Hideo Kojima is connected to this thing what they think out of it. The thing there all those people right?

No. Does that make it wrong? No. I think what's so crazy about it is how unexpected it was. None of us thought it was going to come this soon this way. Like here's a trailer. It's happening. Whatever. And now that they had to do a little bit of damage control because a lot of people like fuck this. And then they came out like it's not a $60 game. Oh I didn't see this. I haven't heard.

Beautiful table with like Revengeance and didn't do too well. Critically did fine but in terms of sales it didn't do well at all.

And even Infamous was the same way of like, here's the standalone piece of content you're going to get to get back into New Marais and have a different spin on it. You know what's interesting?

They did this to Koji Igarashi too. So, you know, and they really like shit on Castlevania and gave it to a studio that didn't deserve it. And so I feel like the right move for Konami as a publisher would actually be to go to a franchise like Contra, I think, and ignore these other things that they've kind of ruined and find someone to work on it with, like work on that game. The thing is, is that you're not. And this point was made is that they're really going to be unable to make any sort of attract any sort of talent.

Speaking of IGN at Gamescom, Final Fantasy 15 director Hijami Tabata explained that a hefty day one patch was originally in store for the game.

But at that point, I learned there are maybe a lot of people out there who play in an offline environment and don't have internet. When I found that out, thinking about it again, I'm glad I didn't make that decision. It would take about one month exactly to fit everything we wanted in the day one patch into the disc version. And with that, pretty much all the technical issues would be sorted out. And then we thought that after we got that technical base down, there were no problems there. It's one more month to polish everything up and get it really great. And that's why it was two months.

As for what specifically the team is working on, Tabata said the game is basically complete but needs extra polish due to the sheer amount of content included. The main thing there is working on fixing the bugs which affect the visuals of the game, polishing that up and doing the final optimization push. The other thing I think we can get much closer to that perfect game balance in the final balancing period as well to make it a game that's really fun and easy and comfortable to play for any kind of player.

Then they put out the platinum demo and honestly I didn't like that. Like I thought it was way too slow. You way too effortless like where you're just doing things and there wasn't a lot of thought put into it which is the opposite of what I enjoy about Final Fantasy. I love the battle systems to keep me on my toes and not just have me constantly doing the same thing over and over. I want to have to switch between things I get early on in the game RPGs you're going to just keep hitting attack and that's all that matters. But I want more from that.

It's just like I don't know like I find that the narrative drive of a lot of these games with it when you're playing it to be way more interesting than you know than the ending most of the time. And I also feel like to Greg's point I think it's true. Like there are times where I'm just like I just need to be done with this. Like I don't want to play this game anymore whether or not whether it was frustrating me or whether I've spent 40 hours with it. I just want to be done with it. Like you just want to get to the end and be like OK it's over. You know Cooney's ending was really good though. There are certain games that have good or great endings.

I think that I think the controllers are way more interesting. Yeah. And and but even then, I don't care. I don't look at my piece where I'm not like staring at it all day. You know, so it's so it's not for me. I think the cooler things are like the old retro consoles that people go back and make the people are fucking around a lot with the NES specifically. And I think there's some cool stuff being done there. But in terms of contemporary consoles, like the ones sold out of a box from a brick and mortar or an online merchant or whatever, I don't it doesn't do it for me. I like them. It's rare that it would ever make me go do it. 0th anniversary PlayStation was the one that I tried to get. But like the Batman one, I didn't",

One of the PAX is in the last calendar year where we went to and they had that. Remember this custom Fallout PC they had, Kev, where it was like all rusted out and had the vault text symbol on it. You can open it up. That was fucking awesome. That shit's cool. I have a he talked about stickers. I have, you know, my Xbox One decked out in a flaming toast sticker. That's all Mizzou stuff. Like, that's cool. It's not like a huge deal to me, but I thought the Xbox One was ugly and want to do something different with it. When we did, we're still working at IGN, obviously.

That's cool that I have that on the PS3 still. And the one thing I like from contemporary kind of consoles is the stickers that we put over the over the touch pad on the PS4. Oh, yeah. This toasty is a Kinda Funny logo. One of them has a team fat like logo on it. So I like that. But it's it's not very important to me. I just want the functionality. It can be like I said before, it can be a cardboard box. Yeah, I will go do like the full toasty sticker skin like that will go over the entire control. I like controllers look simple and I like how it accentuated on the PS4 with the touch pad and the light bar. Yeah.

It wasn't even a thing. Like when we were young, it wasn't even a thing. N64, as far as I remember, was the first console that ever really had any option to do anything to it. So many recently I saw a picture from people that I think they were in Germany and there was this like store that had every single N64 that ever came out. And it's crazy. They're all next to each other and had every peripheral that came with it or was sold with it because remember N64 like it had that the color line at some point. And it was the system.

I loved the purple one that like the C3 purple one that they had come with the system. That was my control. I was like, fuck you. You ain't playing with that one. The Pokemon Snap, I think console. I think that was what it was. The yellow. No, Pokemon. Hey, you, Pikachu. Oh, hey, you, Pikachu. Yeah, that's what it was. I remember that one being like, I was like, that's kind of cool. Remember the blue one? Hey, you, Pikachu. Yeah, I do. Unfortunately. That was a game. They experimented a couple of times with Pokemon on N64 like in an interesting way.

Ladies and gentlemen, that has been episode 83 of the Kinda Funny Games cast. As always, I'm Tim Gettys. Those are the coolest dudes in video games and here we all are together.
