They're like, \"What are business meetings? Have no fun. Perfect. That's what we want. Nailed it.\" Demos, but their tech demos. God, it. That reminded me like the duck, remember the duck? Oh, Super Rub 'a' Dub. P. Yeah, Super Rub 'a' Dub, the game. Yeah, that was a thing. All I did, the only thing I saw from it really was like, I tuned in for like the Mass Effect, uh, demo. Mass Effect looks good. It looks really good. And then when right when it got exciting, they stopped it. They're like, \"Things are about to explode!\" And then they're like, \"Cool, that's it.

Uh, and it might have already, while we've been doing this, maybe it's been confirmed, denied, one way or the other. Mhm. It sounded like the guy in Mass Effect was Nolan North. Oh, playing a little bit younger and a little bit less Nathan Drake. Could be 100% wrong.

And everybody was like, \"What does that mean?\" And and there's all this speculation about what it was. And then nothing. I no one never really talked about it again. I don't think it's been revealed what it would have been. But then I I saw, I when I heard him today, what I thought was him today, because we're listening off speakers off the thing. Maybe I'm totally wrong and it's not him at all. We have a 50-50 shot. Yeah, it's either him or Troy. So, well, it wasn't Troy. I have a pretty good ear for everybody.

And then Greg told me that was that was a game and an indie film that was squashed together. Say the way you're saying it again. Deus. Deus Ex. It might be Deus Ex. I mean, now you say it and like he says it and he knows a whole bunch of random facts. It could be Deus. You say Deus. Is there anyone that we can like figure this out? Yeah, I'm sure we have friends that work on the game. Get get on it. Anyways, while Greg's doing that, yeah, I want I want kind of to do a review discussion of this game. You know, you know how we, I don't know if you knew this, Nick, but we do reviews over here. Yeah, games. I want to know, should people play this? What do you think about it?

Um, I enjoyed it a lot and a lot more than I thought I was going to, uh, given that my first couple Let's Plays and experiences with it looked somewhat like, um, a child trying to hunt a boar. It was just I got slaughtered every single time. Um, but what I have to what you got to remember, say it your way. Deus. Deus. Like Deus or Deus, right? Okay. Like Deus. Not Deus. It's Deus. Or Deus.

And then you just start to feel like a God and it's super fun. Um, but that that's that's kind of the it's kind of one of the reasons why I like the game is, you know, uh, you get the opportunity to go about things multiple ways, right? You can you can take all the enemy as head-on if you want, bottleneck them and take them out one by one one. And you're going to, you know, you're going to go down in life.

You know, there's all sorts of different ways you can go about things. And I and I love that freedom in this game. Um, it's one of the reasons why I I was drawn to Human Revolution originally, just because I like the style of it. And I was like, \"Oh, I want to kind of, you know, every once in a while I'll jump into a game that I know I'm going to be in for like, you know, 10 to 20 hours.\" Um, largely, I usually play games in about four to 5 hours 'cause I have the attention span kind of of a like a gnat.

You have to go through all the emails and all the pocket secretaries and all everything you can find in the world adds to this grand story that they're telling.\" Um, and you know, I think Greg was correct in assuming that that would completely just baffle me and that I would lose like lose, you know, attention. It it was always such an, you know, you're always you play like, maybe I'm not it's not joking like an insult. You play like three or four meaty games a year, right?

So you can actually right when it starts, it asks you if you want to do the new control scheme or the Human Revolution scheme. And pick the new one. It's it's much better. Uh, largely because I think, uh, if I remember correctly, in Human Revolution, you had to click in one of the sticks to aim. And that was the worst. Now it takes a little getting used to.

Sure.

Um, you never really see these guys again until maybe like, I don't know, six, seven hours into the game. So you can't really remember what's going on. And then you are set up as working for war or or one organization. And you're a sleeper in another organization trying to get to a third organization that may or may not be a good organization.

You're actually invested in. But the actual story itself, I feel like could have been told in a slightly more concise way. And that's again, just for me, because again, I have the attention span of a three-year-old. Um, I need I like the idea of the three-hour story that plays out over five hours, not the two-hour story or three-hour story that plays over over 20 hours.

I'm going to play this game.\" And I just got hella into it for no reason. So I'm just going to go out on a limb and assume that you don't remember, uh, Mankind Divided or Human Revolution that much. I don't think I beat Human Revolution either. So I I think I played probably about 80% of it, but I don't remember ever actually beating that game. So so you kind of answered the question I was about to ask. But do you think you need to have played that one to enjoy this one from a story? Or yes, if you want the full story, yes, because it",

Awesome. And and the thing now here's where it gets better. You ready for it, Tim? Mhm. Vita, PlayStation 4, Steam. We I was going to ask where are the Vita games? Yeah, exactly. No, no. Now I I harassed the YIIK creator the time online. He's been delayed recently because of some stuff with his mom. So we hope everything's going all all right with that.

And that that was the thing is this is now I can't talk about the first one I believe but this is now the second iOS game I've seen in as many weeks where I'm like I would actually play that. One day I'll tell you about the other one. This one gets a shout out. It's already out. Came out today. Uh Project Highrise. Basically you're building a high-rise.

Uh this is a game I had backed personally on Kickstarter. Uh what I liked about it was I was watching I believe what's his face, yeah, masquerade or whatever and Kevin came back around. He's like, hey, you remember that Apartment game? I'm like, yeah. And he's like, it's around the corner. It looks completely different. And we went over there and the it looks better.

Like it's really really well done in terms of what the character models are, what the environments are going to look like, how it all interacts. And what I found interesting about it from just watching it for a little bit is that it's got its own language. And so you're playing and doing things and running into other characters and then it pops on the screen and it's all gibberish. You can't read any of it. And then it's yes or no. And so it's like trying to go through and you're making these choices that I assume you are going to influence who does what with you or how it all works out.
