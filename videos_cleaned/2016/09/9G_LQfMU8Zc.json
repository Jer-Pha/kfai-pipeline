Final topic is mine and it comes from patreon.com kinda funny where Aiz gave us money to get his topic read and he says, when is it okay to let go of friends or bad breakups between friends? So when is it okay to let go of a bad friend? I think is basically what he's saying. When is it okay to end a friendship? How do you know when it's time to end a friendship? This is a a very dark question. It is, you know, because things can get pretty real with it. Yeah, I I think in my experience you got to really give, you don't have to, but I think that you should give your best shot more than three strikes. Like I think it's like you really got to just keep trying and if they're your friend and if they're that close to you they're there for a reason and they've deserved that for whatever it is even if they were just family and given to you",

One day there will be a Breaking Point and you will clearly know that they are past the point of being helped. They don't want to be helped and it is only going to make things worse for you, the people you love, and them. Sure, that is the point where you can kind of give up on them and let them go. I still don't think you should push them away. It's more about just letting them go and that's the thing is like let letting everybody letting the drift apart happen right where you're not trying to re somebody in and saying wait something no no no we used to be closer and we should fix this or just being like this isn't working out or whatever we're not on the same page because that happened to me in high school with a bunch of kids",
