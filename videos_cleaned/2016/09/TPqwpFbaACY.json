Um, he's partnered with a, I think a Chinese publisher, publisher, and originally it was going to be free-to-play, and I think that they saw the writing on the wall and like, we can't do this.

It's not a healthy market when you're not willing to put a price on the game. It's not, I don't think a healthy thing for the gamer, and I don't think it's a healthy thing for the studio or for the development team or the publisher or anyone involved, because you don't have a, you don't have any skin in the game. And since there's no point, uh, there's no price point in a to access the game, then why are you ever going to like really give it a fair shake? Um, Kill Strain, I think was ill-advised from multiple angles. It's a MOBA when there's way too many MOBAs. It's a reactionary MOBA, and it's a console free-to-play game. Just seems like a strange thing for a first party to do when they could have probably looked at and garnered third-party data and not done that to that team, that very talented team that made the game. But I, I, I also feel like with Drawn to Death, it's the same thing that happened with Kill Strain. They showed the game way too often. They made the game way too accessible. They, yeah, if you want to play these games, you can go get into them right now, right? By going to DrawnToDeath.com. You can go there and get your code and start playing.

Yeah, I mean that would have been, I mean that would have been outrageous. Took me, it took me five seconds to know that this game wasn't anywhere near a 10.

No, oh, he says with PSVR so close to launch, I need to discuss a few things. Please stick with me. The UK has been poor at giving people the opportunity to demo PSVR, so I have based my pre-order mainly on feedback from you guys. You're welcome, Paul. The cost of the device has had me saving for a while and I still have no VR games on pre-order. I trust you guys so I would appreciate if you could recommend a solid starting game to buy for VR. Rigs does seem to be the one with the most hype behind it but I just don't know if it's going to be for me... Also... I already own the PS4 camera but didn't we start off this whole PSVR sell by saying that Move controllers were optional and not a requirement now?",

I was thinking the PlayStation Worlds might be a nice place to start with VR but then I need to fork out, I think it means fork out, an extra then he puts a weird upside down J with a line through it, 70 70 Pence, I assume, 70 70p for Move controllers. I am left feeling slightly confused by VR and its requirements. I don't really know which games I can get without needing Move controllers and why are Sony not telling us much about the Cinematic Mode? I have a feeling this isn't going to be this isn't going to be very good and that playing standard games on VR will suffer from screen door, the screen door effect. Thanks for all the great content.

This is tip of the sword VR stuff though. You're going to get out there, you're going to get your headset, you're going to get your demo disc, you're going to play all those demos and be like, those were fun experiences. They're not full games yet. Even if you buy Rigs, if you buy Batman, I feel like you're going to tap out pretty quick on that. Let alone, yeah, you do need to figure out who needs Move controllers, what is going on. We, Colin, have been excited from what we've seen of PlayStation VR. I'm totally in.

But how many great games am I going to have out the gate? This sounds very much like the hype of No Man's Sky we were just talking about. I think you do need to sit there and figure out from reviews and things if you're in for that experience on day one or if you need to wait and see, hey, here's what this is going to be. Yeah, I uh don't know if I necessarily disagree. I think it's going to be a slow burn. I think that you have to just figure these things out.

I I do feel like uh we're excited about PSVR because of the promise of PSVR. And so um it might not work out this year or next year or whatever but it's going to stick around, I do believe. And um I think you're going to find worthwhile experiences. I mean the experience of, you know, I'm excited to play EVE: Valkyrie. I'm excited to play some of these other games.

I I think that you'll find um, you know, may maybe you want to cancel it until you and get it later. I'm sure it's not going to be that hard to find soon after. Yeah, of course. After launch, I would say what I would say two, three weeks, you'd imagine. Yeah, they'll start they'll start, you know, manufacturing more and I'm sure they already are manufacturing as many as they can and and we'll see what happens.

We're talking about the investment here of the headset and you've been saving your money for a while but then like, do you need Move controllers? If you're not down to buy the Move controllers, are you down for the experience of VR? Because for me that is what VR is like. Yeah, you don't need them for certain experiences but the reaching out and grasping the gauntlets and putting them on your hand as Batman, throwing a Batarang, like that's what I right now think VR is and what it's going to be.

I think for some experiences I'm going to want to play games like that, just normal games, have it all cut off and just be there in the theater. What's more interesting is I think I was thinking about this on the way here to work today, why aren't we talking about VR more, period? We're less than a month away from the launch of PlayStation VR and I really feel like I forget that all the time. It doesn't feel like it's imminent. It doesn't feel like it's about to happen.

I mean, so the the big thing that I want to say is that Red Dead Revolver um its trophies popped. Um talking about the PS2 game from like 2004. Um it has uh 11 bronze, one silver and one gold.

And Ice 7 wrote into KindaFunny.com/PSQ just like you can and says, hello Colin and Greg. Hello. He said he asked me to wait so good job. I was just browsing PSN Profiles when I noticed Red Dead Revolver's trophies just went live. Having been a huge fan of Red Dead Redemption and never having played Revolver, this seems like a PS2 classic I'd want to try. It does however leave me with two questions. Number one, is this another piece of evidence pointing to Red Dead 3 coming soon? More of Rockstar cashing in on the love of their old games or some mix of both? Two, more importantly, does Colin stand by his prediction of Red Dead 3 in 2016 or is it too late now? Thank you for all the content you make my long commutes more tolerable. XOXO Eric. Number",

Thank you for all the content you make my long commutes more tolerable. XOXO Eric. Number one, is this more evidence of Red Dead 3 coming? No, you don't think so? No, not simply because the Sony or Rockstar has supported the PS4 to or PS2 to PS4 stuff more than even Sony itself has. So I don't I don't necessarily look at it like that. I mean, Bully, the Grand Theft Auto, like everything is on PS4 right now. Uh The Warriors. Like so this just seems like another Rockstar game. Yeah, could it be a, you know, some sort of harbinger? Maybe. But I I don't necessarily read it like that considering Rockstar's traditional support of releasing their classic games on PlayStation platforms. Just do that. Um if this was the first game that they released on there that that that would be so. But when we read the top 10 list as we just did from the digital store, we it's all Rockstar games.

They're making money, they're moving units, why not? Uh that said, Red Dead Red Dead 3 certainly is coming. Um and do you are you seeing by prediction of this year? It's getting too late now. I I I think it could happen if it's announced by the end of September. Otherwise, I think that probably not. Um so where do you think that puts it? Spring, summer, fall next year? No idea. Yeah, no idea. You know, uh I think really seeing it, I think really seeing it in the in the Q1 would be weird. Yeah, uh Q2 would make a little more sense. I I think you might want to hold it to to to Q3 or Q4. Okay, back to your trophies. Oh, okay. Mafia 3's trophies are up. Mafia 3's uh 50. Does anyone have it yet by the way?

Fish Got to Eat says he helped Vito capture Michael Greco. Um It's A Brave New World, you turn the butcher over to Burke. So there's all these kinds of trophies that are story driven. And now because of the nonlinear nature of Mafia 3 in terms of like there are things you can see, there are things you cannot see, there are people you can portray that affect the storyline. I wonder if you can get all these trophies in one playthrough. Um but there's that. Then you get into kind of the meat. Uh Sure Thing Boss is you unlocked all the associates. Um you complete all the side missions for Burke, for Vito, for Cassandra. Those are your partners that you can meet. Um and Vito is from Mafia 2. Um",

And that's one of the cool things is the earn and how they use that in Mafia. The I'm really excited about that. Um and then there's trophies. Uh there's trophies that seem to conflict. It says We're In This Together, kept all underbosses alive until Yet Here We Are. And then Just You And Me, keep only one underboss alive until Yet Here We Are. So this again sounds like a game you might have to play twice for all the trophies. Um you can uh The New Boss, flipped 16 racket bosses. Live Another Day, recruited 15 racket informants. No Loose Ends, killed all of the racket bosses. Can't Trust A Rat, killed 15 racket informants. Um how much longer do we have to 3? It's an October.",

Um so there's a lot of trophies. There's 50 bronzes as they said. Um and the silver trophy. So there's four silver trophies and a gold trophy. The silver, right? Is that right? Yep. Four silver trophies. So the silver trophies are um Burn Like Napalm, Certainly Was Exciting, and Yet Here We Are, which are all story driven trophies. And then the final silver trophy is Real Nice Time. Um which is another so kind of spoilery kind of thing here.
