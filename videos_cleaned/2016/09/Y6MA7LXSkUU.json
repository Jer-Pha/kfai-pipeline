I mean, I would, I wouldn't, I wouldn't care if it existed or not, but people clearly do. Yeah, that's the thing is I I think uh, yeah, I think do they have a, is there a point to them existing? Yeah, I mean, I think it is that we, you know, we are an industry that doesn't talk uh, to each other enough and doesn't celebrate the good enough and it does appear to be negative all the time. So to have one place that is the show for the most part, 'cause there's GDC Awards and there's E3 stuff and there's Judges Week and then there's every site doing their own little thing. To have one place that is, hey, everybody come together for one night and watch this because even if you're going to watch it and **** hate talk about it, you're watching it and you're communicating. And to Geoff Keighley's credit, I, you know, and again, full disclosure, like we're friends with Geoff, you know what I mean? Whatever. Like I think every year",

I think every, I think he do, I think he does care. I think, you know, Geoff is a legit gamer and a legit dude and I think he does take it every year of like, they didn't like this, they didn't like this. I think getting away from Spike was a huge move of, okay, cool, now I can make the show I want to make. Year after, you know what, two years now in a row of doing it on his own, getting to see what it looks like and how it goes. I think it is a good thing. Does it matter? No, it could get blinked away tomorrow and like industry wouldn't be rocked to its core or something. But it is a cool place to debut a cool trailer and talk about an announcement and then sit here and go, hey, we like these people and we're going to honor them.

And it still is too that the board is made up of people from IGN and GameStop and all or GameSpot and all these different, you know, you know, sites that have an editorial voice. That's cool. Yeah, exactly. I I don't think it needs to happen. I don't think a lot of things need to happen, but I think that it show need to happen. This show doesn't need to happen, definitely. But I think that it it's very good to have and I think that it gives video games uh a level of credibility, not in the like journalistic way, but just in the the sense of like these matter. Like we can talk about these in the same way we can talk about music and movies um to mainstream people. Like The Game Awards last year when you won, I showed a lot of my friends that video and they were blown away. They're like, whoa, that stage. Like that can't look like a real thing.

Like Greg Miller's winning award for being the trending gamer, which means what, you know? But then, but when you when you think about it though, it's like that it's explaining that type of stuff though. It's teaching people that, oh, story in a game is something that deserves an award. Oh, soundtrack is something that video games have, you know? And it's I feel like we all know that, right? But it's about the people that don't. And I think that for the uses out there, they give us trailers. Like The Game Awards has been fantastic about debuting stuff. The Last of Us debuted there. And it's like, where else is it going to? Batman. Like uh, The Game Awards now are like, that's something I'm looking forward to at the end of the year.",

There's very few things every year now that we get a whole bunch of announcements and where you're expecting surprises. The only other thing is E3. Yeah, besides that, it's like Gamescom, TGS, PSX. Like all the conferences of which now there's one every single month. You can kind of expect what we're going to get from all of those. But The Game Awards, you're expecting some big reveal. You're expecting Nintendo to be there. You're expecting Kojima to do something that's awesome. And you figure it's exposure too, right? I mean, for as many people as us doing a Let's Play of uh Emily is Away or Her Story or something, there's millions that have no idea what the **** that thing is.

No, man, I I think it's very, very good and I think that the direction, like you said, every year gets better and better. Like you got to work out the kinks. Things are never perfect the first round. And you know, with especially with Geoff Keighley, he gets so much hate for being this kind of overproduced guy, but I think that he is really guiding the ship when it comes to overproduced stuff in our industry, which allows us to do this **** and like have it be the weird mix of production mixed with shenanigans, you know?
