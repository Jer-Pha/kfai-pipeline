TT Games, you've been there for 30 years. Well, oh, the wrong direction. Of course, TT makes all LEGO games. We do. We, you make all my dreams come true when you do this 'cause I, you know, I love LEGO Dimensions, and you've brought a whole bunch of what is it, Series 6 now? Year Two, Year Dimension, Season Two, Year Two. Um, yeah, and this stuff which is coming September the 7th, the first sort of wave, first. Yeah, the Harry Potter Team Pack, the the Ghostbusters. Kevin, give me, give me your close-up zoom you were so proud of over here. All right, Kevin, there you go. See, wish you could see it. I can, I can see it off your screen. You did a really good job with it. There's this is Lord Voldemort. He's bad. You don't say his name. This is Harry. Now you might at home say, \"Shouldn't this Team Pack be a Level Pack?\" I say, \"Yeah, yeah, it should.\" Huh? You're making me",

You're making me wait for Fantastic Beasts, which I appreciate, but I wish it was there right now. Of course, yeah, but don't forget, yeah, that very, very soon around the corner there's the PS4 Harry Potter Collection Remaster. All right, you see it? Yeah, I see what you're doing. Thanks for that leading there. No problem. Yeah, I left the net open, you kicked it right in. How many Platinum Trophies in that now? Am I getting two for each game or is it one for one now? Oh, good question. Yeah, you don't know anything. I don't know when will TT Games hire a Trophy Consultant, is what I'm saying. I, I will, I will freelance my services for you. I asked Steven Sharples to do it. Yeah, I asked him to do it. Dang it, Sharples! Uh, so here we go, we're playing through the Ghostbusters Story Pack right now.

That's the portal for three years,\" I think is what you promised, not having to do anything about it. That was the promise. But this Year Two, you've introduced Story Packs now, like the Ghostbusters Story Packs, which are meatier experiences that then come with the abil-- wait, hold on, Kevin. Give me the, give, hold on, don't do it yet. Now do it. Okay, meatier experiences that come with a new way to design. Yeah, right, Kevin, look at that, huh?

I was afraid after Year One you were going to back off it, you weren't going to do so much. And then here you go, Green Arrow. Kevin, give me the one of Green Arrow. Stop eating your French fries, tots, Tater Tots. I'm sorry. There's Green Arrow. Now don't move it, Kevin. All right. And then here's Supergirl.

First off, I'm going to turn her head on. Kevin, give me the punch-in on her. We're going to, \"I don't like being angry!\" There we go. Well, that's it. Yeah, 'cause she has Red Lantern abilities.

You're just going to just go straight there and just completely mash it up. Exactly. Well, you know, \"Break the the rules,\" I believe is what they, a friend of mine once told me. #BreakTheRules. Exact. #BreakTheRules. Yeah, uh, so I'm, I'm just going to go straight in and do, uh, do this rift, which is, um, the new, um, sort of, uh, it's the new portal mechanic. Every, every Story Pack comes with two new portal mechanics. So you got all the cool ones from last year, but then each, uh, each Story Pack has two new ones. So this is one of them here. So I, I'm Abby. So if I go and put her on there, uh, she's going to go and basically go to the same place in a different sort of portion of time. Okay, you're still there.",

You can just go and do your thing. I'll do my. You want me to jump through the hole or no? I don't. No, you. Now I just get to smash up this place. Yeah, you can just do your thing. Um, but it's one of those mechanics that that again encourages play with the portal. Um, it's something we really wanted to to stay true to. So, um, you know, the Ghostbusters team, uh, 'cause Jimmy directed this. Uh, you've met Jimmy, my my co-game director. Um, looks a lot like Phil Collins. It looks a lot like Phil Collins.

But he's all the way over there across the pond, as they say. He's not going to come over here. No, well, no, he he doesn't fly or travel very often. Yeah, the way I understand the rules of engagement. Did you really? How would you? Do you promise him something? I, yeah, he he was, he was on a promise. Yeah, uh, no, yeah, he just, we we very rarely get to go out for, uh, a social event. So, um, it was nice to be able to do that. Uh, that's probably the best place to leave it 'cause we had a few wild nights. Oh, yeah, yeah, you tied one on. But we were working hard. Sure you were. Right?

Um, now I forget, is that a new thing? I don't remember last year having. I had in the Ghostbusters, didn't you? So I think I, you, the Ghostbusters, as in the original Ghostbusters Pack, had that. And so we've in Year Two, because we've tried to make Year Two, um, bigger and better in every way, that's one of the things we we've really focused on.

I know this next year, but Goonies comes with Sloth. But, you know, everyone's going to want to play as Data or Mouth or Andy, you know. Um, so yeah, where we can, we're doing it. Um, lots of little hidden things as well. So, ah, you're going back there. I'm coming over. I want to see what's happening. Okay, I guess we're over here. Okay, I'm here.

Don't worry about it. So many people try to do it right away. The rule breaker, as they call you. You don't want to do that. You want to wait, right?

They wanted, they wanted to be able to collect Minifigures, uh, uh, that they couldn't get anywhere else. You know, 'cause obviously the the LEGO ranges every year, they they just get better and better and and they nail the things that they're doing.

It's like, you know, if I go out and and pay, you know, $5 whatever it is for for my pack, yeah, I'm getting something unique and original and cool.

I liked how it was 14 seconds of button presses to say you could shook your head no on that one. I would have been, I would have been fine with that. But yeah, yeah, that was one of the big takeaways. Uh, and the one of the other takeaways that that we got was people wanted, um, unique digital offerings. Um, and so this year you'll notice in even the Fun Packs, every single pack has something unique. So if I was to to go out and buy the the The Adventure Time Fun Pack, I get access to the Adventure World, which you would if you bought the Level Pack, but you get",

So we we've tried to make sure that the value offering in each pack is is bigger, um, hence why adding more characters and and and extra digital content.

And we've seen that game after game after game. And that's where the sort of the idea of the Battle Arenas kind of came from was like, well, people really enjoyed just smashing each other up, so let's make a game mode out of it. And then it became four-player. And, you know, it's you can play v 3v1. The AI will obviously fill in the gaps. And then there's four different modes. You know, there's there's Capture the Flag, there's Objective Mode, there's Base Bash.",

You can 10 different Arenas and you can spend like all day just, uh, arena-ing each other. Um, but I'll say it like that, that's a weird thing that sounded weird. The the cool, the coolest thing is that it's it's again any of your toys. So it's not just like, oh, only these new gold tag toys. It's any of the the the toys from Year One and Year Two. You can put in the Arenas, um, which is the coolest thing.

You do the the competitive stuff with them. I guess that's a bad way to say actually, 'cause everybody has a Hub World no matter what. But these are the ones that have competitive worlds. Yeah, the Arenas. Yeah, so that's and and as well it kind of signifies in your collection when, yeah, you see some of the pictures people send in and how they've displayed them. Sure. Uh, this the coolest. I saw one that was on this like rotor stack system which must be used for displaying like cakes or something. Um, and it was huge, this huge, huge thing.

I, I take photos of them all the time. People show and ask where I got them. I got these big stainless steel tool kits, right? I saw it. This the yellow one was, yeah, exactly, exactly. And then I got, I had to get another one. So I have everything in these two tool kits. And I think one of the most decisive moments of like what is the difference between me and my father is when I was in his garage and he had the same tool kits filled with tools and screws and nails and stuff.

So now when you guys started LEGO Dimensions Year One, were Story Packs on the drawing board forever? 'Cause for me, like it was so clear last year that there were the Fun Packs right here, some figures, Team Packs, two characters, Level Pack, a meatier level, a new set of trophies.
