It's good to be here with you today. It's good to be here with you today, Colin. A big day. PlayStation VR is in Kinda Funny Studios. Of course, we're on the set here of Colin and Greg Live. Um, we have the VR unit, we have a boatload of games, codes to redeem. It's a big weekend for us now. And then we got this uh charging station and display station. But I want to start with the big one. I want to get inside this box. First off, a sleek box. I always like, I always like PlayStation hardware when it's simple. We got it here. Kevin, give me SkyCam. You got it here. PlayStation VR. You up there. Simple. You're going to see this on yourself. You're Target. You're going to be unable to resist. You're going to be like, \"I want to be that guy, that gentleman.\" Parents are going to walk by Target and be like, \"That guy is looking right at Batman. My kid loves looking\"",

I'm going to buy this unit.\" What? There's two PlayStations. Which one should I buy? And then, then it'll be a giant discussion. Yeah, you go all the contents, all the stuff you'd expect. Kevin's not even in the overhead, so we're going to get into it now. Now, I don't have my equipment here. I don't want to tear apart this box. Now, you know, in the old days, I, I had a reputation for getting crazy when I would tear up unboxings, right? Not this time. This time I don't want to do it because this one's going to have to carry all this stuff back to the house. You know what I mean? Well, I'm already here. Okay, chief man, tough guy. Hey, chief man. Hey, chief man. Don't come over here, push your wares and knives on me. Are you excited for PlayStation VR, Colin? I mean, I've been excited about it for what, years now, so yeah.",

And I just, 'cause I got one shipped to me as well, which I thought was very kind. Uh, and so I've given my pre-order to Kevin. Isn't that nice? And you're not going to charge him for it, right? Uh, no, I'm going to charge him three or four times what it's worth. Oh, wow. Okay. Kevin, your VR unit will be $1,500. I'm good then. Now, Kevin, you live in a shoebox, like we all live in small San Francisco apartments. Yep. You live in a very small apartment. That's not true at all. What's Paula going to think when she comes home to find you in the lawn water? I like, you need that much space. You can just sit on your couch.

You could have probably been $50 cheaper without all this packaging. Wow. I got my quick start guide here. This is pretty cool. This is pretty cool. Yeah, so far, so good. Go in here. You see the systems. You got the HDMIs. You're plugging everything in. All right. All right. There's way too many things to plug in. I'm un-excited now. This is cables. This is, oh God, look at it.

I don't know if you guys can see a PlayStation branded microfiber. Thought you know how I feel about my microfiber. Everyone knows you love a good microfiber cloth. You also loved microfiche. Actually did like microfiche. Who didn't like microfiche? You always wanted it to be cooler than it was. Like, like I'm unwrapping something from The Butcher Shop, a nice pork loin here. Got to have the sticker over the Sony. You don't want that. Yeah, yeah. You don't want any dust collecting in there on any of that thing. You laserra.

You get anything you want at FlamingToast.com. They don't give us any money. Well, they did once, but then we stopped doing, you know, Nick never renewed that contract. I was like, we got to renew that contract. 'Cause Mick's busy in Morocco. Also true. Just in general. Get that thing on your big **** giant head. It's happened for the first time. I'm in VR, everybody. I can see everything. Nothing. It fit nicely. Yeah, I mean, that's always the thing I talk about and like what I, you know, I've been so impressed with with PlayStation VR is the fact that fits right over the glasses, super snug, super easy.

The first time they ever handed it to us. Yeah, it was, it's all so I don't even know. Yeah, I don't know how to, how to do it actually. These guys right there, you push those and then you can move that with your hand. You move that sliders back and forth wherever you want. I broke it. Well, then that becomes yours and I take the other one. My head's too big. No, it's not, Colin. You say your head's, wait, what is that little nose slot? I've never really had a chance to actually like, I know, right? We're always in a, we're always getting rushed in, getting in there to do something.

But Triangle, Circle, X, Square. Okay, this is a screw. That's a screw. Very important. Very important part of it. All right, so show me how to do, how to make it bigger again. You just push back. Yeah, no, these two buttons here, right? Yeah. Oh, wait, I screwed it up. Now I'm talking to you all wrong. I'm upside down too. That's not helpful. I'm like, wait, where is it? Yeah, wait a second. I just did. No, you have no idea what you're talking. Wait, no, I just, I just did it. They were just there. Does it have something to do with the button?

Exactly. I see they must have, the first time I ever do that, they must have hit the button for me and then slid it over.

I meant to clean the room today. Did my time wrong, Kevin. I spent my time all wrong. Now I'm going to, it's going to be a busy weekend. Get that all screwed up. And now, not awkwardly at all, we're going to connect everything and show how that works. Maybe we did this unboxing live. People were like, \"You didn't unbox the processing. You didn't.\" We're like, \"Who?\" I, my argument would, \"I don't need it. I was going to throw it away. What is it? It's all, it's all in the headset, right?

Nothing. I was saying going in front. I'm going to get there. Calm down. What's this problem, man? You know what I mean? He didn't even catch me any the other stuff. I'm in frame. Look at this auto. All right, so we got the power. We got your power adapter here. Then here's, here's the processing box. The little PS4. Correct. Look how little they made the PS4 Slim. More sacred symbols, which I enjoy. Why does it do that? I know. Read the instructions. I don't know how to read. Go through the, it's in French. J pill we we PlayStation a Vu kotra system.

Look, it says it's like the Xbox One HDMI, PS4 HDMI, TV HDMI, PS4 HDMI, TV. This is a fan. All right. You know what? Like for real, did we need the plastic covering around the fan? Okay, the dust is going to get where the dust gets. Whoa, Kev's using that digital zoom. What I like about when he uses the digital zoom is it's a lot like in a Jason Bourne movie when they're like, \"Enhance!\" It's much slower and more inaccurate, but it's like, \"Wow, that's an amazingly accurate picture you took from a mile away.\" Um, all right, so yeah, you unplug the HDMI cable from your PS4 system and then plug it into the processor unit where it says PS.

Okay, no one does. Oh, connect your PlayStation Camera to your PS4 system. Hint: If you already connected your camera, you can skip this step. Nice. See your camera's instruction manual for setup information. Now, look at this. All right, so I'm jumping ahead obviously, 'cause you're doing this. Kevin, can you give me the overhead shot? Right. So we got it plugged in there, right? Then you go **** like that. It's still in. It's hidden. And that's when you plug in the headset unit itself. 'Cause it's got these dongs here.

Now, as if the colors black and white weren't enough color to make you understand where what goes where, I want you to know they've matched the sacred symbols here as well. That's cool. Oh, that's Triangle, Circle on the white. And then there, Triangle, Circle on your thing here. They're getting a little out of control. X, Square on this one, or Cross, Square, I should say honestly. And then look at this. You ready, Kevin? Uh-huh. Everything's hidden. Well, not everything. Most of it. I mean, I can still see the box and nothing's hidden.

Regina, if you're watching this on YouTube, because that's the only place you can watch it, go find that video. Everybody put it in the comments. The Regina music video from Regina, France.
