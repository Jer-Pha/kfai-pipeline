And if you see there's a there's a clear line. That's a What the **** That's pretty ridiculous. Yeah. So Geoff. Yes sir. Today our question comes from 19-year-old Carlos. Carlos says \"How do I last longer during sex? This seems to keep being an issue.\" I mean I think practice makes perfect. You get used to each other and you get used to uh what that person likes what you like. You know kind of the mechanics of how the body is going to work together and you kind of know how to back it off a little bit. Um but also I find that paying more attention to her helps me last a little bit longer too. Like when I always make it about her when I make it about what's going on with her body is she enjoying this? What position are we in that's best suited for her? Then I'm thinking about her and not so much about",

Then I'm thinking about her and not so much about myself and I'm getting out of my own head. See I have a really easy answer. It's purple dinosaurs and triangles. I always just think about that and it always helps every single time. You think that get old but I don't know why. I don't know why the triangles but think of the triangle and it will help. Mine's similar to yours. And I'm I'm I'm a little I'm a tad older. Uh I I can tell you years of alcohol abuse help too. Okay. Yeah. But uh what I what worked for me when I was younger and I don't know if you guys are familiar with these people. Do y'all ever watch wrestling? Yeah. Oh yeah. You know who King Kong Bundy was? Of course. You picture King Kong Bundy while you're having sex you will last a year. Does it overdo it though? Like where it's just like now it's you can't even No. I'm",

Like where it's just like now it's you can't even No. I'm just enough attracted to Bam Bam Bigelow and King Kong Bundy. Keeps me in the game but it slows things down. Okay that's good. We say this all the time but communication is key on this. Let her know that this is a problem for you. let her know that there's an issue and help her get her to help you work through this right? Like when you're going and you realize that you're about getting close stop do some other stuff for a little bit and go back to it. And you can actually train your brain to not freak out and climax so quickly. Oh yeah condoms. I mean condoms are great for a myriad of reasons. They really are. Least of which not tying you to that person for the rest of your life. That is true. But uh but yeah like if you want to put like three condoms on that's not You know",
