Not $60 games are extremely cheap compared to the games we grew up with like extremely cheap the cheapest that they've been ever in fact that I did a piece on IGN along time ago called the real cost of gaming people can go check that out where I did all the math on how much games actually cost and that games today are actually cheaper than they've ever been but I feel like games could get even cheaper and I think games can get even more expensive but I think the thing that you it's the",

No, graphics are definitely the most important our gameplay very important but I think that goes to the stickiness mm-hmm hours played and replayability show that's important I think that goes to the resonance you know so I think it's these more intangible terms that you have to use and I think it's going to change because if you say well the 100-hour prep, the 100-hour point of this game is a reason why this is worth $60 and then I can just push you another game that I'm like well this game's 100 hours why does it matter here you have to use more vague language I guess is what I'm saying in terms of like what what strikes you then these these kind of like PR ish you know bullet points of like you know",

You can actually charge $500 for a game specifically no no I'm just using an example that the price is the $60 price was arbitrary it's a lot as games become more and more in the games industry becomes more and more like the movie industry it's interesting to see the pricing of movies and how it hasn't changed much like yeah movies the pricing goes up but it's all still standardized like it doesn't matter if it's a one-hour movie or a three hour movie if it's Rated R, Rated PG the content of it how long it took to make none of that matters it is still gonna cost you $17 you know there's not cheaper movies I",
