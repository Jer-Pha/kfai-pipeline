It's just and I'm not in school now, so I don't really know what they're they're teaching the kids. But for me, it was Maya Angelou and Shakespeare and all this stuff. But I'm sure that there is a lot of people that look at like Tupac for example and like things that he said. I guarantee there's classes dissecting the lyrics of those songs and stuff like that. And I think that you know, what is the difference there? I think it's all very contextual of what they're talking about applies to the experiences that they had. But it's the ones that stand above that you can kind of take something from and apply it to others. And that's why Shakespeare I think is so you know, you look at The Lion King, it's just Hamlet but with a different coat of paint. But that's what why it's so important is that I didn't know that either is that those things who is Timon?",

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern probably. Yeah, okay. That's genius. I did not even put that together till right now. Yeah, I mean, **** Disney ripping **** off. **** have an original idea, you pieces of ****. But I think that that's the thing is like though it's those core ideas that are why what we're talking about is that right? Is that thing that you can take and apply whether it's 2016 or 1600s, it's still there's something there. But to that point too, there could there could be no Shakespeare today. You know, like Shakespeare was a product a highly illiterate **** society at that time that saw these plays in word of mouth like went through and like no one even there were people that aren't contemporary to Shakespeare never heard of them that eventually",

Like, you know, people had went to plays and they were like, you know, and it was just slow burn kind of like VR is going to be, I think. Ah, but there could be no Shakespeare today because he would be like, you know, think about like the great plays today or the last 100 years. Like The Producers is a great example. Like everyone loves everyone loves Mel Brooks, right? Like Mel Brooks is **** awesome. He's he's the man. But even The Producers dominance and it's one of the most dominant plays in Broadway history.

I'm telling you right now, no one's going to talk about Hamilton two years. You know, but if Hamilton if something like H and Hamilton's awesome by the way. Like I know it is. I know people love it. I'm not trying to talk **** about. I listen to a few of the songs and it's great. The point is that there is too much competition because Shakespeare was all that those people had. Like what else were they going to like what else was were they going to do? You know, like I don't know.

So you even have to pass through that granular kind of sieve of history to like and there's only a few left. You know, and I don't think we're going to have much of those from today. But I think now it's like you look at movies and stuff like that. I think movies are the thing that are finally kind of getting to that point where it's like you say there can't be a Shakespeare. It's like, all right, well, there can be a James Cameron or there can be a George Lucas. You know, and all that stuff where it's like talking about quotes, you know, 'Do or do not. There is no try.'

Uh, so I was thinking about um uh like kind of conventional advice that your parents gave you or things that they said to you when you were a kid and you rolled your eyes or just kind of went it one year out the other and then you kind of think about about it today and you're like, oh, they were right. And there's a and there's a lot of things that my parents told me that were they were absolutely right about. Oh, no, I I had I had to sit down with my mom one time.

I don't know if I've ever did on this show about how my dad uh when I moved here a couple years after I moved here. So like maybe in 2008, 2009, went out to dinner with him or whatever and he apologized to me because he's like, I really when I was 12 and 13 through until I was in college, I was really obsessed with internet culture and like gaming culture and I was writing facts on GameFAQs and like writing for small websites and like just spending all my money on games and all immersing immersing my stuff and that kind of stuff.

I just thought like, why aren't you writing things that matter? Like you you take your time to read all this great stuff, but you don't but then you're writing about video games and you're doing all this stuff. And he's like, I was just totally wrong about you about like what you were doing and stuff. And and you often brought up like uh I would be on computer so my computer in my room so much at my old Sony Vaio that my keyboard had no letters on it. Like it was totally blank because I had like worn him away. And um he often brings it up. He's like, it's just an amazing thing that you had like these eroded keys on this thing.

You were writing these things that ultimately ended up really mattering to people and got you this job in this career. But I didn't believe in you. And so I'm sorry. You know, but then I also turn into a conversation about the things he was right about. And when I talk when I my my mom was much my mom was full of much more like practical like heartfelt advice about love for instance. About like, remember when I uh had a really heart my like a heartbreaking experience in college, like really devastating experience. And I remember her telling me she came to my dorm room and uh I was like in devast I was like totally in terrible shape. And she's like, I promise you like it will get better. Like it will it will get better. And that's why I tell people that too. Like when they write an us, I'm like, dude, I know like I know I remember it was **** there was like",

And so she was more into like these little anecdotes and little like, it's just trust me, it's going to be fine. We'll get through this together. But my dad was much more a big picture like uh and I think shaped who I was. And when I think about the things that he told me that he was right, my dad used to always say two words to me all the time when we would listen to the news or like watch news. And he always he would just say, pay attention. That's like all he would say is like, pay attention. Um and he was right. It's important to pay attention. And you would often talk rail about taxes and and onerous government which we still deal with today and all these kinds of things. And that's very much for my dad. And he was right about",

Uh um you know, he's trying to build a house out east in Long Island and he's had that land for 18 months. But he's dealing with a bureaucratic nightmare that like will not let him build the house that he wants to build there or whatever. And like all these things kind of come to fruition and you realize, wow, this man really knows what he's talking about. Like it sounds like it sounds like kind of, you know, my dad just being my dad.

So I want to thank him for that. But that's one of the things that I I I think about when when I think about the things my parents told me that I kind of rolled my eyes out of the time. What did I care about taxes when I was 18? You know, like yeah, I I didn't believe in taxes when I was 18 because I thought that that's what I was supposed to be as a young conservative or whatever learning for my dad.

Timmy, I'm I'm struggling hard to find like an actual concrete thing as an example of this. I mean, I think kind of in line with it. I I feel like I was lucky enough that like I trusted my mom like from the beginning. Like she she's been wrong about a whole bunch for sure.
