            "text": "Colin, topic three of the day is something that you brought up to me yesterday, the PSN and the quality of games on it. What do you have to say about that? I'm wondering if we're like crossing a, we're having a shift on PlayStation Network specifically. I can't speak to Xbox Live authoritatively enough to know if it's happening there too. My suspicion is that it is, um, where I'm, I'm, I'm feeling like there's no quality control of any like objective measure on these consoles. This came up to me because I can't remember the name of the game. I wish I did because it's important, I guess it's somewhat important to the argument, but a few weeks ago a game was released on PSN that was like totally ****, like full of stolen assets and art and music apparently. And like it was like everyone was like, how the **** did this happen? Like we expect to see this, this happens every day on iOS and Android. There are like totally unmitigated free market markets where they'll eventually get taken down, but",

There are like totally unmitigated free market markets where they'll eventually get taken down, but like there's no process. Same thing with Steam. And when I saw this, I was like, and a lot of people were like, how did this happen on PlayStation Network? How like where, where is the quality control? Did no one like look at this? Does no one, does no one like try to figure out like, yeah, this game might not be for me, but we can understand how this might be for someone. There's some sort of objective quality, uh, level of quality to this particular game that like, that under no circumstances will, uh, a vast majority of the audience just hate. And it seems to me that like they're flooding the market in a very Steam's or iOS way lately in the last couple years since PS4 really launched where I'm like, this is in the wrong direction.

This is going to start disc, we were talking about the Vita thing, the Vita argument of like, of discovery and of like having a place where you can make some money. Like they're actually injuring themselves. And I'm curious if you guys have noticed this on the platforms that you play and if, and if you think it's problematic too, because I find it to be extremely troubling. Um, that on PSN yesterday for instance, or today, but on PS I Love You when we, when we recorded it, um, that or two days ago when we recorded it, that we read something like 14 new games or something. I thought it was more than that. I was like, I'm like, how is that possible? There should maybe be this many games a month, maybe on your platform. I mean, for, I don't, I, I understand consumer choice and all that kind of stuff, but I'm like, you're like, what are some of these games? Like I can't imagine some of these",

Like I can't imagine some of these games on a platform with 45 million users. I bet you some these games sell literally 5,000 copies. Sure. It's like, what is the point of even releasing a game that no one cares about that you don't promote? There's no PlayStation Blog post. You stealth release it and you bury ****. I think you give too much credit and I think you've done it for a long time to what goes on over there behind closed doors about a game getting on the PSN. I don't think there's like a quality control board sitting there playing it. I'm sure it gets rated by the ESRB or whatever. It gets cert certified or whatever that it runs and they just don't care. They put it up. And this is I think key to the argument you have had with Andrea and not like an argument, you know, the argument Andrea and you are making on separate sides.",

And the fact that I think Andrea was arguing right that the things you were talking about with all these mobile developers falling and failing and all these **** games happening, she was arguing that happens already. And I think it's just a per capita thing, you know what I mean? Where I think honestly there's so many more, it's so easy to make an iOS or a mobile game. $99 gets you the, the, the program you need to make a game and put it out. An example of this is that, you know, I was like, did Guacamelee come to iOS? Put Guacamelee in and it autofilled. I'm like, oh, it did. And then there was like three apps there that were not Guacamelee but are using that name and like talking about Guac. And I'm like, what are these ****",

But it's because there is that barrier entry of getting a dev kit and getting going and getting working on PlayStation. But if you were to somehow try to get the numbers, do a bunch of division, I'd feel it's closer in terms of per capita basis of like, there's a lot of **** put out. And is, and I, I don't know if you should stop it or how you stop it. The, the, I think the, if anything, the onus on celebrating Champion games falls to the PlayStation Blog or sites or us or personalities that are going to be like the Vita Lounge, the, the guys who make the, you know, the actual Vita magazine, right? The fact that they're going to sit there and celebrate and champion and talk to developers who are making quality products and do it. And so if you're a Vita fan, you're",

And that might be vice versa. But it's one of those things where you can't physically find things as a person like typing in, knowing exactly what you're looking for. You can't always find the game you want. And that is the fact that it's in the data. There's so much **** coming out and it is one giant bucket of DLC add-on game this thing.

And the fact that the crap content is with all of the, are you about to insult the dynamic theme of corn, the corn of the, the corn on the cob rotating? But that's the problem is it's just like every single time I've ever been on PSN, whether it's PS3, PS4, Vita, whatever, it's finding stuff has always been an issue because even if I'm looking exactly search term Final Fantasy X, like why am I getting so many dynamic themes and and like DLC packs and stuff and like things that are just like kind of relevant?

Like finding the, the, the themes and packs, you, you should struggle to find those. You figure, I mean, like the, the, the best worst example of this is like, oh man, it's the first of the month. There's new PlayStation Plus games. And you would go into the store, go to PlayStation Plus, click PlayStation Plus. It's like, do you want to buy one month, six months? I'm like, I want the **** games. Where do I go to find these **** things on the store? And that's the thing is I think that the, the PSN does a good job to an extent of telling you what they want to tell you.

Then you click into it and it's just like every single time I'm trying to get a PlayStation Plus game, it never makes sense to me. And I'm like, and then it turns into me searching for exactly what I want. For it's F and then you got to go Y A and you got to go, all right, time to N. And then you got, there's so many options there. And it's that's where I think the, the, the crap argument really gets in the way. Yeah, there's clutter. I think it's better on PS.

Like they definitely didn't download all hundred of these in one day. Um, yeah, like I don't, I don't know what they're thinking with a lot of that kind of stuff. But my, I feel like there's a solution to this particular problem that at least I'm raising in amongst these litany of other legitimate issues, which is, um, I really do feel like these companies need to hire a board of people that literally play these games and and they're submitted for certification. And it certification shouldn't stop, begin and start as does the game work and is the trademark logo proper and did you, you know, um, replace the A button with the X button and or whatever, you know, whatever.",

Although that didn't happen in Tland, which is **** hilarious. Um, and rather like, and my, my mind is like, have 12 people with very like, that you hire, you have to like really go out and find these people. This is, this is my like kind of harebrained solution. But this is Nintendo Seal of Quality. Exactly. Go and F, not that that really meant everything in the world 'cause it didn't. But, but idea. But to that point, in the NES era, as a lot of people know, you can only publish five games a year on Nintendo. You had to pick and choose the games. Like, and this was a thing that, um, I think guys like, um, Frank Cifaldi, I think some other guys talk about that like the NES has games that are done that are translated that are finished. And because the publishers and there's actually a lot of them and because the",

And because the publishers and there's actually a lot of them and because the publishers could not publish more than uh, five games a year and some of them didn't have like shell companies like Konami did with Ultra Games where they could get with 10 games. Um, they just sat on a shell. Final Fantasy for instance, the real Final Fantasy on the NES is done, translated, finished. It was even at CES and they never released it. You know, like they just never **** released the game there. You find these things over and over again. Um, for all these reasons that Nintendo was looking at what the, the Atari experience from '81, '82, '83 where they're like, this fell apart because there was no control of, there was no quality control. No one gave a ****. People were just **** in. Quick Oats was making games. Like, like everyone was making games. And that's like, we're kind of seeing a similar",

And that's like, we're kind of seeing a similar thing now where like that's not good for the market because people then don't trust quality. And what I've noticed is the segue of, you know, with the fall of THQ and all these kinds of things where we had kind of like a games, I think you still have your a publisher and something like Deep Silver. But if you really think about it, there's not that many retail games that are like just bad. Oh, no, you know, anymore. There used to be like bad retail games that were coming out. Now the Explorer goes to Mars. Now there's like, you really like really have to think about it to even think about something that's like lower than, you know, a Metacritic of five or six that comes out of retail at $60 because there seems to be some thought going in there because everyone's now going and being like, well, we don't have",

So we can go to PSN and release games at a cheaper price point that are shittier. And I, so my, my solution is to say like, hire 12 people, like literally a dozen that know games, that have varied expertise in games. And during the certification process of the technical, at the technical level, have these people just sit down and watch or sit down and look at at the game and exchange notes on these games. They don't even have to play them for that long. But the, the question shouldn't be like, do you like it? 'Cause like if someone was like, do you like this racing game? Be like, no, I don't like this racing. You can recognize exactly. But be like, I'm a gaming expert and yeah, like this, this passes the smell test. Like someone's going to like this. This has",

And then a game goes, you know, and if it, it falls for below that, you **** kick the game back and you're like, this, we, we are experts feel like this game doesn't belong in the PlayStation Network 'cause it diminishes the quality that we are striving for and and buries games. Listen, if people are discovering games because their trophies are up on **** PSNProfiles or Exophase and that's the only time you ever hear about the game, probably not worth being on the PSN, you know, probably not.

You have to imagine that if whoever would be, whoever's plate this would fall on at Sony, right? I would imagine the counterargument to this is the fact that, well, we don't care because we're still making games or money off the good games that are coming out. We don't care because the shitty games are still paying licensing fees to get on to PlayStation 4. And the board that is telling you if a game's good or bad falls on the shoulders of an IGN, a GameSpot, a Vita Lounge, if you want to get granular with it, right?

No, I, in terms of the, the different markets and stuff, I think music is a good way to look at it, right? iTunes comes out and it's, it is that, it is a, a, it's just a storefront that has, it started a bit more boutique, then got just, it has everything good, bad, it doesn't matter. But in order to get there, you had to back in the day be on a real label or whatever. As things progress, we literally have a song on iTunes. That's how easy it is, you know? And uh, that's where a lot of the things come into play of just like the stolen assets and this and that. There's, I mean, there is a quality control thing you got to go through that's saying like, do you",
