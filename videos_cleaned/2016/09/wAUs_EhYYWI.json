Now again, you want to know how in deep with the Kinda Funny community, how much of a fan the guy who makes Bears Can't Drift is? Oh, he sent us codes, set all this, and they said, \"Here's a bunch of giveaway codes.\" And then he had one code, he said, \"Make sure you give this to Steven Insler, if he's still alive,\" because the joke is, \"dealer died.\" And it's so much Bears Can't Drift. Sure, if we had a lot of fun in that, I'm looking forward to playing that when we get back. Yeah, it's it's fun game. All right, Somber Owl says, \"Hey guys, when do you think?\" Can I get a minority report on that name, Kevin? Yeah, goddamn racist Kevin. If I put the hat down, you know it's okay. If I put the ceramic top in the middle, you know what I do. All right, you guys are definitely gonna make fun of me. His name absolutely not Somber Owl. His name is Somber Owl.

Personally, I'd like to see them go somewhere we haven't seen yet, like a desert location or possibly somewhere in Europe. Seems like it'd be a next year game, right?\" Fallen Extreme. Yeah, maybe E3. Ubisoft, Lisa. Yeah, yeah. Well, we see it. Yeah, I yeah, probably before. I feel I feel like Ubisoft's being a little more deliberate now, so I don't know that they're necessarily even gonna release it next year. Primal did way better than they thought too, so I wonder if they're gonna actually double down on that setting as well. But where do I want to see it?

I'd like to go to the US. Let's do a US city. Come on, let's have some fun. What are you thinking? I'll make it up. It'll be like a Willem at Colorado. I'm sure that would be cool to go to like Yosemite or something like that. But or Yellowstone. But I feel like part of those games' allure is that they are at once a foreign, because people, you know, aren't all American, whatever. But there's something not wet turn about those games. That's why I think it'd be different and shake it up. Let's go somewhere, you know, bring it back home. It's possible. It's the fifth game. Yeah, you want that. You want to go be Troy Baker.

My question relates to the pricing of software and hardware in the US when compared to other territories, and more specifically, the huge markup that seems to occur outside of the US. This can be seen on almost any random title you care to think of, but for the sake of brevity, I'll give the example: The Last of Us Remastered Digital on the US PlayStation Store. The game's priced at $19.99, yet in the UK PlayStation Store, the price sits at $39.99 pounds, which at the time of writing works out at around $5. As mentioned previously, this huge discrepancy in pricing can be seen on many titles, and it's the same story when comparing USD to other currencies such as Australian dollars. I realized that the various factors can affect game pricing across differing",

I realized that the various factors can affect game pricing across differing regions, such as regional sales, etc. But to see such an astronomical difference on a consistent basis, over 100% the case of The Last of Us, seems inexcusable. Do you guys have any insider knowledge as to why these price discrepancies occur? Oh, Deus only, or do Sony simply hate us? My love, Niko, we have freedom, and so our freedom all it allows is to use a solid point. Next question: Do you have any real answers? No. So there there are answers for why games are cheaper in some places, or it's more expensive, I should say, in some places. In Brazil, for instance, games are **** way marked up. Hardware hardware is like outrageously expensive there because of significant taxes on imports there. So like there's there's things like that that happened. I think they were saying, wasn't remember what wasn't the PS World",

I think they were saying, wasn't remember what wasn't the PS World literally like $1,000 or something like that? Fake name, erm, like psych ward. So like it's something to do with like over there, and I could be wrong. I'm sure we have Brazilians that could correct me. I don't completely that's something like they have an import tax and electronic like these electronic store tax in a certain way, and it just marks the price up. So I know that like in that specific market, that's the reason or that's one of the reasons. And also in Australia and in places like the UK and stuff, my theory on this, and this is a long this is my my long-held theory, whether sure or not, is that the United States is a huge market, so volume makes you more money on the back end. And when you're in Australia, where you have a fraction of the people playing games, that you have to sell them for more.",

And when you're in Australia, where you have a fraction of the people playing games, that you have to sell them for more. Like III really do think that that it might be as simple as that. In some places, there could be some taxation issues, that could be some funding of different boards that rate the games that you have to pay, and all those kinds of things. But I bet you that and a lot of these smaller countries, and I said UK is not really a small country, but Australia, for instance, it doesn't have a huge population. I bet you something has to do with the fact that in the United States, it's like why they released the PS4 here first. They sold a million units in 24 hours. That wouldn't happen anywhere else. Yeah, so when you're selling at volume, you can afford to sell the game for $60 USD that might cost $80 USD somewhere else because the money needs to be recouped somehow. And if you don't have a volume of gamers",

But I think that there are a lot of Byzantine kind of taxation issues and importation issues in a lot of these countries as well. So Jan Hellyeah says, \"Hey Colin, Greg, and Tim. Congrats on the studio and all the success. I want to know if any of you have an idea about your total kill count in all the video games you've ever played? Jesus, count this. This includes players, AI, neutral, and impulsed robots. Basically everything you can kill in a video game.\" No, that's a millions, millions for sure. We've played games our entire life.

No, I remember when I was playing Doom on the computer. You remember there's rabbits in Doom? This is like one of those things the guy like, \"We're like rabbits or some ****.\" I forget what that was. But I remember we were outside and I had been playing it all weekend or something, and we were gardening or some **** like that. I don't remember. And I made some comment about like cutting a tree in half in our yard to see the rings or whatever. And you my mom flipped out and was like, \"Next we want to cut the heads off those rabbits and see the rings.\" They're like, \"What are you talking about?

What what you got for me? What do you got, big Kev dog? First of all, I was really scared that you were gonna end up kill. No, no. And second of all, they teach you how to cut trees down in school? No, but you know how that was. You going at you like you're on I don't know, we're on a field trip or outdoor ed or some **** or just in class. You're talking about like you used to find a stump and you see the rings and that's how all that damn dumb tree is. But I love that you looked at that tree.

And I'm learning that, you know, with different people in my life as I've gone on. And I think also about dead or dormant kind of things that we don't say anymore. We don't use the term BOARD anymore. B. O. A. R. D. Which was a term that was used constantly in the NES and SNES era. The first board, the second board is then this this goes back to the way people thought about games and and tabletop games in the way they segwayed into.

Yeah, yeah, a leveling. Yeah, like so it's I love that generally. I'm thinking about the way we talk about things, dying and killing and all that kind of stuff. Like they are thrown around in a way that you wouldn't throw them around in the real world. But you know, the newsflash appeal is that it's not the **** real world. So so I think that our world.

Lelouch Lamperouge, shout out sound. It's a Code Geass. They're considering Colin's admiration of Inafune and love of the Mega Man series. What is his opinion of the Battle Network series, which was my favorite? And what does he see as the future of the Mega Man legacy after Mighty No. 9's flop?

Battle Network was very much a product of the time during the late 90s and early 2000s rise on yeah, Pok\u00e9mon and card battling and collecting. I really like Battle Network and Power Network 2. They were really great games. It's just that they and actually really all of them are fine. It's just that like they came out too quickly. And then Star Force did the same thing. And it's like these aren't really Mega Man games. And that's always why I've always questioned the admiration of Legends as well because like what is it what is it about this game that people really love that makes it Mega Man?

I'm like, is that it? Wily Castle. Um, so uh, I feel like the future of Mega Man is uncertain. So so first of all, Mighty No. 9. No one likes Mighty No. 9. It came sucks. And it's a it's a disaster. I think Inafune's legacy is definitely injured over it. And depending on how ReCore goes, and I saw ReCore behind closed doors at E3, and I think it looks just very generic.

And I still really do believe that they're gonna do a big triple A Mega Man game. And and I think that that would be cool. But I also want Mega Man 11. I also want Mega Man X9. It's a similar argument I'm making about Tactics or these other games or the Castlevania Metroidvania style games where I'm like, why don't you just release these a lot and then stop when when it feels like it's time and then bring them back as opposed to like Battle Network.

I they're not Capcom, unlike some other companies we make fun of, are they're not really stupid. Like they just they make weird decisions and they seem to correct themselves often.
