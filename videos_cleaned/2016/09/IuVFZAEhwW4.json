Okay, they came up with a technology in the 80s that made laces completely obsolete, the Velcro, the Velcro. And for some **** dumb reason, we decided to just totally throw that out the window. Not just as an aside, I remember how much of a revelation it was when I learned how to tie my shoes. I remember just being so daunted and like, \"I'm never going to be able to learn how to do this.\" If I sat there and thought about how I tie a shoe, I wouldn't be able to do it. Oh no, like I just have to not think about it and just tie, clear it, clear the mechanism. Yeah, it was hard for me. I was one of them dumb kids, real dumb kids.

Then people start to notice how long it's taking to tie a shoe. \"Why is it taking him so long to tie his shoes, kid?\" So many voices. One of them dumb kids. People start doubting themselves like, \"Maybe I can help. Wait, wait, do I know how to tie sh ****?\"",
