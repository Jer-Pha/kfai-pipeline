He's saying that it can't have multiplayer. I think it's he said multiplayer focused, so that's that's where it gets complicated because obviously Call of Duty is multiplayer focused. But I guess what he's asking is what's the last great Call of Duty like that is known for its campaign? You know, because those games, what's a so what's a great game single player? Ratchet & Clank? Yeah, that's like, yeah, well, even that's kind of open, right? Because you can go to whatever planet you want at one at some point. So we talk about a linear, yeah, experience. Until Dawn.

I think that like, I think what he's saying are qualifies, just making sure. I'm just trying to be clear and put holes in this. I'm Witcher 3 is open world, obvious, right? That's a single player campaign. But yes, exactly. Yeah, Doom, I would definitely put on that list. Um, Doom's a good example of it. Wolfenstein: The Old Blood. Um, God, I do play a lot of open world games. Evil Within. Evil Within could be, but I didn't play enough of it to have an opinion on it. Man, I do play a lot of open world games. Stop texting me.

Chuck, hey, Kinda Funny, recently Xbox has been releasing full game trials for weekends where the entire game is free and then afterwards it's on sale. They recently released WWE 2K16 for a free weekend and I played it and enjoyed it. I hadn't played a wrestling game in years and when the game went on sale, I bought it for $30.

Yeah, I mean, um, I I can understand you're being upset about it, but I also think this is in correct me if I'm wrong, Colin, because I we I guess we don't know, but I it would not surprise me if the two hands there in motion didn't know what the other people were doing.

But that said, like because people often get mad, uh, for instance, on PS Plus, one a game's free the next month and they just bought it the week before, whatever. And I'm like, that's kind of the like the roll of dice, unfortunately, you know. Um, so you just have to be a a choosy kind of consumer. You're going to get **** in that way sometimes.

You know, there's certain games you know that like if you hold off just a month, it's going to be cheaper. If you wait six months, it's going to be sure, given away, right? So it's kind of a how much do you really want to play that game? And like it sounds like you played based on a free thing and got it on sale. It still was on sale, you know, so that sucks. Did do the right thing of, you know, supporting them by with by giving them dollars. The rule of thumb though is like games are always going to become cheaper over time.

It's harder on digital ecosystems because some of these games stay full price for a really long time and then some of them um get cut precipitously in some of these flash sales. Like I'm more I'm like, I can't believe this game's like literally $3, you know, or $5 or $10. Um, it's easier to play that game in retail. But uh, some some developers do the right thing too. Like when uh Tom Happ released Axiom Verge, I think they said that the game will never be on sale in the first year, like ever. And I think that that probably that honesty and candor probably helped them because a lot of people weren't going to wait a year. So that could go a long ways too. Yep, definitely.

I don't think, man, they're really doing it right. Like they are kind of the garbage truck on fire in the bad way. We're the endearing garbage truck on fire. They're the one of watching like, what the **** going to happen next? How are you going to handle this? What are you going to do? Will you ever see another IP, new IP out of them in a AAA space?

The the uh the thing that's going to have to happen with them is someone's going to have to he was talking about he was talking about his the very strong history of Konami, which it is. It's a strong, strong company with a story. We used to put them up there with Capcom and with uh Square and everyone. They're nothing like those companies now. But uh someone has to just take reigns of the of, you know, you could do a that company can be hostilely taken over or um they can sell those IPs or people just new people can become in charge that want to pay, you know, credence to that that history, which the the current leadership doesn't.",

Like they make money in pachinko machines and their health clubs and all that kind of stuff and that's great and maybe that's what they want to focus on. But if they're going to stay in the video game space, which I think they're going to, I think you're going to see a different Konami in a few years. Like I I I really do feel like eventually there's going to have to be this sort of um understanding over there that they're going to have to do the kind of Konami uh restructure, the kind of Konami like, let's put go out hat in hands and explain that we understand like that we kind of **** some things up.

I mean, not only with their acquisition at Atlus, but working on Halo Wars, having one of their studios, Creative Assembly, making Halo Wars 2 and all these kinds of things and making a new Sonic, even though, you know, we don't care, we make fun of Sonic, but a lot of people do care and they're trying to in that ship as we were talking about earlier. And I think I I don't think it's all I don't think all hope is lost with Konami. My hope is that if they're going to just strand those IP with them, that they eventually just sell them.

It was that was what was so **** endearing about it to begin with. I was like, this is amazing. Looks like **** Castlevania, you know? So, um, I don't think all hope is lost personally.

Like phones are a place where people play games and there's games made for that specifically and people are buying them for that specifically. I don't think we'll ever like Apple there for years. People thought Apple was going to make a iPlay or something, put the controller this thing. I'm sure they **** around with it. But yeah, they probably just saw that it wasn't worth it.

Um, the delay of the console actually our friend Jeremy Parish just did a video on Super Mario Bros. Um, that was really awesome about how like the delay of the Family Computer to the Disk System really helped them in the West because they wouldn't have launched with these games, uh, like Zelda and stuff like that that were close to launch that Metroid, Kid Icarus. Um, so that was a right place, right time, not a lot of money situation. But with Sony, it was like, uh, right place and money.

Like where companies like with some means got involved. But I think I just think there's it's like we talk about with shooters and free-to-play games and MMOs and stuff. There's only so much room and I think this place is occupied like by three successful uh competitors. GameEx173 has a fairly similar question.

Or all not yes. I'm surprised that they haven't done that. At PAX, there was at PAX, there was a a not Nintendo obviously, but a bunch of an indie studio there that had made an indie game and was selling it on cartridges for the NES. Yeah, yeah, that happens. Like uh Pier Solar for instance, which is an RPG that came to PS4. It's to come to Vita and on PC and stuff. Came to Genesis um in 2010. And I think the Dreamcast a little.

And that like didn't surprise me because I was like so crazy. That would surprised the hell out of me because I I would have been like, this is actually very intuitive. Nostalgia is everything. Why not make an NES again? Like I I like you don't have to make a million of them, you know? Like but like it's a it would be **** awesome. Like I would **** lose my mind if they were like, we're we're publishing 50,000 copies of Super Mario Bros. 3 on NES cartridges. We're going to find the same innards and all that kind of",

Like that would be totally that would be that's that does surprise me that they don't get involved in that. I mean, it's the same. It's like vinyl, right? That you could easily make a market where you are putting out special editions on cartridges. You are, you know, making your classics available and then inviting people who are still making those kind of games to put them there as well. I mean, I feel like the the Indies like Ramo, they do that stuff. And when I buy music and like I buy a modern rap album and I also get a cassette with it. Like that's just the gimmicky fun of, hey, you also get a cassette. I get that. But like for Nintendo to actually do it, I think the NES Mini is the",
