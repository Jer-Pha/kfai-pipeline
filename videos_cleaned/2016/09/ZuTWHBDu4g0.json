The Baker Square that I used to go to somewhere down by San was gone, right? He used to be one in Marina right by Nick's place, but then to be, I'm going to look in to see if there's Baker Square still around. I loved it, especially when I was little, 'cause they it was one of those places that had coloring, not coloring books, but like coloring pages. They get like coloring menus, yeah.

Where the f*** else am I going to eat the pie? They'll only give you a fork if you buy a slice. Tim, that's it's wholesale. They don't charge you taxes for the whole pie. If they sell it as food, they have to charge you taxes. I don't understand why. Who the f*** cares? That the government, the government cares. That's why you're not allowed to eat it there.

You can add that to any other dessert and it just somehow makes it better. Baker Square still popping off in Chicago. The the BBS of Chicago. I got to be honest with you guys, I uh, I disagree with with the with the lemon. Key lime pie is pretty good. Key Lime Pie's good, but pie in general is not my go-to. Uh, much more of a cake guy. Love the red velvet cake. You so you're saying red velvet cake is the best dessert? I would say that is the dessert that I if you're saying Nick, it's it's your birthday, you're going to eat carbs for this one day. You're you're going to go get Taco Bell first, natch, and then afterward you can have whatever you want. I'm going to go with a giant slice of red velvet cake from SusieCakes. That red velvet cake",

You know, this is not a natural reaction your body should be having to a food product and you don't care. You just power through it and you eat the rest of it and then you stay up and then three days later you crash. It is fantastic. Give also shout out to cheesecake as well. Cheesecake good. It's not that's not the conversation for best dessert. Oh, I think it's in the conversation, but it's not it's not going to win it out. My thing and I want to give a shout out to the Krispy Kreme Doughnuts that are just pure sugar.

No, Kevin, don't give me a rack zoom. Just just give him the one shot. Just give him the one. That's what he wants. That's what he wants. It's it's a trick question. There is no good dessert.

We had drinks. We probably had too many drinks. I we we had just a ton of drink. Uh, and they call like, would you like dessert? And I'm like, why would I want dessert? If I want anything, just give me another f***ing cheeseburger, right? Is this is like a trick question? Like, what is it about dessert? It goes well with it. It doesn't make any sense. It just doesn't doesn't make sense. It's a treat. High overrated. Ice cream overrated. All these things are overrated.

The main attraction is still that middle main course, right? But you're ramping up and now you're something and then and then you disappointingly end it. That's kind of the way I look at it. Like you ramp the appetizer starts. You start with the drink, the appetizer. Everything's fine. You go up to the entree like a step. Like picture it as a step and then you take a step back down and go to dessert. Why would you want to keep going up? I think you do keep going or staying at that level. That's where the sweet.

There's so many so many. What's the worst dessert? I think it's a more interesting discussion. Werther's Originals. Love those things. You I can make an argument for Werther's, especially when you it's called pocket dessert. Like you don't think you have a Werther's in there. You put your hand in your pocket.

I just feel like I the thing about it is that since I was very little kid, I've always not been into like mostly into sweet food and with there's exceptions like of course, but I've always felt really left out actually.

I don't automatically go, oh, I can eat anything I want. Like, for instance, I was watching I was I follow Rock on Instagram and he gives himself cheat days. I can only imagine like once every like month or whatever the f*** he has to do.

Well, that's because you're healthy though. Like, you think of it in that way of just like, that is your cheat day. No, 'cause I mean, to me, pizza and cookies are exactly the same.

I like just I feel like it just helps me digest. So I just have a weird rule set. But I remember even like, it's always been this way with Halloween.

Everyone was like, oh, this the woman down the street gives away Nestl\u00e9 Crunch bars. Whatever. Like that's great because I can get like $3 for that.
