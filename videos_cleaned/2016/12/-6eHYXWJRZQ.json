I of course am one of your hosts, Greg Miller, and before we get to the rest, I of course want to thank you all very, very much for coming out here today, but more importantly, not just coming here today, supporting PS I Love You XOXO as you have. One fan, more fans. All right, great. Uh, it's really weird to think about that this is our 64th week being PS I Love You XOXO. Uh, of course, here are some of the episodes you saw last year at PSX. We got to come out and do a panel, and of course, we'd only been a podcast for, I'm bad at math, 11 weeks. It's uh, it wasn't a real thing yet, but the problem was that you guys supported us so much, you made it a real thing, and I want to take a moment to keep thanking you, but at the same time, thank PlayStation. I don't know if you've noticed, we are the only podcast Colin and I that ever gets to come to",

And while many of the haters on the internet will say, of course, that's the case, they're Sony ponies, you know better than anyone that sometimes we're not nice to PlayStation, sometimes we're not nice about consoles and things we don't like. Uh, but it doesn't matter. Uh, PlayStation understands that, they respect that, they respect the relationship. They let us come here and entertain you, and they let us do that because you guys are so good to us. I hope you understand how the relationship works. You support us, they see that, and they understand that they have to speak to this community that is you. So thank you all very much.

I don't know what the rest of the show is going to be now. How are you guys doing? Great. Fantastic. Is this working? M. Colin's mic isn't working. Can we get some bass in his mic or just leave it off the entire time? Want talking to my mic, Colin? A lot of people would like that. You can whisper into Tim's mouth. Yeah, tell. Hello, is your microphone on? Did you slide the button on? It's on. There it is. There's the voice.

I assure you no one came here being like, man, they are going to have some scoops about PlayStation today. Now, I, I have a stick mic because, uh, apparently I can't wear these because of my earrings, and they're like, can you take your earrings out? And I'm like, they haven't come out in 14 years, so no, I can't do that. Uh, but, uh, I've also worn these before, and they haven't had any problems, but I'm going to defer to the experts.

Like, is, is this how I get like the 69th PlayStation card? Like, I just need to hold this out and just like see what happens in the day. Eventually they opened them up, and then I went in, and I was like, how does it smell like this? It just opened it up. How does it look like this is the bigger question.

Uh, saw they were doing direct feed for someone else when I went and saw Michael. Uh, met Eugene Jarvis, which was cool. Also, uh, saw our friend Shawn Norton, uh, who's a good buddy of us.

No, that's the thing. You, you waved at me. Oh, you, you got a Star Wars shirt on. Okay, that makes sense. I was just like, all right, cool, dude. These bean bags are the best things.

I played it on smooth mode. Have you done the demos yet, Colin? No, I don't want to see it.
