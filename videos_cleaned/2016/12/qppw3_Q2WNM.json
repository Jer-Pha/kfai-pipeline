And our car was literally downstairs uh to pick us up and take us to the to take us to the uh show. And I looked at my wife. I was like, \"I don't know if I can go.\" And I got myself in the car. It was about a 30-minute car trip. I was dying the entire time. I sat down in my seat and they were like, \"We need you.\" And they literally brought me backstage. I presented the award and I got out and I left. Um and we had already booked this trip for my 40th birthday. We're going to go to the South of France. Stupid. It was cool.
