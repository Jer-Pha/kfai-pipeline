I'm wearing my Movement Watch there. Okay, that's a good zoom, Cap. Good job. Let me tell you about Movement Watches, ladies and gentlemen. First off, they're great holiday gift. Don't be silly. Movement Watches started just $95. At a department store you're looking at 400 to 500 bucks. Movement figured out that by getting rid of all the middlemen and selling online and getting rid of that retailer markup, they get you the best possible price. They have classic design, quality construction, and stylized minimalism. There's over 500,000 watches sold in more than 160 countries. You can get $15 off today with free shipping and free returns by going to movement watches calm / Greggy. This watch has a really clean design. Honestly, I get talked about all time at the wedding. I think the bride might leave her man and come home with me. I'm just kidding, Jen, that",

I walked into the office now. Yeah, I'm sorry. Let me back go paint me a picture. Hey, will you jump right to the hop? I paint you a little foreplay. Two days ago, for some ungodly reason, the weather decided to go real cool, real fast. I don't like it now. I like it because I like that it's wintry and I like that it's a holiday time, but I don't like it because then I have to be cold like every goddamn night until the sun decides to pop back up.

And I tell you, Greg, we've got a heater in this place and you're like, no, we don't. I did not say no. I think maybe I said I did not know that you were like something to the scent. Well, you're like your **** ass. We absolutely do not have a heat. I didn't ask what he said no. Oh, that's been said. He was like, yeah, it's amazed that I could be agitated here. You're a lying sack of ****. Um, is what he said to me, not what I'm saying him, but I'm kind of referring that what was he saying to you that he said to you?

You come from a place where it snows. Tim, you grew up three hours in place where it snows. I've been to that place few times. Tahoe. Yeah, yeah. Yes, you're right. I mean, there's multiple times that come to mind of those were the coldest type of times I've ever been in my life.
