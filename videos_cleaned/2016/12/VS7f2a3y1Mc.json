I'm one with the force, the force is one with me. Greg, almost sure are you're one with the Heather Grey shirt over here. The pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty, bring back Dengar sooner or later. And over there, wor the pure one, Tim Tim host. I thought was just Tim Gettys for now. Tim Gettys, uh so here's how it works. This is our review or spoilercast for Rogue One. The first part as always spoiler free. We're not going to spoil anything. We're going to talk about what we liked, if we liked it, if you should see it, that kind of thing. That'll be very short of course and then we'll get into full spoilers that hopefully if you watched the movie then you stick around you have some to discuss it with. And if you haven't watched the movie yet you can watch the rest of this video later. So Nick, yes start me off, did you like it? I liked it a lot.",

Um it's not that it's flaws but I think that ultimately in in the in the sort of um you know order of Star Wars movies this one's this one's ranking toward the top for me right now. Very interesting. I liked it. Um it wasn't until maybe halfway through or three quarters of the way where I was like oh **** this is really good. Yeah, this is getting really good. The first I maybe it was I we'll talk about it I'm sure maybe it was that I didn't know the characters and I I didn't have a Anchor Point to it but I was just like watching all right cool this is fun.

Um I think that uh similar in some ways to episode 7 I I think that there's some issues with it and I actually think there's a couple of significant issues with this movie. Um but I still think overall it's a great movie and uh the fact that I like it so much with with uh these issues I think as a testament to it. I think every Star Wars fan obvious to see it and I I um I think it's good for reasons that I think um some people won't well we w'll talk about when we spoil it but I think there's some things about it um specifically with the way they build the Empire um in the movie that I think is actually super important to the rest of the movies um and I think was unintentionally so.

Having said that are you **** kidding me this was great. It was so great and I I was telling Nick this a couple days ago I was like he asked me he was like do you think that we'll ever have something that makes you feel the magic that Force Awakens did and it's like that movie had so much hype going into it and so much just like expectations and we were just like man this is going to be amazing and then it was and it had that payoff of like oh my God these characters and these the sounds and these like things that we we love so much are are",

There's a point in this movie where things all of a sudden start paying off and I'm just like I'm I feel like a **** little kid you know this movie made me feel like a little kid. Do you think it's going back now this way better than Force Awakens? Yes okay Colin um it's different than the Force Awakens sure I I don't know that it's better like the Force Awakens is just a New Hope again um so I would say that Rogue One's probably a better movie but uh probably less resonant at the same time.

I thought Force Awakens was way better. Force Awakens I mean literally I was Greening that entire movie and when it ended like that was so much fun. Now granted Rogue One's not trying to be a fun movie and Rogue One's a great movie don't get me wrong but I like Force Awakens but do you think that's because we already had Forest wakens you know because you've already been exposed to that level of Star Wars in this Modern Age? I I don't know I think honestly it might have something to do with the fact that I I was never so into the original trilogy right so that like it's like okay cool and it's like all right we doing the Death Star this all right I know but then like when we get to like the",
