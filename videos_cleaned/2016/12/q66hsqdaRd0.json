Uh so it's the Star Wars that my generation grew up with. Um I've said before it's the most expensive Star Wars fan film ever made in a way. And it feels like that. That's exactly what it is. And that you know and then that's you know because George sold it and it kind of opened the door for other filmmakers to come along. And it started with JJ who's you know roughly the same age as me.
