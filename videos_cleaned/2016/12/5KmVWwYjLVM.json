            "text": "Greetings and salutations and welcome to Colin Was Right. Well, sort of. This isn't a proper episode of the show per se, but rather a prologue design to let you know what the show is all about, how it'll look and feel, what inspired it, and perhaps most importantly, what kind of topics the show will cover and how you the viewer will help dictate its course. Back in May, right here in San Francisco, we introduced Colin Was Right to the audience in the form of a quick and dirty video that merely announced its existence but did little else. That's because even internally we were still figuring out pretty much everything else from delivery and writing to graphics packages and flow. We finally answered those questions and so today I want to give you a small glimpse into the final product and discuss how the show came to be, how we see the show rolling out in the present and where we assume the show will end up in the future. We want Colin's Right to be a weekly glimpse into something gaming related.",

We want Colin's Right to be a weekly glimpse into something gaming related. That's pretty much our only hard and fast rule. Sure, we want the show to be informative, thought-provoking, and maybe even a little bit silly at times, but we also want the show to be somewhat unpredictable when it comes to topics and tone. One week I may celebrate my love of the NES, the week after perhaps a publisher did a shitty thing and I'll take them to task, and then the week after maybe I'll mosey on over to why I think mobile gaming is a plague before talking about how much I love GameEx the week after. I want Colin Was Right to be an honest reflection of my thoughts and those thoughts will be good and bad, positive and negative, mirroring exactly what I've been writing and podcasting about as an industry professional for a decade plus.

From a branding standpoint, don't take the name Colin Was Right too seriously. It's a doofy pseudo arrogant joke born from our podcast over the years and it's not meant to be taken literally. I'm outright wrong sometimes and I'm also pleased to be someone who changes my mind and forms new arguments as fresh, compelling, and interesting evidence makes itself known. And while I don't want to blow your mind too significantly, I'm about to. There are even going to be times when you and I disagree, where I say something you simply can't get on board with. That's okay too. I would never do a show design to coddle you or never challenge you. How would that be useful? Where's the fun in that?

I'd be loathed not to mention my pal Gy Sterling and his Well Sterling YouTube show, The Jimquisition. I'm a YouTuber by definition, but barely so and certainly not when it comes to the content I like. I don't watch much else here on YouTube, nor do I really dig consuming Let's Plays or gaming podcasts, but Jim Sterling's amazing commentary on The Jimquisition is a weekly exception to the rule for me. He's bombastic but fair, he's brutal but smart. The Jimquisition is a touchstone for me when it comes to Colin's Right and Jim himself, while we disagree on a great number of things, is an inspiration for me when it comes to intelligent commentary and dry wit. I'm proud to call him a friend and I hope he enjoys the show even half as much as I enjoy his. The other gaming Centric personality that inspires me is seasoned industry veteran Jeremy Parish who I",

The other gaming Centric personality that inspires me is seasoned industry veteran Jeremy Parish who I consider to be the single smartest, most informed, most educational member of the games media. Jeremy takes a different tack than Jim, prioritizing his raw knowledge and keen intellect into something more akin to a documentary than a think piece. As it turns out his YouTube shows Game Boy World and Good Intentions are criminally underviewed and underappreciated, but they're neither underviewed or underappreciated by me. I like what he does and how he does it and is buttoned up approach makes for the perfect balance to what Jim does, peppering the inspiration I receive from these two gentlemen with what I already do just makes a ton of sense to me and I thank them for their hard work and continued contributions to our field.

Outside of games I have to point to two shows in particular, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and Real Time with Bill Maher as landmarks that helped us not only craft a look for Colin Was Right, but to tonally develop the most essential component of our show, the script. Like with Jim, I don't agree with much of what John Oliver and Bill Mars say, but like Jim I respect the out of them regardless. Oliver and Mara are their own men who don't fit as neatly into an ideological box as some would assume. When I do agree with something they say I'm never that surprised because their approach is inherently subjective and they never pretend otherwise. They aren't necessarily aiming for consistency and they don't seem to give a flying who they please and who they offend. They're just trying to tell you how they feel.

There's a final component I want to touch on and that component is you, all of you out there who will watch this show, who will hopefully like it and share it and help it grow. I want you to feel free to leave comments on YouTube with your thoughts on the subjects at hand. If you have something more long form to say maybe even head on to the Kinda Funny forums and sound off. As always you can tweet at me and let me know how much you love or hate me into things I say such has been my reality for many years, but I also want you to tell me what you'd like me to cover.

Let's make Colin Write a two-way street where it's not just me speaking to or at you, but it's all us speaking with one another. Hell, maybe I'll even do a little interstitial answer the comments episode one day, but at the very least I'd love to delve into the topics you want to hear about and not only talk about what I feel is important, relevant, or fun. Just remember that I have my preferences and areas of expertise and there are limits to my knowledge and interests so don't expect me to delve in to MOBAs, building your own PC, or Esports anytime soon. Let me close with this.

Candidly, I've never quite understood my own popularity as a quote unquote personality, nor have I quite grasped why so many people love hearing what I have to say, but to say that my audience has been kind, gracious, and accepting of me is an understatement. Colin Was Right is a culmination not of what I've done, but of what all of you have allowed me to do. I thank you from the bottom of my heart that a product like this could even exist and maybe even thrive and I hope I don't let you down. I really do believe you're going to like the show or I wouldn't be doing it. Look for new episodes of Colin WR each Thursday today right here on youtube.com/kindafunnygames.

Earlier in the fall I sat down and wrote four episodes of the show to begin a production trial run so we could figure out how the show would look and feel and how the editing process would go as I've been thrown into the deep end when it comes to Adobe Premiere. I then sat in the studio and recorded those episodes and I've since been toiling away on their edits. Supporting us at the $1 level will through the month of December gain you access to the three other episodes we shot. I worked hard on these episodes as did Nick and Tim with their graphics packages, technical knowhow, and endless rounds of notes. We want you to watch them and then provide feedback for us at your leisure by posting in the YouTube comments. What did you like, what didn't you like, what would you like to see us keep or change as we move into a regular production schedule at the beginning of the new year.

They were written to be Evergreen, but there are a few quirks in there. Things have changed in recent months and on and on, but their glimpses into what we think the show should ultimately be. They represent the tenor and tone of the show as we see it, but K's right success will rely on all of you and so we hope you subscribe, watch, and give us feedback so we can best tailor the product to all of you out there.
