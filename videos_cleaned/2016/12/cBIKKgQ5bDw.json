It's true. Just stop the story there. I can't get any better while playing Halo Combat Evolved. Now I wasn't playing the single player. I was playing the multiplayer. If you don't remember Halo Combat Evolved didn't have online unless you get a whole crazy ass land like X seed ****. I wasn't doing that. I was playing multiplayer by myself trying to figure out a way to get the ghost to go up the mountain so I can break out of the level. I was planning my strats, my schemy ass strats for some Capture the Flag while I'm doing that ****. This girl didn't know her that well. We had she was sitting on the bed. We were talking.
