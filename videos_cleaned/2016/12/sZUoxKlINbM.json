So this is The Contender, the game of presidential debate about this time last year, I believe, or possibly the Christmas before that. Justin Young sent this in to you, Colin Morardi. Uh, and then and we never ever used it. And then I saw it on the shelf in the spare bedroom cuz now it's very abandoned. And I thought, we should do this as a topic. It'll be great for the four of us. And then Nick's like, \"Too bad you put all your eggs in that basket. I ain't going to be here.\" So, start opening up these things. I'll tell you the rules.

The candidate to the left of the monitor, that'd be you, Tim, responds by playing one, two, or three argument cards while reading the text aloud. After playing, the candidate draws until they again hold five argument cards. Play continues in a circle until each candidate has played exactly three cards. Candidates who do not play all three at once will take several turns. Winning at the end of the round, the moderator awards the topic card of their favorite candidate.
