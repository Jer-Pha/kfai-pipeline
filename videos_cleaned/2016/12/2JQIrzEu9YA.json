It's good to be here with you today. It's good to be here with you today and the pure one, Tim Gettys. Let Tim uh ladies and gentlemen, if you're listening to this or watch on an MP3 version of the show or watching on YouTube, it's important to point out we are doing this live right after the end of the PSX 2016 press conference. So we'll go through, try to fact check as we go, but you know how these posts go. Something goes up, they didn't announce the conference is all there. We're just going to react to the conference though along with you if you're in the Twitch chat. Thank you so much. We'll be pulling questions from there and from Twitter and doing a full show for you. And of course, as I've said before, this is episode 64. It'll go live immediately then on Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. you'll get the the PSX panel that we're doing tomorrow, Sunday at noon.",

Uh before we the conference started, we talked about or something I just said was that I think that for Sony to really make PSX a thing and and for the press conference to be a thing and for people to pay attention, they need to have uh they need to make things pop. They need to have big announcements for people to pay attention outside of us, outside of the nerdy PlayStation kids. You're talking about us exactly and I think they did that. Naughty Dog opened and closed the show. So I thought that that and and Naughty Dog is predict uh a um you know, is is I think pretty easily the best developer in the world um and that's a Sony own studio and so to showcase them um in that way I think is really really bold and I think it's awesome and I think it was a nice",

I don't think it it was you that I think that was your prediction one of them not an official prediction but it was that my prediction was that they would do a playthrough of the Uncharted story DLC and then yeah and that you added what if they end with Last of Us and we're all like that'd be **** awesome and that's what happened. So it's cool to see that um I I I like that they've announced it. I think now they need to do a similar thing they did with The Last of Us on to do disappear for a while and I think that I think they're going to I mean with the with the phrasing of it right Sean Layden saying",

I don't I don't think you'll see any more at E3 probably right? No, I don't think you'll see I I mean I would really love if we didn't see anything about the game until 2018 and then I think it'll probably be a 2019 game so um yeah so it was really really cool to see. I think it looks great. I happy uh that Joel and Ellie are back. We we often conjectured back on Beyond especially a lot about the way the game ends, the original game ends and my my thing was always that I wanted to take part like pick up right after that like to literally be in the ending in the beginning of The Last of Us Two. She looks like she's aged up a bit. Yeah, so she's older. It looks like a few years jump though yeah",

It looks like a few years jump though yeah true true true true um and um good to see them reunited. I think that it would have been I think you could have gotten away with doing a different story in that world. I think that would have been a mistake though and I think that having those touchstones in that world um are really important. I mean obviously the Clickers and everything are are also touchstones in that world and the fireflies but Joel and Ellie are the characters we really care about um and we're getting way ahead of ourselves but my assumption is that they're really going to kill Joel this time to make sure that they don't do another one after this. I think they it's imperative to do this game. I like that they do part two that's a good title for it right and I think that that means that it's going to start right after the game",

I think that there could be some form of time jump to because if you're going to if you're going to do this I do think that they need to make some big moves with it with the story and I think that a good way to get around that could be like this is what's happening time jump a little bit time jump a little bit as you see in The Walking Dead and I want to say so because I'm seeing some of in the chat people are saying it's going to be out in 2018. There's no way this game's coming out 2018. If you if you there's just no way so get that out of your mind now. No way. I think 2019 might even be pushing it so um they take their time uh the resources that clear you know Naughty Dog was two teams and now they're one team again and they kind of move and leave like desperate elements it seems like behind and that",

So this so the team is literally been working on this game for maybe 3 months, four months, 5 months and they're rendering things obviously and stuff like that. So there's absolutely no way in hell the game coming out 2018. So get that out of your mind now. Get it out of your **** faces. Tim, what did you think of the overall conference? Oh my God your dreams continues. I know right is it just a life of dreams now that's I hope so. I hope your Dreams 3 is right around the corner and I think it could be.

I am a little concerned um with the idea of showing so much of it um if we go based on the only other time Naughty Dog has ever done single player DLC you're looking at something that's probably going to be maybe 90 minutes long and they basically just showed you 5% of it you know like if if we're going on that metric and I'm like well that's kind of what's interesting I don't I really don't feel like they should have showed anything I wish I didn't have to see that actually chat chat's calling us out and I want to throw it out there too on Noor's Twitter what",
