I don't, it's good to not play sometimes. I don't see why I wouldn't. There's plenty of downtime, just chilling out, hanging out, living. That's what you do when you're with your girlfriend. You just play video games and she watches some point. Yeah, at some point. Well, I mean, she plays games too. I don't have to worry about watching play games.

I'm going to try to use this time wisely and get through a few games because I, you know, I was looking at my trophies and, and, uh, I've played a lot of games this year. Yeah, like way more than I played last year. And so I'm, I'm happy where I'm at. But there's a few, I, a few boxes I need to, to tick off. Yeah. So, well, for me, it's about getting back to certain things. This weekend, I got back to Song of the Deep, polished that off and 100% of it. But I was mainly just, I hadn't beat it, you know what I mean? I enjoyed it for that weekend, then moved on. Right. At the list behind that is Ratchet & Clank, where I had a **** hell of a time.

Now we got, uh, the Batman episode tomorrow. It's a tight week with content to begin with. A lot of things going on and how I'm going to get in there. The only game that would be in my top 10 list right now that I haven't beaten was Doom. Um, and I got, I got like absurdly far into it. I don't know why I stopped. Something must have happened 'cause I think, I think there's like what, 12 or 14 chapters? Something. I want to say there was like two left. And I was playing it.

Uh, I think I'm going to be spending a lot of time on PSVR. And, uh, yeah. So, you know, I got back to Hitman GO a couple days ago on Vita. And, uh, almost done with that. And then I 100%ed Letter Quest, um, Remastered on Vita, which I can't believe didn't have a Platinum. But I got all the trophies in that nonetheless and beat it. Um, and then I've been playing Hitman, like the real Hitman, uh, just the, the intro level and then Paris. I played it for five or six hours. And what I said on Colin & Greg Live, which was fascinating, was that my girlfriend is like crazy about Hitman, like the real Hitman.

So I'd like to get back and spend time with that. I understand why people, as I said, I think maybe not on this show, but it's on some point, on some shows, to someone. Yeah. Uh, I said that that was the game this year that people had recommended me the most. And, uh, by far. And, uh, I, I, I'd like to, I was trying to pay, you know, heed to that. Um, and, uh, I think it's a very good game. I, I don't know that I, I'm in love with it, but sure. Um, the fine, fine, uh, presentational polish on it, I think, is pretty cool.

Just in the sense, I think it makes more sense for this than it does for The Telltale Game, simply because like there's so much to do on this one map. You're done with a Telltale episode in two hours and it's, it, yeah. Um, this, I mean, you could conceivably play the Paris map for 20 hours, you know? So I think just finding all the different, it's like its own game. Yeah, you know? And, uh, yeah, it's, it's interesting. I like it. I like, I like, I don't have any attachment to Agent 47 as all.

And I like how they tie in the, the, the, the six episodes in the episodic approach to like the Saro 6 and this idea that you have to kill all these guys. Sure. So it's, uh, it's pretty cool. I'm excited. You know, and then we have Final Fantasy XV and The Last Guardian. Although I don't think I'll go back to either of them. I mean, I'm definitely not going back to The Last Guardian. Final Fantasy XV, I think, is, is more, maybe I'll just start it again. What? There's something on your shirt. Looks like a, don't touch it.

It sits in 11th place in gaming hardware sold all time, behind Nintendo 3DS and the NES, both sitting at 61 million sold a piece. If only counting consoles and not handheld, PlayStation 4 is now the seventh bestselling console ever. It's worth noting that three of the six above it are PlayStation consoles. Nice. Um, so should be fine. I, I, I think PS4 will reach 100 million. And where will that leave it then in the, uh, that would leave it around PS1. So just behind Wii and PS2. Gotcha. Wii is about like 101. So that's passable too. PS2 is untouchable. But I, I think that you can get to 100 million. Yeah, I mean, the way they continue to sell, right? The way people continue to care.

As two huge fans of the original, what do you think Naughty Dog were trying to show us in the trailer? I for one am a bit confused. It looks as clear as day that Joel is nothing more than a figment of Ellie's imagination, leading to the conclusion that he meets his death somewhere in the next game. Although predictable, why would Naughty Dog spoil this so early on in a game that's this big, unless of course, they want us to believe in this case?

My question is, what do you think of the story's theme being around hate this time? This is basically a direct contrast to the original Last of Us theme of hope. Do you think that this will completely change the feel of the original game? I'm looking forward to this game whether or not it comes out in 2019. Yours, Hunter Reed.

Do you buy this theory that Joel's dead and that's what she, she's going out to avenge? No. What do you think it's about? Uh, I, I of the mind that it's so obvious that he looks dead in it that, that it can't possibly be. Yeah. Um, because that, why would they give that away? You know? Um, unless the idea is that he dies in the interstitial period between games and we don't really see Joel. But I don't really feel like The Last of Us is complete without him. Um, I think that, you know, and we're going to spoil The Last of Us. You've had plenty of time if you haven't played it. I mean, that's, that's really a travesty.

Um, but since they kept him alive till the end and for reason, you know, the plot is, it's necessary for him to be alive. Um, I just don't know that you can just do it again. And so I think that it's possible Joel dies in the game, but I, I just, I agree that when I saw the trailer, I'm like, it's so obvious that it seems like he's not really there that it could just be a memory or something like that, or she's thinking about him. They're, they're distant or apart from each other for some reason. Um, but I don't want to go down the road thinking that he's, he's dead and he's avenging her necessarily.

Where like the ending for instance of The Last of Us, um, and particularly with the cure, I was always of the mind that there was no guarantee that the Fireflies were going to be able to make the cure. He basically said that that is a guarantee. If I remember correctly, we had be when we did the SPO, and I never got that. And that kind of, um, ruined it for me in a way. Not ruined it.

But I have like my own notions about these particular things that I think are driving the narrative for me as an individual, which I think is the right of the, of the consumer. Um, but it's interesting that he talked about how the first game's about hope because I didn't get that at all. Um, I thought the game was completely hopeless. And so that's an interesting, that's an interesting, it's about love, but it's not about, I mean, to me it wasn't about hope. So, so that's, that's an interesting thing to hear him say as well that the first game's about hope and this is about like revenge or whatever. Well, for me it's through the lens of Ellie.

It's the hope of being able to save him. It's the hope of being a kid who isn't downtrodden by this life. And so for me, that in terms of the next one being hate, I think that it, that's the, the problem I have with the theory, right? Of that. And if you haven't, if you've missed this online, right?

Your belief they were going to kill Sully or desire for them to kill Sully. All these different things. I feel like it's so hard to nail it down that it does seem too direct.

But it for me, it makes sense that the game opens and we've jumped ahead years and it is Joel and Ellie and they are being peaceful and they're doing all these things.

The thing of course is that you could plug anyone into that, but I just don't know if it would have the same impact, right? Maybe the game opens and Ellie has a new girlfriend. Ellie has a new best friend and this is what happens. So the Fireflies come in and kill her and that's, or him or whatever. And we move on that way. And Joel is with her, her for this ride, because he's Joel and he's ride or die. But I still feel like Joel isn't the kind of character that would ask that question.

It's a game that came out around the launch of the PS4, but I don't hear a lot of people talking about it. I'm talking about a fun little 3D platformer named Knack. Knack is a wonderful experience that's fun for the whole family. Kids will be entranced by the quirky characters and gorgeous art style, which honestly puts Pixar to shame, while the hardcore audience will be pulled in by the surprisingly tough and deep combat. It runs buttery smooth. It has a charming script and the level design is better than Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. I just feel like no one has any concrete thoughts on Knack one way or another. This is a shame because it's probably the best first-party game that Sony Studios ever made.\" Well, besides Little Deviants. Thanks, Super Curus, your forgotten PlayStation game, Knack.

During PlayStation Plus of January of this year, one of the games offered was Hardware: Rivals, which was awful, don't ever play it. And two of my friends, friends and I, were trying to Platinum it. We learned that one of the trophies is beating your friend's leaderboard score. So my friend makes a diff, so my friend makes a different PSN account in order to quickly boost for his trophy. His and his name was Cuckleberry Finn. However, we didn't know that he had this idea to make a new PSN idea. So when we both got friend requests saying Cuckleberry Finn would like to be your friend, it was uncomfortable but hilarious. Uh, as a reference, it's a, it's to the, uh, the cuckold fetish.
