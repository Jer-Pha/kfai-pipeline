It says a topic on the nuclear bomb and when do you think all think it'll be news next, but be used and by whom and what the fallout, no pun intended, will be exactly. A good question. You know the answer. Yeah, nuclear bomb that you've already done an amazing documentary about this called Armageddon. Oh, to go after an asteroid. Alright, anyway, so guys, no, I mean, honestly, I think that I don't think that will ever, I don't think anyone's ever gonna use, hope at least, hope they won't, nuclear weapon again unless there's a like a **** planet killing comet that's rocketing toward the Earth and we all have to pilot, get all in nuclear weapons together and send them out there with one Bruce Willis and one Ben Affleck, but this time maybe Ben Affleck will stay and Bruce Willis can come back because he know",

Liv Tyler, main caller from the political landscape. What do you see happening with the nuclear bomb? I think it will be used again. I don't, I don't. So nuclear bomb has not been used since the year that it was finished. Have been tested that way. Yeah, they've been tested thousands of times. Yeah, but in the combat, they've only been used twice, both by the United States. And that, you know, we've talked about in the past, I'm of the mind that we did the right thing. I know that that's a controversial thing. It's not, it's actually becoming way less controversial over time and there's a lot of scholarship that supports that, specifically if you read about Operation Downfall, which was the the operation to take over to invade Japan in late 1945, in 1946, which we anticipated we didn't lose at least",

So in that particular situation, I think that they were used in a righteous way. But we also didn't really know. We had, you know, we didn't start that war. We tried to end it. We asked for surrender and etcetera and so on. And there are arguments that we could have dropped it over Tokyo Bay or something. I mean, like, just look what we have. But we didn't think that that would work. And there's also some geopolitical reasons why we probably did it to scare the Russians who were in it would agree that Yalta to invade Japan from the north and stuff.

So this complicated things about why the bomb was used and it's also complicated why the bomb hasn't been used since. The closest we've gotten to the bomb being used since was 1960 when the Soviets almost bombed us from Cuba Missile Crisis. And that was the amongst other things, the Cuban embargo and all this guy. I mean, there was a lot of fallout, we can, no pun intended, because of that. But I'm not sure that we've gotten terribly close since then to using it. But I do think that it'll be used again to be like Korea. I think as far as state actors are concerned, North Korea is the obvious choice. And I think that this is what makes wacky bastard. This is what makes it's so complicated. They, they first of all, the fissile material and stuff that they have is apparently homegrown.

They have no delivery system of any consequence to deliver them here, but they can certainly deliver them easily to Seoul. They can deliver to Tokyo and etcetera if they wanted to. My assumption is that the country teeters. North Korea, people have said for years, I mean, I read a lot about North Korea. It's like one of the things almost fascinating. But I read almost every book that comes out about North Korea because I'm just so interested in it.

And if that, if it's collapsing from an outside force that, well, they have these nuclear weapons and so they're likely to use, I think, use them and their small yield, like 10, 15 megaton bombs, but that can level a city. Yeah, that's the same power of a bomb that we dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So and Nagasaki bomb wasn't nearly as devastating as it should have been because it fell in a valley and all that. It's all this kind of complicated ****. Wait, could've been way worse. So I think as far as state actors, I think North Korea is probably only one liable to use one.

The fact of the matter is, there's all this material floating in the ether for 65 years and we definitely, no matter what anyone says, we have no idea where all that is. No **** way. You know, we use any material. What are you gonna name your uranium and all the, yeah, which, you know, you have to, it's complicated to, you know, if you go to Oak Ridge, Tennessee or read about Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that a lot of the work for the bomb was done there and it took years simply because they had to figure out how to extract the **** and make it so that it was, you know, able to be detonated in a bomb. And we have two different types of bombs. Little Boy and Fat Man were were different kinds of bombs that worked in different ways with one was plutonium or uranium, I think. But it's not easy to do that in the forties and Back to the Future. I don't recollect any Libyans. Oh,",

So, you know, the bomb was so complicated to make that the Soviet bomb that was detonated, I think in '49, it was a complete copy of our bomb because they infiltrated the nuclear program and stole it, like, stole the plan for the state, a **** facsimile of our bomb. I mean, that was the the quickest way for them to get there and it still took them five years to make it. So the reason I say that is because all of these materials at the height of it, '60s and '70s and into the '80s, we were talking about tens of thousands of bombs that we both sides had, the Soviets and the Americans. And if you look at the graphs, we're down really low. We're down to like a late '50s era or mid '50s era out of bombs. We don't have that many anymore. Did we really defuse all this?

Well, according, according to, I think, SALT and all these kinds of things to start treaties and something. I think that we legally have had to. I think we did. We don't have the money to maintain all these. We don't need them. We have enough bombs to destroy the entire planet many, many times. So we didn't need good. I like to make sure we have full coverage. And I said, I and my car insurance policy, I want to make sure it's if anything happens, we're all good. And as I said on Counter Greg actually this morning, I always loved that our nuclear delivery program is called Peacemaker, which I think is really great. Now that sense of humor at the government, they do. Why was one of the things I want to talk about was, and I'll do it, we'll do one day, was watch country as the best weapon names.

So you guys like everyone has like these unique ways like we name a lot of our stuff after Native American ****. I'm like, Tomahawk missiles. Friends, yeah. So you should also have your Mark 1 for like the operation names. Yeah, operation has been **** hilarious. Downfall and Overlord and Desert Storm and all. Yeah, shot the shotgun honking. Aww. So, so that's my theory is that I think that I think it's very likely that a new, that a nuclear bomb of some capacity is detonated in some place, maybe Western Europe. And even think if it's gonna be a terrorist group, right? It's easier to get to on that landmass. Well, I think that the only, the only thing that I think some folks look at as promising is that if some of these terrorist organizations that are absolutely **** nuts and some of them are apocalyptic, like they think that at the",

They **** hate each other, right? The South Africans had a nuclear program, the only nuclear program as far as we know that was actually voluntarily dismantled, right? They don't have nuclear bombs anymore. Israel doesn't admit that they have nukes, but they do have nukes. What about Iran? Iran is working towards the nuclear bomb. Don't let the Obama administration allowed you. We all know what's going on there. The try what we've been trying to get them to disarm and they're not going to. They're good.

They were paid off to slow down, but they're gonna have the bomb and in, you know, five to ten years, I would assume. And then France has bombs, UK has bombs, we have bombs, Chinese have bombs. I think that's everyone so that we know of. But with all of this loose material going around for 60 years, I'm like, I just don't believe, well, that's quite that we use that we used to have thousands of bombs. Now we were down, we dismantle them and presumably got rid of them. And I think a lot of the shit's like buried. Do you think the plutonium is just sitting on a shelf someplace and I like some one of these days again, it's like the toys that I got not know that Claude, are they gonna do something with this one of these days?

We got to start using the Sun more effectively for just dislike disposing of trash. Now, God, do it. It's alright. There's already nuclear bombs happening every second in the Sun. You see that? But we all remember Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. Yeah, Lex use that exact plan to make Nuclear Man. Every time someone **** quotes Superman IV. Well, you're breaking up the plot of Superman IV.

I don't know how you guys feel about this. We'll get to that, I guess. But the fact that the Soviets and the Americans never launched bombs at each other, never launched nukes at each other, even during the Missile Crisis, when it was pretty clear that it was going to happen. Yeah, you know, they were miles away from us. I mean, they would have delivered it long before we ever even knew what was going on. And they might, how many cells did they have in Cuba? Are you, but but they, but the mobile ones, right? Yeah, well, they like up there and then, yeah, and then our satellite footage like figured it out.

And so the theory is that MAD, mutually assured destruction, is real. Like that theory, that prevailing theory of mutually assured destruction kept everyone safe. And so the theory is that having nuclear bombs is good from that particular perspective because no one will use him. Everyone has them. Yeah, it's that no one will use them because the United States has a right. Like, so everyone has different policies about how to use nukes. We will return a nuclear exchange. Like, we have to have that policy, right? We have that. But the Chinese, for instance, do not have a first strike policy. Like, they won't use one first.

And what's funny is that the Chinese would use their bombs as EMPs and they don't consider that a first strike. So they said if like anything, like if they had a fight, then they would launch EMPs over. They would, I think, invade South Korea and then launch new nuclear bombs and detonate them over the United States to destroy the electrical grid. That still have a fallout though. Does that's not, yeah, it does pretty much.

First of all, we founded that technology. I hate to have to put it that way, but we were the ones who built it. So what you're saying is we should be assuming every other country. No, what I think is what I'm saying, it's not an arrogant at all. I think we over the world to shepherd this technology as long as someone else has, we have to have it.

Yeah, so and you could read about Oak Ridge and Los Alamos himself. Really fascinating stuff, by the way. A really interesting book, by the way, is I think called Command and Control. I read it a couple years ago. It's about all the nuclear accidents that the United States had that almost turned really **** haywire. And they're really, really fascinated. Anyone, there was one, a guy dropped a **** wrench into a missile silo or something like that. And like something happened where the missile like tilted or something.

We, we used to launch our nuclear missiles or we were going, we plan to launch a nuclear missiles over Canada in case that they were shot down so they'd be shot down over Canada, not over the United States. The creative things that people became are like this. Yo, yeah, that makes sense. And I think the crazy thing, I'm getting some of these stories like a little mixed up, my things, it's been a while. But I think we dropped a nuclear bomb, maybe two of them in North Carolina by mistake. Yeah, like in a swamp. And I think one of them is gone. Like, I don't know why. Like, it's just like, and they were saying how like they weren't, they weren't pinned to detonate or whatever. Like, you have them arm them.

It's very serendipitous that it hasn't happened. I think the unfortunate thing is that nuclear bombs have given nuclear power and nuclear energy a bad name. And so I think that that's a really sad thing because it's very dangerous if it goes wrong as we saw with Fukushima, for instance. So I don't, that's where I think. I don't know if you guys agree, but that's where I think then. So I think a nuclear bomb has every possibility being used. That makes, I think it's gonna be us. That makes more sense than my asteroid theory. Probably, probably. It probably quite a higher percentage of that than Armageddon. It's a movie happening.
