You can go to canon.com/gamescasttopic and leave your questions just like my boy Eric did. Eric says, 'Hey guys, first time, long time. Like Colin, I really enjoyed the new War Stories campaign in Battlefield 1. Short, fun vignettes brought a new fresh breath to the growing staleness of modern first-person shooter campaigns. My question, with Star Wars Battlefront II coming next year, do you think DICE will implement a Star Wars-themed War Stories campaign? They already said a single player component'",

They already said a single player component was going to be included, and after playing Battlefield 1, all I want are Star Wars War Stories. Thank you for everything you guys do.' I hope so. Possibly, could be a, could be a move. I think that that's probably solidified whatever they're going to do with it because they did confirm that it'll be a Fall 2017 game. So, um, yeah, I think it's, they said that it'll have a campaign. I hope that it, I don't want the vignette thing to get like played out. There's a play, there's a time and place for that. I want it to be rare. I want, I want a campaign and I, my hope with Battlefront is they give you something totally unique, unique side story. I doubt that's going to happen because Battlefront seems to be more about iconic moments you already know, um, or at least iconic places you've already seen, so it would be weird to like",

But I hope that that's what they do. We'll see. Uh, that's another game like Titanfall that's desperate, in desperate need of a single player campaign and suffered because of it, I think, with some people, even though it sold very well. I think it'd be a great idea to do, to do that. We're going to get, you know, Respawn's Star Wars. We're going to get, um, the millions of Star Wars games. Time out. I've lost sight of this. And what do we know what Respawn's Star Wars game is going to be? Is it a first-person shooter or whatever? They showed a like guy doing motion capture. Okay, I forget. Yeah, it's just coming. They imply that it's an action, I thought it was third-person, third-person action game. Okay, um, so, so we, we got that. And then, you know, obviously we have Amy's",

So with those, I think that the War Stories thing would really fit with Battlefront, um, in, in addition to providing something different than those, 'cause those are going to be the side stories or main stories, depending on how you look at it. Uh, but in addition to that, I think the Battlefront, because it is so kind of based on these iconic moments, I think that in similar to Battlefield, where it's like, all right, cool, you get the tank, then you get the plane thing, then you get the weird armor mission, like each mission's kind of different. I think Battlefront, even, uh, the limited single player stuff that, uh, last year's version had, uh, the one mission had you on the Speeder Bike, one had you in the X-Wing, one had you doing this, and all the gameplay is so different, uh, that I think that it could",

Here's an interesting hour-long Han story, Luke story,' like whatever it is, random character, you know, like, I think that, uh, it could give you some really fun, really was designed gameplay, **** horses, um, but that to me would be the icing on the cake for that. That'd be awesome. It's okay, breathe. You got all Wednesday's almost over. We got a tri, not a trifecta, two. Is there a trifecta for two of them? A duo, a line duo, a pair. But like a good pair, you know? I don't know. I, the trio is just the base. That's a good pair. We got some bazongas. Have a beer, you bastard.

Mine's probably Soulcalibur 5. Thanks for everything you guys do.' And then the next question, Error 45 says, 'Hey guys, first off, why you guys to know you're awesome and you bring joy into my life.' You're welcome. We love you. 'Okay, question time. I was thinking back on how Colin's comments on The Division and how the amount of choices annoyed him during the character creation and thinking how I personally got annoyed with the lack of choice in the game, and it got me thinking.

So I want to ask you guys, is too much choice a detriment or does it allow us to have a deeper connection with the game and character? I, I'm going to tackle this one first. Go for it. Best character creator of all time, I'm looking at it right now, WWF No Mercy. All right, you can say WrestleMania 2000 because that was when they gave you enough choice but not too much. 'Cause right now, like I got WWE 2K17, right? Popped it in, played a few matches. I like, 'Oh man, I'm actually having fun in the matches. Like I'm enjoying this gameplay. I should do the career.' Went to jump into the career. It's like, 'Oh, I wasn't sure if I could just grab somebody and put them in.' Like, 'No, this is still like your story. You got to start at NXT.' I'm like, 'Oh, that's cool.' Like, 'Create a character.' I'm like, 'All right.' I jump in and immediately it's just that overwhelming character creator where I'm like,",

I jump in and immediately it's just that overwhelming character creator where I'm like, 'I want to, I maybe I, when I'm moving things around, I'm like, 'Oh, no, no, this is,' and I just bailed. I'm like, 'This is overwhelming. I can see this is going to be all night just trying to get the face right and do this, how far out the eyebrow can come.' It's like, 'Not, get the **** off. We don't need to be this cute about.' Right? The wrestling ones before, I remember when we made our entire Backyard Wrestling Federation and these ****, you looked at them and you knew who it was. You knew based on the costume choices, you knew based on the face and the glasses or whatever. Like there was enough there where you're like, 'Great, nailed it.' It took me all of 15 to 30 minutes to make what I wanted to make and then jump out and go have fun. You got in like, you know, there's like what, a grand total of 45 moves or",

You got in like, you know, there's like what, a grand total of 45 moves or something. This one, it's like every little animation of how to do it and it's just like, 'Oh ****, man, I don't have time for this.' Now, of course, the, the flip to that is that you can jump online and download other people's creations and like you, it's like Little Big Planet or Mod Nation Racers where you put in all this time, 'Here's something, go get.' But then you lose that thing where it is fun to create your own character and it is fun to feel like you're creating something from the ground up. But when it's just too much and I can't at all deal with it, I'm like, 'Oh man, **** this.' That's why usually I just try, when I started a character creator now, I make Taylor Swift. I need a blonde girl. Okay, D.D., that looks enough. They got the hair stuff. Great. Yeah, you know what I mean? Let's go. That's, I'm ready to",

Yeah, you know what I mean? Let's go. That's, I'm ready to have a **** adventure with T Swizzle. Yeah, I had a similar experience with the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater franchise where, uh, starting with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, that was my first, I think, real introduction, and I think it was one of the first implementations of, uh, character creation and customization. And I loved it because it was simple. And I think that, you know, Tony 3 and even Tony 4 were good in those regards. Once you got to Tony Hawk's Underground and then Tony Hawk's Underground 2 and American Wasteland, whatever, it got a little too crazy where you're just like spending way too much time on these things that don't matter and all the eyebrows and stuff. And I just think it's weird that there's so many options that allow you to do things that are just, they're unnecessary if you're not these artists that are dedicating their lives to all this",

But it's like, why can, why is there seemingly six skin tones and then any color in the rainbow? Like people's skins aren't that color. Like I understand people want to make Frankenstein or want to make like comic book characters, whatever. But it's like that's, that's a bonus, not a 90% of this slider is random **** colors. Right? Uh, and I think that it's just, it's off-putting. And I think a lot of that comes down to the fact that we look at games now and they're, they're so, the fidelity of the graphics is so real and there's all this. It's like back in the day, you could spend 15 minutes because to make your wrestler look like Hulk Hogan, all you needed was, well, you got a little yellow and red, cool. You know, it's more color-based. And Tony Hawk was like, 'Yeah, that guy's wearing clothes that kind of'",

And Tony Hawk was like, 'Yeah, that guy's wearing clothes that kind of look like clothes I wear.' Cool. Their face was flat anyways, it didn't matter. It's just like, great, it's a color schemy looking thing, like a minimalist, uh, idea. But now it's like, you start open world RPGs, one of the reasons I don't like is that intro. Like the only I like more than tutorials is starting a game up being like, 'Oh God, I don't, how fat do you want the lips?' I'm like, 'I don't **** care. Give me four versions of the lips and I'll choose one that looks good enough.' Yeah, but I mean, I get the appeal. I get the people are super into it. And there's, and there's people who, the thing about it again, is if there's enough cool ways around it, what I dug a lot about Mass Effect, and I want, I don't know if it was all of them, I remember Mass Effect 3 was a huge thing where you could get the code, like the",

So people were making Obama and putting it up and like, you know, all these different celebrities up and you could just grab that code and come plop it into your thing and you get it. And that, that was different in the way of like, I know I just made fun of wrestling for that, right? But it was different in the way of like, for Mass Effect, I make, I make your face and then I, what kind of, you're like, your backstory, this. And then we're playing and we're all starting kind of from the same spot. Whereas with wrestling, it's like there's literally like 14,000 **** moves to pick. Now I don't care what his finisher from the turnbuckle is going to be if he doesn't really have one already. There's too much sometimes. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

Whatever you choose that, like, all right, cool. Uh, but yeah, a lot of times they don't do that though. It is just way too, way too much. Um, but I also think that I, I like games when I'm playing as a character and I know that this is how the character is supposed to look. This is the canon of this character you're role-playing. Um, but then there's certain times where in certain role-playing games, like I think Pok\u00e9mon's a good example where I want the Pok\u00e9mon characters to have a look. Um, I feel like obviously I'm a little bit more, more attached to the first couple generations than the later ones. So like the look of those characters to me is like, cool, I like those.

The newer ones, I'm a little bit more, uh, take it or leave it. But, uh, in introducing X and Y, you could change your clothes and go to stores and stuff like that. And they kind of made it part of the game. And I enjoyed that. I enjoyed the like being able to change your outfits and like looking forward to customizing my character to be how I wanted them to look because it was part of the game. Um, so I think that that's the difference to me is like, I, I don't want to just from the beginning of the, you know, choose a whole bunch of options that don't affect anything. Like it doesn't make me feel more connected to the character. It just feels like I'm doing **** just because it's a video game. You're supposed to do things, of course. Right?

How many books do you read where, where they talk about the protagonist and they don't describe him because he's a **** character that exists in the world? Like you don't read a book and they're, they never say that, you know, he puts his hands through his brown hair or whatever and he wears his red cloak as he go.

And like that little tweak is enough for me to be like, 'Oh, I kind of own this character. I made this thing to look like this.' Yeah, I think I'm kind of hypocritical on it too when I think about it because like I, I want it to be simple and easy. But whenever it is, I'm always like, 'Oh, I wish just let me do this or this.'

Um, had a lot of, lot of fun with that. Never played the game correctly, but definitely had a lot of fun. My memory of Sim City 2000 is that somehow I, I acquired this CD-ROM of all the Genesis games someone gave me. Okay. And I traded it to my friend Eric for his copy of Sim City 2000.
