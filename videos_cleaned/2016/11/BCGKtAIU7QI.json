Like a laser. Can you make a laser come out of it, Kev? So, topic two, yes, comes. I was literally just texting from Patreon.com/kindafunny where our good friend Aziz, of course, hit us up with a topic. He supported us for a month, got his topic on the air, and his topic is, how far can goodwill or bad will affect a future project? He says, e.g., movie, show, games. He has a bunch of examples, right? Inafune seems to have lost the goodwill he ever had with this this year with the release of Mighty No. 9 and ReCore. How far, how will this affect his things, his future projects? Uh, then he says, because of Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman, people are not as excited, or I'm sorry, people",

How far do you think this will affect DC? And then he goes on to Marvel and like, so now we're, we're right in the same wheelhouse here. So that's the, the, I am I, and when it comes to popular opinion on the DC Cinematic Universe and me giving them rope and like, no, no, no, they're trying to be grounded. Batman v Superman's going to play on that. You're allowed to laugh, you're allowed to smile. I see fight in it. But like that, like that was always my thing, right? Of like, you were disappointed Man of Steel, fine. The trailers for Batman v Superman look like they're dressing that head on. That's an awesome thing.

And for them to say, no, no, no, it's not Snyder being stupid, this is the universe you exist in where it's darker and it's real and it's, and that totally didn't work out. You know what I mean? Like the movie sucked on its own without Zack Snyder being at the helm of it, right? So I do feel that I worry that Wonder Woman, I, I think there's goodwill behind Wonder Woman that'll benefit it because not Snyder, everybody like, you know, everybody, it seems like it's like one of them was awesome in Batman v Superman.

There's been bad will behind them forever. You're just copying Marvel. You're late to the game. Why are you doing this? So every time they come out, they are nickel and dimed for everything they do wrong. And they do a lot wrong, don't get me wrong. But these movies get put under the microscope and really **** torn apart. Whereas like, I criticize Civil War, right? And it was like, what are you **** talking about? I'm like, okay, sorry.

I think Justice League has a chance to be better than the critically and received by the community because I think it's going to be what people always want. And that's hat in hand, you were right. It's going to be Snyder and the cast. They're going to have to answer this question on every **** interview they do from here until the Justice League, probably, of, hey, we heard you loud and clear. You, you didn't like what we were doing. You didn't like this. We're making it lighter. We're putting humor in there. This is written from, this is, this is planned from Ground Zero that way, rather than Suicide Squad where it was like, oh ****, there's, there a bad reaction there. Let's get some reshoots in there.

Suicide Squad is going to be Suicide Squad. Oh ****, it can't be. Do this. No, it's too late. You're too late on trying to build your universe. You're doing it too fast.

Everyone's going to go into that and you're talking about the microscope. I feel like it's, it's not even so much a microscope as much as just looking like, making sure you have glasses on. Like, because it's, when you're talking about the Marvel movies, uh, you get criticized because people go into the Marvel movies based on their track record of, um, how good's this one going to be, you know?

And I don't think that Zack Snyder or any of them are going to change a single thing. I don't think there's a hat in hand at all. I, I mean, they already did with like that, I mean, like the, the long footage of Justice League was pair, was the what came out a week and a half after that studio set visit. They brought a bunch of journalists to in there. They were saying that like, we want you to watch us film this, this Bruce/Wally scene. We're trying. But I mean, I think that's, it's marketing.

It's, it's more of a distraction than an answer. And I, I just think that like, there's at this point, because of the, because they've spent so long building this universe, they're **** like, they're already down this path. You can't all of a sudden change things. Like we were talking about Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. Like, it's been so long that him being the Wolverine that we need him to be is impossible. In the same way, it's like with Justice League. Well, now there's a whole bunch of characters that are going to be together. This is going to be Batman v Superman. Oh, like, there's no way around that. No way. Yeah, and it's the question is going to be, is it better than Batman v Superman or not? It's not going to be, is this movie",

I think, I think that audiences hold grudges up until the point where you give them something really good. So if for any reason, Justice League was just by some miracle, I don't think it will be, but by some miracle, **** amazing, I think you would get every single person back on board on that train. Asa, like, like that. I just don't think that like, I, you see time and time again, people try things or they, or they fail these projects. And yeah, people love to hate, but you know what we love even more than that? Redemption. We love redemption.

Not like I made posts and went out and picketed or something. But First Class came around, you're like, oh ****. But there's differences though. And the difference there is that was a reboot. That was a different set of directors. And that was after a significant amount of time. Not a reboot, but it was a re-kind of, yeah, but in their mind, building the Days of Future Past, then reboot. First Class was a reboot of X-Men. It's just, it was still in the same timeline, but it was still a reboot of the franchise.

But it wasn't until Days of Future Past that they're like, cool, we can make this work in parallel universes because that's what comics do. And we're at a point where a moviegoing audiences can understand multiple, uh, timelines and like, this is Marvel 616, this is Marvel whatever the hell. As a casual fan, I didn't understand that. The, I thought Days of Future Past was a prequel to X-Men, the Bryan Singer movies. And so it went through and then when we got to Days of Future, it is, it is.

Um, and I, Fantastic Beasts, I'm like, he's a really good actor. What's the movie I saw where he was having sex with something else too? I can't remember what it was. Look, I'll look it up. You guys keep talking. Big Kev's on it. Looking. Just, I like, he keeps popping up in random things. I'm like, is that the **** Flash? That is the **** Flash.

He was like, was he, was the one she was, he was at his mom's house, right? Or whatever. Uh, yeah, what I, what I appreciate at a from two **** seconds of Ezra Miller is The Flash in that Justice League thing where it gets to talk is that he doesn't sound like Grant Gustin. He's clearly some other, he seems like he's an indoor Kid Flash. You know, he's got all his Rick and Morty things playing and he's sitting there and he's socially awkward and he's very different. And I like that idea of a character of like, okay, cool, what's going to happen with that?
