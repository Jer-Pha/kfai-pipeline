Tim, yes, tomorrow, Saturday, is Extra Life. We are streaming for 4 hours, raising money for the Children's Miracle Network, all the hospitals for the big, beautiful kids. Uh, we'll be all playing different games and I'm going to be playing at some point WWE 2K17. And what I said is I want to start the career because I actually like the gameplay from what I played a few matches, Xavier Woods, our friend. Um, I like the gameplay. I wanted to start a career, but I didn't want to create myself. I wanted to create the one and only Big Kev Dog, Kevin Coello. Who so I put out a call on Twitter for people to make me Kevin and then we'll pick one and play with. Four people answered the call. If you're looking at the screen right now, the Superman is by 50 Cent. The one in the Team Kinda Funny Extra Life shirt is lovesthev69. He looks like Colin Kaepernick.",

Okay, we put them into a Fatal Four-Way for the WWE Intercontinental Championship of 1990. We're not playing, we're just going to watch this. Let's Play is a Let's Watch. It's a Let's Watch of we're going to decide whose costume we like the most, whose entrance is the most uh authentic to Kevin. Can I just say before we even get into this, this is my nightmare. Four Kevins. There's four Kevins now. It is when we look over at the the Kevin here in the Kinda Funny shirt, that's the, you know, the blue Kinda Funny words on it. Does that make sense?

I can obviously change that. I really want a Mick Foley flannel, which Kevin does wear, except it's blue. Yeah, which I have a blue one. I only wear the red one though.

It's all working in conjunction. Bear, he has the watch. Nobody can hear you, Nick. Come up here and say these look so dirty. It's because of how they took it. They took the photo.

Kevin ain't doing no crazy ass flips off the top. Hey, you put me in a pool, I'll do a flip. You pool, you're in ring. You put me on a ring, I don't know what I'll do. I've never been in a ring.
