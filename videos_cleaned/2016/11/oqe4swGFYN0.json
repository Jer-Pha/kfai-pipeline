The producer Seducer, Nick Scarpino. Sorry, I was doing a little light reading. Uh-huh. Read me a little bit of the an excerpt there from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Uh, this is the definition of the uh, Hippogriff. The Hippogriff is is native to Europe, though not found worldwide. It has the head of a giant eagle and the body of a horse. It can be tamed, though this and this part is underlined, which is nice. You've been taking some notes in this. Uh, it can be tamed, though this should not this should be attempted only by experts. Whoa, whoa. Are you really making notes in the margins of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them? Not 'cause there's three different books. There's three different books that come out and each one has different students' notes. So the Quidd, oh, I see. So this is not you, this is actually in the book. Yeah, it's second. I thought super",

Oh, then the then the one one the penultimate Harry Potter book, the last one when I was still in Missouri. I went to with the one where Dumbledore dies. That is six. Okay, well, I went and pick that one up and and what I did is she drove the car home and then I jumped to the final 10 pages and read the final 10 pages and gave it back to her. I didn't say anything. I just knew it would drive her crazy and it did. And that's why we're not together 'cause I did things like that. So yeah, I've seen all the movies, never read the books.

Yeah, my mom, huge Harry Potter fan, has been since day one because of that and also because of the the age group that I grew up in. I was in fourth grade when the first book came out, maybe fifth grade. Uh, then the movie came out. We all went to see it. I saw the first movie, I saw the second movie. Uh, read the first book 'cause in school that's what you did. Um, now that's that's pretty much my experience. I I went I was there for the midnight release of every book, but that was to get my mom the book. It was always a thing. It was never my thing.

So uh, so but so to clarify this though, you haven't read the last book. How many times have you read the other books? So I don't count like what you say in school. I know I did read the first book in school, but I don't remember it at all and I didn't remember it when I went back and reread um the first book. But since I've, you know, came back to the series, I've read the first book, I want to say at least four times. Um, and this is the last year and a half. And then the second book, I've read, I think twice. Third book, I read multiple times just because I I couldn't the time travel and all that confused me so much that I had to go back and forth.

But I've read um the first book the most times just because the Illustrated version eventually came out. So I had so much fun just like finding a little Easter eggs in that, going back to it. So but I just love that you haven't you're just hold the reason you haven't read the last one is 'cause you just don't want it to end. I can't. You know, 'cause like I started um reading it like I said because of Voldemort. So I opened the first one being like, I want to see how he got here. Like, you know, and every question I had had an answer and I didn't expect that because you never go into a series and think you're like, you know, with all the questions you have running your head and think they're going to all be answered.

Like I need some kind of room to like go go online and turns turns out he speaks snake revealed in the final book. No, that was actually a first book. First book, they uh they talked about that. You know what, we'll agree to. Okay, cool. So so we all just saw Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the first of five movies that are going to be coming out uh in the new in The Wizarding World Cinematic Universe. Very important.

I couldn't I grinned as soon as it start like it puts up the Warner Bros. You're flying through like this is actually I've missed this.

Um, and I like that there's sort of a competitiveness there that's built in. Um, and I like that they really had these fleshed out characters. It felt like you were you were watching um a movie that was based on one of her books. Um, the only thing that could have been better was actually reading the book first. Like if she had written that book first and then seeing the movie. But but it had a lot of the depth that I think a lot of the books uh had in them. I don't know if it had the depth.

Yeah, sure. Greg, without spoiling anything, uh, I love the way they were dressed. I think that added so much to it. Just like the 1920s. I guess is that how they dressed back then? I don't know.

I understood in the story how it made sense, but I feel like it took away a little bit to me. So like this, they kind of feel like they're in a an outfit or uniform. So I like that. Mhm.

You see Aurors and those Aurors very much look like they belong in that World of Harry Potter. You come to the United States, they look like feds. You know what I mean? Like they have they talk like cops, they act like cops, a lot more staunch. They're not they're not like whimsical um like some of the Aurors you saw like Order of the Phoenix, things like that.

Um, and you saw him put the Deathly Hallows on uh the Flash's character, Ezra Miller's character. Um, so it's cool to see how that's going to go. And it and it's fun. I mean, look, the fact of the matter is the Harry Potter uh movies had had a great run. There was seven or eight of them for Christ sake. Um, and so we've seen that story unfold. So now it's kind of fun to see to play around in that universe and to see these other characters that we've only like read about or or seen on the cover of books or had Hermione talk about a little bit here and there.

Greg, you ask me what a Casper mattress is. Hey Tim, what's a Casper mattress? It's a mattress that's engineered at a shockingly fair price. If you didn't already know, it's just the right sink, just the right bounce, two technologies in one. Yeah, you heard it before, haven't you? I have, but I for a second I thought I was made of ghosts, so I'm glad this isn't that. Nope, it's a different Casper, totally different Casper. We're talking latex foam and memory foam coming together for better nights, brighter days. Me and Greg, Nick, I don't know if you heard this, we just got a new apartment, congratulations.
