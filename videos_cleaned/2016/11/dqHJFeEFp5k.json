We recorded videos that are going to, that are going to play at GameStops across America. Uh, so that's kind of cool. Are there GameStops in other places? Canada, I think. Yeah, but I don't, I don't know if these are, I thought the, the verbiage was very clear that we had to be like about America, about America, maybe the best country in the world. Might heard UK. UK got that. They got that weird, weird GameStop game game the ****. They forgot the stop. Noot. I like that. I like that a lot. On if you didn't know, this is the Kinda Funny Gamescast.

So let's get right into it. What y'all been playing, Big Call Daddy? Uh, few games. I, I played all the way through Battlefield One on hard. Um, got all the codes, got all the Battle, uh, uh, or Field Manuals. So I got all the Collectibles. I have every single player trophy. Uh, jumped online for a few hours, started playing it there. I like it. I want to get back to it. Um, maybe presses here on route to platinum. Yeah, it's good. It's, you like the multiplayer? Yeah, it happens once every couple years.

But uh, yeah, I, I, so I, I really spent quite a lot of time with Battlefield One and I really think it's one of the great games of the year. I, I, we've talked about it already. We talked about more cursory way with giving our impressions of it from early on. But I think the vignettes are fantastic. I think, uh, the storytelling is awesome. It's diverse. It gives you different perspectives from, um, different Allied perspectives, including BNS and and uh, ETC American perspective, uh, which is cool. Uh, kind of through a British lens. So I think the storytelling is really good. I think Dice deserves a lot of credit. I think I play a lot of shooters, single player campaign campaigns, and that is one of the great stories I've",

I started, I committed into it to actually start into it and play through. Colin likes the story so much and that's what I like the most about video games in general. I'm in the tank one right now, the one we talked about with the pigeon and stuff. But even like, I guess an hour into that, hour and a half maybe or whatever the hell. I miss totally the same thing of like, man, this is actually awesome. I mean, the games obviously through the intro to this thing, this is actually really, really cool. I am invested in what's happening to these guys' world and where it's going to go and what's going to happen. Yeah, it's very cool.

That one's, uh, yeah, he's telling the story of his friend, um, Matt Mato, I think. Um, yeah, so I, I jumped in. I, I think, you know, there's a lot of gameplay diversity there. I, I really think, um, mechanically, I mean, we'll see. I played a little bit of Titanfall, which I'm sure we'll talk about because Greg's beaten it. Um, and then Call of Duty, uh, I have it. It's just I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet. That kind of trifecta along with Doom. I think pretty good year for shooters, um, which is awesome because it's one of my favorite genres.

It's just a great, it's, it's a great term. Um, and you're an F, a black FBI agent, a woman in 199. Um, and it's about, uh, a time in your life, uh, specifically with your partner who, and I don't want to get too, it's kind of spoilers because the game is only 90 minutes long or so. Um, there's not much, uh, PS4. I think it's on Xbox One and PC. Um, so on PlayStation 4, you have to beat it twice and get some Collectibles and stuff. I just did it all in one afternoon, basically. Uh, I really like it a lot. Again, I think the ending is a little vague.

When you beat Virginia, you got to sit there and, uh, reflect on everything that happened, try to draw some conclusions, find some interesting things online. I beat it a couple weeks ago. I enjoy it, but it's an interesting one. I think worth pointing out, not a spoiler, of course, but no dialogue in it. Yeah, yeah, no dialogue, which a different time. Yeah, nobody talked to them. It was, yeah, no, no talk, no dialogue written or verbal. So I think that that's pretty neat. So a lot of it is, is, uh, you're just getting it through facial expressions and all that kind of stuff. We, I played with and we, we both really enjoyed it. I, I, um, it, it kind of, you know, I was really left disappointed with Firewatch. I thought Firewatch was not very good.

I mean, I, I, what I mean, yeah, no, I was going to say, what are we comparing it? And I'm like, yeah, well, we all probably, yeah, I guess voice think Firewatch is better. But, uh, no, in terms of the story and the pacing and the payoff, I was way interested in more of that than I was Firewatch. Cause Firewatch, I mean, that's the whole thing for us, right? Where it's like, oh, man, this is interesting. Where is it going? Wait, this is what this game is about. Oh, this, it's over. What the ****? What the hell was all this about?

Uh, and, uh, and I messed around a little bit, you know, and it tinkered with World of Final Fantasy on Vita. And that's a slow burn. I'm a couple hours in. I don't know how I feel about it yet. Uh, it's, it doesn't seem to be very divisive. Some people really like it. It's basically like a light, like a Pokemon game. I think it's, uh, in, in a way, yeah. Uh, but I think, uh, it's a little deeper. I'm surprised it's for children in a way because not from the subject matter. It's very, you're playing as chippy characters. It's very cute.

And I think the same thing could be said there. But I don't really have any, any, any thoughts there. And then Titanfall, um, which I'm sure Greg will talk about, um, just for about an hour last night. I'm playing it on Master difficulty. Um, so it's a little bit slow going for me. Uh, I think the, the, the gun play is great. I mean, my, my very early impressions, I didn't play the original Titanfall. Um, I think the gun play is great. I don't really typically care about parkour, care for parkour in first person. Um, I think there are some exceptions. I think Dying Light's a great exception for that because I think it did it, you know, CL did",

I wish it was just a shooter where you're getting a mechs and then get out of the mech and keep shooting. So I'm not wild about that. But, um, I'm also very early and uncomfortable with the controls. So, you know, that might change in time. So that brings us to topic one of the day. Greg, I played so many things this week though. You, oh, okay. I played Shu. I want to talk about Shu. I want to talk about WWE 2K17. Looks dope. Played Battlefield. You played, oh, WWE. I think he said NBA. I was like, what? Oh, yeah, I just all of a sudden wanted to get right into that NBA 2K17.

You know what I mean? We'll come to Vita when it, when it's ready for Vita, which is always fun. But yeah, it's, uh, you know, this is of course the, when it got announced, we all so into it at IGN because holy ****, it's a game where we got to take Shu Hosa's face and put it on that character. But yeah, it's, uh, running from one end of the screen to the other, platforming around, getting coins, avoiding death, going on or not coins, but Collectibles or whatever. It's a call back to me to a simpler time, but really beautiful so far. I'm going to get back to and play more of it. But I might do the thing and wait for Vita.

Yeah, I saw, uh, you sent me a code and I looked at a trailer for it and it looks great. The animation, something's weird about it where it looks kind of warpy and like it looks like it was animated in, um, I don't know, in a very simplistic way. And yeah, that is the style to it. I don't, it didn't pull me out, make, I, I didn't look, go, oh, this looks warpy or something. But it is a very distinctive style, I think, personally, to it. But it's kind of turned me off just from looking at it. But ****, I am a hater. But I like platformers. So hopefully it's good enough for me to not hate it. Greg, Titanfall. You played it. You beat the single player. How much multiplayer you played? Just before this, hit level seven in multiplayer. So not a whole hell of a lot. But enough that I know that I like it a lot.

And the fact that I'm not a shootery guy. Shooters rarely click for me. I'm not a big first-person shooter. Something about the storytelling mechanic doesn't work for me. Um, however, that said, Titanfall, the original Xbox One, was the one that I saw at events. I played at events. And I was like, holy ****, I want to really play this and really get into it. I mean, you know, putting our jokes aside from Conor G. Glass and all the other shows, right? Because Colin was like, you only played it for a month. I played it for a month and a half.

I mean, it's Killzone before Titanfall. Probably would have been Killzone, whereas the one where I really invested in a first-person shooter online multiplayer structure. Um, month and a half regen. I think I got halfway through the second regen, which is like, you know, prestiging or whatever in Call of Duty. Um, big fan. Uh, the problem was that a month and a half in, it was the same thing over and over again in Titanfall. There wasn't that depth of content. There wasn't, uh, wealth. There wasn't something you really wrapped, uh, your arms around in love forever, right? And I always tell the story of that.

And then Alfredo pulled me in because Alfredo, of course, we had done a whole thing at IGN of him teaching me to play first-person shooters, him teach getting me ready for Titanfall. And he brought me in to show me the new content. And they had added so many modes. And it was like they had a basically a Horde Mode against the computer where you could play your friends. Like, oh, holy ****, this is actually awesome. And he's like, yeah. And I'm like, did this bring people back to Titanfall? He's like, no, they put out all this cool content and nobody cared. I'm like, ****, I hope when they come out with Titanfall, that's in there and that's packed in there. So now jumping into Titanfall, I've beaten the single player campaign. I'm playing multiplayer.

Is that the people who are talking about how great it is and how much they're fun they're having with it. And again, I'm not saying these are bad. We're going to get into what I'm talking about here. Uh, they are the minority on the internet as well though, right? This game is not selling. It doesn't matter that it's a critical darling. Doesn't matter that all these people are saying they like it a lot. It's not moving units, which is sad.

But more importantly, I think it's a game that doesn't have an identity anymore. And that's, I think, my problem with it and what's most heartbreaking for me. I jumped in to single player, uh, and immediately was underwhelmed. And this is one of those, you know, downsides of not getting to it until after the weekend. I was in Montreal, right? So reviews had posted. Kids online were already playing it. People we were, Alex O'Neal, friends like that. And so, so many of them. And I'm talking about like, you know, Austin Walker too, and Jeff Gerstmann, who are saying like, holy ****, this Titanfall single player is on another level. This is so amazing.

I want to get spoilery about the mechanics. Uh, these are the things that, you know, really set it apart and do all these different things. And even rolling credits last night, I was just like, this was fun. But it wasn't like amazing.

But even here where there like some of the, you know, one of the ones they talk about a lot is like Inception, right? Because there's this one thing where you're running through a factory that's building out these like, I think they're, they're either, it's poorly explained, at least from what I remember of, if it's going to, you get used him in like a diorama fight. Like you're fighting other people. But I'm unclear if you're, this is just something that's building housing things that are being shipped out to like, you know, wherever the hell they're putting these things in.

No, more like Inception. If it was just like stuck on a wall like this and you're running through it that way. Again, it's cool. Titanfall, this, this one amplifies the parkour, the running on the walls, the, the slide of running into an area, sliding, shooting everybody like vanquished, which I really did like.

And I didn't feel like I needed to use it in that mechanic. Maybe I should have cranked the difficulty up. But again, I'm just playing through to have fun to see what the story is all about. Um, people kept hanging their hat on the fact that, you know, it's you, the pilot, and BT, the Titan himself, right? And he has this robotic personality. You get to talk.
