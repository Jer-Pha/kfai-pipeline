Have you seen some of the critically acclaimed ones like Iron Giant or Inside Out? I feel like in most recent years, people love to complain about how there are no original ideas in movies, but there have been plenty of original stories portrayed in recent films, parentheses, such as ParaNorman or Kubo and the Two Strings.

And they're like, go see Iron Giant. I'm like, no, that isn't a Superman film, and it's about a robot. Fuck you. But it has been, I'm just surprised by, isn't Iron Giant, isn't Iron Giant like 15 years old now? That's pretty old.

But I'm not thinking I'm going to make the best Superman movie of all time. I bought a robot. I'm going to put Vin Diesel in there. When he gets to Groot, you're like, that's really funny.

Like, we usually see nowadays, CG movies is just all that's what animation is. It's just like glorified video game cutscenes.

Which one? Uh, Kubo. What is Kubo about? I don't understand what it's about. So Kubo is, it's this kid, and there's this a lot of backstory about his grandpa killing his, um, his grandpa's really bad, killed his dad, and he needs to live with his mom who like ran away and is hiding him.

And the stop-motion animation was like, they really took it to a next level, 'cause there was actually at fight scenes. Like, it wasn't just like the typical, it blows your mind when you think that people had to do that, like little movement by little movement, frame by frame. And, and then in the credits, they show you them doing it. Yeah, fuck wild. It takes years. It makes you appreciate it that much more.

I think that Pixar is the golden standard, and I think they are the ones that do it right. And I think that overall, there's been a lot when it gets to the sequels, more often than not, they're not great. Uh, Toy Story is the one exception. I think the Toy Story Trilogy is perfect. It's one of my favorite movie trilogies of all time. But when you look at Cars, when you look at Cars, Monsters University, not a bad movie, not a good movie. Cars One was good. It was terrible. No, Cars One was good. Did not like that movie. Uh, but Cars was, was, was bad. Let me tell you something",

Uh, but Cars was, was, was bad. Let me tell you something about Cars real quick. Uh, my daughter had to get a cavity filled, and so they gave her night the gas. And um, they said, what's your favorite movie? We'll put it on. And she says, Cars 2. And I was like, no. And then um, so they put it on. A year later, I fuck you not, she has to get another cavity filled. We go in, gas is on. What's your favorite movie? We'll put it on. Cars 2. And I'm like, how did we come to this? How is this happening? You need to raise her better, Colin. Son saying his favorite game is Sonic the Hedgehog. Like, you need to raise them right. My God. I would send that away in seconds. That put, put him back in. But Inside Out is a movie that I feel like maybe I'm dead inside because I didn't like it as much as people, other people liked it.

And um, I don't know if that's because I'm a mom, and so I see it through a different lens. All the people that I was listening to, they're like, oh my gosh, it's so sad about this part. And I was watching it, and I was thinking, that's just not sad to me. I don't know why. And I feel it makes me sad when I don't have those emotions, 'cause I want to experience what other people are experiencing, but I also want that to be genuine. I don't want to, you know, try to force it. Do you feel like that was because that particular movie was a little aimed more toward younger kids? Like, kids probably. I don't think that was necessarily for adults. I think that movie was written as like a, hey, really? Yeah, I think that that movie had some real adult themes and some real complex things to understand too. But to me, there, it was the whole point of that movie was to tell kids that if",

Um, I didn't think that like, personally, I think I'm on your level too, where I didn't, I don't think, and um, maybe it's because I'm not suffering from something like that, but maybe I, I just didn't, I didn't vibe with it. It didn't get me. And in much the same way, it got every five-year-old that was in the theater, though, crying their asses off. Yeah, see, what's interesting about this, I mean, I've read a lot about the, all the, the movies, and it sounds like Inside Out was the one that didn't hit with the kids as much as the rest of them.
