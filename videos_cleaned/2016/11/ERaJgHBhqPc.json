Come back up just a sec. Then you can go back down. Look at the definition he's getting in here. This belly. He's looking real good, real good. I like the colors of the shirt. It's Gamescast colors.

It's all I want to do. Tim, so you're playing yesterday, I saw and I was, I was asking you how the single player going and you're saying you're just doing who the **** knows how the single player's going. I run around doing all the side stuff. I'm just collecting non-stop because it's just one of those things that I'm doing so well at getting the research points and unlocking the new things on my trees.

And then I'll actually do some of these goddamn story missions. Get in there, see what DedSec's up to. Cause the ones when I do stumble in one, when I want to shake it up, as they say, and I go in there and do a little bit, cause you know, they have, they have a nice little progression bar. You of when you're going to your little DedSec app, you can see every mission you have available to you, how far you've gone in them, because they're like narrative based or whatever, which I really like.

Like them getting, I forgot what I got from IGN, but it was some like a 6.5, it was in progress review. I don't know if they've updated it. A 6.5 in progress review is not good, you know, for a game that needed an eight to be relevant to, to those people. Obviously the people that want are going to play it anyways.

I've been out of that for so long. Like, and everybody, a lot of people talk a lot of **** about me because I'm like a Gen 1 when it comes to it. And it's like, I love Red, Blue, Gold, Silver are my favorites. Ruby and Sapphire, great. Diamond, Pearl, pretty good. Black and White, I kind of fell out of. Black and White 2 were great.

I just enjoy playing through the game, maybe playing with my friends once like a little bit and call it a day. So for this to be coming out, I was like, I don't know that I need another Pokemon right now. Like X and Y years ago at this point. Uh, I played and I thought that that was the right time for me to get back into Pokemon. And it was, it was a great time. And then they announced the, uh, Ruby and Sapphire remakes. And I was like, oh, that's cool. I liked the Hoenn region back in the day. But like, wasn't motivated to play them again.

We still called it an NX. Never forget. Exactly. And for me, I'm like, all right, cool. There's all this news about Nintendo kind of having a fresh restart and going forward on that. So it felt like a weird back step for them to have another full generation of Pokemon on the 3DS. But then now that we kind of know everything, I think it makes a little more sense. Uh, because it's the 3DS. Nintendo needed something this holiday. And they had the NES Classic. But obviously they really misplanned that.

Like I, I really need to eat my words on them a bit because, uh, Nintendo has been listening and Sun and Moon is kind of the culmination of a lot of this type of fans' problems with the game. Uh, things like HMs taking up move spots for, for Pokemon and just kind of getting in the way and requiring you to, to have Pokemon that are just there in your party for HMs and nothing else. They got rid of that because now there's this Pokemon Ride feature where you essentially have this pager and you can just, uh, call a Charizard. It's not your Charizard, but it's like Uber kind of.

So you don't need to use the Poke scul. Is surge pricing for these guys? Uh, there's no surge pricing. It's unlimited use. You, it's, and you get them pretty early on too, which is, which is great because it, it just feels like this game respects the fact that they know that most people playing it have played Pokemon before. Cut the **** and get you right into it. It's cutting a lot of the **** and it, it really kind of, there's a lot of features that keep things fresh but familiar. Yeah. Um, sometimes too familiar.

Uh, but has some, some cool features and story-wise, they did some things that I thought were, uh, really fresh. And there's no gyms in the game. And a lot of this stuff has been out there for a long time. But I haven't been reading about it. Like I'm calling a Greg live will like top level look at a headline and make fun of stupid designs or whatever. But all the tropical guys, all they didn't they do a lot of tropical guys this one? Yes. Like forms. Exactly. Here's a Charizard and a pineapple and they **** and now we got this thing. Exactly.

Everybody wants to catch the Pikachu and whatever. So then the generations that are just all new ones, like Ruby and Sapphire were, or like, um, X and Y were, or Black and White were rather. You go in and there's just a whole bunch of new Pokemon that there's a bunch of grumpy people like, great, it's another bird that's not a Pidgey. It's another rat that's not a Rattata.

So the Alola forms, uh, it's, you're still getting Vulpix, but now it's ice type instead of fire or whatever. So it's like those type of things are nice. But in addition to that, the game even from early on switches up what you'd expect. So everybody that's played Pokemon knows that you get the Pidgeys and Rattatas early on. In this game, you can catch ghost types. You can catch water types, fire types in the second area of the game. And I'm like, holy ****, they're really opening this up to be a different type of experience. Um, while still giving us the, the old, a nice mix of new and old.

Uh, then the, the biggest change is that there's no gyms. And instead of gyms, there's a thing called the, the Island Trial Challenge or whatever. So that there's four different islands in the game with a couple little like side islands that don't count as full ones.

So I don't understand how that equates to $250. I don't understand how people are doing that math. Wholesale means that that's the price in which the they're buying massive amounts of consoles at one time. They're not going to then turn them around for a no profit. So I don't understand. I'm just a little confused about how people got from point A to point B on that. So that's that's that's where I'm that's that's the only thing I'm a little confused about from what you were reading.

Kevin hit his knee real hard. So when we wait for that answer the one thing that I will say is that when I was reading this this is what I'm talking about the bad news starting to come out like your big bundle is Splatoon and I'm not denigrating the game people love it my brother **** raves about that game um but you're bundled in game as a Wii U game and then you're well it's not a Wii U it's a it's a new version of Splatoon it's I mean I don't know about that you know like I I understand that that's what they're saying and there's some additive things to it but it's not Splatoon 2, no you know uh and so a 1.24 so we're all right so at 200 right now it's a $1.24 per dollar or per pound for in",

So the suggestion is is that the gaming out the gaming retailers are going to sell the console assuming the pound and the dollar stay at this level of parity for $1.50 profits. Don't know about that. I think people need to temper their expectations. Uh I think the console will cost $300 and maybe it's 300 and 350. I mean these guys have to what the Wii U was right? Exactly. And these guys have to make and I think it's a reasonable price. I don't think it was a reasonable price at all for the Wii U but uh in hindsight I was like I didn't really have a huge problem with it so I'm not going to pretend like I did. $300 seems like a normal price.

I'm a little concerned about this particular this thing seems to be lost unless I'm misunderstanding which is entirely possible. Sorry we had a little malfunction there. What uh I was saying was that I just want people to temper their expectations that the $250 price point makes sense based on the information of the wholesaling price. It doesn't make any sense at all. And so you might want to keep an eye on that. The other thing I was saying is that I don't think I think it's a little weak that Splatoon is the packaging game.

This title will apparently feature 3D open world hub from which different worlds can be selected with multiple objectives to complete just like Mario 64 or Mario Galaxy.

A very ambitious game, maybe even too much, claimed one particular source. That brings us to the month of November. More sources have now come forward and corroborated my information. They've told me that localization for Breath of the Wild might not be finished until the end of December. After localization completed, the game will require between at least four to six months of testing. As I mentioned earlier, this is one of Nintendo's largest and most ambitious games ever.

Furthermore, I hear the final version of the game is a bit harder than what the press and media played at E3.
