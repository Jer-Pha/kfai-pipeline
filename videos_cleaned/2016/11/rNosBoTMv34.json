Greg Miller and Nick Scarpino. Let's start this off right how we how we normally do our Kinda Funny Reacts movie reviews. Yes. What do you think? No spoilers. Spoilerfree. Should people see this movie? Greg this you know that I don't like space. I don't like magic. And I'm a DC guy. Ladies and gentlemen this was a delightful film. Fun top to bottom. Great performances. Yes you should go see this. I had a ball. Uh I would also agree that we should go see this. Oh I'm sorry Nick. What do you think that people should do about this movie? Can I talk now? You can talk now Nick. Okay. Uh I really liked it. I think people should go see it. And this is the first for me. Uh I think people should see it in 3D and I think they should see it in IMAX 3D. Yeah. I think it's it's that kind of film where um it's got a good story but it",

I think it's it's that kind of film where um it's got a good story but it really is a tour de force when it comes to the actual visuals of this. And uh I didn't realize it until I saw the the camera system they use the end which I think was shot on Alexa 65 which is a kind of a native IMAX style format. So um I think it would be worth seeing it again in IMAX if they do IMAX 3D. Um not the least of which because I think this is a movie. This is a movie that you should see on a big screen. Do not wait for this to come to your freaking iPad or your your home. But if it's on the back of a Virgin America seat you got to watch it. You know what I'm saying? You're ready to fly. Long story short I really liked it. I think people should run out and see it. I agree. This movie was awesome. It was way more than anything I could have ever expected from it. Um I think",

And this is an origin story. And I think that this beat out many of the origin stories especially when we start looking at characters that to be honest most people don't care about. So Doctor Strange being one of them Thor Captain America I'd even put in another. Well Thor though like you know I remember going into Thor and being like I do I don't care at all. And walking out of the theater and being like that was good. Yeah it was fun. I liked that. I think it's above that though. You know what I mean? That's the Okay. So what blows me away is Ant-Man.

I put this on the level of the the Guardians in terms of origin tales where it's like this movie was super awesome and introduced us to to characters that people aren't too familiar with. Um and the most important thing this is something that Guardians nailed as well. It had an identity. 100% entirely from the the visuals from the characters from the story uh the the sound design was amazing the um the the fight choreography the action scenes the villains everything. There was an identity to it and it all felt grounded in the world but that world feels like it belongs in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Super awesome for me.

You know what I mean? And uh like talks to Doctor Strange whatever. I Doctor Strange to me always just seemed like some weird magic guy like some adult who knew magic. Never really was fun never was interesting. And like here he has so much depth to him. There's so many different things. And he was funny and he was an **** and he was all these things. I was like \"Oh cool. I like this guy. I'd like to read Doctor Strange comics if it's like this.\" Well so I fall in in kind of a different camp than this where I am by no means an expert in Doctor Strange.

Now granted Ultimate Universe different version of the story. Um but I've also read a lot of 616 Spider-Man comics and other stuff. So Doctor Strange is there and he he in those at least is a bit more fun of a character. I'd say he's more similar to uh like Tony Stark in terms of like he's sarcastic and quippy a bit more than he is in this. Uh but I feel like the Marvel Cinematic Universe had to have this character be different because we already have that Tony Stark. Um we already have an Ant-Man even uh you know like Paul Rudd's Ant-Man is very kind of like funny you know.

Uh it didn't pull punches and it kind of gave us way more than I expected to get out of it. Um and most importantly most it a lot of the the things that happened felt earned. And I feel like there was a lot of character development. And when you look at uh Strange's kind of arc in this movie it's like huh wow there was growth and it makes sense and it didn't go too far. And there wasn't too many moments where I had to suspend my disbelief which is saying a lot when they introduced magic into this whole game. Yeah. I mean I feel the same way.

Casting is great story is great. Um the way it sort of culminates into the climax and and I don't want to we're getting into spoiler territory right here but kind of the way it wraps up I think is very fulfilling and well supported right? These are not things that we've traditionally seen in those kind of one-off uh origin stories. You can you can tell that a lot of care was actually spent on the script crafting a story that they knew. It's I'm not going to go out there and say that it's wholly original right? This is not this is not going to blow you away the way uh The Matrix blew me away the first time I saw it right?

You got Benedict Cumberbatch you've got Rachel McAdams you've got Mads Mikkelsen I can never say his last name. Um was he the bad guy? He was a bad guy. Yeah I remember his name came up for maybe it was when he got cast in this but I remember when his name came up in Colin Greg was like I don't know this guy. So uh he played the I know my my touch note for him is that he played Le Chiffre in uh Casino Royale. He was the bad guy that cried blood. So he was the first really good Bond uh villain we'd seen uh in a while specifically in the Daniel Craig-verse.

It's the standard sort of paint by numbers Marvel film right? But it is so expertly executed here that it makes it actually enjoyable and fun. And I think that to to the the credit of the directors and the producers and and the creative team behind this they gave Benedict Cumberbatch just enough like creative freedom to really own that character right? And really actually make that character that is is kind of just a a combination of a lot of the other Marvel characters. Like he really is kind of Tony Stark in this a little bit if you think about it. like really rich really uh you know uh not ignorant um egotistical kind of guy that thinks he can control the world and then spoilers turns out that he can't.

It is ex it's pretty much that and he has to discover that you know he's got it within himself to whatever. So team now are we are we done with spoiler free discussion? Sure. If you haven't seen this movie you don't want anything spoiled turn it off now. But we all say you should see this movie. Absolutely. So now we're going to spoiler zone. Highway to the spoiler zone. I'm impressed you didn't bump into some beatbox. This is why I love working here.

This movie went beyond that. There was the character there was the all right here's another guy that does the same things this guy does but he learned first. It's it's the generic plot right? But then they're like \"Nope Dormammu's in this. And not only is Dormammu in this they've been talking about him the entire time. So we have a frame of reference for who he is and what he can do.

Or he can't be stopped. There's no way to get him.\" That was for me that is for me the number one sin that normally happens in these films right? is that the resolution is not fulfilling. The way our main character goes about solving whatever the main problem is generally tends to fall flat. This one while I actually did not see this coming I did not know what he was going to do when he went there. It was set up a little bit at the very beginning right in the middle of the you know the second act or whatever when they talk about how bad it is to **** with him like with time and how you know you can get there's no time here.
