So I think I might have been us though, just us being lazy. We're gonna be any closer to the show. But anyway, doesn't matter. Live show coming up happening December 1st, the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. The event will be live streamed in a wide variety of platforms. You can expect where to find them pretty much everywhere. Said to begin at 8:30 PM for the pre-show with the event itself at 9 PM. We can expect to see some world premieres. This is not world premieres, more to be in a way. They'll probably some musical segments of some sort. A panel of judges from 9 international publications selected the nominees for The Game Awards.",

Thanks, Geoff Keighley, for recognizing Kinda Funny as one. I was looking through the list, I'm like, huh, it's cool we made it. Yeah, there's a lot of other people that are like way bigger than us and way more motel. Anybody's Hiva people think we're a bigger deal in ER. So I don't think so. Really cool. Then they also had eight esports focused outlets assist in the selection of winners for those things, which is a good call because we've already been like, oh no, friggin' gift a team Infinity, whoever the hell they are. Um, then games had to be released commercially on or before November 4, 2016 in order to be eligible. So that means no Final Fantasy XV, Dead Rising 4, or The Last Guardian.

So this is necessarily what we want to win, some predictions for what will win. Okay. Do we want to decide what we want to win? We can do that too. Okay, because I think we have to vote on these eventually, right? We nominated them, that's the pool. Oh yeah, and now we actually vote. I won't read it. That's and I don't think it's some kind of secret ballot initiative where we go, I'm not, you know, Geoff hasn't said, hey, you got to go into this booth here and punch the ticket. I guess you're right, we should probably do that now. I'm gonna be okay. Cool. Yeah, so for you guys that are interested, the nomination process was pretty simple.

All three of us had would be ranked one pick, two of us are going to pick, one of us would be next and go from there. There wasn't too much things that were in question. We agreed, I think, on most stuff. There was a couple, couple scenarios where we had maybe seven nominations for some categories, but we figured that stuff out pretty easily. Let's start with the big one, Game of the Year, for a game that delivers the absolute best experience across all creative and technical fields. Doom from id Software and Bethesda Softworks, Inside from Playdead, Overwatch from Blizzard Entertainment, Titanfall 2 from Respawn Entertainment. LoL, come on. And Uncharted 4.

I would vote Uncharted 4 because it's the one I enjoyed the most on there. I would predict, I can easily see Uncharted doing it, but I would predict Inside, really. I think Inside's that kind of that indie darling. I think Inside caught a lot of people off guard. I think in a, you know, it's one of those where I know I didn't, I, I was mad at the ending, right? That's my only complaint with it. When we did that review, it was totally just like, it's awesome and this is great and the way it's time that is amazing and the art style is great. I loved how, do you know what I mean? Like there's something super special about that. And I could see that catching enough judges off guard, if you will, that that would take it, 'cause everyone expects the same problem with every sequel to an amazing thing.

I but I think it was a step up enough that I think that could be a possible thing. Hmm, hmm. That's interesting. I mean, Inside's definitely in my in my top three games of the year. I don't think I voted for number one again. I'm not voting him. Yeah, vote it. But even predict. Yeah, I mean, that's I can see that, that makes sense because a lot of the the publications did love that game. I think my my vote would be Overwatch. I think Overwatch is the is the Game of the Year. By that's a really good point too in terms of those people voting for it. I don't know. I think it's I think it's between Overwatch and Inside, but I think Overwatch gets the nod on that. I don't think Uncharted gets it. So you're predicting Overwatch? Yes.",

So you're predicting Overwatch? Yes. Colin, I think Overwatch will win. I think that Inside is the best Game of the Year out of that list. So I would personally vote Inside, but I would I would assume that Overwatch will win. Yeah. Okay. I mean, this I'm sure we'll have many Game of the Year conversations later towards the end of the year, but for me, Overwatch is the the Game of the Year overall. Like when you really think about it, like 2016, that game is the gift that keeps on giving. And it, well, Uncharted 4, great. Overwatch is something new. Even if that's something new is just, oh, it's another shooting game. Sure. But it's not just another shooting game. Like the cast of characters, the fan base, and the the gameplay of it, it's that's going to be any people are playing for years to come. Doesn't say the community, I think, is a huge part of that.",

And it was designed around having having that, having community, having cosplayers, and having like a story to it, like a world that is ever evolving. And for a multiplayer only game, I think that it's really successful in having a story. Mm-hmm. So I'd give it to Overwatch. But yeah, I mean, all these games are great. Um, what else we go out there? I put voting, but we don't have to decide about it for all split already. Oh, we can keep talking. Yeah, we can keep talking. Let's just do predictions. Yes, let's do predictions. So right now then for Game of the Year, Game Awards, I predict Inside. You both Inside. You both predict Overwatch. Yes. And I think that's a pretty safe pick at all.

Best Game Direction, recognizing a game studio for outstanding creative vision, game direction and design. Incredibly redundant category, by the way, since it's the same five studios that made these five games. Isn't Blizzard Entertainment for Overwatch, EA DICE for Battlefield 1. Okay, so that's different. id Software for Doom, Naughty Dog for Uncharted 4, Respawn Entertainment for Titanfall 2. So who's who's missing always? I didn't put blatantly. What was our definition of Game Direction? Recognizing a game studio for outstanding creative vision, game direction and design. See, it's hard again. I'd give this to Overwatch for everything I just said. It's hard though, because with I think that Uncharted and Naughty Dog, it's they're so amazing that it's kind of easy to look at them as the Waldo. Those are good, you know.

Yeah, in the same way that I'd say that about things like Battlefield or Titanfall where it's just like we expect it from it. So it's less I think impressive. My thing is I think Uncharted wins this one and I think the voting populace, the answer is because they don't give a Game of the Year. Yeah, but they can give it this over. They tied together the whole series. They tied together how great it was. They played on your emotions from what happened in 1-3 and a little bit of Golden Abyss. They tied up so nicely. What an amazing ending. I think that's the way they get in. Obviously the game plays, the game played Uncharted is amazing. Yeah, yeah, it's hmm. Uncharted has the most nominations by far out of any other game. Yeah, but it's really gonna haven't cleaned up when you get lower into the thing, right? We talk about performances. Yes.

I mean, I think Playdead, I'm really surprised by that specifically because I think Inside is leaps and bounds in design ahead of everything I played this year. And that's not an insult on them, other great design games I played this year. But I was so astonished by how good Inside was that um, you know, it resonated me with a lot more than another Uncharted game. And I'm not insulting them at all, but I didn't see anything in Uncharted 4 really where on a personal level where I'm like, this is leaps and bounds ahead of what they did with the trilogy. I don't think that there's anything there that that's the case. But I do think that it will win. And that's again, this is the",

It would be between Blizzard and Naughty Dog. For me, clearly Blizzard has the special sauce with whatever they're doing. Mm-hmm. Right, yeah. You you are Blizz Overwatch, were Uncharted. Yes. I know. Surprise, surprise. Best Narrative for outstanding storytelling, a narrative development in a game. Firewatch from Campo Santo, Inside from Playdead, Mafia III from Hangar 13 / 2K Games, Oxenfree from Night School Studio, and Uncharted 4 from Naughty Dog. I would say Inside tells an amazing story with no words, no text, and it leaves it open to interpretation, which I think is really cool too. I think it should win. I think it will win.

Okay, this one's tough because you got to be a betting man here. Hmm. Well, that's a prediction to work. You don't put your money on the line here. And so I think I want to go against my own personal beliefs and I think Oxenfree has a shot here because I think again, it's a game people are going to want to reward, but maybe not a mean. Obviously, I think I'm not so far in the other categories, but here it pops up and it is this story that it's a game that, you know, for I thought missed on certain levels. You want to replay again. You want to go back and make the other choices. You want to see how all of the threads come together in different ways and see the different endings and what happens if they end up together and what happens if they don't.

You know that this is a gimme. This is gonna the second's gonna confuse people. I'm just throwing that out there right now. Well, I feel like we're saying both of our answers as we go, right? Yeah, I guess just that um, yeah. Okay, Tim, what's your prediction? I loved Firewatch. I loved its story, but it's not the best. Um, between Inside and Uncharted, for me, Uncharted, I'd say is my favorite of it, but I'm gonna give it to Inside. Oh God, I think it's deserved as well. That's you to vote for as well.

Best Art Direction for outstanding creative and technical achievement in artistic design and animation. Abz\u00fb from Giant Squid and 505 Games, Firewatch from Campo Santo, Inside from Playdead, Overwatch from Blizzard, and Uncharted 4 from Naughty Dog. This one for me is really hard because I wouldn't give it to Uncharted 4. Wouldn't give it to Abz\u00fb. Firewatch was one of those ones where it's like, if you were to tell me or like late last year that I wouldn't be voting for Firewatch for Best Art Direction this year, I'd say you're crazy.

I think it's another situation of your some people going to be voting so much for Inside in other categories, they'd get here and go Firewatch, right? One. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. I think it's between Inside and Uncharted. So we talked about Art Direction and and all that is why. I mean, Uncharted is a masterpiece in terms of the way it looks. Um, but I would I think Inside is clearly the winner in that respect. I mean, it's just so unique, so interesting.

I think that a piggy back half what you said, the fact that animation is mentioned in this, I think is going to boost Inside a lot because the animation that game is so next level. Don't get me wrong. Again, I'm predicting Firewatch. My pick, if I was voting, would be Inside. Cool. And your what are you already predicting? Come on, Inside. You're praising and that's where you come down personally anyway. Yes, both. That's a unanimous win then in terms of our votes for Art Direction. Cool. Best Music / Sound Design.

Battlefield 1 from DICE, Doom from id, Inside from Playdead, Rez Infinite from Enhance Games with Thumper from Drool. Mmm, Thumper was the one that I left off and I forgot about when we did our nominations. I would have definitely put that in there. Whoo, man, it's hard. Inside was was very well sound design, but I don't give it to it here. I feel like Rez here. I feel like Rez and Thumper are the games out that the shout sound to me.

And people are gonna think Firewatch because when you think Art Design, you don't think Uncharted, you think Firewatch. When you think Sound Design, you think Rez. My my thing is Thumper would win if more people played it. I don't know if enough people played it to get it. Doom is also I think an easy and easy answer. True. 'Cause it does have that sound aesthetic to it. Right, right. ****, I was a Thumper. Probably heard that's your prediction. Yeah, I'm gonna go Rez. Tim, Thumper's my vote.

I can see people voting for the Firewatch people because the other the Uncharted guys and Lady have gotten talked about for insurers. But I'm trying to think back if Nolan North's ever won a performance game award before. Not that this is like the Oscars where there's like somebody doing detailed stats on this or whatever. Like he's there's a Leonardo DiCaprio. How are you weighing down on this one? I think Drake wins. Nolan North, I think you should and I think you will. That's kind of where I stand. Tim. Hmm.
