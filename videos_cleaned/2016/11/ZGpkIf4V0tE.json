Yeah, the details apparently, um, Harry Knowles from uh, Ain't It Cool News, yeah, and Eli Roth from uh, everything, everything, apparently discovered this tape of these kid, these these kids, now adults, who over the span of basically their entire life have been shooting a shot-for-shot remake of Raiders of the Lost Ark. ****. Yes. Now it sounds completely absurd because it is. And when you watch it, they did things like, um, light themselves on fire with gasoline and almost burn the house down, um, a couple times actually, 'cause I had to reshoot that scene because they were kids and they left the letter on the camera.

Um, so I just think that's fascinating. It got me thinking, I'm like, it reminded me of the other uh, shot-for-shot remakes that the internet have done. Obviously, there's a m-famously, my RoboCop Remake, which has some of the funniest ****. Everyone go do it. Do it.

I'm like, I got to show you this video. I forgot about this video. It was so disturbing. Like I remember, I remember you identifying Master Rapist. It's one, it, that was a good day. That was a good day. So why, I mean, my first question about the Raiders, why didn't they do the superior film, Temple of Doom? Was my, my first, my first question.

There's a certain spirit that goes along with this that at first you're like, this is, this is stupid 'cause you're not going to make uh, any money off of this. And then of course, it got picked up by like Harry Knowles and and Eli Roth and the founder of Alamo Drafthouse. I guess they did, I might get these details wrong, but I guess they did a uh, a a movie marathon, like a film festival marathon where you would sit there for like 4 hours and watch films and eat and have fun. And the guy was like, Eli Roth's like, you got to, you got to see this. This is hilarious. Like this is awesome. It's these kids and you literally see them growing up, but they shot it out of order.

Um, it's pretty crazy. So I mean that, I just, so you go from sort of looking at this film and thinking that's an absurd concept because you can't make any money off that, at least that's how I thought about it too. Wow.
