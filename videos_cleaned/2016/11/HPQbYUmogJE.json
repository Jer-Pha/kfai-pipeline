This shirt is making him look like an Adonis. Not right now because now he looks like he's all small and slouchy, but like, why, why Kevin, why right here? Look at the definition he's getting in here. He's getting that come back up a sec, come back up just a sec, then you can go back down. Look at the definition he's getting in here. This belly, he's looking real good, real good. I like the colors of the shirt. It's Gamescast colors. It's a severed shirt. Yeah, looking good game. Thank you. It is a great game.

It's all I want to do. Tim, so you're playing yesterday, I saw and I was, I was asking you how the single player going and you're saying you're just doing who the **** knows how the single player's going. I run around doing all the side stuff. I'm just collecting non-stop because it's just one of those things that I'm doing so well at getting the research points and unlocking the new things on my trees. Why even bother playing the game until I've done all of that? Until I've gotten every paint job, until I've gotten every piece of clothing, until I've gotten every research point. Why?

And I'm like, I appreciate this to an extent, but I don't appreciate the fact that I've come back multiple times to these locations and they're timed.

And then I'll actually do some of these goddamn story missions. Get in there, see what DedSec's up to. Cause the ones when I do stumble in one, when I want to shake it up, as they say, and I go in there and do a little bit, cause you know, they have, they have a nice little progression bar. You of when you're going to your little DedSec app, you can see every mission you have available to you, how far you've gone in them, because they're like narrative based or whatever, which I really like.

I went to Alcatraz yesterday. Get to Alcatraz. I've never been to Alcatraz. That's what really, yeah, I guess that's one of the weird things about living in a city with the tourist attraction, right?

I get there for some reason, the gangs had like, there was a gang set up on Alcatraz that was protecting a, a bag of money. I knocked all these **** out and got their money and got out of there. But then I was just going, I was like, oh, there's Marin. Why not go over there? Ended up in Oakland at one point. I'm just bumming around and just seeing what's happened in the Bay Area. I don't know why you'd ever want to go to Marin. Well, cause there's, there's collectibles there. There's research points there. You know what I mean?

I know it's there. I see it sometimes when I drive by it, but it's really curvy. Here I am now taking photos, jumping cars, doing crazy **** with it. I got my nitrous. I'm nitrousin' all over the **** city. Doing, having a great time. I like that. I appreciate that. Seems like a lot of people like the game.

I think more in terms of that the game's perception where that game needed everything it, it could get to succeed.

Like them getting, I forgot what I got from IGN, but it was some like a 6.5, five was in progress review. I don't know if they've updated it. A 65 in progress review is not good. You know, for a game that needed an eight to be relevant to, to those people. Obviously, the people that want are going to play it anyways. For the game to like chart well, I don't know.

Uh, no, yeah, there's, there are other things to play, especially like, you know, Dead Rising's on the horizon. I'm looking forward to that still too. I'll play your Final Fantasy, Last Guardian. But I right now, I have a time to focus on this. I want to try Dishonored. Everybody seems like Dishonored is great. I mean, I granted Dishonored 1 wasn't for me, but I want to do Dishonored 2. Mhm. Mhm. I've been playing a little game called Pokemon Moon. Did you catch them all? Didn't catch them all. Caught a lot more than I would have ever expected myself to. Uh, played the game. Say right.

Uh, it was one that I wanted to get done quickly because I, I know that at any moment we're going to get Final Fantasy. And I'm just like, I got to be ready for that.

I've been out of that for so long. Like, and everybody, a lot of people talk a lot of **** about me because I'm like a Gen 1 when it comes to it. And it's like, I love Red, Blue, Gold, Silver are my favorites. Ruby and Sapphire, great. Diamond, Pearl, pretty good. Black and White, I kind of fell out of. Black and White 2 were great. But it's like, they none of them have the, the meanings that, uh, Red, Blue, Gold, and Silver did for me. So I am that type of fan. But I played the, the rest of them, X and Y included.

I just enjoy playing through the game, maybe playing with my friends once, like a little bit and call it a day. So for this to be coming out, I was like, I don't know that I need another Pokemon right now. Like, X and Y years ago at this point. Uh, I played and I thought that that was the right time for me to get back into Pokemon. And it was, it was a great time. And then they announced the, uh, Ruby and Sapphire remakes. And I was like, oh, that's cool. I liked the Hoenn region back in the day. But like, wasn't motivated to play them again.

We still called it an NX. Never forget. Exactly. And for me, I'm like, all right, cool. There's all this news about Nintendo kind of having a fresh restart and going forward on that. So it felt like a weird back step for them to have another full generation of Pokemon on the 3DS. But then now that we kind of know everything, I think it makes a little more sense. Uh, because it's the 3DS. Nintendo needed something this holiday. And they had the NES Classic. But obviously, they really misplanned that.

And Sun and Moon is kind of the culmination of a lot of this type of fans' problems with the game. Uh, things like HMs taking up move spots for, for Pokemon and just kind of getting in the way and requiring you to, to have Pokemon that are just there in your party for HMs and nothing else. They got rid of that because now there's this Pokemon Ride feature where you essentially have this pager and you can just, uh, call a Charizard. It's not your Charizard, but it's like Uber.

You can like run around and look for other items. So you don't need to use the Poke scul. Is surge pricing for these guys? Uh, there's no surge pricing. It's unlimited use. You, it's, and you get them pretty early on too, which is, which is great because it, it just feels like this game respects the fact that they know that most people playing it have played Pokemon before. Cut the **** and get you right into it. It's cutting a lot of the **** and it, it really kind of, there's a lot of features that keep things fresh but familiar. Yeah. Um, sometimes too familiar.

And story-wise, they did some things that I thought were, uh, really fresh. And there's no gyms in the game. And a lot of this stuff has been out there for a long time, but I haven't been reading about it. Like, I'm calling a Greg. Live will like top level look at a headline and make fun of stupid designs or whatever. But all the tropical guys, all they didn't, they do a lot of tropical guys this one. Yes, like forms. Exactly. Here's a Charizard and a pineapple and they **** and now we got this thing. Exactly.

Everybody wants to catch the Pikachu and whatever. So then the generations that are just all new ones, like Ruby and Sapphire were, or like, um, X and Y were, or Black and White were, rather. You go in and there's just a whole bunch of new Pokemon that there's a bunch of grumpy people like, great, it's another bird that's not a Pidgey. It's another rat that's not a Rattata.

So the Alola forms, uh, it's, you're still getting Vulpix, but now it's ice type instead of fire or whatever. So it's like those type of things are nice. But in addition to that, the game even from early on switches up what you'd expect. So everybody that's played Pokemon knows that you get the Pidgeys and Rattatas early on. In this game, you can catch ghost types. You can catch water types, fire types in the second area of the game. And I'm like, holy ****, they're really opening this up to be a different type of experience. Um, while still giving us the, the old, a nice mix of new and old.

Uh, then the, the biggest change is that there's no gyms. And instead of gyms, there's a thing called the, the Island Trial Challenge or whatever. So that there's four different islands in the game with a couple little like side islands that don't count as full ones. And instead of it being eight badges you go out and get and then go to the Elite Four and all that. In this game, each island has a what's called a Kahuna. So they're like kind of the leader of the, the island. The, the big, this all be do a Big Kahuna or they all is, they're all the Big Kahuna.
