So next topic of the day, 2016 in Shooters. It's a good year for Shooters. It feels like it has been. It's a great year. We got Overwatch, we got Titanfall, we got Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, we got Battlefield 1. All of these games. Big Daddy Doom. You're going to get yelled. We got Doom. We got, uh, what else am I missing? I want to hear his thoughts and it doesn't have to be right now on Siege, because Siege has come on so strong this year. So Siege came out last year.

It came out and everybody's like, oh, that's not doing anything. And then this year it's just been, it's just the thing with Siege is it came, it, it was victim in the same way that like Titanfall seems to be a victim this year, and it just came out the wrong time, totally, where there's so much other **** going on last year, where had it been earlier in the year, I think it would have like been more popular, because you don't really see people talking about Siege now, but the people that are into it seem to be super **** into. Yeah, but Siege have always had that hardcore fan base. And I think one of the things, as you know, to go alongside with the fact that he released, you know, during the time of Call of Duty and everything like that, was the fact that it just had a lot of issues, you know what I mean?

You can start there. I think, I think it applies for the year of Shooters in 2016. I, I feel like it's un, like it's weird, because like Siege came out last year, but in terms of like best Shooters 2016, I honestly feel like Siege is in there, because they've just done so many right things with that game and it shows, right? Like the, the, the first two ESL tournaments that they have, um, the third one is, you know, in terms of viewerships, more than the first two combined. Not to mention it's had its higher player base in the past, uh, what, like two months ago.

And they did a really good job of revamping that series, like, and not just going completely in a different direction. And it stays true to like what Siege was back in the day, but evolved beautifully with the whole like how it, you know, you have destructible like walls and objects. And it's just, they did a great job and they, they kept adding to the game in the sense of, uh, operatives, right? They kept adding like new characters that brought something to the table. But like one of the things that I didn't like, I don't like when it comes to like shooters, is I like the competitiveness of shooters.",

And you take away the competitiveness if you start adding too many abilities, right? And you have all these Ops with all these different abilities, but at the basis, it's just gun versus gun skill like fights, which is great. But what I love about the most is that something when it comes to like League, like I can't really get into League, but I've always respected and appreciated the whole, they have different characters that do different things. And you have like your picking band phase and count like characters that counter each other. And it was cool seeing that come to the shooter genre, right? Um, in terms of the fact that like if I choose this character, um, this other character is going to counter me, but at the end of the day, it just takes one bullet to kill the other opposing player with a head",

So they just, they just kept adding to it and it works. And they keep, they just keep piling into it. And then there's the whole another, uh, season, which they'll probably have another season pass for that too. And it's great. They just, yeah, and they're doing it free DLC, right? That was one of the things they were talking about today. And their thing is how Ubisoft like going forward doesn't want to charge for DLC that's crucial to the game or critical to the game in terms of changing the experience. And that's, and have it more cosmetic and stuff. And there's just a bunch of like little things like they have a ranking system that's kind of like, like, uh, which a lot of games have adopted, which is kind of like League of Legends, where you're like, you play 10 matches, right? And then you place and then",

And they even, they even do little things like, uh, you know, like last season I placed in Platinum, so that means that I got a little Platinum keychain that goes on my gun. Like it's something that's tangible, right? That everyone can see like, oh, this guy is a Platinum player as opposed to like this guy's a gold or anything like that. So it's just little things they done well. Yeah. Is there a punk ass **** medal? Yeah, bronze. Oh, that would be me. Yeah, true. It's like the embarrassment one. Turn. Oh my God.

And you mentioned League, so it's like similar to that. But do you think that the, do you find too many people using the same charact, I'm not too familiar with Rainbow Six, I don't know how this works, but the classes, like, is it like Street Fighter where you go on, there's like a million Kens? Uh, I mean, do have like the must picks, but it's a type of thing where like, even like with any game, right? Like there's tweaks and balances. So they'll take a look and see like, oh, this operative or this character in any video game isn't used very well. We're, well, they even do that with Overwatch, right? They're like, right now they're, they're tweaking Symmetra and I think in the public test servers, because she like no one picks Symmetra, right? And they do the same",

But it, it creates an interesting dynamic as opposed to like Halo, where you just go in and you just play as opposed to like, oh snap, okay, like do we want to change things up and take, um, Rook, where now we all get armor and it takes more bullets to penetrate, you know what I mean? Or as opposed to like, oh, if we don't take this character, then we're take, like, we get this other cool character that can see gadgets through walls, but we risk not taking, not being able to take down their reinforced walls. And so it adds this cool little dynamic in terms of like play styles. So I **** love Overwatch. Overwatch speaks to me because it's that, but as dumb down as possible. If you want, you can, you know, get super into it and play hardcore, but like, it's just fun to play as the different characters",

How do you compare the two? I, I mean, Overwatch is Blizzard. Like Blizzard just does things right, you know what I mean? Like they, they came out with Overwatch. They're, they're memorable characters. It's got like this, this, this mobile type feel to it, right? Or you, or even, even in like, I like how they, they kind of like implemented this mobile feel and even baby step you like into it where just like, oh, you pick all your characters, like, oh, not enough defense characters or not enough healers or not enough attack. And I think Overwatch do a great job of being like fun to play with iconic characters, but like hard to master. Like that game, I, I play a lot of it, but I'm not very good.

And it's just like, wow, I like that I can go in there and play and, and, and do well. But then at the same time, like there's just so much to learn. Um, and I like, I just, I like what games are doing right now where like, they're, they're adding more content, right? And having events, having events and, and having, uh, more things to like with like, uh, Overwatch specifically, how now there's a, a 1v1, you know what I mean? I'm not paying for that, but now there's a new map with a 1v1. There's events. I remember like, it's one of those things where I can come back to the games now, you know, there's a reason for me to come back as opposed to usually I would just play something like Overwatch. I'm like, all right, cool. But now, now, oh, there was a Halloween event with a Halloween themed game mode and they really went like full on through with it now.",

There weren't making a out of things, no content. Exactly. So you leave and you don't come back to it. Or if you do, you're like, oh, where did all this come from? That's great. But they didn't make a thing of it. And that's what we keep talking about, you know, so often on these shows is games becoming platforms. And Overwatch, right, is a platform. Siege is a platform. The Division is a platform. These are shooters that are putting more and more things in there, trying to get you motivated to stick around and be what Destiny has done so well, right?

Yeah, it's very interesting to see how like different games in terms of level of success with that, right? So you got Overwatch and Siege, you've done well as, you know, as time has progressed. And then you get like games like Destiny, who just keep hanging on there. And then you get games like The Division, which I feel were just too ambitious, because I saw The Division, I was like, oh my God, Destiny was my jam. Here's another like loot shooter. They've got this great content plan lined up like with multiple expansions and DLCs. And every time they dropped a new content, it was just glitched.

But that game's in a good, it's interesting because not only can that sometimes backfire on people, but I, they could also bring it back, right? That gives them opportunity because they, they, they dropped the 1.4 patch, which fixes the game. And now they have their new survival DLC, which change, like, adds something, uh, like a lot more depth to, you know what I mean? You guys are familiar with H1Z1? Yeah, yeah. They essentially have that game mode now in The Division, which has got last man standing kind of thing. Yeah, last man standing.

And I have The Last Guardian on the horizon. And Final Fantasy's coming. And there's this. And I need to finish Advanced Warfare or, uh, Infinite Warfare still. Like, there's so much going on that it's so hard that, you know, The Division, I was so into for that first whatever month, three weeks or whatever it was, where I was playing every night. I was so happy to hit that. I was so happy to keep going. But as soon as I hit level cap and then it was like, all right, now it's the gear treadmill.

Ty's like, oh, I've been running this same mission for like six hours to do. And I'm like, whoa, no, no, no, I don't want to do that again. And you think they'd learn because like when Destiny Vanilla was first out, it was, it was too much of a grind. Yeah. So I was sitting here thinking, okay, like The Division seems like it's very closely following that type of like model with like Destiny. And I hope they, they get it. And it was just, yeah, that's the same thing that turned a lot of people off to Destiny, right? It was too much of a grind. It wasn't rewarding enough, right?

Uh, The Division, like I said, the patches fix that. There's new content. Everyone's liking it so far. It's, it's very interesting because before you'd have a game, you'd either like it or not.

K, it's just, it's just one of those things where I was just, it was a clearcut like, I was just so hyped and invested, cuz I mean, you have Blizzard and then they come out and they create all these like iconic characters.

But my God, hold on, going to Modern Warfare Remastered. Did they mess that up on PC? It was just a mess. Uh, seems like that happens in a lot of PC games. Yeah, that was on us too. Okay, okay. How you guys enjoying Watch Dogs on PC? You know, it's just Master Race. All right, we got the Hz, we got the customization. Oh yeah, the teraflops and your **** video drivers. Great times. Um, but yeah, no, just, just jumping over to Modern Warfare Remastered. I remember like, I gra, I got a key off Steam and then I couldn't play with my friend who owned it on Windows, like on the Windows like game store. They split that base up. What?

I don't, I don't even know. But, um, I think in going, going into like the shooters, I think it's a great time for shooters right now. I love that you, oh man, Call of Duty multiplayer is just in a weird state right now. I just, just don't feel like, I feel like their identity is kind of lost, you know? I saw the multiplayer and I was like, what am I, am I watching like an arena shooter right now? I'm not quite sure what's happening. I like the single player. I thought single player was great. I was happy that even though a lot of people were upset that Call of Duty went into space, I mean, you had Remastered, right? So if you want that old school, um, Battlefield is awesome.
