But do you think you could watch those trailers in the Final Fantasy XV Omen trailer before the show? See if you get whatever here. I've seen the Stars. I mean, what do you, what do you guys think? I'm trying to think. That's the problem. Yeah, that trailers have gotten to such a point, right, where they're usually great. Like, what I mean, like when I think of like, when you say best video game trailers, right? I'm like, I'm like Mad World, Gears of War. Yeah, I mean, like, I'm not, I don't, I'm like trying to think of like, oh, what, what has been great this year? And you know what I mean? Like, what has stood out above the rest?

Oh yeah. And when it comes to E3 or PSX, or any of these conventions where they people announce the games, like the trailer is the most important part of share because that's how you announce the game. And I feel like we've went through kind of phases in eras when it comes to video game trailers. Like back in the day, it was just a video game trailer was random cuts of gameplay without music underneath it. And it was just, here, here's parts of the game. Yep, period. Then it kind of transitioned into more like, all right, we're going to kind of eight movie trailers. But it was movie trailers at the time. So we're getting the in a world where blah, blah.

And you see these video game like, it was a really text-based. Then we kind of moved into the era where it was just CG cutscenes. And I was it. And you're not getting any gameplay at all. Yeah. Um, and it was just like simulated gameplay or whatever. Then we got to the point where we're getting a lot of it, uh, licensed music in trailers. And that's when we start getting the Gears of War, Mad World, since Chris Dodd, these Assassin's Creed Revelations. In that whole era was just like the Sanskrit pirate one that Drake music / SI. Then we come to the dumpster. Everything was those dubs appears. But there's like clear things where everybody just does the same thing over and over. And then, then we hit a point where like live-action trailers in the Halo 3 days, we're like really taken off. Metroid: Other M had an amazing one. And it was just like, here's a",

Yeah, all the Star Wars RPGs, MMOs. Those trailers are amazing. The Force Unleashed trailers were amazing. And now at a point where it's like, if you show that stuff, you lose. You know, like having a full CG, as beautiful as it is, shout out to Dishonored 2. That CG trailer is **** awesome. But people want to see the gameplay. And they're like, I don't want this. We're at a point where the gameplay can and should speak for itself. So it's like the art of the trailer these days is really tricky because I feel like it's almost impossible to please anyone. Yeah, you know, no, you're 100% correct with that. The one I was, you know, digging around online, I remember that",

The one I was, you know, digging around online, I remember that E3 trailer for We Happy Few. That was really good. But again, they showed some of the game and then gave me the trailer exact. And it's the same thing. Whereas like, does this Spider-Man reveal teaser act as a trailer? Because there's CG in that. And then there's that little segment that looks like gameplay, but isn't. Who I wasn't only, I'd count that as a trailer. But even that isn't like, it wasn't like, holy ****, what a trailer. I was like, holy ****, what an announcement. ****, I can't wait. Asking. And that's true. That's true. Think that when you think all time, maybe not best trailers, but influential trailers like Dead Island. Oh yeah. Oh my God, is Dead Island.

Yes, that was a new IP from developer and publisher at the time that nobody was like, I wouldn't care about these people. Who are they? You know, any what does this mean? And then they put out the trailer. It was just **** phenomenal. Yeah. So it's like, to have that type of like, oh ****, from a trailer is, that's a huge accomplishment these days. And I think that when it comes to, there's the flip side of that. We're like Death Stranding comes to mind. Well, it's just like, yeah, there was an announcement. There was also a trailer, which gave us enough to speculate and be able to talk about and have a discussion about what could this be. Sure.

You know, but it's fluff that we can kind of Norman Reedus's invisible baby, an umbilical cord, dog, sick, Psycho Mantis is, or whatever in the sky. Um, it again, like Kojima's master trailers, he always has been. Like thinking of Metal Gear Solid, any, any Metal Gear Solid trailer really. Yeah. But the, the trailers leading into for 15 minute long trailers were **** great. And in five, every single Metal Gear Solid V trailer made you go, this is a real video game. Yeah, like that's insane. Yeah. Uh, but I think this E3 had a lot of things like that Spider-Man moment that were kind of like, oh, this is, this is cool. But it's more of the announcement.

I think Detroit: Become Human was the one that did the most for me in the sense of, I didn't give a **** about this, now I do. What was the, it was the one with the guy, it was all cut from the demo of them on the rooftop. Yeah. I'm showing different ways that writings could play out with, with the sea. Like when I think in Detroit, I think about the one where first off, obviously the Kara short film or whatever. But then the one even where it is her just walking and she like turns around and all the other AIs are noticing as she goes. And then she's like, my name is Kara or whatever. And the evolved over.

And as it was happening, it wasn't a great trailer because like people kind of didn't care. Yeah. I feel like towards the end of it, everyone's like, what, what is this? You know? And that's another good thing for if you're gonna, even if it is a cheap, it's an announcement. So you got that like cheap pop there. It was **** Resident Evil 7. And no one saw that coming until the title came up. And that is crazy. I mean, similarly, against overlooked all the time.

I thought that was a really interesting note for that because it did leave us with a lot of questions. But then when you saw the game playing, like I was obvious, yeah, that it didn't mesh with what they had built. I thought something I'm kind of torn on was, I remember like back during the day when the announcements were really during the press conferences, you're like, oh my goodness, what is this? And the trailer would pop up and maybe get gameplay on top of that. But how do you guys feel like now with sometimes you'll kind of get the teaser or like the game will be announced like a week or two before E3, but then you most likely get the game demo during E3?

It's like, yeah, it's like at E3, how, why would people care about talking about, I'm trying to give an example, but Gears of War 4. Why don't thinking about that when the post Kojima came out and talked about Death Stranding? You know what I mean? It's just that Gears of War, it's the fourth game. Cool. You know, we get it. So it's like them time about that early, it's almost like a, hey, we don't to be included in the 15 coolest things from Sony's press conference. We want you just to put up this trailer. 'Cause then, 'cause at the press conference when they do the demo, like you're talking about, right, then it speaks to the audience that cares about that. Like that God of War demo was awesome. Oh,",

Um, but the, the trailers that stand out to me this year, you be nailed it there. The Final Fantasy XV Omen trailer. That was a trailer. It's fully CG. So it is totally just cheating. And it's like a trailer representative of a bygone era. But so it's Final Fantasy XV at this point. But I saw that trailer and I'm like, I need to show Kevin this. This is going to make Kevin want to play this game. This is **** awesome. And I think that that, that is the high five, guys. You did it. And the other trailers this year that did that for me were Battlefield 1. The, there's a trailer that the single player can. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw that and I'm annoyed play the game. Easy.

Then you played it and it still looks amazing. I got the Rainbow Six Siege reveal, which wasn't really a demo as more just like a video. And they made Siege look absolutely great. And then the game came out, didn't look nothing. No, no. But I mean, I was the other thing like back in the day, Killzone. Seeing trailers for that. And it's just like that time I was like CG representing gameplay. And it's like, I'm happy we're not there. Shenmue. Yeah. Um, but yeah, so the Final Fantasy XV trailer was great.

And that they're still coming out and they're still awesome. They just said what BlizzCon? They had Sombra. Like her announcement was with one of those little like CG like stories. And it was awesome. Oh yeah, Sombra was great. The trailer of E3 for me though, South Park: The Fractured But Whole. So good. That trailer to me represents the best of what South Park has to offer, which is super quick, smart humor that's commentary on something happening. And that commentary happens to be about superhero movies. Yeah. And it was just like, so they nailed the, the niche that they're going for.

I, you just the desert. And you just record timing. Halo 3. Yeah. Then I was a fight. That was two. Was the 'I Need a Weapon.' Yes. And that was cool because that was in theaters.

Yeah. So **** good. And then, then Halo 3. Look later, the later trailers were great for it too. When they did that whole, the diorama one. And yeah, also that Memorial, I think it was called. That was breaking my heart because I remember seeing that. And then you just used to Chief being such a badass. And then you see, um, it wasn't the Brutes.

I think, I mean, you're talking about, you hit on it, right? Whenever Blur did something. And this is back in the day now when I go as well.

And silly, I'm not doing wrong. Not everybody stuck around. But enough people did that. Remember when that game came out? They were like, we didn't put enough copy. Sorry, everybody working on it. Yeah, we're all over it. So funny. Other note to have Left 4 Dead. I remember the Left 4 Dead one trailer. I don't remember, uh, it, it's just, it was just a trailer for the game.
