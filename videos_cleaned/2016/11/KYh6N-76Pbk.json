It's low undershirt, usually under there. You're giving me a lot of skin. That's good. Kevin, give him the one shot. They're giving that skin. Give him the skin in the one shot there. There it is. Look at that. Tim, Kinda Funny Gamescast, everyday, YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames. You have to rub like that. That's not sexy. That's like you have like, that's like you have snot on you. Will say, \"Oh no, stop it! Stop doing that face!\" Definitely don't do that. That's not, that's definitely not what you wanted. It is. How are you doing, Colin? I'm fine, thank you. Good. I'm good.

So what is this My Name is Mayo business? This is an easy way to make money from trophy whores like myself, or people who care at all by trophies, just want simple trophies. $0.99 cross-buy. You get this game, two different trophy lists, and then you tap X or you tap a touchpad on PlayStation 4. Do you have any anything to do with this game? No, I don't believe it or not. I actually struggle because it apparently get its platinum in 45 minutes. You get it on both platforms. I don't think I'm gonna play it on principle because you're not a trophy whore anymore.

I never came back from the bender. I've gone for the easy platinum is doing this stuff. I know, but you made a big deal one day. We're like, \"I'm not gonna do that anymore.\" No, a platinum sprout on. Thank you. Yes, I thank you. So I played a lot of Titanfall 2. Beat it on Master difficulty. Was not talking about My Name is Mayo. So you put it into bikinis sometimes, whipped cream bikini, where you put the Mayo in the bikini. Yes, you put it in a banana suit at one point, and then just tap, tap, tap, tapping it non-stop. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. It's just a jar Mayo, Tim. You put a cause for that.

Okay, so, so Colin, Titanfall. Titanfall. I beat it on Master difficulty. You got all the collectible. And you agree with Greg Miller, right? Yeah, I think that, uh, the, I think it's fine. It's a good game, a very good game. I just think that it's the people saying that this is like an amazing tour de force for somebody. I don't think so. But I'm glad that if people like it. I also can't speak to the multiplayer component, but I played one multiplayer match, Pilots Versus Pilots. So I don't have a lot of perspective on that.

So I think I'm just gonna kind of let that one go. But it was, I'm glad I played it. I enjoyed playing it. I just think the, I think the gunplay is good. I think being in Titans a drag, which I know is weird because of the, the whole thing is about that, or at least that's the hallmark of the game. I think that the pilot combat is great. I think it's fluid. I think it feels good. I think I never wanted to be in a Titan. Every time I got a Titan, I was bummed that I was in it. So perhaps it's just not the game for me. And as I've started Call of Duty, and I played that for, you know, three hours or so, it's just a far superior game. So at least in my perspective. So in, I'm well for a multitude of reasons,",

So in, I'm well for a multitude of reasons, actually. But so I really think that Titanfall, as far as the three shooters are concerned, of having beaten both two of them on a halt, on the hardest difficulty, then playing the one of them on Veteran, which is the third, the hardest difficulty. There's two difficulty levels that aren't even on the lock to the beginning. I don't know what they are, but you get that YOLO Mode, aren't you? Yeah, the YOLO Mode's one, which is Sam's called YOLO Mode. Yeah, you only live once. So I feel like that the trend has Call of Duty trending far ahead of Titanfall. If you want to talk about coffee coming out breakfast, say about that. Second top of second topic. Oh, so yeah, yeah. So I think that, you know, good time for sure. If you like shooters, your multiple shooters, I'm sure I can really speak to that again. But the",

If you like shooters, your multiple shooters, I'm sure I can really speak to that again. But the single, from the single-player campaign perspective, I think Titanfall is the least, you know, interesting. And then I think Battlefield 1 obviously is there. And I think Call of Duty is, someone said it, so I don't want, it's not a unique thought necessarily. I don't know where I write it, but it's, it's doesn't even really feel like Call of Duty. Why is it so interesting? Mm-hmm. You also played a bit of that NES Classic over the, the Extra Life. Yeah, quite a bit of it. Uh, it's great. Controller's cord is very, and it's an issue that's actually like absurd. Like I don't even know what they're, I don't even know they were thinking with it. Why not even just make it wireless?

I played the role of Mega Man, for instance. It feels fantastic. Played Super Mario 3 for a while. Played Super Mario 1 for a while. Played Castlevania. Played The Legend of Zelda and Zelda 2. Played, are there games in Virtual Console? Well, I think the important thing is that they are recreated more faithfully than they are a Virtual Console. Virtual Console is really dull and the colors are just, it's the, it's like the brightness is turned down a lot of the things. So it's like these are like how they're supposed to be.

There is no controller, especially like we were talking during the unboxing, having a controller that isn't all gross and yellow and there's a warrant out is all shit. Like that's cool. And I understand the form factor's cool. But yeah, just the excitement surrounding it as an outsider who has no nostalgia for the NES and was like, I have you many will play this game for a while. Yeah, but I think it's, it is having all of them in one place that's not the Wii U or the Wii, you know. I think that it goes a long way to for a Nintendo to distance themselves from those systems because people hate them so much.

I think it's, I think it's in terms of like, I understand exactly why people want it. There's no collab, like a combination of better, more important games anywhere than what's on this particular piece of hardware. Like if you look at the top 25 or even 50 games all-time, like more than about half of them are on that thing. It's, it's, it's pretty significant actually. Mario 3 is on there, original Mario 1, Castlevania games, a Mega Man game, Ninja Gaiden. I mean, these, there's really without two Zelda games.

I can't think of a better deal actually than the amount of, you know, the original Final Fantasy's on this thing. It's a lot of bang for your buck here. I, I, I think it makes perfect sense and I hope it does really well. I hope we get more of them. I don't say it doesn't make sense. I don't know your disagreements just be explained why it's important. I just think that yeah, that all the games are available in other places, but they are better on this than they are there.

What do you guys think of the trailer? Fine. That's fine. I don't even want to see anything else to be honest. I'm good. I was alarmed there wasn't more to it. I thought there would be more gameplay in it. I thought there'd be a release date. I'm not confident that they're gonna hit this Spring thing.

I was just playing in a second going, the what I was thinking about is, I'm just gonna sound weird, so stick with me. In terms of, and I'm talking about probably PS3 on GTA, jumped out right and started trying to be grounded in real. Like when you think of Niko, you think of GTA IV right now. And I'm not talking about the DLC, which I guess a little bit different. But those worlds, they're trying to make feel real. And then when they come out with GTA V, it's bright, but it's not, it's, you know, still dealing in, it's got the GTA funniness and the commentary on society. But it's all over.

You have like, you know, my problem with Watch Dogs 1, right, was where Aiden and we have some horrible, I think was it, was his nephew was killed or whatever. So it's like dark cloud of like, why you're out doing all this shit. Whereas here, you're this hacker, right? You're Marcus. You're, you join up with this other group of hackers and the grand scheme is just getting started. We're, we're out having fun and we're not doing this. And they're the worlds are colorful. Immediately it tells you to go to the store and buy clothes. There's all these cool outfits to get. And not cool like, I'm in a chicken suit.

The, it's fun to jump around and have fun and be encouraged to have fun in the game in that, if that makes sense. We're like, I was telling you when you got here today, like one of the things is I, they send me out of, you know, DedSec headquarters. I go on my first thing and they're explaining the game to you and like, you know, what's happening right now. And the story is, I've been it, you know, initiated in this hacker group, DedSec, in a bunch of quick cutscenes or whatever. Like, okay, cool. I have a one-night stand that doesn't matter at all.

The whole thing we're doing is we need to get the DedSec app on as many people's phones as possible.

People understand when they DedSec, like, you know, there's renegade organization. People know if they do when they download it. But it's about getting followers.

The whole thing I always thought in both GTA IV and GTA V, the phone was clunky. It didn't feel like a real phone. The phone I'm using in this game feels real. And it's like when it vibrates, it sounds perfect. And it's giving the actual information I need to do. I go in to pull up your maps when you're, you're driving, right? Like you have your own MP3 player on there. An app you buy right away for like three bucks, whatever, not real money, in-game money. You're driving around.

Okay, cool. I'm gonna do this and running around doing that. It feels like not the farcical, you know, Los Santos world of GTA, but a more colorful San Francisco, at least for where I am right now. Again, this is all based on two hours. Maybe he gets super crazy, you know, there's different things. But running around doing all these different things, it's fun. You know, from youth Watch Dogs 1, the hacking never felt natural. It never felt fun. Like turning on the lights, turning off lights, whatever the hell that is, right?

And when we did that let's play though, we just shit around. We just drove around San Francisco. What does San Francisco look like? How do we interact with different people and do all these different things? What happens to them? Now that I'm actually going through it, I'm surprised at how much fun it is to be this character of Marcus and come into a thing and be like, all right, cool. Go up in the camera.

I don't think people are looking at this the way they looked at Assassin's Creed 2. I think that it's actually been one of those games that we kept forgetting about.

And so I'm just hacking strangers and like, \"Alright, yeah, let me read your text message. You're listening in your phone call,\" right?

They have a really good cast of characters and I'm excited to see what happens with it and I'm enjoying playing it. So there's gonna be a lot of comparisons to GTA, yeah, obviously with this game. But for me, GTA, I've always enjoyed just kind of running around having fun a lot more in the world that have shared me the actual missions.

You jump off the like, though you, you're on a crane at one point, but then you come down, it's like a glassed-in like campaign office reception. There's a good drone that you go and, yeah, I was looking at it and it was just like, this is boring. Yeah, walk like, this is a mission I don't want to do. Yeah, playing through it.

I, it really comes off right now as far as how do you want to tackle it? Because for me, in that demo, it was always weird to see him slinking around in the campaign office with his gun drawn, right? And popping up and shooting after doing the whole drone thing. And I was like, that doesn't fit what this is. And so without the game beating me over the head with it, I'm not playing that way, right?

Oh, no, that in that world, this or this world, it's fine. It's just that's not how I'm playing it. So like, I think a good example of it, right, is like, I went there, I scoped out this entire area, right? I bopped around the security cams, I set some traps, and then I, you know, went up and dropped the, not the drone, the robot car guy, 'cause that's all I have right now. And I drove that around, right? And when it was, I done, I got in there, I hacked the thing I needed, and he can pick stuff up. So if you're collecting something, the little guy picks it up.

Think I didn't go through choking people out. Like I distracted them that, you know, the first thing I put my research points into was being able to track them on their phone so that when I do want to get deeper in, I can get through there. You can electrocute them, stun gun if like in the worst case scenario. But even that so far seems super foreign. I'm sure as we get in, it's going to be, here's this place with 17 people. But even the first real mission of like proving yourself to them, I was doing the stealth route of it. It wasn't going in guns blazing.

Yeah, they dropped us in five hours and, yeah, and that was the problem. So far, that's not the thing. And it's like, it's for me, it is that moment of like, oh, this is how we should have done that when we didn't know what was going on.
