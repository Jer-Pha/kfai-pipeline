Back from real America. Relax. Back from real America. How was it? It was great. What Vita games you play? Uh, Castle Invasion: Throne Out. Pretty good. Yeah, just came out in October on PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Vita. Okay. It's like tower defense game, 50 stages. You're like trying to get three stars in each one by doing certain things. I got 100% of the trophies in it. I thought it was uh, was fun. I mean, it's not like this dramatically fantastic game. It's the best tower defense game I've ever played, but uh, kept me busy. It's probably, I don't know, I probably played it uh, seven or eight hours before I I did everything 'cause I went back and got all the stars. And how does it compare to PixelJunk Monsters? It's not on PixelJunk's level, but um, but it's it's different. You're so basically on the left, on the yeah, on the left side, it's the same",

And uh, on the left side is like a castle and there's like a comedic story where a king's trying to take the castle and so he sends all his men out over and over again. Yeah. And so you have like a bow and a crossbow and like a spear and uh, slingshot that all do different kind of damage. Sure. Um, and you're just trying to keep everyone away from the castle. It's pretty pretty straightforward. There's some cool quirks in it, like there's a every once in a while drunk people like just drunk peasants will be in there and you don't want to hit them.

I bought um, uh, God, I can't remember the the game that's based on the fonts. You know what I'm talking about? That came out like a couple months ago in Vita. I can't remember the name of it now. Um, uh, jeez, I don't know. I can't remember the name of. Wait, what do you mean it's based on fonts? It's like a side scroller like based on like Helvetica and all these things. No, no, no.

I didn't do the way they wanted me to do. Yeah, I liked it. And uh, yeah, and then I downloaded something else, uh, Exile's End, whatever that game is called. It's like kind of a Metroidvania, but I didn't play that yet either. I mean, I was I I had intended on playing more, but um, with the exception of the flight there and the flight back, I basically didn't touch my Vita at all.

Of course, it's quite rigorous. Uh, got home at like 10:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m. on Saturday. Watched some Black Mirror, ate a cheeseburger. Yeah. Then I went into from Roma on Union. Yeah. Then I went uh, to lay in bed. Sure. Erin's cousin and her friend were there. They were watching in bed with you? No, they were watching in the living room. They weren't they were watching in the living room. I mean, I understand how based on the structure of the sentence that you kind of drew that draw that conclusion, but they were watching An Idiot Abroad and I went to the, which is a funny show, but I went to the bedroom, laid down and was playing Vita, fell asleep, woke up 1:00 a.m. Oh, got up for a little while, did something",

So I'm feeling pretty refreshed. But the point of that particular story was that I had nothing to play on PS4. So I was playing Ironcast. Still good. I told you about that one too. And uh, I think I'm just going to take credit for that one. Then then what happened was uh, we got the Final Fantasy XV code, right? How much you put in? Uh, I so I downloaded it. Yeah. And then it has that, it does that tricky thing where it's like, oh, it's only 13 gigabytes. And then here's another 40 gigabytes. Jump on in. Jump in. It's like, you're **** like, God damn it.

I I don't wanna I don't want to say 30 minutes. You are you interested to playing more? Yeah, definitely. But I I hate those **** characters already. I just hate them. I hate the boy band. Like I just hate those charac. And I was surprised to see like our friend Vince wrote a review. I read a little bit of saying like the characters were some of the redeeming qualities of the game.

And uh, maybe by the time this goes up and it's, I kind of feel like that should be our priority, you know, like in terms, you got Tim Gettys obsessed with Final Fantasy XV. We can keep playing whatever the **** we want. Exactly. So and we have to go to PSX. Everything's all **** up. So when Tim Gettys chimes in here for topic of the week or topic of the show, I guess topic of the week's copyrighted by IGN.com, uh, trademarked by P. S. Schneider.

And I think that's kind of extraordinary. So it's so in terms of people that have been waiting for a long time for these games, as we all have, yeah, it's a pretty pretty meaningful time. And I hope they're very both very good. It seems like Final Fantasy XV is what I thought it was going to be, which is good. And uh, you know, we'll see what what The Last Guardian pins up. But that's basically it. Gotcha. How about you? Uh, you know, Thanksgiving.

And it was weird. And like that's what I did every one of the days. And so it put me way behind on everything I needed to be. And let me tell you right now, in terms of this Watch Dogs 2 Platinum ****, this multiplayer. Now, not that I hate the multiplayer. I'm sure some people would like it and enjoy it or whatever. That's good on them. You know, you and I, we aren't multiplayer kind of guys. But this going out and getting bounties and ****.

You have to find somebody who just doesn't know what the hell's going on to really get it done and be fine with it. Which I was able to do 'cause sometimes the game, like the one where I got the hacking trophy of hacking another player, right? It hap it happened for me is that I got dropped above him on a like pretty much on the Golden Gate Bridge and was able to look down, hack him. And then he was in the middle of a firefight. So he didn't have time to worry about me hacking him. I was like, great. The other times I was getting dropped in, you're dropped in, he's like on the other side of the wall. It's like, well,",

And then the other same too with this like the B this Bounty Hunter mode, right? Of like you, they have to kill five guys and says, you know, take out five Bounty Hunter dudes. And I was doing it and I'm jumping in there and I thought I was making progress 'cause sometimes the cops, like I'm getting dropped in, the guy's, you know, 900 meters away or whatever. So I'm getting in a car, driving over to go get him or whatever. Cops kill him before I get there. Sometimes I'm tossed in there.

But you know what? I made I think I got three in a row yesterday and then started getting into that thing. Of course, multiplayer mode's all **** up still. It wasn't online forever. Then sometimes I'm like, all right, cool, let's do the Bounty Hunter mode. Spins and searches million regions. Doesn't find me anything. It seems like I have to go do a real mission in between every one of these when I'm just want to get this **** trophy off my **** mind because once that's done, it's that's done.

Uh, yeah, that they were like, yeah, it's underperformed the week one sales of what Watch Dogs, the original did, which I think most people would have expected seeing how the original Watch Dogs was touted to be this next gen da da da. But it's still their statement actually is interesting because their statement last week was, you know, yeah, it's underperforming, but we think that, and it's totally PR spin, obviously, reviews and streamers and all this other stuff, there's a chance for this game to still be super successful.

Although I still feel, and I talked, I won't beat a dead horse or listener, but last week with Danny O'Dwyer, I was talking about this where the people I was playing with in the we over the weekend, not this weekend, but last weekend, we were all saying how this game has no business being this good and this fun. And it's a game that snuck up on everybody. I was sitting around talking with these are all our, you know, our pals and Scott Lowe and those types. And how that was really interesting.

Now do you guys remember one of the many reasons Final Fantasy XV was delayed? Wasn't it to avoid such a thing from happening? Question: Are you sick of developers lying about this trash? In this case it had been delayed so many times I'm sure they were running out of excuses but no one is talking about the fact they lied just about what's in this update.

I actually think that not being, being released, I actually think that not releasing an exclusive game in this already packed window rather than doing so, Sony benefited Sony in terms. He's saying it's a bad thing to go up against all these things. He's getting a little off, off the topic there. Take for example, Uncharted 4. When it came out, it was all over the news on how great it was and that it was selling really well. Remember when it was supposed to release in the fall of 2015, a window that had sales heavyweights like Fallout, Call of Duty, and Star Wars Battlefront?

Let's be honest, it's not really because these games were bad, just that they were drowned in a release window that consists of other main shooter games. So question one: Do you think with the given sales of these games Sony should keep doing what they are currently doing (parenthesis which is release their exclusives throughout the year and support the third-party games that have always that always release in the fall anyway, Call of Duty, Ubisoft action adventure, etc.)? Question two: Do you think more game Publishers will move their games out of the Fall lineup given the sales of these three excellent AAA games?

Um, I was reading some anecdotal evidence that you're seeing 20 and 30% conversion rates on digital platforms now, which is insane. Um, and I don't think the Gears thing also counted all bundles. So there is contrary evidence on a much weaker selling platform that a big exclusive like Gears actually sold extraordinarily well. Um, I bet you Gears sold first of all way better than Titanfall on both platforms and uh probably sold comparably uh to Titan or to Call of Duty or not necessarily Call of Duty, maybe maybe Call of Duty, but certainly Battlefield on a platform by platform basis, which I think is interesting as well.

Just wondering both of your thoughts on forgotten PlayStation IP or from large companies such as EA and Ubisoft. Why do franchises like Heavenly Sword and Dead Space become completely dormant instead of having more developers similar to Sanzaru pitching ideas for a new Sly Cooper and ultimately getting a chance to create a sequel or reboot like that?\" Colin, it's a switch. It's not a game. It's a question about forgotten games. I think we already kind of answered it though, right? Not everything is be a **** franchise. Yep. Dead Space had three chances and it got it was good, got great, then it went nowhere. Like that, you know what I mean? That's how it's got to be.

Everyone agrees. But I'm glad I'm glad you feel that way. The uh the thing with Heavenly Sword is that Ninja Theory had uh was ready to do the sequel. And I think that I don't remember, it's so long ago, they were in some sort of pre-production or they had everything written up. And I think that that that Hellblade game is somewhat of a spiritual successor to to to might be the same.

Yeah, um, which can indicate, you know, I was reading one rumor that's saying that the the change might be that like games that you that have the new patch notes, in other words, if your name is ABCDE and you want to name it, you know, XYZ or whatever, in old games your name will still appear as ABCDE, but your name will appear in XYZ in newer games.
