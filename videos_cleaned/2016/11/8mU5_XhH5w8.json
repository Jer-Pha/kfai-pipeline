I was going to do the Uncharted ditty-doo, but that doesn't make sense for Tomb Raider. There's no iconic Tomb Raider song for me to do. Oh my God, over on Kotaku, Jason Schreier wrote an article called 'Name of Next Tomb Raider Leaks' because a guy had it open on the subway. Redditor Triple H 80 reported that he was riding a Montreal Subway and took a picture of a guy's laptop, and if you zoom in a bit, you can make out the name Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which is also a name we've heard floated for the next game in Lara Croft's iconic series.

A source told me today that this is indeed the name. It certainly fits with the last two games, Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider. Square Enix has not yet responded to a request for comment. Uh, quote, 'The page he was on talked about visuals,' Triple H 80 told me. 'I'm from Montreal, Quebec. I was going downtown for work, blah, blah, blah. I saw some stuff, it was blurry, you can't really see anything.' But wait, you might be thinking, 'Isn't Tomb Raider developed by Crystal Dynamics, the studio in San Francisco?' You'd be right, except we hear Eidos Montreal, the large studio behind Thief and Deus Ex Mankind Divided, is helming Lara's next adventure. Coincidentally, Eidos Montreal is just a few minutes away from Ubisoft Montreal, whose employees accidentally revealed Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag on an airplane three years ago. So with",

And also, what you think about this, especially you as the uh, the big Tomb Raider guy. And this, this Tomb Raider specifically, what do you think about the name? What do you think about it not being Crystal making it? And what do you think about Eidos making it? See, you threw me 'cause I was going to say I was going to answer all the questions the same way. No, but I don't mind about the name. The name's good, whatever. Shadow of the Tomb Raider, okay, cool, whatever. Um, it's, it's if it's true that it's Eidos, right, and it's not Crystal, I'm like, 'Oh, that sucks.' And it's not that Eidos is a bad studio, you know what I mean? People **** love Mankind Divided.

I get that they're talented, I get they know what they're doing, but I love Crystal Dynamics and I love what they've done with these two Tomb Raider games, and I want to see them continue to do it. And them not doing it then is like, 'Oh, so what are they doing? Are we going to get a Tomb Raider every year now? Are we going that kind of way?' The word is is that they're also working on a Tomb Raider. Are we getting these interstitial like Tomb Raider, like where it's going to be like where Assassin's Creed, it's going to be like Call of Duty? And then is that too much Tomb Raider?

Um, it's also, I don't, I mean, like, based on the blurry image and everything else, the name alone, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, right? That, and it's Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and it's another studio, makes me go, 'Is it Lara, or is this someone in her shadow?' Is the, like, the fact that it was Rise, you know, Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Shadow of the Tomb Raider. She's in her own shadow, like, you know, there's something usually to read into these names. And is she in the shadow of her father, which is a big theme of Rise of the Tomb Raider, and obviously with the Blood Tie stuff, they were still driving how much family means and how much she was chasing that. But we've never referred to her father as Tomb Raider before. We knew he was, but like, this is Rise of",

So, so you play as the butler who's always felt like he was in her shadow. Exactly. He's finally going to get his mo. Yeah, but that, and then it's like, I, if what if it is some kind of weird prequel thing where it is, I'm playing as a younger version of her father that's setting up her, like, I don't want that crap. No, just let me be Lara, I mean, let's go be Lara Croft. There's no way that they thr... I'm just saying, we're in the tree of trust here, we're just talking about crazy things, what could happen or whatever. Uh, so the name, fine with Eidos. I'm, I'm okay with it, whatever.

And he's here. I, I don't know what that means to have Eidos up there. But he also did talk about how he's got his, you know, his hand in the comics and in the movies and all these different things. There's so much going on. And I guess even then, that's the other thing too, the movie. What if this plays into the movie, right? And he, this is, and he was cagey about this on the Gamescast, but like, the movie is in the universe of the game. So what is this? Yeah, is this a tie into to that and all these different things?

Yeah, but no, I mean, it's so that's what it is on the Tomb Raider side of it, on the leak side. But it's like, 'Oh man, really? On the subway, you're going to have your computer open with an unannounced confidential game on it?' And I was talking about this in Kinda Funny Live, right? I think it goes to show something that I think a lot of people in this industry take for granted is the fact that gaming is huge. Don't forget that gaming is huge. And like, I'm sure for this person, 98% of the time, he meets somebody or he's on next to somebody in the subway and they have no **** idea what he's doing.

I like to imagine it's real Triple H, uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, he just wasn't first on his name. Yeah, so we had to, 'Damn it, Stephanie, what do we do?' What are your takes on this? Um, I think it's unfortunate for the guy. I think he, though, I was talking about this with with Greg, it's, it's kind of one of those tough things where I think he probably should be fired, um, for for doing like, for being so careless.

I feel bad for him because he was probably like late to work or working on his presentation, or it was a careless move. And I feel bad for everyone involved in the game that that happened. But I'm glad that it happened in the sense that, um, we like these kinds of leaks and on our side, because it's fun to to to talk and conjecture about these kinds of things. So I wish that guy, first of all, I wish that guy the very best. I hope that I hope he doesn't get fired, but I think he, um, will probably face some stiff discipline because this is a, this is a big deal. This is a game that they're dumping probably tens of millions of dollars into, too. So again, this is happening in",

Yeah, I'd definitely going to fire him. And I, I think that he definitely should be reprimanded, but I, I think firing might be a little too extreme. But I would put the fear of God. You know what, you don't see Rockstar guys ever leaking anything. You, well, I mean, and that's the thing about it is, you talk about, we talk about, we talk about leaks and all these different things, and yeah, Rockstar doesn't do this thing. And you know what, Naughty Dog, right, when they were leading up to The Last of Us, they had, they put out that email, 'Don't be that guy,' right? 'Don't be the guy who **** this up for everybody.' And so it's weird that it keeps happening because you'd think, 'Okay, I'm on a game development team. I know I'm working on a major franchise in Tomb Raider,' and",

And especially like on our side of the industry, with the amount of access we have and the people we talk to and the embargos we're under and the, it's all, you know, it's always somewhat offensive, especially when we're out with like a friend we've had for a long time where they're like, 'Oh, we're working on this unannounced project.' Like, 'All right, we're off the record, you can tell me.' But there is that part of them that doesn't want to give it up because they don't want to be the guy. They don't want to be the one who screws up or leaves their iPad on a plane. We talk about this all the time, but it's like when we know things that we're not supposed to talk about, it's hard to not talk about them because then you're like, 'Wait a minute, do other people know this?

That's the thing too, where I think we, I, I think I can speak for myself, but I think for both you guys too, is that we then often overly play it safe. Yeah, well, I know on Colin and Greg Live, we'll talk about stuff, things will come, come up, and we know the answer to what the question is or whatever. So we read the story and we just go, 'Let's not even discuss it. Let's not even give one of us the option to be like, wait, does, did he ever say that publicly? Did she ever do, you know, blah?' Yeah, that's my whole problem, and I've talked about it in the past. South Park delay was a good example where we knew about that for a long time, and I was like, 'Is this?' You kind of start wondering like, what world do you live in where it's like, 'Do people know? Is this public?' So",

We know a ton of things that are still not announced. But the, the, the, the thing here is that I just think it's on that particular situation is, and unfortunate for everyone involved in the game. And you just don't see massive studios don't do this. The way Destiny leaked, for instance, was someone left a **** binder in a restaurant. That's how Destiny leaked, right? Like, that's a careless move, but not quite as careless as having your laptop open in a **** subway. Um, so I wish the guy the best, but it's different. Like, Red Dead Redemption has been in development for like five years, no one said a **** word. So, so there is the fear of God. There's a different, like, if I was, I can't imagine what they do to people at Rockstar that would even think about doing something",

Um, so, uh, but as far as the game's concerned, so I thought I read, and I thought it might not be in that piece, but I thought I read somewhere, it is conjecture, I don't have any connections on this game at all, that the, the, there was a source saying Crystal is working on Tomb Raider. So it sounds like, yeah, so it sounds like there are, could be, I want to say are, it sounds like there could be two Tomb Raider games. And, and this is what came to mind for me was Batman: Arkham Origins, um, and then Batman: Arkham Knight, um, being kind of developed. And that's the big, the big push.

I mean, I used to play Tomb Raider when I was a kid, but, um, I don't have the connection Greg as a Tomb Raider. But it doesn't sound out of the, out of the ordinary that that might not be a Lara Croft story specifically because, um, it seems like that story is wrapped up in, or that that arc is wrapped up at Crystal. It would be interesting to see if it was a prequel, uh, similar or something that takes place in between the games, similar to, uh, uh, Uncharted on Vita or something like that. But, uh, it would be cool to see a different character or someone that like a bad guy or some different perspective or a different Tomb Raider or whatever.

But if there's a fourth game in development in the, in the new reimagined series, and I am getting a little concerned that Square Enix is going down the Ubisoft like, 'Let's **** milk this thing for what it's worth,' and I think that's a huge mistake. And I can't imagine that's what it is, not knowing what the hell's going on. I can't imagine that it is Shadow of the Tomb Raider and then Crystal Dynamics' third Tomb Raider game. That seems like too much, especially based on the fact that these games have been critically... I, I, I see it off the side, sorry, I see the PlayStation, you know, collector edition thing.

But I mean, even when Rise came out and it was Xbox exclusive, the numbers were super soft. I haven't heard anything about what the 20-year celebration's done yet. Oh, I mean, it just came out too, so exactly. But so it's like, that seems like you're about that, you're the fire, you're going to put the fire out probably to put too much into it too fast. Yeah, it's not runaway, it's not Assassin's Creed, it's not people banging on the doors. People love Tomb Raider, I love Tomb Raider. It's their 20-year, great. You know, Megan just made that book and all these different things. But like, I don't think there's a need to rush out just yet and be making a game every year and a half.

They look what they did, Final Fantasy 13, it took a terrible game, made even worse, and then maybe even worse than that, um, three times over. But they typically show, they're just not Activision and they're not Ubisoft. And Ubisoft is somewhere in the middle. I think Ubisoft learned their lesson and they're certainly, you know, not showing a little shame with Far Cry. Show, it would be way easier, and you know, it's what we talk about with Rockstar, and I've said it many times where if I were Rockstar, it would be hard for me not to say like, 'We're going to just contract five different studios and have a Grand Theft Auto game literally every year,' you know, but",

This is something totally stupid, random. I, there's nothing to back it up, but let's play a fun game together, best friends, mark this down. Uh, the other day, I finally checked my Reddit DMs, which I never, ever do, my Reddit private messages or whatever. And some guy hit me up saying that his friend, uh, gives a Rockstar, his friend gives, uh, tours, uh, or something like that, not tours like, you know, like, 'Here, **** the house,' whatever, but he's a location scout, and people from Rockstar were down in Miami, uh, doing that.",

Well, so what's interesting about this is, uh, next week on Gamescast, I want to revisit this, but there was a topic I saw on NeoGAF of a bunch of leak stuff, and I, I don't know if it was confirmed or not, but, uh, it wasn't confirmed, but if it looks legit or not, but of kind of a road map of a bunch of different plans they have for GTA 5 and for its online mode they're doing.
