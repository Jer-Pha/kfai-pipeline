Hey Mom, how are you? Good. Mom, what is your experience in the world of video games? Slim to none. You had a Wii, that was it. You had a DS, you bought the DS, but do you play little hand? Yeah, every once in a while. You bought it all by yourself. I play the brain game in it. You got a horse game too. Oh yeah, and you couldn't figure out how to feed the horse, right? So and that was the end of that game. Well now I can get a new horse every once a while, R, but you still can't feed him, right? Right. Yeah, that's the problem with that. Never figured that out. Well, have you heard about PlayStation VR? Um, yeah, I have. What do you know about PlayStation V? Very little. It's supposed to be virtual reality 3D. Reminds me of the um ride at Disney World, Soaring, Soaring California or whatever, right Kevin? You're a big Disneyland nerd. Yeah, Soaring. I I rode that",

Yeah, Soaring. I I rode that. I have a feeling this is going to feel like that. Okay, okay.

Okay, I'll make sure you fall out your okay great. Uh we're going to play it. We are big fans of PlayStation VR, of course. Full disclosure, PlayStation did send us this unit for review in Let's Plays like these and not that it mattered, we would have bought them on our own anyway. Um so let's let's get going.
