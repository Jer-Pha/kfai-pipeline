The watchmaker's goal is to change the way consumers think about fashion by offering high-quality minimalist products at revolutionary prices. We got ours, they're legit. Kevin Coello says that his is sexy as hell and it fits really well. Those are paraphrased quotes, but it kind of gets the spirit across. The company started by two broke college kids that wanted to wear stylish watches but couldn't afford them, so they started their own watch company. Kind of sounds like when we left IGN to do our own thing because, you know, we wanted to do our own thing. I respect that. MVMT Watches starts at just $95. At a department store, you're looking at hundreds of dollars. MVMT figured out that by selling online, they're able to cut out the middleman and retail markup, providing the best possible price. We're talking classic",

We're talking classic designs, quality construction, style, minimalism. Over 500,000 watches have been sold in over 160 countries. Here's the deal: you can get 15% off today with free shipping and free returns by going to MVMTWatches.com/Kinda. The watch is a really clean design. Seriously, Kevin's making compliments, everybody's loving him. Now's the time to step up your watch game. Go to MVMTWatches.com/Kinda. Join the movement. That's the tagline I like a lot. The next topic I want to talk about: Bethesda and game reviews. A hot topic. Here's a statement from Bethesda themselves: 'At Bethesda, we value media reviews. We read them, we watch them, we try to learn from them when they offer critique, and we understand their value to our players. Earlier this year, we released Doom.

We sent review copies to arrive the day before launch, which led to speculation about the quality of the game. Since then, Doom has emerged as a critical and commercial hit and is now one of the highest-rated shooters of the past few years. With the upcoming launches of Skyrim Special Edition and Dishonored, we will continue our policy of sending media review copies one day before release. While we will continue to work with media streamers and YouTubers to support their coverage before and after release, we want everyone, including those in media, to experience our games at the same time. We also understand that some of you want to read reviews before you make your decision, and if that's the case, we encourage you to wait for your favorite reviewers to share their thoughts.

Oh my God, it's amazing. Maybe things are changing. Maybe getting a game the day before review or the embargo release isn't the end of the world. And then they're like, 'We're going to roll the dice. You'll never know what's happening anymore with Bethesda.' And they're laughing all the way to the bank. Yeah, I mean, I think that it's, I think that the conspiracy theorist in me says that this was the intention for a long time, that Bethesda was going to do this, that Doom was intentionally the first game to do it with, because Doom, they knew Doom was great. They're not stupid. They made, they made it seem based on trends in gaming for years. We've been in this industry for time that",

Yeah, they're hiding it. They don't want you to know. They don't need to cancel your pre-order. They don't want the reviews to get in the way. So, you know, call me a conspiracy theorist if you may, if you might, that's fine. But I think that that was intentional, that they, you know, that they did that with Doom. And I tweeted that after this, that that said that it was actually a stroke of genius on their part because it sowed perpetual seeds of doubt in people's minds on if now a game being given a day before release or at release is going to be bad. Now we don't know. Like with Bethesda, we just don't know now. And actually, we were just talking about k K is the same. Civ 6 and",

It's, it's, see, I think it's a very deliberate and from a business standpoint, a very smart thing for them to do. I see a lot of people talking about this as anti-consumer, and I simply don't agree. There are three parties to this: there's the publisher/developer, there's the media/influencer/whatever, and then there's the gamer. This is a plus for publishers and developers. This is a negative for media and, and like YouTubers and stuff. And it's completely neutral for gamers. That's, that's the way I look at it.

It's going to hurt impressions. It's going to hurt views. It's going to hurt that ecosystem. And there's a lot of hand-wringing about that. And then everyone's saying, 'Well, it's anti-consumer.' I'm like, 'No, it's not. No one's forcing you to buy the game. Just wait.' It says it right here. No, no, I'm not, I'm not trying to be like, I'm not trying to be an apologist for them, but it says it, 'We also understand that some of you want to read reviews before you make a decision, and if that's the case, we encourage you to wait for your favorite reviewers to share their thoughts.'

If it's a season pass or if it's just DLC, everyone freaks out and this guy is falling, and that's just the latest one here. I give them credit for coming out and saying, 'This is our thing,' rather than just quietly continuing to not put out the games until the day before and every time have IGN and Kotaku and exite put up a thing of like, 'Here's why you're not getting our review on time. Here's what's happening.' They're coming out and they're saying that, 'All right, cool. We're the market has changed, landscape has changed. This is how we're doing it.'

The culture we live in is people screenshotting their PS4 with the countdown clock of how until this game unlocks, right? And for me, it's the, the way I deal with movies, right? Where I, there's a lot of movies I want to see. There's a lot of things we'll go see at midnight to go do reacts for. But if I'm interested in a movie, but I'm not going to see it at midnight, I'll wait, wait through opening weekend, see what my friends say, see what reviews say before I go invest hours into that, right?

Like, what's the quality of the reviews going to be? I mean, we were all at IGN. We know how that works. And we know, and, and I'm interested in what you think about this is just like, so now they have a day to review it, which is they have longer than a day. They have as much time as they want to take. But, but, but that's the problem is because of the ecosystem of the, the minus to the media is that they need to get the views, get, they need to be the first to put a review up. Like, there is an absolute thing of who's first, who's second, who's third. And then when you're the 10th person putting up a review, it doesn't matter. Who it doesn't affect is people like us, where we're just going to play it when we want to play it and how we want to play it, discuss it, you know? Well, I disagree that it",

I mean, I was talking about this to someone yesterday because people were being like, 'Why are you defending these corporations?' Like, I'm not necessarily, I'm seeing where they're, I'm saying where they're coming from. I'm not defending it. I want to be very clear. Like, if I was a publisher, I not, I'm not sure that I would want to do this yet. I understand the business behind it. And it probably does nothing but benefit them to do this. But it is not their problem. It is not Bethesda's problem if GameSpot can't get their review up in time. They don't care. Like, and it's becoming clear that like these publishers are, are caring less and less about traditional media as time goes on, right?

We might have had Mafia 3 impressions earlier than we did, which might have saved some problems, especially because the game wasn't very good. But that's again, not their problem. This is why I'm saying that this is a total neutral effect on gamers. Like, you don't have to pre-order games. You don't have to play the game the day, the day that comes out. You don't, if, if you keep saying that you have to, then frankly, you're the one that they're trying to pray upon. What it comes down to, what it comes down to with this is this says that they did research. There is data that backs up that positive reviews don't matter. Negative reviews do matter. So it's just like, you know, why would they, you know, kind of work with that when they could make more money? They're a business. And it's the thing. I mean, like, to the point that I think you",

I mean, like, to the point that I think you bring up that for me is a big one, right? Is like, the reviews will suffer. My problem with that argument is, and this is me throwing a stone at the IGN I worked at, that I was a part of IGN, we had Skyrim originally before release. No one caught that the PlayStation 3 version was bugged because that's not how you review games. You review one, you play an hour of the other versions. You're like, 'All right, graphics are a little less, whatever, da da da.' It's not, there isn't a scientific process. There isn't this checks and balances. There isn't a red team. It is, and I think what this is a reflection of is the fact that the jig is up on a lot of those sites, that the jig is up on the traditional games journalism module, right?

Watching a Twitch stream for 30 minutes to make sure it's running fine, that it is the Skyrim you remember, or Dishonored 2 is going to look cool and have cool things, that gives you enough information to go out and pre-order in that second, instantly on your PlayStation, on Steam, whatever you're, wherever you are. You're a click or a button press away from going to get that game. And you don't need necessarily, unless you're that person or that reviewer, the, 'Okay, I, I do want to see what Lucy O'Brien says about this game 40 hours from now.'

You know, like I made, I made my point clear. Some people disagree with it. Most people actually agreed with it completely, because I was just like, there seems to be shady ass business **** going on on one side. Obviously, you know, they have a fiduciary obligation to their shareholders, or if they're privately held, to whoever holds. We are shareholders of our company. You, you, they don't care.

And they were like, 'We gave that game out, we got that game out in October. That gave everyone enough time to create, craft their, their things, whether they liked it or not. Some people really liked it, some people thought it was okay or whatever. It probably damaged the game.' And they probably looked at that and was like, 'We have, we don't have to do that anymore. Like, we don't, we're not going to do that anymore.' Especially, and they can get away with the Skyrim because it's a known quantity. Dishonored 2 is not going to be the depth of an open world RPG.

And my argument to that is that's fine. I appreciate that and I respect that. But no one owes you anything. So like, they don't owe your audience anything. The game, they don't owe this audience anything. They don't owe us. We, we don't have Dishonored. We don't have any of these games. We're probably not going to play them anyway.

But it's their game. It doesn't really affect the bottom line for them and probably only benefits them. And it really only affects gamers because they're impatient because of the pre-order culture, because no one wants to like, you know, if you really want to wait, they said like, 'If you want, if you know you're going to like Dishonored, you like Dishonored, you're going to buy Dishonored, go buy it. I'm sure it's going to be great.' If you can't wait a week for people to get their stuff up, then that's fine, then don't. But that's not their problem.

So kind of like biting the hand that feeds. I mean, we've seen this kind of fall off over the last couple of years, and especially being at IGN, I brought this up, I think recently on Con Greg Live, when we were talking about this. But there's game developers with the ecosystem, they're now also delivering the message for whatever they want. If all of a sudden they're like, 'We're not giving IGN the trailer, we're not giving GameTrailers or, you know, whoever, the, the game trailers.' That's on them.

The, the middleman's being, having been cut out for a long time, and it might not benefit the consumer. I mean, that, that's up for debate, right? But like, from a business perspective, it makes perfect sense why Ubisoft has their own blog, why EA has their own thing going on, why Bethesda, you know, the guy who wrote this used to be the Editor-in-Chief of GameRadar, GamesRadar.

The issue with Bethesda's review policy is that they're more than happy to use those same outlets to get the word out via preview coverage. They want it both ways. They want the wait-and-see approach that naturally comes with previews, but won't face the music at the end. Lame. Then he goes on and somebody's like, 'Is this a thing of who will blink first?' Jeff says, 'Uh, this would probably just lead to to more paid influencer campaigns, and I'm not sure the audience would care. They'd get the coverage elsewhere.' And then somebody's like, 'They need to take a stand, not give them coverage.' 'Taking a stand like that only hurts your audience.
