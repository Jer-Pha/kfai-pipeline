I uh, didn't think that was going to happen. Um, but I'm also not surprised that it did because I did sit here at this table, tell you that the polls were catastrophically wrong. And I was right. Uh, I just didn't think that they were so wrong. And this is exactly what I said.

That's from the Los Angeles Mayoral race in 1982. So, uh, what happened is it's 290 to 232 in the Electoral College. You need 270 to win. So Trump has won.

He's probably going to lose the popular vote by more like one and a half million when everything's uh, tallied because a lot of outstanding votes are in California and Washington where a two to one are being voted. So he's getting, he's getting buried there. So for swing states, Clinton won New Hampshire, Virginia, Colorado, and Nevada. For swing states, Trump won Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Iowa. Um, and then the big thing here is that Trump won three states no one even had in play. So he won uh, Pennsylvania, which was the most likely of the three that he would win.

Uh, so a swing state is a, so you can pretty much look at the map and predict the way 40 states will vote every time. Um, so Texas is always going to go. Utah is always going to go to the Republicans. Texas will go to the Republicans. California is not even in play ever. It goes to the Democrats. New York, which was Donald Trump's home state, still not in play for him. Swing states are states that have heavily uh, polarized populations. They could swing one way or the other. Exactly.

And the big swing states are always Ohio, Florida, Iowa is not. Iowa is a swing state this time because Obama won it twice. Um, but it's, you know, so the, the big thing here is that Trump had this very specific path to win and he just nailed it in a way that no one ever thought. He had to win the Rust Belt. And so he did. Pennsylvania hasn't voted many, many cycles for a Republican since Reagan or actually no, Bush. So 1988, I think, was the last time.

Trump won 53% of the male vote and 41% of the female vote. Uh, Trump won 37% of the 18 to 29 vote, 42% of the 30 to 44 vote, and then 53% of the 44 to 45 to all the way up to whatever vote. Um, so obviously he won with older electorates. Race is always interesting. Uh, white people were 70% of the electorate and 58% of them went for Trump. Uh, the Black electorate was 12% and 8% went for Trump. 8%? 88% to 8%. That's higher than Romney did. Latino vote was 11% and 29% of them went to Trump. That's higher than Romney did unbelievably. And then the Asian vote was 4% and that's 29% to Trump, 65% to Clinton. And then other races, 56% to uh, Clinton and 37% to Trump. So",

Income, under $50,000, 41% for Trump. $50,000 or more, 49% for Trump. And you can boil it down there. Party ID, 89% of Democrats voted for uh, Clinton. 9% of Democrats voted for Trump.

The big takeaway now for our global audience is this: the 2015 elections in Britain were overwhelmingly conservative. No one saw it coming. Tory Brexit conservative won against all the polls. In Austria next month, a far-right coalition is going to win. Then in France, Marine Le Pen is going to run and she's probably going to win. And then they're going to vote to leave the EU and then they're going to leave the EU and then the EU's gone. And all of a sudden like that, complete political turmoil in Western Europe all and then in Germany, there's going to be another far-right uh party coming up. The thing is is that we are dealing with right-wing reactionary politics to left-wing politics to standard generational left-wing politics for a long time and it's not going to start, it's not going to stop here.

Muscle memory is defined on Wikipedia as being used synonymously with motor learning, which is a form of procedural memory that involves consolidating a specific motor task into memory through repetition. When a movement is repeated over time, a long-term muscle memory is created for the task, eventually allowing it to be performed without conscious effort. So some examples include riding a bicycle, typing on a keyboard, typing in a pen, playing a musical instrument, martial arts, dancing, commercial jingles, songs. So I want to know when does muscle memory kick in for you and what other memories go along with that? Commercial jingles and song. Yes, fall into this category. They absolutely do.
