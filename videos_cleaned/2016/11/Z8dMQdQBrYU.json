So there's the thing, I thought it would make sense for me to be here because I'm the anime guy, Greg. Yeah, me and Nick, we've been using it. We've been doing some watch-alongs. You can find those on youtube.com/KindaFunny. We watched the first episode of Yuri on Ice. We watched the first episode of Kill la Kill. Fantastic, really into this. So here's the deal, Crunchyroll. Yeah, you asking me questions, Greg? You're like, what is this Crunchy? What is Crunchy? It's anime. It's a place you can get a whole bunch of super cool anime, and some of it released four hours after it airs in Japan. I beat you to the bullet point about it, Greg. Crunchyroll.com/KindaFunny gets you a free 30-day trial of Crunchyroll Premium. What does Crunchyroll Premium get you?

Let us know in the comments of this video, 'cause I want, I, I'll go through one by one, look through the comments, comments, find the comments. Now for the head trip on the first one, is that similar to like The Magic School Bus? No, it's very different than that, especially and very different.

Yeah, when you break away and we all start going off to make our content piecemeal, the audience gets to vote and decide. And they get to sit there on Patreon, be like, no, here's the money. We would give you. GameSpot would want to put that into some other project, some other piece. Yeah. And then they'd let me know like how how, 'cause then that's like a really malleable thing.
