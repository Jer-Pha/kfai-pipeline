I think the environment will probably persevere. I like the plastic bag. What's up everybody? I'm Greg and this is my roommate, Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff, so every Tuesday and Thursday I reach into my random conversation pile, pull one out, toss it at Colin, and we talk it out for your amusement . Colin has no idea what is in the conversation pile. If you like that idea, like us here on YouTube, subscribe to us here on YouTube, and then in the comments below, make sure you leave your suggestion for a topic. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic is paper or plastic. This one's submitted by Michael Joe Vote. Now this this plays into a little bit of some of your personal tweets out there, no taxation. Uh, uh, San Francisco, they now charge you for the bags. Yeah, for paper bags, which is what is that all about? Um, I don't know. So I got a",

Yeah, for paper bags, which is what is that all about? Um, I don't know. So I got a conversation with about about the paper bag conundrum here that I I think began on October 1st of this year on Twitter with some people and a fee like this uh is generated in order to say like we want you to bring your reusable bag, reduce, reuse, recycle, yeah, all that garbage and uh save the planet, Colin. And so uh yeah, so they started to charge you 10 cents a bag in order to kind of, you know, pretend like they care about the environment, but really they just want to raise, you know, money and they probably prefer in fact that you don't bring your own bag and so they can charge you uh 10 cents. Now I I spent about $40 uh on my groceries, which makes a a a 10 cent per bag tax uh for bags about, you know, 2% extra tax on my on the money spent. So it's a tax levied against me, Greg. I don't really appreciate",

Nothing, just complain about it. Just going to keep living here in San Francisco, bitching on YouTube. That's what I do. Uh, no, I I think uh you know, back to I guess the question at heart, paper or plastic, they have their different uses. Now I understand that plastic bags are bad for the environment. Mhm. I think the environment will probably persevere. I like the plastic bag. It's very useful in a, you know, when we're taking out the litter for instance, you got some garbage kind of hanging around, you throw it in the plastic bag, you throw it out, it's totally fine there. The plastic bag is heavily reusable. You can probably use the plastic bag several times. The paper bag uh is",

You can probably use the plastic bag several times. The paper bag uh is recyclable because it's made of paper uh and itself is probably uh post-consumer paper mostly, so it's already recycled anyway. Now for the argument sake, you could use you could reuse the paper bag a few times, couldn't you? Sometimes that handle gives out. That's what I'm not a fan of when the you're you're walking somewhere and you get the tear in the paper bag, never never good. Yeah, I think the you know, I think generally, you know, it's nice to have choices and so you want both available to you for for different things. May you buy some, you know, we go to the vegetable store here down the street, a store I'm not a fan of. They go to the they give you the plastic bag, it makes sense. You're carrying your you're carrying your onions and your apples and your tomatoes in it and it makes a lot of sense.",

You're carrying your you're carrying your onions and your apples and your tomatoes in it and it makes a lot of sense and you're a little sack. Maybe you go and you buy some heavier groceries at Safeway, so you want the paper bag. I just don't understand limiting consumer choice based on pretending to care about the environment because I I environmentalism is good and I care about the environment too, but I think that you have to kind of do it, you know, you have to kind of convince people the right way to to to go about their business and in such a way that that's good for the environment. Is this similar to the whole hotel thing of oh man, leave if you we want to save the environment, get started on that shit. Well, we're getting you started right now. It's a conversation with Colin. Oh man, if you don't want your bed made then put this card on it or whatever and don't leave your towels on the floor if you want them",

I know I I hate that because you know, you see that at hotels all the time, but it's just a way for them to save money and it's the same thing with water bottles. Like you see a water bottle and they're like this uses 30 % less plastic. Well, it's like your plastic bill is now lower 30%, but you can pretend like you care about the environment you're doing because it saves you money and also you get to look good by putting on your product like we're very environmental because that's what's chic right now. It's been chic for a while and and that's cool. Being an environmentalist is fine, but like you know, it seems like people are are trying to do it in a way that is self-",

It's it's it's just you want people to be more environmentally friendly, but you penalize them monetarily and you kind of are going to generate uh funds where you rely on those that money. So it's kind of a catch 22 where you don't want people to actually get better. What if what if everyone did bring their own bags to Safeway and stuff then it's like a big win, but they raise no money. Yeah, so I'I'd actually see what the city council of San Francisco would would they prefer probably the hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in revenue that just these this 10-cent per paper bag tax is going to raise or do they care about",

I'd actually be interested to see the answer to that question. Okay, yeah, I like what you're doing though. Well, what do you think ladies and gentlemen? Would San Francisco enjoy the 10 cents or would they enjoy just everybody being all environmentally friendly, hugging trees or whatever the hell they do out there in Golden Gate Park? Uh, let us know in the comments below. You what do you keep talking what do you want? I said they said they do nothing in Golden Gate Park. Oh, I've been over there. Let me tell you the homeless population does a lot in Golden Park that you don't want to know. Yeah, a few other things too.
