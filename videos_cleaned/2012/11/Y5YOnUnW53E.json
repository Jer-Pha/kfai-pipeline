You're very picky about your bagels. Um, a good bagel is a bagel what is called a water bagel, um, which is a bagel that is boiled. Um, and these are differentiated from bagels like you would get at like a shitty place like Noah in which the bagels are like Einstein if you're in the other part of the country.

Uh, yeah, Einstein Bagels that are doughy and and basically just thick pieces of bread with toppings on them that are not really bagels at all. Um, yeah , I love a good bagel, man. I mean, there's nothing finer than a bagel. So you you descri you've described a big shitty piece of bread, Noah Bagel. What what is a good boiled bagel? What what should people be looking for? Uh, a good bagel is is a water bagel. You can tell just by looking at them, but for for the untrained eye, a water bagel is something that is um dense. Um, you kind of pull it open. It it should be the consistency like if you were to look at it and pull it apart, should be like four or five pieces of bread within the bagel basically. Like it's very thick, the calorically outrageous, five or 600 calories. Um, and you know, it's not that hard to make like they a good like a good bagel",

Everyone's like always like, what's your favorite bagel place on Long Island? What's your favorite bagel place out in Suffolk County? What's your favorite bagel place in the city or in Brooklyn or in Queens? And I'm like, they're all pretty much much better than anything you'll find in California. Yeah. Um, but uh, you know, but the shitty bagels have have kind of grown in in in their uh in their power. I mean, these just **** fo these bagels on the public like they're real bagels. Well, people don't know, right? You New Yorkers, you got this chip on your shoulder, you're so much better than the rest of us. You're not sharing any of your secrets here.

It's just it's just a fact. Like I I'm sorry that it has to be that way, but you know, we take it for granted when you're there and you grow up there and then you leave and you're like, wow, the food here sucks. Like when you're in Boston or you're in wherever you're in , it's just like the food here sucks. Like I want a good pizza. You go to Long Island, you go to New York, you get a good pizza. You want good Sean see that's the crazy thing. The craziest thing to me, Greg, is that the Chinese food in San Francisco is just not very good.

So you think that there would be great San here, but it's mostly Hunan, which is a different kind of Chinese food and it's just not very good. Yeah, you know, um I go home and I eat the good Chinese food there and and it's **** miles ahead of what's going on here. The bagels miles ahead of what's going on here. The pizza like in the stratosphere compared to to the pizza here which is like somewhere in the **** mantle of the earth in comparison. Yeah. Well, now let's not let's not throw Patxi's under the bus. You like a good Patxi's pizza. I like a good Patxi's pizza, but that's different. Okay, okay. Out there just saying it's not as Bleak as you make it out there. No, no, I mean if you're looking for Chicago style pizza, you're looking for something like you know, Patxi's is is good.

Um when I went home and I had Time Pizza, which is my favorite pizza in Brook Haven, New York, man, that stuff is so good. It's still so goddamn good, you know, and and the bagels, my favorite Chinese place is called How It's in Patchogue, New York. Um that place is excellent too, light years ahead of whatever the hell is going on in this city. Um so I'm I'm spoiled. San Francisco got good Mexican food. Oh yeah, I'll give it I'll give him that. Now here's here's the thing that's weird for me and I you not weird to you at all. You're I you know I'm raised I guess on just whatever a bagel is round it has the hole in it.

Um why don't you like the cream cheese? I don't like cream cheese, but I mean cream cheese is common. Everyone uses cream cheese everywhere. It's that's the most popular topping for a bagel uh anywhere I would say, but butter bagels are close second um in New York and I I'm surprised when I meet people out here that don't even know that that have never heard of putting butter on a bagel. Like that's just bizar. I remember the first time I ever brought bagels into work, Hillary and you asked for butter. I was like, what the hell is your **** problem? I don't know why would you want butter? It's probably in the fridge. You going to fry up an egg? I don't know what you need it for.

You know, there's nothing better than a cinnamon raisin bagel toasted with extra butter. I'll tell you what right the **** now, Greg, there's nothing better than that. And you know, at the same time you got a bagel sandwich like you know in New York we we have we eat a lot of bagel sandwiches and that's something that a lot of people don't do here. We have delis which are are very rare here. There are two things that are rare here that we have in New York that like are nowhere to be found in California, diners. Yeah, diners and delis. For some reason there's just no delis and there's no diners. There's a **** diner in a deli on every block in New York .

No one eats egg sandwiches anywhere but in New York. I don't understand like what like egg sandwiches are so like so common that you you order them in a very specific way. Two eggs, salt, pepper, ketchup. You know, you write it down twoe spk like if you have to like write it down. I used to work at at a deli. That's how you that's how you write it down. Like people were surprised that you put ketchup on a b like I remember ordering a bagel sandwich from this this one good place by where we work that Great American Bagel. They have great bagels there. They have great water bagels and I ordered a sandwich there and I'm like, can I have bacon egg and cheese? Can you put ketchup on it?

It's a geographic thing, but I'll tell you right now, I mean, I I've traveled the country pretty extensively um and no one eats eats as good as we eat in the tri-state area .
