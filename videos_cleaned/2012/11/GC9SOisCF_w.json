I'm Greg Miller, and while you were out living your life and chopping down trees, the fine people at Oreo are making endless variations of Milk's Favorite Cookie. So every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to this channel. Today we're reviewing Triple Double Oreo Neapolitan. Holy cow, ladies and gentlemen, what will they think of next? Of course, this is Triple Double week here on the show. Last week we had the Triple Double that was just chocolate cookie, white cream, chocolate cookie, chocolate cream, chocolate cookie. It was way too much chocolate. We didn't know we're getting to. Now we have Triple Double white cookie, pink frosting, uh white cookie, chocolate cream. You probably get the idea. It's neopal. Uh of course , every Oreo Oration starts with the first look. Tear it open. Again, very solid presentation. All the Oreos are intact. Let's get a smell.",

All the Oreos are intact. Let's get a smell test. I'm smelling a lot of the shortbread cookie again. Uh the sugar cookie taste I always talk about. Uh we we'll pull one of these bad boys out. You never know where you're starting from there. You go and there there it is. Triple triple double chocolate pink. See if it's got I don't know if it's the berry blast. I I imagine it is the same berry blast consistency of the pink. We all know I'm a big fan. Let's see what we get. I don't know about this one, ladies and gentlemen. Taste. Obviously this is a taste test similar to the regular Triple Double. Uh all I'm tasting is the cookie really off the bat. A lot of that shortbread white bread cookie, which I like. I like that short bread sugar cookie, but now it's a bit too much, a bit too much shortbread sugar cookie. Oh, the frostings are completely lost. I",

Oh, the frostings are completely lost. I guess there's a little bit of aftertaste of chocolate, but it seems like that pink frosting is getting in there knocking it out. I'm actually for my own edification, I want to know if it's very blast. Nope, it's not very blast. We'll see how these pair with milk. It's not it wasn't it wasn't bad. It was just imagine what pink tastes like and that's what that was. That's all it was like we're going to put pink in a cookie. Okay, this what it's going to taste like. All right, of course, milk pairing. We have to do the dunk test. One, two, three, see what we get out of this guy. Same problems we've seen with the white cookie before. The white cookie doesn't take the milk that well, so it's still very crunchy. Same problem as the last Triple Double where you bit into it and it was just all cookie. Uh you know, a",

It's it's no good. I'm not not I'm not feeling this at all. We'll do the twisting test because this is how you do it on Oreo Oration, but is nothing's going to save this cookie. Well, that's weird. Look at that. I didn't even realize they you get an Oreo indentation there and there that cookie. Well, that's interesting . At least I found something else out in this cookie. Time to review this bastard. Um H I'd say 55 mediocre. It's it's it's all right. I wouldn't buy this cookie again. You have to be a big shortbread fan, shortbread cookie fan to get it and that's all you want, but I don't like the aftertaste. It's too sweet. The pink is just pink. You can't taste the chocolate ever actually. Yeah, so I'm saying a lot of bad",

Yeah, so I'm saying a lot of bad things, aren't I? I'm I'm I'm for the first time ever on Oreo Oration, we're knocking out that that that's not the final score. 55 is not the final score. Knock it out. Knocked out real final score. It's the worst. It's the worst Oreo we've eaten so far on the show . I'm going to set the bar and we're going to drop it down to a 35. That's how review scores work that I start somewhere and then I just immediately change it. 3.5 out of 10. That's bad. Uh yeah, not a fan of this one. Um that's the way the cookie crumbles for the Triple Double Neapolitan Oreo, but I want your opinion. If you've had it before, leave a video response below, make it your review of the cookie, then subscribe to my channel while you're at it. Um are there Ore os I am missing? I'm sure there are.
