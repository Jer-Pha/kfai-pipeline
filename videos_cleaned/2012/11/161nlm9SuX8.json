I'm Greg Miller, and while you are out living your life, driving them fancy cars, seeing them movies, the fine people at Oreo were making endless variations to Milk's Favorite Cookie. So every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. Now if you like that, like this video, then subscribe to my channel. Today we're reviewing peanut butter Oreo fudge cream. Yeah, that happened. This is a real cookie, ladies and gentlemen. I know up until now we've done some different flavors, some different creams, some different golden kinds of cookies. Yeah, Oreo's gone bonkers. They've gone freaking insane and they've started fudge covering half Oreos. Now of course, I'm sorry Oreo, the way the show begins is the first look, which begins with the patented Nabisco seal technology. You tear it open. No, now, now we got our first look at how the cookies came out. Now Oreo, Nabisco, you know I love you. What, what is this? This",

Now Oreo, Nabisco, you know I love you. What, what is this? This is just like, it's like a bus ran off a cliff and everybody's inside's okay. All the children are okay, they're going back to school, but they're just tossed all over each other. They don't know. There's like, there's fanny packs everywhere, pencil cases. You're failing bad at the first look. I'll tell you what I do notice right away though, part of the first look of course is the bouquet of the cookie overpowering . You got the peanut butter smell coming at you right now. Uh, next part of course is the taste. We'll take this one which is just on top of all the other ones. He doesn't know what he's up against. We'll see how it tastes. Yeah, okay, I like what you're working with. Presentation issues aside, well done Oreo. All right, uh, you've got the thin cookie layer. I'll give you, I'll give you the snapshot here.",

I'll give you, I'll give you the snapshot here, the side, the thin cookie layer, then a big old dollop of whatever peanut butter they're using covered there in the fudge. It's a trip, man. It's a trip. I'll tell you right now. Oh yeah, the cookie itself gets lost in it. You're definitely tasting the peanut butter right off the bat and mixes with the chocolate. I mean everybody knows chocolate and peanut butter go together. There's another candy cookie out there that I won't mention it talks about this stuff a lot, but I like what I'm getting here. Sorry, I'm getting misty. This is a good cookie. We, we've made a good find here. I didn't know what I was getting into with the fudge cream. Now here's the big thing though, we're going to do our milk pairing of course. Oreos need to be tested with milk so they get a real variation here to see. Obviously I'm not",

Oreos need to be tested with milk so they get a real variation here to see. Obviously I'm not expecting much from this dunk. Now of course last episode, episode was the final golden episode. There was some debate over how the milk testing and the pairing went. There was too many dunks, maybe too little dunks. We're going to give three dunks from now on. I've just given three and I'll hold on the third for a little bit so everybody gets equal dunk and the fudge cream impervious to milk. It's like a condom over the cookie. You can't, it doesn't taste like milk, but the cookie itself still tastes good and you definitely want to follow it up with milk. Milk's a good pal, palet cleanser. Another one twisting, twisting is a big part of the Oreo Oration. No way to twist them so that's an NA. We're going to put up an NA over here. Milk testing, you know it didn't go well together. I can't fault it for it.",

Milk testing, you know it didn't go well together. I can't fault it for it. They're doing something different. My producers telling me I have chocolate all over my teeth. Here's a problem with what we're working with, the peanut butter fudge cream Oreos. They're delicious. They make you look like you've been eating mud all day long or something else, but I won't say. So peanut butter fudge cream Oreos, how do they fair on the scale? I'm a 20 point scale as usual. I gotta say, feel like I'm giving them out left and right. Another nine. It's another excellent cookie. The problem of course being that I don't get a lot of cookie. It's a very thin cookie. I'm not getting that the cookie part, but the fudge on top of the peanut butter, a really good mix. It's what you want. It's on the go. It didn't get my hands too filthy, made my teeth pretty bad, doesn't dunk well, can't be twisted. I can't",

They're moving into the next Millennia as they say. So that's the way the cookie crumbles for the peanut butter Oreo fudge cream. But what do you think? Leave your review as a video response below, like the video and then subscribe to my channel. Here's the most important thing, ladies and gentlemen, are there Oreos out there that I'm missing? Please leave the Oreos that you see in your neck of the woods as a comment below, then share the video with your friends, then of course like it, keep going, subscribe on Twitter, All That Jazz. I'll be back every Wednesday and Friday until I run out of cookies to review, but until then keep on dunking unless the fudge cream does not allow you to dunk at all. Oh.",
