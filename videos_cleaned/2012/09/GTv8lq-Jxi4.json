If you like that idea for a show, make sure you like this episode, share it with your friends, then subscribe to us on YouTube. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is spaghetti sauce. Oh, now you got the half Italian in you. How's that treating you? Uh, it's good. It's it's real good. My mom's Italian. Okay. And so you grew up making spaghetti sauce here? Well, no, I didn't grow up, that was your first job, wasn't it? Making your mom's spaghetti sauce? Yeah, it was my very first job. No, I grew up, uh, even though I have an Irish name and I'm, uh, I guess predominantly Irish, my dad's Irish, uh, my mom is Italian and we grew up with my mom's family on Long Island, so, uh, I grew up",

Okay. To you then, what's the key to a great spaghetti sauce? Time. Oh, I like that. Explain. Yeah, uh, I think, uh, we have our own recipe in my family. It's very secret and I actually was Tweeting about it not too long ago as I was making it. I was showing people pictures and kind of explaining a little bit and I actually got a not so sarcastic, uh, Tweet back or text message from my my brother-in-law who was saying my mom was looking at it and they're not pleased that I'm giving away too many of the secrets of sauce. Um, but I think, uh, first of all, I think jar sauce is an abomination. Jar sauce? The hell is that? Jar sauce. Oh, jar. I thought thought that was one of those words like a gyro . No, you mean like a jar, a jar pasta sauce? Terrible. That's what I that's what I eat what I grew up on.",

Um, but time is everything with with the sauce. Once you get it going, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of you're toiling away in the kitchen, you're getting the meat together, you're brazing the sausage, you're cutting up the garlic, you're doing all this ****, but then you just let it sit six, seven, eight hours, stir it every 20 minutes, let it reduce real nicely. It takes time and time is the essence of good sauce. So now why are you hiding this from everybody? Why won't why why won't your family share their their secret? If if I'm not supposed to eat jar sauce, white bread Middle America kid, how am I supposed to know what to go e do I have to go download a Rachel Ray recipe or",

If if I'm not supposed to eat jar sauce , white bread Middle America kid, how am I supposed to know what to go e do I have to go download a Rachel Ray recipe or something? I'm sure those recipes are great. I make the recipe that we make is Bolognese. Um, we are Sicilian, uh, which would indicate that we would actually use more, um, rustic ingredients like vegetables and stuff like that, but this is not a Sicilian recipe. Um, and the Bolognese requires, uh, a bit of knowhow in terms of, uh, at least in terms of ours of the little things you do to make it taste the way it does and every family has its own secrets and I don't think that I know plenty of mine are like, you know, my dad killed a baby duck once. I don't go bragging about it. Okay, well, I'm not bragging. I'm not bragging about this. I'm just saying it's a secret and and, uh, every Italian family that I've ever known and I grew up in a very Italian area, uh, has their own secrets and you readily eat the sauce and maybe you",

This guy likes to put vegetables in his sauce, but you don't really know why, you know how he's getting from point A to point B and that's kind of the the fun of it. When my mom taught me how to make the sauce and finally kind of bestowed upon me the knowledge, uh, she asked me to keep it to myself, um, and I did. Well, then you started Tweeting about it. Yeah, and then I I gave away some of the secrets, but like 10% of it, like okay, yeah, all right. Uh, so then tell me this then, as an Italian, what was your family's response when Olive Garden came in and kind of just made like nailed it, just showed everybody what a time? I'm I'm gonna be honest with you, I like Olive Garden. I think Olive Garden's pretty good, but I don't eat it because",

I think Olive Garden's pretty good, but I don't eat it because I'm like I want to have Sunday dinner with my family. I eat it because like I'm like, oh, this this chicken whatever the hell this is is pretty good over Angel hair pasta and I like it a lot. But when I you know I I think very fondly back about my my childhood, my my my grandparents are are dead now, um, but when they were alive and well, uh, we would go to my grandma's every Sunday, my mom or my grandma or whoever would make gravy, which is the sauce I may we call it gravy, um, and does that get confusing when you make mashed potatoes? Yeah, it does. It does. It does pasta sauce on the potatoes. It's one of those words like in the tri-state area like where I'm from, um, where you know the word hero for instance, the word hero to a lot of people is gyro, right?

Um, and so that's just another word like you hear the word gravy use for sauce a lot and that's just a word doesn't I don't know where the hell that came from. Um, but yeah, I think very fondly about it. We Italians know how to eat. We eat really well and, uh, I'm really proud of the sauce I make. I think it's really, really good. It comes out consistently, which is the most important thing as well, but it's because of the time and and and that you put into it, the energy, the essence of my grandparents in our lineage in Italy are all those important things and maybe one day I'll bestow upon you some of the secrets.

Yeah, yeah, you know, I can barely put together a plate of wings in there. I don't want to go in there be cooking for six hours. Fair enough to each it own, but I'm glad you enjoyed the sauce. It was delicious. You see, I'll give you one of the secrets. All right, and this is a very common thing. You break, you know, you form the meatballs. I'm not going to tell you what I put in my meatballs, but I say you form the meatballs, you take about, you know, a couple packages of sausages, five or 10 sausages if you have a big enough pan to accommodate them, you braze them, you bra them, you braze in it's a pan you just are are browning them, you're turning them, you're browning them, you're getting all the couldn't eat them yet and no, you couldn't eat them yet, but the key is to do that in the same pot that you are going to make the sauce in, okay?

And then big old pot. Yeah, big pot and you braze them on the bottom and then you remove the meat, then you put the sauce in and you do you work your magic with the sauce. Once the sauce starts to boil, you then reintroduce the meat into the sauce and you let the the meat cook in the sauce very slowly on the lowest heat you can possibly imagine for as long as you can possibly tolerate it. Um, and the ref from the meat and all that stuff just makes a it's just a **** million bucks. I'll tell you what. Well, Colin, I think that about wraps up this conversation. Thank you for your time .
