I call him sometimes, he says these crazy things. So every Tuesday and Thursday I reach into my topic pile, grab one, toss it at him, we talk it out. He has no idea what is in the topic pile. He hears them when you hear him. If you like that idea, like this video, share it with your friends, then follow or subscribe, whatever, whatever, follow us on the YouTubes, subscribe to us on the Twitters, whatever, it don't make sense, you see the annotations. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is rap rock. Oh yeah, you, you, you, it's one of those things that everybody remembers rap rock from the early aughts, the 98, 98. Oh yeah. Most people gave it up but you, you've held on, you've carried that torch. Why? I really like rap rock. I know it's not something to be proud of necessarily. I know a lot of it is uh musically bankrupt and not",

I know a lot of it is uh musically bankrupt and not very, you know, doesn't really require a lot of talent. There's a lot of bad rap rock bands and those bad rap rock bands ruin the entire genre, but there are a handful of good rap rock bands that I really like. So um that some of them still make music, some of them don't and I think it's a genre worth exploring because I really like hip-hop a lot and I really like rock a lot and I don't see why you can't combine the two into something that's great and and I think if you artists haven't managed to do that, who is still doing it well? Um well I think people, some people are gonna like this but I think Limp Bizkit when they came back and made Gold Cobra last year, yeah, it was a really great record and I think that they like totally fell off and I don't understand why people don't like",

I think yeah, well first to me at home who has no idea what we're talking about, why would people not like Bizkit? I think I think people don't like Fred Durst, yeah and and I understand that he's my Chocolate Starfish, yeah, yes of your chocolate, of your chocolate flavored water of course, but he got a like him, he's like a little bit brash and so with that I also understand people think that Limp Bizkit musically is actually really good and I think a lot of people really like Wes Borland who is their guitar, yeah, very, very technically talented guitarist, but when you think I think people are being a little bit hypocritical about rap rock and it bothers me a little bit because Limp Bizkit has sold millions of records, right?

A band like Linkin Park when they released Hybrid Theory which is a fantastic record, yeah, that's so not so much but there are some there some fans at Points of Authority and and Papercut and all those songs on that record are really good and those those guys saw Hybrid Theory sold so many copy busters is they saying yeah industry and and so but then that one Bizkit sucks with your Park sucked it's like nah you probably bought Linkin Park records new ball in fiscal records and you don't like them anymore because it's cool not to like them. Yeah, but I'm not I don't give a **** what anyone thinks about what I think so I like those records still and I like those bands and I think those bands are fun. Of course 311 is still my favorite band of all time and and they're a rap rock band that really doesn't do rap rock anymore. How do you feel about that? You still",

How do you feel about that? You still like them as a band even though it's smart? I think that they're really like self-conscious of their longevity and even though people like the things that they're doing in the early and mid nineties, I mean they've been a band for 23 years now so like the things that they were doing in like 89, 90, 91, 92 like real rap rock, like rap metal, rap core, those kinds of things. I'm doing that as 45 year olds doesn't look as much anymore and they can still play those songs and I've seen them play those songs alive and they're fine but I don't think that they want I think I want to set a different cadence so that when they get older it's kinda like the Beatles, like the Beatles first you know many records half-dozen records were very sing song and so like that but then when you got to like Sergeant Pepper",

They could even play those songs live. They didn't play those songs alive. They changed and I think that you know 311, I'm not trying to compare to go over there you just did though you just did compiler 311 but uh but so so I really enjoy that shot like rap rock is a genre I think it's really great and there are a lot of great bands that I think rap rock like anything else will come back. The only example of a Shondra that has not come back that I can think of is disco and people really hate this guy yeah and I think that some people really hate rap rock so do you think they hate him for the same reasons they worst overplayed everybody",

Yeah, I think I think that there's a level of like you know it's cool to hate these things on both sides. I mean think about like the Bee Gees, right? The Bee Gees are **** awesome. If you're gonna hate on if you're gonna hate on the Bee Gees you're kind of crazy. I mean they like that was very disco centric you know group and and they they did their thing or whatever even like ABBA if you listen to like some of ABBA's those songs are awesome better when they were the 18s remember the 18th Cameron yes I swear they Swedish like - yes I'm super attractive yeah okay yeah you enjoyed that yeah of course but yeah back to the back the topic of rap rock I think that it will probably come around at some point and I don't think there's anything wrong with enjoying the genre I understand why",

They're really what killing me yeah what do you think kill the rap rock? I mean I think that I think that Limp Bizkit, the Limp Bizkit's dive in popularity had a lot to do with the killing of rap rock. Well let me give you an example of the hypocrisy of what rap rock. Rage Against the Machine is the most prolific rap rock band of all time okay and Rage Against the Machine is really great. I'm a Republican, I'm a conservative but I really enjoy Rage Against the Machine. I think I think Tom Morello is awesome. I think exactly LaRoche is incredibly intelligent individual.

I think that you know those are really good songs when they came back and reformed a few years ago they played Coachella and all those things people went nuts . Yeah, I like that's a **** rap rock band. They don't sing anything that is straight-up rap rock and you love it but when other bands do what you don't like it anymore but you pretend that but they pretend that Rage Against the Machine is that rap rock. If you were to go oh you're a rap rock and I don't like rap rock oh but you're you just love Rage Against the Machine you paid three inch dollars it seemed a Coachella so you actually do like rap rock and you actually like the band up popularize rap rock because when you think about Chili Peppers and Urban Dance Squad and Rage Against the Machine and all these early bands that were doing it they were the ones that brought it to the for it to pave the way for 311 and Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park and and even smaller",

So I think people need to be a little more honest with themselves but the place rap rock has in the industry and rapcore and rap metal all that stuff and and understand that it's going to come back eventually.
