What's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg and this is my roommate, Colin. Now sometimes Colin, he says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday we spring a topic of conversation on him. He has no idea what is on the cards, what conversation topic he's going to get this Tuesday or Thursday. Colin, are you ready? Yes. All right. If you like what you see here folks, make sure you like this video, make sure you share this video, subscribe to GameOverGreggy. The first topic is the TSA. Colin, tell me about the TSA, Transportation Administration, that what I'm looking at here? Uh, Transportation Security Administration. That was close. I got some of them right. Uh, of course for our our friends to the north and other countries, uh, these are the people who check at the air airport, right? You're trying to get an airplane, they",

You're trying to get an airplane, they pat you down. Yes. Okay. Tell tell me about them. What do you think their role in our society is? I think that, uh, it's funny. Every time I go to the airport, I like to give the TSA agents a really hard time because, um, they don't serve a function is really useful to anyone. If you're a constitutional person and you believe in the Fourth Amendment. So, uh, I go there and I usually, uh, basically it's boiled down to illegal searches and seizures. Okay. Um, and since they work for the government and you're trying to just fly somewhere, uh, and they're basically just undressing you with their x-ray machines and putting their hands all over you and stuff like that. I just think it's, uh, it's unnecessary and unconstitutional and they haven't saved, they haven't done anything in in 10 years now. You don't think there",

You don't think there would have been more problems since 911 before 9911 if these people weren't there to check you down, pat you down, put you through the back scatter machine? No, because I think, uh, I think people ignore the fact that, you know, if if Al-Qaeda for instance is the real threat, then why are they going to do the same thing they just did? Everyone's aware, self aware of it now. Think about, think about this, Greg. Okay. I'm thinking when when a plane used to be hijacked, uhuh, back in, you know, in the day, back in the day, Orville rights hijacking a plane, not a Kitty Hawk pre 911 days, whatever, uh, they usually was done so that they could be, you know, uh, they can kind of trade the people off on the plane for money or concessions or whatever and that was the way it was. So everyone sat back and on 911 everyone learned",

So everyone sat back and on 911 everyone learned that, you know, now the new thing is you're going to hijack a plane and you're going to ram into the buildings and you don't care if you die and you don't care who you kill. So now people know better and they two would fight back. So I don't think that the hijacking of a plane ramming into a building thing would ever happen again because it's just impractical. If that's what they want to do, they'll do something else. That's kind of where I stand on that. Okay, well that's getting off the topic of the TSA. So even if you what if you just wanted to blow up the plane, make a mission, would you want somebody there checking for the bombs, checking for what's coming up? No, I mean, I have no problem. Think about again pre 911. You'walk through the X-ray machine, they would look into your bags and stuff like that.",

But I don't think that, uh, the TSA, you know, taking granny and putting her in the in the machine and looking at her naked and like going through her things and it's just, it's just a little strange to me and I I'm a little frustrated that people don't understand that it's really unconstitutional, it's really unnecessary. When someone at the TSA tells you you suspend your rights when you're in the airport , tell them they're full of ****. You never suspend your rights. They're an inalienable, they're an inalienable rights and, uh, they are suspended when you die basically. Yeah, so then you're fun to fly with. Yes, you know. Yeah, well tell me you have a good story about, uh, your family when they they tried to put you through this whole thing. You were going somewhere with your family, you got stopped in the",

You were going somewhere with your family, you got stopped in the airport, what happened? Are you talking about in Virginia? Yeah, I'm talking about in Virginia, the old Virginia story we call it. Right after 911, I went to Richmond to see my sisters, um, and I got into a big fight with, uh, the agents there that wanted to go through my bags and I refused to let them search my bags and I was in high school, I was in 12th grade, um, and not nose Punk. Yeah, did you already have the the Revolutionary War tattoos on your arms? No, that wasn't happening. I got those in college. Okay. Um, and so long long story short, Greg, uh, they wouldn't go through my bags, called some cops over, some local cops and they were, you know, we basically had a conversation and they actually let me through without searching my bags because I told them, you know, my story and that, you know, uh, I guess about my",

But that was the birth place in which every time I go to the airport, I give the TSA a hard time. I like how you're downplaying you're being rational now when we go to the airport, you walk in, you go time for some security theater and you just talk **** to these people they're making minimum wage trying to scrape by. See this is this is of the major problems I think with people giving them giving the TSA a free pass is, you know, they don't have to work at the TSA and what they're doing, uh, isn't a function that, you know, that of government that anyone needs and it's a job that you're basically paying for that they just annoy people, they just slow the process down, they make you throw your water out if you have",

Yeah, you know, the nun is walking through the machine, she's getting padded down, how bringing up the granny, the the old lady, this dude, that dude, this woman, it's like it's like it's just too much. It we don't want that kind of society like a it's turning into a police, the TSA is scary, it's SC it's scary stuff that you can't Flex, aren't they more laughable? That's what they are to me when I walk up and they want to take off my shoes and what kills me is that they never have the same rules airport to airport. Yes, and I've had I this one time I had my laptop and my iPad together like what do you separate them? So I separate them months later I was flying and a flight attendant was behind me she's like, oh, you can put your laptop and iPad together.",

Some people want them in lengthwise, some people want them in widthwise. They don't know. They're making it up as they go along. So here's a funny story for with the so I I always take the laptop cuz they see it but sometimes they want you to take the iPad out, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they want you to take, you know, they made me take a Wii out when I was traveling with a Wii. Don't ask me why I was playing a Wii, but they asked me to to take that out. But now I just leave everything in my bag except for the laptop and if they want to give me a hard time about it, that's fine. But I will tell you this, when I was in England, they didn't require any of the stuff. I went to take my shoes off and the woman's like, oh, you don't need to do that here. And I'm like, oh, I",

Oh, well in England it doesn't make one guy tried to blow up a shoe bomber, remember him? Yeah, so now everyone takes their shoes off. See this is the thing, the terrorists have already won, Greg, because we have something like that. This is what they wanted. This is what they wanted, you know, they want to instill a sense of fear and panic in people. People some people really think the TSA is keeping them safe. The TSA isn't keeping them safe . The TSA is stealing money from them. They're stealing money, they're making flights more expensive and they just bust your balls, you know, and these people don't have to work there and I don't feel bad for anyone that works at the TSA.

Oh, real quick too, what's your what's your favorite part of the security theater? Mine has to be that in San Francisco at SFO, they now ask you as they check your ID what your last name is. Is yeah, cuz I'm a terrorist and I've made it this far and I didn't read the ID crap. What is my last name? Uh, no, my favorite my my favorite instance is when we you and I went to Los Angeles not too long ago and, uh, I was giving the guy a hard time and I asked him how it was how it felt to infringe on my constitutional rights and then I walked out of the machine, you know, thing that whirls around around you and he's like he's like this is what you look like and it's just a picture that says okay on it.
