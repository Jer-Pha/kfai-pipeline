I'm Greg and this is my roommate Colin. Now sometimes Colin here he says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday we throw a new topic of conversation at him. He responds to him. He has no idea what is on my little cards here of conversations. He gets one every Tuesday, Thursday, gets to talk about it. Colin, are you ready? Yeah, right. If you're ready at home, like this video, share it with your friends, subscribe to our YouTube channel. Today's topic of conversation is the Electoral College. What's its deal, Colin? Like we all get to, we go vote and like but the world doesn't try, the America doesn't trust us enough to like count our own votes. I have to have some other guy go and do it. Yeah, I mean so the Electoral College uh is really an old idea and it makes perfect sense when you really think about it. Uh back after the Revolution was over and we were",

Uh back after the Revolution was over and we were drafting the Constitution in the late 1780s, of course smaller states had a concern that the bigger states would trounce them electorally if they had bigger population. So when you think about states like Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, the bigger states back then, yeah, they would dwarf electorally the states with smaller populations if it was just proportional based on on the electorate of those states. So a state like Georgia or Delaware or Maryland would just not have a voice but I so in order to balance that, yeah, they said you will vote for electors that will then cast a vote, you know, quote unquote uh at the national level and so the electoral votes would go um and count more for the smaller states. So a state like Delaware has three electoral votes, that's the fewest you can have",

So a state like Delaware has three electoral votes, that's the fewest you can have, two senators and a congressman and uh that would proportionately weigh higher against something like Pennsylvania than it would if you were just to count the votes uh by popular vote. So it makes perfect sense actually. It doesn't make any like it's one of those things we live in California and California can't agree on anything. Like I don't understand what what it's not like we're all a hive mind that we all have the same beliefs and values so that all of a sudden like one state would be the Democratic State and one would be a Republican state and I just realized how enthralling this conversation is for our international listeners but like isn't that an outdated idea now? I mean you live in San Francisco, you know everyone here has a bunch of batshit ideas they don't listen to each other",

Yeah, I mean I wouldn't use California as an example just because California is a complete disaster but when you but when you uh it's not about it's just it's just a wacky place. Yeah, but um think about it this way, even today think about a state like Wyoming. Wyoming has very few people like under ion and but they have certain things that must be dealt with at a federal level like for instance like ranching and farming and stuff like that, things that maybe the agriculture department will will have to deal with and stuff like that. But if you were just to take their electorate of maybe 100, 150,00 0 people that actually vote there and the needs of Wyoming would be drowned out by the millions and millions and millions of people that vote in California",

But if you give them three electoral votes even though California has many more than that, many many more than that, they still count a little bit higher. It gives them a little bit more of a voice so it makes the small states feel like they have something to say and I don't mean small states just geographically again, I mean small states by population because a bigger state popular you know Rhode Island is a good example of a state with a bigger population than you would think of the size of the state uh and Massachusetts is the same way. Vermont has no people. Wyoming has no people. The Dakotas have no people and those people wouldn't have a voice at the national level if that the Electoral College didn't exist at least in terms of presidential politics",

So I mean I guess it's it's down to two people when it comes to president every year. Yeah and is one going to be like well agriculture and the other guy's like I'm pro agriculture and then Wyoming is going to be like everybody you have to vote for the agriculture guy. Yeah, I'm that's just an example. I'm just saying that you know a state a state like Delaware was the first to ratify the Constitution because of something like the Electoral College because none of those states would have ratified the Constitution, those smaller states if we didn't have the Electoral College in place because they were afraid of being drowned out at the national level. So if you actually change your Electoral College by amendment you would have to kind of wonder if the Constitution in itself would have to be ratified",

So if you actually change your Electoral College by amendment you would have to kind of wonder if the Constitution in itself would have to be ratified again not because of any other reason but this is the way that a lot of states accepted the federal bond that we had after the Revolution and so it's not something that will easily be changed. It's something that will never be changed even though people a lot of people don't understand it and a lot of people don't like it. I think there's a rational realistic reason why it exists and I actually don't think it affects the big states at all. So people don't really need to worry about it. If you got rid of it the small states would suffer, the big states wouldn't suffer. The big states actually would have all the say. New York and California and Texas would basically dominate everything. H well they already do though. Not really. I mean I mean those states don't turn you know Texas always going to vote",

I mean I mean those states don't turn you know Texas always going to vote Republican and those states always vote Democrat but when you think about the sheer amount of people in those states and then you take everything in the middle of the country and put it into a ball and it has the same population as those three states that's problematic at a national level and it's not fair. Okay, well Colin, I think that about wraps up this conversation. If you enjoyed this conversation make sure you like the video, share it with your friends, subscribe to us here on YouTube, youtube.com/gameovergreggy then check back every Tuesday and Thursday where I will shove a new topic into Colin's head and we'll see what he says about it. Until then I hope you have a conversational day",
