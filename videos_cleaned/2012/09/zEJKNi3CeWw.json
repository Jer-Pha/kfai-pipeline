All right, no, why? Why is it the greatest show ever? Why is Seinfeld so great? Why can we watch Seinfeld like we do three times a night every weekday and still love it? I think I think it has to do with things that we can we can you know quantify and also things that are intangible. I think that the four main actors on Seinfeld are perfectly cast, really funny together and really funny individually and you care about them and you kind of are your they're endearing. My George is my favorite character in any fiction ever like of",

My George is my favorite character in any fiction ever like of any kind of fiction and George is an **** and like you shouldn't like him, like he's conniving and he manipulates people and he's like lazy and slav and Lee and stuff trying to get with Marisa Tomei even though he's engaged. Yeah, like he is an amazing character and and I absolutely adore that character. I think Seinfeld has managed to do something that few shows is not managed. I think I Love Lucy and All In The Family are two really good examples of shows like it and that even though it takes place in the space and time, you know, I Love Lucy was very 50s family-centric, very family-friendly and All In The Family was like very like Vietnam War era like Archie Bunker's or Republican **** and like meathead is like you know this like this liberal that you know and they should get along but you like",

Now it's interesting that first off sign bills still relevant I think is it just because they're piggybacking off topics that'll always be there you know sex love friendship stuff like that is that the key to a good show or you keep saying relevant for so long maybe I mean I I don't I'm not gonna pretend that I know what makes a show how",

I also think it's the show about nothing mentality about like how you can appreciate them in yuusha of the things that they they talk about me give you an example sure in the first season one of the very first episodes is the Chinese restaurant and that episode is the epitome of a show about nothing that show is about nothing it is about them waiting for a table at a Chinese restaurant and what is so ingenious about that is that everyone's been there everyone has seen the dude come in and he clearly came in after you and he gets table first everyone's been talking to the the you know to the the guy at the",
