I'm Greg and this is my roommate Colin. Now every so often Colin says something crazy so every Tuesday and Thursday we reach into my topic pile, toss one at him, have a conversation about it. If you like the idea of this show, like the video, share it with your friends, then subscribe to us here on YouTube. Colin, are you ready? Yes. All right, today's topic of conversation is hockey goons. Now this is a fascinating little thing. I didn't know anything. There are players on hockey teams that sole purpose is to punch people in the face. Yes, although it's a diminishing role today, but yeah. All right, well talk talk to me a little about the hockey goon and what all this means. Um so uh the hockey go on also know known as the enforcer um was typically for many years up until somewhat recently maybe like right around the lockout in 2004, 2005 uh the Dark Ages, the",

It was very tragic. Oh my God, the nation almost never recovered. The the goon was uh or the enforcer was basically designed to play only a few minutes a game um and he was basically there to make sure that there was someone that could kind of deal retribution to the other team if say one of their star players was the victimized by a dirty hit or the other team's enforcer wanted to kind of throw down to kind of get everyone's energy level up or things of this nature. So um it was a very specific uh unskilled position on a hockey team that has kind of uh evolved into something else more recently. What has it evolved into now? Um more recently there's no there's no roster room really for a player like that anymore. Like now like a fourth line",

Like now like a fourth line center, fourth line defenseman or whatever that needs to uh throw down every once in a while also needs to kind of contribute offensively. He needs to have a solid plus minus rating. He needs to uh be able to move the puck. He needs to have skating skills. Um so the game is not played quite the same way it was in the 70s , 80s and 90s as it is today. It's a faster game and so um the goon has kind of been shunned by some teams including my own, the New York Islanders of course. All right, but so they're not calling people up from the miners to fight . Is hockey getting too civilized for your tastes? No, I mean I I I I understand why people don't like fighting in hockey and I understand that I understand that most people an interesting thing. Well I I I I like it and I also understand why it exists. Um it's",

Um it's let me put it this way like in this if you go on YouTube you're on YouTube right now actually yeah but don't click off yet unless you've already liked, shared it with your friends and subscribe uh but you can find plenty of of of line brawls and plenty of bench clearing brawls from back in the day um and a lot of hockey players back then just had a a a mental and physical toughness um where they can kind of take care of themselves and then that kind of evolved into something that was more uh assigned to a few role players on the team that would take care of the fighting. So um a player like Marty McSorley on the Kings defended Wayne Gretzky and Wayne Gretzky wouldn't do his dirty work. Wayne Gretzky did fight every once in a while um not very often at all did he fight? Well no yeah exactly pretty boy but",

Well no yeah exactly pretty boy but like if someone took a shot at Wayne Gretzky, Marty McSorley would punch you in your face. So it kind of made you think twice about what you were doing and those players still exist and actually when the Islanders played the Penguins two years ago and it was the third most penalized game in NHL history that was when the Islanders had brought up all of their like a couple of their goons including Michael Haley who recently signed with the Rangers unfortunately uh they called him up in order to fight um and that was because the game previous uh the Penguins go the Penguins go and a game and the Islanders ended up winning big in that game and also getting on penalties so it's a fighting and goonery in hockey is about cadence, cadence and it's about energy um it's about uh ebbs and flows which is really",

So how does it still exist period? Like why is there still fighting in hockey? Is it always going to be this way? I think it is. I think there's a conflict. I think that the hardcore hockey fans understand why fighting is in the game and so they like it and you say it's there because of ebbs and flows to bring up uh you take retribution on people who are you know going after your star players to if you're like in a slump to get you guys riled back right? If you let up a weak goal for instance the team's down you're at home the crowd's not into it the players aren't into it you send your goon out maybe the other team sends their goon out pushing and shoving happens they start fighting the crowd's into it maybe a huge punch is landed",

So is this in a way like professional wrestling of a way like I I'm the Islanders and you're some other team I only know one team in the NHL and I send out my goon and like you see my goon so you send your goon out knowing this is about to happen yeah I mean a lot of times so it's just totally orchestrated yeah sometimes because well in that Penguins Islanders game for instance the Islanders refined $100,000 for clearly premeditating the entire thing because Haley fought like almost everyone like he tried to fight the goalie he tried to fight this guy",

It is funny if if I've if by this point in A Conversation With Colin I've gotten good enough at editing I will be linking to it right around here. Oh so so just consider that hockey has a fighting rather has a place in hockey and the hardcore fans understand it but it turns off people that don't understand hockey but it might be into hockey and they're watching it and it's a great game it's fast it's back and forth it's high scoring which I don't like high scoring hockey but a lot of people do and then suddenly dudes are fighting and they're like why are these guys just fighting and why are the referees just standing there yeah and letting it",

It's well it's because it's allowed and there's a place for it and you saw in the playoffs because we watched some of the playoffs together how when a team plays each other six, seven times in a row in a series how ugly those series gets and how people just fight over and over again and it gets really gritty and really emotional because hockey is a really emotional sport and fighting is kind of one of the conduits by which the emotion is led out and it has real repercussions like I've said in the game. So I don't think it's going to go anywhere but I don't think the NHL itself that the office like that the front office likes fighting anymore because uh it turns off the casual fans that they need to grow the sport and so I think you're going to see more penalties I think you're",

Who's the best goon of all time? That's tough. I really like Rob Ray. Um I think uh Tie Domi is one of the greats because he was small and scrappy um and you can find plenty of footage again on YouTube of him um taunting fans and going crazy. I think he actually went into the crowd and fought a fan once and you you find that took off his skate tried to murder him. I actually think what happened was a dude was taunting him and like leaning on the glass in The Penalty Box and the glass collapsed and broke",

That's my kind of hockey yeah but there are there are great goons in in NHL history great. Well Colin I think that about covers this conversation.
