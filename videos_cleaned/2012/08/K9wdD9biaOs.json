Maverick, thank you so much for your letter, but let's get this out on the table right away. Knock it off. Why are you getting all choked up and sad? That gets me all choked up and sad. Like I was saying in the blog, I'm not upset at all about having cancer, being, you know, Hod gkin lymphoma, totally curable. Y y y, that doesn't get me down anymore. But when I have to tell somebody, I see them start tearing up. I see, you know, somebody start crying when I talk to him, that's what it is. I'm going to be fine. I got to wait till Infamous 3 is out. I got to beat Colin and platinum trophies. I got a lot of stuff to get done before I decide to go to the big PlayStation arcade in the sky. All right, so let's get that out of way. That's fine. Secondly, the best wings in the country are in Ohio. I don't think so, sir. Everyone knows it's CJ's in Columbia, Missouri, right there. They got little tiger. They're down there, uh, 704 East Broadway.",

They're down there, uh, 704 East Broadway in Columbia, Missouri. But here's the problem. Obviously, Ohio, I was like, I I I got big for my bridges here for a second, Maverick. I looked at your video, got really got real choked up, felt, you know, the connection we have, said, you know what? I'm going to say, I'm going to say when I get better, when I'm I'm going to go to Ohio. Then I rethought that cuz I don't want to go to Ohio to meet a stranger and stay in his house for a week and not know what's going on. So here's what it is, Maverick. Knock on wood, I'm going to be fine. I'll be on a chemo regimen. I'll know what's going on. I'll be going to New York Comic Con with one Colin War already. New York, not terribly far from Ohio. You should come there. We should meet there, eat some wings in New York. They they're pretty good at Wings is what I hear. But if",

You don't have to feel weird. I don't know how your wife took it when you started getting choked up and had to go outside cuz some fat guy in the internet's got cancer. I understand it. You understand it. Anyone watching this who cares about IGN understands it. You guys mean the world to me. It's one of those things like the you know, the outpouring of love and support has been ridiculous. I'll never be able to respond to everybody. I'll never be able to repay somebody, but you know, I wanted to make sure I got back to you you through this trouble making a video and putting it up there on the YouTube.

I didn't show your V yes, you asked me to show your video, you know, oh, you show this to Colin and Ryan and then you told them if I if I start to quit or something, I off man, I'm not going to quit. No, Greg Miller doesn't know how to quit except exercise. That's the only thing he knows how to quit. He gets out of that as soon as it starts. But you think I'm going to quit like cancer? Like I said, Infamous 3, I got to be around for. I got to beat Colin trophies. I got to eat more chicken wings. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to lose my positivity.
