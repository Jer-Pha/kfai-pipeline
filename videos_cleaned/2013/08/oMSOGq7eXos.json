            "text": "Welcome to Horribly Wrong Comic Book Origins where a non-comic fan takes a crack at a classic comic tale. Today's origin is Batman. Well when Stan Lee created Batman, Greg, I don't know if you knew, when Stan Lee created Batman he was reading the Old Testament a lot. Specifically he was reading the Pentateuch, which is the first five books of the Old Testament, and he wanted to create a comic book that kind of was an ode to specifically the story of Moses. Now, Greg, I don't know how much of the Old Testament you know, but... I've read some of it, I know a bit about it. But the story of Moses as a baby is that he's put on the River Nile in a basket and the Egyptians find him, right? Something of this nature. You don't even know, how can you be so detached from pop culture that you don't know Batman's origin? Well, I'm going to tell you why Stan Lee invented Batman if you just give me a minute, Greg. So Batman is created as an ode to the Old Testament and so Stan Lee created these other",

So Batman is created as an ode to the Old Testament and so Stan Lee created these other characters as his parents, right? And we don't know the names of the parents. We don't know anything about... We don't know the names of Batman's parents. No, the names of the parents that we don't know. You're right, not important to this story at all. We don't know them at all. They're just an everyday couple and they're walking through Gotham City, Greg. And they're carrying... You got one thing right, at least. They're carrying Batman, a little baby Batman, in a basket. But we don't know their names or his name? No, we don't know anything about the names of any of these characters. So Batman's being kind of carried through, they're kind of walking around the city, you know, having a great time. They're gunned down, Greg, tragically gunned down.

Tragically gunned down in front of their baby in a bassinet. Right, exactly. Okay, great. Exactly, good word. Just making sure I'm caught up. So they're gunned down. Now the criminals aren't hard enough that they kill the young baby who we never know... We never know the name of the parents or the baby. I'm sick of these weak ass criminals not killing babies. That's what I want to put a pin in right here. So what ends up happening, Greg, this is what's really weird. The cops come, they take the parents'bodies away, but the basket is missing. They never see the baby and that's because this is where a bum comes in, a Gotham City bum. His name is Freddy Fingers. Freddy Fingers, okay. Freddy Fingers takes the baby, right, and for a few days he thinks he can take care of this baby, but he realizes he can't take care of himself. Now this",

Now this is where the story of Moses really comes into play. This is where Stan Lee really got the inspiration into the story of Batman. He drops the basket into a river, right? He's like, I can't take care of this baby. He drops the basket into the river and the river kind of takes it upstream. There's a mansion upriver run by a family known as the Waynes, right? And Alfred, who is the butler of this mansion, he's out there doing the laundry in the river. Now they don't need to do this. They have washing machines, but they're a very rustic family. They're nouveau riche. I don't know if you knew that. Okay, I see. You got that washboard thing where he's doing this thing? And he sees this baby kind of coming by and he's like, what the fuck is this? So he goes and grabs the baby out of the basket and",

And Bruce Wayne comes up, not as a superhero, he's a normal dude, but they have such means and such money and he was such a good son to them. Not knowing that this ever happened to his parents. He never knows that this happened. That he grows up and takes over this company called Wayne Enterprises and becomes Batman. No, no, no. You're not allowed to. No, you're not allowed to. Why the fuck does he become Batman? Well, this is the part that's really interesting. Oh good, I've been waiting for this. I don't know. A lot of people were always confused about why they call him the Batman. Sure. And the reason is because there were a few other Batmen out there. In the 40s and 50s there were a few other Batmen, but he calls",

In the 40s and 50s there were a few other Batmen, but he calls himself the Batman because he wants to specifically test the weapons that Bruce Wayne or that the Wayne Enterprises are creating or whatever. Now this is initially kind of a scientific pursuit for him, but eventually he realizes that he's actually doing a lot of good for a city overrun by crime. Ironically never knowing that his parents were the victims of this. That's very sad. That's like a Greek tragedy right there. And that's the origin story of Batman. I was with you that there were other Batmen and he wanted to be the Batman until you said he wanted to be the Batman to test Wayne weapons. Yeah. Greg, we only have a few minutes.

Stan Lee made most of the Marvel guys that you talk about in the show and know nothing about. Bruce Wayne, not in a basket, knew his parents pretty well. Thomas and Martha killed in front of him outside of the theater. Goes on to avenge their deaths, stop crime, make sure no one ever has to live through that kind of pain again. Nah, I don't think so .
