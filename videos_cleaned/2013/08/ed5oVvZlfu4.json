It's me, Greg, welcome to another episode of Gregway where every Wednesday and Friday I answer one of your questions whether it be from video responses , the comments on these YouTube videos, whatever the hell, however are you the Twitter, the Twitter, that's what they call the other one, tweet at me, follow me on Twitter. Today's question comes from Nick. Let's see what he has to say. Good morning, Greg Miller, great Gregway as usual. Great, you're giving me a lot of credit saying it's a great Gregway already. I mean all we've done is said hello. I actually screwed up the Twitter thing. I didn't say Twitter right, but I'm you're grading on a curve, I'm sure. Thank you very much. What, let's get to your question. The other night I was out having some wings with some friends, good work team fat , team bone, and I thought to myself, self, when did Greg Miller become so interested in Wings? What was his first Wing experience that made him want them so bad? So my question to you is what was your first",

So my question to you is what was your first encounter with wings that made you love them oh so very much? You're making me think back here. When was, what was the exper, I mean like the thing is it all evolved at the same time. I think the experience, right, was college. The seed was planted back in high school, of course. I was growing up in the suburbs of Chicago where I was originally from and uh me and my friends, you know, you're in high school, at least when I was growing up here in the you know the late 90s, 0210 All That Jazz, uh you didn't go out that much for like, hey, let's go out to dinner tonight to your friends, right? Spend all day with them at school or whatever projects you're having, then you go home, you eat with your parents and you try to conv them and take you out or something.

Eventually my mom took me out to Lonar Steakhouse where I had wings there and they were delicious. These Wings were amazing. I came home, I told my best friend about it. I was like, dude, These Wings were great. He like, well sometime we have to go out and take our other friends out for wings. And I said, this is a great idea. We actually went out, we had wings, we agree this was great. Like we went into this Steakhouse and all we ordered was wings and all the you know minimum wage people there very upset that the there was a table full of like six guys and all they wanted were appetizers. Get a better job. But then you figure I graduate high school, right, on the 18-year-old person. I go to college, University of Missouri, there it is, this shirt, this shirt, look at that, this shirt's over 10 years old. Go anyways, I go to the University of Missouri, Mizzou as they call",

You have all this all this freedom, you can do whatever you want, you do whatever the hell you want. And what I chose to do was eat really terribly and it turned out that when I went to Mizzou this was also the opening of this shop called Wing Zone which would deliver Wings, chicken wings of all sorts of varieties and flavors to you in the dorms or wherever you were. They were, you know, it was delivery would bring you food, you know how delivery works. You know, some people get into excessive drinking and partying. I did both of those things, but I joined this group called the Antlers which kind of were about both of those things and I was lucky enough to join them when they were really the Antlers.

They embraced team fat, they embraced chicken wings. So we'd eat chicken wings together there, but then even on my own at the dorms, right, I got into this this rigma roll , this uh rotation where I was ordering Wing Zone with Reckless abandon. Most, I mean like I'm this is not an exaggeration, most most of the time every other day I would order wings, Wing Zone to be delivered to me and then just destroy a thing of hot garlic wings while watching Monday Night Raw or whatever then would be on Wednesday or hanging out with my friends or coming back from a night out or whatever and I when Wing Zone would bring you the order they'd give you magnets, right? And so I'd start putting them on my little uh like heater there. So I had this heater filled with magnets, but they didn't come every time and this is when I knew there there was something going",

I like said hello pretty much and she's like, oh hey Greg and I was like, oh wow, like I didn't know her name. She's like knew my name. She's like, you want the hot garlic again? I'm like, yeah, I do. She's like, you should try something else, you know, we do other wings and we like went back and forth, we're flirting blah blah blah, but all I wanted was the wings. I didn't want I didn't want a relationship , right? I'm a freshman at Mizzou, I have blue hair, just give me the wings. So eventually though in this conversation I bring up the fact that you know how many times have I ordered and like it's again that was 2001 years ago, I don't remember anymore, but she ran the order count on my or on my like you know telephone number and this",

I mean like not even I was still in 2001, right? And it was something like 40, 45 orders. I remember it was below 50, but it was still up there and I said, well, you know, for the record, I only have 22 magnets and so the order came that night and I got it and I opened up she'given me the magnets I was owed and wrote me a message on the box of like for real try another FL flavor and I said, that's adorable and then I ate these wings and never spoke to that girl again. But the other dope Wing Zone story, right, was the fact that this one time we were in another dorm and somebody else ordered from their dorm room phone and I told them this story while they were coming of like how much I order from Wing Zone and this magnet story and that I was this big deal at Wing Zone and they're",

Like no one could eat that many wings. Why would somebody waste their money like that? These people they don't know you, they would never give you extra magnets. And so we went downstairs to get the the delivery and my friend grabs the wings and he goes, oh and by the way, do you know a guy named Greg Miller and this **** computer, do you know a guy named Greg Miller? And literally the delivery driver goes, yes, everyone knows from Greg Miller, he orders from us every night and that was probably one of the proudest moments of my life. Now of course this wing story, this whole Wing question I'm sure sprouted out of the ground because people were I I put up that Wing video the other day where I was berting someone for putting in a video response asking me what my",

Clearly it's wings. It's in the Twitter. You do all this stuff. I'm always promoting that CJ's down in Columbia, Missouri, go there, eat some wings if you have the chance. Even the water tastes better out of CJ's coat. So yeah, college is really where the wing Obsession began because basically there was no one there to tell me no you can't eat chicken wings every other day or in many occasions every day. Uh I brought that back. I'll never forget you know the summer between my freshman and sophomore years I came back and of course while I was in Missouri uh there was this new thing called Buffalo Wild Wings that we had never heard of before and it had started there and we discovered one like 45 minutes from our Chicago suburb. So again we went back for this summer and me and my",

So again we went back for this summer and me and my friends drove there literally twice a week, three times a week and we couldn't drink obviously we just went there to eat wings and be disgusting and then come home and play NCAA Football on the PlayStation 2. I guess actually would have been Madden, right, that first year on PlayStation 2 and then that summer oh because it's summer oh there you go that's why it checks out in my head it got there in the end. So that's where the obsession began. Like I've said a million times before now it's just mutated in a full-blown thing with of course my love of CJ's in Columbia, Missouri, a great local joint go there if you're ever in Columbia for wings. If you're ever in San Francisco go to Wing Wings, WI Wings SF on Twitter go there all the time they are just dynamite oh my God and lower eight but as if this",

It comes from the Harlot. He says please review this buffalo wing soda since I can't get it near me and Beyond the the wing soda he's talking about here is Lester's Fixins buffalo wing soda. It sounds disgusting. This is one that Greg Atlas uh IGN Super Fan had brought in for me at an Up At Noon once and wanted me to do something with it. I think I was sick and had cancer. I didn't get the chance. Now we're actually going to do it though. Never had it before. I do like wings. Never been a big fan of soda. Oh also if you're in Columbia, Missouri ever Shakespeare's Pizza okay let's see how this thing goes.
