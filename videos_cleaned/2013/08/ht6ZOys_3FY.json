            "text": "Welcome to Horribly Wrong Comic Book Origins where a non-comic fan takes a crack at a classic comic tale. Today's origin is Blue Beetle. Alright well the story of Blue Beetle is kind of a strange one. We're talking about the origin story of a guy named Frederic LaPierre. Do you know anything about Frederic? I don't know Frederic LaPierre but I would like to put on the table that I'm not offended you don't know the Blue Beetle story before you go down your rabbit hole in the grave. I don't know why you're assuming that I don't know because I'm about to tell it to you. So Frederic LaPierre is an entomologist and he's really into the study of insects obviously but specifically he's into the study of beetles right? This is his thing. He works at the University of Colorado he's a professor there . This is his thing and he's specifically interested in figuring out how the exoskeleton of the beetle is developed. The exoskeleton of the beetle is really important. People usually focus on",

People usually focus on the pincers. That's really not very important. Your body can take so much punishment. It helps us out in war and stuff. That's exactly right. If we fast forward we know that the Blue Beetle ends up being the main antagonist in Green Lantern. You know Green Lantern is the blind guy who's really fast. The blind guy who's really fast? Yeah. Okay. I didn't know that about Green Lantern. That's an interesting one. It's what happens in between that's really important. So LaPierre is obsessed with these beetles. He's doing some genetic experiments and some of these academic exercises to figure things out. He ends up becoming obsessed with this specific beetle. The blue one? The Blue Beetle. The Blue Beetle exactly. Now this Blue Beetle shouldn't be blue, Greg. This is the weird thing about him. He",

This is the weird thing about him. He shouldn't be blue. It's kind of like an albino kind of thing going on. Okay, sure. He's obsessed with it. He draws the genes out of it and injects it into his own body. What he doesn't realize at this point is that this is really mildly offensive to other scientists around him. That he's kind of experimenting with genetics and the genome and injecting it himself and he's expelled from academia at this point. And it's at this point that the Blue Beetle kind of comes into being because like many super villains in comic book history he becomes extremely angry because what he had he no longer has. He's no longer getting paid by the University of Colorado. He's no longer in academia. He's no longer a professor. And it's at this time that the genetics slowly happen. See , Greg, in comic books a lot",

See, Greg, in comic books a lot of the times things seem to happen really quickly, right? Like when Spider-Man is bitten by the spider that his dad gave him. The terrarium, yeah. And he went back into the terrarium. This happened really quickly. He got the powers really quickly. It took years for the Blue Beetle to get his powers and what his powers ended up being of course was the exoskeleton that he ironically was obsessed with when he was a professor. Now this drove him crazy for two reasons, Greg. One, it reminded him of being a professor at the University of Colorado and he's no longer able to study academics and this makes him really angry but it also makes him able to kind of withstand gunshots and all sorts of fodder. Grape shot is a war if he was being shot by old 17th century ship guns for instance and things of",

His Captain time travel was showing up all the time with his ship. Right. Like future ship that could then shoot him with the. Well this is also where Calendar Man comes in but we're not going to talk about Calendar Man right now. So the ironic thing about Blue Beetle is that he's only able to withstand things defensively as actually absolutely no offensive weapons. But the cool thing about Green Lantern who's blind and can't see is that. But he runs real fast. He moves real fast. He's super fast. Is that he doesn't have any offensive weapons either so he's constantly just running around and Blue Beetle's constantly just in a shell and this is why no one cares about Green Lantern. Okay, wow, there's a lot to unpack on that one. Blue Beetle such a minor",

Blue Beetle such a minor character of course I could only find this cover. There he is. Yeah, that's right. He's a normal sized man. Well, there's been three Blue Beetles and I'll admit that Blue Beetle's story is a bit like something you would think up that's a bit crazy. It starts with this guy Dan Garrett. He's an archaeologist. He goes out and finds a Blue Beetle Scarab that gives him these powers, right, that he has like you're talking about he can't get hurt and stuff like that. He has a guy who's his assistant named Ted Kord. Ted Kord sees him turn into the Blue Beetle, realizes he's the Blue Beetle. Blue Beetle gets killed. Kord picks up the Scarab but it doesn't give him powers so he's just an inventor who has all these really cool inventions and stuff that he can then go use and he takes on the mantle Blue",

He gets killed eventually though and then the Scarab gets found by this little boy or like teenage boy named Jaime Reyes. He gets it and he gets to be this Blue Beetle guy there and run around. Blue Beetle's not really all that interesting but his story is crazy enough that I thought your crazy story would be good too. Thanks for watching. Click here to watch Deadpool's origin .
