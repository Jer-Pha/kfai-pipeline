Maybe Oswald was just **** crazy and knew the president was coming to Dallas and went into the School Book Depository and took his sniper rifle because he was, by the way, Army trained and killed the president. I mean, maybe, maybe that's the way. But like, really, is that really it ? You know, like, I don't, I don't think so. I don't think that really is it. What's up , everybody? Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg and this is my roommate, Colin. Now, sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull it up, toss it at him, and we talk it out for your amusement. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to our channel, share it with your friends. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is the Kennedy assassination, submitted by ShutUpBender. Uh, who killed John F. Kennedy? Who killed John F. Kennedy? Oswald killed John F. Kennedy. Was, did he act alone? No, I don't think so. Oh, all right, who'd he act with?",

Oh, all right, who'd he act with? So this is, give me, you, you are Mr. American history. Yeah. So, all right, so I always describe the JFK situation in'63 as a conspiracy theory with weight. Like, there's something about that that is not as crazy as the moon landing conspiracies or other **** like that, like that are just **** left field ****. You know, like, there's more to this story than what we know. Absolutely. Like, here's what gives it up. There are two things that give this up, right? Yeah. Oswald himself lived in the Soviet Union for five years, right? He was like allowed there. Like, the Soviets were spying on him. They knew he was American and he left. So there's like some sort of Soviet connection, right? On one hand, we don't really know like what that amounts to other than like an ideological thing where he maybe",

On one hand, we don't really know like what that amounts to other than like an ideological thing where he maybe just didn't agree with like a Republican, little r, Republican form of government. The other side is that Jack Ruby killed Oswald, right? Totally weird , right? Ran up on him and shot him. Now, this is the, this is the thing, this is the weird thing. Like, if that never happened and Oswald in perpetuity was in prison, yeah, then, or he would have been, he would have been, he would have been executed. Um, that's a different story, right? It's just that why did Ruby kill him? Yeah. If, if there was nothing more to it, like, so Ruby has, this is, yeah, yeah. So that's where things get really complicated. Like, Ruby has ties to the mob. He's like a low-level mobster. Who sent him to kill Oswald and why? Because why would he do it? Yeah. Also, like, Ruby did start to talk about stuff like this and then didn't anymore. Like, like when he",

Also, like, Ruby did start to talk about stuff like this and then didn't anymore. Like, like when he first arrested, like, he was kind of letting things go a little bit and then kind of clammed up, clammed up. Um, I don't think he died in prison. Um, there's just like, I, there's like so many different conspiracy theories are really funny. Um, I mean, first of all, I think it's pretty clear that there was maybe a second shooter. Um , depending on who you listen to, back to the left, back and to the left. Um, so there's something about that as well. Like, Oswald has no motive and unfortunately because Ruby killed him and created all this intrigue, we don't know what, Oswell never even got a chance to talk. In fact, like, he never even pled guilty. He claimed that he never did it and that like, there's something, I don't, I hate to say it like this, but there's something sad about this story because like when you",

Then Ruby kills him on camera. Yeah, yeah, and this just begs a million questions . It just like, it, it unraveled. It's not like when McKinley was killed by an anarchist or like, you know, and Teddy Roosevelt became president or like other assassination attempts, like you could have a conspiracy theory about 1865 when when Lincoln is killed by Booth and like Booth is kind of like a Confederate sympathizer and like a Southp rise again kind of dude and like there's like kind of obvious ties there.

There's just many complications. What do you think about the JFK assassination? That just, it just doesn't add up. There's something about it like, like, and people think that LBJ was involved in it too and that's totally possible. Like, the connection would be from LBJ through the mob to kill JFK so he could become president. But is that, is that, is that the thing? You know, I don't know. Like, it, it's not something you learn, like I studied American history. It's not something you learn about in college. They don't talk about it. No, they don't want you to know the secrets, the truth. No, because like it's considered pseudo science almost. Like, it's, but like I just don't think it is. You know, it's not like aliens built the pyramids or something like that. It's not like, it's not as far fetched as people think it is. So I don't know. I",

If I, if I, if I was to be a betting man, like JFK had like really seedy connections, right? Sure. He was like having a pretty open affair with Marilyn Monroe, right? Um, he obviously had mob connections, deep mob connections that helped him get El, how was those obvious? I don't, I didn't know about this because of the just the way the electoral machine worked at that time. Like, you needed to make promises and connections to different people in different places and including in Chicago, of course. So, you know, he might have made promises he couldn't keep with the mob at which point they hire a Soviet sympathizer in Oswald that assassinates JFK maybe with the help of second shooter on the grassy knoll, right?

And then when they're afraid that it went through and he's going to talk, they send Ruby who's like a hack to go kill him. I mean, that's the most obvious connection, right? And then Ruby is probably being threatened inside to not say anything because obviously, obviously the reach is great. Yeah, family worried about you got kids on the outside, get a wife. I mean, that's, that's kind of the way. I don't, I'm not sure LBJ is involved in this. Like, I, I don't see why he would be involved in it. I understand that he, you know, this is post FDR so there's already a constitution that he can't run more than twice. JFK is young and vibrant and and new and Catholic and and you know, like really getting things done although he's kind of like not really a very good president and you know, he almost like he, JFK is responsible for",

So like I don't know how history would look back, that's what's most fascinating actually is how history would look back on JFK if he didn't die, if he didn't die. Yeah. Um because we know that like link, we look back on Lincoln very fondly regardless of if he was assassinated or not and the only thing we want to know like what could he be accomplished if he didn't get assassinated with with JFK we're pretty pretty average president but at the time like he was so new and different and handsome and everyone loved him that you know what happened with him and what happened with Bobby Kennedy in 1968 created this Mystique around them.

I mean maybe maybe that's the way but like really is that really it you know like I don't I don't think I don't think so I don't think that really is it. That's it. That's all I have to say.
