            "text": "Welcome to Horribly Wrong Comic Book Origins where a non-comic fan takes a crack at a classic comic tale. Today's origin is Deadpool. All right, so the story of Deadpool is really two different stories that happen about two decades apart. Greg, I don't know, two different stories two decades apart. Let's get all right, so uh, Deadpool's name is uh, Daniel Grimwald. Dan was born in the late 1920s during the height of the Depression and he ends up joining, you know, when he turns 17, he obviously lied like a lot of people did and joins the Army in order to fight the Nazis, right, in Europe. And uh, much to his dismay, he doesn't get sent to the European theater, he gets sent to the Pacific. And the Pacific, of course, Greg, if you know your history as I do, and you know I do, that you know that the Pacific was a much more dangerous theater, fighting a much more dangerous foe in the Japanese. Um, so, so Grimwald rises to the rank of lieutenant. He's kind of island hopping. He ends up on Saipan and, you know, what happens there, Greg? Comic to",

He ends up on Saipan and, you know, what happens there, Greg? Comic to telling jokes in the Pacific theater, more on that later. I'm sorry, I don't jump ahead. Grimwald is, you know, Japanese kind of taking whatever and they end up trusting him. Now, of course, Greg, as you know, uh, officers in the Japanese army would carry around katanas, right? They really didn't use them, but at this point in World War I, but they carried them around with them and they ended up kind of teaching, they were getting drunk over some sake and they ended up teaching him how to use a katana. Now he kind of takes skill, uh, and learns whatever and basically in 1945, the Allies when they liberate this camp , so that's, that's one part, part of story. Now we're another decade later, Grimwald is from Cincinnati, oh, and so he goes back to Cincinnati and gets a job, you know, normal office job. Actually, this is important story, but uses the GI Bill to go back to",

Actually, this is important story, but uses the GI Bill to go back to college. I like that all of your origin stories involve people going to college. Stay 50. Daniel comes through, he wants to be a standup comic, really funny, right? He's funny. His tells you on stage, really great. It's laury. They make a good buck. Who's on first? All these things. The thing about that is he has a nice, he has a nice way about him. He's not a very good standup comic and this makes him angry. Why was he so successful in the Japanese camp? Because he had a nice way about him. He wasn't funny in the Japanese had no idea what he was having was vibes. Cincinnati job, he's a standup comic, he's a fail standup comic. He washes out this point that he gets really upset, but he doesn't have an evil way about as you know, Deadpool not like a bad person. So he kind of combines the things that he loves and knows one that he's",

So he kind of combines the things that he loves and knows one that he's really good at, one that he's not so good at. And this kind of plays out of course in the new Deadpool video game that we saw constantly making wise cracks all the time. So he, the master works, the Deadpool video game. Now this is what's really important about the story is that when he leaves the Japanese camp, the prison camp 194, he sacks out katana from one of the officers and he goes, he's seen it while he goes his Cincinnati, oh, and he grabs katana and he starts of you know, long story short, Greg, basically he starts running around Cincinnati, Cincinnati goes around more places telling jokes, kind of wielding the sword, kind of fighting crime. He kind of your typical kind of kind of superhero with a little bit of a comedic slant, but he's really not that funny and that's kind of the story about how he uses a katana and why",

You got the big part. Little off on of course, Deadpool, the Merc with a Mouth. He's this assassin trained killer, uh, started off this guy Wade Wilson, then got involved with that their Weapon X program, which gave him the ability to regenerate just like Wolverine, but the problem was that Wade Wilson had cancer. He had some cancer tumors on him, right? So when he got this power, the body kind of fought back and cancer scarred his entire body. So he looks like he's been like a burn victim underneath the outfit and so then he goes out now and he drove him crazy too. It screwed with his brain. So he's got all these voices in his head and he's kind of insane. He knows he's in a comic, breaks the fourth wall, talks to them often. So SS Sil and he actually is really funny",
