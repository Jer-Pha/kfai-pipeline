Today's topic of conversation is what if the British won the Revolutionary War, submitted by FPS Shark. What if the British won the Revolutionary War? Yeah, well, I mean , so he wants you to put on your alternate history cap here. Of course, everyone knows the British won. No, I'm sorry, the British lost the Revolutionary War in roughly 1776. No, they didn't lose in 1776.",

No, they didn't lose in 1776. When they lose, they signed the treaty in 1783. They lost really in 1781 at Yorktown. Okay, but they they signed this Treaty of Paris in 17 so that doesn't happen. None of that happens. The British win. They should have won. Colonies were they were underprepared. They were some they could they they could have won. I mean, that's that's the thing. They could have won. Why? Um, all right, so we're really going to get into the weeds here on this one. That's fine. That's what people tune in for. I don't care what my producers say. Where do I where do I where do I even begin? So I guess let's stick to it. Just what what if the British won? Yeah, but they couldn't have won unless certain things happened.

Um, no, I think we would have turned out to be a country more like Canada in the sense, you know, Canada is still affiliated with the United Kingdom. We invaded Canada in, you know, during the War of 1812 , but, um, that was after the revolution, obviously. But I think we would have been more of like that, like a maybe a protector or something like that. Like they're an independent country, but, you know, they're the Queen of England is still the queen of, um, so this all began the re do you know why the Revolutionary War, how the Revolutionary War really began?

Okay, the French and Indian War was fought and, um, you know, it was the it's the French and Indian War, but it's really the British versus, um, the French in the New World. And also it's called the Seven Years War in England in in Europe. And during this war, um, the British spent an an enormous amount of money, right, in in the New World to protect their colonial interests. And, and, uh, when the war was over, they were in debt, like a hu the British were in like huge debt. And this is where the taxation thing starts to come in because the because because the British thought that the the American colony should be taxed, um, which is where the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act and all these things come out in the 1760s to to maintain a military presence and in the New World and also to have paid for some of their own protection during the New World because the English thought that, you know, they should have to",

And, and, and the colonists thought that like, no, like this is actually in your vested interest to protect this because of our economy , whether it's, uh, sugar and com tobacco, um, and things of this nature, rum, um, some mild manufactured products, but not much. A lot of that stuff went they going to be manufactured such as lumber. Um, so that all began in earnest in the 1760 s. And by the 1770s, things really came to a head where like people that's where taxation with representation came from. But really the war was going to happen anyway. They were looking for reason to fight. And a lot of this comes from the fact that a lot of the people in the colonies were people that had already escaped European prosecution, whether it's or persecution, whether it's, um, in the form of",

So they really wanted nothing to do with them anyway. Now, the reason that the the when the Revolution began in 1775, the shot heard around the world, right? Uh, they were arguing, there was an argument AR it was it was normal colonists getting up in the red coat's face. Red Coats were backing off, but then one person shot and then they as alington and conquered the yeah. Um, and yeah, no one knows who shot. Yeah, but they started firing at each other. The British, uh, retreated. Um, they were getting like it's so it's kind of cool to envision it, right?

Like it just it's on like it's on now, you know, and they've been waiting for this for a long time like like especially in Massachusetts. Yeah. Um, so you know, fast forward to 1783, the war is over. But we got to that point because the British looked at the Revolution as a Civil War. And a lot of people don't know about like really think about it or know that is that the English look at the American Revolution as a civil war. We look at it as a political violent revolution. And a lot of people such as Edmund Burke, who is a famous, uh, 18th century English political philosopher and, uh, member of, um, government Parliament, uh, in England, uh, didn't want to fight and they didn't think that we should be they should be fighting their own countrymen, that we should just let them go.

And, uh, when the French got involved to stick it to the British because of what happened in the in the French Indian War, um, we saw that in the Patriot. Yes, of course. Um, and, uh, you know, so things of this nature, like it's just it's almost impossible to imagine the British having won. I mean, like what what if the British won? Like it's boring. The British would have wanted and that would have been the end of that, you know, like like but I mean, like what would like I don't I can't picture the country is so we're just another Canada. Is like New York still like skyscrapers and stuff you think or I don't know. I mean, it's hard to say like you you assume that's like what I've worried about",

New York New York was a huge British stronghold, um, during the Revolution. So it would have been a sort like so we're assuming we fought the Revolution and lost, right? Right. That's what FPS Shark is saying. So like, yeah, New York was like very loyalist and and would have been, you know, focused in terms of growth and stuff like that. Eventually the United States would have become its own country, but I don't I don't know like how you get to that point, you know? Do you think we would have expanded as quickly? Would we have San Francisco like this? No, probably not. I mean, you the West would have been wide open for other other, you know, countries to have taken advantage of.

So like everything would have would have happened differently. Like I don't think that the the I think I think the more interesting question is not what if the British won the revolution, but how would how how would that like have happened, you know? Because like I said, like if they wanted to spend the money, if they really wanted to fight us and like really want to take it to us, they were the best trained, best armed, most disciplined army in the entire world and they had, um, at their disposal enough money to hire Hessian mercenaries and like all sorts of, you know, really hardened, you know, soldiers.

The war like moved down to Connecticut and New York, the Battle of Long Island, Battle of Brooklyn, like all these things we were getting our asses beat. That's when the the, um, George Washington all those guys, you know, retreated, um, for that that famous winter in 1776, crossed the Delaware, killed the Hessians in their sleep, totally guerilla style, like not okay to do. Like that's the other thing is that we were willing to fight in a way that the British were not willing to fight. Like we broke all of the rules of war to fight and that that that is in the Patriot and that's true. Like the British wanted to meet us on a in columns",

Like the British wanted to meet us on a in columns on the battlefield. We had no interest in doing that, you know, like and when we did it, we lost cuz we're badasses, you know? So like what did we do? We cross the Delaware and we kill the Hans while they're sleeping, you know, dope. Like like that's like that's like not only does that scare them like they're all drunk. It's Christmas. They're not supposed to be fighting fight in the winter in In classical the war Theory like you don't fight like you don't fight during that time like it's like you take a break. This is when there were like really hard fast rules of War. We had nothing to do with that.

Yorktown, of course, that's in the Patriot too when I think I I'm pretty sure Mel Gibson stabs to do with an American flag poll and that and that I don't know if that ever happened that's that's based on fact. Also, there's a mall in Illinois called Yorktown. So thank you FPS Shark. That was a good conversation. That was kind of a rambling conversation, but well what you I mean you said you nailed it.
