            "text": "Welcome to Horribly Wrong Comic Book Origins where a non-comic fan takes a crack at a classic comic tale . Today's origin is Spider-Man. So I hold the story of Spider-Man near and dear to me because I'm from Long Island and it just so happens Greg that the story of Spider-Man actually begins on Long Island. Hey look at it you're getting something right alright. We're at least in the same geographical place the real story. So Greg the story of Spider-Man of course it actually starts with Parker Brothers. You know the company Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers? Yes. Okay the Monopoly guy the guy who made Monopoly. So there's a guy named Donald Parker right and he's kind of the business side of the Parker Brothers and he has this son Peter right? Yeah I'm listening. Now at this time we're talking about when Monopoly's kind of coming out and the Parker Brothers are kind of you know they're always working right? Always working. Donald is neglecting Peter . And by the way",

And by the way Donald's wife Margaret had died in a car accident in the 1930s. So Donald foists off Peter Parker his son to his aunt and uncle right? And you might know these as Aunt May and Uncle Ben. Now Aunt May and Uncle Ben live in Queens which is on Long Island and Uncle Ben had already become very famous and very rich from inventing instant rice. So he... Wow one family did all of this. Yeah the Parker... That's impressive. The Parkers are very prolific. Now of course Uncle Ben African American. So did he marry into the family or how did that all work out? I don't know. I don't know everything. I just wondered how that one worked out. So Peter grows up with Ben and Aunt May right? And Donald comes and visits every so often. Now Donald is like very business-like he's very busy so",

Now Donald is like very business-like he's very busy so Donald doesn't know his son very well and vice versa but at one time he visits Queens with a terrarium. And in the terrarium is a spider. And he's kind of giving this to his son being like you know I know you're really into science he's really into science. I don't know if you know Peter Parker's really into science. And so Peter Parker gets this terrarium from his dad and there's a spider in there and he starts to study and really get into it . But he gets a little too close to the spider the spider gets out and the spider bites Peter while he's at home sleeping. And it's at this point that the origin story of Spider-Man really kind of comes into play because Uncle Ben dies. I don't know if you know... Uncle Ben dies. He dies of natural causes. And this leaves Aunt May alone as a widow in",

And this leaves Aunt May alone as a widow in the house to kind of tend to a rebellious Peter Parker who now has these superpowers. So just a regular old spider bit him? Yeah just a spider. Just a normal dude. Danny Longlegs tarantula what are we dealing with? No I don't think it's a tarantula I don't know much about spiders I'm not a scientist. Stan Lee wasn't either so it's probably just left a little vague. This is where the origin story of course of Spider-Man comes from and it's at this point that the spider kind of comes back. The spider doesn't die. The spider comes back. He bit him and climbed back in the tarantula. This is the part I left out that's really important is that Peter doesn't know what bit him. He has this thing on his left forearm specifically. And he gets bit but he doesn't know exactly what happened. The",

And he gets bit but he doesn't know exactly what happened. The spider is smart enough and self-aware enough to get back into the cage and chill for a little while. Now it's at this point that Spider-Man and the spider have a sort of telepathic link with each other. Holy shit this is getting good. And it's at this point specifically that Spider-Man understands that he has to go out and fight crime at the behest of the spider as a telepathic link with him. And that's how kind of the story gets catapulted. Are the spider and Spider-Man like a dynamic duo? No the spider actually ends up dying a few years later. That's sad how did he die? Natural causes. There's a lot of natural causes going on in this story. There was a lot of facts in there that are actually true which is a big deal. Of course everyone knows the story of Spider-Man Peter Parker his",

Of course everyone knows the story of Spider-Man Peter Parker his parents die. And depending on the continuity why maybe they're spies maybe they're not. The new movies seem like they're doing something interesting with that but we're not 100% sure just yet. Raised by Aunt May Uncle Ben gets bitten by a radioactive spider not just a normal spider in a terrarium. Uncle Ben also not in charge of any rice empire no that's not happening. Ben gets killed by the guy Spider-Man let it go at that wrestling match or wherever he is then all hell breaks loose he decides to be Spider-Man go and save the day. Thanks for watching.
