Um this is a tough this is a tough topic. Yeah you can you can come at it whatever Direction you want. All right so my party has a pretty repblic Republican party has a pretty strict no illegal immigrant platform no illegal immigrant right yeah um and I understand that platform like very much okay okay um I think illegal immigration is wrong and it's a crime and um if you came here illegally you're wrong for doing it sure and you don't have any rights to be like any right to be here and you have really no like rights within the greater federal system to like get you know welfare or housing or anything like that which some people enjoy and they shouldn't mhm it's wrong okay with",
