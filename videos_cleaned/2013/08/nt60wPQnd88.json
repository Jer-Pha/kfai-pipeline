What's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg and this is my roommate Colin.

It has taken up thank you all so much for your support though in watching these shows every week. Colin, when we started this, did you think it was going to work? Did you think it was going to last? How how many episodes were we going to do in your head? I don't know, like just the ones we filmed the first day basically. Uh no, I remember you came back from VidCon last year, the YouTube convention, right? And you had this great idea apparently, weren't you driving in a van, is that true? Yeah, we drove in a van to to the airport, yeah and this is where you had the idea, right? Did yeah yeah and you said you want to have a convers a series about me because I say crazy things, right? Um and you you hit me up with that and I was like that's a cool idea, I'm down with this, but I didn't really expect that it would become the very mild, very mild right, YouTube phenomenon only in the amongst the people that actually know who we",

It kind of phenomena yeah, but it's it's growing. That's the weird thing I didn't see coming. I think we we tend to forget that how privileged we are for the audience we have, right? You know what I mean? Like we work for IGN, there's 3.3 million YouTube subscribers. So you look at our 30,000 YouTube subscribers like no that's cute, you know what I mean? But there's people who there's I did when I was doing the Oreo show, another product of VidCon, uh I was sitting there and like people leave video responses and one of the guys did a video response I remember and he's like so you know Greg only has at the time like it was like 12,000, 20,000 subscribers, you should go over there and subscribe and like all the comments were like I only have 100, like you know what I mean?

Yeah what's really funny about it right is that Or ation and Conversation With Colin are both shows that I started because I have an idea for another show I want to do and I knew I wasn't good enough to do that show like I didn't know how to edit video, I didn't know how to do any that stuff and now that I think I'm ready for that show I still don't want to stop doing this show. Yeah I think we I think we'll stop doing Conversation With Colin when people don't want them anymore and it seems like every season we do the numbers grow so um tell your friends please. Yeah so there's there's uh you know we're trying to find the balance between like this is the thing that people don't realize is that I really don't know the topics.

I saw the mun card and I told you about it and you still used it so that wasn't that wasn't my fault. Well again like you I always like you're like oh yeah I you know I've only known one of the topics conversation the other day you're like it's surprising that I haven't been stump ed at one of these conversations. It's like well **** **** I'm P I'm pulling topics that I know you have an opinion on. It's rare that I'm it's not like I'm just every topic I get I'm like well **** into the pile astro physics let's see what he has to say about shoelaces.

Yeah um but yeah no I'm you know I I appreciate that everyone really enjoys the show and and we kind of do the serious topics and we kind of do the zany topics and we're kind of keep a balance everybody. Yeah we'll keep doing Conversation With Colin as long as everyone out there wants it and I I've quite enjoyed doing the way I see it is we're going to keep getting bigger and keep getting bigger and then we'll take conversations on like college tours and then like when the money really gets involved that's when we'll start hating each other and like we won't really talk anymore and then we only show up for convers it'll be this huge explosion they hate each other no but they don't talk to each other at all they've been working for over 40 years together and they just like have",

Wow I don't want that I love you too much. We'll see good kid we'll see what happens. Uh what's your favorite episode of A Conversation With Colin? Uh that's tough. Um I think the the one I had the most fun doing was uh probably the Star Wars one. Oh yes that's a recent one but I like there's like I like the the political ones the most because I I feel like you know the Republican one is another one that we did early that I I thought was actually really fun because I just feel like you know we get a lot of comments especially from people in Europe that are you know because their you know hyper liberal slanted media just like our hyper liberal slanted media paints an entire half of the United States is crazy redneck you know uneducated people and I like to show",

I think was uh who'd win in a fight? Yeah that was a good one that was just a and like that's like one of our most successful ones people like to see us argue about fighting each other apparently. Yeah and and we've learned lessons too about the ones we probably shouldn't be doing anymore. I think in retrospect the one about paper versus grocery bag one wasn't a good one wasn't a good one.

Hey you know pennies probably not a really good topic right right uh you know but there were some cool ones that I didn't think would do well that I thought were really Kinda Funny like the Electoral College was a fun one. Yeah um yeah we you know Girl Meets World, Girl Meets World great cats versus dogs, cats versus dogs. Yeah so I can't believe there's still things to talk about but apparently there there more and they're getting better. I'm really excited this is the first conversation of the day today for so we have many left to go spoilers we filmed them all in one day some of you started putting it together also yes Colin drinks water out of a milk glass it's not as funny as you all think it is I don't know why everybody comments about it but speaking about funny right speaking about funny before we move on before Greg before we you do this right you do like",

It's funny because when we did Horribly Wrong well it's we had the same kind of thing right with Conversation With Colin we watched the first season and I was like I don't you know I was like I don't know if these are going to work like you know we asked like how long we were going to do them right and and you know when we did Horribly Wrong Comic Book Origins again I was like these aren't funny you like be very very candid with with the with I knew Conversation With Colin was funny I remember I remember in the middle of filming season 1 like we took a break after like six in you're like I guess I do say crazy things like you didn't you weren't even convinced like that when we sat down to do it",

Yeah I was I wasn't confident in those at all and uh so I guess what I'm saying is like our own gauge of what people want uh isn't as important as what they want and so like we're going to continue to listen to what the readers want if they want more conversation with com give it to them. Yeah no matter what the comic gorons I told you in the comments one of them has to hit 100,000 views period that was hard Batman's a quarter of the way there so just keep watching him just watch him over",
