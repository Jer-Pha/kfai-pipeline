It turns out a year ago I announced I had that Hodgkins lymphoma, that cancer that took my life. Come with me. Well, it didn't take my life, but it took over my life. I'm right here. Obviously, I'm dead. Uh, it's surprising, right, that I didn't even think about it. I didn't even cognizantly think that August 9th was the day that I kind of came out on this one and said, \"Hey, I have cancer, everybody.\" And that's weird. I was more hung up on next week's the one-year anniversary of a conversation with Colin. So, I was like, I have a whole bunch of stuff prepped for that . I'm totally ready for that. But, yeah, the cancer thing I wasn't ready to deal with today. So, I guess the only thing I can say, right, is thank you. Like, yeah, you know, I couldn't have done any of this without you guys'support . Obviously, August 9th when I put up the blog, Kotaku, a whole bunch of",

Obviously, August 9th when I put up the blog, Kotaku, a whole bunch of other sites, they came out and, you know, supported me, put up some messages about me. That meant, you know, the world to me, obviously. But then, of course, the outpouring of love from you guys, my fans, my subscribers, everything like that. Uh, I wasn't expecting it, you know what I mean? Like I knew it would I knew people were going to care, but I didn't think people were caring the way they were, right? Even like, you know, when we started going through all the stuff recently as a community with like Ryan Davis, like you know, like during Jeff Keely's Game Trailers thing, you mentioned eye cancer last year and it kind of unified the group a little bit as far as like games journals. I don't know, game people who care about games and video games and stuff like that. And so , like, you",

I don't know, game people who care about games and video games and stuff like that. And so, like, you know, cancer was by far the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. Like, you know, chemo is terrible. Like, it's just awful. Like, it I wasn't I wasn't prepared for that. Like, it was a lot tougher than I thought it would be. And like, even in the blog I put up , right, like last year, I said that, you know, like you chances are you were taking it harder than I was. And, uh, it was true. Like, the only time I got choked up finding out I had cancer was when I was reading like the CT report, right? And it was like, \"Oh, it's all up here.\" And, you know, not it wasn't in my face. I don't know why I just my face but all up here and in my armpits and stuff in my chest and like that's I got choked up but I never cried and then like when I told people like they had you know my family cried",

I thought I was going to go in get the chemo and be done and like that first chemo I went to like that's the one where you if you read the blog I put up afterwards I talked about you know like they gave me a test and it turned out I was allergic to the test. I still have a bruise. I think it's permanent. I don't know. And that's when I lost my vision and I lost feeling in this side of the body. And then they had to like put IVs in different hands and stuff . And that's when I came home and like when I finally got home like I shut the door and went in my room and just baldled like like I couldn't believe how tough it was. And it only got worse. It was a lot worse than that after a while. And so I don't even think",

And so I don't even think about it anymore. That was like I don't know. It's it's hard to put into words, right? Like I was supposed to be on a 9-month regimen, but I was only I did it in six cuz for some reason I'm fasted that and slowed everything else to life. But I mean it was 6 months of you know I got it in August we pretty much started and it was done like I my final chemo right before uh Christmas and so it's bizarre to think now it's you know again we're back to August so it's you know seven eight months without any like worries, right? I have hair again except for this white spot and it's a different life. for it. You know, I mean, you think back to that, even a year ago, I wasn't going through chemo yet. Like, it was still a completely different life. So, it's this weird alternate universe where it all",

So, it's this weird alternate universe where it all happened and I kind of compartmentalize it and forget about it, right? And then I worry about my dumb YouTube shows or what I got to review here, who's coming on Up At Noon or what these guest is or what, you know what I mean? Like, you get caught up in all the other stuff and you forget how lucky you are. And I'm lucky because of you. I'm lucky for the support you've given me. I would not have been able to do this without you guys. And like this is one of the things I couldn't articulate at Beyond 300 because at Beyond 300 I started to get choked up at the end and I just stopped because it wasn't the place like we had a whole bunch of people who really wanted to get drunk and we had a band who wanted to perform and Troy Baker he was over there tapping his foot.

And have an outpouring of support like this. So as always, thank you for your support. Follow me on Twitter. Subscribe to the YouTube channel and I'll talk to you later. Beyond started. I'll edit out all the rest. Do you want this frame like as you get to the bottom or should I have the whole slide and show you sliding? Frame it so I slide in frame. Okay. Fine. I know. All set. Yep.
