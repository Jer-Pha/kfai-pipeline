I approved the expense report for this dress and I feel really good about it like a little baby being bored. There's one hand [Music] that's tucking in your back flap. Thank you. This this is what it's going to be like on your wedding day when we're helping you get ready. Maybe not the best representation of Peach hair, not canon, but we'll make it work. Suck at Xbox. If this doesn't end with you guys making out, everybody on the Internet is going to be very disappointed. It started with them making out. What do you mean in with them? Oh yeah, she does. No, that's much better. Just a giant bra. Is that uncomfortable? None of this is. It's like made of cardboard as I can't see. I can't see you guys. How do I look as a a group shot of all three of you guys? Same as [Music] always. What's up everybody? Welcome to Up at Noon. Yes.",
