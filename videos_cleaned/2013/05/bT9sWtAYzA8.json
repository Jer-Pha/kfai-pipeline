So so so much, so so so much that we decided to make a YouTube series of videos with our season two predictions. Season one just wrapped up, the finale just went down and it was batshit crazy. It was batshit crazy. I could have decided better myself. Funny. Um, every episode we tackle a new relationship, make some predictions about it . Today we're talking about Teddy and Peggy. Mm, what's going to happen to Teggy? Teggy, Tgy, that's their couple name. That's their couple name, Tgy. I'm not good with words, funny that I talk into a camera and mic all day. What's going to happen, Kristine? Um, I think he will end up forgiving her obviously cuz he has to. Oh, sorry. So cuz she leaked the divorce to the P. So what, big deal? So what only caused a lot of pain to their children. They quick recap if you need it. Teddy and Peggy, they were working together on this Cumberland deal years ago. Oh, right. They em the",

Teddy and Peggy, they were working together on this Cumberland deal years ago. Oh, right. They em the whole the other long thread of this. Yeah, there's very few things that go past one episode in Nashville in terms of threads . This was one of them. Uh, they covered up some financial bad stuff. Uh, then they were going to have it exposed when he was running for mayor, but they didn't. But then they tried to think say that they were having an affair, but they weren't. But then they really started having an affair for like 10 minutes before Teddy went to go break up with Raina, be with Peggy. Then Peggy and him were together, then it turned out that the divorce got leaked to the tabloids by Peggy. Yes, then Teddy dumped her, said get the hell out of my life pretty much. Yeah , cuz he had hired her exactly. Herial team, is this what being a mayor is like too? Cuz it was really like he's like the president of Nashville.",

Maybe it's just our mayor of San Francisco is so terrible . Oh, well, it's probably true. It's true. Get some trash cans on the street. Um, but then so it seems like he's cut Ted Ted, Teddy is going to cut ties with Peggy and uh Teggy, just call him Teggy. Teggy T, they were going to break up. They're going no more. And then Peggy comes in and says she's pregnant and that's how their thread pauses for. Yeah, cuz now what's happening is the Cumberland deal is being investigated by the feds, right? And so they talked to him and alone. Yeah, I think they were basically like we can pin this all on Peggy, we should do that. What did he say? I don't remember this part.

That's look at that instead Portell somewh no and so and then I'm assuming he had the idea that they were probably giving the same story to Peggy. Oh yeah, CU he asked her about that. She's like I told her nothing. Yeah, and she was like what did they say? Why didn't you make a plea deal to save yourself? And she was like I'm pregnant you so what now do you think she's really pregnant? Yeah, I don't they've boed enough times.

I don't know cuz here's the thing they didn't really go into their birth control methods. Sure. I they should have. Peggy, of course, played by Brad Paisley's wife, uh star of not she is the star of Father of the Bride. He wasn't she she was also oh my God that is her. She was also in According to Jim forever, but I understand no one ever watch that show. Here's the thing she's a seems like a lovely lady. Brad Paisley is a lovely man. I'm sure that means she's a kind of ruined the season finale song. No, well yeah, it's not as good as it can't harmonize anyways, go ahead. Peggy as a character has those crazy eyes.

She's faking the pregnancy trying to and and it might not be a bad move cuz what what they're saying with the whole cumber room deal is if maybe she forces the card that I'm pregnant that means they get married and then they can do the whole I can't testify against my spouse thing. Ooh, I forgot about that. But I but if that's what it was going to be I would play it as that rather than all of a sudden I'm pregnant oh I miscarried and I never had any symptoms and we never wanted to get an ultrasound you know what I mean? But the pregnancy might Force the hand of the marriage to get it going. I'm going to go she's really pregnant.

I'm not that I'm just saying it's kind of rude. It's a douchy move. Do you think that the pregnancy is from that first time and they're going to be able to like chart it back like through like the okay cuz they've had sex so many times after that they wouldn't be like it's not like that was a one rare occurrence. Sure, but it wouldn't I mean I wouldn't put it past them to be like try to make that cuz like I was saying Teddy still seems to me like a good guy. He's made some bad decisions. He's done some dumb stuff obviously. I mean they could if the baby was like what three months long and then they just got divorced like few months ago then that would be like oh that's a good point too.

MH mhm interestingly interesting and then another secret that's another thing that you do if you get knocked up in an in opportune time if you have if you get knocked up up at an in opportune time come to Kristine's YouTube channel for tips on how to cover it up. Yes interesting well again I think Peggy is crazy and I totally think my prediction for her character going forward in this is that she's going to be the Glenn Close she's going to have a a freaking psycho Fatal Attraction kind of spin-off here in this thing where like season one will end with her like trying to kill",

You don't think so? Am I going too Melrose Place? I'm feeling meloy place about this but then jul mother murdered a man. Yeah, she loves him like in a crazy way. Sure, sure, but kind I love you and if you ever leave me um but I don't think she's dangerous and I do think the pregnancy's real. I don't think she would lie about well she might lie about it but I just think in this case it's probably real. Okay, but we'll see you could be right.
