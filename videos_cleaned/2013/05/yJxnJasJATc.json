That's why we started this YouTube series where we make season two predictions about the hit ABC drama. Kristine , we go through, we pair people up, we tell them what we think is gonna happen to him in season two. We're starting this episode with Lamar and Tandy. Yes, Lamar, of course, the old man who was like, he's, I loved him in episode one. Lamar, you know, starts pulling the strings, he's gonna make Teddy the mayor to get his baseball stadium and then that that thread totally went quiet forever and ever and ever and Lamar popped back up to talk about his baseball thing in the second half of the season almost it seemed. It seemed like we were talking about the baseball stadium. Yeah , he's been there, he's been there but I I want more Lamar. I love Lamar. Lamar's great. He's got the D he does have a really good Powers Booth is his name by the",

He's got the D he does have a really good Powers Booth is his name by the way too, the actor. Really? I mean that's probably that is an awesome name. That is an awesome stage name. So Tandy, of course, then uh his other daughter. Yes, Reyna's sister. Yeah, they were BFFs for most of the season then he has heart attack. He kind of made amends with Reyna and he started then he started hating on Tandy. Yeah, although to be fair while he was indisposed convalescing , uh Tandy kind of made some shitty moves to try and take over the business. Yeah, she started making some moves behind the scenes to take over. He did not like that one bit. No, then that's what it is. You do not just like you don't spit into the wind or tuck on Superman's cape. Yep, you don't mess with Lamar. You don't mess with Lamar. Uh Lamar though, yeah, he basically he's been the bad guy.

He's been like the guy in with the glass of brandy and the cigar like wait, you know, I always just need the cat. He does. He's always there screwing around behind the scenes and now we're ready to see what he does in season two. What do you think's gonna happen in season two? I think Tandy and this is this is a random thing. Yeah, I think she is going to go either start up her own company or join in forces with a rival company and try and get the baseball stadium built there. Um yeah, see I think that's it. It's definitely them butting heads all of a sudden but it's gotta be because she quit in season two or something seasonal. Yeah, yeah and remember like that like business stuff isn't super exciting so I think she's gonna try to she already tried to blow everything up with Coleman, right?

Where she went to call me I was like looking at the Cumberland deal and all this other stuff and he was like I don't really want to do that but he did you did do that though or she did do we know her you're pretty sure you're not sure though pretty sure okay but not sure I'm not willing to bet my life wouldn't know there you go so I think it could have been her too she might be blowing that up too she's trying to make herself a player in Nashville. You got to be a power player in Nashville if you want to live and that's what I'm saying she's got to join voices with someone else because on her own and it's not going to be Coleman you're right because Coleman already was like no I'm not interested. We haven't met many mean businessmen though we haven't so I'm wondering if that's just gonna be a new thing that kind of pops up in season two some new new",

So what's Lamar kind of he was not evil but he was definitely a bad guy he was doing bad things in season one but then he got a heart attack and he kind of started to come around again. Is he gonna be a nice guy in season two you think? No, I think he'll be a kinder man to his family except for maybe Tandy now if she if she does decide to go on the uh I can't take the lord her own on her yeah well no it was more like attack you know uh oh she should play all routes okay you know if she tries to to grab that land and build a baseball stadium somewhere else that she will benefit and not her father that could totally subsidize them but you know in terms of the other you know Reyna and the grandkids I think he'll be a better family man maybe but still as rude as ever with",

I've been waiting for this one. I've been waiting to work him in. Watty. Oh, Watty, the old music producer guy who cheated on who? Yeah, he had an affair with Lamar's wife and that's what ruined his relationship with Reyna. That's a good point in that we've been waiting for that to come out because he flipped out of the hospital so if you wanted to hurt him what would you do you if you're Tammy? Yep, you team up although I don't know what he does except for yeah he's got a ton of money it doesn't matter that's true hey help me finance this baseball stadium or this uh construction company or whatever that could work but then Watty always seems like a nice guy she's a really nice guy so she would have to manipulate him in some way in order to convince him to do this",

One of my predictions is that Watty's going to die this season. No, it's why he served his purpose. What is left for Watty? What what what juice is still not good? You don't need him to die just let him be. He's going to die just let it be. Maybe he'll probably die at the hand of some with the actions of Lamar or Tandy. Tammy's a snake you get in bed with her I don't mean literally it's trouble trouble's a foot if you get in this business deal absolutely once she squeezes all the juice out of the grape she'll strike like the cobra she is. Hmm yeah again I see very you know a lot of similarities between her and her dad Lamar in that although they can be very loyal and loving to their family members they are willing to make the toughest decisions when it comes to business right to get whatever they",

Okay interesting we'll see what happens in season two uh before we say goodbye to our predictions we're gonna do the wild card prediction Kristine as you know each and every episode ends with us letting the gods make a prediction we made our educated guesses but you're gonna reach in the people bag then the places or things bag and we're gonna see what happens we'll see we'll see what they think's gonna happen the gods so who do we got in the people back Gunner oh Gunner the biggest **** the biggest **** what's gonna happen to don't know Gunner season two not really I like that actor wait it's it's cut off ah it's because it's a two-parter oh Gunner the first part is has sex",
