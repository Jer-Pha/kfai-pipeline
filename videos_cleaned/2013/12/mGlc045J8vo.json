Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg, and this is my roommate, Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at him, and we talk it out for your amusement. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to the channel, share this video with your friends. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is should the death penalty be abolished, submitted by @AMcCarthy83 . No, I agree. I think if anything, it should be ramped up a bit. I agree. I think it should be like, because here's the thing, a lot of these people, they'll start telling you that it doesn't solve everything, this that, and the other. I think that if you just started executing people, be like based, and not like, I'm not saying like, oh man, you **** jaywalked or something stupid, you know what I mean? But like,",

I think that if you just started executing people be like based, and not like, I'm not saying like, oh man, you **** jaywalked or something stupid, you know what I mean? But like that'd be we make we we move the death penalty line down a bit. Right now the standard is too high to get killed. Come down a bit. Yeah, to where if you're just being some **** jackass, **** endangering lives and stuff, you're out, you're out of the pool. We worry about anymore. So this is tough because, you know, there's due process, right? And that's important. You get three trials. Yeah, three strikes. Well, you get a lot, like you get a lot of trials. This is the what? No, no, what I'm saying is in the Greg Miller plan here, and are some innocent people going to die? Of course, they're going to die, and that sucks. I'm sorry. I hope I'm never falsely accused and that, you know, I have to go through my own thing. I've set up my head, but seriously, third time guilty, they walk you to the side and blow your brains out.",

I'm not going to steal or be an ****. So that's harsh. That's that's really harsh. I know. So I I I think the death penalty is totally fine. Um I think that um argu like I really think the arguments against the the penalty are borderline incoherent and what is it that we shouldn't think to their level? There's something that like the state shouldn't kill people. We shouldn't, you know, two wrongs don't make a right, that kind of thing . I say like that's garbage. Um uh and I my favorite argument is that it costs more to kill them than it does to keep them in prison and that the reason that is true is because we give them like 17 appeals and keep them alive for four years before we execute them. So yeah, so here's",

So yeah, so here's here's I've thought a great deal about this actually, lat on me and @AMcCarthy83. So the death penalty right now is only for C like cap it's a capital crime, right? You killed you've killed someone. I actually think that it should be uh wider than that. I think that how where you bring if you raped a woman , if you hurt if you touched a child or hurt a child, that kind of like violent like a really heinously violent crime. Raping a woman is really just as bad as murder. Something you might as well have killed that woman. I'm to say raping anybody. Yeah, of course, right? But you know, I'm just I'm helping there are there are male rap there are male rape victims. That is true. Yeah. Um and but see then just I'm trying to I'm trying to poke holes in your theory already that would come out right there's that",

Nick Scarpino staring the cameras apart everything's gone to hell. Kill Nick too. So I I really think that with with you know the death penalty like we have to make sure that in his people aren't being killed and that happen and it's not right it's not right like and that I agree is is a is a knock against the death penalty. I think that you have to you have to take it one step at a time. Did you do it? Yes or no. If you did it, are we sure you did it? Yeah, yeah, yes or no. If we're sure you did it, is the evidence conclusive where everyone knows that there's no possible way you didn't do it, you know, taking the reasonable doubt thing to another degree, then you you execute the person. You don't give them any time for any more appeals. Yeah, if you if someone is killed and there's some",

Yeah, if you if someone is killed and there's some circumstantial evidence or there's no body for instance or something like that like you can't really prove it. Yeah, and so you can't execute them. You know, it's like um what was that that cop Peterson right that was the cop the smug smug the smug **** cop Drew Peterson Drew peton and like there's like I think that whole case against him is totally circumstantial. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So and I'm sure he did it but you can't really prove it if like you can prove with Ballistics if you can prove with DNA evidence all these kinds of things they did it then you execute them with with rape that's actually really easy to do most of the time if the the woman or the man has has you know the DNA under the fingernails sure but then you get into the whole like you know you know the whole Like It's",
