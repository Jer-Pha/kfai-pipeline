So I went to Japan the other day, just popped over for the hell of it, and people keep asking me now that I'm back what's the coolest, craziest, Most Japanese thing I went and did and or saw? And the answer of course is the Robot Restaurant in Shinjuku. Now you go down there and of course Shinjuku in general, very gaudy, lots of neon lights, lots of alleyways, stuff like that. But you got to this Robot Restaurant and you immediately knew you were in a different different atmosphere and that's just walking in. That's before the show even happens, just neon light and if you were epileptic you were going down, there was no doubt about it. Something was going to catch the side of your eye and you're going up. But then you get down there and like you know they gave you this bento box and it's this giant like basically runway with like seats on one side, seats on the other and I'm me and Christine are front row on our on our seat thing and then you know they kill the",

Finally they've been serving you some drinks then this thing comes out from the side and it's this giant plane structure or whatever. It's got all these all these women on it in bikinis. It looks like [Music] this. So yeah, it becomes apparent pretty quickly that yeah there's robots I guess in the fact that like they're on a motorized platform that I can see people like using RC controls to move around but the real draw here is the half naked Asian women just everywhere dancing and singing and chanting like this. And so then they show this like video package on the screens behind them and of course it's in Japanese so I can't understand a lick of it cuz I love to go to countries I have no relevancy in and it's again the half naked women and they're showing different things but they",

The robot evil guys come out and then the animal creatures start coming and the first wave of animal creatures are Kung Fu Panda and his friends but it's not you know like a cartoon version of these people it's knockoff Kung Fu Panda outfits that come out and fight robot men. [Music] So of course these knockoff Kung Fu Panda people they just get schooled, just destroyed. Nobody they're not going to stop these robot people so who do you call in next? You call in Captain America who is again a scandy clad Asian woman with a Captain America shield and I think a",

You call in Captain America who is again a scandy clad Asian woman with a Captain America shield and I think a Thor hammer. So she comes out she gets treaded, it doesn't go well for her. Next up spider lady which is just a giant mechanized spider with another half naked Asian woman on it. [Music] [Applause] As you see I mean they put up a good fight or she put up a good fight you know spits the web out everything else eventually she goes back though again there's you know the the bad guys are dancing around like they won then the kicker ladies and gentlemen big old shark with half naked Asian woman on top of it. [Music] [Music] I so yeah that shark came out it ate the bad guy you know things going well and then of course how do you top that off more half naked dancing Asian women.

Why not call it a half naked woman restaurant? I mean be legit about what you're getting because again most of these things they they aren't even robots right? Look at this guy. [Music] That's a dude in the suit. Now I don't know it's a it looks like a robot he acts like a robot there were some RC parts to this some of the contraptions these people were in they needed they needed two people to move them around and do stuff and they they sure do love the lights the the Technicolor lights. [Music] But I mean that's what it was right? It was like a few dudes in robot suits and then a bunch of women just hanging out half naked a lot of them had weird bruises too I don't know what that says about them or the show but I loved it so yeah Robot",
