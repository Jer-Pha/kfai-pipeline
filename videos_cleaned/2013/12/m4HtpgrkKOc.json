I'm Greg and this is my roommate, Colin.

If you like that, like this episode of the show, subscribe to our channel, share us with your friends. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is how the fridge handle broke from Had Meat Petrello. This is a this an ongoing thing that everybody out there likes to **** about. It's this stupid thing. Every of these we put up the note here saying we know it's broken. You could stop telling us in the YouTube comments below. We like the comments that it's broken, but it's broken. We get it. We don't we don't uh I don't really know when it happened. It's a it's it's old fridge. It's not that old. It's maybe 20 years old. Maybe that's old. Is",

It's maybe 20 years old. Maybe that's old. Is it old for fridges? Yeah, you are you're replacing a fridge like every 10 to 10 to 12 years. I don't think there's any like set rules to when when you replace them, but 20 years old for an appliance is a lot. I mean, you still using your 20-year old PlayStation 3? No, no, no. Then you breaks, you get a new one. You do all this other stuff, right? Right, right. I I don't really know the rules of appliances. I don't know. There are rules. I saw a really disgusting thing on Reddit the other day that is like, oh man, you it turns out you need to clean your dishwasher and it was he pulled out his dishwasher like spinning thing and there's all this meing groc oh gross. We don't use the dishwasher because it's too expensive. Want well, it's not see you you you think it's too expensive. You're running out here pinching",

You're running out here pinching pennies all the time. Yeah, you're crazy. Someone's got to do it. I uh well the the whole heat story is funny because when we moved in together I was like, we don't use the heat. We don't use the Heat and if I hear any of you **** talking about it, I'll tell you how cold it is in Boston and then like two weeks later you were the first person I'm turn on the heat. It's too cold ran out there. It was true. I was a **** but you know what? I don't I feel like even thinking about appliances is too adult for me. I'm 29 years old, Greg. I'm ready for a new fridge. Well, we don't this place. I'm not buying **** but but see this is what I always talking about.

I just like where do you even begin? How the **** do you buy a fridge, Greg? Like what do you do? You go into Sears? Yeah, and you just start looking at fridges and then suddenly the frigid air **** strikes you. Yeah, and you're like I got to get this kind ridiculous is I don't I don't you got to read it's like my dad like he reads Consumer Reports and I always make fun of them. Yeah, like the Consumer Reports has a purpose. Sometimes you need to know what the **** the best microwave is. Sure, not all the time. Yeah, three four times in your lifetime you need to know when the best mic the microwave is though. It's true. That's very true. As far as the fridge handle, I have no I I remember breaking.

He fell into the fridge into into like into the crack between the cabinets of the fridge and the fridge moved over. Yeah, and our other two roommates were like actual men like we laughing at us and St like that. So it's possible that these kinds of things can happen. Sure, these kinds of fridge related incidents, but I think we I mean like we started A Conversation With Colin talking with you about the the F the the house has ants. Yeah, I think we know the kind of the kind of damage we're doing to this place on a daily basis. I don't think the fridge handle is the biggest problem.

I told you this this is like a big revelation for me because we the house is clean. They're not coming here for the food. They're coming actually when the rainy season starts in San Francisco, they're looking to get inside and and I fig out where they're coming from. We haven't seen any in here since then because I sprayed the **** out of that hole. I got to spray the shower today. I got in the shower. I have two ant traps in the shower. They're crawling on top of the ant traps just chilling. I'm like they don't **** about the ant trap. I think I think they're becoming Savvy and smart to the ant trap.

We super glued at one point and then it immediately broke again. Yeah, I think we need like a hot glue gun. You need like that real real the real bonding adhesives. Remember the first time you used a hot glue gun cuz I do, Greg. I remember my mom was always doing that crafty **** you're like what the **** there's something special about a hot glue gun is in there like like you you have these glue sticks that are hard and kind of just going like this with yeah like a stick and then you put it in this gun and suddenly it's liquid and you accidentally touch it every once in a while and it burns the **** **** out of your finger.

Yeah, uh but we might be able to buy one a cheap one and and fix the door handle. 20 I won't spend more than $20 on seems like a lot of work. We talk about getting a handyman here sometimes. We we talk about a lot of things that we don't end up doing because everyone's **** profoundly lazy in this apartment. We'll get it done eventually. Yeah, I had a handyman come hang pictures on my wall. You did you did you had a handyman come in to hang up pictures of superheroes in your bedroom, Greg. How old are you? 30 30 years old.

Let's like he was very good at he's very he did a nice job like what kind of business is that like something he does on the side at night? I mean can you can you sustain your business hanging up pictures? I'd hope so. How much did he charge you? I don't want to get that now was like an hour I think it was like 15 bucks for an hour. You paid a man a real man with tools and levels and rulers $115. I would have hung up those pictures for you but we would have done it20.

So that's why the fridge handle is broken. We're lazy. We don't really know how to fix it. We tried to fix it. What are you going to do about it? Thanks for asking the question many people had uh Had Meat Pell. That's a weird that's a weird name. What about Portillo? It's not Portillo. He spelled this differently. P's got his new Japanese outfit though. Uh ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for watching.
