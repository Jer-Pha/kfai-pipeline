I'm Greg, and while you were watching some **** named Harley stuff a Buick into a turkey, the fine people at Oreo are making endless variations of milk's favorite cookie. So each and every Wednesday and then every Friday, I open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, subscribe to my channel, like this video, and then please share Oreo Oration with your friends. Everyone eats Oreos, not just nerdy G people like me. Today we are reviewing Golden Oreo Mega Stuf. Mega Stuf, M Stuf. I have to do it with my voice'cause I don't know how to really do that. Uh, of course Wednesday we did Regular Oreo Omega Stuf. They were an experience. I mean, it's a she of cream in my mouth right now. Now let's see what's happening before we even get into the first look. I'm a bit terrified at how the shortbread cookie sweetness will mix with the over sweetness of the cream, but that's why you need me to do it so you don't",

I'm a bit terrified at how the shortbread cookie sweetness will mix with the over sweetness of the cream, but that's why you need me to do it so you don't have to. First Look, open the back. Oh, they're looking good. Hold on. That's weird. A gap there you can't fill, huh? Well, not impressed with that, but what am I going to do? First look, they look pretty good. They're all intact. That's the big thing. God damn, look at that fat ****. She's just little creams falling out her side. Um , they look good. Pulling one out here. Oh, oh no, no. All right, there we go. Look at that guy there. This is what Mega Stuf is, ladies and gentlemen, as we just discovered last week or last Wednesday on Oration. Um, they aren't two double stuffs put together. They're like a double stuff and then a regular Oreo. We're calling them the try stuff. They're the brand new try stuff. I can understand why they put Mega'cause that's easier to understand than try. Um, let's let's see how they taste. Wow .",

Um, let's let's see how they taste. Wow. Okay, don't jump ahead of me here. I'm going to tell you I don't like it. Not that I don't like the cookie. The taste, it tastes good or taste good. These are going to score well, I'll tell you already, but the problem being that the shortbread cookie doesn't allow the obscene amount of cream to speak to you at all. It's just one glob of taste that's very sweet and it's good. It's not overly sweet. You know, I'm not a huge fan of cookies that are overly sweet. You've watched the show, I'm sure we are checking out, but it's almost to the point of like, why would I need these to be Mega Stuffed? They tasted good as double stuffs. They tasted good as regular stuffs, but I don't think there's I like to look at Oreo cookies as spectrum of taste and right now there's no Spectrum here. It's just like I got a gold or",

It's just like I got a gold or I got some cream that there's there's one there's a line of taste where they all taste the same. Not a big fan of it. Let's see how past taste with milk. Maybe milk will bring something out inside of them as it often brings stuff out inside of me. Here comes the the dunk test, your meloy moment. One, two, three. Mhm, similar problem. Um, the milk makes the shortbread cookie tastes different in a good way. This will taste really good, but then again is once you're through that initial first, you know, on your tongue that first taste, it moves to just being a sweet overload. Your tongue starts freaking out as I'm sure used to for other situations, but in this situation, it's just too sweet. It overloads the taste buds. You got no idea what you're really getting into. Let's see how they twist. Obviously a huge part",

They make great then there you go. Sixpence None the Richer Oreo with like the stap puff marshmallow foot in there. Not going to eat it because that will where it's one of those things everybody worries about me getting diabetes. I can tell you right now my brain's like, hold the **** up, you are very close. We're g I'll call the doctor and I'll come over with the saw to take your leg. Final score for Mega Stuf Golden Oreos. H m, it's hard, right? I'm passing judgment. This will affect the stock of Golden Oreo Mega Stuf. I take my job very seriously here. I can't say seriously, but I believe I'm going to go 75. They're good. They're good. I but it's one of those",

They're good. I but it's one of those things where you're not getting a benefit from all this cream. You're getting all this cream, all this cream's coming in your face into your mouth and you're just like cool, but I can eat the other Oreos in the Lesser packaging, probably get more Oreos per the box, so I'd be more popular at the beach, but they don't taste that much better. I mean, that's that's the way the cookie crumbles for the Golden Oreo Mega Stuf. But what do you think? Grab your iPhone, turn it around, leave a video response in the comments below. You'll be featured in future episodes of Oreo ration telling me what you thought of this cookie, this little cookie from a little company called Nabisco.
