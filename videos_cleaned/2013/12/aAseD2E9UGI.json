So every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, please like this video, subscribe to my channel, share it with your friends so they can all come see what it is I think is valuable use of my free time. Today we're reviewing Candy Cane Oreos. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, these are some limited edition holiday special Oreos. Uh, we have already had a fan submit a video response to this, that she did her own review. Let's see some of it. I feel like this packaging is quite phallic. This looks like a candy cane penis with Oreo balls. She's good. She has a future in the Oreo review business, let me tell you. Uh, every Oreo ration begins with the patented First Look. Have these open. Here's the creepy part. Candy Cane Oreos, clearly you know",

Candy Cane Oreos, clearly you know something you put on the shelf maybe at the end of October, beginning of November. They are good until April. These have a shelf life of till April. They have been around the block. Woo. Okay, this is weird. I don't, I'm not a fan of the Oreo bag, but woo. Okay, it's like I just brushed my teeth. Uh, there they are. First look, they're all on a hard casing, which I like, reinforced of course, and Lord Jesus, do they smell like candy canes and mint. Oh, okay, let's take one out and see what they look like, I guess. Got the red and white there. It's, it's split right down the middle, kind of like a two-face, right? However you dident, uh , one side is a snowflake. That's cute. Are they all snowflakes? Yeah, got one side Oreo traditional, what you'd want to see, one side snowflake. All right, that's the first look. Let's get a taste.",

What does it taste like, ladies and gentlemen? What do you think? A Thin Mint. We got a Thin Mint competitor here. Uh, we've of course done the fudge covered Oreos, the mint fudge covered Oreos . We thought they tasted a lot like a Thin Mint. These guys really tasting like a Thin Mint. I like this a lot. Still crispy, so got the crispy shell, not shell, sorry, cookie. Then you got the mint in there. It's, I talked about when I took it out, right, that had an overwhelming mint smell to it. Tastes not overwhelming at all, very subdued, mixes very nice with the chocolate and the mint. Big fan. I'm enjoying this so far. Let's see how this pairs with milk. Give it the old Melroy minute.",

Give it the old Melroy minute. One, two, three. I don't think the milk is adding anything to it . I also don't think it's detracting at all from it either. It's, I mean, it's still a very, very good mint cookie. Um, I like what's happening with it. I'm, I'm a fan. I'm enjoying what they're doing here. Uh, up next, twist. How are these guys going to twist? A big part of an Oreo. Boop, perfect. I think Oreo's got it down. I think they figured it out finally. Boom. Yeah, well that one broke apart in my hands like Dust in the Wind, but bam, there you go. Twisted fine, perfect twist. Two out of three didn't have to go to the third one for the final one. Um, usually now is where we jump to the final score. However, like I said, this one already reviewed by a lovely female fan of Oreo Oration . However, she added a special twist to it. She added a special category. I",

She added a special category . I did not do. I normally don't do with any other Oreo and I tell you without knowing what I'm about to get into, I'll never do it again. I have to grab a beer one second please. Why? Why she dunked it in a beer. Now she used a Michelob 64, I believe, maybe even a Michelob Lime, I can't recall. I don't know why she did that. So I'm going to use a Sapporo cuz if there's anything better that goes with Milk's Favorite Cookie, Japanese beer. Why she did this, maybe she's onto something. I didn't think that threw, maybe this is going to be the best thing I've ever done. So I'll slide it up here, slide that over there, do that Melroy one, two, three. That is disgusting. Not as bad as thought, not that bad. Weird, weird. Actually, I think the Oreo either one overpowered all the beer or it didn't absorb it. So if you're trying to",

So if you're trying to get kids to start drinking, but they don't like the taste of drinking, have them dunk Oreos in the drink. That's how it works, right? Woo. All right, final score. They're Thin Minty, they block alcohol taste. That's a lot actually. I don't usually ask for that out of a cookie. I'm happy they did that. 9.0. They're great. I think they're really, really good. Uh, are they better than a Thin Mint ? Of course not. Oreo is going to be chasing Thin Mints forever. That's why they have to beat these Girl Scouts and get them kidnapped all the time, but it's a good cookie all the same. So that's the way the cookie crumbles for Candy Cane Oreos.
