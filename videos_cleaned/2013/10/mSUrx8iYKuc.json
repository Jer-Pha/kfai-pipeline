Do you not edit your own things? No, I do. Okay, good. It's always a constant learning thing for me. I'm still young. YouTube channel. Of course, I'm Greg Miller. This is I Justine. Hello. Hi. You know, we're from this YouTube business. You're you're a big deal out there. You know, I don't know. I'm not sure. Well, we're about to talk about what a big deal every Wednesday and Friday here on Gregway. I answer one of your questions. You either email me, not email me, Twitter me, your link on YouTube since they took away video responses, which I'm not too thrilled about. I actually wasn't either because it was a great way to collect right videos from people. Maybe people didn't click on them, but sure was for me to get a video response question. It was easier, or you leave your comments below and we read it. This one comes from Darren MCN. Hi, Darren. He says,",

This one comes from Darren MCN. Hi, Darren. He says, hello, I just, no, he says, hey Greg, he didn't know you're going to be on. That's okay. Um, I have a question for a future episode. YouTube, why are you making these videos and what do you hope to achieve from them? You can already engage with people on Twitter, so what does YouTube offer that makes it compelling? I can't imagine the money right now is much to write home about. Damn, Darren, he's cutting deep right to the bone. Why the **** are you making these videos and wasting my time? Uh, for me, I Justine, it was a creative outlet. Uh, I had come to this point where I wanted to do something for myself, to create things that weren't just for IGN. Like, you know, I love IGN. I'm happy to work there, but it gets to be a much a bit much coming home and still working for the thing I was already doing. Yeah, it's true.",

I mean, I've even had random offers to go and work for these other companies and do things. I'm like, but wait, but but you're going to take away my YouTube channel . Why would, why don't understand why would I do that? Yeah, but yeah, mine isn't mine isn't about money for sure. God knows I'm not making anything off of this channel, but it's more about just the creative freedom to have, oh, this is what I want to make, horribly wrong comic book origin and go film it and now it's live. Know, no one get in my way. That's the point. You do what you want. Yeah, I think that's like everyone's kind of goal in life. How did you get started on this stuff ? Um, you've been doing it in a while, a really long time. Yeah, I feel like, geez, I made my first website, I was in sixth grade.",

But yeah, I just really always loved technology and I just started wanting to learn to edit and I mean, I was still editing. I went to school to be a graphic designer. Oh, yay, yay, which is good because now I can do most of my own design stuff and you have good is good. Yeah, my Greg, the screen we cut to not very impressive. That's okay, but that's what what YouTube is all about. You can do it yourself. You can do anything. It's about the the conversation between us. She gets it. She gets it. Yeah, that's the whole point. Like, you know, he's asking why we do, why I do this for me when I engage with people on Twitter, sure, but Twitter's 140 characters, which is one of the reasons I love it because you can get to the point you need to ask",

But sometimes I do want to rant and rave and explain for way too long about why Ben Affleck going to be being all right Batman and that's why it's here and then I get to have that conversation with you which means so much to me and Twitter is text, YouTube is video. I mean, you can't really compare the two. So who asked this question? Uh, Darren. Darren. So just think about that. It's not it's not some weird motive of me to line my pockets with anything because that ain't happening. I'm just here to talk to you as whenever I post the videos at 6:00 a.m., they go live. I'm in the comments at 6:00 a.m. for an hour. Wow, chatting with everybody cuz I can still do that. I'm sure you get too many comments to. I mean, I'll just do it throughout the day when I'm bored .

She's always charging her phone and she claims that she's not always charging her phone, but she's always charging it. Not charging it right now because using it. You over there with the little cord coming out because I need to be at 100% always. That's bad for your battery. You want to wear it. Leave my battery. Would you leave my battery Ling? I'm so sick of your. I'm just saying you're probably new to the iPhone. You don't understand how it works. I wanted to let you know exactly how bad it works. Listen, once it gets anywhere near 20%, like once it gets like 70, I'm like it's going to be at 2 0 very soon and then after 20 it does get red. Yeah, yeah, I know. I don't like it.

No, there is nothing after Short Circuit one. No, there was this awesome movie. Don't tell me this. Short Circuit 2 where stole some gems. He tricked Johnny 5. Johnny 5, I'm alive. Exactly. He Tri he tricks Johnny into thinking he's a good guy and helps him break in to steal some gems and jewels and then but then Johnny 5 catches him but he's bleeding. He's going to die and he dies there and they start shocking him back to life and he comes back to life. They make a goldplated version and he becomes the first the first robot citizen of the United States . This really this really happened. You know, but I love Short Circuit.
