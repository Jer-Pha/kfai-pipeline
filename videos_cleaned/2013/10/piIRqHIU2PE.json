Big time Video Game High School guy. Congratulations on the success you found with that thing. It's awesome. Thank you. Waiting for you to put a video game journalism class in there and have a Oh, we do have a joke. Oh, we have a video game journalism joke in there. Well, thanks for putting me in it somehow. I'll tell you about afterwards. I can't spoil the joke. Well, you can't, of course. Uh, remember every Wednesday and Friday here on my channel, you guys give me questions. I read them or put up your video, then we answer them. Today, Freddy's going to answer one with us. Uh, Crisis 327 writes in and says, \"I saw your video on Man of Steel before and you said you had some problems with it. Believe me, I have my problems, too, but I wondered what you thought.\" Um, what did you think of that Man of Steel, Freddy? I",

Believe me, I have my problems, too, but I wondered what you thought.\" Um, what did you think of that Man of Steel, Freddy? I thought it was visually impressive. I thought that Zack Snyder as always is a guy who really really knows how to direct like a visual thing like 300. Like I would argue 300 has more of like a visual cultural impact than like any movie than in the last like 20 years. Interesting. Cuz like you see a lot like speed ramp slow-mo stuff. Sure. Sure. Uh I thought Man of Steel was kind of a crappy movie where I had no idea what the deal was with Superman. Like what was him Superman as a character made zero sense to me. Like what was his thing? Like what was he? He was a Kansas farm boy and he's just trying to find his way in the world. But like but like so he's going to what? Like oil Derek and Oil Dereks when his dad said that he shouldn't but he but So there you go. Now we're getting into it right",

Now we're getting into it right away. That's the whole thing of like I didn't I did not appreciate uh Clark letting Jonathan die. I thought that was a dumb like I understand listen to your father kind of thing, but let you die or like not trade out for the dog or not move with super speed. Just get over there and be done with it. Something wrong with there. Well, it was it was the the just him as a character. I just didn't understand. Yeah. Like I understand why he did a lot of things I did. Even after it was just like one of the movies you go after, you just you listen to it's like that makes no sense. Why would he care? And then it's it was just I to me it was just like a complete mess. Yeah . That was the thing. I mean fun to look at. Exactly. I left the movie and I was like I'm a big Superman fan.

I was just like okay like that was a movie that was fine. It was fine. And then there's people who were like in in the same car as me who were like that was awesome. And people were like, \"That was the worst movie I've ever seen.\" And so I was right in the middle of I didn't have the energy to fight either of them. You know what I mean? Like I didn't spoilers of course. I didn't mind like you know the destruction of Metropolis and stuff. I'm like that for me when I read Invincible for the first time. Invincible was the first comic book to show like Mark's getting beat around. He's like stop we are killing thousands of people. Yeah. No, you're you're absolutely right because the problem with Superman as a character is that okay, you set up Invincibility as this guy, right? And the best Superman comics deal not",

And the best Superman comics deal not with him being invincible but deal with the repercussions in the mortal beings around. Like for example, take the small wheel fight. How much better and how much more intense and how much more dramatic would that fight have been if instead of him just like throwing people around and blowing through buildings if they have if like they're throwing like if if she's like, \"All right, fine. You this is your problem. You are willing to you know you're going to be handicapped by the fact that you need to save people. So here's what I'm going to do. when I throw people around, I'm gonna throw a car full of children into the air and I'm gonna fight you. So now Superman's like, \"Okay, I have to fight her and I need to save those kids at the same time.\" So it's like he has something else to do other",

And by the way, how many thousands of people died from Superman blowing through them through a building. He didn't do it on purpose on any that would really happen. That that was the thing I was arguing with people about is that so many people give me for liking Superman. Like he's so boring. He's invincible. He's this that he's that. He always saves the day. Like they're showing you here like what a realist realistic, you know, today Superman would be that no, you can't save everyone. That's not how this would really be. But see, but that I didn't get any of that from him. Sure. He didn't. Yeah. No, he was like other than the oil Derek thing. He was just like, uh, okay.

I had enjoyed their relationship so far. Whatever. Oh, she's chasing him. This that was now we're going to make out. I've never seen I've never seen a theater of grown men just all go and you brought it up too like that was like basically ground zero. It'd be like on September 11th you making out on ground zero. It's just like uh cheesy line. I I heard it just keeps getting it only applies to humans which which I'm not. And like in the background it's like there are within Superman's like line of hearing there's probably 300 people buried under that rubble slowly being crushed to death as he makes out with Lo Lane.

Like I want to I want someone to take that scene and then in the background like Compin just people screaming and carrying their limbs and digging their loved ones out of the rubble like a guy like holding his kid crying and then meanwhile he's they're both sitting there like hey so uh kind of like you. Yeah. And just in the background blurry you just hear screams and cuz that's what it was just so ridiculous.

I guess Superman was that was cool. That was cool. That was cool, right? Yeah, that was cool. And then Fast and Furious it was like Vin Diesel got his family back. Yeah. Like everybody was so with it was even though it was so basic and even though it was so like you know it's not a complex cool thing. is just like Vin Diesel wants a family and he gets it by the end of these six movies and it's like you're with it all the way and from that standpoint as a piece of storytelling that emotionally involves you as an audience Fast and Furious 6 kicks the snot out Superman. Yeah. Sorry. I mean like the one thing I wanted more from Superman was that emotional stuff and when he kills Zod at the end it's not deserved.",

I was like I liked that scene but that's saying I like that scene disconnecting all the things of the fighting in the street. There was no leadup to it. There's no, it wasn't a deserved scene. And also, it's like, come on, family. Like, let's leave. Dive out of the way. I'm sitting there being like, he's like, no, don't blow them up with your heat vision. The family's like, oh gosh, we're about to. It's like, just, you know what? If you're not going to run, then I don't know what to tell you because I'm just saying like I would rant.
