I'm sorry, what happened if Greg tickles you? Oh God, ****. It's really painful. That was submitted by my mom . I hate being tickled. I hate it. Oh God, why do you hate it so much? I, so this is one, why did you scream like I was going inside you is the better question I think. Oh God , I'm so sensitive about being tickled. Why Cheryl knows, like even if you like touch me in certain place, like very delicately touch, like I can't be touched like on my chest or stomach, like just normally, really? I can do it myself, but if someone",

I can do it myself, but if someone else just like, it's like it makes me like want to jump around. I hate it. So here's, here's an interesting story. I'm, I'm, we're going to get, I thought I was going to tickle you, you wouldn't react and we would end the episode. Little did I know you'd scream like a hot poker. So one of, one of the things that I hated being tickled when I was a kid and like my sisters and my brother used to like tickle me and like **** with me or whatever. Yeah, and uh, I used to have recurring nightmares about a monster called the tickly monster when I was a kid who used to come into my dreams. He was a man. All so here's this, this is the most **** up part of it all. We had these like in our kitchen, we had these portraits of like all my, my dad and my mom collected antiques, so they were like old like hand pain things",

We had these like in our kitchen, we had these portraits of like all my, my dad and my mom collected antiques, so they were like old like hand pain things like dishes and **** like and there were just random people, right? And there was this guy with a mustache, like a curly mustache and he was the tickly monster in my dreams and years this thing was on the wall and I was horrified of it, but like no one understood quite why until I like finally divulged the secret of the, so there was this guy like even when I was in my crib, like I remember this goes back like I, this is like my earliest memories Jesus of this guy dressed in like khakis and like he had like this weird mustach, like handlebar mustache and he would just tickle me and it was like and I would wake up all **** up and start crying and my mom and my dad would come into my room and like get me out of my crib or out of my bed and like I'd be telling them that the tickly monster was",

Like because they were like, who is, who is this guy? Like this I was like, he's a stranger, he has a mustache, whatever. And my family interpreted this as me being that anyone with a mustache was a stranger . Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this all wrapped up in this tickling thing that I like and I still don't like being touched like in a, in a soft and delicate way because it tickles me. You sound a delicate or you sound like a sensitive lover. This must be great. So, so it's like, yeah, like you know, like someone's like, you know, like",

I that was just, it's rare that I step on a land mine, a Colin landmine of information I didn't know you didn't really want to know. We went somewhere today with the tickly, where is the tickly monster now? He's never been back. Like I haven't had him, no, I don't mean like the dream, I mean the plate. Oh, the pl, I don't know, it's just somewhere in a box in my at my parents attic some cuz we moved out of that house and yeah, um, but he's never been like I probably had a tickly monster dream last in'91 or'92 probably.

No, I like it was always, it always ended up me just like being horrified and crying basically. There was no fighting the tickly monster. He was a grown man. I was, you're a grown man. I guess that's why doesn't come back anymore. Yeah, well, well, you know, now he knows I, I use that term grown man lightly or whatever. Yeah, yeah, I'll just kill him now, just get out of my crib. But when I was I couldn't, he was over, he overwhelmed me. Yeah, and then I would go get up for breakfast in the morning and his **** plate would be on the table next we I'd be like looking behind me being, you know, and I it was too embarrassed to tell anyone. Wow, wow. Did you ever think of just breaking the plate, like blaming it on like you're, you're going go in there with your Nerf dart and you hit you, you break it with your hand and you I hit it with a Nerf dart.
