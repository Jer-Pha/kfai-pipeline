Every Wednesday and Friday here on Gregway , I answer one of your questions left in the YouTube comments below or sent to me on Twitter. Today's question comes from neither of those places because I don't care about the rules. Instead, my girlfriend Christine asked if our dog Portillo could beat up Chop the dog from Grand Theft Auto 5. Let's find [Music] out. [Music] What? No, no , not your Lobster. No, little one. No, get Chop, P. No, that's no Lobster in Grand Theft Auto 5. So there you have it. What's your question, ladies and gentlemen? Let me know in the comments below or hit me up on Twitter and then check back every Wednesday and Friday for a new Gregway.",
