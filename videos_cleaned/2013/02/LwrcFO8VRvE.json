I'm Greg, and while you are out there trying to pick up chicks all the time on that damn two-seater motorcycle you got, the fine people at Oreo are making endless variations to Milk's Favorite Cookie. So every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like this video, subscribe to my YouTube channel, share it with your friends , please, or I will, I swear God, stop making these videos if more people don't start watching them. All right, I'm glad we're on the same pitch. Today we're reviewing Golden Birthday Cake Oreos . Birthday Cake Golden Oreos. They don't say golden anywhere. This was, this was a topic of conversation I had with some of the kids on Twitter. Follow me on Twitter. Anyway, you know, do you want all the birthday cakes put together being reviewed the same way because they, they don't differentiate? I'll do the differentiating for you. All right, Nabisco Oreo, sort it out, figure",

All right, Nabisco Oreo, sort it out, figure out what you're doing here, otherwise Greg Miller's got to come in and mark it for you. Um, Birthday Cake Oreo, again, if you weren't paying attention on Wednesday's show, Canada had these things first. They were a test market from Christie, whatever the hell that means. Uh, but Canada sucks, just kidding, please share this video with people in Canada. Um, every oration begins with a patented first look. You little lift tab, tear it open. Oh, another good looking first look for these Birthday Cake Oreos. Look at, better than, if you breathe in too deep, you immediately get dizzy because there's no oxygen coming out of these, it's just smell particles. Oh, now my mouth's watering anyways. Uh, they look better than their, uh, black brethren. They aren't, they were all broken down over here on the side, the chocolate",

They aren't, they were all broken down over here on the side, the chocolate cookies, white ones looking good. Of course, I'm concerned, are these going to be too sweet? Only way to go, the second part of an Oreo Oration, uh, the taste test. Look at how, that's a big ass Oreo taste test. Oh, look at this, switch it back to first look. They got, they did the thing I don't understand, the Oreo machine. How does the Oreo machine go through and somehow switch up Oreos like this where it's like, oh, well, you put the top on the bottom. You see this is, well, you see what it's happening, put like that. I got the Oreo indentation all wrong. Thanks for watching the show. This one screwed up. Whoa, whoa, look at this, they're all screwed up. It's like a rejected thing. I can't believe I paid good money for this Nabisco. Anyways, taste test, let's see how that goes. Oh yeah, wow, it's like, I believe it was Revenge",

Don't judge a book by its cover. This, these taste better than the chocolate Birthday Cake Oreos. The, you know, shortbread cookie I talk about so much here on Oreo ration offsetting that bite on the tongue. It's not there at all. This is a delicious cookie , big, big fan already. Let's see how it pairs with milk. Get out of here, bastards. All we're, oh, that one's broken. Do the dunk test here. One, two, three, that's for you, Justin Mel. Mhm, mhm, yeah, this is the cookie I'm getting behind big time. There, show to the top of the charts, I'll tell you right now. All right, the shortbread cookie sucking in the milk very well, something the shortbread struggle with sometimes, very suckable. This",

All right, the shortbread cookie sucking in the milk very well, something the shortbread struggle with sometimes, very suckable. This time around it is liquefied the cream then too, making it taste more like frosting, the consistency of frosting. If you, if you walk into stores all the time and see vegetables and you're like, goddamn, I wish these vegetables were frosting, that was a little bit liquidy there it is. Don't eat vegetables anymore, eat Golden Birthday Cake Oreos. Um, we got to do twist test, a formality at this point, I think, right? These things could probably go murder my parents and I'd be like, yep, these are still delicious. That was a great twist, got over here, twist, brilliant, perfect. You're getting everything you want out of these guys, man. I'm on a 20 point scale, remember now? Of course, some people don't understand what that means. It means one, 1.5, two, 2.5, that's high score. Ones would be bad. We're, we're way higher than one",

Ones would be bad. We're, we're way higher than one here . These are better hands down than chocolate birthday cake, which I gave a 9.0. So now we got to decide what qualms do I have with this cookie? That's the problem, ladies and gentlemen. We are on the precipice of just, oh my God, what do I do? I got to, I got to go back, I got to see what's [Applause] happening. A 10, a perfect 10, ladies and gentlemen. These cookies are awesome. Holy, oh my God, what do you think will go, oh my God, you're so good. Hold on a second, someone write to Mr. Nabisco and tell him, God bless you. Wow, well, that's the way the cookie crumbles for Golden Birthday Cake Oreos. They're delicious, a perfect 10. I think what do you think? Uh, leave a video response in the comments below is your review so then I can share it with the world. Everyone can see you eat the cookies, say what you think of them.",

Uh, then let me know what Oreos I'm missing in the comments below, just shout them out, tell me where you are so I can go find them, not like your home address, but like, you know, what state you're in, what country you're in, that way I have a way to find these Oreos. Until then, I'll be back every Wednesday and Friday with a new review, but hey, keep on dunking. [Music] So good. [Music]",
