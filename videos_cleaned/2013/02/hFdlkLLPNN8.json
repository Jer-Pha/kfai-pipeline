I'm Greg Miller and while you were out living your life, basking in the sunshine or whatever state you live in, the fine people at Oreo were making endless variations of Milk's Favorite Cookie. So every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like the video and subscribe to my YouTube channel. Today we're reviewing Oreo Cakesters. Well, they got out of my hand there. This is not at all what our normal Oreo Oration goes like, right ladies and gentlemen? We'll stick to the same pattern. First look, where you got to open it up and see how they're packaged and stuff. Well, this is actually impressive already. Look at that, they're all lined up in a in a little conga line of Oreo Cakesters. We'll get right into one. They're prepackaged . If I really wanted to, I bet I could go out and sell these on the street. I won't. That's probably frowned upon. Two cakes in every",

That's probably frowned upon. Two cakes in every package, if you're wondering. Crack it open. Now I guess we're into a real first look. You got a little bit of a gooey gooey open there. I'm not a not a fan anything I open that's immediately gooey like that, but whatever. And then we're going to open them up. Wow. Well, look at these guys. The first look continues. They're gooey on the sides, Oreo looking. It's you know, basically you're trying at home to make an Oreo, you make an Oreo cake, you put them together and whatever. This looks like all we're going to jump right into taste now. See how these little guys taste. I was expecting not to like them, but I would say I want to go as far as say I like them. I want to eat them again. But you remember, you remember SnackWell's? These SnackWell's cakes were a big thing back in the day, the makers of fat-free",

These SnackWell's cakes were a big thing back in the day, the makers of fat-free SnackWell's devil's food cookies apologize for the short supply. Meanwhile, keep enjoying the other variety. They kind of got that cake feeling , the the SnackWell's cake, but it's also tastes like that SnackWell's thing where you bite into it, you're like what am I even eating? What is this thing? It's got that grainy chocolate thing to it. I'm not let's see how it goes with milk. See if that changes my mind. No, not not liking this aftertaste either. So we'll do the triple dunk, one, two, three. You can just see it splurging milk out there. No, now it's not even to the you know how I like you watch the show Oreo Oration, subscribe to us here on YouTube. You know that I like the fact that a traditional chocolate sucks in that milk gets a bit soggy. This is too soggy, not a fan, but it's not bad. It's not a bad cookie. I",

It's not a bad cookie. I want to say it's bad. Uh, of course next is the twisting test. God only knows how this abomination is going to fare. It's not cuz it's an abomination, but you know, it's whatever. It's not an Oreo. This is just sa oh man, it's not it's just that is not an Oreo ladies and gentlemen. The Cakester is not an Oreo, as I'm sure you knew and were well aware that this is not an Oreo. So H how do I review not an Oreo on the Oreo Oration, whatever the show is called scale? I'm going to go 4.5, not a fan. Uh, it's not well, it's not good. That's it's poor for sure. It's well, you shouldn't squeeze them in your hands. I guess I squeeze these in my hand, but presentation's all off the map. The taste isn't that great, after taste isn't that great. Uh, it doesn't pair well with milk and you can't twist them worth a damn. So",
