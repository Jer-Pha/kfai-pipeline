Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg and this is my roommate, Colin. Now, sometimes Colin says crazy stuff. So every Tuesday and Thursday, I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, throw it at him. We talk it out for your amusement. If you like that, like the video , subscribe to us here, then leave a comment below telling us what you wanted us to talk about. We're here all the time, right, Colin? Are you ready? Yes. Your first topic that you have no idea about: Why Google is the worst thing ever, submitted by Laser Death Cannon. Thank you very much. Uh, K, why is Google the worst thing ever? Do you agree with this being the worst thing ever? It's not the worst thing ever. I mean, you can think about, you know, fascism would probably be on that list. You know, Kansas may maybe on that list. Uh, the Soviet Union from after World War II until the",

Uh, the Soviet Union from after World War II until the collapse, maybe it would be, you know, so there's a few things on that list that would be worse than Google, but Google's maybe one of the scariest things . Yeah, you see, it's trendy now to be scared of Google as they buy all these things and they want you to log in and all the things. Colin was at the Forefront of being scared of Google. He, I mean, I met him six years ago at Denny's. He was talking about how evil Google was. It's true. Why are you so scared of Google? Um, so Google has, Google's a great service. I mean, like the search engine itself is is brilliant. Everyone uses it. I use it every day. Um, and I think that they've become scary because they do everything. And so now now you have a Google name, you know, you sign in with your Google name and and suddenly you're you you're using like their video",

They know everything about you. Yeah, they know all the dirty **** you search for on Google. They read all and spider all of your emails. So they know how to advertise to you. They, uh, you know , they're logging everything. They don't delete. If you didn't know, YouTube owned by Google, this is happening to you right now. Yeah, yeah. YouTube's another great example. I mean, you're going to get the oration videos, you're going to get lose weight videos. It's all coming your way.

I don't sign in when I use Google stuff. I don't sign into YouTube. I don't sign into Google when I search for things . Thanks for leaving a comment below. Yeah, I can't can't do it. Can't do it. Uh, so it's not that Google's bad. Like, I don't think Google is inherently bad and I don't think Google has any nefarious motive at all, but you have to understand that their server Farms all over the world are filled with all of your data and it's not what they do with the data that's necessarily nefarious, it's what if someone gets into it. Yeah, you know, a lot of people don't realize that I think it was in 2004, 2005, uh, someone hacked an AOL or or a huge search cache from AOL was released and, uh, it was huge, it was huge. You could search it and spider it. There's like, you know, look through it and there was no names in it, but then people",

There's like, you know, look through it and there was no names in it, but then people realized that if someone vanity search themselves, you can can line up their Anonymous user ID with their anonymous search, then search their ID and find everything they search for. And imagine something with Google where maybe it's encrypted, but they have all of your emails and they read them. Like I said, they read them. It's not like just just email, like they're going through your emails and they have all your search terms since 2004 and all this sh I mean, like it's it's horrifying what could happen to people if any of that stuff was compromised. So it's not a matter of Google being, you know, bad. Google has a great service and everyone uses it, but you have to understand that Google is getting really big and and invasive.

It's one of those things where I feel like I should be scared, Colin, but I'm not scared. I like Google. I feel like they're they they they speak to me with all this technology, they make it easy. I hope they go as far as to end up replacing all you know, sign in with Facebook. I don't want to sign in with Facebook, just let me sign in with Google. I'm already logged into go. It sucks that Google Plus isn't more right? That's the one, right? The social network that it isn't more successful, right? Because I would rather that just replace Facebook and it's just an easy thing. But I understand what you're I here's the weird thing is that I've I've seen this story play out before. It was called called Batman Brother Eye. Om project Batman made this satellite called Brother Eye that he put in the sky and it knew Batman launched his own satellite.

Yeah, yeah, he's Bruce Wayne, he's got a lot of money, he's got a lot of tech. So he launches this satellite, right? And it's got all it knows all the information on all the superheroes, how to beat him and all this other stuff. And then it becomes sentient and he wants to like, you know, take over the world and like it was this giant thing and the people were very the superheroes Community very offended that Batman like knew how to beat Wonder Woman and he put it in in a robot that you know, store it in the satellite. I'm just more fascinated that Batman launched his own. Batman is he has like this rocket technology. Sure, because you have to understand lift necessary to get a rocket off the ground away from Earth is is substantial, but also to lift the satellite.

You think three Donald Trumps couldn't get a satellite off the earth? I don't know. I mean, he he also got permission from the government to do this. No, probably not. I mean, well, Wayne Enterprises, they have all these contracts obviously with the Army. I'm sure some point in there you could you could fin angle your way. They say, hey, take this up General Kaiser. General Kaiser takes it right up. Um, yeah, so I don't I I don't think Google like, you know, YouTube's awesome. Uh, you know, Google's awesome. Um, I you know, if I didn't like those things, I would tell you, you know, that. So I mean , that's that's Colin speaking from the heart about Straight Talk from Colin.

They're doing a lot of things, but it's just I would like Google a lot better and I think it would be a lot more trustworthy, um, if they just deleted all your data. Like they're very interested for obvious reasons in your data because they want to know exactly how they can make as much money as possible on you and I don't blame them, but people I don't think think about these things and if imagine if Google, imagine if you just you have a Google like a Gmail account, you use it for 20 years, you're on Google every day searching for ****, you go to YouTube, you look at videos, you do all these things and then suddenly down the line like your **** just exists on a server somewhere.

It's just like that's personal and private stuff that that's your information and if Google really did care most about the consumer, they would delete that kind of data, but, um, they care most about making money like any Corporation does and and, uh, yeah, what about the argument I have nothing to hide? I have I have nothing to hide. If when I'm when I'm want to masturbate on the internet, I open the incognito tab. That doesn't matter. They're still saving it. Well, it says Incognito, so I assume no one sees it. Uh, yeah, no one can see it on your computer, but, um, like the data stream on the Internet is exactly the same.

You're not a terrorist, but like it's like what if innocent people get caught up in this whole thing, you know, I mean, it's it's that's the most concerning thing.
