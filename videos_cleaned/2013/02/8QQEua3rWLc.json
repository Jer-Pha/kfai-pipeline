I'm Greg Miller, and while you are out living your life, surfing in them waves, uh, the fine people at Oreo were making endless variations to milk's favorite cookie. So every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like the video, then subscribe to my YouTube channel. Today we're reviewing, God help us all, Golden Oreo Cakesters. Now, I'm sure you know all about Oreo Oration. You saw last, last show on Wednesday there. I, I reviewed regular Oreo Cakesters and did not enjoy them. They left a very bad taste in my mouth. I gave them a four, five on the review scale. Of course, we go zero to 10, 10 being the best, zero being the worst. I might have overrated them'cause it's just sticking to my craw. We'll see if I have to adjust my scoring here at all. Of course, we start with the first look. Once again, a good first look. I like the packaging. I like the fact you open up and there's just, it's like,",

I like the fact you open up and there's just, it's like glowing. It's a bunch of golden tickets, gold Oreo tickets. That's what I want. Get another one here, another Oreo Cakester. Again, I could sell these on the street, I bet. Doesn't say anything about don't sell them individually, so bonus for me. Oh, you tear them open. Now look, these aren't all smooshed and disgusting like the regular Oreo Cakesters were. This is random sampling. Oh, wow, there's not, there isn't the frosting all over them. That's, or all over the sides like there were on the other one. Let's take a smell. I was yelled at by a producer after we filmed the last one that I did not smell them. Uh, they smell good. They smell like the shortbread cookie of the regular Golden Oreo. Uh, now we move to Oreo Orations, uh, second test, the tastes. Of course, I already can tell you the, the texture is better. It's not,",

Of course, I already can tell you the, the texture is better. It's not as soft and gross as last was. Hmm, definitely a market improvement over the original Oreo Cakester, the Golden Oreo Cakester. I guess this is something what it is right there. It's golden cake. It tastes like golden cake. You're, you bite into it and it tastes like a little golden cake with some cream in the middle. That's a real thing, whereas this little chocolate cake bastard that was the Oreo Cakester before, granted there's chocolate cake. I'm not saying there's no chocolate cake, but the, the taste, the snack, well taste, it didn't work. This is actually working. I'll take another bite. I show you I don't hate them. I'll also spit it all over the place'cause what the hell. Okay, let's see how these guys pair with milk. Of course, milk and Oreo go together like milk and Oreos. I don't know. Here we go. We're going to",

I don't know. Here we go. We're going to dunk it one, two, three. Now here's the thing, it's good. The taste, of course, the milk ping. I don't think it's a dessert I personally eat. I've talked about this before, not a huge fan of that vanilla creamy sweetness. I like, I like the offset of the chocolate cookie on normal Oreos, not, not over the hell these things are, but it's not bad, not bad at all. Um, now we're going to go to the twisting thing. We all remember how this, this went like last time. I'm not expecting much . Crack it open. Twist it. Yeah, oh no. I mean, these aren't meant to be twisted, obviously. They're Cakesters. They are not Twisters. I would imagine a Twister. I mean, I guess you can't cake a cookie either. Let's get down to brass taxs though. What am I going to score these guys? Four, five for the last Oreo Cakesters. These light years ahead of",

I'll go flat seven. They're good. They're, they're a good, uh, substitute if you're in some hood that doesn't have Oreos left and right, but for some reason there's a wall full of Cakesters, buy the Golden Cakesters, you, you'll enjoy them. So that is the way the cookie crumbles for the Golden Oreo Cakesters. But what do you think? Leave your review as a video response below, then like the video, subscribe to my channel. Now here's the big question, ladies and gentlemen, are there other Oreos out there I am missing for review? I am sure there are , and what I need you to do is go leave those Oreos in the comments below, tell me where you are, where I can get them, then share this video with your friends so I can",
