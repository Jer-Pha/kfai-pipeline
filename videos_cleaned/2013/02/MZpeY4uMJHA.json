I'm Greg, and while you are out playing them damn video games, the fine people at Oreo were making endless variations of Milk's Favorite Cookie. So every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to my channel, share it with your friends. Today we're reviewing Birthday Cake Oreos. This is, we have been getting Oreo Oration been on the air for a while now. Since episode one, people talking to me about these damn Birthday Cake Oreos and I'm like, that's great, I can't find them anywhere. People started sending them in and then I'd get them. I get this broke down, broke ass package of birthday Oreos like, okay great. What? And I'm like, wait a second, it says Christie up here. It's got the Christie. I look on the back, it's talking about this is, these are Canadian Oreos. So they, that's what you get Canada, you, you're just America's hat and for years Oreo has been",

So they, that's what you get Canada, you, you're just America's hat and for years Oreo has been testing flavors on you to give us the big, the big business right here. Uh, never had a Birthday Cake Oreo. We're about to find out. Every episode of Oreo Oration begins with the patented First Look. Let's tear it open here, see what we got. Ah, oh, we got some broken ones at the top, but look at that, look at, you got the confetti frosting in there, all sorts of stuff. Whoa, doctor, I can tell you before I got close to them, they got the smell, they got the bouquet we're always talking about here in Oreo Oration. Uh, it's very, uh, candy corn like. Remember the candy corn Oreo? Here's a downside I think to the Candy Corn Oreo, an overpowering just aroma of basically frosting. It smells like you are in a bakery. It smells like you in a bakery where a bunch of frosting has fallen out of cakes and you're like, why did you",

It smells like you in a bakery where a bunch of frosting has fallen out of cakes and you're like, why did you put the frosting in the cakes? It goes on the cakes and they just say, I don't know. Uh, the Candy Corn Oreo, of course, we talked about it had that frosting smell. Colin Moriarty from another YouTube show called The Conversation with Colin said it smelled like a cake factory in here. These definitely smell like that. So let's get one out here. Uh, first look, the Oreos, they're a little bit broken. I'm not going to fault them for, oh, they got a good texture to them. They got a good, I can feel the ridges on them. I enjoy that in an Oreo texture. All right, so, uh, next part of the oration, of course, taste, overwhelming smell. Let's see how that affects the taste buds. Whoa. It's, whoa. You got to ask St., how much do you like cake frosting? Like, you know, if you took the little the Pillsbury thing and you, you scoop it up, you",

Like, you know, if you took the little the Pillsbury thing and you, you scoop it up, you know, you put on the cake. Give me a sec here. It's, it's defin, it's definitely super sweet. It's got the cake frosting thing, but then a bit on the back of your tongue there, the aftertaste, a dullish, metal-ish. I don't, it's, it's not bad. H yeah , okay, there, there's stuff going on here. It's definitely got that frosting. It's got that canned frosting taste. They've done a great job of replicating that and putting in an Oreo. Next part of an Oreo oration, of course, the twist test. Let's see how this works out. Oh, two out of three, of course, before I say it's really good, but that was a perfect, perfect break. Do another one here. Perfect. Look at that. They know what they're doing. The big thing too, remember, we've seen it with the Berry Burst , we've seen it with these other kind of crazy flavors of Oreos that",

The big thing too, remember, we've seen it with the Berry Burst, we've seen it with these other kind of crazy flavors of Oreos that they fall apart. None of them have fallen apart here. I don't have any, I don't have any loose, I don't have any pre-twisted. Obviously, I'm, I'm buying the Oreo. Let me twist it myself. That's what I want. It's doing well. Let's see how it pairs with milk. Oh, I was, that was a daredevil pour if you didn't notice right from the top. I was like, whatever, pour it from four feet high, who cares? Pair some milk. One, two, three . That's a man who loves, was the twist test. That's a good pair. That goes really well. That actually takes away some of that bite I was talking about on the, on the back of your tongue. I like that a lot. Okay, uh, clearly I'm a big fan. Let's go final score here. What am I going to score Birthday K? I think they're a slam dunk, nine, 9.0 right there. Uh, you know, obviously Berry Burst, that's the 95,",

Uh, you know, obviously Berry Burst, that's the 95, that's the the litmus test, so good. Uh, because I don't think at the aftertaste, there's nothing there. A lot of people are going to love him or hate him based on that L that taste they leave in your mouth, these Birthday Cake Oreos. Uh, I love them though. I'm going to, I'm going to eat the hell out of this whole goddamn package when you're not looking. So thanks, that's the way the cookie crumbles for Birthday Cake Oreos. But what do you think? I'm sure you've tried them. Like I said, y'all been annoying me in the comments forever about this.
