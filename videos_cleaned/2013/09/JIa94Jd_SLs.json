You're a Jets fan. The NFL's kick back up here. Booy. They're throwing the football out there, the old pig skin. Kill, kill. Um, New York Jets, how they gonna, what's the season going to be like this year for? Oh my God, I don't know. I, I had a dream. I, I said I'd talk about on Twitter. Yeah, I had a dream .

And, uh, we, they were playing the Patriots at home and the crowd was going wild and they went, they were going in the, uh, they were going in the halftime, uh, up 283, yeah, against Patriots. Good dream. That's, that's, um, a lot of running touchdowns, I would assume. Proba Sanchez isn't winging him in. No, no. I, I think the Jets this year, um, four or five wins. Um, now here's the thing about it. Let's dial it back so we get to a little more wide audience, right? You are going to cheer for the Jets and watch every game and you are expecting nothing from them, right? Talk a little bit about sports fandom. What draws you to the Jets? Why are you like this?

Like my, my, um, I was like a huge, you said like when we met, I used to wear a Yankee hat every day, right? Like, and, uh, for like two, the first two years we knew each other . I actually lost that hat and that's why I just never got another one. Um, my family is like really, really into the Yankees and, um, like my sister, my brother, like my brother wears like all sorts of obscure like, like AAA and dou a like hats from like their system, you know, Columbus and Trenton and, um, like Japanese baseball like hats when like when we got Matsui.

Um, so and it also stems from the Dodgers and stuff like that. I don't know if you know that whole the Brooklyn Dodgers thing, you know. So anyway, uh, so we're really into the Yankees and we're, you know, we, we love hockey mostly because I played it . Um, I got into the Jets when I was younger, like I started watching football like in middle school. Um, and, uh, you know, the Jets are geographically, uh, they play in Shay Stadium, so they, they are, and these play at the, um, the polar grounds on Long Island back in the day. So they are Long Island's team, but there are Giants fans and Jets fans and they're Jets fans in the city and stuff, so doesn't really matter.

Um, and I was just like, you know what, like, um, I'm going to be a Jets fan. Like, like, you know, nth, 10th grade, I'm like, I'm going to root for the Jets because the Giants were really good at the time. Remember the Giants went, did the Super Bowl, they played the Ravens and stuff like that. I'm like, it's corny if I'm going to start rooting for a team. I never really cared about the Giants, like they just never really did it for me. So you don't want to be that bad wagon. Yeah, yeah. So I'm like, I'm going to be a Jets guy. Yeah. Um, and so I played in a band with, uh, these guys, Brian Myers and, uh, Christian Buaro. And, um, and they're, they're huge Jets fans and they really started to get me even more into the Jets.

So like my fandom didn't really start as it was until as it is right now until like late high school and by fascinating. I was assuming this was an inboard thing. I don't think I've ever heard this story. No. And by the time I got to college, um, that's like when I really, really, really got into like really like watched every game and like got really crazy about it. Now I remember, remember like, you know, I always talk about like the old one in 15 season and like, like I remember those things, but those things didn't pain me as much as like the other contemporary jet living through it.

So like I like had like a West Coast team and an East Coast team and then when I got into high school I was like like he wasn't on the team anymore and I was like , you know, now I'm like, you know, my allegiance is totally with the Isles again and stuff like that.

Um, obviously I wasn't there in'69 when they won, you know, Super Bowl 3 when they won and and and you know, I didn't see the Sack Exchange in the 80s and like, you know, those great teams, um, those great Jets teams and in fact, I still think that the the most promising Jets team other than the 98 championship team was as hard as it is to believe the 2009, 2010 Jets, you know, the back to back championship games.

I was like, oh, you know, they're turning into the Buffalo Bills of the championship game, right? Um, well that was the thing with the Bears, right? When I when I when I was watching, you know, I when the Bears made the Super Bowl, I drove in to Chicago to be downtown and my thought process was if they win, I get to be part of this huge celebration. If they lose, I'll be around other depressed Bears, but I'd gotten my job at IGN literally a couple days before that, so I was on the cloud nine, so I don't even remember the Super Bowl hurting.
