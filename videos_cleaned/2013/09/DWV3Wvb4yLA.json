            "text": "What's up everybody, welcome to another episode of Gregway. Of course, every Wednesday and Friday I answer one of your questions whether it be a comment or a video you put up on YouTube and then tweet at me and then I answer it from there. However, no, no nobody to call out in particular, a whole bunch of you have been giving me the old tweets, the old comments asking me about uh a thing called Mighty Wings. Everybody knows, I hope by now at least by this body of work and then I am the preeminent chicken wing expert here on the internet. I think you're hard pressed to find someone who loves Buffalo Wings and chicken wings more than I do. And of course now McDonald's has decided to throw their hat in the ring with Mighty Wings. I decided I'll finally eat them to tell you what I think of them. You know you've made a bad McDonald's decision when the bag is a double deck er, when there's this much McDonald's in. I should point out I don't hate McDonald's. Uh I don't eat fast food however with any regularity.",

Uh I don't eat fast food however with any regularity. Now immediately I can see that I asked for spicy spicy sauce. They gave me, oh here they are, they gave me some hot mustard, not a fan of that. Five pieces are in every box that appears. Um I bought two'cause I figured even if they're bad I'm going to love them. Mighty Wings, so here we go. First look on Mighty Wings. This isn't the return oration open. Oh no, they're like, I don't like to look at those. Uh there's fried chicken, they smell like fried chicken but they don't look good. That mean like that one doesn't look good. I don't want that. I'm not going to eat that one. Let's see if this one looks any better. Okay these look better at first glance, those look more like okay I might eat these. I'll push those away. I'll tell you right now big problem, not enough drummies of no maybe no drummies just the just the",

I'll tell you right now big problem, not enough drummies of no maybe no drummies just the just the uh I mean obviously if you didn't know you know every part of a chicken wing when you get these things that look like drumsticks not really drumsticks that's the second part of a chicken wing they connect to make one so I don't have any drummies to show you but imagine this is a drummy and they go like that that's what a chicken wing is. Um I'm going to go wh straight up chicken. Now a lot of people were impressed too that Mighty Wings were here or whatever. I remember being in Chicago that these were a thing back in the day. I think maybe we're at test market or maybe they were on McDonald's all the time I don't know. I'm going to dive into this guy. I'll try the old patented two he's really hot. I'll try this guy.

Okay it's got a good breading on it really salty of course obviously it's fried covered in sodium. Let's dump some spicy buffalo here on it. Now of course this entire meal got a bottle of water with it. $1089, Wings themselves, 10 wings $8.99. This is a spicy sauce is very orange, tastes good, tastes like Buffalo sauce. Pour it on this guy here. Oh it's not really runny though it's pretty thick. I like I like a I like a more vine gary based sauce you know what I'm saying. No they're really greasy, look how greasy they are glistening with grease. I don't like that one bit. Um yeah I wasted some money here. I'm hungry too. I'm going to try one more just for the thing but I'm not enjoying myself. That one was all better no no so there you go I ate what three and I'm done I don't want the rest it's seven I'm tossing out the here's the thing and like oh well I do like this it's time for bone in",
