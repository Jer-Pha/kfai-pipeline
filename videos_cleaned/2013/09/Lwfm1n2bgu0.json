What are you making face? What are you making? What you got against Bagels? You know there another food you didn't have for 35 years. Actually tell you truth, I don't think I had a bagel until I was in college. It might have been after college that I had my first bagel. I might have been living in um in the Bay Area. I might have been living in Oakland or Berkeley or something and you're like what is this? This Bread's G bad. This doughnut doesn't look right. What's wrong with this stuff?

No, go to New York for an awesome bagel and if you're in San Francisco, this is a this is a trick. This is a pro tip from Greg Miller and this is just around the IG office obviously because I don't get around to eat lot of bagels, but you want to get a New York style Bagel, a boiled Bagel . We've talked about it. I'll link it here so we don't block Dave. This is no where you are you cannot get a bagel as good as a New York bagel and do you know why? The water, the water they boil them in speci the water and that's that's what New York water comes right out of the sewer thereon. But if you're in San Francisco, there's the Great American Bagelry.
