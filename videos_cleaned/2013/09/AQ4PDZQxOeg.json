Welcome to another episode of Gregway where each and every Wednesday and Friday you tweet me a question, you leave it in the comments below, or you send me the preferred video response and I answer it here in front of dozens of YouTube viewers. Well, today's question comes from Bless the Music TV. Let's see what he, she, or it has to say. All right, Greg, I think I have the perfect question. If you can't answer it, I'll give you a secondary option. Heads up, if you say you have the perfect question and then give me an immediate out, probably not the perfect question. The first question is, who's your top five favorite people at IGN? Um, and I guess why I give a story explaining the reason. Do you have co-workers? I'm not going to be like, oh man, these the five I like, everybody else get the **** out of here. Number one, Sam Clayborn. If you can't answer it or you want to play the dad card or I love all my kids equally kind of thing, then what's your top five favorite moments?",

That's a really good one. I like that. Well, let's go. We're going to go off top of my head and so that mean like I don't have a list like right, like you ask me my five favorite foods, I got, I'm ready to go. You already know, Wings, Pizza, Bagels, broccoli, Sushi, done answered . My top five moments at IGN though, wow. You said favorite mo, favorite IGN moments, favorite moments from IGN. So I'm going to limit it to like things that are happening at IGN, right? Not like, you know, well, I don't even know what the hell else would happen there that I would have it. But not like, oh, the, well, I guess I could count the first time I see like GTA or something, but like, h no, we're not going to, we'll do stuff that involves people, but in no particular order, no particular order, all.",

All right, so one of the stories is this, uh, it was post E3 one year. It's the same year where Colin and I got drunk and took off our shirts and sat around this, uh, IGN table and banged on the center of the table and talked about how much we love IGN. And, uh, but you've heard the story probably on Beyond before if, if you're a dedicated IGN fan, but if you're new here, it comes. Uh, Ryan Clam didn't come out to party that night. He stayed up in his room where he was sharing the room with Chris Roper and Roper had gone with a whole bunch of other IGN editors to go see The Dark Knight at a midnight showing. It, you know, it coincided there with that E3, so that tells you whatever year that is. I'm too lazy to look it up right now. And so it was me, Brudvig, Clayman, and Colin and we went up there and I believe I forget.",

And so it was me, Brudvig, Clayman, and Colin and we went up there and I believe I forget. I think we had Clayman knock on the door because Clement trusted and liked Clayman and then we all hid on the sides and then when Clement opened the door, we all ran in there. Now it's worth pointing out of course what I'm driving at here is the four of us, we were drunk. Clemens was stone cold sober. He didn't come out. He's staying in his room and so now he's putting up with all of us being a bunch of idiots in his room hanging out. We're all being loud and obnoxious or whatever. And Colin always tells the story of the moment he thought he killed Dave Clayman when he like basically bent down and grabbed Clayman at the legs and lifted him up and then just let go. And so Clayman just went completely over his back and fell down. He got up, he was fine, no broken neck like we were concerned, but in the middle",

Uh, we called Chris Roper and left a message basically that, uh, things had gotten out of control that night and Clement had broken a window or that, uh, no, we had like Clayman had broken a window and that Clement was in the bathroom spinning in a circle vomiting and we thought it was the funniest thing in the world and then forgot all about it and I kind of passed out in the bed and just laid there and it turned out that Chris Roper did not think this was a joke and so he got out of seeing the movie at midnight and so it's like, you know, 2:30 in the morning or whatever cuz Chris Nolan, he loves the long films and, uh, he gets the message and he comes back just furious, just so fur and he throws the",

It's worth pointing out at this point, Clayman I think was in the bathroom making fake vomiting noises. So we were, that was, that was a fun story.

They don't even think about it and he passes and he's just like, when you're in charge, you write the rules, rules say I go home and just as he says that Craig Harris one",

A simpler moment or a more recent moment of course, Podcast Beyond 300 was a huge deal for me and Nan of course, six years of Podcast Beyond. I've been on it since episode one that meant a lot to me.

The way the crowd reacted to that and the way everybody flipped out was just awesome. That was like one of those experiences like just wow, we're so so lucky to have this. All right, so for a fourth one, I'm going to say the Ghostbuster story with Dan Aykroyd. Now here, here's the here's the whole thing. I'm not going to tell you the Ghostbuster story with Dan Aykroyd. It involves this shirt . It's a really good story, but it's kind of long and it should probably be its own video. I don't, I don't see why I'm wasting all my video ideas in one video, right? So I'll do that soon enough and then I'll come back and I'll, I'll link the shirt, but the first day this goes live, it won't be so somebody remind me, Ghostbuster story, Dan",

And then my fifth favorite moment, now these are off top of my head again, these aren't ranked, they aren't ordered. I've had a million, I've had six and a half years of memories at IGN and I have a million things I, I love and very incredibly thankful for, but when Metal Gear Solid 4 came to us was a crazy time. Jeff Hayes was going to review that for us. I, I am a huge Metal Gear fan and it was one of those days where we kept refreshing the FedEx, you know, or UPS or whatever it was tracking s of like where is this package, where is this package, where is this package and finally it said delivered. We all ran to the mail room and it wasn't there. Now we were , you know, we were in an office park. There was many floors of the building. So we talked to our, you know, mail room guy, he didn't know it was up, he, he",

So we talked to our, you know, mail room guy, he didn't know it was up, he, he didn't come through and like, well, sometimes they delivered to other floors and we started doing like a floor by floor sweep of the building trying to figure out who has this package, come on, get up here, who has this package, where it is. None of these other floors have it. We call Konami like we can't do anything about it. Here's all the information. We call FedEx. Finally they give us the driver's number and like we call the driver and figure out that he delivered it to not even like in our office Park like 15, 20 minutes away in another part of another suburb of San Francisco.

I call it was like air conditioning repair or something and get that guy who's running that place on the phone, but he's leaving soon, but if I can be there in the next 20 minutes, he'll give it. So I get in my car and just like speed over there, blah, blah and get there and it was like it was just one of those crazy like races against the clock and like this story doesn't sound much better being told , but it was fun. It was a good time. We got, I got there in time. Now the interesting thing is this guy knew the package and misdelivered, but he still opened it, which I thought was super weird. Don't do that. If you get somebody else's mail, don't open it and he's like, oh, it games. He didn't of course that it was a huge unreleased game that was a really, really big deal, but whatever.

I said Dave Clayon almost getting his neck broke, us screwing with Chris Roper, Jeremy Dun getting shot in the head, but the other ones Kinda Funny. I have a lot of them. Uh, those were in no particular order. So you know, Colin, Damon, don't be offended that you didn't get mentioned here. I love you guys very, very much and I love you.
