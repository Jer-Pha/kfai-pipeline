Every Wednesday and Friday, I take one of your questions from YouTube comments or Twitter and turn them into these here videos that you hopefully like, subscribe to the channel, and then share with your friends. Today's question comes from Tyroo. He says, you and me, he wants, wants me to talk about. Let me tell you about Tyroo. Okay, first off, you know, Tyroo, formerly of IGN, now of Super Knocking Boots fame. Um, I did not like Tyroo one bit when I first met this guy. All right, cuz I show up at IGN, I'm one of the, one of the fat kids, I'm with the other fat kids or whatever. And then there's this like goddamn Adonis over here with his hair slicked back and his **** chiseled everything and he's doing push-ups and stuff. But like, here's where it's not even just based on visuals that I didn't like for Tyroo. I didn't like Tyroo because me and him were going down, like my first month there, first few weeks going down to Activision to see one of the Spider-Man",

I didn't like Tyroo because me and him were going down, like my first month there, first few weeks going down to Activision to see one of the Spider-Man games. I want to say it would have been Spider-Man 3. And it was me, him, Doug Perry, another former IGN editor. And I got to the airport before Doug did. And I worked with Doug closely and I'd met Ty obviously around the office once or twice. I get to the airport, I sit down in the chair at the terminal directly across from Tyroo. We make eye contact, I give him the nod and he just goes back down to whatever he's doing. And I'm like, **** you man, like what's your problem? And then Doug showed up, sat down and Ty was all like, oh, hey Doug. And Doug's like, hey, did you see Greg? And he's like, oh no, I didn't see him. I'm like, **** liar, Ty. You look right at me in the eyes, gave you the head nod. I know you're a good-looking dude, but you're not just getting random head nods in the SFO Pro. But you know, over the",

I know you're a good-looking dude, but you're not just getting random head nods in the SFO Pro. But you know, over the years, Ty grew on me like a fungus. Of course, fungus probably grows on him after he goes to the gym or whatever. Turns out he's a good guy, dedicated guy, works out too much, drinks too much Muscle Milk, gives terrible advice on Super Knocking Boots podcast, which you can subscribe to and buy at gameovergreg.com, Knockin Boots. But Ty's a great guy. I like him a lot. I love him now. But that first impression, man, go **** yourself, Ty. So that's another Gregway in the books. Remember, if you want me to make more of these, you need to leave questions in the comments below or hit me up on Twitter. Until then, GRE, hit the Gregway with your segue and ride on down to the [Music] Bay.",
