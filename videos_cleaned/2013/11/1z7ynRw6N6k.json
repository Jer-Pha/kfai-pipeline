That's the new thing. Episode numbers are stupid. We're moving away from that. But that's what I'm here to talk to you about, not answering a question. Usually Gregways, they pop up every Wednesday and Friday. You guys ask a question or girls, I answer the question for you. We all have a big enjoyable time. But here's the thing, there's a lot of housekeeping notes about gameovergreggy.com, youtube.com/gameovergreggy. Uh , some stuff's coming up here. We want to make sure breast first the situation to be breasted of. Hey, we hit 50,000 subscribers. Thank you. I want to thank you all. Thank you all so much for supporting us while we make these dumb videos and have fun with you and horse around and talk in the comments for an hour every morning. Big fan of that. So here's what we're going to do to celebrate 50,000 subscribers. We're not publishing a video at all.",

We're not publishing a video at all next week. Not see if you're not in, if you're not in the country, you're not here in America, you're over there in the Brit. Oh, it's me, McDonald. What Thanksgiving? I don't remember that one. Oh, when we let you go, that was foolish of us. Uh, no, thank Thanksgiving's next week. It's a, it's a holiday. We're not going to have any time to make videos. So next week we're taking a week off. I'm just going to promote cool content we've done in the year and a half we've been doing the channel. That's great. That's fun. So you might be asking then, how are you going to come back, Greg? What are you going to do to come back huge in December? And what day would that be? Hold on, I got my little iPad here, product placement. If you want to throw me a few bones, Apple, you know what am I going to do when we return the week of December",

If you want to throw me a few bones, Apple, you know what am I going to do when we return the week of December 2nd? Well, ladies and gentlemen, you know what that sound means. Yes, Oreo Oration will return for limited engagement, five episodes, Monday through Friday, Oreo Oration just for you. There'll be some holiday Oreos tossed in there. There will be regular Oreos tossed in there. This is for you guys. A lot of you have been very vocal about wanting more Oreo Oration. I am happy to bring it back in a limited run and hopefully we finish them off and then we just have to pick up the banana split one here, there , whatever, no big deal. Oreo Oration for you. But then we're going to get back to business the week of December 9th, right? So December 9th, it'll be everything you expect, a conversation with Colin Gregway, Tuesday through Friday.

But here's the big one, ladies and gentlemen, we are debuting a new show every Monday. What's that show called? It's the GameOverGreggy Show. We're going to use mics like this. What is the GameOverGreggy Show? The GameOverGreggy Show looks like this. Start with me, start with him, probably the least prepared of all of us. I bet no, 100% prepared Disney princess list. Wow, you got R, you got right out of the gate with that. Well, everybody, it's been a fun run of the GameOver show. Incorrigible, aren't they? No, what it is is it's four best friends getting together. Each one of them brings a topic to the table and every Monday we discuss each one of those topics. It goes for a long time. It's like an hour and a half. We're giving you this awesome video podcast every Monday. Now we will literally have nerdy conversations every day on gameovergreggyday.com and what's",

Now we will literally have nerdy conversations every day on gameovergreggyday.com and what's really cool about the GameOverGreggy Show, if you ask me and you are because you're still watching, is that you get the free show on YouTube, right? You come here, you watch us all clown around at this table in this very setting with these very mics or if you want, you can go to our Bandcamp page and for 99 cents get a high quality MP3. You can listen to wherever you go cuz guess what? I'm not going to go through an hour and a half and put b-roll over jack, not a thing that's happening. So instead you go there, you get the MP3 , you listen, you come to YouTube, get it for free, you have a good time. Either way, we thank you for your support and how else do we thank you for your support? Let me tell you. All right, I know these holidays are right around the corner.

Oh man, that Grahams, what are you going to get her? Maybe you want to get her some MP3 s of our show, but that's hard to stuff in a stocking unless you get an iPod, but God, who has the money these days with iPods going for upwards of a grand. So you know what you do? You go to the brand new, I I don't have a drum roll effect, GameOverGreggy store. That's right, we finally have a merch store and what are we selling? Well, ladies and gentlemen, two T-shirts. Number one, the GameOverGreggy shirt. You've probably seen it places like on my body. There it is. You can go buy this now, almost not now, in December when we launch the store, you can go buy it there. And what else can you get? Finally, a shirt for the man who should be president in all of our hearts, Colin Moriarty. Look at it, it's blue, got some blue text on it too, huh? Looks like a certain Rockman. I",

So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, lots of awesome stuff coming up to youtube.com/gameovergreggy. So let's recap. Thank you for your support, 50, 000 Subs, that's awesome. Keep telling your friends, keep sharing the videos. We do this, have a conversation with you, a nerdy conversation with you every day. Then Thanksgiving, no new episodes. Week after Thanksgiving, December 2nd, we are back with five new Oreo Orations just for you . Please enjoy them, share them and stop asking me every time you see me at PAX.
