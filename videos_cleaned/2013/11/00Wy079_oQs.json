Every Wednesday and Friday, I take a question from the comments on this here YouTube video and or tweets you sent me at GameOverGreggy and I make a video answering them. It's fun, you like it. So you like the video, then you subscribe to the channel, then you and I hang out at PAX and we go with like air guitars and it's never happened before. Uh, today's question comes from Taylor . Taylor says, who has the best hair at IGN? Taylor, get the out of here. Who is it? Fran Mirabella the third. This is IGN law. There's no, nobody even tries to challenge this. There's not even a question. Like he asking who likes Wings the most? Clearly me. Who is the best hair at IGN? Fran. This has been a long running joke for as long as Fran worked there, which has been something like 30 years. He's an old man. He doesn't look it, but let me tell you what, old dude FR is very particular about his hair. You know, in the in the IGN studio, we shoot up at noon. They also do the Daily Fix.",

They also do the Daily Fix. Naomi, she hosts Daily Fix. She bought a bunch of hair care products in there. You see Fran run in there and I've seen him run in there and spray down his hair with hairspray and then he's got this whole regimen. And then one day we were out drinking and I, he, I forget how we started talking about hair and I was talking about that I condition every day and he flipped the out. He looked at me. He's like, Greg, you only condition Tuesday and Thursday from now on. Like, all right FR, that's kind of advice you take from him. When I give you Wing advice, you take it. Fran Mirabella gives you hair advice, you take it. He's a beautiful man with a beautiful head of hair. Here's a montage of Fran Mirabella's hair. [Music] [Music]",
