Every Wednesday and Friday, I answer a question submitted by you in the comments on these YouTube videos or from the tweets on my Twitter. Today's question comes from Graham. Gamy, grimy, doesn't spell his name normal, not my problem. Grammy here says, in an alternate universe where Greg Miller wants children, what would you call them and would you encourage them to game? Everybody knows I don't want kids. Kids suck. Kids are bad. All the responsibility I want weener dogs. Portillo's easy. You take care of them. I didn't train him well. He's not even trained well, but he's still a good dog, aren't you, buddy? But the world where I have children, where I've just screwed up every decision and ended up with kids, huh? I've always liked the named Abigail. Abby. Abigail, solid name for a kid. Solid name for a human being. She seems like she'd stand up. Come for tell, don't screw with the mic. Abigail's a good one. As far as a boy, never thought about it. Don't want him. Seven like in like",

Don't want him. Seven like in like from Seinfeld, that seems like a good one. Good enough. Would I encourage the children to game? Of course, I would. I would like that's the one thing right now about having uh having friends who've screwed up their lives and had kids. I get to be cool Uncle Greg, right, where I just show up and I just walk in. I'm like toys and I give them all like I make it R action figures on them and stuff like that. Uh when they're old enough, I will guarantee I'll be buying them PlayStations and Xboxes and Vitas and whatever the next handheld is. Like I want to screw these children to become people I'd want to talk to. If these kids only want to talk about soccer or some other like that, like get the out of here. So you got to start young. Like same thing with like Missouri, right? Like these kids like I buy like when they're babies",

Like these kids like I buy like when they're babies, I buy them Missouri onesies and granted they live in Illinois , but that's close enough. I'm trying to you know get that get it going get get the roots in nice and young so that they go somewhere I care about so that I have a reason to talk to them when they are 18. Otherwise get out of here. Oh, how's your baseball team doing? Great. How fast did you run the the 470 today? That sounds good. You got a good old cross country future. He I guess no, you got to you got to warp children people warp him the wrong way into bad things, you know, and put out cigarettes and stuff on them or whatever. Don't do that, but give them comic books, give them video games, make them become the people you want. Now granted, this might drive them away from it, right? You give them all the stuff for things you'd want them to be into.",

Get these kids to become the people you want. Otherwise you have no reason to talk to them and you're stuck with him for 18 years. So that's another Gregway in the books. Remember, leave your question for me in the comments below or tweet them at me and then come back every Wednesday and Friday to see what crazy I'm going to say on Gregway.",
