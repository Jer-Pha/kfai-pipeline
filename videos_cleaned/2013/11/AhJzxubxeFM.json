What's up everybody? Welcome to A Conversation With Colin. I'm Greg and this is my roommate, Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff , so every Tuesday and Thursday I reach into the random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at him, and we talk it out for your amusement. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to us on YouTube, and share this video with your friends. Colin, you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is the dos and don'ts of bar etiquette from The Bar Podcast. Wonder why they care. I'll tell you the first one: when you go to the bar, make eye contact with the bartender at some point and smile. Don't sit there and be a dick with your money out. Don't be all yelling. Don't be on your phone. These are why they you get ignored. When you go to the bar, go to the bar, smile, you understand that they're working hard, he or she",

Yeah, I I I um bars I I there are certain bars I really like going to because it's easy to get a drink and there are certain bars I refuse to go to because they're run by hipster douchebags, which is the one you refuse to go to? Like, oh, I love Zest. Most hipsterish, a lot of hipsters go there, but the the bartenders are also hipsters and they think they're like so cool and they they don't I walk up I walk up there in an Old Navy sweatshirt and I get served no problem and I have a good little jovial conversation with them and I look like this. I don't like I've not had good experiences though . Well, that's your own fault. You come in with a preconceived attitude. You no I don't. No, I don't. I I like you just called them the most hipster thing so you",

I I like you just called them the most hipster thing so you probably walk up and you're all like calling about stats and stuff. That's that's me. That's a that's that's informed by experience, Greg. That's informed by exp had good experiences there. We should go back and try it one day. Okay. Uh yeah, I I think yeah, I agree. Like I I like to do like the whole like, you know, lean on the bar kind of look, you know, look at the drinks and you know, like I don't want to like I don't want to pressure them, but sometimes I'll take you know, like I put my wallet on the on the you know, being like I'm ready to buy. I'm not sitting here trying my wallet occasion. I'll hold my wallet. Uh I'm not being like, you know, hold yeah, but like, you know, I also it it's also different depending on the you get from the bar on the bartenders.

I think that uh you know, uh there are places you go that are not Equitable to like getting a drink based on when you approach the bar or something and then there are bars that I really like that I think are easy to you know, so I don't I don't I don't quite know that you know what the etiquette would be. I mean I in terms of tipping um I think the you know I like to give a dollar per drink. Yeah, that's what I do too. Good think that if I get the change I'll leave the change too, you know, I don't want to eat coins. Yeah, there's one bar called Fireside in the Sunset that their drinks all cost like an a strange amount of money like $4.50 for a beer or something like that and then they give you quarters and I'm like I I",

I like having them for a launch and stuff, but I just like I'm like what do you want me to **** do with this, you know, and then that forces you to give them a $1.50. See, I think that's why they do it. Partilla, don't eat that beef stick. I think that's why they do it. When I was in Austin, Texas, I did that. I went to a bar of the same kind where I was like, okay, it's 450 and then I get and I leave them the 50 cents and the dollar and I'm like, wait a second, I'm wise to this game. Yeah, I think I think that's a little that's a little messed up, but the the my favorite bar in there's a few bars I like in San Francisco if if you want to go Underdogs is really one of our standbys. That's that's 19th in Irving. That's a really good bar, but in terms of more traditional bars, Yan's in in the Inner",

That's a really good bar, but in terms of more traditional bars, Yan's in in the Inner Sunset I really like and the reason I like Yan's is there's a few reasons, right? Got an old feel to it. It's like it's carpeted, it's all dirty there there tables and people hanging out people in the back playing Yahtzee like playing darts like doing all sorts of stuff, but you can also bring outside food in there. That is a nice move. Yes, and like you can bring in whatever you want so you can bring in like a whole pizza and eat it at a table or like bring in your bur ritos or I really like that part of that bar. Yan's gets too crowded on like Saturday nights for me. That's the problem. It's too loud. It's super hot in there. I'm not a fan of that and then they are playing games in the back you can't hear . I I'm already hard of hearing. That's why I like Fireside a lot. Fireside's a good bar to go chat at.",

Fireside's a good bar to go chat at. Even Underdogs gets crazy, but I I like 21st Amendment downtown. Yeah, 21st is good. They got great burgers. They won't let you sit unless you're going to eat which kind of sucks and uh just one one last bar that I that I quite enjoy was one of my first favorite bars in San Francisco is uh Hopson's Choice. Hopson's Choice is nice uh at Hate and God what is it? Hate and not Ashberry, the one before that Clayton. Hate and Clayton. All right, there you go. All right, I like Mad Dog in the Fog there too. Hate got a bunch of good bars. All right, there you go. The Bar Podcast, now you a little bit about San Francisco bars and what to not do there. Basically, don't be a dick.
