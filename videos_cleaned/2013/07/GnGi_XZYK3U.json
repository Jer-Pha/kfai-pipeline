    "description": "Got a hankering for some chicken wings? Let wing expert Greg Miller walk you through baking them at home.\n\nToday's topic was submitted by Colin Moriarty. Leave your suggestions for future conversations in the comments below.\n\nRECIPE\n- Chicken wings (1 or 2 pounds)\n- Teaspoon of salt\n- Tablespoon of veggie oil\n- Cup of flour or pancake power\n- Pepper and cayenne pepper and garlic salt and whatever\n\n1) Put the wings in a bowl. Coat'em with the veggie oil. Toss on the salt. Rub everything together.\n\n2) In a big ol' Ziploc, mix the flour/pancake powder with the other spices you like. \n\n3) Toss the wings in the powder mixture you've made.\n\n4) Lay the coated wings out on greased baking sheets.\n\n5) Slide the sheets into a pre-heated 435-degree oven. Leave'em for 20 minutes.\n\n6) At the 20-minute mark, flip'em and increase the heat to 445 degrees. Let'em cook for another 20 minutes.\n\n7) Warm up your sauce if it's cold.\n\n8) After the second 20-minute session, toss in your sauce and eat them.\n\nSUBSCRIBE/LIKE/SHARE\n\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday, roommates Greg and Colin sit down, and Greg throws a random conversation topic at Colin. In return, Colin usually says something crazy and you get a chuckle. Subscribe so you don't miss the madness.\n\nFollow us on Twitter\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/gameovergreggy\nColin - http://www.twitter.com/notaxation\n\n#AConversationWithColin Playlist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL85130F65C312F61E&feature=plcp\n\nHuge thanks to Nick and Tim for filming.",
