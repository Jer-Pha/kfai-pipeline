I'm Greg and this is my roommate, Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff, so every Tuesday and Thursday I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at him, and we talk it out for your amusement. If you like that, like the video, share it with your friends, subscribe to our YouTube channel. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic comes from AlexInChains822: who would win in a fight between you and Greg? Oh my. I drop Greg like a bag of **** dirt. See, like that's why I got to be kidding. That's why I think I have the best chance is cuz you don't see it coming. Now if it's just straight fist to cuffs and I don't even, we're arguing the couch and we get up and you're swinging, then I'm in trouble. But I'm going to come in, get you, I'm going to get you low, get you on the ground. I mean that's so that's like an alligator. It's the",

I mean that's so that's like an alligator. It's the ground game that I want and then I'll be twisting around. I mean it it so that's the thing is that I'm first of all, I'm a lot stronger than I look and I think I think certain people people know this about me. Sure. I recruited Craig Baron, I helped him move. I was lifting very heavy things. I I have a little girl arms so people don't think that I'm strong, but I and I think it comes from, you know, I played hockey. It's a very violent sport. I play my true and I was also like a really crazy player and I was a goalie too. So like it's very unusual. I I love throwing punches and getting in the shoving matches and fights and all those things, especially when I got into high school and I had not I just didn't give a **** anymore, right? Um and uh if you got your hands on me that's a different story because",

Um and uh if you got your hands on me that's a different story because you're you are literally stronger than me. So and you're you're big. I'd be **** actually if you if you got your hands on me. But if I I'm like we're UFC fighters, right? You're more of the boxer brawler, I'm more of the wrestler. Yeah. Like I I think that if I got a few like swings on you, you wouldn't you would hit the ground. Sure. I be dazed real bad. Yeah. See and this is like whenever whenever want people want to argue about like Batman versus whoever, there's always these caveats, right ? Like sure if Superman fell from the sky and it was just like real life then Batman's dead. But I think at least give me I have a chance in this one. Oh yeah, you have a if you get your hands on you have a 100% chance of winning the fight. Oh wow , okay. I like those eyes. Like maybe not 100, maybe there's like some way that",

Like maybe not 100, maybe there's like some way that I like get out of. Sure, sure, sure. But like you have a strength that would be violent if you got your hands on me because you're much bigger than I you'd be able to choke me or you know, put me into use all this weight I got throw it be. But if we were to start on like, you know, you would have to rush me. I mean see this see this is the thing that's that's that's going to be tough for you is that the running. Yeah. No, yeah, the running the running. But you would to to win the fight you are going to have to come at me and that means that I'm going to have to take a few swings at you. Now whether or not you can kind of like, you know, not be phased by them , you know, do some blocking like sure, sure, sure. Yeah, that's see if I'm blocking like that then yeah, I'm ****.

And then you're and then it's going to be over for you. You know, if I don't if I grab you and try if if at any yeah, I totally get you. I see if we're running what I'm gonna have to do is yeah, I've got to somehow get you off guard, throws something at you and try to get you low in the in the Torso region and get you down and hide my head around from the back of you, right? But yeah, I understand what you're saying if if again if you get if I'm running and you connect once in the head like yeah now now there's another there's there's an X Factor a wild card here, Portilla. Portillo is the wild card. It's that why don't if you threw a punch, you know, then see like now now this",

It's that why don't if you threw a punch, you know, then see like now now this changes the dynamic of the fight again because you know you have you have a lot of strength here, you know, like see like your punch would actually do more damage than my punch would I think in literal terms like I think that see and but my thing is like for me like this like you know up up like this like standing is so foreign like you know what I mean ? Like that that's like maybe I could maybe but I like you're talking about like in hockey you were already fighting you were already doing that kind of stuff whereas I grew up wrestling. That's why I want to get you on the ground and even then I'm going to get you on the ground and then it's like you know elbow strikes and stuff because we're going to be so tight because I was teaching you about some of the dirty things that goalies do, right?",

Specifically goalies do very dirty things and if you if you like so it wasn't like you know especially in in when you're youth hockey or high school they're not going to let you like drop your gloves and fight. It's about getting those punches in before anything like before anyone sees it. Of course you have a blocker when you're a goalie or whatever which is a hard you know hard piece of plastic or whatever that you you know stop pucks with punch someone in the back of the head with that and and they're going to be pretty dazed punch them in the back and they're going to be pretty dazed take your stick and hit them in the back of the Cal and they're going to be pretty hurt put your stick underneath their blade and just T touch a bit so they fall backwards the little dirty things like that",

So um just being around you're going to fight dirty yeah probably yeah me too I would be fighting dirty real bad crotch I'd be going for the eyes too remember you know George Castanza, Jason Alexander himself once on The Tonight Show was talking about how he was taking some self-defense course and what he told Jay Leno was that yeah like eyes are like grapes and so you can jam your eyes in go to the side their eyes would pop and they I'm like that's that is what I will do in every fight from now on and I haven't had to use it yet but I'm ready and if it had to be you well godamn it it has to be you well I think I think the bigger they are the harder they fall Greg so all right that was a good topic no I mean no clear answer",
