            "text": "[ Music] Tim , yes what's your topic? So last week the internet went damn crazy over this video called Too Many Cooks and it was the best thing in the world. Yeah, so for those that don't know, we're annotating to it right down here. Go Adult Swim at 4:00 a.m. over the last month apparently has been running this uh 15minute block called Infomercial. Um that's just the best thing in the world. Yeah, now Nick, what is it? Explain it. It's it's it's impossible to explain. It is basically just a giant troll. Like I don't know where this came from, what drug they were doing that made them do this, but I hope I never it's us with unlimited money. So from what I hear is that's what happened. It's the yeah, it was designed to **** with people that were high at 4:00 a.m. Yeah, and what it is cuz we haven't exactly explained yet is the old 70s and 80s like sitcom theme songs int it has intro where it's like it'll like you'll see someone they're just like doing the thing and then look at camera smile and says their",

Yeah, yeah, but it like and that's selling is short CU it goes from in sitcom to sitcom to like crime drama to cartoon to space and the whole time there's a unifying thread that there's a murderer in the background of all these things and then at the end he starts killing everybody and they all try to stop them. Yeah, the weird thing is it's not even the end that he starts killing him. He starts killing him like maybe Midway through four or five minutes into it he starts creeping out as I was watching it and me and Colin were talking a little about this earlier. I people are in two camps with this either they think the end's better or the beginning is better. Like people think it either gets better as it goes on or that the beginning was the",

Like people think it either gets better as it goes on or that the beginning was the funniest. I think the beginning was funniest. I thought it kind of lost its track and just went **** crazy and there was no sense to it. Like unless I'm just not getting it, unless this is some form of high art that I just can't wrap my head around it's it's the Adult Swim guys. It's the Williams Street guys. It is it is not high art. It is high art there. It's awesome. Like I'm with when I first saw it I was with you and I was like oh this is great. It's going to keep doing it's going to keep expanding on into this like endless loop of 80s intros, right? Because like it when it starts up the second one and then merges the families and everything gets crazy like oh that's really funny. I wonder what but then when it gets crazy I remember in the middle of my first VI I was like how long holy **** this",

I think it's just a great Riff on TV intros you know what I mean and just like CU they do like the Law and Order stuff and there and all these other different things that they pull it back together and make fun of and I mean it makes no sense sure but the the fact like Colin kept saying when I showed it to him the first time why didn't we think of this we should have know like whoa like maybe we would have thought to do like make fun of 80s inro we would have thought to put a killer in it and hide him in back frame cuz now then now it's one of those things you watch it again and you catch some different every time but it's just crazy like the",

No I was gonna say here's how how I think this went down and someone please if you were a part of this project correct me if I'm wrong someone was like hey it's almost the end of the year and we've got an extra $50,000 but we need to film something in a week go and that's just it and we have we have stuff like that happened to us all the time where we're like where someone's like not that kind of not that much money is like hey I have $50,000 you guys want to do a rap video no it's like someone's like hey we got to get this video out the door really quick just whatever the first thing is that comes to your brain go do it you know but so pretty much the exact same thing but",

I was talking to Tim before that I would have I would have kept it going as it was in the first three or four minutes for as long as possible. I think that that was really funny like when it went from to like the Roseanne style and yeah like if they I just thought it would been been funny if they just kept putting more and more and more characters into it until there was like literally 200 characters in the in the show like that to me would have been funny enough like the whole sl asher thing like I would not have come up with it's funny and it's silly.
