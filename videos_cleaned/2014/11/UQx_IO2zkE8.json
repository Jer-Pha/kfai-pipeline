I think Tupac was the most influential artist to come out of that period cuz he died and that's my problem with Tupac. The problem with Tupac is is I feel like a lot of people are fake fans of Tupac. They say they like him, but they don't was I wasn't a fan at all. It's one of those things.

For instance, like presumably, like aren't there certain animals like dolphins or whales, whatever, that have like partners, some birds and some that have like partners for life. That's like kind of where it comes from. Like they do love that other thing, that other bird, that other Pelican, whatever the hell it is.
