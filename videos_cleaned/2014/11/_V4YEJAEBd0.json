      "text": "[ Music] Greetings and salutations, this is Follow the Liter, a Kinda Funny production that's all about craft cocktails, whether you want to order them at a bar or make them at home. My name is Colin Moriarty and this is my good friend, master bartender Erick Castro. Thanks for having me. So people know if they watch the GameOverGreggy show or watch the Kinda Funny videos, we have an official liquor, it's called Bourbon and there's a specific drink that's made with Bourbon that I love very much. I think you're talking about an Old Fashioned, Colin. Yes, I am. Old Fashioned, he's like the Godfather classic cocktails, people were drinking 200 years ago, with any luck they'll be drinking 200 years from now. Yes, my friend. So we're making it with Bourbon, but you can also make it with Rye, correct? You can make it with Rye, Rum, Cognac, pretty much taking you have around the house. Today we're going to be using a good old-fashioned Bourbon. Excellent. We're going to start this drink out with a couple - two",

We're going to start this drink out with a couple - two Angostura Bitters, which bitters are kind of like the salt and pepper cocktail, so just a little bit goes a long way. I'm going to do a quarter ounce of simple syrup and it would be a Bourbon Old Fashioned that a couple ounces of good old Kentucky Bourbon. Now, Erick, I see this thing, a lot of people tweet pictures at us because they know it's like our official drink on the on Kinda Funny and they're putting muddled fruit in it and they're messing it up. What's with that? Why are people doing that? Unfortunately, that's something that kind of started up in the early 1900s and it's been pretty hard to get rid of ever since. Simple is what the old bat control about so we're putting a little bit of icy air in the in the to mix it around with that one actor another nice no we're actually not going to",

Simple is what the old bat control about so we're putting a little bit of icy air in the in the to mix it around with that one actor another nice no we're actually not going to use this ice. What we're going to do is we're just going to stir the drink up to get it nice and cool and remember also when I'm stirring it, not only is it getting cold, it's actually picking up a little bit of water as well. So it's not really a cocktail it'll picks up that water to kind of smooth everything out. All right, so we're stirred and now we're pouring. Yeah, now we're going to strain it over this really big rock right here. The reason why we have a big piece of ice is because it keeps the drink nice and cold. It also dilutes very little so you don't have to worry about having to water down talked to a lot of time you've done. I know there's one last component that's actually contingent on whether you Bourbon or Rye. This is one of the things you taught me. Yeah, yeah, we always recommend at our bar",

      "text": "a lot of time you've done. I know there's one last component that's actually contingent on whether you Bourbon or Rye. This is one of the things you taught me. Yeah , yeah, we always recommend at our bar is that if you're having it with Bourbon, put a nice big lemon twist on top that's kind of give it a little bit of structure, but you're make with Rye, I recommend using orange twisters it kind of complements the spice, express the zest. I don't know how you do that. I want to get all the oils on top then just go ahead and drop your twist in there color side out perfect. So that my friends it's a Bourbon Old Fashioned, enjoy. Give it a try, Colin, let me know what you think. All right, well , Erick, I show does make a vessel fashion's he's actually ruined me for most of the other old catches I've ever had so let's give it a go. It's perfect. It's absolutely perfect.
