I've got this is I've been I've waiting for this topic for a while since this person sent it to me on Twitter. Nick Scarpino, if you have topics for the show, send them, send them my way and maybe you'll get your topic on the show like bore aage games says, simply put, pie versus cake. Pie. I feel like this is the right before we before we go, this is the right season to be talking about this cuz we're headed straight into pumpkin pie season and pumpkin pie, man, I could just all day breakfast , lunch, and dinner, pumpkin pie, 100%. Whipped cream. Why didn't you just say eat? Why'd you make it weird? Cuz in in your headphones it sounds so much dirtier when he's like it's like it's like it's like oh cool. I don't have headphones. Okay, tonight tonight's been my jokes. See, he used to do that to me all the time on the podcast. Cleanse your ears. You want some Q-tips? No, I'm good. I'm just going to go burn them. Fire. Oh.",

Obviously it's wings and it's pizzas and it's salty and it's terrible food like that. Sweets have to be in a mood for and I find myself I can be in moods for either. I enjoy cake. I but when I say cake, I want I I enjoy the horrible sheet cake every so often you get from like Jeco, Safeway out here, a grocery store sheep cake, whatever. Of course, then there's the opposite, Susie Cakes, amazing cakes here in San Francisco. They're just so **** good. But those are even too sweet sometimes. Pie, I feel like if I'm ever cake could come around and I like no, I don't like looking at frosting. I don't like this. Pie comes around, I'm usually down with it. You got the",

What pie don't you like? Minced meat, pecan. That's stupid. That's a great pie. Pecan pie is amazing. Mm- arguably top five pies. More than five pies. There's plenty of pie. What you talking about? More than I like key lime . Key lime's amazing, but it's it can be intense. Pumpkin is just a league of its own. Lemon meringue, lemon meringue also dynamite, dynamite **** pie. Yeah, not a huge what? Apple special it is real got apple pie. You can put a little little little vanilla ice cream on the side of that bad boy alode. They call alode. Yeah, come on son.

Cake's really, really, really good. If I said to you right now, cake or pie, I think I would go cake really. It takes the cake. Ah, um the biggest problem with the cake is the frosting because your cake can be good, but the frosting can just not be right. So be there's a fine line between too much, too little, too sweet, too sour. Yeah, and just mess it up. Red velvet cake. Oh, I I've had enough of it. What? It's time for it to go away. No, it's too I I don't it's that's another one you lay on that **** sour cream cream cheese frosting. See, I'm not a huge fan of the cake, but the cupcake, that's another story.

It's really good and then if you're like me, you power through like a man and then you get to the next day and you're just shaking the whole time. Not a big deal. We can deal with it. But uh yeah, no, I don't know. I look forward to every year Thanksgiving. Yeah, my mother makes pumpkin pie. She makes about like four of them and between my brother and I and I love him, we fight over them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Yeah, it goes before and after everything we eat. Sometimes it is just the meal exactly. Like I'll wake up for breakfast and eat a slice of pumpkin pie and then we'll go see a movie or something the next day after Thanksgiving. It's amazing. Mhm.

Now the thing about them, they're amazing pies. We discovered they they have this crazy story. They had been open when I was in school, but I obviously didn't know cuz I wasn't going on many bakeries when I was in college. Then they closed. Now they're back better than ever. They ship now nationwide. They do the whole thing where they make the pie in a jar, then they cook it in a little jar and then they ship it to you and so then you open you have these little pies and these little jars. Yeah, I'm I'll bring this in the taste test next week. This sounds yeah amazing. They're amazing pies, really good.

It was nice to find a little local EST this is what I'm talking about is that what we did is we were going to barbecue that night so we wanted to bring dessert so we got a bunch of different mini pies, not like tiny pies, you know, like pies where you know you could split comfortably and have a bunch of different stuff and every one of those pies was phenomenal and it was like blueberry, strawberry, rhubarb, pumpkin, cherry. That sound right? There's something else in there. There's another pie in there. It was good. But that's what I'm saying, pies seem to go all over the place. Cake, I couldn't buy like three, four different little small cakes and they wouldn't all be as popular as these pies were. I think pie is the superior to dessert. No, I I totally disagree with that.

They're not going to get destroyed though is what I'm saying and I don't agree with what you're saying about the cupcake being the right ratio. I think the cupcake is even worse than the cake in terms of frosting. The reason why the cupcake is great is because you can you can eat the cupcake and then if you want if you got a red velvet cupcake and a l a lemon cupcake in front of you, you don't have to choose. You can eat them both and you don't have to feel guilty about it. Giant. Well, I mean you just forget about it like everything else. Well, I'm just talking about the ratio of frosting to cake.

She's a real person on Twitter. Follower Kevin put Claire's Twitter down there, but she on the show just did this thing that has now swept the country by storm where you break the bottom off of the cupcake, flip it on top and make a cupcake sandwich. Then you're getting equal amounts of cake and frosting in the bites with that cuz when you get the real cupcake right, it's like all like eating like a weird o and then you inevitably end up with a stump stump cake. Nobody wants no stump cake. I don't want stump cake. We talking about this before the show a little bit, but muffins, I think muffins are really good. Muffins are OG. Sure.
