Like a Rowan Stone, Aowen, who is a second time contributor, if I'm not mistaken, says, has the internet done more harm than good to humanity or is it vice versa? I sign the internet has not done more harm than good. The the internet is for the greater good. There's a lot of bad parts of the internet, right? It uh depresses me on a day-to-day basis. It does a horrible bunch of different things, but no, you cannot sit here and tell me that we're worse off for having the internet. You take a lot of guff from people on the internet sometimes, though. Sometimes you'll say something like the other day when you said hobo and someone thought, see, this is the problem with the internet is that when two people say something and tweet about it, then it seems like a lot of people are saying, but really it's just two people who misheard me, if you didn't know.",

Are you from the the story? Yeah. Oh, I guess the email got forwarded out to the company today. Hilarious. So yeah, in a Destiny video with Alfredo, if I'm correct conversation, I said blah blah blah, well, yeah, you you don't want to do that. You look like a hobo. And I guess I said it so fast that a few people thought I said homo. You distinctively said hobo. It's 100% clear that I did. But one person tweeted me and was like, did you just say if you did this, you'd look like a homo? Is that what you and I'm like, and I all I did was went to our YouTube, Kinda Funny, and I grabbed the video. I was like, when are people going to stop saying no homo? And I was like, no, I would never say that. And I threw it out and they're like, I'm so sorry. I marred y y. And then yeah, there was an email wrote written to IG that",

And then there was an immediate response, under further review, it's clear he didn't say that. I'm sorry. Yeah, and it was just like, but again, that's two two people made it seem like it was a big deal. And that's the big thing about the internet is like things happen and somebody will get offended about it and it's so hard to tell because like I always talk about the vocal minority, right? Somebody's offended, they're motivated to tell you. Hundreds of people see a video and think you did a great job and bail without ever saying, hey, yeah, they're on to the next one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so that's the whole thing. Like that honestly, like the day-to-day you suck die, like that comes through, which is super minimal nowadays, never gets me down . It's super",

Yeah, I mean, I feel like I I feel the same way, right? Like no matter what the internet, what no matter what bad comes from the internet, it will forever do more good than harm. I think I mean this this the proliferation spread of information can never be a bad thing in my opinion unless it's misinformation, which there's a lot of. Well, there is a lot of, but but anyone that's I that's the thing, anyone that really wants to get the root of something or the truth of something on the internet can't we'll find it. Yeah , exactly. Like Tim is amazing at finding whatever he needs to find on the internet.

And the the response one of the person put up that I thought was poignant was like going back and finding Benjamin finding like I use there's this device in my hand that has all the knowledge of the world, the knowledge of every civilization on it and I use it to argue with other people. You know what I mean? Like all that information is still there. You know what I mean? All that stuff is still there. Wikipedia is still there. You can have the most off-hand topic of who played Salem the cat and was it Lex Luther and what character Nick P is his name? He was in Seinfeld. He was a l boyfriend in The Smelly Car.

Now real quick, was that that was Lex Luther and Superboy? Uh, I didn't get that far. Okay, that's a less relevant. Don't worry about it. It doesn't matter. Just keep going with your but that's what I'm saying, right? Like that's what I always talk about is the fact that I Tim, you're too young. Nick, you remember, Colin, you remember, you'd be out with your friends and you'd have an argument of was Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars and like no, he wasn't.

I think uh I have no tolerance for stupid people at all, especially today because like you can find all the knowledge and learn something by just going on the internet and **** reading. I know how.com we can go to Lynda.com lcom. I just know how **** hard that is for some people to just go and read. I know that's that's really difficult for some people to do and I I zero tolerance for that. Um so in that respect it is it is really fantastic, but the you know the anonymous nature of the internet has bred uh you know a destructive very small minority of people that ruin it for everyone else and ruin comment sections and ruin Twitter for a lot of people and ruin you know like just a lot of things and that that's less desirable.

Oh, real name request, but that's only to your F friends. Oh, okay, that's too bad. I mean that that kind of stuff like you guys asked me were talking about Reddit the other day and you were like, what's your name? And I'm like, my name on Reddit is Nick Scarpino. It's because I want to be held accountable if I say something stupid or wrong or something that's incendiary or something that's clearly just trolling other people because I feel like that's the responsible thing for people in our place to do, right?

You should always live up what doing cuz you shouldn't put something out there that you it's not even about being proud of cuz I'm not necessarily proud of everything I put out there, but just pictures of you just in a sock, but you should be proud of those because you look amazing. But see that's the thing with all the with with that I would never put a picture out there of myself to in any way that I wasn't okay having everybody see because there's a chance that's going to happen.

There's just a lot of there's a lot of cowardice on the internet in terms of the way people like when people attack us that's cool and that's their prerogative I guess, but more often than not it's with Anonymous you know tags and usernames or whatever. Like I my you know my real name, my face, you know generally where I live and what I do and stuff like that. Like that that takes actual courage. So that kind of aspect of the internet is really discouraging um in my opinion, but I mean I didn't feel like we're getting hung up on such a minority of it. I agree. I think most of a lot of people on online are great to us. They're they're a lot of awesome people. That's not even my big problem. My big problem",

My big problem is just that people you know there are just so many people out there that run around just not knowing the answers to things and it's not like it's not you know I don't mind when people don't know something. I mind when people don't utilize the tools that are before them to learn what they need to know and 20 years ago you had to go to the **** library and look at an encyclopedia or like talk to someone that knew what they we talking about today you could literally find the answer to anything. Yeah, you um and I get so frustrated when people like well I you know I don't know uh you know this out the other thing it's like dude just go it's cool if you don't know but go look it up like there's no reason not to know anymore.

It's like it's important to know where to go for the most correct information on what you're looking at at that time and like getting off of just the people on the internet like like people being mean or being nice it's just like what the internet offers you just in the sense of like you can watch movies get music like anything you want is from the internet and that's crazy. I love that. It's dangerous though, right? You talk about information call and you talk about how you know you can look it up but how do you know how do we all know that we're getting the right answer to you got respectable sources, right?
