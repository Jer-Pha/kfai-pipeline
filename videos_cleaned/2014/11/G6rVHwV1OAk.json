      "text": "what's up everybody welcome to Follow the Liter, a Kinda Funny production where we show you craft cocktails you should be ordering at the bar or making at home. I'm Greg Miller and this is master bartender Erick Castro. What's up everybody? Ballpark, how many people have you gotten drunk with those hands? Talking like large city in China type numbers. Jeez Louise, that's a lot of people. I'm getting ready to go home for the holidays. I want something that combines my love of Oreos with the holidays that I can serve to my mother and watch her pass out. So I go out my friends, what do I do? Oh brother, I got something just for you. We got a cocktail called the Irish Polar Bear and it's a boozy milkshake that's perfect to get you in the holiday spirit. Okay, first we're gonna do, we're gonna start this drink off with a little bit of Irish whiskey. It goes down smooth. Yeah, that's some tasty coffee in the core. Oh, coffee. So let's go ahead and start building this guy. Okay, cool. Go ahead, how much you put in",

Go ahead, how much you put in there? Uh, three quarter ounce of uh coffee liqueur. Gotcha. Of course, the coffee keeps you awake, the Jameson puts you to sleep. It's the perfect mix of cocktails. Three quarter ounce Irish whiskey. Here comes the star of the show everybody. What are we using? Mint Oreos, right on in there. And it wouldn't be a boozy milkshake unless you have a little bit of ice cream in there . Oh, a little ice, what flavor are we going with? We're going to be doing a vanilla ice cream. Oh, Dreyer's vanilla, of course. If you're east of the Mississippi, Edy's, weird, right? Why do they do, they just take a big scoop vanilla ice cream in there, just one big scoop and maybe a little more, that's what I like. Here we can give it a little bit of, give it a splash of milk or if you want to be a fat ass, you can hit with some cream.",

Oh yeah, to help accentuate the mintiness out of that, we're gonna pop a nice little mint sprig. What did you, what you beat the hell out of it for a second though? What was that all about? Oh, you gotta release all the aromatics by just uh give it a little bit of slap, give it a quick slap, get ready to have your mind blown. Take a sip. I'm, I have a pretty high bar for Oreo stuff so we'll see if it blows my mind. I love the aromatics and Guri, god damn, I don't, yeah, I see like the joke is of course I don't like sweet stuff all that much, like when I'm drinking rarely do I want a sweet. This of course has the Oreo taste to it, but it's a hint of Oreo and taste a lot of the ice is coming through, it's a cold drink, I like that. Um, it's not overpowering. I could, I",

God damn, that's good. What's it called? It's called the Irish Polar Bear. Well ladies and gentlemen, that's the Irish Polar Bear. What do you think of it? Let us know in the comments. Then make sure you keep coming back here for future episodes of Follow the Liter with Erick Castro where he'll show you how to make all sorts of cool drinks and if you want me to come up with a custom made cocktail specifically for you, go to patreon.com/kindafunny. He's gonna name a cocktail after you, that's insane. Until next time, I'm gonna keep drinking this and probably end up taking off my shirt. Happy holidays, cheers you.",
