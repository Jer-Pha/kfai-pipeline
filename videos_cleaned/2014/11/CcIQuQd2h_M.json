I go after you, Nick you go next. Thank you. Well, my question and my topics uh always come from Twitter. Remember if you want a topic on the GameOverGreggy Show, please tweet at me, Nick Scarpino, and sometimes I will read your topic like at Madame M A T A M U R, did I say that? What is it? M A T A M U R? M M M asks this question, why do Americans hate Florida? As a Canadian, I've always wondered, do we hate Florida? I love this topic. I don't, I don't personally hate Florida. Some people disparage it, some people disparage the South a lot, but is that a thing though? America's hitting Florida? No, but we we we maybe like laugh at it because it just seems like a lot of crazy **** goes down in Florida. It's like the way a lot of crazy **** goes down in Russia, like you just see all these crazy videos. Yeah, I don't know. It's it's just kind of like that same sort of thing just",

It's it's just kind of like that same sort of thing just crazy Florida videos like yeah. Well, I mean, I mean there's there's a 25 season Florida video called Cops and uh one video. I mean think about like Cops takes place everywhere, but yeah, rarely in the north and usually it seems like it's in Florida. And uh I always think so Cops is Cops specifically is fing me. I always talk about this cuz I think I spoke to someone about in Europe about it once or that was European here in the States that like for a lot of people overseas that maybe aren't super familiar with the United States they they they you know, they consume our movies and our music and TV, but like in terms of like real so-called reality TV, they see Cops and they think that that's what it's like. That is kind of what it's like there, but there are people it's just like the **** like Cops is",

Yeah, it's like when you think about it in the context of overseas viewers, it's really f we know it's like oh that's just a Backwater place or some some you know, just a few people that they're making this whole place look bad. But overseas where maybe they don't have the context, it's like no one these **** are crazy. Yeah, yeah, but think about the our main exports as far as TV goes to other places like we we have to export the things that translate best. That's why action movies do really well in countries that don't speak English because they're most predominantly action right explosions.
