Now I'm Tim Gettys, I can't impress anybody so I'm here with Eric Castro, master bartender to teach you a thing or two. Happy to be here, man. Thank you very much. So here's the deal, Eric, I'm the pure one. Everyone at home knows that I like my Mexican Coke. What type of drink can I order that tastes like soda cuz I'm not a big alcohol guy? This cocktail is called The Naughty Dog. The Naughty Dog, wow. So first start with the glass, uhhuh, you add 1 oz of Kahlua and a half of some tasty [Music] rum, fill this tasty mixture up with some ice. I'm just going to top it off with some root beer, arguably the world's greatest beer. Super easy so far, what do you think, man? Too easy. I'm super into this.

Right here we have the Naughty Dog. There you go, man. Let me know what you think. Okay, let's do it. That tastes like a root beer float. Now I'm a huge fan of root beer floats. They might be better than soda cuz they are soda and ice cream, two things I love together in one nice little nut maky piece of goodness. Go and give it a stir. Stir It Up, kind of let all those textures get together and it goes down like a root beer float. Woo, let's do this. It's too easy. Well thanks so much, Eric. Thanks for having me.
