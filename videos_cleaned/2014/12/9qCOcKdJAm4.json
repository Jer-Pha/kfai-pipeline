So if you guys want to watch this, it looks pretty cool actually. They claim it's stop motion, so you can click here. Kevin, do. Kevin's putting it there . Kevin knows to put it there underneath the table. Yeah, it looks pretty interesting. It looks pretty dope. It's it looks more based towards kids, yeah, but it's one of those things where like it's still fun-looking, yeah. Um, but in honor of that, I want this topic to be about robots. Robots. Who are our favorite robots and what robots do we not like? I feel like I'm going to settle in here because I feel like this is going to be a good topic. First and foremost, let's talk about Johnny 5. Yeah, that's what I was going to start with. Start Short Circuit. What a flick , followed by the even better Short Circuit 2.

And especially being a kid when Short Circuit and Short Circuit 2, because I like Short Circuit 2 as a kid because there's none of this of having, you know, Johnny 5's like having an existential crisis, right? No, he's just, he's not trying to kill anybody. He's just hanging out in New York. He was a weapon. No, that's what I'm saying why I like Short Circuit 2 better.

So same thing here is like, I don't want, I don't want Johnny 5 running around some non-name town. Yeah, send him to New York. Have him breakdance. Oh, they're making, as a kid, they're making mini Johnny 5s that they're selling . Yes, buy me that. He's hanging out with a fat guy named Oscar. Of course, I want to be in this world with Johnny 5. Oh, you really remember a lot about Short Circuit 2. \" I Need a Hero,\" Oscar. Bonnie Tyler. Dude, those were his hands. Those are there. He go. That really was a weird movie.

It's exactly Ghostbusters 1 to Ghostbusters 2 for me. I was like , this one's good. This one is a just a shadow of the first one'cause they didn't have Guttenberg. I was so hard up on Guttenberg back then'cause he was in everything. He was great , man. Like, damn, he was good. Uh, damn, I my, I mean, my, my brain always goes to the, the, the most like, oh, we're done talking about Short Circuit 2'cause the best part, if you remember, is he's dying when the \"I Need a Hero\" and he's going and then he, he does, he, he suction cups, Jesus Christ, the wrecking ball .

So good. Oh, and aren't they rebooting? That's true. Just the spiritual success. Don't steal my other favorite robot that's coming up in this. Okay. Oh my God, Short Circuit. What you about to say, R2? I was going to say C-3PO and R2 are obviously the two most iconic. I don't know if they're my favorite robots though. They don't really do stuff. No, I mean, R2, he's a G.

He was talking. 3PO's annoying. Sure. R2 is, R2 is much, R2 is Droid though . None of the success that they experienced with the X-Wing, especially Luke or any of the guys, Wedge, would have been impossible that there are two units.

The Toasters can't. First you got to give him a shout out and the Raiders, of course, too. I'm gonna give probably the most iconic robot in my brain from the 80s, Optimus Prime. Yeah, exact.

I spent my entire formative years terrified that someday someone was going to come from the future and not stop until I was dead. That's terrifying. Why would they want you?

He's like, oh, we've been going in the wrong direction. We have no idea where we are. Like, why did you wake us up? We're light-years away from home. You guys. He looked so peaceful. Uh, not technically a robot, more of a cyborg, but I'm going to give a shout out to RoboCop. Yeah, RoboCop. He's 99% Robo. An ED-209. That terrified me when I was a kid. Also the robot, the robot from RoboCop 2, the bad guy. That was the most terrifying thing I've ever seen when I was a kid'cause the guy when he was normal before he became a giant cybernetic robot, like cut a guy open with a scalpel, like a scalpel while he was like strapped to a table. And I was like, that was traumatic to me. So the rest of the movie, he was just the most terrifying thing. Alpha 5 from Power Rangers. He's a ass, but you got to love him. I'm not familiar with this one. He says that's what he does. What was the robot",

And that, yeah, sounds like a Speedy Gonzales impression more. Yeah, I'm bad at doing it. Like as I heard in my head, it sounded better than when I did it. I was like, that's not how he sounds.

Pretty much adopted. Maybe it was a cousin that came to visit. I for, it was daughter, cousin. What? Like, was it like a blood cousin? Well, it's just a robot they made. This is what you're telling your neighbor. Look like a robot. No, it looks like who only wears the same outfit, maid outfit, all the time. And she, her head turns out. Sleeps in a closet.

She would wink at you, but the wink would be so vapid and dead behind those eyes that it would be bone-chilling every time it happens. She would wink and you're like, this thing is coming.

I don't remember this kid from the years of 0 to 10. I think we're, they adopted her. She came in through some kind of aunt and uncle got killed. Some kind of story. Made something up here.
