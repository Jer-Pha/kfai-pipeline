If you know anything about it, it's that we're a bunch of idiots and we don't know how to pronounce things. Thank you for your support on Patreon. You've done it for 3 months, which was all we asked of you. You're an amazing person. Thank you for being there. Now we all get talk. This is this table, this table, Portillo calling a little bit. I like how you introduce your dumb dog before you introduce me. You've only been life partners for the last 24 years, but Portillo takes the cake.

Who invented YouTube? Me. Now here's what I don't like, Christopher. I'm looking through your tweets and I like that you follow us, that's cool, but you have you have this photo of a bunch of Oreos and then a Chicago shot glass and coffee cup. Is that a Pok\u00e9mon ball and Pokemon ball, a little flash? God damn it, Nick, how is that a Pok\u00e9 Ball? No, that's the that's the light, that's a reflection light.
