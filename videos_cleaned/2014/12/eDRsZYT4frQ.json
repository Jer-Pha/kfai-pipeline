I think Beyonce's more than Bieber too. Beyonce is bigger than Bieber. What are we judging fame on? If you think Beyonce is bigger than her, I think you guys were all not even in the same stratusphere as Barack Obama. So I'm still waiting for you guys to to, you're talking about fame. Fame is notoriety. People know you, who you are and none of the names you're naming are anywhere near Barack Obama. So I'm waiting for you guys to hit me with something that's really convincing.

That's hard though because Twitter is hard because I think Ashton Kutcher or something like that has like the most followers, right? Exactly. I mean that's not the one barometer. There's no, there's no way to decide. That's not even a valid barometer to me. Here, here's the, here I'll check, here's the valid barometer. Okay, yeah, go to talk at me, go to Finland, talk to a six-year-old man there and say who is the president of the United States and they're going to say Barack Obama.

Then do that in St. Petersburg and then do that in Oslo and then do that in Cape Town and then do that in you know, Rio de Janeiro with all sorts of different people and and most of them will know the answer . You make a good argument. I mean it's just there's really no other answer. I if you asked any of these people if they knew all the words to All the Single Ladies, do you think they would do that?

I like things that aren't alive. Change the question a little bit. Things that aren't alive. Yeah, things aren't alive. Oh, so you're saying fictional characters? Yeah, Mickey Mouse would probably be one of Mario. The Q, the Q isn't the Q rating a really good thing to use for that? Yeah, it's like the Q scale or whatever. It's like a, it's a scale that measures the popularity of specific icons and things. Yeah, I didn't know that.
