      "text": "what's up everybody Welcome to Follow the Liter, a Kinda Funny production where we show you craft cocktails you can make for yourself or order at a bar. I'm Greg Miller and this is Master Bartender Eric Castro. How you doing folks? How are you doing? Doing pretty good. Good for asking. Eric Castro, here's my problem. I love getting drunk. Oh, I love the beer, I love the Old Fashioneds. This Devil Woman I'm dating named Christine doesn't like those things. I need a drink she'd enjoy. It can't be, you can't taste the alcohol, but it's got to taste good. What can you do for me, brother? I got something just for you, man. A Pimm's Cup. It's a classic cocktail. It's guaranteed to please just about anybody who's not into cocktails, plus it's complex enough for guys like me and you to enjoy. Oh, all right, fancy gentlemen, we're going to do a bottle of Pimm's Number One, man. They got the market cornered, some gin, and then we're going to hit with some uh fresh produce like cucumbers, lime juice, and some tasty ginger beer first .",

They got the market cornered, some gin, and then we're going to hit with some uh fresh produce like cucumbers, lime juice, and some tasty ginger beer first. We're going to do 3 /4 ounce lime juice, fresh of course. I don't care what the bottle says, if it says fresh squeezed on it and it's on the shelf at a store, it ain't fresh squeezed. What's this? A half ounce of simple syrup. Gotcha. Real easy to make, just one part sugar to one part water, make it at home, you can buy it on your own too, right? Easy. We're going to hit with an ounce of Pimm's and a good ounce of some London dry gin. Now, now this is a lot of alcohol so far and you're telling me this isn't going to taste like alcohol? You know, this stuff's a little lower in proof okay than a lot of stuff you bu you buy out there, especially than this gin, so you you will see it's a it's a very comfortable drink. It's a good way to pace yourself. All right, now here's time for the secret ingredient, hit it with a few",

All right, now here's time for the secret ingredient, hit it with a few slices of cucumber. We're going to muddle that up. W it's like a Bacardi commercial. Yeah, muddling's a good way to get flavors out of produce. Um, things like mint, strawberries, get all the flavors out. Now all we got to do is shake this bad dog up, put some ice in my glass. Now I put some ice in my tin. Remember folks, shake hard cuz you're trying to wake it up, you're not trying to put it to sleep. Look at him go. Can't really tell the but I'm actually flexing right [Music] now going to go ahead and straighten all this stuff out. I'm using a fine strainer right here just to just get all the funky little bits of cucumber out, but you know if you don't have one by all means, some people enjoy the little piece of cucumber in there , kind of com base freshness, so don't worry about it, it gets through.

Now we're just going to top this mixture off. It's a good quality ginger beer that makes me thirsty. Remember cocktail is nothing without a garnish, hit that with a little lime wheel to press the lady and spank a good mint sprig at the top, beat that thing's ass. Yeah, give it a good slap. You go folks, Pimm's Cup. All right Greg, give it a sip man, tell me for me to your approval. Do I drink out the straw to the side? What what what you mean straws AKA sticks? Well, I don't know I'm [Music] learning. Oh wow, I wasn't expecting that. Yeah, I expect to be really sweet, but there's this hint of cucumber at the end. You can taste the the lime and the orange in there that are making it not super sweet, but giving that Citrus taste there. There's reason they've been drinking those for over 100 years in England. Here's my question.",

Here's my question. You said that you know we could drink it like we not feel weird if I walked up to the the girly drinks, you know, your your fuzzy nipples and navels and whatnots always get a bad rap. Is this is this a drink that anyone can feel comfortable or ink anyone can feel comfortable drinking them actually in in England it's official drink for Wimbledon. So everybody drinks around that time. Well, there you go. I love it. Has a drink gentlemen and ladies.
