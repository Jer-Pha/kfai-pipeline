Prince of Persia: Warrior Within. Oh, on what? PS2 game? On, uh, I had it on Xbox. I stuck with Xbox for that series and, uh, that trilogy is one of my favorite video game trilogies ever. I **** love it. But what's funny to me is like, you know, I got a bunch of games for Christmas throughout my life, but that one I got it and I was just like, I'm playing this. This is the best. And I, I didn't expect it. It was a genuine surprise. Someone random got it from me and I was like, they usually don't get me Christmas presents. They did. I was like, whoa.

I definitely didn't know you knew what the **** a Game Gear was. She also get you like 50 AA batteries sat next to the outlet plugged in between that and a Nomad? Yeah. Um, when I was little though, the the Christmas that I just lost my **** was a Ninja Turtles play set. There, I had this one that was like, stop listening to The Mask sound. I just want you guys to hear this. Good Rangers. I know we're going to AOP. We're not going to cop for M. We [Music] are. All right, stop, stop, too much.

Yeah , it would launch pizzas from the top and also it had the door that swung open that like you can put one of the turtles on. That toy was just like, was great.

I me because everyone, you know, like within the universe, they all made sense, you know. I was always a little confused why like what we were saying like hundreds of GI Joes were all three and three quarters inch tall except for Sentor Golobulus and Nemesis Enforcer, uh, but I like that, you know, everyone had a different flavor, you know, that I, I enjoy. Why, why would like Kenner make toys that were, you know, viable with Mattel toys, which would make, you know, time crossovers would have made more sense. Yeah. What, what, what would make sense?

They were probably like five, five and a half inches. That's to me that is the'90s action figure internet, not internet standard, just standard. It's the best internet standard. But yeah, no, like that, I feel like all action figures should be that big. Um, except for the turtles cuz they're turtles and they should be smaller. That just makes sense in my head for some reason. Another one, another Christmas thing that I like, I, Kevin's mom got me this and it like **** blew my mind was a, um, it's a Leonardo, but it had ar, it was an armor edition and like they, it was like each, each of the Ninja Turtles had a different spirit animal and Leonard was this, was a dragon and it was like,",
