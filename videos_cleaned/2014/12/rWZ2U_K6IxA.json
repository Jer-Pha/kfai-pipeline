Uh much credit to my good friend Rory Ael who he's the guy that actually put the money up front for this baby uh for this one.

Um we've been had this mindset that making we're just going to make movies. We're going to figure out our format and do it because at the end of the day format. So, we shot this on 7D, a Canon 70D, which is uh a camera that now is probably not the number one camera to be shooting features on, but the time we're like, \"Oh, we're ahead of things.\" And we're always trying to get ahead of technology a little by making it seem like",

You can get some sort of cinematic look to your to your stuff and you can sync sound and actually shoot like a film and it would be You had to shoot 12. They shoot in 12 increments and the thing would overheat. That's funny you said that. I shot I shot a short film with uh with my good friend Anthony Caba and my good friend uh the cartoon tyroot. Um we shot it out in the Kern Valley which is central California. Hot as hell and we had to bring an ice cooler uh because the thing started over like would overheat so it put it in an ice cooler.

So there was some You're saying there was some camp in the in the Yeah. Yeah. So the original screenplay came in. Uh we were about to go into production only a few weeks into it and I'm kind of the dick here because of the situation, but basically uh I'm like, \"Dude , we can't make this movie. Like that's really stupid and kind of cheesy.\" Um and that's not saying knock on this. It just it it's one of those kind of things like there's a lot of horror",

I'm like, \"Oh, that's that's really cheesy.\" Like the movie is trying to be treated so serious. So, we had to retool the script. We like had to turn away all the crew and start an entire new crew to basically just because of the screenplay. But I'm like, the problem is this. Like, when you make a film, you live the film for the next couple years of your life. So, any any chances or choices you make, you got to stick to those choices because once you start going into this thing, going back becomes a nightmare. So you're just like you have to go forward and you have to make calls that you don't want to make but you have to. So you're saying you read the script and you were like it's going to cost me you did you do the",

We were like if we go forward this and we have to change this later down the road. It's going to cost us more than if we just retool this whole thing right now and make the crew put the crew on standby risking that maybe we won't get the crew back that we want. Cuz often times these people aren't they're not salaried employees. They're going to go on to the next thing. They're going on to the next paying gig. you're not going to pay him to wait around for 3 weeks, right? Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Yeah. Yeah. So, it was a tricky situation. We we chose to go that direction with the script. Uh turned out to be a better choice, I think, in in the long term for the film. So, it was cool.

And it's happened like I've done many films in the past. Uh we've actually got like fascinating story is back in the days we did a film one of our first feature films on 16 millimeter uh which was a nightmare to shoot on that at the time. Uh that's a film process they don't still a nightmare to shoot on by the way. Yeah. And uh we got reviewed by the New York Times. Oh.

So, the I mean, because that's the thing, like honestly, like I had no problem with the Clerks and and B Rocket because I respected Wes Anderson and Kevin Smith to death and, uh, so I was willing to take that hit at that point cuz we were like, so did you did you think it was not a great movie or was did it catch you off guard when you read the review?

Film Threat is a pretty big deal to us because that's actually how Kevin Smith and Clerks one of this big leaping moments happened when they got a really positive review film from Film Thread and uh they gave us like a four-st star review on Film Thread. Am I like oh my god. Yeah. Like that's it. Our career is going to happen. And we were just like this was like in our mid I think early 20s.

So, we're on a high horse and when the Elvis Mitchell thing happened, it took a little it took a little Yeah, it took us took us down. But that's not to say that but the Clerks didn't get all positive reviews across the board. It got panned here and there. Yeah. So, I mean it's never the New York Times but Yeah. I mean, but it's awesome. I can say I got a review in the New York Times no matter what. I can take that hit with me. So that's pretty big. Um, so yeah.

He's reviewing in New York Times. Here's my last question because I feel like looking at the time we're getting a little late. I could talk about this. Um, if the movie does well enough to warrant a sequel, yes. Can all of us be called Phobias? Can we be it? Phobias. Phobia. Dude, that's no joke.
