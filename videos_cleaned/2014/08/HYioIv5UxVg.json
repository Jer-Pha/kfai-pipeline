Uh, and that was thanks to I really got to write these down. Damn it. Well, I'll find that later . Guys, while I'm looking for that, yeah, when's the last time you accidentally farted in public? I mean, what, like accidentally? I mean, I fart in public intentionally all the time, but yeah, yeah, I I I all the time. It doesn't embarrass you? Well, but I do when people really can't hear it. Yeah, like when you're on the airplane, that's the best. Oh, I have pants. Thank you so much for that. Good great Twitter handle. Good handle. Yeah, for especially question, Colin, so you're walking down the street and you're like, uh, you feel it cuz it starts in like sort of that mid stomach kind of toward the rear end area and you're like, I got some buildup and I don't I think it's good enough to just kind of let it go.

You got to relieve some pressure and you're just like, it's a basic human thing. So before modern society, this was happening all of the time. Every time someone would go anywhere and they had to fart, they just farted, right? But we have these sort of social taboos, which are that it's really not you're not supposed to do it in public, right? That doesn't bother you at all? Oh, no, no, no one has to know. It's not like I'm walking around like in a in like a church and I'm like, you know, farting walking down the aisle to get the host or whatever, you know, it's like the body of Christ. Yeah, do the tongue there. I'm glad you do the tongue thing. Us do I us I used look to the camera. Do to the camera. Do to the camera. Do to the camera.

I never do when tongues are involved. I always keep eye contact. But no, like last week I was texting Greg cuz I was even on the Muni coming home. Yeah, and I was just I was just far like I was like I got to do it. I'm sorry. I'm like letting I got to let it go. They smell. I I definitely more so than the smell were they like did they make audible? They did cuz I could I could hear it, but I think like the noise of the train and all those kinds of things you're covering it are covering it up. Like I don't think you're you know, again, it's it's there's a difference between like there's ambient noise and and then silence. Yeah, like no one's you know no one's going to hear like the you know the rip of the fart. Sure. Um but you know what I",

But like I always walking and like just Dro to like your knees but I always think about if I'm doing it certainly other people are farting around. Sure. I I mean I will I'll if there's no one around sure why not but like I don't think I've actually ever accidentally done it. Oh I have ever I maybe in like I did in school I don't I don't remember the time when I did it never accidentally like I've never farted with an audible fart that I didn't want to happen at that time. Interesting. So you do it for humor? Well Audible for humor but mainly I mean I'll just do it when I'm like I'll fart in front of whoever the **** if I know it's not going to make a sound",

Well, Audible for humor, but mainly I mean I'll just do it when I'm like I'll fart in front of whoever the **** if I know it's not going to make a sound. I don't give ****. So the sound is the most important thing to me. The sound the thing the lingering stench in the air that smells totally blame someone else unless it's like with someone you I've seen what you guys eat and there is some rotting stuff inside. Oh my colon is just it's dark a mess. It's a **** mess. It looks like one of those caves that like they have man hasn't touched in like billions of years and it's just the lagm mites every and like creatures it's it's amazing anyone anything gets out of there at all. There have been times though where I've tried to be sneaky with the fart and then it just and it but it smells and it's like you can't you got to kind of either play it off.

Yeah, that's there there has been times where I've been alone like at my desk and I'll fart and then someone will come up to me immediately. It happens to me all the time at work. I fart and then somebody comes up with a question. I'm like Jesus Christ really like I've been alone for 30 minutes and all of a sudden somebody's got a **** question here break goddamn news. What's even worse is that at the IGN offices all of our somehow the cubicles are lined are are put in such a way that your back is always toward everything. Yeah, like I can't see anything.
