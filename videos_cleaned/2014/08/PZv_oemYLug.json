Okay, you've taken your money or your parents'money, I'll accept. What do you got for me? I'm I'm going to leave this one off, okay, because I don't know if you guys can beat this. It's simultaneously the worst and best and most awesome purchase that I've ever made: a thousand live ladybugs from Amazon.com. The reasoning? Because I could. I saw it on Amazon and I was like, no ****. What did you do with Al? How much did it cost though? It was like $4.99. What? $4.99 doesn't cost money for a thousand live ladybugs. And they came in this little box and me and Alfredo were like, this is awesome, they're alive. And then we're like, and then you punch the, that was it. We were so excited. I I didn't believe we were going to get him and we really got him. Thank you. What did you do? Let him go. Yeah, we ended up just leave like leaving him in this park near my house. Well, did this is what I would have done. I would have",

He would have done, there's 987 ladybugs in this box and three of them are already dead. I can just imagine you doing some sort of weird psychological experiment where you break them up into two groups and you give all the the ladybugs in group right everything they've ever wanted and a group left they just have to watch and just see what happens. They ever want what do they want? Like they just get like shrubs and like cool places to hang out and then shrubs and cool places group left just gets stones and they just see what happens if they can figure out how to get over to the other you know, they're all against the glass like that's everything I've ever wanted shrubs",

What the hell else do a ladybug want? Not to be eaten by a Praying Mantis. What eats ladybugs? Snakes, everything, frogs. They're kind of the bit the **** of the insect world. Yeah, they got what do they what do they even do ladybugs? Yeah, I mean like what is their purpose? Like bees pollinating crap. I don't know . We we should Amazon it though because there's obviously a purchase or like a a reason for them to be purchasable. They must I'm thinking food. You like you feed crickets to stuff. You probably feed ladybugs to stuff. I really hope you don't feed them. They're well sure crickets are hideous hideous little bastard the ladybugs actually I don't know are ladybugs cool looking if you zoom in on them? I have a feeling they might be scary.

Got a hard shell opens up and the it's trippy. I like that character Terri stupid. I mean it was a ladybug but it was a dude. I'm not a huge fan of bugs. Yeah, no, they freak me out a little bit. I don't like killing them. I don't like him in my house. Mhm. If I see a bug outside the house, I'll leave it alone. That's his habitat. I had a thing with bugs in elementary school where I liked him a lot because uh so Power Rangers, everyone knows I love that.
