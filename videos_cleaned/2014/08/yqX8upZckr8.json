He is just go to BarkBox.com slash game over and you get 10% off your BarkBox subscription. You can see that little peanut wheel in his head desperately turning as fast as possible trying to figure out how he can get up to the BarkBox. What's a peanut wheel? Just a little wheel with a peanut in it. That's exactly what it sounds like. Hanging by a thread. It's not moving at all, it's just a peanut. Portillo looks back at us and I imagine he's looking back like, hey did you guys notice there's that thing up there that's for me? I don't think you figured this out man.

Four, sometimes five best friends gather around this table each bringing a random topic of discussion for your amusement. If you like that, there's a number of ways to get the show. You go to GameOverGregi.bandcamp.com. Every Friday there's a new MP3 posted. The entire show, every topic and all we ask for is one dollar. One dollar?

The California legislative analyst office in a report that covered a wide variety of impacts noted a wide disparity of incomes and tax bases in the proposed states.

California's like, yo, we're going to break up into six so that we have all this Democrat power. Why doesn't Texas say fuck you, we're breaking up into 23 Republicans? So there's an interesting thing and I don't know all about it, I can read about it real quick but there's something in Texas' state constitution where they can split up in the states. I think five different states where there's a kill switch in Texas. I'm not quite sure what it is, I've only read about it in passing. But they can split up. The difference between California and Texas is that Texas is small government and they're doing fine. California is big government and is not doing fine. Texas is",

You don't try it that often but when I go to Mexican restaurants because I don't like to load up on chips but I love guacamole so I always ask the person hey can you bring me a side of vegetables with the guacamole so I could just because you know full by the time your entree gets there. One time they brought celery and I was like huh I'll try that and it's amazing because you don't taste the celery you just taste the guacamole. Well you still get the crunch of things when they're just vessels to get sauce in my mouth and I feel like celery is great for it because it has that shape. It has that nice little like sauce spoonie. It's like it's like nature's spork. Yeah. Really. It's good. It's real good. It's a good choice. I'm going to throw out there just for shits and",

I feel like a lot of people are talking about burgers, they're talking about steaks, they're talking about chicken. What about the fucking sausage? Why don't we, I eat a lot of sausage. Now like maybe it's an Italian thing maybe not but I eat a ton of sausage. I just feel like it's such a special food because you can do so many things with it right like sometimes I cook it cut it up put it in rice right. Sometimes I'll put it on a hamburger bun. Sometimes it'll be in my sauce. Sometimes I'll have it with my eggs. So it's a diverse food. And sausage and you can flavor it and stuff.

Right exactly right next to Tornado which is a good beer bar. And you know just they grill it up. Onions, peppers, ketchup, have some chips in a water or coke whatever. It's so good like sausage is always good. You go to a ball game or you go to a hockey game. The first thing I do when I went to the Islanders game with my dad first thing I did he got in our seats I'm going to go get a sausage. I'll pay 12 bucks for it but I'm gonna go get it.

God yes. But there's something to be said for a hot dog that's done well with the toppings of your choice like Frank in Austin Texas like Portillo's. Hopefully soon all over this great land. The other thing I want to call out for Portillo's I'll need your help on. I fuck it up all the time. To me I just call them hot peppers but I believe it's what is for peppers.

And then when I got to college my buddy Doug who I lived with one year a good friend of mine he was obsessed with hot dogs and we were poor so like he would just eat hot dogs. My thing was I would go to Shaw's which is a supermarket chain in New England and I would get pepper turkey mayonnaise and American cheese and bread and I would just eat turkey sandwiches all the time. His thing was like he would always eat hot dogs and that's when I started eating hot dogs again when I realized especially when we started getting Portillo's delivered was you could just put so many good things in the hot dog that much like the celery the hot dog is the conduit.
