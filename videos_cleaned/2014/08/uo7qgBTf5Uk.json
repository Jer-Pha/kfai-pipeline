Uh this week we're recording, so people will be hearing it a week or so after that happened. And it was very sad. Um uh you know, Robin Williams is a very uh important comedian and actor. I think a very an actor that showed a lot of range. Mhm. I think some of his best uh work was was actually when he played serious characters. Obviously, he won an Academy Award for Goodwill Hunting, but he was nominated for Dead Poet Society, too, and stuff like that, which is maybe his best movie. And some of his creepier roles I think were really interesting, too. One Hour Photo I think was like a really weird movie. It doesn't get enough credit. People always talk about it. You'll hear people I liked it a lot. I like it was the kind of like horror or suspense movie I'm I was into. You know what I mean? Like you knew this",

Uh, so I just wanted to kind of throw him out there, see what you guys think of his career and and uh some of your favorite Robin Williams, you know, moments, memories, whatever. Um, I know that when I was a young man, Mork and Mindy used to be on Nick at Night and uh that show was on from like'78 to'82 or'83, so it was even before I was born. But, uh, I used to think that show was hilarious. And it was hilarious. And that tie and the tie in the Happy Days um is cuz that's that's in the same universe, which is really weird . um with Laverne and Shirley and all that other **** too.

So right there, was it that Mork started on Happy Days or was it that they had two concurrent shows and then crossed over? No, the shows were in this, as far as I understand, he only appeared on Happy Days after Mork and Mindy was over. Oh. And I think it was that it was just the same production team, I think, and it was in the same universe. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Um, so yeah, I mean, you know, and I think about some of the movies, you know, Dead Poet Society, I was watching the Oh, Captain, My Captain scene yesterday, which is like such a poignant and powerful scene.

Jack was awesome. I remember seeing that in the theater. That's the first movie I remember I remember crying to. He was the big kid. He was he he was aging in reverse or was it just that he aged really quickly to be Robin Williams? He was aging quick. He was like he was like a 10-year-old boy but he was like an adult. I forgot what it was, but there's a scene in that movie that for some reason just resonated with me and I was a little kid, but it like it hit me so hard that I was like, \"Man, that's so sad.

It was like when we used to go to the theaters on Saturday and see two movies and that was one of the movies we saw 96. No , thank you. The other the quick aside about the movies, when I went to see Godzilla and X-Men with Christine, I was like, \"Oh, yeah. we'll go see a double feature of Godzilla. All right, great. And like that was like the idea. And then we're planning the day. She's like, \"All right, so we'll go see the first movie and then we'll go to lunch and then we'll see the second movie.\" I'm like, \"Well, no, that's what are we?\" No. And she's like , \"Well, I'll buy the f.\" And I'm like, \"What?

Zelda like put that thing and then um Rufio, I forgot his the actor's name, but like he wrote this like really heartfelt letter and just like it's so hard to read these things and just be like man like you knew them. Like this sucks that you lost somebody. Like we all lost somebody, but like you guys, you're the ones that really lost someone.

But then there's people who like know him and like family members and like that was her, you know, watching the world react let alone the people who actually know him like Zelda then, you know, gave her this new thing of like she's not going to do that. She's not going to think that anymore. She realizes what it would do to her family and her friends and the great life she has now. You know what I mean?

Uh, yeah, for me it was weird cuz it was a really long week. It's been a really long week and we're recording on Wednesday, so we got two more days. But the news sort of hit as I was doing 50 different things and I was like, that's horrible, but I don't really have time to take that in. Flash forward.

The man has been uh one of the most revered actors/ comedians since the 70s really, I think, right? Like he started doing those standups and he just was, you know, I guess it was a hard life, but he had great success and he struggled even then with addiction and all throughout these years.

I mean, maybe the thing about depression is that it doesn't make sense, right? That's the whole problem with depression is I don't even know if it's like some if things are pushing him over. I mean, people talk, you know, there's been so many stories about I'm dealing with depression or this, you know, you hear people talk about what it is and they're like cuz people are like hit a million dollars.

Not even there's a Oh, you're saying one of his house. I see your Yeah, one of his houses is in the um it's right right by Baker's Beach and it like it was like 10 minutes from the house I lived in growing up.
