The reason I ask is because, uh, there's a big thing going on in the news the last few weeks. There's a, uh, a crisis on the southern border. A lot of children from certain Central and South American countries, uh, are coming through Mexico and into the States and basically pleading asylum because they're escaping, uh, what they deem persecution and danger in their own countries. Um, a lot of them, not all of them, but a lot of them are unattended . They were basically sent by their parents with coyotes to, to come up. Coyotes, not really like an animal. Coyotes are people that are paid lots of money to guide people across the border, like sneak them in. So , um, I'm kind of curious about, like, what you guys thoughts on what we should, like, in a more general way, like, what do we do with these people? What should we do",

So, um, I'm kind of curious about , like, what you guys thoughts on what we should, like, in a more general way, like, what do we do with these people? What should we do with them? And what, what should our policy be about letting people in the United States generally? And are you afraid that, um, the, that there's a danger of losing, uh, American culture, whatever that might be, whatever that might mean, by letting in, um, you know, people from around the world, whether legally or illegally? And I, and I'll start. Um, my, my the Irish side of my family, the Morris', came here in, in the 1850s and fought in the Civil War and all that kind of stuff. So we're kind of like OG American. The, the Italian side of my family didn't come here until, um, after World War I. And, uh, so we're , we're all products of immigrants, all of us. Um, last year, I guess you're Native American Indian. Um, and I think that immigration is a really important part of America. I think that it constantly changes everything",

I think that it constantly changes everything in the United States, usually for the better. Um, we had a very, like, Anglo kind of Western European vibe to the United States for a long time, from the Revolution through the Civil War. And then the Irish started coming here and they were persecuted against, and the Chinese came here and they were persecuted against. And obviously the black population that we brought here in chains was persecuted against that entire time. And then it goes on and on and on. But what I always feel like is it always, we always assimilate these people and we take little things from their culture, um, and make them our own. Um, and I read this really interesting piece, uh, by this, I can't remember the gentleman's name, but he's a Chinese guy, he's a Chinese American, and he was saying that America is unique because a Chinese",

But what makes United States interesting and unique, whether it's Mexican American or whoever, is there, you don't go to China and find American Chinese there. There's , there's no American Mexican there. It, it only, it only goes really the other way, meaning that we have the unique position of, like, assimilating these cultures and bringing them here and kind of melting together and that is what America is. Um, so I don't really feel like there's a danger in having, like, an immigration policy that lets new people in here because I feel like we, we actually have thrived on that, whether it was the Chinese coming to build the railroad, whether it was the, the Irish escaping",

Um, so I'm kind of just curious about what your thoughts are on, on that. And, and the main problem I have with it is that what you're said, what you're hitting on is I think what American culture is, right? The Melting Pot. Obviously, you know, there aren't, uh, American or Mexican American Mexicans, right, who have gone to, or, and there aren't, you know, American Canadians, right? There, you know, there's, we're especially because we're a country founded by immigrants and we're a country that's all about immigration. And I feel like in the national",

And I feel like in the national dialogue a lot lately, especially in politics, right, that gets lost where all of a sudden we want to close the borders, we want to build a giant wall. And the problem is that it's such a **** complicated problem, right? It's so, so complicated and I wish it was easy, right? If it sounds easy when you, when you think about it, right? You're like, there's illegal immigrants coming in, stop. There's a line of immigrants or would be immigrants trying to go through the proper channels, trying to go through all these correct things with the, they have the right forms of ID and they filled out the right questionnaires and they're ready and they're trying to do it, let them in first, right? But then you have these calls for asylum, you have children being dropped off on the doorstep and what do you do then, you know?",

You have people who are wanly breaking the laws to get in and I'm not saying their, their, you know, reasons aren't in the right place or whatever. It's like, how do you balance that against the people who are waiting the right way, right? And so then it seems like there, the argument seems to be is, well, then it's got to just be turned off, right? We have to build the wall, we have to turn, stop immigration, we have to do this, we have to figure that, we have to stop and solve our problems. And of course, because we're America, there's a million other problems going on. So it's just lost in this echo chamber of problems and people yelling and p, you know, pontificating and stuff, stuff soap boxes and well, there's that, but there's abortion and there's, there's gay marriage and you know what I mean?

Like there's all these goddamn bullet point talking points that nothing ever really gets done. And so I get really offended when you see politicians out there who are blind, I feel like, to how I, what my belief and what I, what I've read about how the, the country's history is, right? And what our populace is and how we came to be, who now want to make it, you know, well, no, you can't have anybody else in here, you know what I mean? Or like, no, this is what America is. And America is constantly changing. That's why it's awesome and that's why we, you know, have great TextMe and we have all this, you know, that is why we have, I'm, I mean, I can be honest and say that I'm split on the issue, right?

A fear of overloading the system, fear of, like, maybe there one day won't be enough for everyone to go around and we have to have some sort of order to this chaos, which I think is where a lot of people, you know, uh, that's when if you're, if you're sort of sliding against immigration, that's probably where that roots from. That's probably where that stems from in my opinion. I don't think it's a, in, in me, when I look inwardly, I'm like, it's not something of saying, like, I have something awesome that I don't want anyone else to have. It's a fear that, like, bringing millions and millions of new people into the, the United States with an economy that's not exactly the greatest thing on the planet might destroy us, right?

And I can understand where the conclusion of, well, let's build a giant wall so that when people want to get in this country, they have to do it by the proper channel so we can control the influx of new blood into the country. Um, having said that, I, you know , I grew up and I worked in college through restaurants and I worked, you know, in Southern California with a lot of illegal immigrants that were working illegally. They were working under false Social Security numbers and they were, your Social Security numbers one, two, three, four, five, that would have been amazing. Uh, you know, they had different names and they were forced to sort of live in fear constantly of being deported from the country and they were taking, they were working double shifts and taking every single dollar that they didn't need to live",

And so at the same time, once you see that, you're like, this person wants to really be in this country and is willing to work really hard to do that. And I'm saying this is a very obviously isolated example because I'm sure that there's, there are people that aren't willing to work that hard. But if you're willing to risk your life to come to someplace that, that says that you at least want it enough to probably come and be a productive member of the society, maybe not, again, overgeneralizing. But once I saw that, I was like, I can't, I can't in good conscience be 100% on either side of this, right? I can see what I can see it and I can step back and look at it. Um, it's tough. It's a, it's a hard one. It is, it is a hard one. Yeah, is building a wall and just like not letting anyone in",

Yeah, and there's literally a wall too. I mean, like we, and we, I, I actually have no problem with us building the wall. I think it actually makes sense to, are you actually talking about actually building a wall, 2 0 wall you can't climb and like on, on the borders? Like, I, I, I don't necessarily think that that's a bad thing. You just have to compartmentalize them. Like, I think that we should control the border, you know, like have complete control over the border, like absolutely. The bigger issue to me is I agree with the things you're saying, like generally, like I don't believe in the nativist stance of, like, you know, no immigr, no immigration, like, um, and I don't believe in the stance, like you don't, you",

The, the, the conundrum is, like, what if we, what if the people, there were a lot of anti-immigrant people, immigration people always in the United States, always. And what if they dissuaded my Irish ancestors from coming here, my Italian ancestors from coming here? I just think that there are certain ways to, to do it. I agree, like the legal, the legal channels are, are the right way to do it. Um, and I feel bad for the people that are waiting in line. Um, it's just like, it's interesting because we do have, like, a crisis where, like, these children, um, will be sent back and probably not live very long or be, like, get really **** up is the kids, cuz it's just like these kids",

Even if they get here, right? They're growing up and that's their life and they need to figure out how to make that work and their friends can do whatever they want, but they can't, you know, and it's like they need to keep these secrets and do all this stuff and that's so **** up that they need to live that way. But it's like still a better life than, and that's, that's the hard part too is when you start at the real of the problem, it's not the fact that people can cannot get into this country, it's the fact they want to leave their own country. Why is that, right? And that's, that's, that's when it gets incredibly complex, right? Why do we have so many people immigrating from Mexico? Well, Mexico is kind of a messed up place, you know?",

There are nice spots of it, sure, like any other country. But still at the same time, it's like that, that is a problem we cannot fix. Is that our problem to deal with? That a lot of people say it is because a lot of people say that, like, the drug cartels that control a lot of these countries are, uh, sub, you know, subsisting rightfully so on American money, that, like, the drug trade is the United States. Yeah, and, like, they exist because one customer. Yeah, like the, and a lot of them say that, and I don't necessarily think it's fair to, like, pin it on us, but, like, when they say the president of one of those countries that, you know, is having this problems, I don't remember which one it is, uh, so I don't want to say, maybe",

Yeah, and I don't, I don't necessarily think that that's completely fair because not everyone in United States does the drugs. A very small amount of people actually are doing, doing drugs and so everyone has to pay. I think that the solution is really easy because you can have a humanitarian, you know, you know, a humanitarian slant while protecting illegal, legal immigration.

In the meantime, you can stay here and work and do your thing , pay taxes. You cannot have Medicare, you cannot have Social Security, you cannot vote, you can't have Medicaid or any public assistance. Like, but if we want to, like, make sure that they can't, like, that's my stance is to say, like, well, let's, let's compromise. Yeah, there's not enough of that. It's say, okay, we're not going to deport you, we're not sending you back, right? And we'll give you path to, to get your citizenship, right?

This is the same thing with, like, and I'm, I'm not at all comparing these, but to boil it down to the simplest thing, right? Like, I'm waiting in line for the PlayStation 4, right? And I've been waiting for hours and hours and hours and then at some point somebody walks out with a PlayStation 4. How did you do that? Well, you know, I just went up to this thing, knew that guy and I got, and got one and now I'm out, you know what I mean?

It's not working, right? Right. Clearly if people can just walk into this country and be dropped off on someone else's doorstep, the current system of, hey, there's a giant line over there, but by the way, there's no fence here, so just walk in whenever you want. It's like Magic Mountain, right? If there were no fences whatsoever, there were no lines, it's just all chaos, right? So you have to have order on some degree. What you're saying is actually a fairly straightforward compromise, but like let them stay in the country and let them wait and it might take 40 years or might take 30 years to become a naturalized citizen.

And I'm like, that's a little much. That's something we did in Vietnam by the way and that was because we **** ravaged that place, you know? So we went there and we're like, just come here.

But then you have to take a look not too long ago when a group of people decided, let's break the law, let's , let's defy what is supposed to be the norm and let's break away and let's start this thing and that's what this country is about. It's about if you want it bad enough, you find a way to get it, that's you're American all of a sudden, you are American, right?

Yeah, I don't, I don't necessarily disagree. I just think that a lot of it, there's a lot of racism in it, no doubt, that needs to be dealt with. Yeah, of course. Um, there's a lot of, you know, I think that again, like every other issue, there just has to be compromise . Like, you know, to become an American citizen, I do believe you need to know English.

Uh, I think that you have to pay your fines and and and do all that kind of stuff and wait, you have to wait, you have to take tests and do all that kind of stuff. Like I think that that's fair. But I also think that if you're in dire straits or you're here illegally, you sneaking and you just really want to be here and and you're pouring things are really bad back home or whatever, should we prioritize deporting you? Maybe is it better to just say, like, all right, like we're not going to, you know , do we're not going to deport you? Maybe. I think the the big issue is that and and I think it's a fine point and it's a, it's such a tough issue is say, like, well, what's stopping everyone from coming here then, right? You know , like if you, if it's just going to be fine, then what everyone should just come, you know, and you can just live here forever. And that's a good point too.

But when when children are involved, like, you know, George Will, who's a really prominent conservative columnist, he's a really smart guy, usually like an arch conservative , like a really conservative dude, he's the one who said, and I didn't surpris, surprise me to hear him say it, he was like, we should be welcoming them, welcome, welcome them, welcoming them into the country, being like, we're going, going to educate you and you're going to become American, you know, and like do the right thing by them. But it's tough because what's stopping, I don't know, it's just a bad example. What's stopping people in eastern Ukraine sending their kids here? What's stopping North Korean kids from escaping and seeking asylum and all those kinds of things? It's just a, that's when you put it like that in like North Korea obviously is, I not that they're going to be able to leave North Korea, but no",

And that's in, in that instance you think, oh my God, if they can get out of North Korea, absolutely, yeah, right? Absolutely, we should take those people in. How is that any, it's, it's a very complex issue, right? Yeah, it is, it is. And I just wanted to kind of bring that up because it's just like the zis right now in politics, it's a, it's a, the thing that really bothers me is it's such a politically driven thing, which is why I think the compromise has to be that they can't vote, um, until they become citizen. Obviously you can't vote if you're not a citizen, but you can't just, you can legalize them, you can't give them citizenship, right? Because I do think that it's all about the party that figures it out first buys those votes forever and that's why there's and that",

And we can't play political games with people's lives or be gamey, yeah, with it because that's what's happening and that's the thing that really bothers me. It's really not about them, it's about who can **** figure it out first. See, I don't think it'll be the government that figures it out. What I think it'll be is a private corporation that figures out. I feel like we, I mean we and we you see this all the time with big business where they figure out obviously in those countries, but they figure out that these people can come and they can work and they can for a wage that's well below what's considered minimum or well below, I mean anything",

Cuz you're illegal and you have the fear. So I feel like my one of my big fears that someone like someone's going to figure out a legal way to employ illegal immigrants and not have to pay them, which I know isn't incredibly hard, but if they can figure that system out, holy crap. I mean, we're a capitalistic society and money reign supreme. If you can figure out how to put to all those people to work and make a profit off of that, you've suddenly got a huge workforce. So I don't know. I, yeah, to me it's it like I the one thing I want to stress because I think it's really important is that that Chinese gentleman, I wish I remembered his name that wrote that piece, I think he actually wrote a whole book about it.
