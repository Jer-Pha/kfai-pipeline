Greg, yeah, I know you at least love Starbucks breakfast sandwiches. That's true. You've been there when I order two. I don't know what your thoughts are on Starbucks, so let's start with you. Um, I don't drink coffee, but I do enjoy like, I go there in the airport or whatever, I'll get like a muffin and like an orange juice or something like that, but I don't drink coffee. Uh, otherwise I don't really have an opinion on Starbucks. Um, it's like a painful inhale. He was ready for that one. Yeah. Uh, yeah, I don't, I, I don't know. I, I think that they're like a lot of people look at them as like a predatory kind of store, um, like a small Walmart kind of, but I think that the service is probably pretty good. The coffee, the product's good. Everyone that I know that drinks coffee likes it. So does it terrify you at all though that there's a Starbucks on literally every corner, something that",

Like I kind of wish the mom and pop stores are like some viable competitor would come out because you guys, you guys don't, you know, live out there, but in, in New York it's not quite like that. Um, York, Dunk in'Donuts. So they're Starbucks, but they're, they're definitely Dunkin'Donuts is definitely the prevalent brand. Starbucks, Dunkin'Donuts out there is like Starbucks here where they're literally Starbucks and then they're literally Dunkin'Donuts that are across the street from each other, right? It's just like hot, the traffic actually, you know, mandates that people aren't going to cross the street to get coffee here, they're going to go there, so you have to have them right next to each other.

Oh my God, that I have kept secret from all of you, but stick with me is going to I have to get there in a little bit a walk. Yeah, okay, my old Starbucks, what I knew Starbucks was of course the PSL. Yes, the Pumpkin Spice Latte. Of course, I love Pumpkin Spice Latte. If you didn't know this about me, I love pumpkin. I love pumpkin flavored anything. It's I I'm never more happy than the fall just cuz it's my favorite season because there's pumpkins because there's football because it's amazing.

PSL, I mean I was I was down from year one. I must have been going to Starbucks and getting these things, but I don't remember it all that well. That was my first initiation to it then drinking coffee for a long time. Do you mind if I ask you to go back what was the circumstances under which you had the for the first time? I was walking and I think I saw a commercial or a sign for a Pumpkin Spice Latte and I was like it wasn't like in the door you weren't like Christine didn't get you in there. I'm like you got to try this. I didn't know her 10 years ago, so no. Wow, it's good point. Yeah, so no, it was just that I knew something pumpkin flavored was",

You announced you have a Buffalo chicken pizza, here's my money, give me the goddamn pizza and I will be the judge of how good this is. Throw your wallet across. So then coffee for a long time for me, right, especi you know, was uh it wasn't an enjoyment act for a long time. It was very much a necessity. It was a fuel. I'm drinking coffee at work, you know what I mean? I'm drinking coffee at home. I'm doing it because I'm want to wake up. I want to be on point. I like coffee. I'm not like into like you know into it like now I'm into coffee now I I you know I enjoy I I like walking on the street to the mom and pop sh the Hollow here in the sunset.

But back then it's just like whatever I'll drink whatever I'm drinking the coffee at work, Senka everybody makes it different. Yes, I'm doing that. I'm making crappy coffee at home. It doesn't matter. So Starbucks it wasn't easy, it wasn't accessible. And then you talk about moving here to San Francisco, same thing there when we were out in the middle of nowhere, Brisbane wasn't accessible when it when we moved to where we are now in front of the ballpark, it's still like next door, right, still a walk or whatever.
