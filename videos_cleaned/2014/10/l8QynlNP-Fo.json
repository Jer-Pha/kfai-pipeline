And then I mean, I don't know where you want to put the music of the TV show Nashville in that because that's a that's various artists doing different things. Well, when I talk about music though, I love Strange Music. When I talk about rap, I should say I love Strange Music right now. Tech N9ne's label, obviously. Yeah, he's got I love Tech N9ne. Tech N9ne, of course, another Midwest icon. Now anytime you meet somebody, this is this is a pro tip to be in with anybody from specifically Kansas City.
