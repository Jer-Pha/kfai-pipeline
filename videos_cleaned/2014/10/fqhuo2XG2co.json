He's freelancing reviewing it for IGN and and he returned to me ease memories of S elsa on Vita and my Dual Shock 3. You **** it all up. Yeah, give it to me again. What game did you give him? NBA 2 K15. Oh, here that one's a slam dunk. God, you were on fire, man. Morard Miller, buy your shirts right now. Oh, uh, so I forgot to mention this before, but it's October now. Uh, so I want to thank everyone for supporting our Patreon. Um, I'm, you know, we're super honored and humbled by your support of of our Patreon and we want to really impress you with what we're doing. And the good news is we've been talking a lot, we've been hanging out a lot, the four of us and uh, Tim's not here obviously tonight, but you know, obviously he has great input too, very knowledgeable. Oh yeah, Tim's dead by the way. Get and I killed him. Wow, what if Tim dies tonight then we're",

Um, we're not going to tell you what they are yet, but I'll tell you one of them has to do with this substance right here in this glass liquid and uh, liquid it has to do with liquid.

So 2114. Now important things to keep in mind, uh, the race to create rockets in the pre-war era, people thought we were going to be much further, right? Obviously the rise of sci-fi, then we went to the moon in 1969 with the processing power of like a TI 89 calculator as we've talked about before. Um, yet we've never gone back to the moon since the early 70s. Uh, people thought the the NASA Pioneers in the 50s that were doing you know, uh, Mercury missions and the Gemini missions and all those kinds of things thought we would definitely be to Mars and stuff like that by now, but we're not and a lot of that has to do with just the loss of",

And I and I recommend and I I think I recommended this book, Packing for Mars by Mary Roach, excellent book that people should read about all the weird **** you have to think about when you travel in the space and why it's hard and why it's harder than you think. What how many pairs underwear to bring more like you know if how do they wash their clothes? Uh, I don't know more like but more things like if you if you're on like a long if you go to Titan for instance, a moon of Saturn, right? Very impressive Moon.

What happens but like what happens if if like they're stray liquids and stuff like that and they get in your computers? Okay, you know, like there's so like the book's all about that stuff like it's easy to think about like how you make a ship and you go to but like it's like how do you live on it, you know, and that's more like the things that they're talking about. So you should read that book. It's very good. Um, so I'm curious like what you guys think and my my thoughts are this, um, I think that we're growth in technology is exponential. We're going to go one or two directions. Either we're going to like never really go back into space again in a deep way because things are going to deconstruct here on Earth because of social strife and all those kinds of",

But I'm kind of curious what you guys think about. I mean, I think that if if you go that route, you're going to have there needs to be a a definable resource out there that we want that we can capitalize off of basically we can make money off of in order to drive a lot of our space if if if we can't find something out there that's worth actually colon or a reason why a planet or a moon would be worth colonizing, I don't think we're going to get there.

I think in that instance then 100 years from now we'll have a bunch of drones, bunch of robots that'll be out in the universe exploring for us um and then one day we'll lose contact with them and then like 200 years later they'll come back to destroy us. It'll just it'll become a sens in being like the syons sounds more like screenplay than an actual idea. It was actually it was actually I ate most of it from Battlestar Galactica truth be told. Um , I don't know if it's actually resource oriented. There's a famous quote from uh, Neil deGrasse Tyson saying about the NASA budget now um and the quote is something I'm paraphrasing here but that the that $750 billion Bank bailout that happened in 2008 that sum of money is larger than the whole the 50-year running budget of NASA like that one sum of money and with that sum of money",

Like and his argument is that the distribution of spending in the global economy today particularly here in the United States is so skewed where we think we don't have enough money to spend on things like space probes and stuff and it's really kind of stunted the growth of Mars. Like I think the problem here is that we would be a lot further along and certainly by 100 years be a lot further than Mars I would say in our own solar system if we could fix the social issues like if we could really figure out what is you know, uh stop playing for the quarterly report you know, uh simultaneously technology is moving so quickly that by 2050 the world is going to be not recognizable at all, right?

Um, Back to the Future 2, that happens in 2013 and they have like flying cars and yeah and like random dryers that just exist out in public that can just dry you off after a raid and stuff like it's nonsense. But at the same time like we have more processing power and technology in our phone than any scientist in history did um coming up to this point in a lot of these sort of technologist like I don't know if you guys read anything by Ray Kurtzweil.

Yeah, if that's the case I mean we're all be alive for that like we may be cyborgs by then we don't know really sure. Colin, here's my question for you, where are we right now with that Mars mission the one where people were like taking applications the suicide mission?

I think one of the big things we have to overcome and I think we'll have to overcome with technology is like just the rapidity of how you can get to these places obviously with our own technology now it takes about nine months to get to Mars at a certain like if Earth and Mars are close to each other obviously they can be totally on opposite ends of their orbits and it would be twice as long.
