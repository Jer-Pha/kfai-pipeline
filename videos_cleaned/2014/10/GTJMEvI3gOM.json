So wouldn't you want to like get with someone contemporary, you know, that would knew, so is it the answer Steph Hawking then? Just see, well my argument is that I'm thinking the the power of knowledge that Isaac Newton had, at least as best as I can understand it, dwarfs that of any modern scientist, maybe save Einstein, because it's it's that knowledge that allowed him to invent things like calculus. Like the the example that they used in Cosmos was that before Isaac Newton the math didn't exist to explain why the uh orbits of the planets were elliptical and not circular when in theory in all Theory they should be circular and so to figure that out he had to do something that nothing that no one",

This guy's an extreme intellect, right?

Like that's the way I look at it. But you are right, like especially in the Sciences which have come so far in such a short time, it may be more prudent to be to choose someone uh I guess a little bit more contemporary. Yeah, I mean it's just like I look at it as like a a really drastic slope, like it was like science and understanding was like very flat until the Renaissance and which point now it's just like gone like way way way way way up, you know, like in the last three or 400 years where it's absurd.

Yeah, so be, so be very careful and then the map to us is this is what my favorite part of the go we were talking about Universal languages, right? You probably know this. Yeah, the map to us is based on pulsars and like where the pulsars are located in reference to the Earth. So like we didn't, we can't tell them like literal go left dire. Yeah, like it's like it's like look for these 12 signals and like we are in the middle of it and that's like that's like so fascinating. We even draw little humans next and and and all these kinds of things and is like huge though just to intimidate him a little bit ripped like here's a tree, here's us like these guys are ice giant.

I would just paint the thumbs up sign. It's a universal sign for having you Cheetos. So it's so fun like I think feeding me I'm feeding Cheetos. Didn't they, they drew the human with his hands open to and stuff to like show like we're not hostile or something like that. There was like all these weird things you have to think about and what's so funny about how technology is coming out it's a **** phonograph record. Yeah, analog like like yeah, it's like something like where they we expected they're going to take it and put it on a **** record machine like we already like don't like like you know like we don't use them like it's they they use Digital Data.

What isn't there like a space movie or like a space horror movie that starts with an alien finding alien hope? Because that was the idea of my screenplay. Nick will tell you John joh already wrote one. I think that that I think that idea exists that it's a great idea. Well, I mean the Star Trek, the original Star Trek about yeah, Voyager where someone finds the record, they find it and they call it verer because the cuz it's no, I think that like something hit that hit it and all they can read was verer so they call they keep calling this thing this this Advanced thing verer verer verer and then when Kirk and the crew get they're like oh",
