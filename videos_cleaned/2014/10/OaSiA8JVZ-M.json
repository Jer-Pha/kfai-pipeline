And everyone else you think hates those? Hand, hand jobs get a bad rap. They get a bad rap. They get a super bad rap. Yeah, I think it's, I think Damon Hatfield famously said on a Super Knock and Boost, like hand jobs are for high school kids. I don't know about that, man.

There's not a lot of work that has to happen on both sides. Both of you guys can relax into it, or girls and guys, it doesn't matter. Uh, and you don't, you don't have the pressure that you have with some of the other sexual acts out there, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's a variety. It's, it's a variety thing, but it's also just more of like a, I mean, you can still have a conversation while it's happening. Yeah, you know, and figure out what you're going to do later in the day.

It's a quick, quick kind of fix, you know, the, but at the same time, you know, it's not the best thing in the world, but it's better than nothing. It's basically the Taco Bell of sexual acts. That's what you're trying to say. Well, it's fast, it's enjoyable, you can get it anytime you want. Get it anytime you want and you regret it later and it makes you poop. No, you don't necessarily regret it later, but sometimes they've done right, it does make you poop.

Yeah, well, there's a lot of hyperbole out there, right? Um, I feel like, uh, a good example, I'm not going to say love, but that I, I like just fine and that I don't quite understand the unanimous hate for it. This is going to be an interesting one for a lot of people. Creed, the band. Yes, thank you. Now, now, uh, Scott Stapp is obviously very, very undesirable and unlikable person. I don't think he's a very nice person. He's supposed to be super arrogant, um, and all that kind of stuff, not like a nice person to be around. But I never quite understood, same Limp Bizkit, that like I never understood like hates way more than, yeah, I agree, but like everyone, Limp Bizkit's more of a joke.

So they were just, everybody was just mean about it. They just all came on to looks as us and then didn't he get like, wasn't he feuding with Eminem for a second? Yeah, I, I don't think he was feuding with Christina. Maybe Eminem was making fun of Fred Durst. Yeah, the main lockup of course was between Eminem and Christina Aguilera cuz sitting next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst here argue over who she gave head to first.

Then they collaborated and did a VMAs award show music or like performance together and then they asked Fred Durst afterwards, why did you, like the fans were like, you're a sellout, what are you doing? Why are you teaming up with this pop star? And he said, man, what can I say? I did it all for the nookie. And then on Christina Aguilera's Diary of Christina Aguilera that she heard that, I watched a lot of MTV and she was like, no, he got no nookie. Yeah , and then I'm sure there was the feud for you.

You were like, okay, and I might be any bar mitzvah, they're just there, they're just there, man. Yeah, I, I mean, I don't deny the ubiquity of of Creed , but it's just like it reminds me a lot of like, I'm not a Nickelback fan at all, but they had a few songs that I liked when they came out. I'm never, I'm never going to hate and I, I just feel like I like those first two Creed records. I'm not going to like act like they're suddenly bad. What are the Creed singles cuz to me, I think Nickelback is the the band you go to that everyone hates. Sure, but no, My Own Prison, Higher, When You Are Me. I'm now see this.

I wasn't watching The Attitude Era. In the Attitude Era, Creed had a whole thing with WWE where they did the My Sacrifice song set to like the a good song documentary style montages of like of not Chris Jericho, of Stone Cold, Undertaker and stuff like that, categor their careers and history and all these things and they were **** awesome. Like that's why like I love that song, you know what I mean? Why I know more Creed tracks, granted overplayed, sure, they were everywhere, but they are totally the band that everybody's like, you mention Creed like blah.

Are they not stand up anymore? Sure. But I **** loved them, you know, and and like I used to think I used to think they were so good, you know, and the same thing with Creed, like I like those those couple records. I like My Sacrifice and Bullet and I think that was that was like the first track on that that third album that was like really good. Got to their third album?

I used to like this song. It's a fine song. I'm just not one of those guys that hate like something becomes cool to hate and therefore you hate it out of nowhere and I really feel like that comes happens to certain bands. I kind of get it with Nickelback because they're kind of like that singer kind like they're supposed to be really arrogant. They had that one song that was like really tasteless and **** like that.
