Um, yeah, so yeah, some time ago , and I don't quite remember when it was or what show it was , I think it was this show, we talked about meats, probably, that we enjoyed. Oh, the best meat sounds like us, the best meat episode , right? Ex Chicken. Uh, yeah, I think we said chicken. I think we concluded on chicken. Beef's pretty good though, pork's pretty good , they're all good. Uh, I want to know what your favorite fruit, fruit, and your favorite vegetable is. Your favorite fruit and your favorite vegetable. Fruit's easy for me. See, I thought it was easy. Ban aners got to go straight for the banana. Okay, yeah, bananas real good. Why, why they so good? I don't know. You could eat a million bananas. Million bananas on some Donkey Kong. Have you ever had Trader Joe's dried banana? No. They, they basically cut up like three or four bananas, they dried them and it comes in like, like basically a sheet and you just rip off parts of the banana and eat it and like you can fold it up.

No. Do that next time. That sounds like a Timy's thing though. Good, we should do that on camera. Is that going to explode in his mouth? A kid told me in grade school that would make you throw up. I never tested it, but he said it in front of the class. He told you this literally in 1992 car. I don't want to test it. I don't want to, I don't want to vomit. I, I think just ch ugging the Coke will make you throw up. No, I think don't think it has anything to do with a banana. No, that's not true. No, but bananas, bananas are the best fruit.

Continued to eat the apple until we got to the corner of Second and Townsend, I think, and then I was like, I can't eat this anymore. It's actually physically making my stomach turn and I threw it out and for like a week and a half since then, I my stomach has been messed up, but I still love them.
