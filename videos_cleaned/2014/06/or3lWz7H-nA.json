So, my topic this week, it's very important and I've often thought about this. Why are boobs so amazing? I've lived my whole life wanting to know and thinking about it because there's nothing that special about them. I think for guys, it's because we don't have them. Well, certain ones of us don't have them. Um, hide your shame. Hide your shame. Mutant. Luckily, I bought this shirt from districtlines.com/gameovergreg gy to hide my shirt. You can hide everything. It's a pretty shirt. I, you know, for me, it's always just been because I, you know, I mean, I think guys just a love bodies . Any part, it doesn't matter. And B, they're the most fascinating thing because they're probably the thing, you know, I don't know. They're just I mean, why do we love their bodies, though? Like, why is it so it's Yeah, it's science. We're just attracted to That's the whole thing, right? is",

Like that's the whole thing of like why are people why are people why are why why are gay guys attracted or gay anybody attracted the same sex, right ? It's just the way you're built on the inside as far as your biology. And there is a certain there's a certain like you know they if you study art they tell you that there is a certain like there are certain ratios that you find on the human body that are more attractive to people that we view as more attractive and oh asymmetry and all that because it's symmetrical. Yeah. Right. There's there's symmetry and there's also proportions and things like that and you follow that in in all throughout the like the entirety of any anything living like there every species",

We are wired that way just because that's how we procreate. That's what we look and say I like that. I like that a lot. We don't understand it but we instinctually want it. And I think that there's that that probably comes into the boob question as well. Yeah. Well, here's a question for Colin because I feel like you would probably know the answer more informed on this than anyone else. Sure. Um, so because I'm really stupid and I don't know the answer to this. Do everyone think boobs are awesome? No. Like I mean, well, sorry. I'll tell you who doesn't. Women. Well, okay.

In like in like other like cultures and stuff, are there cultures that don't find them sexy that aren't just like that they're awesome? I don't think so. I think like well in like African cultures when they don't like have to wear a shirt or anything like that they don't cover them up but I still think guys would like to fondle them and stuff just something to hold on to when there's something undeniably Freudian about about that situation like boob you encounter is your mom is your mother's and like and it's like there's I'm not my my girlfriend is a a doctor she's a psychologist and so she can talk a lot more about this than me bring her in but no she she won't she doesn't want to ruin her career uh like we have and I'm not sure she really to Freud but I know I was always really I",

It's like, you know, you don't find every boob attractive. You know, you don't find I don't find my mom's boobs.

You want a different set of genes to procreate with. Like, so there's there's different there's I don't know. There's different spoilers. I think it is in your head or whatever. Literally the first episode. I mean, sex is, you know, again, it's another evolutionary thing. Like we have sex for pleasure. It's another way to outsmart um mother nature or whatever.

I think dolphins have sex or pleasure and a few other, you know, higher Oh, apes. And I don't know. I think there's a lot. I mean, I think bears the core of it. Yeah. Is the fact that you're attracted to what you're attracted to. And then on top of that, I think is what Nick's talking about in the fact that it's like, ah, hey, you don't get to see boobs enough.

I know I'm open for questions. Do women actually think about guys in that way? In that in that physical way or do you do your friends and you do you ever look at a guy and go I wonder what he looks like? Yeah . Really? Oh yeah. It's fantastic. You thought that way about me? I'm joking. No. Awkward. Well, well, no. No, you're too short. Um, yeah. I don't know. I mean, again, yeah, I think most of it goes down to for guys who were just ridiculous.

You know what I mean? Like I like a flat stomach, you know, nice butt, nice legs, like pretty face. Like these are all things like I would actually put all of that above boobs.

There is that fear of if they don't look great when they're not clothed. No, never ran into that. I luckily I haven't either. Well, that that definitely happens. you get. But this is the this is the thing is like we put too much on the biology and not enough on like what we you know the teasing and like the imagination of of the female form I think is actually more attractive. I was talking about this with my girlfriend yesterday cuz we're rewatching The Sopranos which is you know everyone's asking like what show is better than Breaking Bad cuz I don't like Breaking Bad.

I I like the idea of like they allude to things like scantily clad women and then it just goes away and then you get back to the story or whatever. And I was thinking the same thing in like real life where sometimes it's more attractive to see like a pretty woman on the street and you're just kind of like, \"Oh, she's she's good-looking and and you know, she has a great body and just leave it there as opposed to like",
