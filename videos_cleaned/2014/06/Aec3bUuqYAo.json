Hence, I don't, the the sport of soccer, yes, I said soccer, when I tweet about soccer, don't correct me to football, I don't **** care. I don't enjoy this sport. I don't participate or watch it. Now here, don't even get in right now cuz that's like we're not even to the, we're on the the outer crust of my ARG, try to get to the core. Went for like 45 minutes in a meeting today. The thing about soccer, right, is that I am an American and I call it soccer. I understand the rest of the world does not. I respect that. I respect that Europe spells color with a U. I don't correct them every **** time, so back the **** up on the soccer business. So that's on the first part of this, whenever I tweet about, I, we, I tweeted the video when the World Cup",

First off, I guess I joke said in there, soccer is the worst sport ever or something. Again, I have nothing against the sport of soccer. I don't enjoy watching it or playing it. That's fine for me . Here's what's starting to get under me about this World Cup is no one will shut the **** up about it. Here's the next subtopic on this thing. I understand that it's happening and it's a big deal for the whole world. That's fine. If you have tweeted about soccer before and you are a soccer fan, more **** power to you. Tweet your goddamn balls off. Darren, Brazil, go nuts. Karon, Ty, Roo, you guys talk about soccer a lot. You own jerseys, cool. I'm glad I, I know what I'm signed up for on that front.

This would be akin to me yelling at Colin for tweeting about the Jets, someone yelling at me about tweeting about Mizzou. You understand that we're more than just one thing. So if you're soccer, that's great. What's driving me crazy about the World Cup is all these **** who have never ever ever spoken about soccer before suddenly tweeting their goddamn face off about **** soccer. Shut up. I know you don't, there's people in my Twitter feed like, oh, that was a dynamite pass. You've never **** talked about soccer. I know you don't care about sports. Shut the **** up. And so just back up about like you don't need to be talking about soccer this much. I don't understand why this the global Fascination you're suddenly like, well, I'll tweet about it now and act like I'm in like you care about it. And this all goes back to the whole like the thing",

This is another reason I'm so mad about the **** World Cup is the fact that they are making me be the people I hate during the Super Bowl. We are nerds. We get that. We have nerd friends, but Colin and I enjoy football. So on, you know, Super Bowl Sunday, we tweet about the Super Bowl. People are, oh, sports ball. For some reason, whenever sport you the **** sports are on and people care, the people who don't care about sports and our video game nerds like us suddenly have to regress and suddenly forget what a touchdown is or how to get into a stadium. They're like, wo, a football, how do they get in the seats? I don't know. I've never been. I don't like sports. Is the game over yet? Shut the ****",

But this is the problem is that I'm not mad about you Tweeting about soccer sports fans. I get it. I totally am fine with that. I want you to enjoy your shows and go watch it. I'm mad at all these Fairweather fans flooding my feet and then making it so I can't tell them to shut the **** up because if I do that, if I say that, I then become a hypocrite for the Super Bowl Sunday tweets I hate. But mind you, this World Cup goes on till July 13th. Shoot me in the **** face, Tim. I don't want to see this anymore. And so it keeps going this way.

You, I saw today, Variety tweet the World Cup game between the US and Germany was the highest ratings ESPN had ever had for a World Cup game. I'm sorry, thank you very much. Thank you. That's coming up, right? Is that what's coming up? Thank you. There you, thank you. I'm sorry everybody. I've never been in this. What's the soccer ball, football? I don't, highest ratings ever for a **** ESPN World Cup match. **** you. **** you. That proves your all fair weather fans too. Well, America's in it now, we got to care.

And I retweet it to mock you. And then real soccer fans feel that they need to tweet me and correct me that it's football and actually start explaining why the game **** off. I don't care. I am mocking you. Everyone shut about the World Cup and leave me out of it except real people who care. If you put in the work and you are a soccer fan, go nuts. Everybody else, I **** hope USA loses so soon so you'll all shut up. It's called football. How long were you waitting? There's a lot, there's a lot to unpack there. Yeah, I know there's a lot.

I'm not mad for liking SOC exactly. I'm not mad. I hope the comments are with me on. I'm not mad at you liking soccer, more power to. Well, I think the soccer fans will understand what you're saying, the real soccer fans. The one thing you said that resonated with me the most and this is one of the things that bothers me a lot cuz I tweet a lot about hockey and football, real football, not soccer, real football as an American football, real football uh is that like I should lift something.

Sometimes I'm going to Tweet about history and sometimes I'm going to Tweet about Resogun and sometimes I tweet about Joe Namath, Greg, and sometimes I'm going to Tweet about French Revolution and sometimes I'm going tweet about chemistry and sometimes I'm a tweet about planet Jasper.

And so this is something I was thinking about when I was getting all amped up about it. You this year have been talking more about soccer than ever. However, you're doing it in a way as your friend that I'm watching your feed, I see the progression, right? You started off, the first tweet I ever saw about it recently was you not understanding the clock, but that this could be a sport that would grow on you. And then your Tweet during the American game, I think was that the picture with you in a meatball sub from Ty Rud and it's like I get all that. I see you coming to the sport and I know you're a sports guy. It is the people that I know have don't give two shits about sports that are",

So I feel like I should address this topic a little bit and here's why I am that guy. I'm the guy you're talking about you doing this. So the other day I went out to get a haircut, this very same haircut. It looked good. I haven't everyone thank you. I like the sides. Um yeah, it's a little short, a little where'you go, you go, you go twos, you go. I don't even know. She does it with scissors so she can justify the exorbitant uh cost of the haircut. Fair enough. She's like, you don't want Clippers, you want scissors and I'm like, it looks exactly the same. I'm not going to get into that.

It's the biggest sport in the world. I wish I was into it. I'm not. Um on the way from my house to get a coffee first, then my haircut, I got into it because I heard the rage, like the excitement from the bar when we scored, when we tied the game and I was like, oh wow, that's really interesting. I looked in and then all of a sudden got caught up in the Z guys and I was trying to get people in the salon to like tell me what the score was and then I heard everyone like yell scream when I guess they tied it again cuz I two to one it it was two to one and then it was like, oh, we're winning and then it was lost like 1 0 seconds left which was and everyone was like, oh was horrible",

See, and those people I get it cuz it was was like Darren and Pablo and people I know are into soccer. Sean is legit into soccer. He also likes hiking. He does a lot, loves hiking, can't get enough of it and that all makes sense. I get that. It's just the people who are popping up and also I wouldn't like you're being honest about it when I was working in the Tribune in Columbia and that was last time I think there was the World Cup you were think in 2006 is that right?

Don't go on Twitter and act like you can recite the entire roster of Portugal, you know what I mean or American. All right, so here in lies the issue, right?

I'm desperate for us to do well in it because I know it's going to infuriate everyone in the world. That is literally like why I started watching it. Now I remember the'94 Olympics when it was here and remember the little dog guy, it was like a big deal. That was like I I still think um it was like a little dog, the dog guy, it was like a little people. I'm sure I know what I'm talking about.

And it is bigger than ever because people are obviously watching it, but I think soccer might be turning the corner now. There's a few, there's a few things that I I think I in complete agreement with you on this. The people tweeting at us and saying like it's football, it's football, like we said for in the United States it will never be football.

So people should go look at their history and stop telling us that we call it soccer and we're a bunch of **** when actually the English were calling it soccer first and we adopted that name.
