Nope, I don't need them because that's what Twitter's for. If you follow me on Twitter, please feel free to share your topic ideas with me and once in a while stuffing, the stuffing is out of that thing. Why this is what, see he's killing that. What Patillo does is he has all these toys that he loves and plays with all the time, but when guests come over, he eviscerates one of them to show how trying to impress me. Yeah, he is. That's a brand new toy from Kansas now destroyed. This comes from @theorSDog. The S Dog says, what film, show, book, etc. villain would you most likely be? For Colin and Greg, I'd say Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd . I know who sounds though. Am I Mr. Wint or Mr. Kidd? You're Wint, definitely. I have to look it up. We'll have to look that up. I can look it up. Mr. Wint, Mr. Kidd. Tim, yeah, if you had to be a villain here, thing is, is the question if I if I got to choose or who would I",

Tim, yeah, if you had to be a villain here, thing is, is the question if I if I got to choose or who would I most like? The question is who you most likely be. Uh, cuz like, oh, those probably like, I want to be Jafar cuz Jafar is awesome. Let's do it. Let's go. But I would more likely be Iago. Why do you want to be Jafar? Jafar is awesome. He has the, which one was Jafar? He was the Aladdin's kid. Oh, he Aladdin 3. Jafar needs glasses. What? It's a family go joke. I'm gonna go with who, who would you want to be? And also let's do that. Let's say who would you want to be and who would you most likely be? Like your ideal person and then the person you most likely. So Jafar and Iago. Okay, who's Iago? Iago's Jafar's bird. Okay. Wow. Gilbert Godfrey. Okay. Yeah, I know that. I get who do I want to be? Yeah. Oh God, just wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of a plane. That's who I want to be. Uh, who I think I'd be",

That's who I want to be. Uh, who I think I'd be someone more like the Riddler probably. You think you'd be the Riddler? Someone just genius and psychotic. The Riddler. I could see you as the Riddler. You're not eccentric enough. I want to be a Batman villain. He's pretty eccentric. Why a Batman villain ? Cuz the Batman Universe is the only interesting superhero Universe. Also cuz you're never going to die. He's always going to save you no matter what. I don't know. I don't care. I just I just want you. You don't want to be Calendar Man? Oh, I'll be Calendar Man. Here's one of my favorite Colin jokes we had going for a while that would just crack ourselves up for no **** reason at all just because we're stupid goons. But we used he used to make fun of when the Batman games were coming up the first few, you know what I mean? We talk about who's going to be in",

We talk about who's going to be in it and he'd call it call it the **** that everybody's just man, Calendar Man or whatever, Batman or whatever. He's like, does he fight Predator Man? Just the most like **** Baseline villain. Just he's a predator. He's Predator Man. He's probably upset because he knows that's a Mega Man thing. Everyone's a a blank man. Yeah, that is disappointing. Yeah, Dr. Wily would be fun villain to be. Um, but I I authentically really enjoy the Batman Universe. I like the Batman Universe. I think it's interesting. I've always been interested in it since I was a kid and I don't like superheroes or comic books at all, but I I like the grittiness and the Darkness and the realist the kind of realism of a lot of the villains and stuff like that.

Like he's not in the cartoon I guess I used to watch. I think it was real, but well he was like a big, he was, but he had the Venom, he had the serum make him big po. Like Poison Ivy, yes, couldn't be real. Freeze could be real depending on how you portray him. I'd actually really be interested to see a Christopher Nolan style portrayal of Freeze. Um, that'd be amazing. But you know, so I like I would want to be a villain in that Universe. I don't know enough maybe about the, you know, all the smaller villains or whatever, but I I'd want to be a villain in that Universe for sure. I'd be Joker. You go Joker. Yeah, just crazy, just crazy. No, Lex is, Lex is dumb. Lex is no, he's not dumb. He's actually interesting, but like it's just one of those things",

He doesn't trust this alien, you know what I mean? He wants he gu always say he just wanted to take over the world. Well, if that's cuz you just watch the **** movies where all he wants is land land create his own shut the **** up God. That's the worst. I'm want to create my own land in the comics. I mean he's really well done. I think in just the fact that he's trying to protect humanity and he thinks, but obviously there's a bunch of narcissism in there, right? That yeah, he wants to be the savior of humanity. That's really what it comes on to see.

Now sometimes he steps over the line, but he does it in an altruistic fashion. He's doing it for a good reason. He's doing it for the mutant. The toe float thing is always badass . He's not like flying like everyone else. He just chills and floats up, you know what I mean? Like and his toes are always kind of awkwardly pointed up for no reason. It's rad. Really? Yeah, if you look at the books, the way they have to draw sometimes, sometimes the way they draw them is like his toes are just like his feet are kind of like off like they're in stups weird.

Like he's not invulnerable, but in what I like about his power, you hear it and you're like, oh, that's cool, he controls metal. And then it's like, oh wait, no, you don't even understand. There's so many cool ways you can use that. There's iron in your body and there's this and there's that and I'm like, wow, yeah, that's X-Men has something special going on because they really think about that ****. But but you can put him in an environment that can neutralize that, so it's interesting. He's got depth. Yeah, but I'd probably most likely be someone like the Penguin, who has to be another great villain. I think he's kind of a lame villain. He's kind of just short. I like look that good in a suit. Isn't he isn't he supposed to be like just a a corrupt businessman? I guess yeah, that's",

I guess yeah, that's awesome. I that's what's so cool about Batman villains is that they're all just dudes dud. Like I ofad people like Nolan's Scarecrow is awesome too. I thought just a dude in a suit with a burlap sack over his head **** loved it. Like I was like this is awesome, you know, like like that maybe that's another cool character i'would be, you know, just Deathstroke's a cool villain. I like to be Deathstroke in the The Flash. He's he's fought Flash a few times. Damn it wasn't nearly as **** describe to me Deathstroke because I always get him confused with Dead. Yeah, similar. They're I mean like like but he only has one eye, right? One guy. Okay, he's like he's like he's a very serious assassin. He's not like jovial like Deadpool.

He uses swords and I'll kill people. He uses guns and he'll kill people. Okay, but he does it for money usually. He's really good in Arrow if you haven't gotten so I got Tam and Arrow and I figured that was him, but then I didn't watch the next episode cuz I can't get an arrow. A new I watched that episode when they're on the island. Yeah, got a little bit of a Lost vibe. Mm, thought the Dharma Initiative was going to pop up at any minute. The Dharma Initiative, it's the bane of my existence. 40 I wanted it to end well. I liked all of the Lost seasons except the last one. God, I wouldn't even watch it after the first two.

Got to get my boy. What? Gotta save my boy. How are you aging so quickly? All right, did we cover everybody? Did you talk about I don't think Damon got now I was confused a question super villain or just any villain? Any villain? Okay, then T1000. Oh, that's a good one. That's a really good one cuz you're never going to die, but you don't have like you don't get joy out of life, but that does that make you Skynet kind of like part of the network itself in the machine?

Remember Terminator Salvation. Greg, why the T1 why the T1000 though? Why does that draw the T800? Well, I mean Schwarzenegger was a better looking man, but I'm not Robert Patrick. I guess you I guess you could look exactly whatever you want to look, right? You could be right now I'm gonna look like C Owen is what I'm going to look like. I thought you'd say a hot girl. C Owen C's a good looking he like yeah, what was the Terminator model in Terminator 3? Oh, the girl. Yeah , but I mean the T1000 can just be anything. Christina Loki he he can look like whatever.

Would you be like I got probably do some groping. What is this? You got you got to check it out, right? Well I mean like you're a robot, right? So it's not like it would have any feeling. I'm saying you would you would kind of be like devoid of all emotions like unless you had a mission you wouldn't have a point. If you were the T1000 you just be cool like you do cool stuff.
