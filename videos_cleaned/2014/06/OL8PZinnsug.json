The pure one, Tim Gettys, glad to host and the host with the most, Daemon Hatfield. You're our special guest this week. Thanks for having me. Now as everybody knows, the GameOverGreggy Show posts every week. It's four best friends gathered around a table bringing a random topic of discussion for their amusement. This isn't that. Instead, we're going to play Guys Ultimate Battle. It's a card game being Kickstarted right now. Actually my favorite board game of all time. Whoa, there's no board out of the ringing endorsement.

The idea is to be the final person standing. Now here's the thing about Ultimate Battle, you'll catch on as we go. The first things first, I'm the realest. Second things, we all need to draw on this piece of paper here which is a Kickstarter reward by the way. If you go and you bid on that paper, you know, you get this one. We're gonna send this back to them. Oh yeah, we all need to draw an avatar for ourselves. Okay, I love that. In this in this Ultimate Battle, you need a marker. Yeah, can I get the purple one? Yeah, there you go. Perfect avatars or the no not a blue avatar, whoever you want to be in the game. Do I have to be Sam Worthington's character from Avatar? It doesn't have to be related to them.

You draw a Terminator, somebody else draws a marshmallow, it doesn't matter. They're equal. Yeah, okay, we're just drawing our avatar now. Yeah, I'm gonna so I'm gonna draw that and then we're gonna deal out the cards. The idea here is that it's a one hit kill battle. You're gonna go and battle each other. We're gonna go counterclockwise after we do this then we just tell stories about the items with our characters what are our characters doing with it to thus kill the other person. Love it. Then if we get in an argument there's these agreement cards that are fun but here we go. Okay, secret avatars no nothing secret here.
