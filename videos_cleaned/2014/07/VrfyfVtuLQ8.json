What is the thumbnail on this one going to be before we start talking? No, like beards that like hide if your sexual orientation. Oh, I'm talking about Tim, not that deep. He means I don't know what you just said. What the hell are you talking about beards? That's a common name for if you don't want to come out of the closet, your beard really? I never heard that. Really? No, you live really? That makes a lot of prior conversations way more contextual. I'm a beard and you're like, you don't have a beard. What are you talking about? No, yeah, generally if you're if you're a gay man and you have a wife, she is your beard covering makes you manlier. Yeah, it makes you it makes people think you're straight, you're in theet, you're hiding something interesting. I've never up I've never heard that. I think you made that up. That's okay.

Yeah, so what are you what are you guys thoughts on beards and specifically the I the internet's cultural fascination with them? This is back to what we're talking about. Well, first off, my own thing with beards is I've never been a big fan of facial hair in general and uh this is a funny story because once uh you know you can grow a facial hair by the way. No, well maybe not. I could I couldn't have back in back a few years ago. What you know what you smell it's going to be super weird. We have to do if we ever take like a a week off of filming stuff then yeah, I would here's the thing.

He always had a mustache. Got it. That's how it is. You know what I mean? And I'll never forget this one time mom was reading People magazine and came into an old photo of Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd before Ghostbusters when they were still doing like Second City stuff right? And they had mustaches and my mom's like look and I was like ah she like what? I'm like I just don't like mustaches and my dad's like what? I'm like no, it's like and then you can't express it as a kid, you know what I mean? That's just how my dad was. But for me, I've never understood the fascination in general.
