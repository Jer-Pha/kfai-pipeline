It would taste really good the way she made on Wonderbread and every once in a while I can capture the taste of it by combining those ingredients, not every time, but sometimes where it brings me back where it tastes like the way she used to make it and I don't know like what it is about that or whatever, but balance, like that's the thing.

That's good too. That's just untoasted toast. Yeah, that's genius. But eventually I came around on Peanut Butter. I like them fine together now. I'm going to leave you with these two things that you can do with toast, another underrated conduit, right? The first thing is you can just put butter and jelly on the toast , grape jelly and then put your eggs on the toast and eat it that way. Very good. You should talk to my wife. That is how she eats her eggs. That's yeah, that's how I do it on a diner whatever and people look at me weird when I go to like a diner or breakfast spot and I get the toast and I get like whatever I put the scramble on there but I'm not a fan of the jelly on there already.

The other thing that a lot of people don't do that's underrated is toasting the bread, buttering it then putting that cinnamon and sugar on it than just and just eating it like that. That is so good. It blew my mind. I we've told the toast story on here before where I heard it on This American Life. There's this place in the Sunset. Nobody goes to it's the Sunset. I'm like Sunset like this place that does toast. Yeah, yeah, hold on. I haven't heard about this place. Explain. So I'm listening to This American Life one day in here editing our videos.
