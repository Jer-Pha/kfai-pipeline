I want to know what sitcom character you hated and now I want to make it very clear we've talked about ha trolls and everything else on this show before. I always tell that story about The Office when I almost tweeted how much The Office sucked it or whatever in that second or last season. It got good in the final season. I don't mean actor or actress. I mean character in a show you hated and I will always go back to Jill from Home Improvement who was a terrible wife and a terrible mother. Jill from Home, why was Jill and from Home in a terrible wife? She was annoying all the time because she lived with the dude that was like this , that's all he did. Guess what, **** you married him and kept having sex with him. Maybe it's Tim the Tool Man Taylor was, maybe it was just a mechanic when she first met him and he was a nice guy and then all a sudden the show and now guess the world's most annoying human being you live in Detroit you're on he's on. I would argue that Tim is more",

I think Jill and Al were banging. No, had that girl I'm putting that out there. No, that's not true. That's not what it was.
