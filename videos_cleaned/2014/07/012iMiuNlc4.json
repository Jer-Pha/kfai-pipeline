So I assume that this is it. You want, yeah, you said the two fragile ones. Sure, of course. Greg gets the boxes. This fragile. He dog, there we go. Oh man, daylight at the end of the tunnel. The fruit punch. Oh my god, without doing the patented oration first, look, I can't tell you they are intact. So the fruit punch made it. Damn, the rumor on the net is that these are terrible. They don't look good. Yeah, man, fruit punch artificially flavored. I didn't know there was a a normal fruit punch natural flavor. Yeah, truth, there's",

I feel like those, I'm calling it right now, those are going to be the winner, the watermelon, that's 9.5 right there. Okay, the second items are six cans of Bush's Grillin'Beans. A a little while back, Colin said if someone sent in Bush's beans to the show that Greg would eat them on camera. I didn't no. So here you go, one of each flavor. Enjoy. That's disgusting. Did he send a can opener cuz I can go get a can opener. Oh, Southern Pit Barbecue, that's extra smoky right there. Cooked black bean Fiesta. Wow, it's like it's like Mexico in your mouth. Texas Ranchero. Oh, I'm that one. Texas T into Texas in your mouth. Steakhouse recipe. How many are in there? How how heavy was this box? Bourbon and brown",

You should have made it, you should have made a if protest , ask the audience. I'm protesting right now. No, if Greg said this on camera, I didn't say this. He said someone, he said, Colin said if Greg said it on camera, everyone tell us. I didn't. This is unusual. This is unusual. I feel like there might be some confusion here. Mhm. He said the bourbon one is his favorite. It also is the OG Bush's Grillin'Beans flavor by the way. Okay, I like he use OG and trill in in this letter already. All right, the third items are two cans of Coke for Colin. Now he says, I needed to fill up space in the box and I know Colin loves his Coke. Now I do love",

So I just didn't know if it was also since there are cans, you don't have to worry about them going flat overnight. So so long as you your can I have Fai that you the two liters. Yeah, yeah, no, I understand the confusion, right? Right. I just want to make sure. As for Tim and Nick, I have nothing else to offer you but my love. What what is this person's name? Richard Gordon. Richard Gordon. Your love is enough love. So I enclosed two photographs of me blowing you each kisses. Good Lord, that went from like awesome to a to oh my God.

Man, and he drew a little heart too. I in case I didn't know. Nope, not going to be able to see that. Tim, hold yours up. I'll zoom in. How about that? Stand by everyone. He has a nice kitchen. I like the stash. There's sign to you're welcome. He says, there it is. Wow, this is a crazy ass package. That's good , Tim. Okay, there's more for P. I threw in a squeaky tennis ball. Oh my God, it's so small. P's a small dog, but it's a little tennis ball. I also have a dashen or daxon, but don't worry, it's a fresh tennis ball. Thank you all mely for what you guys do.

A much love, Richard Gordon at babby 30009 at babby y39. How is babby formed? Oh, he has a picture of his docs in here. He says, here's a picture of me and my wiener. His name is Duke , you know, like the King baby. So the picture is not coming out very very good. It's all dark. I can see it's cute. Uh, PPS asked him if you would deflower Rapunzel from Tangled, the version of her at the end with short brown hair. That version of her is the top of my list. Okay, both of those good calls. I don't know which one I'd prefer though. Are you guys familiar with no, but I'm more of a brunette fan.

Well, her and some like their car just flipped another bus full of nuns dead. That was a really nice surprise. So now we'll have uh not in your **** life. If I do that, if I eat a spoonful of beans, you eat a spoonful of mustard. Oh my God. Yeah, that's going to have for must. It's disgusting. I don't no, you'll eat anything. I'll eat a SP full of ketchup and mustard. Eat one of the batteries I just bought $5 at the little store. I don't think I can eat mustard. I don't think I can eat that . I'm not convinced.

We put a little bit like here's what you should do is eat them cold. That way it's not like the warm flavor in your mouth. Maybe that would help a little bit. It's still diarrhea and vomit is all it is. I don't think it's either of those things. This is flavors here, dude. Read me the bourbon flavor what's and brown sugar. Doesn't that sound delicious? It's like a poptart for adults. No, that's even that you somehow made it grosser. I think you going be as a poptart. No, by the way, there's enough there to fill up a small bathtub for you to bathe in if that's if you want to do that instead. No , I don't want to do anything with these. I'm not pushing it on you.

I don't have a problem with the logo. I mean it looks like it looks like Picard's face palming. Yes, we've all seen this. It looks hide it looks like uh hands are coming out and and and dragging the ball to hell. That's true. That's what it looks like. It's terrifying to me.
