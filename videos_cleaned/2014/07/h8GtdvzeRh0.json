That's that's not hey, that mirror at what point does the window become a mirror when it's 100% reflective rather? I think that's that's the opacity over there. The opacity on that is probably at a 10% right there. That's a that's a window and it's only because of the screen behind it that you can't really see through it. I can see your screen really needs to be clean. You see all the dust on it. Yeah, you can see how Mike left it open all the time and that's what happened. What an **** what a jerk.
