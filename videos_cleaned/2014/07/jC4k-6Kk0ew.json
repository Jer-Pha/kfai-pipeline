    "description": "Going to Greg Miller's favorite restaurant of all time for the first time? Here's what you HAVE to order at Portillo's.\n\nWhere is closest Portillo's? Find out: http://www.portillos.com/portillos/locations/\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=gameovergreggy\n\nBuy our shirts! http://www.districtlines.com/gameovergreggy\n\nFollow Greg on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\n\n---\n\nHey--\n\nAs many of you know, my favorite restaurant on the planet is Portillo's Hot Dogs. Hell, I bought a wiener dog like the one in the restaurant's logo and named it Portillo.\n\nIn 1963, Dick Portillo started his first hot dog stand -- the Dog House -- and over the next 50 years, it has spawned into dozens of locations around the Chicagoland area. There are even a few down by LA, one in Indiana, and a couple in Arizona.\n\nAnyway, as much as I talk about Portillo's, one of the most common Tweets I get is what a visitor should get on his or her first time. I try to respond to each Tweet and even have blasted the order to all my followers with the message \"FAVORITE THIS TWEET IF YOU'RE EVER GOING TO PORTILLO'S,\" but the 'What should I get?\" Tweets keep coming.\n\nNow, I can just send them to this vlog. Below is the order. It is a lot of food and not my regular order, but it's the order I suggest for \"This is my one and only time at Portillo's.\"\n\n1) A hot dog with everything.\n\n2) An Italian beef with hot peppers and mozzarella cheese.\n\n3) Cheese fries.\n\n4) A chocolate cake shake.\n\nNow, if you're a Chicago native and are warming up to comment below that Gene & Jude's is a better place or that visitors should go to Wiener Circle, STFU and GTFO. Portillo's is home to me. Period. When i go back to Chicago, it's the one constant. Walking into the place reminds me of after-school lunches with my grandmother, when the North Ave. location caught fire and my parents woke me up to go watch and mourn, the same order I've been placing (two hot dogs ketchup, mustard and pickle only) my entire life.\n\nI'm not a hot dog connoisseur -- I'm a Portillo's devotee, and I always will be.\n\nGreg",

I'm Greg Miller, and I love a restaurant called Portillo's, and I get a lot of tweets saying, \"Hey, Greg, I'm going to Portillo's for the first time, what should I order?\" So, ladies and gentlemen, these are the four things every Portillo's first timer needs to get. So the deed is done, the food is here. It's time to show you the four items you have to order from Portillo's on your first visit. Number one, it's the chocolate cake shake. I'll open it up. There you see it. It's a it's a milkshake, but then it's got Gina's the chocolate cake ground up put in there. That's what it's all about. It's it's a delicacy here at Portillo's. It's delicious. M and immediately you get a giant chunk of chocolate shake, chocolate cake in there. It's actual chocolate cake chopped up put in there into a milkshake. It's goddamn amazing. But here we go, the Cuda G, we get right going. First off, of course, this is Portillo's bag. This is what I grew up in. This is how you knew you were a true Chicago kid if you brought the leftover",

This is how you knew you were a true Chicago kid if you brought the leftover bags were used to bring your food to school in a lunch bag. It's amazing. So here you go. First off, I ordered a french fry. Comes in the delicious little Portillo's uh french fry container. Of course, about him though, this is your first time. This is your first time in Portillo's, you got to get the cheese. Now, of course, there it is. Is that what kind of cheese you might ask? Is it? I don't know. It's it's like one of those it's one of those made up cheeses. It doesn't matter that I don't know if it's cheddar or American. I just know it's delicious and amazing and I want to eat the rest of my life. So those are two things. We're halfway there. But now we get to the heart of the matter. You're going to Portillo's.

The logo is a thing that says for hot dog. You have to get a hot dog. If it's your first time at Portillo's, I'm assuming once again, you've never had a Chicago hot dog. Chicago loves its hot dogs, makes a big deal out of them. There's a very specific way to make them. You got to get a Chicago hot dog. You got to go up there. You see, you want the Portillo's hot dog and you want it with everything. That's the standard Chicago style for a hot dog. You get the poppy seed bun, it's steamed, you get the Vienna beef frank in there, you get onions, you get the relish, you get the sport peppers, you get the pickle spear, you get your two tomato slices, then you get a little bit of mustard on there. The big thing then they added celery salt. This is a trick of the trade. They call their seasoning. You put it on there. It's delicious. Here the thing about Portillo's is you're allowed to live",

Here the thing about Portillo's is you're allowed to live your life however you want. I'll tell you this right now. It's a confession. It immediately means that I'm no longer a Chicagoan, but I want you to know when I go to Portillo's and I'm not giving you the order you need to order, I order two hot dogs, ketchup, mustard, and pickle only. I know if you're a Chicagoan, I've just been disassociated with you for the rest of my life. Ketchup does not belong on hot dogs, they say, but I don't care and neither does Dick Portillo. He's an amazing man who made an amazing house to being team fat and it's awesome and so he'll let you put whatever you want in there. I got to take a bite. Oh my God, it's one of those things I don't do often, the everything, but when I'm do I'm so happy cuz you know I'm not a big fan of the onions, but when they're mixed in there with the relish",

It's it's a meal amongst itself. But again, you could just add get that you could just get the chocolate shake, you could just get the cheese fries and be done and say that's enough . But ladies and gentlemen, you only live once. You're at Portillo's for the first time ever. You can have acid final thing coming out of the bag, one of my favorites, it's an Italian beef sandwich. Now you can already see the grease from the Italian beef, the gravy leaking through . Remember that Simpsons thing where Dr. Nick said if it turns the paper clear, you know you're on the right way to weight gain. There it is. You can see my fingers through it. You know you are in trouble town, but it doesn't matter cuz it's so good. Now the Italian beef normally would",

Now the Italian beef normally would just be amazing spiced beef sliced put on an amazing hogi roll for you. I say that's not enough for me. So what I do is I put on a whole bunch of hot peppers. I say I want the hot peppers. You can do sweet peppers if that's your thing instead. I go hot peppers and I also put in mozzarella cheese. Now if you get a look at it, you can see how gross it looks, but how I can I'm going to have to tell you here in a second how amazing it tastes. Let get right in here. Like your initial reaction obviously is like I know my face is covered in juice. I don't care. The second reaction is this beef tastes really good. Second reaction, oh, there's the hot pepper, there's the cheese. They get together and they just dance for you in a symphony of flavors that is it's a thing of beauty. I I love this restaurant more than I",

You get the Italian beef, you get it with hot peppers, mozzarella cheese, you get the cheese fries, large or small, your choice. This is a small. You get the hot dog with everything. You get a chocolate cake shake. This is for you to go and get the best possible Portillo's experience. This is what you want. This is what I rave about. This is what I name my dog after. This meal is the key to living the right life at Portillo's and I hope you do it. Ladies and gentlemen, make sure you tweet me your photos of your first Portillo's meal and then for everything about nerdy conversations every day, keep coming back here to gameovergreggy.com.
