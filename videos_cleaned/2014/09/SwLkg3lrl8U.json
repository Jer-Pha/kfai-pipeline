While that happens, does someone's farts or burps smell like trash or is it the trash in the kitchen? Every so often I got a waft to trash in here earlier. Go to our Patreon page so we can take out the trash. I think it's the trash. Okay, it might be the trash. It might be one of us. Uh, so my topic today, of course, comes from the community. Remember, if you uh have a topic for this show, uh please tweet it at me, Nick Scarpino, and it might be one of our topics just like @DancingJoMan, DancingJoMan who last week won a very, very landslide vote for the two topics we had. Uh, remember we usually put up two topics for Nick then you vote via likes through through the YouTubes, right? Since the schedule's a bit off this week because of the Kinda Funny relaunch, we won't do that this week. Instead, you can pick topics and we'll vote at the table. Yes. So, but who won last week?

Yeah, what's the craziest party you've ever been to? Well, I've thought about this and I don't think this reminds me of Aisha Tyler when she was here and we were talking about, you know, whatever the hell we were talking about. I said I said I said my stories are too are too incriminating. Uh, so this is going to be hard one to not so I don't want to incriminate anyone else. I'll incriminate myself though.

Um, this was this was not the craziest party I've ever been to but it's the funniest story I have about going to a party. I was like 19 or 20 um and I I went to like a little get together at my friend's house on Long Island. I was home for the summer from Northeastern and we ended up getting like just super wrecked and we were having a great time. We hadn't seen each other all year. Everyone's coming home from college. I think this is like after freshman year and uh so we were we were just having a good time at my buddy's house, you know, swimming in the pool and drinking some beers and hanging out listening to at 19 years old. Oh my God, you're a law breaker and uh you must have just been smooth. Oh yeah, but so short short short story we're all in the backyard of my friend's house and I end up passing out in the backyard um and everyone just kind of you know",

She's like, what the hell are you doing? And uh and I and I like and I like I was groggy and had never really been that drunk before uh and just got up and and slept on their couch or whatever uh and woke up like 7:00 that night and went home. So uh a lot of my college stories are very similar in the sense of how messed up I ended up getting but that particular story I think is the essence of the first time I got screwed up and the party wasn't even much of a rager as much as I raged too hard at the party. So you were that guy? Yeah, oh yeah, probably. I remember like the next Monday everyone's like Colin was",

Yeah, so that was just a that was just that story always sticks out to me just cuz I remember my mom my friend I was so embarrassed cuz my friend's mom was like who I've known like most of my life, you know, since I was a kid like a little kid like was like me what the hell are you doing face down in the grass the backyard imagine you like destroying your friend's dad's bottle of Peach schnapps and then just being like why isn't 311 playing right now just stop we're going to get we're going to get strike I can't believe I get so that so that's about as vanilla as I can make it without you know I don't want to get you know college parties were a lot of them were pretty absurd uh",
