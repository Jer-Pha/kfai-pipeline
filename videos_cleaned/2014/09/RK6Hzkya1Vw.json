I, my topic normally comes from the community, but since we didn't do one last week and because we're all out of order, because we had, there was so much going on last, a lot of Patreon stuff, guys, but we're going to get back to it. Uh, I thought up my own topic today. Um, this will probably be a very quick one. Uh, but remember , if you have topics for me now that everything's sort of settled down first, please, uh, go, if you want to support us at patreon.com/kindafunny, but then follow me on Twitter, Nick Scarpino, and let me know what your topics are for the show and we will choose between it, between two topics every week. Remember, you can still go to Patreon of Funny and you can get the perk that just guarantees your topic on the show. That is true. That is awesome too, because we're trying to add a fifth topic. We are. Uh, we're GL for, which would have been a sixth topic today. That's a long, we'll see what's going on. That might be a goal. We should do one show that's 24 topics. Yeah, 24 hours.",

It's something I've always wondered, if you had the opportunity to be Justin Bieber, would you be Justin Bieber? Yes, it's something that I've always wondered, would you be this 20- year-old on the car right over, on the car right over? It's something I've always wondered. No, I mean, this the kid has a great career, right? But he's taken a lot of flak lately. He's been, uh, you know, the first thing about what was six months ago, he got caught in a Brazilian, uh, wh house coming out of that. Like they took the pictures of him and he's like, he had his little cool ball capab down, but you can still tell it was him cuz he his little legs and then, uh, and then he got punched in the face by Orlando Bloom, like punched out by Orlando Bloom right after Comic Con and I had just seen Orlando Bloom and I was like, dude,",

I'm like, man, punch me in the face, Orlando Bloom, you're so beautiful. I'm British. Um, but the kid's taking a lot of flak, but he's super talented, right? So I'm going to, what, he's millionaire, but you know, he's going to self-destruct. Knowing all that, would you be him? Yeah, so he's already self-destruct ed. I mean, he's on that thing, but that's kind of what he was from the, not from the beginning, but from almost the beginning, he was, you know, that that self-destruction Hollywood whole thing. But I think everyone hates him. You know, it's like an easy win to like make fun of Justin Bieber and everyone jumps at him. I'm not a fan of his music.

Like he can actually play a lot of instruments, like he plays guitar, he plays drum and he can do all these things that takes skill, you know, and it's it blows me away in people like, oh, he's a talentless little little prick and blah blah blah and I'm like, he's probably a little prick, but he's not Talent. He's Got Talent. He's Got Talent. I mean, the thing about, I mean, the answer is for me 100% yes. Yeah, of course you'd want i', but wouldn't you?

Oh my God, where he's like telling the lawyer off and don't talk about Selena even like a deposition. I'm what do you mean he being deposed? I don't remember hats, hats he got a hat fight, wear hats, he wears those pants he wears like they're not pant. If I can't change it, then no, I guess.
