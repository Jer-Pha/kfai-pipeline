You don't sit on the sidelines being some twerp. the you know you know I I'm in a committed relationship and I love my girlfriend very much. But my my success story was once me and Mike Mitchell were out at the at the bars when I was single and there were these two girls who walked and sat at the bar and we I was like hm Mike I'm going to buy those girls shots. We're going to have shots with them and Mike said I don't know and I'm like no we're going to do this. I brought the waiter over. I got shots for them. I got shots for us.",

No big deal.\" Took the shot, did our shots, then they turned back around, came back like, \"Oh, you took your shot. Yeah, we saw you laugh like, \"Oh, no.\" And then they sat. We hung out the rest of the night. You just got to own it. It worked. Confidence. See , that's the thing that Tim and I didn't do when we were at a bar and Nick sent those two Asian chicks our way.

What I used to do, and I think we've talked about this a little bit, but I I love talking to people, even if it's failing at doing that.
