I'm Greg and this is my roommate, Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff, so every Tuesday and Thursday I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at him, we talk it out for your amusement. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to us on YouTube, share us with your friends. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is American Pie, the greatest quadril in the film history. Quad, is that, is that quad? This was submitted by Jason Green. Colin, we love this American. Why do you love American Pie? Why do we love American Pie? I think about it, I distill it in this way, right? Every generation has their teen movie, right? Like in the last few generations anyway, when, when this was a thing. And I think when you think about maybe uh people that are 10 years older than us or so, they have, or maybe a little older, they have the John Hughes movies, right?",

And they have like Breakfast Club and those kinds of movies and they have their own comedies like Back to School or Caddyshack, these, these movies that have an essence to them, right ? And in the 90s, maybe the people just a little bit older than us have, even though we love these movies, have like the great Adam Sandler movies like Happy Gilmore or, you know, uh, you know, films like that. And we have American Pie, right? And I think that our Coming of Age teenage movie, I think American Pie's humor is actually really underrated. I, I think that that series is underrated. Now, there are problems with all the movies, but American Pie is really funny, uh, hilarious and, um, really well written and the actors are good and I care about these characters .

That's why when we saw the fourth movie or whatever it was kind of cool to see them. It was funny. I like, see that's what it was for me, what you're talking about, right? Like these, these we connect with that cast and the fact that when the original American Pie came out, there were just a bunch of dumb kids in high school, we were just a bunch of dumb kids in high school and that was the reason, like you started to think of them as your friends, right? You can see pieces of your friends in what they're doing or what's happening with them. And so yeah, you're immediately endeared to these Jason Biggs and whatnot. And then yeah, to see them grow up and you know, keep going through similar life experiences as you go and then finally to get to the, you know, just the ultimate movie of all time, American Reunion, good Lord. Yeah, it was, it was fantastic. It was, it was, F, I mean I",

Yeah, it was, it was fantastic. It was, it was, F, I mean I can't really explain why because I mean these characters aren't necessarily extraordinary characters. I think the character development movie like Breakfast Club is much better than, that's a bit more based in reality. Yeah, but there's something funny about the trials and tribulations especially in the first movie that they go through that everyone can kind of relate to. And I don't mean, I don't mean like the getting caught on camera with a beautiful supermodel kind of thing, but you know, like the whole, you know, really invasive camera stuff you'd go to jail for probably in real life. Yeah, yeah. Um, but I, uh, I do appreciate the whole , you know, like guys obsessed with having sex kind of thing. Like that's just the way, like that's just kind of the way it is when you're in high school, like that's",

I mean real, we talk about Breakfast Club really being grounded in reality, well that's kind of grounded in reality too. These four friends that are, you know, five I guess with Stiffler, right? That that, uh, are obsessed with women, like girls. I mean that's the way you are when you're 16, 17 years old and you know, the house parties they go doing all these things and like how they talk to each other and they kind of support each other and it's kind of cool and there's something endearing about it, right? Um, the evolution of the series I think was kind of a little strange up to the wedding. I think they kind of pushed it maybe a little too far. Stiffler obviously is like such an amazing character, but he, but he went over, this is one, this one of my favorite things is like before American",

We're not going to Band Camp or things, those great. I'm glad they exist and somebody's getting money, mainly Eugene Levy, he's getting a lot of money from being in everything. But when you talking about the theatrical releases, right? I, you, we, you told me that Stiffler is the best character at one point and I was like, Stiffler is not the best character, he gets more and more stupid. He, he some, he becomes like a functioning just mentally handicapped person by the end of, you're like, no he doesn't, no he doesn't. And then we watched it, you're like, oh man, he does.

In in episode, or episode one, in the original American Pie, yeah, he was just a dick, right? That's all he was and that was fine, that's all he needed to be. So yeah, like I, uh, I agreed with you after that, you were right, but I still think he's The Great Character and I often get into an argument with my girlfriend too about Tara Reid who I was like so incredibly in love with after the first American Pie, like so hot, you know , and then she just went off the deep end too and she actually looks okay in the new American Pie, yeah. Um, but like man, she went off the deep, time wasn't well to her. No, well she",

She was like really, really hot, like, like, um, American Pie 1 and American Pie 1, she normal, everyone in American Pie 1 is a normal person. That's the thing about it. They all, they were all like no-name actors who just like were in Wisconsin or around there and got cast this thing. Apparently they couldn't afford a makeup person cuz everyone was oily and shiny the entire movie, which again was kind of endearing. You're just like, oh whatever, it's fun. So I don't know, uh, I, I, I enjoy that. I don't think they're the greatest films of all time, but I think that there, there's something to be said for people our generation that, um, it's like a Coming of Age kind of thing for us and, uh, I think people can relate to it that are our age maybe in that respect the same way and in a way that",

It doesn't mean I don't love those other movies cuz I do, but like they make me nostalgic especially John Hughes movies for a time I didn't really get to experience, yeah, which is powerful in its own way. But um, yeah, I don't know. I, I think the American Pie movies are awesome. I was pleasantly surprised by how good American Reunion was and, uh, I hope they let it, you know, I'm sure they will let it go now, but, um, you think so? Yeah, I don't, I don't know man. I don't know. I don't, I don't know if I trust them. Scene with his neighbor in the new movie, what the naked girl?

Um, so it's cool to see those characters. I like those characters. I like his characters a lot too. I bet we get an Oz spin-off soon. An Oz spin-off? An Oz spin-off. I'm glad that he got, they got him back. He thought he was hot **** for a minute. Yeah, I know. Come on, Chris, which one is he? Chris Klein? I want to say Pine, but it's not. Chris Klein, yeah, thought he was hot ****. He wasn't going to be an American Wedding. You remember when he was, he was dating Katie Holmes too for a while, was he ? Yeah, he was. Yeah, why? And that was kind of insulting to people who wouldn't come back for American Wedding. Come on, what are you doing? Yeah, this movie franchise made you, make time for it.

I'm trying to think of another example of uh scheduling problems, that's what they said, that there was, they were legitimate scheduling problems with him in the original movie, but I, I don't know if I really believe that or not. I think some people think that they're too big, they get big, they try to do something else. What do you think? Bringing it back to Katie Holmes then, she didn't come back for the second Batman movie, remember that? I thought that was intentional though, wasn't it? Didn't it like her performance or something? Oh, was it? I'm getting a nod. Nick, you can talk, people know you're over there. Oh yeah, I think the way I heard it was he just, he wanted a cast all right. Good, then I'm glad I'll leave it at that. He was probably nervous because Katie Holmes was getting all Scientologist out and he didn't want to have that on the Batman set.",

Yeah, distracting from to level three Scientology officer or whatever they, they, they call. I don't think she has that power. No, yeah, especially not now, right? She's out of it now, is she? I think so. I thought you could never get out. No, she got divorced because of that. Oh , okay, because she wanted to raise her kid in a normal world. L Ron Hubbard, isn't that the guy's name? Yeah, yeah. All right, well you're treading in, people have suggested Scientology. This the American Pie topic from Jay and Green was a great one. Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen.
