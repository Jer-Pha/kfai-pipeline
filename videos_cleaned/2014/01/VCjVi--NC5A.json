            "text": "[ Music] what's up everybody Welcome to a Gregway. Today's Greg way topic comes from Brand Range, of course, Rambling with Range, you know him from Gamec podcast, Beyond. He's a fan of the Greg Miller products, the whole line of Greg Miller products as you know. He asked me what's it like being an only child and there's no easy answer to that, right? Like it's it's all I've ever known . I don't know, you talk to people with siblings and sometimes they love it, sometimes they hate it. Being an only child you just you know what you know, right? Like it was weird growing up like I you know I definitely I was spoiled first off, like you know what I mean? Like you've heard my dumb stories about WWF Royal Rumble and all these other things, like my parents and aunt and uncle like they took care of me incredibly well, entire family you know , spoiled me not rotten CU I'm still a good kid but anything I ever I never really wanted for anything, right? Because there was nobody else to worry about, screw screw everybody else.",

Because there was nobody else to worry about, screw screw everybody else. I'm the I'm I Not only was I the only child, right in the family tree, right? Like on my mom's side, her sister, aunt and uncle, they had no kids and then over my dad's side there were other children's cousins you call them in a family tree but they were older than me so I was kind of like everybody's last hurrah anyway, nobody really cared much about it. So being only child was you know, I didn't want for anything and then there were you know, I I probably played with action figures for too long. I remember I remember the first girlfriend I ever had in high school, I brought her over and I was like showing her my room and touring and then I was like oh and here's where I keep my toys and here's where I keep my action figures . She like what? I was like oh do do normal High School freshman not have a",

I was like oh do do normal High School freshman not have a drawer full full of Superman and Batman action figures where they? She's like no. I'm like huh, I do. That's how I live. Um but yeah it was all right. I mean there you know there was I I liked being only child. I liked having nice things and everything else and the kids I always saw who had siblings they always had like the extreme it seemed, right? Like there's one kid I went to school with, Eric, he had like five other brothers, right? And so their house was just a train wreck all the time. It just kids screaming, there was always another baby like he you know, there was like he never felt like he was getting enough time or whatever it felt like or stuff like that. I don't know, of course this is in the moment, God only knows how it feels now. I'm sure they're all Lumberjacks or professional football team but",

I'm sure they're all Lumberjacks or professional football team but there's pluses and minuses to each I imagine, right? Like on my side there's definitely times where you're like it would be cool to have a little brother or an older brother or somebody to teach you stuff, not to teach you how to dress, right? God knows I didn't know what I was doing when I stopped wearing school uniforms. Um but overall you you know you just learn like anything else. You know I think it was more lonely maybe at times but it wasn't terrible. I I definitely made a lot of dumb shows in the basement on the video camera like this where I would talk to him and that seems to have paid off pretty well for me so unless that other family of six is a professional football team I think I pained out all right being an only child's kind of cool. So there you have it ladies and gentlemen",
