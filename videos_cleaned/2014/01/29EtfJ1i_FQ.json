I'm Greg and this is my roommate, Colin. Now sometimes Colin says crazy stuff, so every Tuesday and Thursday I reach into my random topic pile, pull one out, toss it at him, and we talk it out for your amusement. If you like that, like the video, share it with your friends, subscribe to us on YouTube. Colin, are you ready? Yes. Today's topic of conversation is how to pick up girls. This is from Mirthrandir804, how to pick up girls. How to pick up girls. I think first and foremost, it's cliche to say it's all about confidence. You got to fake it till you make it. Greg Miller never really confident, but if he has to talk to somebody and act like he's talking to somebody and he knows what he's doing, he'll do it. Yeah, this is what you got to do. You got to go, you got to be brave. Yeah, you got confidence is totally brave. Somebody said what was it?",

Yeah, you got confidence is totally brave. Somebody said what was it like? I'm going to screw this quote up, but basically like going be, you know, going out and doing something that you know you can do and having no qualms about it, that's not brave. Like being brave is being scared of doing what you're doing. So there you go. That's what you got to do. Go talk to them. It's just have a conversation with women. Yeah, I think I think this goes for picking up men too. I think you know, there's a few things that are important. Uh, I think you know, you have to, the confidence thing is really important. I also think the respect thing is really important too. Sure. You know, women , there's so many guys out there that just disrespect women and I don't think that that's cool as a guy and I don't think women like that. I think that there are some women that like that and I don't think you",

I think that there are some women that like that and I don't think you want to be with a woman like that. Um, um, and you know, the the one thing I always realize is I always feel like I've always, you know, I was always like going after girls like that I thought were out of my league and it worked over and over again. And like what I what I understand about that is that confidence really is at the core of that that you have to, you know, portray a certain confidence in yourself, a certain humor about yourself, sort of almost self-deprecating in a way. Um, that's why we're good at it. Yeah. And like, you know, this happened, you know, I remember like my first, I I dated girls in high school, but the girl I dated um for a couple years in high school, I met, she was a figure skater and I was a hockey player and we met at the arena or what, isn't there a movie about this? Maybe I don't",

Maybe I don't know. No, Cutting Edge. Cutting Edge, that's what I'm thinking of there. So there's a movie about and I remember I remember you know, you know, talking to her the first time and just making her laugh and like putting that seed in her head where she was like she she REM would remember me because I was a funny guy. I had my through some of the jokes. I don't I don't ice sure is cold, ain't it? It's like I just have my I had my goalie like, you know, goalies, you know, carry their, you know, they stick in their bag, but they also carry their leg pads over their shoulder too, because they can't fit them in. So you look like a badass, you look like an athletic badass. Yeah, I'm like hulking around and and we were just talking, she gave me, I gave her, yeah, she, I'll just give you my number. I had to go play or whatever and she",

I had to go play or whatever and she called me a few days later and it was like I didn't, you know, that was tell me the ice story again. That would it just builds confidence, right? And like that happens over and over again. I mean, even, you know, my girlfriend right now who I'm going to be with, I think for the rest of my life, um, you know, that was like, uh, I had to be confident in getting a girl like she's smarter than I am, she's better looking than I am, she's like all these things you have to show them the good side of you, the confident side of you that is that has nothing to do with your sexuality, that has to do more with like who you are as a person because that's really what's important to me. Yeah. Um, we're all wrapped up in like looks and sex and all those kinds of things and that's important, but what's really important is",

Um, we're all wrapped up in like looks and sex and all those kinds of things and that's important, but what's really important is like portraying like the person you are and the person you want to be with because you know, the sex lasts what, 15, 20 minutes for you, last probably two minutes. I was I was going to say 15, 20 seconds. What are you talking about? I got DC Universe to play, but you have you have all this time where you have to be with this person and what's really important is like the compatibility issue and stuff like that. So I think that putting your heart on your sleeve and being honest about who you are and and and stuff like that like is very endearing to women. Um, and like a lot of people have this notion that like beautiful women, you know, like beautiful buff guys, well this is not true. No, we both have, we both have, we both have beautiful girlfriends and like, um, who have no business being with us. No. And like I",

No. And like I think that we're you know, you know, punching above our weight or whatever and uh, but I think that's common. Like people always say those kinds of things like look at this guy that this girl's with. Well, like that guy might be **** awesome. You know, you're judging him based on his looks, not who he is, what his character is and stuff like that. And so I think you put that kind of stuff out in the Forefront, it overrides like all of the aesthetic issues you might have. You know, I think that that's what's most important. So be confident. I mean, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. If you go off and talk to somebody and doesn't go well, big **** deal, who cares? That person doesn't matter, but you know what I mean? Like you went up and tried to talk to somebody you thought looked cool and they weren't",

Like you went up and tried to talk to somebody you thought looked cool and they weren't cool and so now they're going to never think of you again. Why would you get hung up and think about them and dwell on it? You know what I mean? Like go ahead and take those shots and yeah, I mean you're going to get, you know, everyone's been rejected and you're going to get rejected and that's going to hurt and stuff, but it's not I almost I know it's funny, but I don't think it's even really personal. It's like no person might have a girlfriend or a boyfriend, that person might have, you know, might not be interested, the person might not be compatible with you, you might the things you think work aren't working on this particular person doesn't mean you shouldn't try again.

Yeah. Um, but the chase starts with that spark and that spark has to like be meaningful and so that be yourself and be confident, be respectful and uh, and I think it all goes from there. I think I think it's easy in in a sense when you think when I think about my own history, right, with like women, I think it's like, well, I've had more successes than failures. Yeah, you just have to you have to just try, choose your shots and then you you learn more about yourself and you learn more about the women you date and then you find the one like we've found our girlfriends or whatever that we really",

That's beautiful. Yeah, you're a beautiful man. Thank you. I like you a lot. Thanks. Thank you. I like you a lot.
