Yes, I have hear your your millions of tweets, your cries, they have been heard. It is time to finally see what these up of course, a beautiful package, and let's not lie, this is the most mind-blowing announcement you could imagine, right? An Oreo cookie with cookie dough in between. This is how you know we're in the end times. It's never going to get better than this. But also I like that they put here made with chocolatey chips.

Oreo is always very good about not putting themselves in a corner, right? They always say flavored cream, they spell cream different, it's not real cream, and then chocolatey chips, is that a chocolate chip? Who knows? We'll find out. All right, so every Oreo begins with the patented first look. I mean, I want to love these, let's not lie. Get out of here cup, but you notice already we have a few busted, not bad, but then this big old missing space here, the smash cookie up there, what happened there? Why you doing this? But let me tell you the bouquet, it's got me. I'm pretty excited about these cookies, like I've been saying all right, so first look, it's good. You know, I mean, as far as what we've seen here on the Oration, we've been doing this show a long time, I'm saying it's one of the better better looking first looks, but let's get into of course taste.",

That's what it all comes down to. That's the one we've been waiting for. It's going to require some research. I mean, the first thing that hits me right is just that it's sweet. It's very sweet. I'm not it's not it doesn't taste like cookie dough, let's not lie. It's you know, everyone knows cookies are great, sure, but cookie dough is where it's at. You know , your mom puts raw eggs in it, she's like it will kill you and you're like I don't care, I will eat this by the handful and that's how you lose your little sister. But this one I want to let it breathe. It's really sweet. I'm I'm losing the cookie dness of it. I real it's not speaking to me saying cookie dough cuz obviously again we want it to be the two parts of the Oreo and your mom's cookie dough in the middle she's a sweet one I can I definitely",

I real it's not speaking to me saying cookie dough cuz obviously again we want it to be the two parts of the Oreo and your mom's cookie dough in the middle she's a sweet one. I can I definitely taste the chocy chips, whatever the hell that means, but it doesn't taste like cookie dunk. I'm going do I'm going back in for more. I'm crazy tonight. I like it. I would eat this cookie in a recreational fashion, not just in my profession, but again, not very cookie doughy. Now I'm just getting some of the cream. Yeah, I like it , but I don't know. Let's see how it pairs with milk. Of course, is a big part of cookie dough Oreos test is how's it going to fair with a little bit of milk. Get the nice Zoom going here. All right, we're do the meloy moment one, two, three. It pairs well. It pairs well like a fine steak with a glass of wine if I ate steak and wine a lot. I'm getting more hints there's there's a definitely a a new flavor texture smell coming out of this cookie. Now again, I don't think it tastes like",

Now again, I don't think it tastes like cookie dough, but the milk brings out a texture in it that was missing before. I'm again go back again. I like these cookies. I like these cookies a lot. They're really good period end of statement. All right, like I don't I can't give you the full rundown of it tasting like cookie dough which we're all expecting. I got to get over that I guess. We're going to twist test 1, 2, 3, perfect twist, no remnants. Let's see of course we do best two out of three here on the Oration. Boom, another perfect one. Um let's see if I can taste the cream a bit more like that. You go like that say yeah you fat little man what do you think of that? I like it. I I want to suggest double stuff in these guys even single stuffed that's how God intended them that's why the god in Nabisco made him that way but again there it is on",

I I want to suggest double stuff in these guys even single stuffed that's how God intended them that's why the god in Nabisco made him that way but again there it is on the back of the tongue it's almost like a Starbucks cappuccino kind of flavor right? That's not cookie dough but that's that kind of chocolatey taste you're getting not cookie dough but something you get out of a coffee flavor or a chocolate flavored coffee drink. Good job Greg it's a good analogy sure this guy agrees with me too. So final score for the cookie dough Oreo too sweet as a double stuffed great twists great taste taste as a single stuff I want to dock it for the double stuff but I'm not going to 9.0 an amazing cookie totally down with this limited edition go out to your store and get it I know it's brand new a lot of people don't have it just yet it is coming to everywhere as a limited time offer I like them quite a bit so that's the way the cookie crumbles for cookie dough Oreos",
