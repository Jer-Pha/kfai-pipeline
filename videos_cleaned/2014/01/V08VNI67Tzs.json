You know, the show every Wednesday and Friday I answer one of your questions, comments, or tweets and say just what's happening in the Greg spin of things, right? Today's question comes from Peter Peterson. Was that his real name? You be the judge. Peter Peterson says, Greg, if you had to choose, would you give away Colin or Portillo? It's a tough choice to ask me to make, Peter Peterson. Like, see, I have, I have follow-up, I have questions on all of this, right? So what does that mean, give away Colin or Portillo in quotes? Like, are they being sentenced to death or are they just like going about their lives? I just can't ever talk to them again. Like, what, what, what, what's the trade? So, like, if I give away Portillo, is someone there to take care of him or am I leaving him in the woods? If I give away Colin, does he have all his stuff and his job and his livelihood and everything else, right? Like, is if it's death, then clearly I'm picking Colin. He's a human being. I love Pell . We, we've talked",

I love Pell. We, we've talked about on the shows before here on GameOverGreggy.com in a zombie apocalypse, one of the first thing that happened, Pello has to die. Pello barks at every knock, every noise. He can't exist in that, you know what I mean? Like, I've already wrestled with the, you know, zombie apocalypse and now this up Sophie's Choice on how this would work. I there, there's different factors you weigh. So if it's death, I'm giving away Portillo. I'm letting Colin live so he can continue to be crotchety and watch hockey. Um , if, if it's them leading their lives, the rest of their lives as I, I guess I still have to do that, right? Like, like, yeah, I probably still have to do that, right? Cuz I love Colin. I'm going to get more years out of Colin than Portillo. So if I was just giving, like, if it's like you can never talk to one of",

So if I was just giving, like, if it's like you can never talk to one of these things again or touch them or pet them, I guess I got to pick Colin, but that one's a bit, I could see going either way, right? Cuz like, if I keep, stick with me, if I let, if I give away Colin that way, he just goes off and lives his life and he just has a happy life and moves back to New York eventually and yeah, if I give away Portillo, again, is he in the woods? Does he get to go to a nice family? That's, these are the concerns . These are my concerns. But there, yeah, I'd probably, I guess both times I, I, I have to keep calling. I guess, I guess, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of factors here, Peter Peterson. You're not, you're not weighing in on how Nick did I get him? Do you think that's the reasoning makes sense on what are some of the other, what is there another situation where I'd have to give one of them away",

No, I think I nailed it. Nick says I nailed it. Everybody, that's how Gregway works. You leave your question or topic for conversation . I have it with you because we're friends and I love you so goddamn much until next Gregway. Have a Gregway.",
