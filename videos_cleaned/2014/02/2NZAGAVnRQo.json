I'm Greg, and while you are outside tearing down your Christmas lights, come on, it's already March, what are you freaking doing? The fine people at Oreo were making endless variations to milk's favorite cookie . So every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like this video, subscribe to us here on YouTube, and please share it with your friends. It means a lot. Today we're reviewing, vroom, vroom, Double Stuffed NASCAR Oreos. Wow, honestly, I don't know why I'm doing it. I'll tell you that right now. I mean, well, in general, why do you do this? Why do you do a show about Oreos that no one really watches, no one pays you for? But that's beside the point. Right now, I don't know NASCAR. It's a Double Stuffed Oreo. How different can it be? But this falls into very similar packaging and very similar look, uh, as we are in the first look, uh, to that of the Halloween Ore os. You remember",

But this falls into very similar packaging and very similar look, uh, as we are in the first look, uh, to that of the Halloween Oreos. You remember those guys? You remember the Halloween ? They have the special designs and stuff. Same with the football, right? Anyways, we got NASCAR Double Stuffed Oreo. We got, uh, Tony Stewart here. I lived in Missouri, so I know a little bit about NASCAR, and I don't know that guy. If he was Carl Edwards, I would have known that. Shows you how much I'm able to know about. Anyways, uh, they got, they got the four, they got four fun designs. Same Great Taste. We remember this before, though. Was it really the same great taste? Let's jump in and see what we got here . The first look, patented first look, of course. Whoa, we got some, they look like they hit some crazy turns on the NASCAR track, right? I don't, I didn't have any NASCAR puns saved up. I'm sorry. Uh, not a terrible first look. They're looking good. Take a smell. My nose literally",

Take a smell. My nose literally touched one of those, so I'll try to get that out of there so no one takes that home. So we'll get that one out of there and that one too. They were both in the area of what was happening. But smell good. They smell like Double Stuffed Oreos, like we talked about. Let's see if we can figure out all the crazy designs they got here. First off, a 39. We never did, I never did this one with the Halloween Oreos. I felt bad about it after the fact. So we got 39 is one. We got a car. They're getting clever with, uh, what designs are putting on these Oreos. And now we got a 14. All right, I think, I think they might have been a bit liberal with we're making, we're having fun designs on our cookies. If they're just the same, they're just numbers. If we're just alternating numbers. Oh, here's a fun one. All right, Oreo with the",

Oh, here's a fun one. All right, Oreo with the checkered flag. I like that a lot. All right, so far, fun designs. They are not very fun designs. They are just 1419, no, 14, that's not right. 14, 39, a car. I like this one the best. They should have all just been this Oreo and checkered flag. That's what I, um, next part of anything, of course, for the oration, the taste. Let's see how this one tastes. Here's, we've talked about this before, the designs. We all know that a normal Oreo looks like this, right? And it's got the raised ridges, it's got this, it's got little designs here. But when you take an Oreo then and start taking out massive chunks of where the designs are, where the three-dimensional shape should be, I do think it throws off the wafer taste. It doesn't give you the same taste. This is a Double Stuffed Oreo. It should be, oh, it's a Double Stuffed Oreo. I love",

It should be, oh, it's a Double Stuffed Oreo. I love the, but something's different about them. They just feel less than, if that makes sense. They're not, you know, you don't eat it and immediately like, oh my God, yes, you know, in a NASCAR Oreo, I'm eating Tony Stewart's number, I guess. And then the other guy, does he say who he is on the back here? Hold on, I can win a trip. Oh, he signed it above it. Ryan Newman, Tony Stewart, and Ryan, Ryan Newman, sorry. Ryan Newman, you're not as famous as Tony Stewart or Carl Edwards. Carl Edwards should have been in the box. Um, again , let's see if milk brings it together. Oh, the picture is getting heavier. I'm getting weaker. I don't know what's happening. Ah, jeez Louise, one, two, three. Okay, the milk's making the cookie more pronounced. I'm a big fan of that.

You're getting more of that chocolatey taste before it was, you know, the the wafer part of the cookie. It was getting lost. It was just the cream, the influx of cream washing over your tongue, taking everything away, robbing you of that chocolatey taste. Milk helps bring it back out. That's a big thing. Let's see how the twist, got to do our best two out of three from the package closed again. So here we go. This is number one, that's a great twist. That's a good twist. Number two, a great twist. All right, so you don't have to worry about them. They twist great. They twist like Double Stuffs. Now you got your quadruple stuff. You got a great life. Um, final score, I'm going to give him a flat eight. I mean, they're still good, right? Especially for people who want the Double Stuffed cream. The cream is there.

If you, if you ever feel like you want more cream than you want cookie, that's where you want to go, because again, I think you're losing a lot with these crazy designs. There's so much, there's so much blank space there. You're losing the space, the, the, you know, it's getting thrown off what you're expecting out of an Oreo. Still, it's a Double Stuffed Oreo. You're not going to go wrong probably if you know what you're getting to. That's the way the cookie crumbles for NASCAR Double Stuff Oreos. But what do you think ? If you live in a Southern state, you probably live on these NASCAR cookies. And what other NASCAR Mountain Dew, NASCAR bread, NASCAR milk they sell. Give me a video response in the comments below. Review the cookie for yourself. Let me know if I was wrong. Then what else do I tell you to do here? It's the outro that I'm rough on. Like the video, subscribe to my channel, share it with your",
