            "text": "[ Music] [ Applause] [Music] What's up everybody? Welcome to Oreo Oration. I'm Greg Miller, and while you were out living your life and trolling Barnes & Noble for easy prey, uh, the fine people at Oreo were making endless variations of Milk's Favorite Cookie. So every Wednesday and Friday, I tear open a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to my YouTube channel. Today we're reviewing Mint Oreo Fudge Creams. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, once again, it is Fudge Creams week here on Oreo Oration. We've had some bad review scores. Some fudge cream, non-fudge cream cookies have come through, the chocolate, the peanut butter. We like them when they were fudge creams. We did not like them so much when they were just normal cookies. Now we're back to some fudge creams. Let's see how mint fares. The first part of the Oreo Oration test is the first look. That's not a good tear open on them, but look at that, all lined up nice and pretty. This is what",

That's not a good tear open on them, but look at that, all lined up nice and pretty. This is what you want when you open a fudge cream. You want them to look good. And again, like the other mint cookies, I can tell you right now, overwhelming that smell, that that mint coming right at you, punching the face, trying to clean your teeth while it adds to the calories. Let's move to the second part of the test, the taste. Okay, once again, um, a good, a good cookie. These fudge creams are surprising. We didn't like C akers all that much, you know, um, but the the fudge creams are actually working out pretty well for us. Um, I get the mint. I like the snap of the cookie itself. Again, I'm not tasting the chocolate for, I think I'm getting the fudge cream. That's where it's actually coming from, the fudge all over the cookie. It's good, it's tasty, it's minty. Uh, not nearly as good as coconut, not nearly as good as, uh,",

Uh, not nearly as good as coconut, not nearly as good as, uh, the other fudge cream I had, peanut butter, uh, but I like them. I do like them. Uh, so taste thumbs up on that one. Uh, we'll see how they pair with milk. Of course, we've learned before fudge creams don't pair well with milk, but not doubt anything one, two, three is going to change on that one. Let's see what we got here. Yep, the fudge locks it in. It's like a, you remember Independence Day when the alien ships came out and they had the green shield around them? That's what it is, green shield Oreos. Good cookie though. We go well with the milk cuz you know, you like milk, you like chocolate, but again, they're two separate things. You drink the milk, you eat the cookie. Don't try dunking them. Can't twist them. You know, that's a drawback of the fudge creams everybody. We can't blame the fudge creams for that. So we're",

We can't blame the fudge creams for that. So we're done already with the review. We've gone through the steps here. Um, I like the aftertaste of them a lot, but it's still not as good as peanut butter and everything else. I'm going to give these guys 85. 85. They're good. They're great. They're great. I'd say, all right, you like mint, this would be the way to go. I didn't, I remember the mint Oreos themselves. Let's see what I give those. We'll consult our Oreo review thing. Mint Oreo, you say, huh? 4.5 on the cool mint Oreo. So once again, the mint Oreo fudge cream, the fudge cream version of a cookie, way better than the regular version of the cookie. So that's how you do it. Some would say that's how the cookie crumbles here for the mint Oreo fudge creams. But what do you think ?

I'm sure there are. What I need you to do is tell me what they are in the comments below and where I can get them so I can continue to make my show. Then share this video with your friends cuz we got to grow the brand. Uh, here's the thing, I, I'll be back every Wednesday and Friday until I run out of cookies to review, but until then, keep on dunking. [Music] [Applause] [Music ]",
