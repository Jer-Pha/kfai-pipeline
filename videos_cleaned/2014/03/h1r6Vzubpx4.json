The news real quick, want to give a shout out to a dude that tweeted at me today saying that when we were talking about taxes last week, I, I failed to bring up the fact that tax rates are marginal, meaning that if you make $500,000 a year, only the $1 00,000 above $400,000 is tax at that high rate. I didn't make that clear. You know, I was wondering about that all week. Do I have to redact my letter I sent? No, to my congressman, Nancy Pelman. NY, Nancy Pelman, old. Let me ask you this question. Hit me with it. What's the best show that was on TGIF? Oh, I **** love your options. I love this guy. Here are your options: Perfect Strangers, Full House, Mr. Belvedere. Mr. Belvedere was one year, just the 10 of us, Dinosaurs, Baby Talk, which was terrible if you remember that, that got canceled. Let's see, Billy also got canceled, Camp Wilder, I remember that one, that got canceled, Hanging with Mr. Cooper, Sister Sister.",

Step by Step, yeah, Step by Step. Okay, just make sure. I think it's a hands down slam dunk, Boy Meets World. There's no discussion for sure. No discussion at all. Checkm. So we can talk about number two unless of course you haven't ever seen one single solitary World in which case how old are you? Perfect Strangers is an ABS 100% abolutely never one.

Family Matters, Step by Step, and Perfect Strangers. That was the, Step by Step was the, I feel like was the weakest linkoln in that four. It was for a little while then it got really good. Then the sisters got really, which one? That was Suzanne Summers, Suan Summers andrick, who were the sisters? Got to Google that. The sisters were, I can see them in my head. I see, I'll look them up. I'll get them you guys.
