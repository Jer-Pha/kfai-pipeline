Yeah, New York City, such a **** parody. Um, I was talking to Tim earlier about income taxes specifically, sure, and how I think income taxes are wrong. That that's it's inherently wrong. Now, there's a lot the income tax came in in 1913, the 16th Amendment. There's a lot of confusion even uh some talk that the con the amendment never really passed, that it you know, there's a lot of conspiracy theories about the amendment that it was illegal and all that kind of stuff. Nonetheless, it's law. It's been law for, you know, 101 years. The income tax came in during the Civil War briefly and in other times, but there we live this we live this. There was a United States with no income tax and it was fine. Awesome. It existed for a very long time. No income tax. It was a lot of excise taxes and stuff like that, but there was no income tax like tariffs, right? And I",

Everything sucks. He watch this is your bank account. I'm like what he hacked my Planet. So these are Google Tim Gettys, did you hack his Planet? So these are the marginal tax rates for individuals. Okay, okay. If you make no money to 8,000 like $9,000, you can pay 10% tax. Okay, okay. If you make up to $36,000, it's 15%. If you make up to 87,000, it's 25%. And then 183,000, 28%. 398,000, 33%. 400,000, 35%. And then 400 ,000 and over is 39.6%. Imagine making $400,000, not only that, but imagine making $400,000 and then 40%. That's upsetting.

Now, one of the big things that I think there's a huge misconception in this country, especially with the left about taxes, about income taxes, that the rich don't pay their fair share. And this is one of the things that really bothers me a lot because the rich pay a vast, vast, vast majority of the taxes in this country. Now, a lot of people would say, you know, well, they have most of the money and that's true, right? But there has to be a better way to extract funds out of people. There has to be a better way there is then robbing them and at and I think that income tax is **** straight robbery and is wrong. It's wrong. And I believe in something called and I want to see what you guys think of this.

I believe in something called the VAT, the value added tax or that's what they have in uh they have it in a lot of plac they have in UK, but in UK they also play pay income tax, right? So I would want the value added tax what which is what they also call the consumption tax if it replaces the income tax. And this is one of the things that Libertarians especially in the United States and repu a lot of Republicans want want to do. Herman Cain was one of those guys that proposed Godfather Pizza. Yeah, I love that guy until he you know, he deteriorated. I thought he had a really good idea because his whole thing was 999, right? Um, you know, 9% uh he wanted to do 9% income tax, flat 9% VAT, 9% capital gains. Yeah, and what a value added tax basically is is the tax on everything you buy. So instead of like if you make $40,000 a year, you just get $40,000 and then when you go buy things then you start getting tax. Now here's the Brill iance of the value added tax on in my",

Now here's the Brilliance of the value added tax on in my opinion is that it it doesn't tax or at least under most plans wouldn't tax uh Essentials. So food, clothing, fuel, you know, things like that because our gas our gas is highly taxed. Yeah, um, and then it would automatically tax the rich the most because the rich are the most conspicuous consumers of anyone. Sure, they're the ones that buy $100,000 cars. Well, if you had a 5% VAT, that's $5,000, right? Right away, you know, that they'll go on trips that cost $50, 000, you know, well, that's $2,500. Now, how does that differ from sales tax because there's sales tax, right? Exactly. So sales tax is on is it's similar. The value added tax is basically saying the value added tax is basically a replacement or designed to be a replacement for your normal system of taxation where you would draw most of your money which would be",

Therefore sales taxes at a state level and that would still exist in some states, not all. Not all states have sales tax. New Hampshire for instance, since I live there, there is no sales tax. Um, and then you would have state income tax if that's what the state's decided to do based on the 10th Amendment and then you'd have a value added tax instead of an income tax and this therefore gives you the choice about how much you are taxed or how little you're taxed, but you can't avoid it. You know what I mean? And that's what I think is most fair . So I wanted to see what you guys think about that. So with the the food you said clothes yeah food clothes Fuel and housing so no no taxes on houses so you can just buy as much food as you want, right? That seems weird. Why why is that weird? Well,",

Why why is that weird? Well, I don't know. I mean like what if the rich people just buy a lot of food? That's fine , but then but then you're you're punishing think about it this way if you're low income what do you spend most of your money on the essentials food housing Fuel and clothing. MH. So like this automatically protects the poor. It's conceivable that a poor person would never pay any taxes and that's fine. Yeah, I guess that makes sense. That's just one of those things where with if you take all those out of it feel like not that many things are even being taxed then. Well, yeah, a lot of things are being taxed like any any Goods, your computer, your microphone, your Superman thing, your ice cup, your your liquor, your phone, your T-shirt, dog toys, t-shirt, the T-shirt cloth, right?

But think about all the things the headphones, the board, the desk, the rug, you know, like like like I to me it just seems like an equitable way because you're you're you're basically buying in because what income tax is to me is just it is just **** wholesale robbery.

And so they they don't have to pay income tax because they get you know, the invoice and then someone sends them a check and then they at the end of the year they get $199 and then you have to pay the tax either quarterly or all in one lump sum. Um, so it's it's just it's fascinating to watch them because they'll go through months of I don't have any money I don't have any money oh my God I just got paid like for the last five months and it's just whatever the check is, right? Because when you get paid by a vendor or you get paid by a client they just give you the money they don't take taxes out of it because you're not you're a contract worker you're not an actual salary employee with them.
