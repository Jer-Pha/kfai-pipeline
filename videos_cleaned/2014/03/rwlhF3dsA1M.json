Uh, and there are some phenomenal trailers out right now, but I wanted to talk to you guys a little bit today about some of your favorite all-time movie trailers. Uh, I have two that come to mind. There's a lot of them out there. I know this is a hard topic, so you guys can feel free to think amongst yourselves while I I talk about mine. The first one that comes to mind was the trailer for 300. Yes. Actually, in fact, both of my trailers are going to be Zack Snyder trailers because the man he knows how to **** do it, man. He knows how to shoot a film. Zack Snyder to make an awesome trailer. Yeah. So, the first time I saw the 3 00 trailer, it had that badass song by Nine Inch Nails in the background, right? And it was you just saw that I want to **** you like an animal. No, it wasn't that one. But the first shot of the trailer",

But the first shot of the trailer you see is like that that the the emissary riding toward them and it's that slow-mo shot and then you hear the you know he's like you know tonight we die and he kicks the guy into the like this is Sparta. He kicks the guy into the thing and everyone's like oh Sparta we're going to go fight some people. It was an awesome trailer and it looked really really cool and the movie depending on where you come down on I thought it was an amazing film. I thought it was really fun. So to me that trailer was so good that I decided I didn't need to see the movie. I was like this this is it. Like I've never seen 300. I've never seen 300 because I've actually seen that trailer and I was like 300. **** this is perfect. The trailer was so well done. And when the arrows go up and like go up, they're like",

And when the arrows go up and like go up, they're like weapons happens. We'll fight in the dark. No. He goes he says, \"We'll fight in the shade.\" He goes, \"Our arrows will blot out the sun.\" And then it's Michael Fassbender, by the way, who says the line then we'll fight in the shade. And it's a hard ass line. Even in the movie, it's hard. He's like, \"We're just going to fight.\" Because these guys from start to finish know that they're going into death. It's they're just like whatever. We're just going to hold these guys for as long as we can. So that knowledge and that that Cavalier spirit just is it comes out in the film. It's awesome. Also, every single man in that movie is at the the height of his physical fitness, which is it's it's amazing thing to behold. Amazing.

Even Gerard Butler's never looked better than he has in that movie, but Fassbender looked like a badass in it because he's obvious he's a Fassbender. Do you think that if they cast Greg and I in the 300 as we look right now that that the the enemy would have been as menaced? I think they would have cast you guys on the side of the enemy because that's where kind of all the weird freaky guys were. So Greg could have been in like he could have taken that dominatrix outfit that he has back in his room that I saw in his closet earlier. He could have worn that. He could have been one of like the Persian soldiers. What else did you see in Greg's closet when you went in there? Um it wasn't a sea so much as a smell. It smelled like despair and chicken wing sauce and latex and like a lot you know that like really dusty latex smell. Oh my god. Yeah. And then it also like",

I kind of closed my eyes and just felt like I hear things every once in a while. Sounds like Castlevania with that whip going on. You went a different way. I enjoy that. I enjoy that. Um your second trailer. Second trailer is another another Zack Snyder special. And this is in no way, shape, or form reflective of the first one, but it is actually the trailer for Man of Steel. Now, when they released this trailer, they had two different versions of it. They had the one with Kyle's or I'm sorry, Joel's voice and the one with Mr. Kent's voice, Bob Kent. Yep. Thanks for watching conversation or horribly wrong comic gorgeous. Um, so it was Kevin Costner and",

And that's the one I watched second thankfully because the first one with Russell Crowe is so perfect that I I watch it to this day. I'll go back and watch that trailer because he has that amazing line where he goes, \"You will give the people some an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you. They will stumble and they will fall, but eventually they'll join you in the sun. Like eventually you'll you'll help them accomplish wonders.\" And it's so freaking cool. And that's the second you see him go like he does the thing and he's got the red cape as a kid and then you just see him the ground shakes and he just shoots up and that's it. And then it's that amazing Hans Zimmer score. God what a good and then you watch the movie",

Like those trailers are so good that you just don't need to watch the movies. But sometimes they're good or okay. No I mean everything that Russell Crowe said in Man of Steel was everything that Russell Crowe did in Man of Steel I thought was amazing. I thought was cool. I thought it was great. I don't want to I don't want to get you. The rage is building behind your eyes. I can tell. Not at all. No. To to go off on Zack Snyder, though. The Watchmen trailer. I like Watchmen the movie. I love the comic book as well. I thought the movie was good. Mhm.

That **** trailer is just everything that I wanted from a movie was in that trailer. Yeah, he makes phenomenal trailers. Trailer for uh Godzilla, the new Godzilla movie is really cool. You're right there with me, Nick. Yeah, that one. And actually, I will go on. I'm sorry. Continue. I was going to piggyback. My trailer is similar to this. Cloverfield. Oh, yeah. And now when I say this, I want the context of time. Damon and I were out to the movies. We work at IGN , a site that's all about movies and video games and nerdy stuff. And we went to the movies.

But what he's saying this first trailer didn't even have a title card. Oh, I remember. Yeah, because it was it was J.J. Abrams. It was like coming all the hell was like a date, right?

I mean, I know Robots honestly like it's just more Transformers movies, which is I'm fine with that. At this point, I've realized, see, I'm in a different camp than most people. Most people like, I don't like these reboots of these things that I loved. You're ruining it. To me, I'm like, at least we're getting something. I would rather see a shitty Transformers movie than no Transformers movie. Would I rather a good one? Yeah. But we're not going to get that. So, cuz it's dumb source material.

Again, the biggest problem with the Transformers movies is that it's not they're not about the Transformers. They're about the humans. And that is the biggest problem. If they ever were to and the costs prohibit that from ever actually happening , which is what the cartoons are for. Um but anyways, this trailer is awesome because it starts off with um an old semi-truck. No, they're all gone. I know there's new humans, Sam Wickwicki. But it's a semi-truck just being pulled by a little tow truck and it's the OG generation one Optimus Prime which I was always disappointed that they didn't they didn't actually have that to be I know it I mean that's one of those things where they wouldn't have done that because they're",

It does make sense. It's seeing this it looks super dated but I was like thank you for giving me that. Thank you so much. Yeah. And then the then Mark Wahlberg it's transform. I think I found you know what this is? I think I found a transformer. Yeah. Is that really what he says? It's like he goes to start the theater. He's like, \"It won't start.\" Then he like hooks it up to like a big battery and it goes transformer. I think it's a transformer. And then the nutshot is like Optimus Prime **** barrel rolling out of humans killing everyone. It's cool. This is still set in the same universe, right? This is the Optimus same universe.

I think I saw a Twitter joke that I laughed at even though I hadn't seen this trailer that was uh something like Earth, we don't need Transformers. Explosion, we need the Transformers. Colin, what do you got for me? Any trailers stick out to you? You hate movies? There. What about books? Have you ever read a good book about a trailer? Oh, for sure. There's a whole book about trailers. There was a seminal movie in my for my in my life. Mhm. came out uh somewhat recently.

That movie was okay, but it was just an amazing shot of the dude walking out of his house and the and the Korean fighter jet just smashing into the house next to him because it got shot down and just that huge explosion. I always loved what's so special about the original Red Dawn is that it's like all this stuff that you think happens overseas happens in your own backyard. That's what that was cool. But I'm going to take it away from movies and bring it to games real quick for a trailer because the best trailer of all time is Gears of War.

The Dead Island trailer was good, but there's not nothing touched that Gears of War trailer. That Gears of War trailer was a complete paradigm shift for gaming. Like the way like games are presented and the way games are recognized. I mean, I was playing in movie theaters and stuff like that. Like that's the first time I saw it.
