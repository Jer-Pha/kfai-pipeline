You got a Spider-Man, so Spider-Man, I'm going to spring all my things over here for you to we to that **** movie. See Thomas H's greatest work. Mr. Champagne, uh, invited me to do his podcast and we've been gone back and forth because I think I messed up the audio record on my on my side. So he's got like hours and hours and hours of just dead silence. No, it's like some for some reason the tempo's going up and down, up and down. So he's got to like fix that as he goes. Oh, wow, what a nightmare. It's a nightmare. It's almost not worth it, almost. But now you got to shout out another game great show. What up, Champagne? Uh, my topic tonight, it'd be helpful to shout off that their name of the podcast you're going to be on. It's the Jimmy and Eden, Jimmy and Eden podcast. There you go. It's really good. It's on NBC. Bing it. It's not on NBC. Google it.",

It's not on NBC. Google it. Um, **** go. So I I wonder this sometimes because when I was a kid, I really, really, really, someone asked me a topic, what do you want to be when you were a kid? We'll get into that later. My answer is Batman. I wanted to be Batman. That was the first thing I could remember thinking about being. As I get older though, it strikes me that it might be a little weird and or terrifying if Batman were real. Absolutely. That would not be cool. So that's what I want to talk about. What if Batman were real? What if there was a man who was like 6'4 and I'm I'm assuming we're living in a universe where there's no no other, so it's real life right now and all of a sudden there's a Batman fighting crime. So my question is, is there a comic book Batman in this universe? Are there comic books in this universe? It's this",

Are there comic books in this universe? It's this universe. So right now we already have all these Batman comics books. Somebody says, I'm Batman. Okay, okay, I'm with you. I'm with you. Wait, wait, I want to verify this. Obviously there are comic books in the universe. That's that's a weird question because because there are comic books. So of their kind. Certainly in The Walking Dead Universe no one's ever heard of the zombie. They don't have that concept. That's why no one ever calls Walker zombies. That makes that show even worse. It's it's a property long outside of just the show. But okay, so but Batman doesn't exist in comic form. I haven't thought this far but we can say yes, Batman doesn't exist in comic. Okay, this is right now some dude starts doing this. What's our reaction? So you're changing it so you're it's we know that there's a Batman some guy",

No, I was thinking more along terms of like comic book like superheroes don't exist and we're living in a shitty city like well you know like we're living in San Francisco and all of a sudden what doing he's busting **** mun drivers sleeping on the job. We just see we start hearing about a guy who's running around dressed as a bat. Yeah, and he's cleaning up the city of the Tenderloin. Okay, it's terrifying though, right? Like I think as as a normal human being I like I'm not I'm not going to go in the Tenderloin anymore cuz there's a dude who like you're just walking right and you're smoking a cigarette and then all of a sudden like out of nowhere some dude comes from the sky and just",

There was a Hey Arnold episode about this. Was there with Monkey Man and it didn't end well for Monkey Man. So at any point do we think this you don't acknowledge any I'm trying not I'm trying to stay on topic. Sure, sure, sure. At any point do we acknowledge that this might be a cool thing or is it just terrifying? I think it I mean I think it's the same thing that happens in every Batman film, right? Where it would be we wouldn't believe people for the longest time then it would be like you're wor again you're like being a coward about it. Why would you be walk why would he jump on somebody smoking a cigarette in the tendone? He's looking for bad guys.

It's not like Batman's like **** capturing normal people out you know on a date or something. But also but then it's going to be there's going to be the big moment of there's a fire there's that giant Mission Bay Fire, right? And he's going to jump out like in his cape and have like a kid under his arm what it's good be a good moment and then he's all he's just back kid from but then he just lands on the ground in broad daylight every like what do we do now? So I think the thing there in real life there has been a bunch of these quote unquote superheroes they're like dudes that dress up and try to do good but it's this is different like the way you phrase this to me it makes me think this guy's legit Batman, Christian Bale Batman.

It is cool. No, it's really cool but it's also terrifying. Like I think that is the most terrifying thing ever is that this this guy's fighting crime you know in the comic world it's like oh yeah he's a good guy we're rooting for him but in real life it's like that's not up to you to decide if it's good or bad like that's not your position Mr. Batman like we have a law system and things like that work let's not take into to account that it if if there were a bunch of people running around fighting crime I like the quotes none of that would actually hold up in court at no point vigilante vigilante ISM yeah it be vigilant isn't yeah there's no how how you",

I want to say no and I want to say that they if not then then we don't need to guy like Batman. They come what is the point? No, see this is this is always the's heel or whatever the you know the endless struggle here is that Batman's actions create these super villains. Yep. So like right now like we just had that uh what citizen Alderman what or what was he senator who got busted lein right for all the gun running and stuff that's a Batman takedown but in instead of like it all coming to light slowly like the DA would have gotten the files from Batman he would have gone to do it and somebody would have gotten kicked into a tub of acid and become you're",
