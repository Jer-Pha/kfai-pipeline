Like sometimes I just, I'll go on these weird kicks where all I do is eat protein and like think I'm losing weight, but in reality I'm probably not. You are, you look good. Sometimes I break and when I break, I break hard and I go directly to one place. There's one fast food establishment that I that I love more than anything in this planet and that is Taco Bell, the T-Bell. Yep. And what I like about Taco Bell is that they only have really like three ingredients, but the menu is vast. Yeah, I mean they just can make billions of different menu items with those combinations of those three elements. So I, I this is the question I have for you guys today, if you could only live on one fast food and I live on it, like you wouldn't gain weight, you wouldn't die, you wouldn't get anything, but you can only have one fast food for the rest of your life, what would it be?

And I'm not talking a type of food, I'm talking one establishment. All right, so now you got to immediately start breaking it down for me in the census. Does Buffalo Wild Wings count as fast food? It's a sit down restaurant, no drive-thru. I say no. No. Okay. Does In-N-Out count as fast food? In-N-Out count as fast. Does Portillo's count as fast food? You've been to Portillo's. Nick does not count. You've been to, you've both been to P, not fast food. It's good food quickly. I would say, but there's a drive-thru. Do they serve you? I think if there's a drive through you, you go in, you if you're going to go inside, Colin, you walk over to the counter, you place your order, you walk down to the other end of the assembly line, you have a number, they call your number, you go and get your food in a sack.

That's fast food. That's that's definitely fast food. It's a, it's it's local, you know, it's family owned chain. How is that any different than In-N-Out? You know, like in that it's better quality food. I mean, I'm not arguing that. There's something to be said about cost, just about the the price range of how much a a meal is and like the combo variety. I feel like Portillo's is of a higher standard. I agree with that 100%. And I think that that makes it a little less fast, but In-N-Out is of a higher standard too. Should we call P count? Yeah, it's cheap, but it's good. It's good quality food. So price, price seems arbitrary. It seems to be, I think price has a lot to do with it. I don't know. Let's let's Greg's going to call Portillo's right now and see if they they count themselves amongst the fast food chains. Okay, but but yeah, you know,",

Okay, but but yeah, you know, this is a it's a big debate on what counts as fast food and what doesn't cuz obviously you have the classic burger places, those are all fast food. Yeah, I mean you got McDonald's, you got Hardee's if you're bad, Carl's Jr. here, uh Sonic Burger, Sonic Skin. We're calling the Bloomingdale, Illinois Bloomingdale. This is wonder you home, I help you. Hey Linda, my name is Greg Miller from the GameOverGreggy Show. I was wondering, does Portillo's count as fast food? Yes, thank you very much. No problem.

There's not there's not a, you're talking about like the range of a Taco Bell menu. Got chocolate shakes. It's got tamales. Yeah, it's a lot of stuff going on there.

That's why I mean I grew up in P pill's home, you know what I mean? That's one thing I always talk about, right? Is like when I left Chicago, you know, my parents split up and they move to different places. So like, you know, there's no childhood home anymore.

She's say don't **** talk to me like all right Grandma. Let me ask you this cuz Mustard's the devil's condiment first of all. MH um but let me so mustard belongs on nothing. Mustard doesn't is doesn't belong in this world, right? So if I went to Portillo's, I like to put ketchup on everything because I'm from New York and what we do there. Yeah, you put the mayonnaise on there too. Uh I was going to say like I like to put I like my hot dos with mayonnaise and ketchup now would that be acceptable there? Am I able to do that? No, they give options. Here's the thing about Portillo's is that they don't judge you for anything.",
