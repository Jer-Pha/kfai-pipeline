What is the best movie soundtrack? Quite the leading right there. When you think back to all the movies you've seen, what is the one soundtrack that got stuck in your head so much that all your friends wanted to kill you? See, this is , this is so hard because there's so many good scores, but there's also so many good licensed soundtracks, and these are two very different things. Varsity Blues, we're talking about all of them. Varsity Blues, whatever, whatever you get excited about. And like, I, and I said the same thing cuz there are, you're right, there's a lot of really good soundtracks like uh that you can queue up and listen to and just a compilation of other people's songs, but then there's soundtracks like anything Han Zimmer does that you just like, I'm going to play that for the 74th time on Spotify and no one can stop me. John Williams, both",

John Williams, both of those, the themes that John Williams makes, basically anything that they make. Like Greg, I'll give you one. I already said mine and I have it here. That was it. Varsity Blues. It had the song Varsity Blue performed by Caroline Spine, never did anything that I know of, but then Nice Guys Finish Last by Green Day, My Hero Foo Fighters, Run Collective Soul, Are You Ready for The Fallout by Fastball, Horror Show Third Eye Blind. These are big names. Thunderstruck ACDC, Nitro, The Offspring. There's a bunch of other stuff in here. I'm not bugging any with those are the great ones. That's a great soundtrack. Am I wrong? That's a really good soundtrack. Thank you. I thought you, I thought two for sure, the two that you were going to pick, Ghostbusters one and two. No Ghostbusters 2, no one picks Ghostbusters 2 in any",

No Ghostbusters 2, no one picks Ghostbusters 2 in any category ever except too hot to handle, too cold to hold, they call the Ghostbusters cuz they in control. Was it Hammer who did that one? That was uh Bobby Brown. Well, I guess we're going to have to take control, got got take uh I thought you were going to go that or I thought you might go John Williams Superman. That was a great score as well. That was a great yeah score. That's probably in my book, not my favorite, but the most iconic score ever ever made. I think Star Wars. Do you think Star Wars is Star Wars though? That's yours. Superman's close. No, I'm saying Star Wars is the most iconic. I think Superman is still more iconic. No man, no son, because Star Wars, Star Wars has that that one opening like you know, you know what I'm interested in though, we've talked about this with episode seven, now that Fox",

Like they can't Mickey Mickey Mouse is going to come over. No, no, now we're getting the badass like **** Disney Castle, badass Castle, which by the way has gotten that's you're beat red right now. That's my cuz he stole your money. You're a **** adult who cares about Mickey Mouse man? You're just insan. I know if we would call calling Tim an adult is a stret it's a stretch. He wants to live in the Pokemon world for Christ's sake. I'm just saying that that song doesn't have the same punch. Does Disneyland count as a fantasy world, a universe? Disney's Disneyland, that's not a universe, that does not count . No, but you you could live in a universe where you could legitimately go out with the girlfriend Frozen or you live",

I was that okay, let's continue. She's just a **** magician too. Frozen's a great soundtrack too. Frozen's amazing. Uh actually a lot of Disney, a lot of Disney soundtracks are amazing. Oh yeah, just cuz they are musicals. In fact, I still got to go super this is why I think the Superman soundtrack is better just a a sco better than Star Wars than Star Wars just because of the way it starts. You get that like it's the buildup yeah and then it's like what what was that skun you up Cheetos all skun skun and it just goes into and you hear it and it it just instantly this is the power of John Williams. It actually makes you like the sounds of it make you feel like you are flying. Yeah, that is why that movie and that soundtrack is so",

Yeah, that is why that movie and that soundtrack is so amazing. Star Wars L really really close my but as is Raiders of the Lost Ark . That is another one. Anything John Williams did in the 80s was yeah it's ridiculous. God Star Wars though like that theme is so I would say is the most iconic but Star Wars in general like there's so many scores in that that are just like top tier duel the fates is just that is the epic fight song. Well it's hard to Darth Maul one. Yeah John Williams got like six chances of getting those things right and he knocked it out of the park every single time right? The Imperial March yeah the most evil song yeah so good like that is the villain song and just that my favorite is the ending song the go for it Nick which is [Music] it yeah that's that's man like that's every single one of it's like oh he's hanging off the thing and his",
