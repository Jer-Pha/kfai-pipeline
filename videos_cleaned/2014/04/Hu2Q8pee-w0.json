You know, I understand a little bit of it. I like reading more about it, about the theories. I like chemistry, especially in physics. I think those are very interesting. But I also like astronomy a lot and I've always been really fascinated by specifically the planets in our solar system. And as you grow up, you're kind of fascinated by them, right? You're kind of fascinated by space and astronauts and all this kind of stuff. Space travel , obviously, we're all kind of nerdy. We like sci-fi a little bit to varying degrees. And so I have a very simple question for you is like, what's your favorite planet? Uranus's gotta get it out there. Goats Uranus. Mm-hmm. Earth. We're on it. Earth. It's my favorite planet. It supports life. We're on it. It's got nice colors. Yeah, I gotta give a shout out to Earth too. Yeah, it's a good place. It's, it's the most aesthetically",

What's on Mars ? We don't know, right? We just landed that face. We got a rover. Yeah, we got some rovers on there. We got some satellites. We're sending the uh, suicide mission to Mars, which , you know, we talked about. But we're not sending it. Well, yeah, a private company is doing it. Yeah, are they actually doing that? Yeah, I don't know that. Yeah, Mars, what is it called? Mars One or something like that. I would say Pluto, but not anymore. Now I know you hear about Pluto. Great episode of Nova about Pluto and how it was removed from being a planet. What really is annoying, Saturn with its highfalutin'shit. Oh, I got a ring around me. Everybody look at me. Do",

Yeah, you know, Saturn's are so prominent. Jupiter has rings, Uranus has rings, and Neptune has rings. Jupiter is the biggest of all the planets , right? Yes, by far. Yes, you can fit all the other planets in Jupiter. Yeah, big shout out to Jupiter for that. Big shout out to Jupiter. Jupiter is a, might be a failed star. It might have been a binary system. I also have the coolest name, Jupiter. Yeah, God of War sounds badass. God of War is Ares. No, there's Roman and Roman god. Yeah. Um, yeah, Jupiter. There's only one God of War. Was that Mars?

I don't know. Neptune's a good planet. You see, like, underrated though. Who the fuck, dude, who cares about Neptune? I remember in high school, I couldn't remember, I named all of them, couldn't remember Neptune. Started asking all my friends, I'm like, name all the planets. And like five people named all of them but Neptune. They're like, oh, fuck, I don't know what that last one is. And there you go. You know, that's why my very mother just baked me.

I got to give a shout out to like, I liked all the planets for different reasons. Sorry. Jupiter was the uh, the Zeus. Oh, so the God of the Gods. The God of the Gods. Yeah. Um, that makes sense. Mercury's cool because, you know, it's right. It's tiny planet, heavily cratered. Um, very dense. Uh, very close to the sun. Barely see it, right? I like that. Venus is interesting because Venus has a runaway, um, a runaway, uh, what do they call it? Um, by degree, a greenhouse gas. They have like a runaway, a lot of problems there too though.

Mars is cool because Mars is, is a parallel to us and we, we have like a strange fascination with that planet. I understand that. We'll go home. We could live there. Closest to. We haven't gotten to it. Uh, right. No men haven't stepped down. That's why, that's why we're super stoked. Soon, soon. Um, then we have the Asteroid Belt, which was a planet, not anymore. How long does it take to get to Mars? When was it a planet? Nine months. Uh, it was a planet before destroyed. What, what? Yeah, like the asteroid, the asteroids aren't just there for special reasons. It's the same reason why there are rings around them, around the planets, because those are destroyed moons.

So now the planets are no longer made of rock and mineral. Now they're made of gas. And Jupiter is huge. It's huge. Very stately planet with a shit ton of moons, like 60 moons , you know? And that, that to me is like awesome on its own. Like, come on, that's baller. And uh, and and it's got its own ring. We didn't know that until we went there with, I think, Voyager. Um, so do we need to like redesign what we look at? Like all the kids at the science fairs right now are really fucked up and not putting rings on Jupiter? No, because I don't think like that's not, it's the, the Red Spot is its prominent feature. You know, you want to focus on the Red Spot. Of course, you might be the Death Star.",

Io, which is the, the ice planet or the ice moon that they think might have a full ocean underneath it that could support life , which is pretty cool. Are we ever gonna find life on any of these planets in our system? Probably not. Maybe Mars, maybe Titan, maybe Io. I mean, those are, those are the targets. But there's certainly life in others.

The guy who wrote, the guy who wrote the book Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus. Fuck that guy. That was a big book in the 90 s. Looking at some uh, images here. I'm looking at the uh, the scale of how big Jupiter is compared to everything else. It's big. It's huge. It's not small. That's why they're saying like, so when a, when a star turns on, it gets, it gets big enough and hot enough. And some people think that Jupiter was a failed star, like a brown dwarf, right? Like a star that just didn't turn on. Because if you think about Tatooine, a good example is Tatooine, right? Tatooine's in a binary system, two stars, right? And we might have a great example .

What's interesting about Uranus was that it was a, there was an ancient collision with another huge body that sent its axis on the side. I like, Tim can't even. It's Uranus. But is, do you think if we had to right now, lives depends on it, the four people at this table would know more about the planets in our real solar system or in Star Wars? I would know more about the real solar system. I 1000 would know more about Star Wars. You know, and about individual planets. You can't name any of the other, if you could name another, can you name another, another, another planet in Tatooine's system? Because I can.

Padm\u00e9 is a woman. But, but , but, yeah, so I feel like there's a lot of diversity in the, you know, I, it's hard for me to pick a planet. I really like Uranus's story, you know, a lot , because there's this ancient collision with it. Like Uranus, you know, if you look at the planets that rings, right? You're killing me. Stop saying it. Uranus. The rings go around like normal, right ? Yeah, but like Uranus's rings go around the other way, like, you know, vertically. And it's because, and its axis is actually vertical. So it's actually sticking out. It's because it was knocked like really hard by another object. It's cool that we have like, so something big went into the Uranus.",

Like the Asteroid Belt being a planet. We know it was, but we've never seen it. Like it's just cool that like the, the solar system was like five billion years old . So, and the universe is 13 billion years old. So there's like all this cool, that's not fact, it is theory, 13.7 theory. But it, there's all this cool evidence about that cosmic shit that happened. That's what I'm really fascinated by. It, it's the same thing with like, you know, they think that there was a rogue planet that ran into the Earth back in the day that gave us the moon, shit. And we realized that because the moon is made of the same stuff that the Earth is. And we only knew that when we sent the Apollo astronauts there. And",

And so what they think is, I think they call it Theia, I think, is the, the planet that knocked into the Earth, probably disintegrated or kept going out of the system. And then like all the dust like went around into a ring and then became the moon. That's why the moon is getting further away by two inches every year because it's been, you know, it's flinging itself out. Technically, you were blowing my mind right now. So there's a lot of questions. You're saying in 50 years we won't have the moon anymore? No, I'm not saying that. Everybody quote them. And, and what's so funny to me about Pluto is Pluto's a cool planet. Pluto, we've never really seen. I mean, Pluto. So why, why did Pluto get downgraded? So Pluto's a dwarf planet because it, the, the, the definition of planet is that it has to be a large body that clears",

So Pluto's a dwarf planet because it, the, the, the definition of planet is that it has to be a large body that clears its orbit. And the orbit of Pluto crosses into the orbit of Neptune. Because you guys remember when you were kids, Pluto was actually closer to the Earth than Neptune was for a while. Then they crossed back over. So because Pluto doesn't have its own elliptical orbit around the sun, but rather crosses into another orbit, it is not a planet. Plus there are bigger bodies in, in the outer solar system than Pluto that we just didn't find at the time. Pluto is actually not the biggest dwarf planet. How many planets do we know about dwarf planets? Yeah, I think there's like 10 or 12 dwarf planets that are like of some significance. There's one in the Asteroid Belt too. But you know what? They like being called little planets. Little planets. Yeah, yeah. Um, but what's so funny to me is that we in 2005, we sent this",

We sent New Horizons, which is a probe like a Pluto. Pluto's so tiny. Pluto's like the size of the moon. Well, we've never really seen it. When you ever look at pictures of it, it's like two pixels. Yeah . And like we don't really know anything about it. You know, Charon, or Caron, depending on how you say it, is, is a, is uh, its moon. And we've never seen it either. We just know it's there because of like the way the planet wobbles. And in fact, they wobble around each other around a center, a point in the middle, which means that one and the other are like not that much different in size. They actually like rotate around a center space. What's the center space? Is that another planet? No, it's just like a point in between them.",

And it's, and that's like what's so cool is that we're finally going to see this fucking planet, you know? Like I'm really excited about it. What if we get there and you see cities? What proportion do they use to get something that far out in space? Is it solar? Yeah, it's solar. But like they, they use, you know what they call gravity assist. So like they'll send, I think with New Horizons, they actually sent it into the inner solar system and then it like swings around. Like it'll swing around Venus and like get a gravity assistance.

And they're talking about natural selection about how this happens naturally over longer periods of time. It's very fascinating. That's fucking clear. You gotta start watching it. Wait, so like dogs, like I know dogs, so not wolves, not crazy stuff, just normal dogs. When did those first come? Like they were domesticated over time?

So like they would keep them away. But then they would realize that the humans realized that the Cro-Magnon realized that they could encourage the wolves to protect them and bark and do all these things if they fed them. And then like created this sort of, you know, system where like one is being protected and taking, you know, and the other's being taken care of.

Like I'm so happy I cheated through math because I don't care. Like that's just so crazy. I'm so happy you exist. But, but I'm not one of the people that know it. And like we can say we don't care, but you know who makes all the fucking money? The mathematicians and the scientists. You know, they make all the money. The engineers. Yeah. You know, like the people that like computer sciences. They hate their lives. No, they don't.

See, I know, I know a bunch of pharmacists and doctors, retired people now. And like they're just drug dealers. They seem to, they're state senators, to really be happy with that because like, I don't know, I guess they feel like that's what they want to do. That's what makes them happy. So that's cool. I've never met someone that likes math that that's like doing like accounting or something and like, or like whatever the hell this is, they're fucking happy. Yeah, yeah. They're like, I have money.

Advanced Algebra was what did me in. Yeah, Advanced what? Algebra. I'm like, whatevs . And then they're like, oh, here's this advanced shit. I'm like, some, I somehow went all the way, I think we talked about this before, but I somehow went all the way up to higher math, which was college level math, like calculus.

I was actually in like, I think I had, it was in Physics, AP Physics, uh, AP Biology. Were you like Doogie Howser? No, I had no idea what I was doing. That was the thing that mystifies me when I think back to my high school career. I have no idea how I had close to a 4.0 grade point average and was like not failing every class.

Um, but like we're really good at like not actually doing the work, but looking at what work needs to be done and doing that. So like for me, the most work I would ever do in any class was the first week when you get the syllabus and you look at the syllabus and plan out, okay, this is exactly what I need to do to get an A. Guess what? Gotta fucking 10 A's because that's all I did. Yeah. Everyone else stressing out about all the other stuff. I'm like, I just need this. Okay , I'm going to do just this. It was fun.

Yes, show. But see what works here is this actually happened to Clay Aiken. And he was like, you know what? This did not happen to Clay Aiken. This happened to Clay Aiken.

No, there's a huge thing of like Clay Aiken putting gerbils up his ass. No, I don't know that. That's a Richard Gere. Everything. They just, every generation picks somebody. Okay, well, he was picked. And it's not, hold on. This is a conspiracy here. This, people are just being picked randomly.

If you like that, make sure you like us on YouTube, subscribe to the channel, share us with your friends. Remember that if you don't want the show broken up every Friday, we post the MP3 version for one dollar on gameovergreggy.bandcamp.com. You get to listen to it however you like. Then over on YouTube the next week, we start parceling it out day by day, topic by topic until Friday we get to the big show. It's all free there. Don't give us any money. We don't mind. But go buy a T-shirt. Why not? Tim, you like these T-shirts? Like you said, parcel. Yeah, that was fun. Thank you. I'm glad I entertained you. Yeah, they're fun T-shirts too. Yeah, exactly.
