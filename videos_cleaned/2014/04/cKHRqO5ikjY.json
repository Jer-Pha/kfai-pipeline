And uh, so I was thinking about them and I was thinking about Leonardo and his guit Han and I was think about Michelangelo and his his nunchucks and Donatello and his bow staff and Raphael and his sai. Yeah. And then I was thinking about The Hunger Games because I've been reading The Hunger Games and even though those books get progressively worse what I really like about because I'm reading the third one now which is worse than the second one which was worse than the first one the second Hunger Games book Total copout by the way absolutely **** about this a show and people wanted you",

We were like, like all my friends, all my friends started to go talking about Turtles rather than talking about Ghostbusters, so I could, I could tell the change was in the wind. But I was a big ThunderCats fan before I was the Ghostbusters fan. And then when you, if you compare the ThunderCats to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, it's a direct **** ripoff. Is it really? One of them uses a sword, one of them uses nunchucks, the other uses the bow staff. Like it's like frame by frame the same thing except they're cats instead of turtles. They been like a **** robot.

Well when Ninja Turtles first came about it was totally, I mean it was a joke and it was supposed to, it was making fun of, I don't want, I don't remember the exact specifics of this but um it had a lot of influence from Daredevil and a lot of other things and there was something else going on at the time that's like it is not a ripoff but like it originally started as not even an homage, it's like kind of a parody version of something else and then it became its own thing.

Did they actually play the music? No, the Ninja Turtles comic going on right now from IDW is by far the best Turtles thing to ever exist. Wow. I highly recommend it to everybody. It takes all the best parts of every other continuity and just puts it together as one thing. Um, half of the original creators work on it. It's awesome. What?
