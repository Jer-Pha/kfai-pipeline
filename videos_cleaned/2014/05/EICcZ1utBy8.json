I think well, everything is if you want it to be, but follow me on this one. Tim, you know, a while back you were like, Nick, you should get on Twitter because there's a lot of advantages to Twitter. And I'm like, I don't know, it's kind it's kind of seems like a waste of time. And now I'm wildly addicted to it. I love it. Tweet at me at Nick_Scarpino. Follow me. It's amazing. Um, it's amazing. But Instagram, I have yet to find a really good use for other than like looking at people's bodies. And I mean people, I mean guys too, because I follow The Rock and a guy named Dan Ban, who both have lives that are amazing and I want to live. But for the most part, every time someone says, hey, and they do the thing, look at this, it's an Instagram picture of a girl doing yoga. Yeah, and it's because of the caliber of people not wearing a lot. So I I put that to you guys, is Instagram safe for work porn? Okay.",

I guess you can follow people that do that. Take pull out the bottle of what just happened. It's been a long day. I'm sorry. There it is. Yeah, no, I mean, there's who who's the craziest person you follow you think? Craziest? I I brought this up multiple times now.

And then the people I follow, I'm mainly seeing like I'm not I don't for me, it's not at all porn. I don't follow anybody who's even a little porny. You know what I mean? Like on Twitter, I follow Key Key Ryan Key will put out **** today. She put up some ladies coming on Playboy TV and her tits are hanging on like, all right, glad that popped up on my screen at work or whatever. But on Instagram, I'm not following body like that.

What I thought Instagram like CU correct my for WR but Instagram got sort of a lot of people used it for food pictures, right? Me originally everything though q uter too. Like everything starts that way and then it ends at porn, right? But and that's what happened here too. But the thing is it's like I I follow a handful of people that I don't know that I just like looking at. Um most of them it's less porn and it's more just like oh, it's like amateur porn if you will. Yeah, but it's just like you're a very hot girl that is just living a normal life and I just want to see you do normal things.

It's a very suggestive yoga move where like basically she's just doing the splits toward you. Is that porn? No, it's yoga. Okay. Guy at a party with five topless strippers. Borderline. Is that borderline? Because I feel like that's porn. I feel like if the second someone has nudity in it, like it's pornographic. What is the definition of porn?

Like a lot of the things that you're talking about , they're not porn. They're just suggest. I think they're suggestively pornographic in nature where it's like, well, you know, I'll hold that thought. Let's define pornography in a second. Professor Moriarty to the floor. Porn informal noun, television programs, magazine , books, Etc that are regarded as emphasizing the sensuous or sensational aspects of a non sensual non-sexual subject and simulating a compulsive interest in their audience. So girls that are suggestively putting out their bodies to be looked at in a sexual way, yes, could potentially constitute his pornographic. Yes, it could potentially potentially so",

Um but I feel like 99% of the things that I come across that have to do with women are women like half naked that belong in sort of I don't know to me it's like Maxim, right? Where you're looking at Maxim magazine, you're like this might as well be Playboy and Playboy is porn. It is. Mhm.
