      "text": "[ Music] Tim, what's your topic? My topic this week, we were just talking about Taco Bell. Mhm, T-Bell, back on the fast food. We've talked about what our favorite fast food places are, right? But what are your favorite fast food burgers specifically? That's a really, so you go to McDonald's, there the numbers, which is the number, so if I can only have one burger from a fast food restaurant the rest of my life , are you, are you implying that your favorite burger is from McDonald's? Let him get to it. Don't spoil, don't go out and spoil everything. I think that's just plain old fashion wrong. Your God. So I am addicted to the Whopper. I don't know why. Oh my God, are you telling me your favorite burger is McDonald's? That's, they taste like sawdust. There's nothing in them. They don't taste good at all. The Chicken McNuggets on the other hand, the bomb, like the little tiny kids hamburgers, the bomb, not because of the meat itself, but because you get the fake cheese, SL, ketchup, SL, uh, uh, pickle, mustard. No, it's pickle.",

No, it's pickle, like the pickle and the mustard, onion, onions. Those are the, those things are gross, but they're not the best. That's not the, talking about the number two, the two cheeseburger meal, that's good. I don't know if it's number two. First of all, let's , let's clarify one thing right now. I didn't realize there were these types of people. I don't order off of the numbered men when I go, leaving money on the table. I know, why wouldn't you? He's a dollar man. I'm flush with cash right now. Okay, when I go to Taco Bell, they go, they try to SU me on that **** too. They're like, would you like a number two? Is that sounds like a number two? Do you want another two? You want to add a taco? I'm like, no, I don't want another two. I want what I want. Okay, I want you to rob extra money for me for no reason. I just want a nacho.",

You give me what I want . We've discussed this before. That's my problem with Taco Bell as much as I love them is I, there is nothing there, one thing that I'm like, just give me this. I always end up spending way too much money cuz I order way too much. I like ate soft tacos when I, you call me next time that happens, I will come and I will eat whatever's left over. A crunch, but wait, hold on, the Whopper. I say either the Whopper, I'll go either, I'll go either Whopper because it's very clean tasting. It's a very clean tasting flame boiled, boiled, boiled, bur be, fire grilled, fire girl, whatever you remember that when that the change over happened, no huge deal.

They're ons, good on rings are good there. When you get an accidental onion ring in your fries, I do every time and I'm convinced they put the damn thing in there just as like a, hey, thanks for coming. Maybe one these next time. I used to love my old , like my all-time favorite, probably the burg I've eaten most in my entire life was the double Western bacon cheeseburger from Carl's Jr. Double, a junior double bacon Western chees. That thing has like, until I realized when I went on a diet and tried to lose a little of weight, that thing has like, 1500 calories. It's disgusting. It's made with onion rings in it.

See, I'm a huge fan of the signature burgers that these places are known for. So like the Whopper is a big deal and I feel like the Whopper is the worst of the signatures. Okay, out of all the signatures, Carl's Jr., you got the $6 burger, right? No, that's not the, is that the signature? That's a big marketing gimmick, but that would, that, that's, I remember when they introduced that thing. Well, now every single burger they have essentially is a version of it. Okay, like that's, that is their burger. Then you know McDonald's got the Big Mac, Burger King got the Whopper. Big Mac sucks. Can I just, Jack in the Box has the, no, no, no, the um, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese.

So now, so okay, Big Mac is the ultimate burger guys. You, you are all so, so I will debate you on this and I'll tell you in a second, but their new burgers, this is the first time McDonald's going crazy. McDonald's never announces new food. That's the thing with them. That McDonald's right now, all the other, all the other chains have like new stuff all the time. McDonald's hasn't done that until like the last two years where they're actually doing different ****. Um, they now have new burgers, their first burgers ever to have Big Mac sauce besides Big Mac and like they're good. I remember, I remember going to McDonald's a lot and I'd get the cheeseburgers for a while and I'd get the McNuggets. I was a, I'm still a huge McNugget fan.

So you can order double cheeseburgers and just put Big Mac sauce on it. I did know, I didn't know that. I think I thought it was like Thousand Island wrestling. Yeah, which just cut you, isn't Russian drling the same thing as PR much ? Um, my problem with the Big Mac is this, so when I was a kid, I was like, I'm going to try F, I'm, I got to try this Big Mac. I was like, I guess I could hit that point in my life from my mom was like, whatever, it's too late, let him, let him just do whatever he wants to do. So I'm like, I want the Big Mac.

It's too much fake bread, much F bread. It's not unary, too much lettuce. I'm not a goddamn, there's a lot of lettuce and it's shredded lettuce. It's not the other kind of like everything's falling apart. You feel like you're in a Sahara Desert. You got to drink water, but you got a Coke in front of you. Big Mac is just so no frills to me. It's just like, like the Whopper is like **** balls to the wall. You want three **** patties on this mother slices cheese in every vegetable in your **** garden. We're going to do it right now.

Love you do the commercial, the little buy. Just if I had to guess and this is what I realized the day why I like the Whopper so much, they don't mix the sauces, right? So the Thousand Island dressing for all the, all of you out there is just mayonnaise and ketchup together with a little bit of relish. That's all it is. You can make it yourself at home. Um, the Whopper separates those two taste profiles if you will. That's a flavor profile when you get the ketchup on the bottom and just a, just a smattering of mayonnaise, not enough, it's not enough, but it's enough so that you're like, you're wowed by it, right? Where you're like, wow, they are hemorrhaging money on how much mayonnaise they're actually putting in the Whopper these days now and it just goes together so well with with the crisp onion.

This is the problem which is why you probably want to stick to the single Whopper, maybe the Double Whopper. Getting the triple Whopper is good if you're on team fat, but you might want to get prepared for a messy meal or maybe get a fork and a knife to finish it off. My mom was allergic to bread uh when I was growing up and so she used to get the Whopper in a like they used to just give it in a little like Sty rofoam box and just eat it right with a fork and a knife gets a little more sloppy ironically when you're eating it with a bun it's built to be a sandwich but let me give you this let me throw this into the mix the best burger because the best burger place is Five Guys and so",
