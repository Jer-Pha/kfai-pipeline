Happy birthday a Happ. He asked for a birthday shout out about a week and a half ago. Oh, it's also Christin's birthday today. Also, it's also Christine's birthday. Yes, happy birthday. Happy birthday. Uh, mine's pretty simple. This is a topic that did not come from Twitter, but if you have Twitter topics, please tweet at me, Nick Scarpino, and maybe they'll make it on the show. Um, if not, just follow Colin. Uh, my topic's weird. It's one of those I think about this a lot cuz I go back and forth on this. Um, is it better in today's society, in today's society, to be a guy or a girl? Guy, you think guy? Yeah, I think it's easier to be a guy. Yes. Well, that's what I'm going for by far, right? But there are certain advantages to being a girl, I think. Oh, yeah, sure. Lex, what what is your take on this since we have a girl here for the first time we can actually broach this",

Lex, what what is your take on this since we have a girl here for the first time we can actually broach this topic? Yeah, damn, I meant to bring a whiteboard and so we could R across the top shows without shows without a girl. What is it like days without incident shows without a girl? Like I just have to like erase the 21 and write zero. Um, I definitely think it's probably easier to be a guy. Would you want to be a guy if you could physically physically 100%? Come on, you don't do any of that monthly ****. I mean, I get this is how lazy I am when I have to go to the bathroom. I'm like , gee, I have to sit down. It's this whole really cuz I look forward taking off your pants. God, I can see that. I look forward to that. That's the only time in during my day that I do get to sit down like if I choose to and normally we're I'm just the journal, but sometimes I'll treat myself. You sit down all the time.

I'll I'll **** and I will stand up and start washing my hands and be like **** I got to pee and turn it off. How do you do you're kidding me? How ? I'm not. I'm dead serious. I only imagine what Steyr thinks half the time. Flushing of the toilet, handwashing, peeing noise, flushing of a toilet hand. What is the psycho doing in there? What how you really clean?

That's what it feels like to and I think most guys look forward to it . Am I wrong in assuming we all look forward to to going to the bath? Yeah, I love I love a good I love a good poop. But the problem is is that and this goes back to my stomach issues is that some of the poops are not good. A lot of the poops are b ades great. The the good poops are better this way, but then I wish the good poops took a little more time. See sometimes I go in with a Booker or I go on my laptop sometimes and I'm like you know I'm ready to go. Yeah, you're ready to go and then it just I'm like what the **** I like one paragraph of this story on Grantland and you're like G I've run in the laptop.

Now this is a this is a complex this is a complex issue though efficiency it is it effici I'm technically I'm technically multitasking when I do that yeah it's usually not intentional usually you pee and then you poop right at the same time you sit down really I I feel like one when that one like it's I send him in as like the Recon Scout and then when he gives me the all clear he'll stay there and the rest of the troops will come up to meet him you know and then they'll take the gate or whatever the hell whatever whatever going whatever military Arcane military it Nick oh Christ it's late in the day guys",
