Uh, I've been a big supporter of Comixology. It was something I had been calling for a long time. It's the reason I bought my iPad to read comics digitally, not to have to collect comics, to be happy reading them digitally , spending way too much money on comics. Tim, you do this as well. Nick, you've just begun. I have. I've just ventured into that. They got bought by Amazon not too long ago, last month. Big news. Oh, cool. They got bought by Amazon. Everybody's like, Amazon's going to ruin them and we're all like, nah, it'll be fine. Uh, they release a new, they close their old app. Yeah, it's not even an update, by the way. No, it's not even an update. They close their old app, create a new app. You have to go into and log into and the big thing is that there is no store anymore inside it on the on the digital iOS front or the Android front for",

They close their old app, create a new app. You have to go into and log into and the big thing is that there is no store anymore inside it on the on the digital iOS front or the Android front for that part. You have to go to the Comixology website, which is always exists where you could read comics online as well, but now you have to go there, buy your comics on the web and then they'll appear in your reader. You have to go download them in your reader. Kindle, yes, which Kindle used to be able to buy books in as well. Your Kindle app on your iPad used to be able to buy your books. Then when, when was that? That was a long time ago. Yeah, exactly. But never had cuz this is exact like, so this happens, people flip the **** out. Saturday, I woke up and the Twitter was a flame with people freaking out. This is the worst thing ever. They've ruined Comixology. They've ruined this. And my initial reaction was, yeah, this sucks.

But then you think about it and really it's just the, you know, screw job, no offense of the, or not even the screw job, but like how the in-app purchases work, that 30% of an in-app purchase needs to go to Apple, right? So for Amazon to come in, sell things through Kindle, sell through Comixology, now it makes sense for them to force you to this. And at first, again, yeah, like I get the knee-jerk reaction of, but I won't be able , I mean, like the, you know, the guy who wrote Punisher and did all this stuff, created Punisher, he's had, had like a long diet tribe, not diet tribe, but a long thesis on why this is horrible, right?

When new comics come out on Wednesday, I just have to change my mindset of, well, that I'll get them when I get home to. I'll check it out on a lunch break and see what I want buy this week and click, click, click and be done. Also, Comixology a few months ago before the Amazon acquisition introduced subscriptions where I love Invincible and I love Walking Dead and I love a bunch of other series. So I just click a button and I'm subscribed now. So I auto buy those every time they come out, every Wednesday that they come out of the month. So for me, not that much changes.

Uh, so that makes a lot of sense now because I thought I was going crazy because I, I opened up my Comicology app a couple days ago and couldn't and it told me to download the other one. I was like, that's weird. It's not an update. Normally it's just an update. So now I've got two Kology apps on my phone and I just finished Invincible 107 and I wanted to get, I wanted, I was like, okay, I have to know what happens next. I'm going to buy, uh, I'm just going to really quickly, you know, it's linked to my, my iTunes account, just going to buy 8, 9, and 10, right? And, uh, I could not figure out why it would not let me purchase and I, I logged in online, started a Comixology account, did it, doesn't ask me for any credit card information and I gave up.

I think it's actually worth the 30% for the ease of use that by the way, I dropped $40 on comic books. I bought like 40 issues just cuz I just marathoned through these things. Why? Cuz it's, you don't stop to think, right? You just go do that too. Oh, I got to get the next one. Oh , I got to and the, the only thing that stopped me was that I was literally falling asleep and I'm like, uh, okay, I, I'll table this until tomorrow. So I think it's going to hurt their business considerably in the short term. I'm sure Amazon has a plan because if there's one company that can go out there and actually take on Apple, it's Amazon, right?

Yeah, I mean, I, I've had the Kindle app on my iPad since 2009 and I've never had it any other way than me having to go to a site, one click order, send it to Andrew Jackson. That's the name of my iPad. And then I love it. I love it. And then BLS up. I think my wife has a Kindle Fire and I think she can just buy stuff directly from her Kindle. Well, yeah, you can do that to have an Amazon account. We're talking about the app, the Kindle Apple app is the same thing because it's run by Amazon. It, yeah, I mean, to me, so I'm not a comic reader, you know, whatever. I didn't even know Comixology was purchased by anyone. Uh, two things strike me as interesting.

So interesting to see, you know, Google does stupid **** all the time. No one ever say a word about it. It was interesting for me to see people get mad at Amazon because I've never seen that before, you know, like, like everyone loves Amazon. Everyone when Amazon Prime went up, everyone's like, ah, it's the perfect , that's great, who cares? Which I agree because Amazon Prime is awesome. Um, so that was, that was the first thing that struck me. I'm like, wow, people are being critical Amazon. This is a new frontier here on the internet.

That makes perfect sense to me to. I want to point out this that on the Android app, you can still pay through the reader with Goog with uh PayPal. Yeah, PayPal only. But jumping back to what I was saying earlier, it's Jerry Conway. Thanks for reloading that while I was reading it. Uh, co-creator The Punisher, he had this whole thing put up about how and the first line is, and so as we could have predicted, Amazon Rex Comixology and it's this whole thing and what he brings up is interesting to the the fact that he loves comic shops, but they're dying, right? And that this is, Comixology was the perfect portal to get people into comics, making split second PCH, you know what you're talking abouty, yeah, I'll buy another one, yeah, I'll buy another one, yeah, I'll buy another one.

You buy, no, it's not another step to jump through. It's like three steps to jump. No, it's cuz you're stupid and don't remember your, your password for Comixology. All you had to do on your new reader was log in with your, your name and your password and you were set to go. You have a Comixology account, but how does it download to your, to your phone through the actual app? It just sinks. It sinks. It's just like Kindle. I don't know. Does it do that actually?

There is the thing here of where there's on on device and then in the cloud. Got it. So I don't, I haven't fooled around enough with the app yet cuz it's new to me, but like every comic I've ever purchased from Comixology is here and I can just go and download them and even and like I can just click that one and download my last whatever 120 books I want to. Okay, yeah, I mean that is an extra step, yeah, and I and it's annoying, don't get me wrong, but I think what this is something we face in our day jobs when we're talking about video game companies and people freak out that Sony's charging this or Xbox is changing that or whatever, we, we're so quick to overlook the",

Like everybody, businesses exist to make money and get you the services you need, right? And like Amazon, I'm sure like they are a smart company, right? They must have weighed options of this 30% is costing us X millions of dollars. If we lose this, we're, if we change it, we're going to lose probably estimate this percent, but they'll come, this percent will come back and it's like it's got to work out. Yeah, they, they did a cost benefit analysis on that and they were like, we're losing, we're losing $40 million a year just to Apple. If we do this, we'll lose 20 million, so we make 20 million.

It like everything they're doing and everything they have going on is to **** compete with Apple, everything, you know, smart from like their, you know, their devices to, you know, to, uh, you know, the the Amazon box and the store and everything like everything they want Apple, you know, they want them. And so like it's not even about like them losing money to a third party of some sort, it's losing money to the company that they **** hate, true, you know, and so like that they, they buy things like Comixology just like they got made the deal with HBO to **** their competitors, you know, like the HBO GO deal or the HBO deal on Amazon Prime **** Netflix.

This, this really sucks for users, you know , because whenever a feature is taken away from them, whether or not they actually use it, like I, I don't buy comics from the iPad, like that's not something I would ever do.

But it's, yeah, I mean , I, I mean, for me, like the thing that draws me to comics is not necessarily art, it's of storytelling, right? It's the fact that you can get lost in a in a really fleshed out world that can be fleshed out over the span of hundreds of issues potentially.

Well, guess what? I also bought a bunch of them when they weren't on sale because I needed to know what happened and now those were like the five issues or the eight issues that I bought were, that's expensive, yeah, you know.

But I we have we have proof from before. Yeah, for a company so profitable, it's probably worth for them to eat it and make sure Apple doesn't get any of the money, right? And then the final thing is that the DC, Marvel, Image app, all that is run by Comixology and that still has in-store purchasing. Our good friend Little Sin tweeted a a photo that was funny of my iPad Saturday and it was just the Comixology app and then my iPad Sunday and it was each one of the publishers individual apps so that he can still purchase an app like that. So if it is a huge deal to you, you can still do that. I wonder how long they're going to keep that and if that's maybe a weird deal with specifically I",

I think it's a weird deal with who made your app because it's one of those things like obviously they're in partnerships with these people in DC Comics and everybody else. So if they were like, now we need to strip this out and DC's like, we don't want to deal with our fans flipping out, company X can start ing our comics digitally and then Comixology would crumble. Yeah, man, let the market sort it out. If you hate it so much, don't use it. Yeah, go to comic book shops again. I won't. I I'd go back to not reading.

I don't like it. It tells the story it tells it in a motion way. I think I think it's really cool. It's it's not ideal. I would prefer to do it on an iPad, but if it's just me and my phone waiting somewhere for a meeting or something like that, I just pop it open. It's awesome reading on iPad.
