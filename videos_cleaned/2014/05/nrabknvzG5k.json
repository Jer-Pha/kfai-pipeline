You got a lot going on here with your ensemble. What do you mean? You're pimping a lot of products. You mean I'm wearing the new Oreogasm shirt you can get at districtlines.com/gameovergreggy? You are wearing that. You're also wearing a lot of grease from Portillo's. The Portillo's. My birthday, ladies and gentlemen, is this Sunday. If you're watching the YouTube videos, it's already come and gone. I'm a year older and you didn't know. My dad from Chicago sent me Portillo's. It was the Italian beef package. Usually we get hot dogs. You've had them here before. The beef package worked out. It worked well. It was legit. It was excellent as Portillo's always is. I think that the Portillo's mail order beef is restaurant quality, whereas the hot dogs, I think, dipped down a little bit. What is this going to accomplish? I am covered in",

I am covered in gravy though from the beefs that I was making. You're going to shout it out? Yeah, I got the Shout wipes here. I was stirring the sauce, the gravy. I was getting kicked up. Then I got all over my new Oreogasm shirt that I can just go buy another one at a reasonable price at districtlines.com/gameovergreggy along with a slew of other shirts including Sean Finnegan's likes hiking gameovergreggy and the Scarpino boxing association. Established 1996. Also there's the Column for President shirt. Another fave. That's a staple. That's a classic. It's one of the founders of the gameovergreggy district line shop .

What a terrible, terrible platform. My topic, ladies and gentlemen, is piggybacking from a conversation with Colin, kind of. This has been talked about before and I came up this weekend. Christine and I were driving around talking about death and religion and God and what happens after, if anything. And I brought up the fact of referencing a conversation with Colin when we did the Ghosts episode, which spiraled into religion and everything else. Aliens. And how if, Colin said in that conversation, if aliens came to Earth, if aliens were suddenly made aware of what they were, they're out there, they're doing stuff. There's life intelligent outside of us. That religion, Colin said, would collapse. That would be the end of it. It would prove everything wrong.

They're blowing the top off a mountain in Chile to put a giant telescope on that'll be able to see outside of our solar system and get actual like up close with other planets and stuff. So like that was kind of where this all came from. Like if they find something, even that way , they find another civilization with things happening on it. What does that mean for the world we live in? That's what I want to know. I mean, I think the first question is, are they nice or are they not? They are nice.

It's not like Falling Skies, more like Contact. Right. And not like, not like Falling Skies, except in the, in the Contact. Nobody believes her. And they set up a wait for the next thing. It's more like the first contact where the Vulcans come, Star Trek, the Vulcans come and everyone's like, well, that's cool. And then they give us technology. And then we, it, it, you know, catapults us into space exploration. Is that how we all started? Yeah. The first contact is like what? It's like a prequel?

In that movie, it was about the Borg going back to stop first contact, which was the first time we, if I'm getting this correct, mastered that, the propulsion system that would propel us out into deep space. And we did a test run as a Vulcan ship was passing and the Vulcans have a, they have a methodology of contacting planets for the first time that have achieved warp drive. Yeah. So the only, if, if a civilization has progressed to the point where they've achieved warp drive and they go, okay, it's time for first contact.

We can't get to Mars. I actually, I actually, we got to Mars. We're going to suicide, suicide mission. Yeah. We'll see if they make it. I actually, I agree with you in the sense that we're not as far away as you think from like a lot of amazing technological advancements in space travel.

And we went to the moon, right? Right. If we just kept doing that, like kept spending money and we cared, we had a whole generation of people that cared, like our parents care. We'd be living on the moon right now. We would be like... I'd be buying a condo on the moon. It would be an amazing thing.

We can't even go to Mars. But it's not that we can't go to Mars, that we have enough money to go to Mars. Like we only spend like what, $17 billion a year on NASA? It's nothing. That's nothing. I know. We pay the Russians to bring our astronauts up to the space. We don't even have the space shuttle anymore. That's sad. And we're building a replacement for it . So Craig, I guess to answer your question, that's what I would be most excited about, right?

And then eventually when they didn't just destroy all of our, I mean, cause you know, the old theory that like anytime another, a more advanced civilization comes to a less advanced civilization, they tend to just decimate them. Europeans do that everywhere. So if they didn't do that, I think everyone would probably calm down. And then I think it would catapult us into an unpair, like an unprecedented era human existence.

Humans, I think it was Men in Black where he's like, one human is smart. What's the old saying? From Men in Black. The classic Tommy Lee Jones film. You know, it makes my classic reading with basically every movie that ever seemed since. But yeah, he has that great line in that movie where he says, he's like, you know, Will Smith says, why not just tell everyone? And he goes, he's like, people are smart.

So we then start just sort of picking at each other and buying into the fear. Right. And so I think that would definitely happen. No doubt. But are you looking it up now? Looking at Mars? What are you doing on your phone? I'm prepping to call Linda. Are you going to call Linda? Yeah. Don't call Linda. I want to say hi. Thanks. Tim, what do you got for me? What would happen?

In Independence Day, we were scared of them. And then we made a mind link with them when we learned they were there to destroy us. They were locusts. They were there to be nice people. It was obvious that they weren't there in a nice way since they had massive ships that were like over every city. Looming over our cities. Just walk up to them and say the universal greeting.

And they'd start fights. And then, then the aliens would be upset and they'd attack. Yeah. See what I want to know is what if the aliens aren't crazy looking and aren't anything.

Because like, correct me if I'm wrong, but like your thought here is that the Bible says like God created us in his image. So when aliens show up that are totally not in our image, that would be like for most people, like they're not in our image. Like for most people would like the, I guess this was wrong. And then the way I was describing it to Christine, right. It would be that there'd be this breakdown of people who had been on the fence or have like, you know, doubts or whatever. Like, you know, they don't know if this religion is right or whatever, this would happen. And they would be like, well, this is clearly not what it is in the religious right. Would snap so far back",

I disagree wholeheartedly because I feel like the power of religion is that they can just shift, they can just pivot. Right. So if that happened suddenly, you know, you have religions, like the fringe religions, like I guess like Scientology, right. Which would just, oh, we discovered another book that talks about this. Right. And then after 10. But that's the fringe religion . Yeah, but after like five generations, right. Like when we've been living with these people, first of all, these aliens for so long that look like us, then all of a sudden it's just, it's just becomes a part of the religion.

And so if we could somehow incorporate that sort of acceptance of those new people into it, I think religion would continue to flourish. Well, see, I think it would evolve, maybe change into something else. I'm sure these things coming here have their own ideology, something else they've been raised with. Unless they look exactly like us. If they look exactly like us, that's going to be the mind fuck. So everyone would be like, holy shit.

Do you have anything? And I feel like forever we'd just be talking to them, trying to figure out what's different about them. I mean, how fundamentally disappointing is it going to be if a humanoid alien shows up, looks like us, and doesn't have superpowers? We are setting that poor alien up for just a ton of failure.

A lot of people, and I actually agree with this particular premise, think that if the aliens came here or contacted us, it is not for friendly reasons. There's no reason for them to do that. But other people argue that there's no reason for them to be hostile. But I think that the independence they think of coming, or even signs they think of coming to the planet because there's something there you want, I think is actually somewhat reasonable.

But they know we're there and when they leave us alone, they watch our evolution. They don't want to interfere. And that's possible too. I just think in terms of the ramifications, good or bad, everything's good. That is the biggest, the day that the nations of the world get on TV or whatever and the UN or whatever, we have contacted aliens.

The fact that if Superman showed up tomorrow, and this is the other thing too, we're so familiar with Superman and everything. We don't even think it's weird that he's this alien strange visitor from another planet. But in Smallville, season 11, the comic book, they deal with other aliens and magic and all this stuff starts happening in their universe.

We should stop recording this because someone's going to steal the genius ideas that are coming out from this. What would your kids, what would your tween book be about? Well we're not working about me. We're worrying about you. The series should be called Vamp in the Night Away. And it's about an improv vampire who's trying to change his ways but he can't until he meets Lucille Tidwell a thirteen year old young upcoming improv actress. At thirteen now she's doing the series.

There was a place called Time Out near my house on Long Island. Named for the Zack Morris move? Exactly. I used to go there in the late 80s with my brother. My brother's a big gamer back in the day. What I really loved about it, the reason arcades died by the way was because the NES era was the first era where there could be arcade parity between machine and console. If you remember correctly, Pac-Man on Atari 600 was considered an abomination. That game sucks, right? But by the time you could get Pac-Man running properly on an NES, it's just more powerful.

Walk behind, watch these usually terrible players play. Step up and then, you know, stay on the machine for a while. You just keep playing and then people would come and challenge you. That was fun.

But then I remember, I'll never forget it, in high school we were leaving Target or whatever and my friend had gotten ahead of the group and was up at the claw game. He's like, man, look at that Wonder Woman thing. And I'm like, aw. And I put it in a quarter, did two moves with the claw and go, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, Wonder Woman.",

The claw game used to piss me off. You got to have the eye. Yeah, but the claw game used to piss me off because there was so much frivolous shit going on with the claw game because you would get it right over, I understand what you're saying. You'd catch the corner of your eye and you'd look at it and you'd be like, that thing's peeking up high enough. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If the claw turns. And then you'd approach the machine.

Yeah, it would drag it and knock everything down. I don't think I've ever once picked anything out of that claw, that damn machine. Never once. I think I've won a few times, but not many. No, not many at all. Because there was a diner in New Hampshire when I lived there that had the claw game. I used to go there all the time with my mom. And I used to play it every time I was there. Every time. $ 50 total on that thing over the years. Won maybe like a shitty teddy bear or something like that. See that's the worst thing about the arcade, like the tokens and the tickets and stuff.

So my question to you guys is, there was almost, we were on the precipice of another era about two years ago. Two years? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, four years ago probably. Four years? Maybe five years ago. Just fucking spit it out. When Neil Blomkamp was developing a script for Halo. The Halo movie. And that was gonna be a big deal because Peter Jackson was backing it.

Because they had this great property that they knew was gonna be a hit. And so the deal they were trying to push in front of those studios was really, really, really not good. But the Neil Blomkamp script leaked. I just downloaded it. I'm gonna read it probably tonight or tomorrow. And I've never been a huge fan of Halo. Halo was never... I mean, I played it, I played it. It was one of those experiences where I'm like, this is really cool as a co-op experience, but for the most part I'm not into the multiplayer or the single player.

So I guess my question to you guys is when do you foresee an era? It's gonna happen. It's gonna happen. When will it happen? When will the video game movie era happen? See, I would argue that it already happened. Alone in the Dark doesn't count. Doom . Final Fantasy: Spirit Within. Like, on all that, like... That sucked. Those are all bad movies. But like, you know, we got House of the Dead. Sucked. Yeah, dude. House of the Dead was really bad. I was about to fight that. I don't know why. I just got confrontations.

What about Street Fighter: Legend of Chun-Li with Kristen Curry ? What about Street Fighter with Jean-Claude Van Damme? Hell yeah, I was gonna say that was the fucking bomb. So all of those movies are very, very... They run sort of parallel to what was happening in comic books before the X-Men series sort of hit and then of course the one that really sparked it, which was Iron Man. Those movies remind me of that time before the pre-X-Men era when they were flirting out trying to do like a Punisher movie. They had a Captain America movie back in the 80s. They were trying to get Spider-Man off the ground, right?

So and that's gonna happen with video games because the video game industry is only getting bigger. The movie industry is only, is starting to, well actually it's not starting to, is smaller in comparison. So there's gonna be a convergent point where mainstream culture goes and it just needs one big breakout movie for all the studios to jump on board and say we're gonna start buying up all these properties.

There's a lot of video game movies that exist, but they're not theater movies, or some of these are. I'm talking widespread release. Yeah, because... Live action. Live action. Well, doesn't that be live action? Fuck off. Because Smash Bros. could be an awesome anime. Oh, I would love that. Like a CG movie. Yeah, that'd be good. That'd be amazing. But I really enjoyed the Final Fantasy VII movie. It's not perfect, and it fucks a lot of things up. Spirits Within? No, that's... Spirits Within was a horrible, horrible thing.

The theme song was a badass rock version. God, I loved that. But Smash Bros. is the easy, obvious answer. How do you make a movie about Smash Bros. unless it's a comic, a comical movie, right? You gotta put all those characters together. It's gonna be like Wreck-It-Ralph. Well, the story... There was the story in Brawl, the subspace emissary, and it's fucking bullshit, but it's like they all come across each other and then they start fighting because they're like, oh, who the fuck are you?

People now know how to make an awesome fucking comic book video game. Give it talented studio time, a license, go. What does Activision do? Continue to shit out Spiderman games. We have all these amazing properties. They don't do anything with them. Nobody's pulling the trigger on a Superman game. There isn't an amazing... X-Men Destiny was disastrous.

There was no Crash Bandicoot movie. And that's goddamn shame. But that's insane. I mean, that just goes to show you like the heavy lift. Like Crash Bandicoot, as you know the guys from Naughty Dog tell me when I did my history of Naughty Dog was, that was, the Q score on Crash Bandicoot was higher than Mario and as high as Mickey Mouse in like 1998. Really? It's like that was like fucking... No one was beating Pikachu in 98. Depends on when in 98. I mean, Pokemon didn't even come out until fall of that year.

It really was, Pokemon Red and Blue were really big. It was really yellow that made people go back and appreciate the heritage of it. I don't know about this. That seems wrong. No, it's true. Like Pokemon wasn't a thing really until... Don't look at me, I have no idea. I can't be where. No, I mean, I know. I mean Pokemon wasn't... I think we caught them all! Pokemon!

I think Uncharted would be a difficult movie to make and I think The Last of Us is a fucking terrible idea for a movie because... Because unless they do a completely different story in that universe... They've already said they're not. Because it's cinematic already, it is a movie. And here's the big problem with all this, is the thing that I would like to imagine that as video games continue to mature, we mature with it, the industry gets bigger and bigger, we move away from this belief that we need to have a movie. You know what I mean? You don't need to have a movie. The games are these experiences and these touching things that you'll never be able to recapture. You know what I mean?

See I don't think it's an either or, right? I think the movie helps keep the property alive, right? And it keeps it... It gives you a new experience. And hopefully Neil's smart enough, and I know he's smart enough, to give people just different enough an experience to make it meaningful.

And they're really doing some cool work. I just watched Wreck-It Ralph. It wasn't my favorite, but it was a cool movie. And it does... You could take any of these properties, like Banjo-Kazooie, any of these, and make them into CG movies. Interesting, because they're doing that with Ratchet and Clank. Don't forget TJ Fixman writing it. Oh, yeah. I'm actually excited for that. Which could be really cool, right? It could be, yeah. And so Smash Brothers, literally, you have to do it.

You just said good-looking. You didn't say you didn't want more. You didn't give me things. You could put Emily Rose in there. There you go. Emily Rose is good-looking. Elena Fisher herself.
