And the reason I, I ask you guys about this is because, and, and gals, is because, uh, I've been reading a book by Blake J. Harris that Greg provided me for, uh , and it's not out yet. It comes out really soon. It's called Console Wars: Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle That Defined a Generation. Um, a good, it's, it's a meaty book. It's about 500 pages long. The text is kind of big though, so you could probably fit it on 300 if they were a little, a little tighter on that. But it's a fantastic book and it tells the story of Nintendo's dominance of the industry, well, Atari's fall, Nintendo's dominance of the industry, and then, and then the first fight that Sega had with, with Nintendo over the Genesis and the Super Nintendo. So I was just curious what your, what your guys and gals collective",

So I was just curious what your, what your guys and gals collective thoughts were about those consoles as a kid, which side you fell on, you think you ended up being on the right side? Because to me, I was a Nintendo kid through and through, NES kid, and then a Super Nintendo kid. I didn't have a Genesis until later. I bought a Genesis in high school, um, on eBay. Um, and that's because I found a copy of Castlevania: Bloodlines brand new at Toys R Us. I have no idea how I did that. It was like 1999, so that was like totally awesome. I should have bought them all. They had like 10 of them. I could have got a **** fortune. They were all sealed. Uh, but I was, fortune is a, that's, that's those, if I kept those today, those would each be worth like $100. So that's pretty good, pretty good investment. They're like 10 bucks each.

And like, I felt like, I felt like Super Nintendo was like such a dominant console, like it's such an amazing console and it was really close between them. Super Nintendo ended up beating Genesis ultimately, but, um, Genesis out, outpaced Super Nintendo for a long time actually. I feel like, I think Super Nintendo, we're talking about Super Nintendo, right? Not the NES obviously is better than Master System. I don't think so. I always felt like, and this is just a weird part of my psyche, that whatever anyone else has is inherently better than whatever I have. And I don't know why I think that, but my friends, a couple of my friends had, had Genesis and I was, I was just envious cuz it was, it was the Allure of the other, you know, like you knew what you",

Hey, Partillo is here. There he is. He's been on this whole show. I'm well documented as a Sega kid, got the Sega Master System all because it had, it was the first Ghostbuster game I saw and that was it. No research done by me and my parents, you just had to have it. Yep, it was that addictive. Like what a **** blunder you had. Well, see now stick with me here cuz I'm a Sega kid.

So I was just spoiled by everybody. And so yeah, got a Game Gear, had the Game Boy, but it was strictly a Sega kid and looking back now, a video game journalist, objective, knowing the industry, I had such a raw **** deal. I made, I bet on such the wrong horse. Like I miss so much good **** on SN regular Nintendo part of me. That's part of the reason why I have had such decision on what, what next gen console to get cuz I don't want to make, I have this weird, I just don't want to make the wrong.

Um, and then like Genesis and stuff was over at my cousin's house. They had like every console and like going over there was awesome. Did you actually play games when you were growing up? Yeah, well just casually. Yeah, when we, my cousins were really hardcore gamers and then in my household like they were super strict, my parents. So your parents are so strict?

This is worth the $30 or however much it was back then. I don't remember how much, how much were NES games? They were a lot. They were 40, 50 or depending on the, depending on the, uh, I always felt guilty for asking for them. My mom just like always constantly made me feel guilty for asking .

We're going to be living out of tin cans or something eventually. And so that was the concept I had trouble wrapping my head around as a kid that no, no, he's fine. This is how it works. This is how the job works, you know what I mean? That never factored into anything when I grow. I had no idea of my parents'finances growing up nether. Well, I didn't know they were like rich or poor, but I mean, I, you know what I mean? Like when your dad's home, you're like, oh God, there's no, I only understand it from like, you know, my dad was one of those like classic Mad Men style dads where he'd come home from work super late, he'd leave super early and then when he got home from work, he would eat dinner with us potentially or we had already eaten chances are then he",

He was like a public administrator, but then he'd come home and do like real estate stuff cuz the the family at the time owned some real estate interests. So yeah, he would and also I think he just didn't really want to interact that well with my mom.
