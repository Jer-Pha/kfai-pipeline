It's just a It's a small place in SoCal in the Inland Empire. The IE, as they say, the IE what um it's about 40 minutes, I guess, inland of Orange County, if you're familiar with that.

Cement tends to get cold at night. Woke up the next day totally fine . Like, oh, this is great. A little hot, sweating. So, did you fall asleep shadow boxing? No. Uh I fell asleep uh drinking with my brother. It was a great great night. It was one of the first times we bonded when I was young. It was really cool. We were just kind of chilling out.

And I often talk about Long Island, but I don't talk about my town of Brookhaven. Brookhaven. Brookhaven is a hamlet. And uh which means that it's it's a pretty large piece of land , a large area, and there's a township and then the hamlet, which is the greater area of it. Um, the beauty of being on Long Island is that, and I've always felt this way, and I've always explained it to people, like whenever you're in a different part of the United States, right?

If you're in Glenn, maybe someone's going to Indianapolis, right? If you're on Long Island, you're on Long Island and you're there because you want to be. You didn't take a boat and you hit Long Island. You're like going through Long Island. I get to take a boat on the other side. Go somewhere. There is literally no reason to go to Long Island. In fact, you have to go out of your way to go to Long Island. Instead, if you're in the city, you go up to go to Westchester and White Plains and then New England. You go south to go to New Jersey. You go, you know, you know, kind of northwest to go to upstate New York. And then you go east if you want to go to Long Island. If you go to Long Island,",

So, I always really like that to explain that about Long Island is that it's just a place where like there's tourists out east in the Hamptons. We're going to the Hamptons, but otherwise Long Island is basically just people that live there, right? And so, I've always really liked that. Like, you don't, you know, so I always have this concept that Long Island is just a bunch of like really cool houses, but no one works in Long Island. Like, they all go to the big city to work and then they come back and they live in Long Island. Yeah. A lot. I mean, Long Island's most Long Island has industry has a big computer industry.

And there's but a lot of it is basically service and construction of things that are going on Long Island for money from New York City, right? That's the way it always is. My dad worked in New York City. So, the pros of Long Island are are, you know, generally are the beaches. You're never more than about six and a half miles from a beach, no matter where you are in the city in Long Island. How many, I guess, months can you actually go on the beach? You would say from like May to September. And is it good beach or is it like pebbly? There's some excellent beaches and there's some pebbly beaches.

And then on clear as day depending on depending on what part of you know part of the island you're on. If you're out more Nassau where the the the angle's shorter. Um, and then on the south side, the uh on the southshore is the ocean. And what's ironic, much like San Francisco where the ocean is the cheaper part to live in, the southshore is the cheaper part to live in. People want to live on the on the on the sound.

I think New York pizza is better than Chicago style pizza. Our Chinese food in Sichuan is amazing. Um, etc. and so on. We have a Heroes HRO. Okay. Yes. Which are subs, hot subs. So, we have all those kinds of things. And I would say that the second pro of of Brookhaven is nature. Now, Long Island is way overcrowded. Way way way overcrowded. And when people say on Long Island, people use the term out east on Long Island, just like we use the word upstate in in New York to to describe everything that's above Long Island in New York City.

Well, it's split into Brooklyn, Queens, and then Nassau and then Suffic. And Nassau and Suffic are really considered Long Island. Okay. The other two are part of New York City , but they're on Long Island. And Nassau's really really over like really ridiculously like there's not like it is a **** **** show out there because everyone from the city moves to to Nassau and they work in the city and it's just sub it's just one huge suburb.

So, it's a big island. Yeah. Um, so when you start going like I'm on the cusp of like, you know, on one side of us are basically like overgrown suburbs. On the other side is like where it starts to get a little more natury and there are trails and like forests. We have like huge pine forests and stuff out east. And then on the other side of those farms and the forests are the Hamptons and that's like where all the super rich people, the rich people party.

So I would say the pro pros of Brookhaven are the food and the nature which you don't get in a lot of other places. Brookhaven's beautiful for that. The cons are as such. You live in the shadow of the biggest city in the United States and probably arguably the greatest city in the world. Now, this is a pro in many ways , but also a con in some ways because everyone's obsessed with going to the city, right? All of the time, when you're a kid, you want to go to the city, let's go to the city and see a play. Let's go to the city and see a Rangers game. You want to go to the city and see a Yankees game?

And the weather is different because we have the muggy **** summers and moderately bad winters, but not so bad because it's mitigated by the water. So, we actually got a lot more rain than we do snow. But we get really bad we get hit really bad with two things. Once in a while, we get slammed by hurricanes as we did with Sandy, which destroyed parts of Long Island and parts of New Jersey where my beach house is, which we're rebuilding.

So that's a significant amount of people. One in five people in in San Francisco is Chinese. And that's very that's a huge amount of people. But in Daily City I read a stat that there are only two cities Yeah. There are only two cities in the United States of 100,000 people or more where over half the population is Asian and one is Honolulu and one is Daily City. Wow.
