No, it sounds fun. Yes, Portillo's. Close, yeah, close enough. I went there too. So, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, it was goodness. That's what they call. I don't know if they call. They did for a long time. That's the language. VidCon's there too, and every year we go and you fuckers are like, ooh, maybe this will be the year. No, it's not. I tell you every year it won't be the year and you're, you let Nick string you along every time. But like on Sunday, we're extremely the fuck along. I, I just like, that's too mushy. We can just go. It's right. Go. And I see it. I think Emily, the Ferris wheel. Kevin sees my eyes that we're fucking with you. He goes, dude, let's go. I'll go. I'm on there right now. It's fierce. So it's some shit. So I haven't been to Disneyland for two years, which is not acceptable. I've been there at least once a year since I was 18.",

I love Disney, specifically love Disneyland. And I want to go with all you fuckers one day. Well, what would you go do DisneyBounding while you're there? Do you dress as a character? Casually dressed as a character? Isn't he designed? Is DisneyBounding? Have you heard about this? This is where you don't go full cosplay, but you choose an outfit from your wardrobe that is indicative of a character. So like a shirt, no pants. Got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just red shorts. If you went just ready, what's this shirt with no pants? Okay, like maybe don't do that. I run a pantsless Sailor. They have a, I have to watch them. They have to watch me.

Because we're just gonna talk about this. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm, I missed it. I genuinely have big-time. My thing is fascinating about this as I talked to you. I was like, how much could it possibly have changed between the last time I was there, like six years ago, and now? And you were like, oh, don't forget Star Wars. Yeah, I mean, right.

But it was just gonna be me and these two chuckleheads talk about Disneyland. It on my, uh, uh, Boyz II Men. I just can't do that. I can't do it. Okay, just, just put this shit out there. My excitement. It was one of most exciting weekends of my life. Nick, I, I mean, yeah, I grew up not far from Anaheim. So I've been Disneyland a number of times. I have friends that have gone in to work there. I've got, you know, I've been in there quite a few times. It's never, I've never been crazy excited about it though.

You are having to walk everywhere. Mm-hm. And then maybe you get a churro. But then even then your mom is like, no, it's too expensive. You get, you can't have that, the third churro. And I'm like, but I want a third churro. So you do that. I'm lazy. We all were. Many, many, many reasons. One, you need to go to Disneyland as an adult so you can buy your own churros as many as you fuck please. No one likes having good. I'm Kevin, dear man. How many churros did you have at Disneyland, Kevin? There's four in your hand. Okay, of churros as you got back there. Hundred, sir. This entire cart is filled with churros. Yes.

So, so tell me about your disease. Okay, this all started at VidCon last year. I guess this year, last VidCon. Did you go on the official VidCon? No, Danny fuck won't let me. Okay, so we gotta get home, make, make content. We did. We did a meet-and-greet. Gotta get back to the conference. You, Greg Miller, Greg meet-and-greet Miller for tell us over at Portillo's.

I'm interested in the story again. Thank you. Okay, leave the door open, Nick. So wait more. This is, this is like one of those revolving door podcasts. Can I like running in a snack? No, you. I've never once gotten up during this show. Would you like a kale salad? No, I'm good. I'm good. I'll hang. Okay, we have deep-dish pizza. Wow. Well, I'm feeling that a little bit. There's, did you give me a coffee? As long as you're up. Do you have any hot towels? A hot towel would really be on the back of Kevin's neck for 90 seconds. You advertise.

Left one sweats easier and faster. I don't know why. Maybe because it's dominant hand. I'm doing more. It says something to do with my posture. I don't work on their muscles. Yeah, who knows? Well, I don't know. Left pit usually stained. Anyway, it just dawned on me to Nick, this is not how long pees take. What's going on, Nick? You having a poop, Nick?

Tell me about there, the romantic Disneyland story. And they're like, if you ever need to get into Disneyland, let us know. We'll get you in. And I'm like, I'm all about that. Try to convincing you fuckers to go that next day. You're like, no. And am I, all right, fine. I'm gonna wait. Let me use this. I'm gonna remember you. So I got his email.

Got me too. He was a scared little, oh, scared little Kevin. He wasn't quite as round than he was really tiny though. Um, so, so there's that. Then my two of my best friends, James, Missy, this couple in love with Disneyland. And they are the second reason that you're doing Disney not wrong, Nick. You need to go with them. Okay? Because they are just like, you know, when you go someone, you have to pay for like a tour guide and they'll tell you to all the places you need to go and like skip all the lines because they know everything. That's them for Disneyland. And you can hit everything. You avoid all the lines. You, they have this FastPass. Is staying at the FastPass. Get the bracelets. I see there's your world. There's also",

And all of a sudden, because you're around that much positive energy, you're like, oh, I like this movie more than I thought I did. You know, like, oh, I'm really into this. Going to Disneyland with somebody who genuinely feels whatever Disney magic that you are not attuned to. You know, because I grew up in Orlando. I hate Disney usually because Disney World was just like where you worked in high school. You know, so I have this thing where like, I couldn't love Disney World.

Have you been on Jungle Cruise? Course I've been on Jungle Cruise. Is the best thing in the entire world. There's these freakin' tour guides and the entire thing is just a bunch of the worst puns in the world. And I was on Jungle Cruise with a bunch of the StarWars.com team and Scott Bromley. And we all screamed at the conductor, the Jungle Cruise, until they let Scott Bromley run the Jungle Cruise. I saw, I saw, fine. You want to know a man who was born to do something? The Comedy Button. Scott Bromley was born to be a Jungle Cruise. On every job. Give up everything he's ever done. Cause that man is just a fountain of dad jokes.

So you're going around with this couple in this couple and they have an annual pass and they're from San Francisco. And they go like once a month. So they drive down there once a month and do this shit. They're hard fuckin' core about it. I, I love Disneyland, but I don't need to go that often. So I try to hold off and then I'll go with them. Do it right. Do a Big Bounce out. So now I'm like, we've been planning this thing with Kevin and his friend Paula for a long time. Cause she, she's been before, but she's never done it right.

And it was the best goddamn weekend of my life. Cause we get there, we hit everything, right? We went on every fuckin' ride. We didn't wait in hardly any line. So it was just like, we just FastPass whatever. The girlfriends run into another thing to get FastPasses for the group for the next ride and cycle. It was like a well-oiled machine. And FastPass to me, you run and check in and you get FastPass.

It sounds like way too much effort. When you're with somebody who knows the ins and outs of it, it's not effort. It's just, it's ingrained into there. Exactly.

They're working on Star Wars Land. So what, so what's happening is we knew we had to go this weekend, this November 1st weekend, because it was the first weekend of the Star Wars shit. And it was the last weekend that was not blocked out cause of like Christmas and holidays and all that stuff. Because on January 10th, they're getting rid of Disneyland.

Yeah, but Norway is just like, and that's when the ice princess got her magical powers. Anyway, Norway, socialism and ice princesses. We'll see you later. Yeah, so, so they're getting rid of the Aladdin show, which is amazing. And they have this Genie that does like improv comedy. I'm trying to get to host Kinda Funny Live. We'll see how that goes.

Now you go, alright, Space Mountain. Is that my favorite? Is when they get rid of the safety bars and they run it is faster. But instead of it just being like the countdown, the music playing. So Colin, if you don't know what Space Mountain is, it's a rollercoaster. Are you fuckin' kidding? I don't fuckin' know. I don't know your history. I've been to Disney World and Disneyland more than anyone in this room. Just wanted to throw that over there. And then I'm just gonna push for my microphone away. That's not really true.

But there's a rollercoaster indoors and they turn off all the lights and there's like stars everywhere. So it looks like you just flying in space. Groovy music, music playing. Synthesizer space music is playing. Bouncing spaceship. The sixties. When, when rollercoaster technology was more about giving you whiplash than doing loops and stuff. Yeah. So it's just constantly like listing you from side to side. Yeah. And like doing little drops to like keep the G-force up. So you're just constantly crushed. My favorite ride hands down at Disneyland since I, alright, we're gonna make it even better. It's gonna be Star Wars theme. So the entire line, it's all this like Star Wars shit playing.

It's like, oh cool, even more and you shit it. Wait, how is it how is it faster than Space Mountain normally, but also take longer? That's impossible. Time Warner getting the beginning is slower so that lasts longer. Longer, you mean the the most boring part about not boring, it's not boy when you're in a tube of Star Wars. Okay, trust me.

You're watching a projector and they added a whole Force Awakens' bit that's guaranteed. It's a randomized thing. Kylo Ren does not.

They got rid of it around the time of all that, you know, child stuff. Well, you die. So it's been their last couple years, but then now they take it away whenever there's Marvel movies and stuff. They'll make like special trailers for it. So now even though there's mommy was something more important, there's Star Wars movies.

I recommend a Falcon's Mission. It's a great name for pizza. Then there's this building you go into and you can buy a bunch of Star Wars shit, obviously. And then there's you can beat Darth Vader. You can meet Chewbacca. They have a whole bunch of the like actual suits from the movies, like all the various movies and props, all that stuff.

Yeah, they don't really say it anymore, but like in 1977, jizz wasn't slang. Mm-mm. Like it just wasn't. So what's jizz music in the future? Oh, it's jizz because it's from space. Got it. Jizz music.

No, it's not impressive anymore. It's it's a window into the 60s. That's one of the things that I like the most about Disneyland as opposed to like Disney World is I went to Disneyland for the first time a couple years ago and it is a window into 1960s America. It was built then. It looks like it was built then. It's like somebody built.

So Disney, my head, besides the rides and all that stuff, what it's really known for is its shows. So there's a whole bunch of different shows. There's Fantasmic!, which is this amazing thing with it make you fight a dragon is the shit best thing in the entire world. But there anything that you said, they're ending it for two years until they're done with Star Wars. Like, okay, Disney, don't ever. Yeah, it's going to the ball.

Like everything like these fountains come up and they start projecting colors onto the fountains and this like 60s lady choirs like what was cool about this. I've seen World of Color a bazillion times at this point and this one is the it's the 60th anniversary. So they have a new thing and Neil Patrick Harris is leading the whole thing. It's kind of weird, but like I'm always into it. I was it's not as good as the first World of Color for sure, but for someone saw it, something that's cool.

Some of the fountains are fire and the first time that happens, it surprises the hell of you because fire doesn't come out of ponds. Gone wrong. We need to evacuate the wall. The elements have gone topsy-turvy. The World of Color has been compromised. It's amazing.

Then the last show is the fireworks, which are amazing and they have a new 60th anniversary show. And so they kind of the fireworks, whether it's the main show.

Tinker Bell is a union job because you can see her face. She works every day, so she has to be an employee and she gets stunt and hazard pay.
