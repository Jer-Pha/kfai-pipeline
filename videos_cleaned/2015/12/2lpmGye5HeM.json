You know how many pumpkin pies I've **** taken down in the last week though, Greg? How many? Oh, way too many, 'cause I live in this world.

Uh, I'll explain it from the start, I guess. It's a good place to start. It a place to start. We used to be called Cherry Sauce Clothing. And we, we started off in the music industry, selling it like Warped Tour and stuff like that. And old Warped Tour. Yeah, we realized really quickly that we weren't cool enough for the music kids. And we were like, way too nerdy. So, uh, we switched our branding. We did like, Zombie Mario. You're, you're already, you're already **** it up. You said you start at the beginning.

Uh, we used to play WoW all the time. And not like a little bit. Like, he would come over every Friday night after work and stay until Sunday evening. And we wouldn't sleep. And we just play WoW all the time. And that led to like a really depressed state of what am I doing with my life? And we decided we'd start a bus. Story started off so sweet. No, no, we still, we still love and revisit WoW all the time. Uh, but it sort of got, it's what got us to be friends actually. 'Cause I, I, he's an acquaintance of mine. And I invited him over to play WoW. And this led to this quest thing together, becoming friends. And then wanting to start a bus to do something more with our lives. And we like, what about.",

And we like, what about a recording studio? What about all this? And then we, we realized it's really expensive to start a business. So clothing seemed like a, a good reasonable mid-level thing to start. So we took out a loan for like 14 grand and put together our first line. And only our friends bought it. It took, it took two years to sell all those shirts we spent 14 grand on. And what were your initial running shirts? What do they look like? They're really cartoony. Like, picture band shirts, but instead of blood and black and white, it's super colorful. Like, weird **** on them. Like, robots blowing bubbles. Like, really colorful.

Because games are our thing. Sure. And that's when we shifted towards that. And we did those Pok\u00e9mon minimal shirts. And those after a cease and desist. Yeah, they did quite well for a while. So wait, how long did you go where you're just like, did you launch and like, I'm sure no one will care if we use Pok. It worked for a year. And then we got to New York Comic Con last year. And we had a cease and desist. And we didn't know if it was real or not. So we like, called their law team. And no one responded to us. So we just kept selling them.

It's cool. Um, but yeah, we, we eventually did these Filthy Casual shirts. I guess we were doing a Twitch stream. And we were playing Dragon's Crown. And Jason was texting his girlfriend at the time and soloing a, we all wiped. And he was the only one left. And he soloed a boss with one hand while texting. And one of the guys in chat is like, \"You guys are the **** filthiest casuals. Like, this is an awful stream.\" So jokingly, we made shirts. And they sold out. Sold all of our other stuff. Oh, we might be on to something here. So, uh, after selling those and those sort of becoming our, our public facing thing, we rebranded like almost a year ago now. Oh, wow. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

We rebranded probably about a year ago now. Um, and, and with that, we sort of changed our message in that, uh, Cliff Bleszinski had that really cool quote where it was like, \"I was never nerdy enough for the nerds and, or not cool enough for the cool kids.\" Whatever. And that's sort of like where we fell is we wanted to make our own, own cool kids group. This like welcoming family for people to feel like they're a part of it and be a part of a brand.

It's like, again, you're skipping around a lot. Because I agree with him. I remember when all of a sudden it was just, it was a thing overnight that everyone had a Filthy Casual shirt. Like, what, where, where did the fire get lit? Where did, how did it spread? You know what I mean? You, you, you, it comes on Twitch. You do this thing. Okay, cool. You make the shirt. Out sells everything. But when did it become like the phenomenal? About a year ago, streamers saw it, I think. 'Cause Jena was wearing it first. Never heard of her.

We get orders from his fans all the time. And then just more and more streamers kept wearing it. And I get like people messaging me being like, \"I see all these streamers wearing Filthy Casual. What is it?\" And that's when I sort of do my pitch to them. And gotcha. Yeah, it's, it's really the streaming apparel thing that, that sort of made us. What's your pitch? Give me your pitch.

But it's just, it's for people who love video games. That's it. Gotcha. But for some reason, the gym scene's taken to it now. So I don't even know what it is anymore. Well, that's what's alarming about it. What I, what I find alarming about Filthy Casual is that I was wearing the shirt, I think, with Christine's family. And they were like, \"Oh, that's funny.\" And I was like, \"What do you think it means?\" And they applied it to everything they enjoyed. You know what I mean? They're like, \"Well, this thing and this TV show.\" And I'm like, \"It's a gaming reference.\" But it goes to everything. It literally does.

You know all about Coca-Cola. CAA. Yeah. Yes. If Nick was here, was the other, the other. Yeah. Nick's gone though. He's in, coincidentally, is in Central America right now. Wonder why. I wonder why Nick would take that vacation. So I guess then like, you didn't expect it. No, not at all. How hard was it to make the decision to like focus on it? Um, it was actually quite easy because everyone was being really confused by Cherry Sauce and Filthy Casual. Like, I, I came here for Filthy Casual, but you have like weird drawing shirts. Where's the Filthy Casual stuff? And that's sort of when we realized that it made more sense to rebrand for what we're known for at this point. So were.",

Like, are you like trying to, are you racking your brain every night now trying to, how can I put this logo on something new? Where does this logo go? Right. A little bit. Like Darshelle's, watch me. I'll sit there and like draw over the logo and try to figure out some cool way. Like there's a bubblegum one coming up. And like a green Uzi one, which is a reference to, uh, Shadowmoon Valley and WoW for Origins sort of story. Uh, also the Ninja Turtles involving. Yeah, of course. Yeah, see that's the thing.

I was hoping the answer to that question was pizza. Yeah, well, have you seen anyone that hates pizza? No, no, exactly. No, it's genius. Bubble gum's a little more questionable though. People nice aesthetic. All of our shirts are black lately. And people wanted color. So I was like, teal, pink. There you go. You'll see that won't work out. It's true.
