Thank you. You know and love him from Twitter, @YPSHuhei Yoshida. Shawn Layden said Shuhei Yoshida couldn't present at this keynote, and we said to hell with that, we'll bring him. No, we we signed the exclusive is Kinda Funny, right? We did have that exclusive agreement, ladies and gentlemen, the savior of the PlayStation Vita, Gio Corsi. And rounding out this podcast, making his Kinda Funny debut, my friend and brother, Ryan Clements. Yeah, well, this this is like a old podcast Beyond. Never heard of that one. Don't say that. Beyond. You know, I held it together at The Game Awards, didn't cry. You're going to cry. So close already. So many already. Well, I I want to do something before we begin.

I want I want everyone to give Greg a standing ovation for that speech. Yeah, that's thank you. Please sit out. Oh, good. No one left since the Uncharted panel. Yeah, I mean, like that was a special moment for me, obviously, but I mean, the main thing about it for me was getting to speak for you guys. You know what I mean? Like, uh, that that was why I did what I did at The Game Awards was the fact that that was our opportunity to thank them. It's never lost on me that it's not fair that I have 100 whatever thousand Twitter followers, and these people who make these games and do these amazing things don't have that kind of recognition.

So I know it's going to be the shortest podcast we've ever done with the most important things to talk about. But a long time ago, I think it was a couple years ago now, we started PS I Love You XOXO on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames. And when we did in Episode One, Colin took my hand and said a prayer. Now when he did this, he said we needed to say this together at PSX in front of a room full of people and crazy people. And then some fellow best friends over the weeks raised issue saying that they felt like it was putting them in a bad place. It was alienating them a bit. And as you know, that is not what we are about. That is not what Kinda Funny is about. We want you to come here and feel safe and be part of this",

And that's with an awesome animation from I believe Maximum Cortez Tom and Tom Pwus. I don't know. Now do we we need to tell everybody they need to memorize this, right? Memorize. The idea is that we do this, and then at PSX we do it as a giant cult, and everybody's really really terrified. Hail Shuhei, full of grace, Kutaragi is with thee. Blessed art thou among Gamers, and blessed is the fruit of thy Sony Worldwide Studios. Holy Kutaragi, Father of PlayStation, pray for our trophies now and at the hour of the next PSN outage. Amen.

Here's the thing, as you know, Colin and I generally come down, take photos, sign autographs. We did after our PSX panel last year. We did it for 3 and a half hours.
