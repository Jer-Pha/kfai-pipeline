I mean, I mean, it's fair to say that the, the industry does shut down once or twice a year when there's an HIV outbreak or something like that happens. Uh, because HIV is a latent disease. It does take three to six months, I think, to even show up on blood tests. So they shut it all down. You see those stories every once in a while where they're like, no, there's no production now until we figure out who, who has it, you know? Um, in California, you have to wear a condom now on porn. Is that thing right? Yeah, which is not going to be filming them here anymore. Filmed in Florida, what I understand.

Do you feel like it might ruin it for you a little bit though, once you break that, break through that barrier of like being with the person that's the fantasy and then realizing that they're not, they are or are not fantastic? Sure, but I think it could be. But everything though, I was to say, I actually think that's just sex. Like I think sex is fantastic. Love having sex. We all love having sex. But it is not Kinda Funny approved. You remember when you had sex for the first time? Like when you lost your virginity and you're like, I was like, that was fun. The best six seconds of my life.
