Go to KindaFunny.com/Gamescast topic to leave a post that we'll get to at some point in the near future like we're doing right here with our boy Jack says \"Greetings fellas. So as a gamer on an extreme budget I had to save for months to replace my Vita after it was broken rather maliciously I might say. God damn it. Was it a Colin thing? cuz Colin keeps threatening to break mine if I keep talking about Taco Master. Oh my god. I was wondering what your favorite games or gaming experience are that can be had on extreme budget. I'm lucky if I can allocate $10 to $20 to gaming. Oh wow. What about Steam? Can you use Steam or you only have a Vita? Because Steam's great at that. Yeah. I mean I think PC gaming is kind of an easy easy answer there. Um Cheap Ass Gamer. It's a website. Yep. Yep. Yep. And back in my younger years saved me many a dollar. Good. Now I'm I don't know if you guys know this",

Now I'm I don't know if you guys know this about me. like scheming things. I do know that. Yeah I do. And I especially like to scheme to to get the most bang out of my video game buck. And it's you know GameStop is not everyone's GameStop, good lord, is not one of everyone's favorite places necessarily. you got away with it once um with their whole trade in stuff and used games and this and that but it's like if you pay attention to their trade in things and like if you get this like we have a 50% bonus thing you can add it with this and add it with this you can actually game the system pretty well to like have a system going where you buy a new game beat it trade it in buy a new game beat it trade it in and you're really only investing $60 and the one time one time maybe each other time you have to put in five bucks",

So it's like you're saying $10 to $20 maybe like after an investment time that might actually get you to be able to play all the new releases and stuff. Um then obviously there's the you know just digital games and indie games. There's a lot of games that are worth $10 to $20 easily that are just sold for that right? Sales easy answer. If there's a game or developer you like follow them on Twitter and stuff. People give away codes all the time you know? Yeah. Be open to betas. I think you just be really good friends with Greg and Colin too. because they hook me up with their old games sometimes. That's always fun. You've played two games. Balling on a budget.

Remember back in the day you be like \"Okay you buy that I buy this and then we'll switch.\" But talking about like the Steam thing you could borrow their account. You do PSA trading was a thing. Yeah. Yeah. Like you could there's there's ways around all that stuff. Um I like that he's trying to give money to people. No. No for sure. For sure. Save it up and buy PlayStation Plus or Xbox Games with Gold or you go you get new games every month. Yeah I think those are that's a great way to play a lot of games and like kind of just test things out and see what you want to do and stuff. Uh also $10 to $20 though like if that's all you're ever putting into games like you might want to choose a new hobby. Like gaming can",

I'm going to break your goddamn feet. I have to keep talking about this. I'm gonna I'm can't wait to platinum it in line for Star Wars. It's exciting. Yeah I'm start Bastion. Let it in. Yeah buy it right now Kev. Uh I'll give you I don't have my wall but I'll give you $3 afterwards. Glock Guy 196 says \"Hi guys. Review in progress. I've noticed that reviews in progress are pretty common place at IGN. It may have always been like this but I just seem to be noticing it more and more.

Do you think IGN or similar places actually use a review in progress quote unquote to get a feel for how the game is being received to try to ensure they're not so much of an outlier? I'm serious. I'm sorry. No that is insulting. What What reviews in progress at IGN and other outlets and I guess I shouldn't speak like that but review and progress are used for the fact that games aren't as simple to review as they used to be. This is something we were struggling with long for a long time when we were at IGN. Now you see them doing more but it's like the problem is that how can you review a game that is Titanfall how Battlefront any of these things that is it's it's a multiplayer game. You're going to jump in and do this or has a multiplayer mode and you're going to do this and we're going to take you and we're going to put you in a",

You know what I mean? I always talk about Evolve right? I had such a **** blast playing Evolve leading up to Evolve because it was five pimped out computers in a room with me as the monster and Naomi and Marty and all these people over there playing. We were like yelling at each other and talking **** and da da da and you get it home and it's not that experience.

And the amount of times sites in general us as gamers have been burned by here's this game it's a 9.0 it's out and it's **** broken because that in the review event everything was working flawlessly and then we got it out there and 300,000 people tried to play it once and now it's imploded and it's been offline a week. You know what I mean? Right. Now I Yeah I have to imagine that that that's where the intricacy lies right? Is that games no longer are like back in the day it was easy. You got a disc that was it. There's no updates especially when there's a cartridge. Yeah. Yeah it was **** broke. It was broke and you just everyone",

But the problem is they can you can release a game right now that's a seven out of 10 and in 6 months they could release a patch for it that gives it five more points or you know half another point. Um get a 10 out of 10. Jesus Christ this is the best game I've ever made. And so I mean and you know and and that's and it's hard because it calls into it really is uh there's no there's nothing set in stone for it right? There's no there's no set of criteria that you can apply to everything. everything is a case by case basis and everything has to be like and we and I I heard those debates when we were in IGN people were like no I we have to this is like this is the right thing to do but then people were like no but it's going to get",

Yeah. Um so the other part of that though is the the insulting part of do you think that they are looking at what other people are giving it all? No that's I mean I go back to again that's that's like when we want to be and not us when people on the internet want to be really really insulting and really rude about it and like oh just start scheming about what the worst thing in the world people could do and that's what it is.

No. No. I mean no. I mean like that cuz that's just not the job. Like you're talking about a patch. Like no. From when we were working that or when I was reviewing that was not the thing right?

This is a great question. Yeah. Uh I don't use remote play that often because I don't have great experiences with it.

Where you can get through like you don't want to play a Telltale game. I've never because I've never tried but I imagine also it's just you're going to get shorter times to answer your questions and do this. Uh you know when it first came out PlayStation 4 and I was uh I went to visit Snyder's folks in Seattle. I left mine here and was playing Assassin's Creed Black Flag back and forth and it worked. It wasn't perfect but it worked enough for me to do it. So like for me it's always playing something something where I want to grind right? Like when Fallout was here and we were watching football I would sit there and do it and I wouldn't go on main quests but if it was like just clear this area of ghouls or whatever I'd go do that.

Uh Destiny and Fallout both have awesome uh control schemes built in for the Vita which is usually a huge problem but not this because they both use the same guy. Bethesda hired away the Destiny guy to do it for them. And then uh yeah that's where it really comes down to. There's some games that are great within some games that just don't work. And that's the the sad part of it. Like I try to play Volume. I really want Volume on Vita. So I was like \"Oh one football Sunday I was going to like I'll play Volume off of remote play.\" And to crouch you have to hit the back touch and it back touch sucks and it's just No. No thank you.

I enjoy playing online with a loyal group of guys from time to time but one of those guys really doesn't play well with others. He cheats goes against the group quits in the middle of games etc. I really like playing with my buddies but I can't stand playing when he's on. Also everyone else tends to just go along with him but I can't stand it. What should I do? I really like playing with these guys but the one guy ruins the experience for me. Well I mean that answers your question right there. Look you got to be It's I you got to cut this guy out like he's a cancer okay? because he is a cancer. He's a cancer in your group and he's",

He's a cancer in your group and he's killing your positive energy and you let's put it this way. You don't play games to make money unless you're a professional gamer. But for the most part when you go home right what do you why do you play games? Why do you choose to interact with a video game? The answer is because it's fun. Because it's a a because it's a relax a relaxing experience and and it's an escape from your normal everyday life right? So if you go there and there's just an **** there that's ruining this experience for you then you owe it to yourself to talk to your friends and figure out a way to not play with this guy anymore. I'm not saying you got to call the guy up and have a **** intervention and be like \"Dude I'm sorry. You're out.\" But maybe when you're putting the group together leave him off",

He's not a team player. I would tell the rest of the group he sucks in. He's not a team player and he's dragging down your stats. I guarantee he is. Yeah. Whoa dude. That K/D ratio. He is. If you're playing if you're playing anything that that revolves around a team a team effort this guy's **** dragging you guys down cut him out. One day we're going to have to cut Kevin out.
