            "text": "greetings and salutations. Welcome back to Kinda Funny Games. My name is HERE today with my game developer of all time, Keiji Inafune. Thank you for coming today. Before that, I have a present for you. It's a figure that comes with the limited edition of Mighty No. 9, but it hasn't been released yet. I think the game is almost finished and it will be released soon. But what is the current situation like? Can you briefly explain? Well, since it's before the release, I'm feeling excited and my heart is swelling with anticipation. EX finish has been fing CROSS Weintime anders from how how guys with since little up about. Well, there have been quite a few delays up until now, and I think there have been negative comments, but I'd like to know how you feel about the Comcept and the negative comments and how you react to them. Well, I do feel very sorry about the delays, and on the other hand, I do think that we have let down our users' expectations, but we are going to try harder and get it out sooner.",

Well, it has been quite a long time since the announcement and the release is almost here, and I think that everyone, including Rockman fans of course and ordinary players of the game, are quite excited and feeling excited, so how can you answer that? Well, I am very confident about this game, so I can't say that there will be no dissatisfaction when you play it, but personally I am confident that it will definitely not be, and that you will enjoy it, and in terms of volume as well, I am confident that you will get more than your money's worth, so I can't wait for everyone to play it 1stSoweever.",

So we're ever excited that, you know, people are waiting for this game, and very, very confident that once people have this game, play, give, try, see how good it is, and basically we just wait to see people's reaction once they play the game, and I'm not saying 100% people will be happy, and I pray close to that, and I think it's safe to say people get more from this game. One has been playing the Rockman games for quite a long time, and Rockman 3 is my favorite, but you might not like it, but I think this question comes up in a lot of places, so I would like to ask Inafune-san to tell us about the differences and characteristics of this game compared to Rockman. After all, you've been making Mega Man for so many years, so there are parts that are like Mega Man that come out without you even being conscious of it, so I think that's there, but the thing I aimed for that was to be different from",

So, since it's Mega Man and it's an old game, you move slowly, but you have to move fast, including in the air dash, and it's a style where moving fast is cool, so that's the biggest difference. All I can say is that people can get the essence of Mega from this game because you know what's been done, and it's cool to move fast. So, speed from the game, so something we focused on, and this time, the Mighty No. 9 game series hasn't been released yet, but it's the first game, so do you feel like there will be sequels and so on and so forth and you'll be expanding this franchise in the future? Well, if it were a big company, they would be very strict about secrecy and would say",

Well, if it were a big company, they would be very strict about secrecy and would say that you can only say so much about the sequel, but if I had to say, since this is an indie game, of course a sequel is in the plans, and our director has already written a sequel plan and is currently in the process of deciding when and how to create it, so the sequel is already in the works. So, I work is kind of a really answer, but since being company and this is my own, I can tell you that we are already thinking about a sequel to the game, and the director himself is already writing the scripts or gathering some ideas. So, we know when yet, but definitely there will be one question that I asked you many think around us, we talk about Japanese indie words about it, seems like things are better and of innovation more interesting. Well, this is an interview from a long time ago, but Inafune-san said that the current Japanese game industry is",

Well, this is an interview from a long time ago, but Inafune-san said that the current Japanese game industry isn't doing very well, but now that a few years have passed, I think that new games are coming out and a different way of looking at games is emerging. What do you think about that, Inafune-san? Well, personally I feel like they're really defending it, so I think that Japanese people still look at Japanese game creators as not being very good at it. I think that they still need to take on more and more challenges to be able to compete with the world. I mean, it's obvious that anyone can do those things, but it takes a lot of courage to take on new challenges like this. I think that what's lacking in Japanese games right now is challenges. I think that feeling of maybe losing is something that anyone can hope for, but I think it's only when you can hope for the possibility of losing but also",

I think that feeling of maybe losing is something that anyone can hope for, but I think it's only when you can hope for the possibility of losing but also having a big hit that Japanese games will make a comeback, and I don't think we've reached that point yet. Maybe from Japanese indie, from my point of view, I see, yes, there is definitely new challenges happening, but the challenge is not big enough. There are, there are big titles compared before happening, but if if challenging enough, I say 100% yes, because they can't see a level, certain level of success from those with that of changing, hope can something there here the west, we have you, we have mobile games. In my opinion, especially in Japan, mobile games are becoming very strong, and there are many people who compare them to consoles. In Japan and here, I would like to know what the future holds for mobile games, and which one do you want to focus on? In the end, I think that mobile and console games themselves are in completely different directions. It's a battle to take",

It's a battle to take away the player's time, that is, how many hours they spend on mobile games and how many hours they spend on console games. In Japan, it seems to be the mobile side, but if we can make an interesting game, we can take it back. So, if it's a game that can take away that time, I think we can do it in places that are unrelated to consoles and mobile games, so I would like to challenge myself in both. I think that I should focus on how much time I can take away from users on mobile and how much time I can take away from them on consoles, and I try to challenge myself in both, rather than focusing on one or the other. Hard difference mobile or console game is spend on people time, hours people, hours for us. People make a difference in making game, and people like we're talking about your PE in",

People make a difference in making game, and people like we're talking about your PE in. Develop one of the studios most impressed with Japan. The studio you work with is curious. What in the spirit of that studio that really delivers on your vision? Because we got and love games like, well, my favorite game department store is Capcom, which is pretty high up there. But from Inafune-san's perspective, they made Inti Creates' Mega Man, and they also made Mega Man 9 and 10, so if I were to explain their characteristics or the company, it would be like this. The company itself is, how should I put it, but it's weird, but everyone is a Mega Man fan, and it's a company that has people who want to make games like Mega Man, so it's a company where there's no need to explain the thoughts behind Mega Man, so when making a side-scrolling action game like Mega Man, there's no need to explain how to make it",

So, in terms of Comcept, how do you plan to proceed in the future? Up until now, you've played a variety of games, but I've thought about whether to make a sequel or something new, and I want to make new things. Basically, I want to keep making new things, but I'm not just another company, but I might not like the right word, but my family. For example, like Mighty No. 9, I want to",

So, if I had to say, I've been thinking that I won't be like that forever, and I want to continue making the games that I think are good with the ideas that I want to make. All I have, Mr. It is always a pleasure to see you. You are my favorite developer. You are a legend. You are the reason I love video games, and I always say that to you every time I see you. Just I know next time be able to say to you, thank you so much for making games. I got my own Challenge Legacy Collection on 3DS. Super happy about. That book is always fun, and he is a creator I really respect, and I think he is a legendary person, so I think he is the reason why I got into the game industry, and I think I probably say this every time, but I don't know when I'll be next, so every time, I want to say that",
