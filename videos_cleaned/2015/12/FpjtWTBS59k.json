That's a great Miller joined, too clever for me. I'm Colin Moriarty, as you know. I'm joined here by one of my very favorite people in all the land, Christian Phillips, head of Sony San Diego. Thank you for joining me. Thanks for having me. It is hot as hell in here, is it not? It's uh, it's a little warm. Balm me. You're down there, you're down there in San Diego. That you're a little more used to it, I think, than we are up here. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, the humidity here, though, I'm I'm feeling a little Miami right now. Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're you're right. Little more Miami or Atlanta. Yeah, Southeast United States, right? Uh, Christian, I just saw you like last month. We were at the studio. You were kind enough to have us down to see uh, Kill Strain, do a a live stream of that. We did Colin and Greg Live, which was, you know, heinously stupid as",

Yeah, no, things are going really well, coming together really nicely. You know, we've got a great presence here at PlayStation Experience. Um, downstairs, uh, the, you know, here in the convention center, we've got Kill Strain and had five members of of our community show up in full cosplay, uh, walk around down there. We've got Drawn to Death and David Jaffe is down there, um, interacting, rubbing elbows with uh, the fans. And then, of course, we got Guns Up that, you know, Scott Rohde announced on stage today. And happy as I'm refreshing on my phone, the the player counts, people are downloading it, playing it. So we're really excited. Yeah, things are going well.

So the common theme between these games is they're all free-to-play, and this seems to be your charge at San Diego right now. Are and and it seems like you've fully embraced it. How how has that been going for you guys so far in terms of kind of nerves, a little shot about how this is going to work out? Are you confident that this kind of cycle is going to work for you? Well, game development, so I'm always nervous, right? Um, just nervous for different reasons. Um, but yeah, you know, uh, in San Diego, um, you know, I guess it really all flows for me. I'm a bit of a Don Quixote, if you will. I like tilting at crazy windmills. And I decided free-to-play about four years ago. Um, free-to-play was a windmill I wanted to tilt that, you know, it has such a negative connotation in the phrase at times with some people. I think is, you know, unfortunate because there are great games out there. Uh, and I just decided you",

Uh, and I just decided, you know what, why don't we help define what that means in the PlayStation universe? And so I don't know any other way to be than all in, right? So we've got the three titles that are all, yeah, using that business model. But we're not shoehorning it in. It's not a formula where they all have to match and have to be designed and monetized the exact same way. Uh, what we did is what we always do, start off just trying to build great games. And then the business model happens to be free-to-play. That was a question I was asking Scott before in terms of, you kind of have to lead with great games, right? To make this work. You can't just put like a like a shitty game out and be like, well, yeah. So I mean, is that the idea to say like, we really could maybe charge $9.99 for Drawn to Death, but we have to have a game like",

You know, during the keynote, after Scott announced, you know, I was, you know, because I'm a glutton for punishment, I was looking to see what, you know, viewers were commenting. And more than one was like, you know what, just charge $14.99 and get it over with, right? And that's a great thing to see people commenting, because it means that they see that there's a value in that game. Um, so yeah, and you know, this, um, about us just in general at Sony is we're in the craft of making games, you know. Um, wish Greg was here. I wanted to give him a little hug for that that amazing speech that he blew us all away. We didn't none of us knew we were going to do. Yeah, I told him, you won the internet, man. That uh, it was just, it was, he phrased it beautifully. And you know, and that's why that's why",

And you know, and that's why that's why we do this. This is why we work all through Thanksgiving together, get Guns Up ready and and missed out on holiday, you know, with family. Is because we want a great game. It's and if that's not there, then why are we doing it, right? And how is how are you guys kind of measuring success with this particular initiative? Is it is it through obviously, I mean, there's a financial gain of doing it like this. But is it also measured in being making people more comfortable with the idea of free-to-play on PlayStation? Is is is it more to say like, these games are critically great, let's assume, and maybe they don't break even, but we have the form and let's keep going. Is that more the the measurement? Yeah, I mean, you know, definitely on a mission to win hearts and minds, uh, to steal phrases from uh, others. But yeah, you",

But yeah, you know, it's about consumption by the community, like and acceptance by the community in terms of it being a quality title. I'd be thrilled if we had a half million people playing Guns Up and, you know, I'm sure Scott would hate to hear me you say this, but I'm going to say anyway, and they never gave us a dime. They just played the game and they played it religiously and it was a a part of their daily routine. I know it is for me. Guns Up in particular is a game that I chased for four years. I mentioned that when you guys were down visiting with us that, you know, I saw it very early on when it was going to be a very different type of game in terms of depth of gameplay. It was more aimed and tailored to the mobile space. Um, and then working with Valkyrie, we helped them get to the point where what we were",

Um, and then working with Valkyrie, we helped them get to the point where what we were really building was a proper PlayStation 4 title. And one that's going to give people a really rich experience. And we're hoping that that, you know, and it's a learning process for us. So, you know, that's the great thing about this business model is we can keep iterating and we can keep improving. So Guns Up will continually get um, better and better for users and their experience with it. And then what we learn the from the mistakes that we made on Guns Up, because, you know, hey, we're going to make mistakes. Um, it is development for a reason. Um, will benefit uh, Drawn to Death, right? And and Kill Strain that are, you know, further along in the pipeline or further back in the pipeline.

But you already have an identity also with MLB, which is a really extremely talented and I think uh, underrecognized, maybe what, yeah, underrecognized team that cranks this game out nine, 10 months, two years in a row. Key left us out of that category of at least being nominated, right? So people seem to really like have a passion for this game. So what's going on with that team? I mean, we saw a little bit of the game today. Um, but but what what they I'll never forget coming down to Sony San Diego the first time and seeing a mattress in someone's uh, in someone's office, out office, which I was like, this is remarkable. These guys really kill themselves over these games. So what's going on with that team? How are they doing? Uh, they're doing",

So, you know, stay tuned. We've got more stuff coming, more announcements coming about um, The Show 16. Uh, but the team just keeps, you know, cranking out a AAA title. And and the fact that they're able to do it, able to bring new features, able to add polish to existing features, able to, you know, strengthen subsystems within the game, improving it. You know, we know online isn't where, you know, online play isn't where we want it to be yet. And we hear the fans and we continue to work and iterate on it.

And I'm curious again, you guys used to work on an NBA game. Um, is there you guys have sports bonafides. You guys understand baseball at least. And and you can attract talent that might understand basketball or hockey, whatever it would be. Is there a desire to make Sony San Diego, at least this part of the studio, away from the free-to-play kind of more hardcore games, uh, maybe more of a sports club? Are you guys interested in in chasing the NFL license? Do you guys want an NBA license? I mean, is that something you like consider it all? Uh, so consider it all, absolutely. You know, I think it's a, well, I think I know it's it's definitely a topic that that comes up for us every year when we think about what direction",

But I mean, I think I think the landscape of sports games has really changed uh, from the PlayStation days. Cause I think, you know, on PlayStation 2, sports really commanded a much bigger um, presence and share. And there was room for multiple publishers. I think that what we've seen um, then with, you know, the PlayStation 3 generation is shooters took that role and they really to took the forefront. And sports and even racing to some extent kind, you know, were, you know, maybe the number two or three choice when someone was like, okay, what three games do I need to have, right? They go, I need a first person shooter and then a sports and a racing title. And the way things are shaking out",

And the way things are shaking out, I mean, we see that, you know, in the basketball space, NBA 2K is really doing a fantastic job. I mean, my hat off to them, you know, uh, I'm glad that they're focusing on that and not baseball. Um, we own the baseball space. And and I think that there's a real opportunity for us to continue to deliver there. I think I think there's still a lot of room for growth with baseball, helping people understand that there's this amazing product that they can that they can enjoy, that they don't necessarily need to be a diehard baseball fan to really appreciate the hard work and the fun that be had playing The Show. Yeah, I'm I'm uh, I'm always impressed with that team. I don't I don't know, it's just it's so fun to watch them work.

And I know like you said, you're focusing on online, which I think is one of the complaints people have. But uh, you know, congratulations to those guys because I I think they're some of the hardest working guys I've ever seen in the in the industry. Yeah, no, I've I've had the pleasure of uh, and privilege of working with a lot of teams. But that team is an incredibly focused and talented team that really gives blood, sweat, and tears. And to the point you were making, I mean, you know, Chris Cutliff's the director of development for that team.
