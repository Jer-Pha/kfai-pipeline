I'll say Thursday is I would I would like to think that I mean, we're doing something called Private Access 3 right now. So we're still tuning and adjusting the uh, adjusting the hit points and weapons, things like that. So by this time Thursday, people should be probably be able to go on to DrawnToDeath.com and if they've signed up, they should be able to get a code or tweet me. I'll get them in.

Come at me. What's wrong with my predictions? I don't think you guys got any of them right. I mean, uh, no, Geoff Keighley came out and asked five Vita games. So that's a point for it. It was good for Vita. It was good for Vita. I was like, and and there's like free Vita games. I I jumped up when they announced Bastion's out today. I've been waiting. I love Bastion. I don't know what the Nuclear Throne, yeah, rogue-like game or whatever that was free. And then the Bit.Trip is free too. But oh, I love the Bit.Trip.

I'll tell you what happened as I drank the Kool-Aid, cuz you know, I cover PlayStation for years, right? And I I remember going into the February event that was announcing the PlayStation 4. I was getting interviewed by USA Today and they said, what do you think's going to happen or what would you do? And I said, I'll tell you what I think's going to happen, what I would do. But I Sony never does what I say. And they did everything. I I said I'd come out and double down on gamers. I'd make a machine that is easy, make store. And they were right. And then for a while, they were just saying what we were saying. And I was like, we're right on. We're in the we're doing it. We got the Zeitgeist behind us. And then here we are. No name changes.

So I went out with Shannon Studstill last night and I was just kind of like, um, okay, you got to tell me. It's like, you guys are showing God of War, right? She's like, no, we're not. I'm like, you're full of ****. You're just not telling me the truth. That's cool. I'm like, I respect that. That's good. You shouldn't say that cuz it's your secret. I'm not I'm not Sony anymore. She's like, no, we're not. I'm like, so **** are. And they weren't. Like, ****, it was mindboggling. Yeah, that was a prediction a lot of kids had made.

Um, I thought Ni no Kuni looks awesome. **** awesome. I thought um, there was a game called uh, Hob. Yeah, it looked really cool. Um, the Uncharted intro was great.
