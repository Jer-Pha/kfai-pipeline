Come here making Uncharted 4 all big right here doing this. How are you doing? A little tired. I was going to say we're coming up pretty quick on this release date. A little tired. The team's back at the office working very hard wrapping this thing up. Uh, I'm here just to do some of these things and then go back to the office and help out. Yeah, so yeah, did they give you like the side eye that you get to leave and go get out of the work zone? I think they don't even have time to turn their eye sideways. They're just like focused on now. You know, the one and only No Taxation Mr. Moriarty says you're not going to hit that release date. Uh, I hear it. I hear it every time you guys talk about the game and we're going to prove him wrong. That's what I like to hear. See, 'cause I'm with you. I'm on your side. March 18th, March 18th, everybody.

March 18th, March 18th, everybody. PlayStation 4. You might have heard it, but Uncharted 4, um, today we're filming at PSX. This is going up afterwards. You got to put out the giant first look here at Sam meeting Nate for the first time. What was that reaction like to see people freak out for dialogue options? That was, that was awesome. There's like a few spots in the game where we felt dialogue option would give us something interesting. So with Sam talking to Nate about his previous adventure, we're like, oh, this is a cool kind of nod to the fans 'cause you guys always do this arguing about which one's your favorite, which Uncharted is. And like, oh, where would Nate start the story? Which one? Like, let's give the player the option and you could start the story however you want.

And I'm like, hey, there was this old lady that this guy in the internet thought was going to be 450 years old. No, I would start with El Dorado and go from there. Well, we're saying even maybe we should randomize the choices and then track what people pick and then we'll know for sure. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Give the internet more, more flameworthy stuff to come after me for. So I feel it's interesting to finally see Sam and Nate together or their first meeting, I should say, because we've seen them together for so long now.

How, how long has passed there for their relationship? I don't know if we said this, uh, but it's 15 years. It's been 15 years since they've seen each other. So prior to the events of Uncharted 1, okay. Uh, we're now a few years after Uncharted 3. Nate's now in his 40s, dead job, rubber stamping it. And then his brother shows back up into his life. And it's kind of an opportunity for us to get Nate back into the life of adventure, even though he's given that up, uh, as well as get into his past and see that relationship with a brother and find out what, what happened before. And, and I want to, I mean, I have to give you credit. The first time I saw it, saw this, you know, opening cinematic thing, I immediately flipped my script of, 'cause you know me, all I want is Nate and Elena to be happy.

And I was like, immediately, I'm like, oh no, like, get him back out there. This dog still got fight in him. You know what I mean? But my question for that then is, he's settled into this somewhat suburban life. I imagine, you know, Modern Family kind of thing. Is that kind of play into the gameplay? Is him being a little bit older play into the gameplay? Do you have him like Solid Snake-ing back of Metal Gear Solid 4? Or what, what can you say? I'm not trying to get, I'm trying, I'm not trying to nail Geoff Keighley this interview.

Okay, that's all I could say. That's fine. I like that. I don't want it ruined, you know what I mean? Don't ruin it for me. I'm trying to tell me the ending. And that's the thing too, like, I guess for you, what is it like coming into this? I mean, you guys have been working on this game for so long and now you've set, it's on the table. This is it. We're ending Nate's story. This is the end cap to that. Like, I imagine anytime you make a multi-million dollar video game, there's pressure, but now there's got to be so much more, right?

So if you think about it, it's a horrible business decision. Uh, just quit while you're ahead, get out. But what, what is awesome about Sony and how they treat us is they let us like make whatever game we want to make. They like when we, we're working on The Last of Us, we started with making a Jack and Daxter reboot and then we said we, it's not working for us. Can we do something completely new? And they were like, absolutely. Yeah. And likewise with Uncharted, we feel like we really kind of, these characters are real to us. Like when we're writing for, like, you could hear their voices in your head. Uh, it's actually quite easy to get in there. But it felt like it's time to wrap it up.

So then now also, you know, there you put out this trailer here at PSX. Beforehand, we had seen the scene in the debut of Laura Bailey's character Nadine, right? Or Nadine, is it Nadine or Nadine? Nadine. Good. I don't like screwing up names and I do it all the time 'cause I'm stupid. Um, tell me about her. Like, you know what I mean? How does she fit into this? Both Laura as the actress, you know, coming into this like established cast of characters and then now this Nadine character who apparently runs her own army and is crazy. So you've seen some of her presence in the previous demo that we showed Nate fighting this, uh, Army For Hire, if you will. Uh, this, uh, South African security firm. Yeah. Uh, she runs the whole operation. Okay. Her dad used to be a general in the",

Her dad used to be a general in the South African Army, then took a bunch of of his best soldiers and like started this business. Got it. He's died off and now she's taken over. Okay. Uh, and Laura's awesome. You know, Laura, she's come by Kinda Funny once or twice. She's this like, when you see her in person, she's this kind of sweet, gentle, shy. And then when she stepped into that audition and like took on this role, everyone was like, holy, talk about presence. This person had presence and just owned this character. Now something I've noticed, and now, and I understand if it's by the internet, it probably has. I went to journalism school. I have an eye for detail. Laura Bailey, white. No, I know it shocked me too. But this is after lots of research, a lot of this looking at Wikipedia. Nadine, black. Nadine, black. Was this, is that a hard decision to make as a",

Was this, is that a hard decision to make as a company? I mean, because you knew, you, you had have known that there was going to be a headline about that somewhere. We knew there'd be a reaction. Yeah. I, I spent last night reading a 40-page thread on NeoGAF about this. But actually there's some really kind of thoughtful arguments and I, I, we talked a lot about at the office about it. It's like when Laura came in to audition for the role, we didn't have the look of the character. Yeah. Uh, so we put out a biography. We sent out to casting agents. So we knew we wanted a South African woman. It's kind of a badass, has all these dimensions to us. So, you know, we brought in actors that were black, actors that are white, actors that were South African. Yeah. Uh, and really just trying to find the best fits for this character. But more importantly, what we look for",

And 'cause as soon as you have good chemistry, everyone's performance is elevated. Gotcha. And we're going through a bunch of people and they're really good. And then Laura comes in and I haven't worked with Laura in mocap before. It's my first time working with her and just knocks it out of the park. And we're all just again, I told you that that thing about presence. We're just sitting back like, holy, that's, that's Nadine. There's no question about it. And then going back to the office and again, we haven't finalized the look at the character, looking at a bunch of designs and Ashleigh Swidowski, one of our concept, came up with this concept that's very similar to what you see now in the game. And it was like, that's a design that's",

And it was like, that's a design that's awesome. I haven't seen a character like this in the video game. And some people said, but you have a white actress playing a black character. And I said, well, and we talked a lot about this about the history of casting and misrepresentation. And, and, and the thing is like, let's, we're going to start capturing these scenes. At no point is Laura being told, play it black. Yeah. Meanwhile, let's try to nail down the look of the character. I really like this. I think it could work. Let's, and let's get in the game. If it doesn't fit, we'll revert. We'll change out. We'll change the look of the character. And once it was in and we got, I saw an early scene with her and you see the voice and you see the look of the character. And also like, I'm not seeing just the concept art. I'm not seeing animation. I'm not seeing even",

I'm not seeing animation. I'm not seeing even Laura's performance. I see Nadine Ross. I see a character that's dangerous, that's strong, that's sexy, that's vulnerable, that's powerful. And I was like, we can't change anything. This is it. And again, that's, that's what's kind of awesome about our medium is that you don't have to look like a character. If you did, Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson could not play their roles. Troy is not a heavy set 50-year-old Texan. Ashley Johnson is not a for, like in the movie version, they can't play those roles. And they play those roles perfectly. Yeah. And another example, and I feel like I have to bring it up just because of the discussion. And same thing with Uncharted 4, there's another big character that we're not revealing, uh, too much of a spoiler. Nate and Elena's kid that's, uh, you know, being played by a black actor and it's a white",

Nate and Elena's kid that's, uh, you know, being played by a black actor and it's a white character. And again, in there, that was the choice. And I felt like the more we discuss it, the more like there's going to be a negative reaction, which I totally get why people have the feeling that they do. But if we reacted to that, then we're kind of reacting out of fear to something that's outside the game and we wouldn't be making the best choice for the game. Sure, that makes sense. And I, it's one of those things like that was my first reaction to it is like, oh wait, but it wasn't negative. It was like, that's interesting. And they're going to take it on the chin. But then yeah, you talk about it and it's like, I always say like, you know, that's the point of cartoons, of video games, of whatever, where you can go behind the scenes and become something you are not, right?

You could really kind of embody someone completely different than you. And I think on the acting side, it's no different. You, your outward appearance has nothing to do with your performance. Gotcha. All right, you sold me. I, I was going to start, I hope I sold, I hope I sold some of the NeoGAFers as well. We'll see. You know what, NeoGAF, I think a lot of time gets a bad rap. I remember when I first started, I was specifically told not to go. And this is eight years ago, a year, different lifetime. Don't go on NeoGAF. They're going to hate you no matter what, right? And then over the years, as you do, like, oh, everybody likes video games. There are some people that are very reactionary. There's some",

There are some people that are very reactionary. There's some hyperbolic statements, but I also think there's very smart people and very thoughtful people, uh, that just present really good arguments. And I kind of enjoy reading it. So then I guess we've talked a little bit about, you know, this Laura coming in, she is the character. Talked about like the pressure on you to deliver this. What is, I mean, making the last Uncharted mean to you personally? You know what I mean? Like, was that when that, when that torch is passed to you, when you're the guy who's going to be in charge of this with this other guy, Bruce Straley, who I've never heard of? Like, is that like a moment you go home and you sit down, you take like a deep breath? It was interesting because, uh, I don't, well, I kind of speak for Bruce, but him speak for own.

The Last of Us Part II and Vita version, the VR version, the VA version, uh, the PSP version. Oh, whoa, whoa, we're big time in it now. Here we go. And then, you know, we were asked to kind of to step in, um, as, as directors for the project. And it was a shift. Like, you have to like, okay, let's enter this world. Let's enter the world where like, you crank it up to, it's okay to crank it up to 11. Uh, and then really thinking about the character, what this character has meant to us. And like, you know, being there from the inception all the way to, to this point. And like thinking of Nolan North and this like, it's kind of a family of people that brought this franchise together.

And like, I, I told him, I was like, dude, you've changed not only how we do things, I think you've changed the industry. And I, I truly mean that. No, I do too. But I think you guys are a part of that. It's not just him. Yeah. But again, there's like so many amazing people that was just a perfect combination for this thing to come together. Um, and I, I got to give it a props to Amy Hennig as well. Like, you know, that she helped start something amazing. And we're really trying to honor that.

I feel, I remember the first time I saw the first Uncharted when I was going down to LA for some Sony thing. It was a whole bunch of journalists on the bus. And like, Jeremy Dunham and Chris Roper, like, are you're going to take this Uncharted game? I was like, what is it? Like, I'm still fresh. I'm like, what is it? And they're like, oh, you know, did you ever play Jack and Daxter? I'm like, yeah, I love those games. This is their new jungle game. I like, oh, and you jumped in.

And I really do see like, you see what you've done with Naughty Dog, the way The Last of Us is hit, you know, the way, the way we talk about like, I don't know, one of those things where it was, I, I think that is a Renaissance period for what we do and who we are. You know what I mean? I really do feel like what you guys were doing, what Jenova Chen was doing, what the Indie scene was doing, like it was all starting right there and then blowing up and becoming this whole thing. Yeah. I remember like we were transitioning off a Jack and Daxter. I was working on Jack and Daxter PSP when a bunch of people working on, uh, Uncharted Project Big wasn't Uncharted yet, right?

And it seemed like there was just like a combination of us that really wanted to elevate storytelling, really wanted to push character in a way that hasn't been done before. And you know, Uncharted, we're just kind of getting our feet wet with that, starting to just figure out what this thing is. And then with Uncharted 2, we really hit our stride. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's, I mean, yeah, I don't know, it's just crazy. Like, you know, Uncharted 2, everybody always talks about, I talk about it too, don't get me wrong. All right. I know you three guy. Yeah.
