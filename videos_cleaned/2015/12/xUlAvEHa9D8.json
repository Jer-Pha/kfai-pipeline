We've done a spoiler-free review, you should go watch that one until you've seen the movie, then you're allowed to watch this one. I'm one of your host, Greg Miller, alongside the pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. Good to be here with the pure one, Tim Gettys. So excited. I don't know, got it, you got it in you're like, I haven't the Batman v Superman Reacts, just let it out. What is inside of you? My God, like that movie, I I need to decompress on it. You know, Kevin saw it last night, yeah, which is which is upsetting 'cause I didn't get to see it with him and he I was like, stay away from me, I want to talk to you about this, whatever. And I pretty much was like, all right, don't spoil anything at all, give me just a gut, whatever. He's like, I need to decompress. That's all he said. And now I know what he's talking about. There's so much in that movie, so much was done right. And I want to bring attention to one thing, I'll let you",

But I want to bring attention to the first line of the movie, the first spoken line. And when this was said, it **** hit me. It hit me so hard 'cause as I instantly knew this movie is gonna be a masterpiece. And that line was, \"This will begin to make things right.\" Said by someone that we didn't know who it was, some new character. And you hear this and you're just like, J.J. Abrams is on a **** mission and he knows what he's doing. He needs to cross those Prequels out. He needs to set the course forward for what Star Wars is gonna be for the rest of our lives. And he needs to fix all of this. He needs to set this right. And he needs to put us on this path where movies can happen, there's characters we care about and the characters that we",

I mean, I just wrote on Facebook just that I was like, you know, thank you because, you know, J.J. and Disney, because like we said in that war, I guy said to me in the spoiler-free kind of little video we did, like that the Prequels aren't family terrible, they're **** awful. And and they're just bad movies. They're bad Star, they're **** awful Star Wars movies. They don't understand what Star Wars is. The the ironic thing about, you know, there's an argument which I think we watched together maybe some years ago, The People vs. George Lucas, which is a great documentary.

But this was before he sold, like, did he have a right almost to ruin the move late to ruin them so badly for so many people? And there's different arguments. I have my argument actually that he has every right to because these characters are his, right? But you it's clear that he really didn't understand what Star Wars was to the people that loved it. Even after A New Hope, it was it was Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner, those guys that really that really made Empire and Jedi these great movies. And so, you know, that are better than A New Hope, I think. So like he even maybe in the late seventies didn't quite understand Star Wars. He understood that he made these characters and we would not have any of this without him. So I thank him for that. But having him removed has been very good and you",

And I mean, that's the way he sounds. And there's, you know, I know his son was talking about how he had a lot of some regret about, you know, or like, should he have stayed involved? And he gave them the treatments for Episode VII-IX that hero and they just threw it away. And and and not son, yeah. And so I think that it was good to get some new blood in there. And as I said, when movies were announced, I think, you know, these are made by now people that grew up with it. It's not it's not like in this mind share of the people that, you know, kind of formulated in the 70s and early 80s. It's it's a new generation of people like us.

And I think that that's going to be some people's complaints about it is that there is a lot a lot, and especially especially if you are a big Star Wars fan, which we are, there's a lot like, why they show a quick thing of Finn picking up the ball? Yeah, Millennium Falcon. Like like we, you know, that Luke is late, you know? So there's like all of these, it's like little **** like that. And some play guys like that stuff like that just shows like, I think that it I I said in the the spoiler-free video that I think that they treated all the fan service stuff with a lot of respect and it was very well handled compared to the Prequels, which were, here's R2 and here's C-3PO and here's all this stuff.

And every there was a lot of little things like that, like the ball that, yeah, okay, that's fan service for the people that know. But I think that also kind of progressed the plot a bit and gave you a little bit more details about the world because that shows that ball's still in the Millennium Falcon. Like the Millennium Falcon has seen some **** but it still not much has changed, you know? And it's like when in this movie that we had so many questions going into it based on the trailers and so many of them were answered, so many weren't. And I think that every little bit like that where it's like we can kind of fill in one of the things that we still don't know is where is the the First Order and Resistance?

And the more **** like that, the better. And I think they nailed all that stuff. Yeah, I do too. I think, you know, so we were talk about the crawl. I think first of all, the crawl confirmed in the first line what everyone thought the movie was about our life, people at the movies, that Luke Skywalker gone. And and I when I saw that, I was like, yes, like that's what that's why I guys start late. That's why I got so emotional. So I'm like, yes, this is awesome, you know? Like like he's gone, he's disappeared. And no one advantage, yeah, 'cause the line, yeah, and this is spoiler-free review, like I didn't just tear up, like a literal tear like rolled down my face.

We want to know what's Luke been up to, what's Han, Luke, and Leia been up to. And like instead of it being like a weird fan fiction, fan fiction, anyway, Luke not being there, like this is gonna kind of jumping around a bit. But like, I am so happy with how they handled Luke. And I was saying that I hope they don't show him with a lightsaber. And I think that's the biggest complaint of this movie are gonna be that it's too similar to A New Hope, that we don't see Luke with his light, like Luke doing cool things. And that's a find that exactly. I complain up. And and that it's it's J.J. Abrams and whatever and all that. And my thoughts on on all three of those things",

And my thoughts on on all three of those things are, one, we got the perfect amount of Luke. We need to set up this world and they did that so well. Two, the lightsaber thing, if you spoiled everything in one movie, then it's like, what do you have to look forward to? And that's when you get Attack of the Clones, which is just give everyone a **** lightsaber. Yeah, you know, give Grievous four of them at least. Exactly. And then and then with the J.J. Abrams thing, like I personally feel like people are like, this it's not Star Wars. Star Wars is slower and this and that. And so, you know, not to hate on there, I should stop using the angry Commodore voice. Um, but I feel like this is what a modern Star Wars movie needed to feel like. That the pacing was great.

But I think this is better than that. Okay, Hager, no, is the small business has those characters. It has it has a depth to it for me. Yeah, exactly. And that's the reason I think when I was, you know, in the car ride at home thinking about why this one I like this one so much is that I think it was the parts that I liked the most. And the fact that I liked in the Prequels, it's vibrant and there's this cool crazy world you don't know, right? But it was too fake, it was too phony, it was too CG where and I'm just talking about technical specs for some reason then in, you know, Empire, A New Hope, all that stuff, it always looked dated to me because I got into it, you know, I didn't start watching till I'm a teenager or whatever.",

But then, I mean, for honestly, the reason I love this film so much based on what we just saw is the performances. Mhm. You know, I mean, everyone, I mean, I I I'm coming in, I I knew none of these characters really. Now that, you know, I mean, you know, you see people running, you've seen Finn a bunch of times run around. Finn's hilarious, amazing, awesome. His relationship with Poe is awesome. Yeah, Poe is awesome. Rey is great. Is just like this super strong, awesome female character. Adam Driver, who I'm hit or miss on sometimes, I love him, sometimes I hate him in stuff.

Harrison Ford wasn't good. You were right about Harrison Ford, right? And that's **** that is one of the biggest like worries that everyone would have, you know? And I think that they they did a great job with that. The the biggest issue I had in terms of acting and stuff, and I I don't even want to give this too much **** but like, Carrie Fisher was the one to thing where like a couple of her lines, she wasn't Princess Leia, she was Carrie Fisher. And it kind of it took me out of it just because I'm a fan like that. I'm yeah, I think that way.

This is Princess Leia. Yeah, like this is a character that's important. We can't think of the actress and all of this. Not to hit on her either, like she did a damn good job, you know? It's just this isn't the the Princess Leia we saw it from you. Like I'm watching it, right? And I'm watching the movie and it's going. I'm like, man, I really Finn character and I like her and I like these different things. I'm like, I like this.

Yeah, when Finn gives the thumbs-up and BB-8 puffs up a little lighter or BB-8, dude, I killed it. Like, who thought that we'd love a droid again, you know? Yeah, he was he was very likable. I think I think the, I mean, in my mind, I don't know that these characters will ever be Luke, Leia, Han. I don't I don't think that's possible. Okay, like, but they cross-pollinating them and then slowly what's clearly gonna happen is killing them off. And you we'll talk about that in a minute.

Yeah, that yeah, like it's so like she's never she's never been like a top tier after like Harrison Ford is like a **** great actor. I don't think Carrie Fisher was ever a great actress. I like so we might have too much expectation of her. We don't also know what Mark Hamill's of capable of. Mark Hamill, it's not a very good actor either. And critical like, I'm look, yeah, well, you've things that like didn't feel perfectly right to me because like I said, I was totally fine with her. And like I did turn it off, Maggie, right?

Am I am I give my opinion like going back before, you know, to, you know, the 70s, before 77, all the way to the day, unlike these other two, which, you know, Hamill kinda does more like, you know, voice acting in that character shouldn't really, you know, too much. So it's it's although her one-woman show was hilarious. So yeah, I think that they they did capture the essence of it. I do think that it is like I said, a reactionary and safe movie. And I don't know that that's necessarily a bad thing.

And then we literally just see a second more than we saw in the trailers of them like in that flashback thing. It's like, that's **** awesome. I can't wait to hear more about that. And now it's like, oh, there's this Emperor character. Who is it? Who is Snoke? Could it be the Emperor? Because there could be some **** that it is.

But then so then, you know, it started like there is some, you know, and because we want to criticize and be critical of things to when they deserve it, there is too much convenience in the movie, which but like, I think that you like especially how they found the Millennium Falcon at Han. It's all, Mike, this is a little ridiculous. But I'll concede, though, it was really running. And then the the garbage because I got a scripts garbage. And then like, all right, garbage ship.

You have to build tension with this character. This character has to fight, you know, Rey. And and they did that. Like what what's funny about his character to me is that there I think they intentionally made him different than Vader in every way. Vader is cool, calm, and collected.
