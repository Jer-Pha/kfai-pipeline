Is there'd be a bunch of cardboard at the bottom of the slide where the kids would take a little bit of sand, bring it up, and you you'd get up the stairs, everyone's in this like line.

Why are these kids tiny? There's like toddlers doing this. I mean, now is life, right? Like that's why are these tiny? Well, going right to Twitter with that with no contact. You just expected big beautiful kids and you see a tiny but I imagine like they would like when you were playing on this thing, I just always imagine you were like 12. Oh, no. These kids look like they're four and their parents are like, \"This is fine. It's totally fine.\" That's what I'm saying.

Wait, are these pictures that correct is what we're looking at here? Because this looks like Burning Man. This looks like the most dangerous. It looks like a little bit like Thunderdome. Uh this is Golden Gate Park. Uh search for a playground. Yeah, children's playground is what it's called. There is a link for the people at home. You can you can click and you can follow along with this. So in addition to that, there there was the big the big uh uh big wheel thing. Then there was literally just a ramp.

Like it's literally just a launch pad for them to run and just jump off. Break their [\u00a0__\u00a0] knees off. It's like there's no other purpose for it than that. Then there'd just be the classic stumps of of log that just go up at different lengths. Oh, you mean the you mean the [\u00a0__\u00a0] uh uh Christian Bale Batman Begins logs where you have to stand on and people punch you in the stomach and you have to like do push. Exactly.

There's a common theme here and it's death. All right. Then there like there's two more things, two more main attractions to this park that I'll just [\u00a0__\u00a0] never understand. One is what can only be described as what like the remains of a Twisted Metal fight like or or even just like a level in Twisted Metal Black. Like it's a entire play structure that's made of metal bars. So, it's just a bunch of metal bars that look like like kind of like this if they just kind of just extended everywhere and it was just like there's color, you know, the like not the igloo. You're not talking about the igloo, are you? Like the the se the hemisphere like the half circle that's all",

And um it it was made with like um there's a whole bunch of um zip lines where you can like grab a a metal thing and zip from one area to the next. And it's like there's so much danger here. Like none of this made any sense. Oh yeah. And so it's all these damn bars. It's kind of similar to the when you go to like the jungle or uh Chuck-E-Cheese or McDonald's, like the little place, but instead of it being tubes with floors, it's just sticks that you need to like kind of go and if you fall, you're dead. You're [\u00a0__\u00a0] dead. Now, how can we make it more dangerous? The fact that there's homeless people that just sleep in them. Like, that's just what they do. And they",

For the record, I don't think the homeless people sleep in them were part of the design of the playground. That kind of just happens the designers play the game designers place the homeless people three homeless people in it at all times. So So there's all this stuff and it's just like I I remember even being little and thinking it was the coolest thing in the world, but also being frightened. I was like, \"This is scary.\" Cuz there'd be the big kids and the big kids were, you know, I'm an 8-year-old and the 12-year-old who might as well have been 30 is running around and I'm like, \"Fuck, that guy's scared. He's sipping on this goddamn thing.\" And then there's the like the monkey bars. But the monkey bars",

But the monkey bars that are circle rings that move cuz it's like it's like the advanced level ninja show on G4. What's it called? The uh it's American Ninja but also Legends of the Hidden Temple. It's like freaking advanced version. We're like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] But then there's one last thing that please guys look at this link so you can see this cuz I couldn't make this up if I [\u00a0__\u00a0] tried. It's like how could you make the merrygoround if you run around it any more dangerous than it already is? How about you turn it on its side and instead of it going in circles, it's going in like like a mouse wheel. Like a freaking Oh, it's not even just mouse wheel. Like a boat. It like one of the boats. One of those boat rides. Carnival thing. Yeah. So, what's everyone try to do? Let's [\u00a0__\u00a0] flip it. Let's go all the way around. And",

There's a gift there, which is really great. So it's like these kids would get on two sides and then all of a sudden it's like well if we can fit two kids maybe we can fit four kids maybe we can fit six kids and then it became how many people can use all their force to freaking make this thing go and then eventually like no joke this is the one thing I joked about a lot of people dying no one died that I know of I'm sure someone did but homeless guy this was the thing where every single time I went someone got injured bad got wrecked mangled is the best way to put it Like they'd [\u00a0__\u00a0] fly off this [\u00a0__\u00a0] thing into another one of the structures.

When I think you say childhood playground, I immediately jump to Spalding School in unincorporated Glenn Ellen, which is where I grew up. Spalding school was like an abandoned school that was in the that had fields in the back and a playground in the front. And that's where like you'd go sometimes to play, you know what I mean? It was it was like Spalding School was active when like my my parents were kids, right?

It had when you were talking about the concrete slide, Spalding had the metal slide where you're like, \"Let's go play at the park and the sun has been baking this in the Chicago heat.\" You like screaming as you go down if you have anything to go down it. You know what I mean? It's like Jesus. The metal is always the worst, too, because you're like, \"If I'm not sweating, this thing's going to burn me.\" Like, not not burn like heat, but it's going to get that that nice rub. Yeah.

This is when the rubber and tan bark started coming in, but it was those like plastic uh structures. Like all the structures were plastic. So you you if it was hot, you get the burn. If it rained, it was all wet and disgusting. Um you always got burned no matter what. But the worst thing was the freaking static that would build up. So anything you touch is just [\u00a0__\u00a0] shocking you. It's like so it's like the kids would play the [\u00a0__\u00a0] the ground is lava, but you wouldn't even need to cuz it was just everything else is electricity surface sucks.
