Topic number four, I said it, from Patreon.com/KindaFunny comes from Chance Carter. What's something you guys find therapeutic that isn't the norm? Do you watch a certain movie or order/cook a guilty pleasure meal? I, for example, will schedule tattoo appointments when work or social life has got me a little stressed. It's strange, I know, but I find getting tattoos very relaxing and usually leave feeling refreshed. Just wondering what your specific activities are when trying to recharge the old batteries.
