Don't even bring up with you unless you want me to get lost in your eyes right now. I **** loved her. Although that was hilarious. Like about maybe that was my go just to have you lost in my eyes. That's why I came here today. Why are you there? I do feel that the original girlfriend in Back to the Future kinda got the shaft on that one. You actually liked her a lot. Well, you know, that was right. Her mom got sick. Do you know what the harshest thing about that was? I think the harshest thing about that probably from her perspective, no one even noticed. Right? 90% of the people you asked, we noticed that horrible wig Elizabeth Shue was wearing the entire second. Yeah, but nobody knew why. They're just like, oh yeah, Elizabeth Shue, I wonder",

They're just like, oh yeah, Elizabeth Shue, I wonder why she was wearing that wig in the second when she didn't have it in the first one. Nobody remembers this other woman as being worth of Back to the Future at all. To be fair, it was a big print, big upgrade, cuz she was a pretty big star back then. Yeah, she was like either had done or was on her way to doing Adventures in Babysitting, which means put on the map. Had done, he had, remember there is lots of years between 1 and. But imagine being retconned out of your own life. I thought that part was faster. Have you seen this Back in Time: The Documentary? They just talk a little bit about where we're gonna go. Netflix? Yeah, oh, it's on. That's good. It's kind of a fan made documentary, but they interviewed all the people that were major players. Like it's a mega, isn't that cool? Two people, two people retconned",

Two people, two people retconned out of their own careers in that movie. Eric Stoltz and the original girlfriend and the dad and Crispin Glover, everything. But you have to using him against his will. I'll never forget the Blu-rays I have out there and have a different behind-the-scenes documentary that actually goes into the whole thing with Crispin Glover when they're like, well, and he was never in two or three. And I was like, what? Yeah, yeah, he was. And then they go through the whole thing of like, no, they cast this look-alike, sounded like, and hung him upside down so no one would be able to tell. Oh ****, not crazy. But yeah, that whole thing was fascinating. I just loved watching that as that is our youth, that's my childhood of like, that's how all this stuff happened. Right? Was cool.

I'm just seeing the old Stoltz footage. Yeah, the creepiest thing in the world is the scene of Marty and Lorraine on on Lorraine's bed in the beginning of the first back of the Calvin Klein scene. When you watch that scene with Eric Stoltz, there is a weird sexual tension. Like Marty is feeling it too. Like it's strange as hell. And you're like, of course they fired you. Do this. You're wrong. You wanted to **** your mom. You wanted to **** your mom. We just went way edible with this movie. No, be hard though, because it's not Stoltz's fault. That was Eric Stoltz. Like he was that character in the 80s. Like sure, he was not have really known for his comedic genius. Oh, that was just poor casting. You know how much do they film with him before they're almost there? A lot. So the whole they could probably add it together the movie. They'll never do. What if they would",

You to make it onto a video format because I can't imagine like the cut, like the actual cut dailies of those films still exist anymore. I think the reason we've only negative somewhere though. Do you think so? Yeah, at all. They never went, they never did to print for. But I guarantee that they probably have the negative. They probably have some dailies around. I mean, if you see the footage Back in Time, like I've definitely seen some of the footage. Right? I don't know. I don't know. I didn't know what. So they like film the whole thing and then the studio is like, the whole it was a lot. It I want to say was like a month or they do it was like 90 days of shooting. Yes, they did like I want to say",

That's really, that's really fascinating. Which means Christopher Lloyd had to do everything like twice. Yeah, yeah. Oh no, I mean, you have to, you know, you paid if you're an actor, you get paid based on your time that you're there. So it's a, it's a day rate for the most part. What this could be another topic for another day, but it's just, it's just watch documentary. We can all talk about. Yeah, you should. It's **** fascinating. Yeah, I just don't understand why it was the right call. Yeah, what's been such a daring call because it comes off as not the most warm of human beings.

And then you come to the conclusion that it's not the score, which could be easily changed. The editing, which can for all its purposes be easily, all these things are hard, but they can be relatively changed. Totally to a studio hat-in-hand and be like, I know I've shot 75% of this. I need to shoot it all over again. Yeah, all over again. And and then telling your actors that who of our or our family at that point. Mm-hmm.

I mean, I'm sure they were like, oh, well, Michael J. Fox is a huge star and that's awesome. But even that story was hilarious because the reason they wanted him originally, but he couldn't get out of his uh, he couldn't get out of Family Ties. And so he had to shoot the movie at night. So he literally was like a team, I would rat Family Ties and a teamster would come pick me up and take me to the set. And then I would shoot all night and then sleep for like three or four hours or whatever. And you go back to Family Ties. Like I had no idea. I was at a certain point. But but it's an iconic role for I mean, I can't imagine anyone being that crazy in that position. So that is Christmas. Yes",
