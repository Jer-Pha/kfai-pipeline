I was going to say for all intents and purposes, you are Amplitude's number one fan. Oh my God, I love this game. Since they announced the Kickstarter for this, you flipped out, freaked out, you backed it and now here we are, end of December, you're finally getting to play it. Yes, and if you're a backer, you get to play it December 3rd. Oh, coming. And if you're not a backer, January 5th. Not that far. You know all about it. Yeah, yeah, you're here to play too. You've been playing in my living room nonstop, but you're going to show off something new called FreQ Mode. Yes, so Amplitude, one of my favorite games of all time. You just take this away. One of my favorite damn games of all time. Mhm, okay, mhm, mhm. Prequel to it, Frequency. I remember Frequency. There's a key difference between those two games. One of them that Amplitude has a highway of notes.",

Now Frequency had a tunnel. Oh, oh. Now what if I told you, you go on the options here, you go on the options, okay? And if you unlock this, and there it is, FreQ Mode. FreQ Mode. FreQ Mode. Get Freak Nasty. The legend of Freak Nasty. You can turn it on. Okay. And what, what do you think that does, Greg? I'm assuming now the, the Amplitude looks like the Frequency. Exactly. Okay, we got our tunnels back, ladies and gentlemen. This is a big deal. I want to see Frequency Amplitude and then I want to see Amplitude. You a few Frequency frequencies.

Yeah, what'd you do? I started on Intermediate. Oh, come on, Tim. You trying to embarrass? I can't have people making fun of me. NeoGAF exploded for a second there. We're going to Super difficulty. Everyone was drafting their a mean comment on NeoGAF and now they're coming around posting there like, props to Tim, props to Tim. He's there. So Super above Expert.

Uh, R1. So it's L1, R1, and R2. Got you. I was wrong talking. It's okay. Yeah, I know that's why I wasn't going to originally do it or, but here you go. Everything's around you in FreQ Mode.

The internet works in a very specific way. You can't say you are Super Fan of a game that has difficulty settings, walk in and put it on normal. You'll be laughed out of here. Yes, you understand that? I'm not saying I'm the best. I need to make that clear. Oh, no, no, no. Say big fan, big fan. We didn't say you were the best Amplitude player of all time.

And you got to kind of got to keep them going and you train from track to track and you had to keep that combo up. It's all about that. It's all about the speed of transferring over. So when you're in FreQ Mode, you can kind of in Amplitude, you just go left or right on the, um, the highway. Mhm. FreQ Mode allows you to kind of like tunnel around. Sure. So you can't, and as you did at one point, you can jump to when you're coming into one, it looks too difficult. You can jump to another one. Yeah, you can jump to whatever.

I'm worried about your mic getting encompassed with made by Harmonix. And, uh, they're awesome so far. I've been listening. I'm like, I am all about this soundtrack.

See, I, I want people to know out there, this is the fun of Amplitude though.
