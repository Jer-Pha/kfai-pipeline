Good, thank you so much for having me. Oh my God, thank you, Kevin. Will you please clap? Thank you, Kevin. Gene Yang here. Uh, Gene, people might not know this, but you write Superman currently. I do. I do. I started with Issue Number 41, which came out in June of this past year. Hard to believe it's been that long already. It's been kind of crazy, right? It's it's a crazy ride. Yeah, so I I I found out that you write Superman. I found out through friends that you're cool, so no no pressure, no pressure yet. And I found out that you were local, and so once all these things came together, I was like, we have to talk about Superman together. And that's why, and now here you are. You're here for your spare bedroom. Thank you. You know what I mean? It's a castle. We're right here, real bricks right here, all set to do it, ready to go. So here's what I want",

We're right here, real bricks right here, all set to do it, ready to go. So here's what I want to talk to you about, Gene. I have been a Superman fan for a long, long time. I assume you too. Well, I got to be honest, I got to be honest. So the very first comic that I ever bought was a Superman comic, but it was against my will. What I wanted was this Marvel Team-Up that starred Rom the Spaceknight and The Thing, 'cause I thought they were awesome. My mom would not buy that comic for me. She bought me Superman instead, because, you know, parents love Superman. Is your mom still alive? She is still alive. Text her right now and say, no. I'm glad she made that pick for you. Did it click for you right away? It that that book got me into comics. That book was about, it was a it was DC Comics Presents #58, #57, #58, somewhere around there. And it was Superman teaming up with the Atomic Knights. You know who they are? Yes, I do.",

You know who they are? Yes, I do. Knights that ride these giant mutated dogs, kind of awesome. And it was about the it was about like World War III, the atom bomb drops. It was it was mind-blowing. It was a mind-blowing book. I read that when I was in fifth grade. Yeah, I'm that didn't put you on a skewed path. The end of the world, everything else. Everybody was worried about atom bombs back then. So the question, the big question, like my thing I find all time is being a Superman fan is that I'm constantly having to defend him. You know what I mean? And when we do The GameOverGreggy Show, the normal podcast, and it pops up, you know, Colin's over here constantly talking about how great Batman is. And I'm like, I understand, but I want to know from you right now, you know, I'm I want to get into your career, I want to get into your path, Superman.",

And I'm like, I understand, but I want to know from you right now, you know, I'm I want to get into your career, I want to get into your path, Superman. I want to do all these different things, but why does Superman still matter? Superman still matters because he embodies the American uh, story. You know, he he's the ultimate immigrant. And and we're a nation of immigrants. So uh, his his creators were both um, children of Jewish immigrants, and consciously or not, I feel like they really put in themselves into this character. You know, so so would like, I I think a lot of the push back on Superman right now is that he's um, kind of idealized, you know, and he's not realistic. Yeah, yeah, and he's not realistic. He's a little bit people people complain that he's a little bit too perfect. But if you look at his story arc, it really is about a foreigner, an outsider making his way in in our world. So then is that what do you think when you were a kid, did that speak to",

So then is that what do you think when you were a kid, did that speak to you? Like, is that we're all outsider nerd kids when we're growing up? Yeah, absolutely. I I think that was one of the things that drew me to to superheroes in general. Every superhero is a derivative of Superman. Even Batman. Even Batman is a derivative of Superman, right? So so it like Superman, because he's an immigrant, that those pieces of him end up in like Daredevil and Batman and Spider-Man. This this whole idea of negotiating two identities, you know, that's something that an immigrant kid has to do on a daily basis. Like I did that when I was a kid. My my uh, my mom was born in mainland China, my dad in Taiwan. I spoke one language at home, I had one one name at home. I spoke a different language and had a different name at school.

I and that's the thing that's like, I what always fascinates me about Superman is the different things different people will pull from it. You know what I mean? I always talk about the fact, and this never meant to insult anybody, I went to Catholic school for 13 years, right? And to this day, when I do the good thing, I don't think what would Jesus do? I think what would Superman do? Right? Because I'm trying to live up to that ideal. And so when people are, he's a boy scout, he's too boring, all these other things, I'm like, well, that's I'm not going to lie, there's definitely been boring interpretations of Superman, right?

But that is the thing of like, it can get super lazy of like, who's he gonna punch this time? Or what's gonna happen? You know what I mean? But when you get those great stories that are happening, you know, anytime Geoff Johns touches him, right? You talk about like, what's happening internally and who he is. It's Superman stories are always more about who Clark is to me than what is happening to him, if that makes sense. Yeah, that totally makes sense. I I think I think um, I think the fact that there's this Clark and Superman dichotomy makes for real interesting stories, right?

Well, I so okay, I want to talk about what I've enjoyed about you, but mainly what I want to talk about is how did this how did this happen for you? How did they come to you with Superman? Like, and by the way, you get to reveal his identity, and you get to write the conversation he has with Lois and all this different stuff. It was kind of crazy. It was it was a nutty thing. Uh, I uh, I'm not totally sure how it happened. My my agent had lunch or dinner with somebody at DC, and this is what came out of it. Wow. She called me up and she's like, how would you feel about writing for Superman? I was like, I mean, that's not something you can turn down. That's something that makes",

Yeah, 'cause I figured like, that's the one that inspired you, obviously, but that's the one you can't screw up. Yeah, yeah. I mean, and that's also it's also the one that's the hardest, I think, because he's been around the longest out of all the superheroes, because he's been through the most iterations and had the the the most varied history. I think it's just there's I mean, I still feel scared. I feel scared all the time. Why? So now we we catch up. I mean, what's happening in your arc right now? And spoilers, what I already spoiled is the fact, of course, that like, the jig's up. World knows that Clark Kent is Superman. The identity's been sacrificed, done by Lois.

I was just talking about, we like the most fascinating parts of your book for me aren't when he's, you know, out there dealing with horde or whatever. Like, when he's, you know, the guys with their masks and they're doing this and they're putting this through. It's that, you know, especially when he wakes up in Lois's bed, not in a sexual sense, and has to have this conversation about who he is and why he did this and why he's been hiding it from her and how this works. You know what I mean? Like that personal stuff is what I love. Well, thanks. Those are the funnest parts for me to write as well. Uh, I you know, the the this whole idea of him being exposed by Lois was something that we came up as with came up with as a as a Superman team. He's in four different books.

So all four of us as writers created we were asked by DC actually to create this new reality for for him. And so how excuse me. Oh, trust me, this show is not don't worry. You I understand. Yeah, you can do what you can. Burp, you can fart, take off your nobody cares. Kevin, do we care? No, sir. All right, Kevin, you actually don't like burps though, right? I I I'm not a big fan of them. It's weird because Kevin, it depends on how they taste though, don't you think? No, it's just like I burp 17 times a day and every time Kevin gives me the stink eye. Like, you're a guest, you can get away with it. Okay, okay. Also, he knows I but you know that I can't not do it. You know what I mean? What am I'm I going to do? I just ate all this yogurt.

You're not cutting this out. You're fired if you cut any of that out. That was gold right there. Superman gold. So talk to me, yeah, about that then. So like you, your agent comes back, you're going to write Superman. Yes. Is there this caveat that you have to get together with this other group?

And then I I got to meet uh, Peter J. Tomasi and Aaron Kuder, the other two writers who who are part of the Superman team. And and we just got along really well from the very beginning. So from the very beginning, I thought, you know, I've had experience writing my own stuff just in my own little studio, right? And this would be a great way for me to work with and learn from other writers. And that's that's what this experience has been like for me. I feel like I've learned a ton from working closely with them and with my editor. So how closely do you guys work? 'Cause that's always the thing. And like for me, and I think for some comic fans, right?

Like it's always that thing of like, wait, was that happening in Action Comics or was that happening in Superman? You know what I mean? I sit down to recap and do that. Is it is it is there a thing between you guys where you're like, all right, well, his identity is up because of this guy, and I'm sending him out here to fight these guys, but what's he doing in Action Comics? And how is that go? Yeah, we do try to coordinate, and it does get complicated from time to time, right?

I you know, I went through and reread everything just so I was briefed again, because obviously I've already read it. I wouldn't I wouldn't have all this garbage if I was, you know, not into it. But like, you know, I never I had never caught really the fact that on your first issue, on your first panel, it's him on the plane as it takes off. And then in the most recent issue, right?

These artists, they're the ones slowing it down for sure. You just put the words out goes. I don't even want to touch that. Everyone I've ever collaborated.

How long you been doing comics now? How long have I been doing comics? I've been doing comics for almost 20 years now. Like, how long have I been making money at it? That's a different question. How that may be since uh, 2006, I think. Okay, okay. That's when things flipped around for me. That's good. I want to get to that in a second. Keep talking about Superman here or whatever. So you're working with the group. Does DC do they give you a rough bullet point outline of like, these things need to happen for what we're trying to do?

He's well, see, that's the thing is we actually moved him back to his original power set. People think of him as depowered, but originally he couldn't fly. He didn't have X-ray vision or heat vision or anything like that. So we moved him back like like we gave him the S-shield, which I love. That's my favorite Superman uh, symbol. I almost wore it today. Oh, did you? But my problem is that I pit out sometimes in T-shirts, and so I was like, with this light beating down, I mean, that's not a good book. I got I got love.

So we dialed it back. Uh, the the the fact that we put the S-shield on him was our way of kind of saying this is he's back to these powers, you know? Uh, and then uh, and then we we we revealed his identity to the world. Part of the thinking about that is, you know, how how possible would it be to keep a secret identity in the modern world? I love that with with Twitter and with Facebook and with Snowden, everything. Yeah, and that was the whole thing, you know, spoiling parts of the books that you should all go read is the fact that, you know, like when Lois reveals it to the world, it's not a Daily Planet story.

When is it going to be you as a writer have a great 12-issue arc that you want to do with this artist, and you guys do it, and it's put out book by book, and then it's a collection. That's it. So you don't have to work with writers, do those stuff. So seeing huge shakeups like this where it's like, all right, he's depowered back to his original power set, even though he keeps talking about his power has been siphoned off, but no big deal.

He's eventually going to go back to flying. Uh, but what we want to use this period of time that we're in now is to kind of explore what exactly is at the core of Superman.

I read that right before I signed on to do uh, to become the the writer. Oh, trashy book of these books that I'm knocking down right now. I fix them, don't worry. Uh, and and in there, in there, the author um, Glen Weldon argues that um, at the core of Superman, he's just two things. He's a guy who never gives up, and he's a guy who always puts others before himself. Now, there's an argument, I think there's a really cynical argument, especially in the modern world, that the reason why he's able to do that is because he's powerful. You know, Batman Batman's not like that. Batman doesn't Batman's more about vengeance than anything else. Uh, and and maybe so the argument",

When you're the strongest guy in the room, you don't have to give up. When you're the strongest guy in the room, you can afford to put other people above yourself because you know you're going to be okay, right? And what we want to kind of talk about is if he's stripped away of most of his powers, if he's no longer the strongest guy in the room, are those two things going to still stay intact? Gotcha. And they do. They do. Of course. The point that's the point of Superman is of course, it's a great what you're bringing up is a great thing for me.
