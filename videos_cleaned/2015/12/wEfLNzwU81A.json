Already, this title music, glorious, and I am in it to win it. Let's get right in there. As you may know, I'm a big fan of 3D platformers. Everyone was all all up on this when it first came out. I think this is the one that was in the Indie Game: The Movie documentary that was made that I did not watch. Heard good things about that as well. Maybe one day I'll get to that, my backlog of documentaries about indie video games. Okay, okay, I got some drums kind of later. Don't yet, all I would love that. Okay, okay, so far so good. Like the design of that guy. Eye patches are cool, or the monocles, but he's got a Fez, the Greg Miller Fez. My name is Gomez. I go fast. I'm climbing, climbing into the house. It's what I do. What can I find in here? Anything in the fridge? No, no. Alright, I guess that's is what video games are all about, ladies and gentlemen, discovery.",

Let's Gomez time. Am I Gomez, or is he Gomez? There you go. Oh man, what's happening? We're getting shapes. Okay, it's let's Gomez time. Like a kaleidoscope. You got the Infinity Stone. This is cool. It's the Fez. Oh man, what a cosplay. Is him very soon. Keep it locked, Kinda Funny. See me in my Fez cosplay. Pumps be all naked. Lopez on. I like me now. Kevin will be mine, Gomez. Kevin always is my Gomez. Wow, that's kind of cool. Okay, okay, going into Polytron. Hey, why? I'm confused. Okay, but now I have my hat. Interesting, interesting choices made there. Before, I was looking to the world through a limited 2D perspective, but now, now things are different. Now I can switch between 3D perspectives. Alright, so I'm",

Alright, so I'm Gomez. I'm still confused on who Gomez is and who the dude with the eye patches. I'm just gonna pretend that I'm Tim, the other guy's Gomez. Okay, gotta find a cube, eight cube bits. Okay, okay, okay, so this is like a little bit of that Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker. Before Captain Toad was Captain Toad, back when he was just Toad. It wasn't tracking no treasure. We just got with Toadette. What's up, girl? Alright, let's get going. BAM! Got one, nailed it. What's this? Okay, okay, what's up, mister? It's Kevin's house, apparently. Magic. Okay, oh, this worth. There we go, there we go. Hit the wrong button like a damn floozy. Okay, cool, got a key. I'll use that later. Hmm, I don't know how I feel about this mechanic. I'm sure it gets interesting, but the mailbox going into the treehouse, my boy Kevin. That's it. Feel like there's I'm going to do with this. Why?",

The coolest kid in school right now with my little Fez. You looking like, how do you see, Tim? Please close house. Oh yeah, here's what's up. Mm, okay, I was in here before. How do you know I can get up? Trust me, a Sonic. Three down, five to go. Oh cool, interesting. Alright, maybe I wasn't given the mechanic enough run. It, that's kind of cool. A bird's doubt reminds me of the birds in a Yoshi's Island. Okay, oh god, oh god. Well, here we go. That'll be a damn cube square in there. Oh, another key. Let's go in this locked door. And now this week on My Friends Go, got a map. It would treasure map. Probably tells me where the cubes are. Yeah, alrighty then. I'm gonna pretend I know what that means. Meanwhile, cube time. I",

Not quite sure why. Oh, that's cool. I worked better than I thought of it. Little boy, rat-a-tat-tat over there. Oh man, now I got the power, power the cube. Full kind of chump down. Nice, bro. So you can cool, hold down and jump. Loving it, loving it. A little kids, there are the horrors of the world. And at any moment, their Fez could be in trouble. New boy getting there. The door is unsealed. I'm not ready to begin my picture. You better damn well believe it. Well, it's going. Hey, listen, that's not a reference to any video again. My god, oh, this looks too intense.

Go find I'm soon. So the two that I've done already, man, thought that must have went into the design of this game must be ridiculous. I don't want a circle. Hmm, in tutorials, tutorials. This game had me, then kind of lost me, then kind of got me back. Here I am. That's where I'm at right now. You've been on this journey with me, so you know all about it. Okay, been here before. Nomadic other trees. I call this be the last level I do. What could be in here? What? Oh wow, all over the world. Oh God, huh? You forget to use the old shifty makeshift with you, buddy.
