Shuhei, you're, she got you doing good? Good. Filtration, the trends in game up. Yeah, trying to game. Yeah, yeah. I learned everything I, you know, the stage presence, the speech, it was all what I've without you when you get out there. So how hard was it for you not to come on stage at PSX this year? Oh yeah, Shuhei, that you have poster boy for PlayStation. We all wanted you out there. I was so relaxed in the crowd watching. Yeah, you gotta let him go, I guess. Let those new guys get out there. So I'm absolutely Shuhei and they sucked. Now Jeremy, you know, great, you know, come back, you know, I five. Yeah, the Cruiser Dings. Yeah, I like that they made fun of his name before the, yeah, that was a great way to get out and do it. So what I want to know, Shuhei, of course, you're on our panel today, which is already in your time watching this at home, it's already posted.",

What I want to know is what the toughest part of your job? What's the toughest part of running Sony Worldwide Studios? Up this job is not jet lag. You're traveling so much, you're with me family all the time, I imagine. I don't know, after you travel. Oh, every month. Yeah, we equal to, yeah, yeah. So the, well, this year actually, this building new crazy is fun, right? Yeah, for this year actually, I did it for the first time, Dubai. Okay, Hanoi, yeah, and came back to four years after like zero years and Shanghai. And the, so we are doing, you know, PR related things to places far away, right? Because I've been kind of representing the company, yeah, like Gareth Marks and the other guys do.

Yeah, so, so we are our chance to get all these different races and get to meet with consumers in these other regions I do not usually go. Yeah, are they, they are really passionate gamers. Yeah, for them, because there are not many local developers in these regions. These people are so excited to meet his, you know, indie developers, live creator. So it's super fun to be these countries and talk about new stuff and we are, they are very excited. Right, right. So here's the question about VR. Yeah, when is PlayStation VR's big push? Did you hear the shows and I'm always like, remember in areas like, it's gonna be zero minutes. It was like two minutes here. I was like, well, here's we'll sell to all of us like the hardcore gamers and there wasn't a good portion of the presentation of VR, but it wasn't like, here's the launch date, here's a price, here's a big game, you know what I mean?

Yeah, what we said an Eagle Flight. Shout-out to Eagle Flight, that was awesome. We just, thank you. We just started talking about games this past week. Yeah, we focused on tech since last year to this GDC. We introduced with the latest tech. Yeah, you know, super great experience. But, you know, it's only since this E3 you started focusing more on games and every event we go like a TGS or Paris Games Week, yes, yeah, PSX, yeah, announce our new games that will support PSVR forces, whether this time like Rez Infinite, new games and we are now Psychonauts something. Yeah, so do you continue the way the groundwork plan in your asset GDC? I'm putting out, put words in your mouth at GDC is when you come out, you say, here's the price, here is the release date, clear sunny skies, motion 2016 took that.

That's why you stick where, yeah, find out of your way. Yeah, so then here's my question piggybacking off of that a bit. You mentioned, you know, that like you are kind of the face, you're kind of this PR guy. Everyone loves you, they tweet at you, all this different stuff. Like anybody you love to hate me now? That's the thing I was going to ask you, is that one of the hardest parts of the job? Because I know I'm sure we talked about it. I warn you right now, yeah, get ready for the panel because Colin's gonna come loaded for bear. I'm just going to want to know why there weren't more first parties, what Sony's been doing on PlayStation. Is that another really tough part of the job that like now everyone knows they used to be the company for the great stuff, but I'm sure your Twitter is a flood right now and where the name change is, where is Sony bad, where is this?",

Like, is that where you down? It's a tough job, but it's a fun job as well. Yeah, yeah. It's been great to be able to talk directly to people. Yeah, and we get a direct immediately spontaneous response, you know, from people. Whatever we are not, yes, you know, mostly good. But it's disappointing for young people. Yeah, now some people get really angry and send me hate mail. And when I'm dealing with these hatred and other people who are in the same community try to kind of, you know, tell those people that hate speech on the Internet, it doesn't help. Suppose, yeah. So there's some like a self like, you know, mutual support policing share going on. It's, it's great to be part of that conversation. Yeah, but what I don't like, same person tweeting to me again, the game again, as soon as you prepare a point out again, that's.",

No, that would be, that would be a NeoGAF headline. Shuhei Yoshida box score. Actually, no day goes by without me retweeting something you're saying. He's your best friend. He will do you say good things. Thank you. I say bad things too. I don't need to tweet those, but I say it was on saying, I'm fair, unfair. I try to be out there. So yeah, like it's my sadness to be honest. The last couple days was, yeah, because I, I can see some pain of the people who are expecting from system announcement that didn't happen. Yeah, and these people feel, you know, you know, we are not just announcing everything that we are doing. We are not doing the best. Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, so it must mean frustrating and disappointing cause of the passionate people are really passionate. Yeah, right. Oh yeah, no, I know that's the thing is like, I think I always talk about the Internet and hate speech right now is that for me, I think there's a communication breakdown with folks like yourself that are big faces that you have a following. And so what people tweet something mean to you, they assume it rolls off your back because you're so famous, you have all these different things to worry about, you know what I mean? Like you wouldn't get you, but you're a human being. So of course against. But sometimes, well, more often than not, when I respond in the try to those people, you know, are very angry and say nasty things, yeah, they kind of quickly found out exactly how poorly they didn't wouldn't expect me.

Every time somebody's made me and I responded with nine times out of ten, it's like, I'm so sorry, I was having a bad day. I just really want whatever you're talking about. I mean, what does that, does that get in your head leading up to this? Well, it's not even the people were being mean about it, but you see, I don't know, we'll say Colin, he's all excited for PSN name changes and he thinks it's gonna happen. Like, do you start doubting like, all it is, it may be the conference won't be as good as I thought it was gonna be or maybe we should move this around. I thought the PSN name changes as you know, future of your kind of truth. You ever do switch it out that takes some time out of the podcast for school. I shouldn't you.",

You ever do switch it out that takes some time out of the podcast for school. I shouldn't you know, detract from your future show. Yeah, that's one way to put it, Shuhei. Yeah, that's a good way. You're good at this marketing in the spin business. Oh yeah, so I was working outside the PSX. They knew yesterday before the show started and some people noticed me and came to talk to me and you know, can I take a photo kind of thing? Guys like a big smile and taking photo and that guy looked back and asked me, so can I change my PSN PlayStation ID name? And I responded and you know, show some face and the convenience of what Big N told us to kill Shuhei. Yeah, that's true, I guess. But you know how in the show I say, please change it. Say this, you're like saying, track the man down. Like, don't do that. Be nice about it. But we like, I think everybody for the most part is nice. Everybody here at PSX is a nice.",

Everybody here at PSX is a nice easygoing person around food. They're never gonna say mean things your face because they wouldn't ever say that in real life with the Internet, which was already another example when I have fun. You'll notice that you know who shouldn't have it. Yeah, said something like that point-blank. Yeah, I'm the scapegoat for everything bad that happens PlayStation. Yeah, but I am enjoying the people's stories. Yeah, well, why their names are so why, oh, why some people want to change in there? Yeah, they chose the name in the first place, right? So I have like all these people chose their name, you know, they might not want to change. But when people talk about grow in, I grew up and I have, you know, a friend I want to let my name in public, but I couldn't say it, right? Yeah, recently on one of the recent episodes he was.",

So Shuhei, yep, thank you for your time. No, thank you for being on our panel at PSX, which hasn't happened for us yet, but will happen for you. Make sure you chew them. Yeah, again, you don't know what Colin is gonna say. We'll see how fun it is. Check that out of course at youtube.com/kindafunnygames or wherever you got this MP3. Remember, PS I Love You XOXO comes to you each and every Tuesday and we rounded out these last few weeks before the holidays. You need about more of these PS I Love You one-on-one interviews.
