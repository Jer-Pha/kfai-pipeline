Dude, by that point there's going to be the other controller inputs are going to be there. Sure. That's that's what I'm holding on for. Remember when we played Infamous Second Son using our eyes? Yeah, I do remember that actually. That was really weird, wasn't it? Yeah, and that was just a that was just a tech demo he was doing, but it was cool.

Its its next target is Super Nintendo and Genesis. It's like pretty incredible how quickly it's selling. An Atari 2600. Um, and then slowly it's going to be 50, and then 60, and then 70. And then, I mean, this the console is not going to stop. Xbox One and uh PS4 combined are selling 60% better than their predecessors at this point on the market. So um so I do think that it's not going to stop anytime soon. Uh, and I think VR is going to have more hardcore sensibilities.

I mean, like, you know, like so many production companies in Hollywood are already working on VR stuff just because the application beyond gaming are really going to be the thing that makes that thing catch on. I think that gaming is like gaming is broadening, and I think that that the console sales speak to that. Like there's a broader market of people who are like, \"Yeah, spend money on a console.\" But then there's also people who are not paying a dime and they're playing free-to-play stuff and they're playing on their phone.

Very possible I will not. I mean, just because the like the trend on those things is like, you got to put 100 hours into it. Am I going to play another 100 matches of Rocket League? Probably.

Xavier Alonzo says, \"Hey guys, I was wondering what was that special game that made you love a genre that you weren't too fond of? For me, it was Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete on PS1, first JRPG that hooked me till the end. Love the shows, keep up the good work.\" It's a fantastic game. Um, that's a fantastic game, man. Working Designs back in the late 90s was doing work, dude. Like to get some of these games over. And it's right there in the title. Yeah, it it is, you know, Lunar: Silver Star Story and Eternal Blue, whatever. These are games that we never dreamed we were going to get in that in that in that form, especially because of their heritage on Sega system.

I don't play them online, but I like playing single-player shooters a lot. And I have a soft spot for Resistance, uh and uh I have a soft spot for Singularity and and even third-person shooters like Vanquish. And uh I wasn't a shooter guy. I was a role-playing game and an action and a side-scrolling guy when growing up in the late '80s, early '90s, and into the '90s. And uh was a huge into my PS1 was like my my RPG machine.

Um, but I never really got into the strategy stuff at all. And it wasn't until Melee when I found out Marth and Roy were characters from a franchise I didn't even know about. I was like, I like these characters, they're the ones I use. I want to know what game they're from. And I started playing it. I was just like, holy crap, this is a whole type of game I didn't even know existed. And then since then there's, you know, I've played a whole bunch of dabbling Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre and all that stuff, classic games. And uh it's cool. I that genre is so amazing.

Valkyria Chronicles coming to PS4, which is uh which is huge. And that's going to be the next the next big one we get, I think. Uh for me, Advance Wars. I was not a fan of like turn-based strategy like that or whatever, and I just never found a game that clicked for me. I tried different things, and that was a PC thing too for a long, long time. But Advance Wars on DS, man, that was it. Or no, Game Boy. Thank you. Sorry. I think I might have ended up playing again on my DS. Uh Game Boy Advance.

I can't say that it like particularly ignited a lasting passion for RTS, but when I played Comet Crash on PlayStation 3, I got so, so into it. It was this, yeah, it was this like one screen, you know, that you don't scroll around the map. You like you're basically a floating spaceship and you're building structures that automatically generate units that will just automatically stream towards the enemy. So it was like it was part RTS and part uh like it was more like Tower Defense and Tower Offense. So you would build your generators and you would also build your your defensive turrets in a way that would create a maze for the other units to go through. And uh I just got so, so into that game.

I appreciate that you even know that game because a lot of people a lot of people just I knew you would like that one. I love PS I love I love PSN Deep Cuts more than anything in this world. Chrono06 says, \"What are the chances for a Ninja Gaiden Collection, Ninja Gaiden 4 announcement? Thanks and keep up the good work.\" Do you have any insight into this, Colin? No, it's minimal.

People love two, people like two.

Um, and I would I mean, so that's always been Ninja Gaiden's uh hallmark is the difficulty. The first Ninja Gaiden game is really hard. These are really hard games. Um, and I'd love to see them like go back, similar to what Capcom did with Mega Man 9 and 10, and go back and make those games again. Um, to like do something a little simpler, a little cheaper.

But um yeah, I don't I don't think so. I don't you can't count out a a name like that that has some kind of cache in video game history, right? Just because of the fish love for nostalgia that runs through the whole industry. But I do think that they will have to do something like Tomb Raider-esque. Like there'll have to be some kind of rebooting element to it. It'll have to take some kind of modern form that takes, you know, the the challenge and the nimbleness of, you know, Ryu Hayabusa.

Yeah, I think the conundrum is, I mean, it reminds me a little bit of Strider. Um, where they they made that, you know, Capcom put out that that Strider almost 2.5D HD Metroidvania kind of game. And I actually thought it was like really underrated. I thought that game was crap awesome. Um, I think you need to go back to its core and then figure out what made it good to begin with. Um, and then go from there. I'm with you though in the sense that Tecmo doesn't really need to do this because it reminds me a little bit of Valve to a much lesser degree. We talk about Half-Life 3 and like the imperative of doing it. Like there's no reason for them to make that game. They will, but there's no reason for them to actually do it.",

They found money makers even in the Atelier games and stuff like that where it's like, you don't need to take too many risks. This isn't a huge pressure to make a game like Ninja Gaiden and to make it viable. Like they don't really, when you think about it, they don't really make AAA games anymore. Like real, you know, if you don't count Musou games and stuff like that, which I don't I don't I think they're A games, but I don't think Omega Force makes AAA games. Um, you have to wonder the viability of even a studio, a company like that, investing the money because make it to make a proper Ninja Gaiden game that that this person's probably envisioning would cost 30-40 million, maybe.

I think that there is definitely a chance of us getting more because I think that there is like a hole for that type of game that we're not really getting so much on this this generation. Like there's Bloodborne, there's stuff like that, but that's different than way different than the like the Devil May Cries and and those things in like this generation, like the Bayonetta and stuff. And when you're looking at like the PS4 and Xbox One, there's not enough like there isn't too much for those hardcore fans. Sure, I wouldn't be surprised if sometime we saw an announcement. I don't think it'd be a Tomb Raider-esque reboot, but at least like a reboot of the Xbox franchise with Platinum. Sure, but remember to that point, you could be right.

The you know, uh if you look at games um like DMC, like Ninja Theory is not going to do another DMC game. They could have very easily. Didn't sell that well. They re-released Devil May Cry 4 HD. I don't think it did that well. They're exploring games like Darksiders, which is more of a Zelda-esque game, but still a third-person action game. You're right, but I I don't I don't know if it's going to be a Ninja Gaiden game. I wouldn't mind seeing it. I like Ryu Hayabusa or Ryu Londez.

I think it's also had it's got blowback on Sony now because um well, a studio like we talk about Mass Effect, right? There's got to be a Mass Effect Trilogy HD re-released on PS4 for in time for Andromeda. Yet there's no need for that on Xbox One. So does does does EA put in the work to release that only on PlayStation? They're like cutting their audience in half. I think the optics of it is really bad actually.

And like the already HD, so that's why I'm saying the the yeah, I do because Definitive Edition or whatever. But you could get maybe, I mean, if you can get Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3 for $30 combined on Xbox Live, or you can buy them for $60 on Xbox One on a disc like that. I mean, that's going to look bad. But I mean, if there's like added stuff and it's like, you know, the Definitive Edition,",

Yeah, it'll definitely distract some, but I don't think it'll distract a majority. Um, let's see. Let's end on this one. A.
