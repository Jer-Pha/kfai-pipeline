If I did the math right, who the hell knows if that's true, but it'll be the Tuesday at 9 A.M. So heads up if you're watching, and on December 23rd, Sony's like, you know what, we're closing PlayStation down. Sorry, we didn't know. You're not getting any breaking news here. It's just we're doing some Reader Wrap-Up Mail here, 'cause of course, quick episode, we're never going to miss it. What does that mean though, to us? We'll find out.

Hi guys, I was wondering, would you ever play or watch PlayStation VR porn? If VR catches on, it's only a matter of time before Japan shows us what its power can be used for. With great virtual reality comes great virtual responsibility. I would watch. Of course I'd watch. Absolutely. I think that, I mean, honestly, I think one of the practical applications of it is going to be VR porn. So I think that, and I think that's fine. Um, not necessarily maybe PlayStation VR, but VR. I don't think PlayStation VR is going to use for porn, but um, but VR generally, I think is definitely going to be used for porn, and I think that's totally fine. I think that could be",

I think that could be totally hot, you know, depending on what you're into. Yeah, totally. But yeah, it's important if you're, if you, Killian 56, are investing in your PlayStation VR headset just for PlayStation VR porn, I think you're going to be mistaken. Your better bet's Oculus, where anybody's just going to be doing everything, you know what I mean? PlayStation, of course, there's certification, all these different things. Maybe I don't, there's, you, there's no Homebrew for PS4. Somebody's putting up there or whatever. That, that's the problem. Of course, it gets weird because there was, you might think, well, the PSP had porn on UMDs, but that was just printing UMDs and selling UMDs. You didn't have to go in and get it approved by PlayStation, right? John Koller is there rejecting porn, right? I've sent him my porn, and he's just like, no, slapping them",

Yeah, porn pushed Blu-ray, you know, pushes that medium forward. Porn pushed VHS. So it was, it was, uh, yeah, I mean, I think that that's obvious. I mean, I, I don't, I don't think that's a problem. Porn's totally fine. Who cares? Do what you want. Jonathan Barnett writes into KindaFunny.com/psq, just like you can, says, Dear Greg and Colin, actually said Colin and Greg.

This is something you say often on our shows when we talk about it, that this console life cycle is supposedly, you think, is going to be shorter than PS3, which was shorter than PS2. Um, yeah, I think, well, PS3's life cycle really wasn't shorter than PS2's. I think, I think PS3's life cycle, I mean, in terms of its dominance, I think PS3 and Xbox 360 were around too long. I think that is one of the reasons why people were starting to read into, you know, kind of buy into, rather, the fact that like, oh, console gaming is dying and all this kind of stuff.

I'm like, it's because people are tired of these **** consoles, and I think that I just don't know if you can let these things hang around for eight or 10 years again. Like, yeah, there's a principle in, in computing that, you know, computing, like microprocessing, I think becomes, um, uh, twice as fast every 18 months or something like that. And the people, we're not going to be as patient in the future to wait for new technology when they can see what other machines can do. How long do you think we have with PS4? I think PS4 will be sold like through probably 2020 or 2021. But I, I wouldn't be surprised if you got a PS5 in 2019 or 2020. Wow, really? Okay, yeah. Um, maybe even sooner than that. I mean, like, I, I, and these mach years, I guess that's not, and these machines, these PS5s might be, you know, back totally backwards compatible and basically are PS4s.

Like, like half steps towards the next console, I think is a smart move. Um, like N64 kind of did with the RAM expansion and stuff like that. Um, that lets the games, you know, run better or look better or whatever. So I just don't know that, you know, the consoles are selling probably well now. It is important to note that he's not, he's not necessarily right. Consoles aren't selling better than they were last generation. If you remove the Wii, they are.

There are a lot of people who do that, but I think there's just as many who are ready to jump on it, right? The new iPhone comes out, people buy, trade in their iPhone that works pretty fine, you know what I mean? I'm on the every other year, the iPhone. I love doing that.

Which seems so long ago when it wasn't. But even right now, I really feel like is when it's ramping up and there's all these amazing things, right? Like you could, I, early adopters like ourselves bought the PS4, and there were plenty people who kept on PS3 and had a great time and didn't worry about it. And that's the thing, that's how the cycles work, right? Is that by the time the majority is buying the PlayStation 4, there's already been a whole bunch of people who've already had it for a while. It's not like everybody buys it, it launched and is on the board at the same time. Like you keep getting these cycles where you get a lot out of it, but you can get to the next one while it's still out there. And that's where the PS2's 10-year life cycle came into play.

Sure, PS1 cycle was about five years, five and a half years, I think that's a reasonable cycle. Yeah, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't, uh, PS1, by the way, sold 100 million units. So it's not like it hurt. And I think PS4 is probably on its way to sell 100 million as well. PS2 had a longer life cycle and also was in emerging countries and was around for a long time and was manufactured until like a few years ago. So, you know, sold like 150 million units. And PS3 sold about 80 million, being on, on sale about as long. So it, I don't necessarily think it affects interest or sales. I think that it's about like the, the, the relativity of, um, games versus hardware and, and where the industry is at or whatever. I just don't know that the, the video game market's going to, the PS3 that came in your home in 2013 is going to be quite irrelevant by 2020. And I don't know if you can wait",

I think a lot of game developers felt hamstrung and held back by the old hardware. Um, and that'll inevitably happen again as we move forward. PCs get more powerful and you want to make a more, a prettier game. It's going to be a problem. This is going to be a problem that the industry is going to have to confront, you know, soon, I think.

They can definitely, the init, the, the imperative on them is not to sell more, because I don't think they're having a problem with that. The imperative on them is to cut cost and make more money.

So I don't, I don't know like when you compare it to an Xbox One, remember when they showed the Xbox One, I'm like, that thing's gigantic. You know, they had nothing and Brick's not even in it, you know. Um, so can they get this thing smaller? I'm sure they can. And I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure that they will.

Probably, then put into parenthesis, definitely not as much as you guys, but it is without a doubt the best handheld device I've ever used and ever made. However, over the last few months, I have found myself playing it less and less. I really only use it when I am on the go, but as I, but as I have gotten older, I have been doing a lot less gaming outside of my house. I considering parting ways with my Vita and just sticking to home consoles. I have a PSTV, so I, so if I do feel inclined to play a Vita game, I could just use that, assuming the game is compatible.

How was where, how has wearing glasses affected your enjoyment of PlayStation VR, both in comfort and functionality? Every time before PSX, I would take off my glasses, since I don't really need them all that much, and hang them on my thing and use them. But then at PSX, for the Rez demo and RIGS, they gave me the headset. We're like, you can put it on yourself, you're, you're not stupid. And when I did that, I left the glasses on, didn't feel them.

So I'm super excited and stoked about that. Colin, he says, slash Greg, but I'm going to give it to you, Colin. I'm especially excited about VR games that are based around exploration. Think Gone Home, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Robinson: The Journey, et cetera. What genres are you two most intrigued by in terms of VR? I think that the horror game is a great fit as well. Curious what you two think. Best wishes and happy holidays, P. Saker. Um, shooters, I think are going to be really fun in there. It's going to be hard to calibrate using your head as, um, the stick, basically.
