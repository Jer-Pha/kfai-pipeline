I, uh, thank you, thank you. I, it's hard being out of the game that we talked, we talked a lot about vacationing and how it causes probably more anxiety than it's worth.

Yeah, I figured it out. I was talking to my, my girlfriend and she was like, there's something **** up with you guys. When whenever my, 'Oh, how's Nick doing?' your answer is, 'Yeah, he just wants to be back to it stuff.' And when it's like, 'Oh, so we take a week off or whatever, Thanksgiving, and the entire time you just want to go back to doing stuff.' It's like, to you guys, vacation is the work part. And it's like, yeah, that's kind of how knit vacations becoming more and more fun for me as time goes on. Like this year, vacations were actually really good. That's good. Well, we were back at IGN.

I would have probably be okay if I had vacationed with you guys. Having said that, it would not have been a bit, it wouldn't've been a vacation. We would just talk about work the whole time.

Every once in a while, you have to kind of get away and recharge. And that's exactly what happened. I didn't watch any TV. I barely touched my phone. And I ended up reading a lot. A day and a half in, you were checking your Twitter. I made myself arse right. For the most part, I left the phone in the room and I read a lot. And I recharged. And I a little bit, as you guys know, for some stuff we have upcoming. And it was, it was fun. And it really was good to just kind of sit back and recharge.

He came in a massage that with his tongue. No, um, I, that was all normal and fine. He's like, 'Our, do this.' It was, what was really fascinating was I do a lot, I do like a long line. He's like, 'Why, I liked, I like the first part of that. Can we do it, do the second part?' And then he would immediately piece it together right there.

And not, not to jump in, but I think one of my biggest pet peeves is in a game when why did they choose to only record like two lines or three lines and then they start looping and they start looping? It takes you out of it. Yeah, they always do that 'cause they only have so much time. I know you leave some well done time and money. A lot of games that are pay attention that though and you don't notice that stuff. Yeah, you know, which is good. Mm-hmm. But I know not congratulations on that. I think that was really cool.

He's like to see that he's an eccentric, like, you know what that, I mean, the funny thing about it is what you're saying is interesting because Max Landis is convinced that Jesse Eisenberg is just doing impression of him.

I blend the fact that they just said, 'Do Superman 1 again.' And he was like, 'Oh, what land.' Okay, good. That's, that's happening. Um, other than that, there was some awesome moments in the trailer now. Uh, namely like you getting actually see them battle back and forth and knowing that I think they've done a good thing so far as far as the story's concerned with knowing that he's going to not be able to win that fight.

Yeah, basically Batman get his ass handed to him for the most part. Um, but then there's the inclusion of Wonder Woman, which is the big wild card in this whole thing. Is like, how are they going to start integrating all these people with when the Marvel Universe, they had like six movies before they decided to do Avengers. Yeah, give or take. We're just seeing one of them for the first time here. And she's just possibly the trailer. And I'm like, is that really how she's gonna, they're gonna set her up a little bit?

Now, I, here's the thing is, when I was freaking out in the reactions video with Tim and everything else in that night and da da da, did that matter to me? No. Right now, does it matter to me that much? No. Like it would have been cool. Like I, what I was doing is it, have you seen this? I haven't watched it. Reddit did a re-edit of the trailer where they then everybody said it fixed. Have you seen this? You want to see it? Sure.",

Wonder Woman has two scenes. I imagined the party thing we've seen where she's there, we introduced Uriel, this is Diana, why what she's talking about lobby that she must, they don't know her clearly in Wonder Woman fashion yet, and then she shows up in the end to help him fight this thing on the Dawn of Justice.

No, 'cause I mean, I think that you can make a bad trailer and I would think like you took me a while in the first trailer to see gritty. I almost felt that the the tone in the first trailer felt so much more grounded. I I definitely, and I don't I'm not a comic reader.

Yeah, I know, and that's what I have to kind of wrap my head around, right? Is that I don't know, like the problem with that is this, the movie that preceded it is Man of Steel. It's all we have to go off of. A Man of Steel was very much not that. Did you like Man of Steel? I liked Man of Steel. Like I wanted to love it. I wanted it to be the same reaction I had when I watched the trailer 50 **** times.

That wasn't let's let's like there was one or two little nods. So like, let's have a little fun with this, which is like, what does that stand for? He's like, it stands for hope. And wear whatever in the microphone buzzes and things like that. So we have those small little moments, but there's this looks more like a buddy cop film. I mean, I notice I just don't agree because I think Man of Steel did have those moments just overlooking. He spikes a drone in front of the general. He's, look, I'm from Kansas.

There's a funny of other things that are not like super serious and grounded in Man of Steel. Yeah, but there was a tone, right? There was a tone of like, when you think of that movie, do you think of it being more like the animated, like Justice League: The Animated Series, or do you think of it being closer in tone to a sci-fi film? Like, oh no, it is a sci-fi. Right. So this doesn't look, oh my **** god, to spike your phone and get out of here. Who no one needs a text right now. Gets more American than that.

I know what's Avengers mixed with Dark Knight because it is that dark. They're trying to like match that, but they're not doing that. And they know that there's no way they're doing that because it's not grounded in reality. We've known it's not ground reality since Man of Steel. So it's like, all right, we take that, but then gather is the Avengers, Captain America, like, watch your language type jokes and stuff, which it's bad with super cheesy, but it's cheesy and cringy, but it's not that's like the point.

I understand it translate that that level of intensity over to live action because you are at the end of the day dealing with Ben Affleck at a Batsuit, Henry Cavill playing Superman. Like at a certain point you have to just be like, this is probably as far as we can go with this. Even the animated show, like them, there's no animated show no matter what, even the movie, like the DC Animated Movies, like they still have those. I mean, you still know.

If you watch The Dark Knight again, there is an underlying level of tension in that film that slowly raises all the way like getting basically jumps a little time. I see the ****. Do you think that the trailer matches that for Dark Knight? Yes, I have a camera because one thing I think with Zack Snyder, the trailer heat that was first or maybe was just the teaser, the one with like the the cape blowing in the wind and like the butterfly and everything was so like emotionally right. Yeah, Man of Steel. It was like, I don't think that trailer. I mean, maybe it was just try to excite people, but that truly did not match that movie awesome.

That's what, yes, trailer. And that so let me give you let me a little bit of perspective. Some wasn't really know anything on the stuff is what this is. This is because I think I think it because I think frankly is gonna be valuable to maybe not most of our listenership, but most of people going to see this movie. Hey, it doesn't matter what happened any of the comic books or what this is based on or The Animated Series, 'cause no one cares. Like that that's number one. So like that this is this is like one of those things where like the precedents aren't important, just like the precedents that were set say by the Schumacher **** Batman movies weren't important, you know, because no one gave him like that was just their own",

And so you have to like look into like people walking into this movie like my father for instance, who's gonna see it, I'm sure, and it was excited about. He likes watching a lot of movies and he's not a superhero body's gonna go see this and he's not gonna have any of this context. And so that's gonna be the normal person's gonna go see it.

And like I especially like Superman. Like I'm actually really into it. I was telling Greg that we've seen these two shots before from the previous trailer, but that shot of him descending in front of the Capitol Building is **** awesome. That's an awesome **** shot. And the other shot of him like in what looks like Hurricane Katrina or whatever where they be backlit. Yeah, or whatever. I mean, these are amazing shots. Finally the technology can make Superman look the way he's supposed to look, I think. And I have to say, I really like Lex Luthor. Like I think that he's really like super unsettling and **** weird.

I don't know if most Superman fans feel attacks. I don't have a connection to that character, but I will say what I'm super concerned about with the movie and why I think it's I'm gonna see it.

And and that's something that DC needs to get away from because the characters are inherently campy compared to, you know, the more overtly over the top X-Men or Avengers, whatever, with their ****, you know, Captain America with a suit or Wolverine with his claws. That's corny. Like these like these guys are supposed to be a little more like not ground because you're brands like granted, but there are normal people. Mmm. So that seems like there's a dissonance there with like that and especially Wonder Woman who I think like is just corny as hell. Like I'm sorry. Like like that like just corny is all hell.

I think it'd probably be equally corny when you really have these two pretty strong characters represented by really too strong actors and that should be the focus. Batman, an older kind of Batman Affleck is really **** cool in this and Henry Cavill as Superman is totally believable to me. So like I wish that they would just focus on those things. This movie seems to be too dense, you know. All right, the problem is that this movie Dark Knight was a movie. Batman Begins was a movie. This isn't a movie. This is a long trailer. Mm-hmm.

I wish they'd shown less, but I think I wish they would have shown less because I think it's that's the one main knock so many people have an instant. I I like it. Here's what I'll be honest with about it, right? Is that I like so many people being negative about the trailer because I think when the movie's gonna exceed their expectations. Like I still say them. I stand by the fact that the Wonder Woman introduction, it won't be as out of the blue is turn the page. But I mean, like you're gonna see Diana at the ball talking to Bruce because you've already seen that script that screenshot or whatever image I guess they call them in real life.

I that has been teased that we don't know anything about is Jeremy Irons as Alfred talking to Bruce. Yeah, like we have like that one line or it drives men to madness or whatever. I want I'm not worried about the focus of this the way I was worried about Spider-Man 3 when I was watching them like, why are they putting all these people in this movie? What the **** is happening? This one I think it's going to be too little bits of Wonder Woman and that make you go, holy ****, that's awesome.

That's when you leaned over to somebody and say something about it or it's just that he's there and established that he's in this world. And Aquaman's and Wonder Woman that I really think the focus is, you know, people talked about that then they tried to draw back from a little bit and explain is it's a Batman movie that you know it means Superman. We know Superman now. We have to learn who this Bruce Wayne is in this world, who this Batman is in this world. What's going on with the Robin suit? Is it Jared Leto's Joker?
