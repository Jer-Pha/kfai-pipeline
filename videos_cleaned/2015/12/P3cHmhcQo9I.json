Third topic of the day, we get a lot of a lot of questions about this, and I actually personally want to know your guys' thoughts on this: how to professionally review games. Because a lot of people out there, you know, they have their thoughts on how games are reviewed and this or that, and everyone has their own. There's not a right or wrong answer to any of this. It is all just, it's opinion. That's what the point of this is. But you guys professionally reviewed games, right? How did you go about it? What's the difference between how you feel about it versus somewhere like an IGN? How has that changed over the years? How do you review games that are, you know, consistently like online worlds and all that stuff? Like, how has that changed? It's",

Like, how has that changed? It's constantly changing, and that's the problem. Not the problem, but for this question, and why people get so offended about it, I feel like to go back to it, for me, there was a moment in time at IGN where we had been on the 100-point scale, which meant, you know, you're 7.1, you're 7.0, you're 7.5. We moved to the 10-point scale, which meant 7.0, 7.5, 8, so on. And then we decided to, and I say we, IGN decided to move back to the 100-point scale. And I fought valiantly in my own mind to not have that happen. And my problem was, and this is where I think we get down to the problem with video game reviews, is the fact that the 100-point scale to me meant that this was scientific, that this was, there was a rubric that we all did, and you'd sit down and you'd put in these numbers here, there, and you'd come to this score.

You know what I mean? Whereas I always thought, thought the 10-point scale, now known as the ordinal scale, was better because it would be like, this game's a 7.0, this game's a 7.5. And you can then put those into buckets and then argue about why this 75 is better than this 75 or da da da, if that's what you want to do, which is **** weird, but that's what the internet wants to do, right? But for me, when I first started at IGN, and it was 100-point scale, right? I, there's a distinct, I hope I don't **** this up, I don't think I will. There's a distinct sect where, okay, yeah, I reviewed Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, gave it a nine. I reviewed Infamous and gave it a 91. And then I reviewed Arkham Asylum and I think gave it a 90 or a 93. But I think for argument, 90, right? And the way I came to those scores was",

And the way I came to those scores was, I thought these games were amazing, and I think Infamous was a little bit better than Uncharted 1, and Batman was better than both. And so like, that was how I did it. Now that didn't cross over to Erik Brudvig when he was reviewing. He wasn't paying any attention to what I did as far as the points, whatever. Damon Hatfield's on the record as only ever giving zeros or Fives. You, you know what I mean? Like, that was like this thing that you went through and did, and it was just how you came down to it. 'Cause it, I mean, like, of course you talk about like night and day differences where IGN is now, or at least when we left IGN, God only knows what they're doing now, uh, versus where it was when I started. Because I always tell the story of when I first started, wrote my first review, finished it, walked over to Ryan,",

And I was like, do you want to read it? Does it, is there a proof? Is there a copy editor? And he's like, I just put it up. I'm sure you read it. I was like, oh, **** Jesus. Coming out of a newspaper where everything was like, you know, it was like four Gatekeepers before anything even got remotely to the front page. It was like crazy. And IGN not that way anymore, right? Dan Stapleton now in charge of reviews, at least when we, he still is, but when we left that, you know, it went to him. This one happened. So that's the thing is like, I've, we were at IGN long enough to see it change, change, and change. And then by the time Colin and I were getting ready to leave, right?

And then I found myself never referencing the notes. And so I would, I stopped doing that. And so I would review games and sit down and what I would sit there and go, all right, what was the best moment? What was the most important thing? What's the, my takeaway? And then start the review there and go down. You know what I mean? What's the thing, the big thing? What's my big idea about this review? And go from there and tell you that thing.

And it was always like, I get that, but there's 100 other reviews out there right now at embargo that are telling you that. You know what I mean? Like, I'm going to go in this direction and do that. And sometimes it was well received, and sometimes it was Dead Space 2. And that's it was, you know what I mean? And it's this interesting point of, I guess, convergence right now, I feel like, where as we were breaking away and then broke away, right? Like, I think everyone was starting to wrap their head around what a personality was and how this works and what is a critic and how this, you know, da da da. And so now people watch our reviews, right? And like what, when we put something up, like my Metal Gear",

And they're okay with that because they finally understand that they can go elsewhere and do it. And for me, it's just again, the industry and us as fans aging, right? And the fact that now when I got to IGN, right? My examples for reviews were EGM, and there are multiple opinions, IGN, GameSpot, uh, GamePro, and Fun Factor. And like, you know what I mean? It was numbers. Whereas now, so much of it's video that it is opinions. So I think we're in a a better spot. It's evolved to that point. And I think people get it in a way that like, cool, Greg and Colin won't agree about every game, but I know that I'm more in Colin's Camp because he likes X games, X, Y, and Z. But I know I agreed with Greg about action adventure games. So, you know what I mean?",

Sorry. That was great. Colin, I think one of the things that Greg didn't touch on because I think we we have a lot of same opinions on this. I mean, first of all, review scores are **** stupid. I want, I I just want to reiterate that numbering reviews is **** stupid. And I and I don't understand why anyone does it. And I don't understand why anyone would like it or why they would want it. The problem with it is that reviews need to be read through the lens of subjectivity. And when there's no cross-referencing of of um of scales between outlets, the numbers become meaningless. That Metacritic becomes meaningless. What when Giant Bomb gives something three stars, that isn't a six. You know what I mean? Like,",

And so when you like fuse all these numbers together, like, well, blah, blah, blah gave this game a seven, and blah, blah, blah, I gave this game an eight. I'm like, they might might actually feel the guy that gave the game an eight might even **** like the game less than the guy that gave it a seven. You know, like Eurogamer, for instance, is like notorious for really low scores, but their scoring rubric seems to be way more reasonable. When they give a game a six, it doesn't mean they hate it. Yeah. You know what I mean? That's something we always worried about at IGN, right? Or people would be that you weren't, we weren't exploring the scale. You know what I mean? That everything was 75 or above. And yeah, then eventually eight or whatever. And like, I remember when Dan",

And like, I remember when Dan came in, he he's like, I want nines to be harder to obtain. And let's talk about what that means and stuff like that. But yeah, if you gave an IGN a game a five, that didn't mean it's average. It's run-of-the-mill. It like the word was meh. And like for me, that was always the thing. I I didn't like the scores. So I would sit there and go, what did I think of this game? Did I think it was outstanding, amazing, good? You know what I mean? All these different things. But like, yeah, saying a game is meh, it's a five, means, oh my God, it's so close to being bad. You know what I mean? It's like, well, it's also close to being good.

The like the wording is so important and the way people, there's no objective way to review a game because I I always say gameplay is King, and I mean it. I **** mean it. You know what I mean? Unless the unless the unless there's something radically different about a specific game like Journey or uh something like that. The game, the way the game feels to play, that's why we play games. And that's always most important to me. Greg might not agree. In fact, like Greg might look at The Last of Us, which I gave a 10 to because of how it played and its narrative. And Greg might give it a 10 because of his narrative and then its gameplay. And those are two different reviews even though they come came to the same arbitrary number.

So what I'm saying is that I think that some of the impetus has to be put on the outlets, but some of the impetus also has to be put on the desires of the consumer and the reader. Um, and what they want. And we assume that they want scores, but I don't believe that if we trained their minds to think differently in a less reductive way that they wouldn't want to just sit there and have something a little more thoughtful put into these reviews because as numbers, the bottom can't really. So, but that's because that's just what we do. There is no other way to do it. People, I I don't agree that like if we changed it that it would change. Like, I think that, you know, like what we do is changing that and people are coming to us. But take it out of just video games. People like rating anything 1 to 10 or 1 to five or 1 to 100, whatever it is. Like grades even, you know, like you",

Like that's, well, no, I mean, because I think that there's that's different in the sense that it doesn't matter what the other school's doing. You know what I mean? Like that if you get an if an A, a 90 is an A minus at your school, then that matters in your district. And then maybe when you go to college, it might be a little different. But when you're saying like, okay, what's the Metacritic score of a game and the different weights of of outlets or whatever? And then you realize like, you know, when 1UP used to give scores and they would give letter scores, whatever, then they had to be translated the numbers, but they were not, they were not equivalent or symmetrical with the intent behind the number or",

That's that's like what I always say is like, you can't possibly know how a person feels just by boiling it down to a number. And I fought for a long time to get rid of scores when we read out, and it's it was it was a it was a fight that I fought by myself. But it was something that I was like, you know, why why don't we buck the trend and try something a little different here where we can and focus on the content of the review, just like we would focus on the content of the game.

Because they might see while Colin really likes the narrative and that's what I'm really playing for, so I'm going to play The Last of Us. And some people might be like, wow, the multiplayer is really surprising and I didn't realize that. And how is that reflected in the score? I have no **** idea.

Reviews used to be like in in in in gaming press in the 80s, very marketing heavy. Nintendo Power is a great example of that. None of us even knew for years, I mean, it was common knowledge, but as kids, we didn't know Nintendo owned Nintendo Power. I mean, it's like we didn't see the problems with it, right? We didn't see the problems with it. And frankly, I'm not so sure that there were major problems with it, right? Like they didn't, I remember them **** on games all the time. It wasn't like they, but it was, there was definitely a conflict of interest, but we didn't know. And then it kind of like got out out and out. And then you got like The Unofficial magazines, right?

And I remember being like, this is an unofficial, totally unabashed, they can say whatever they want. Yeah. And and that's where we go. And then you got the internet age and all that kind of stuff kind of concurrent to that. And then we've gotten a place where like, there are shitty **** reviews out there for like every game. It's like awful reviews. But there are really great reviews too. I think Jim Sterling is a great reviewer. I think that there are good reviewers at the big outlets.

Maybe that's thrown around a little bit more somewhere else. But this is the problem with reviews and why like the words matter, not the numbers. Because the words mean something. Words have **** definitions. If a game is, you know, runs at 30 frames a second and has a story that lasts 15 hours, well, that's a fact. If a game gets a nine, well, that doesn't mean anything to me. So that's that's kind of where I stand on reviewing. But I do think that it it's both sides, that there are problems with both sides.

So my question going off that to you guys is, did you when you were reviewing games, how would you let other like all of this, all the **** that we just talked about, affect your score? Like, would you think about what GameSpot's giving it? Would you think about anyone else that?

It's like a way for reviewers to talk to each other without, you know, so they can because no one, there's no review, there's no uh walkthroughs. No one knows what the **** going on. Um, so yeah, I I so I would approach a review, you know, you have to be thorough, you have to be fair. Uh, I was always so shocked about um the propensity of some people to not finish a game or not not finish a game because I I reviewed games that I didn't finish if I played for like 40 hours or something like that. I'm like, all right, I'm good. Uh, but like where people",

Uh, but like where people just barely touch a game and then their trophies or their achievements are like, you know, people have gotten called out for that in the past. And that that always shocked me that like, you have to give a game due diligence. You have to be very fair. You have to be very thorough. Um, you also be very fair to yourself though. Amy is a good example. Amy is the lowest score I ever gave a game. I gave it a two. And uh it's one of the worst games, if not the worst game I've ever played in my life. And my review is about how like, I refuse to play anymore of it. Like the review is like, I'm done. Like, I'm not playing this game anymore. It's **** awful. Like, I played it for however many hours. I can't get past this one part because it's not fair. Game, **** game's **** trash. Um, and I said that by the way, in a very",
