You got some excitement? You got some energy? No, I don't got any excitement. No, no energy? I don't got any excitement, but I'm feeling pretty good. You're feeling pretty good. Good enough. I'll deal with that. No excitement. Why no excitement? I don't know. What if I told you the best game on PlayStation Vita has arrived? What is it? Taco Master. All right. You see me playing Taco Master all day? It's not the best game. What's wrong with you? I'll tell you right now. It looks like a fine game. You know Sunflowers? This kicks the shit out of Sunflowers.

PlayStation 4 was the best selling console in the United States for the month of November 2015. Surprising. No. Sony noted that Black Friday sales on of PS4 were quote the strongest in PlayStation history and quote so that conceivably PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 and even Vita and the digital sales were also strong for the month as November 2015 was the PlayStation Store's biggest month of all time. Well, it's unclear how many consoles PS4 push for the month. Microsoft's Aaron Greenberg noted that PS4, Xbox One and you combined for over three million sold in the country. So we can do a little math if we'd like. But I'm not going to. That sucks. Now, I know they announced like what, thirty, thirty one, thirty two million at some point. The console at the end of the year worldwide has to be thirty five plus. You would have to assume. OK. I don't know.",

I don't know. Nonetheless, they won. Now, this goes back to what I was saying earlier in the year. And we started talking about October especially, which was Xbox needs to win two of three months for it to remain what I would say, hyper relevant amongst PS4's domination. Sure. And I don't mean that any fanboy sort of way. It just means that PS4 is really pulling away. So I wanted to see if Xbox One could really keep things tighter in the holidays, which would bode well for it in 2016, even though there's a lot of exclusives coming to PS4 or Xbox One and PS4 actually in 2016. The thing is, is that as we're going to see, number two, Halo didn't sell very well compared historically. Yeah. What Halo numbers usually Tomb Raider didn't even chart. Sucks.

For it's obviously already kind of coming on Gears of War. You know, the the special edition or whatever the remake kind of coming out of the remaster. The games aren't going to get any bigger than Halo. Which is a problem. So back to your point, I mean, if you thought they were going to pull ahead, you would think that they had the one month. October was their month, right? November then was the next battleground. It is Black Friday. It is. This is when parents are buying the system. It is like you're trying to get a deal. Right. This is when you're going out trying to move units, buy units, get something there. And the fact that they didn't get it in November really leaves it a question if it's possible to get in December. Yeah. I mean, what it shows, it shows many things. But I think most predominantly it shows Sony has no exclusives.",

But I think most predominantly it shows Sony has no exclusives. We're going to get into that because someone said something about that at Sony this year. But they didn't need them because they partnered strategically with games that really mattered. And I think that, you know, Battlefront, obviously a big game. Call of Duty, obviously a big game, although it's sold better on Xbox as we're going to get into in a minute. Are we counting bundles in it? We don't know. Well, we don't count them, but we don't know if that makes a difference. I can't imagine anyone bought that hideous PS4 bundle. A lot of people did. I'm sure they did. Ugly fucking console. Paint it.

Just put it away. Just play it and it's fine. But they bought, you know, the Call of Duty bundle and the Battlefront bundle and the Uncharted bundle for the collection. And Uncharted is obviously an exclusive, but not the Uncharted we're waiting for. But it didn't really matter. So I'm wondering, and it didn't matter in the wake really of Halo of all games, really their biggest of all guns at Microsoft Halo. Or so we think. I've said and long said that Halo is on the wane. And you thought Gears was on the F-swing. Yeah, and I think Gears is waxing. Because Gears looks awesome. And I also think Gears is just more ripe for storytelling. In my experience",

That's what we're talking about on a Gamescast that'll go live soon, right? For me, Halo just as a franchise doesn't click. And this was the Halo where I was just like, you know what? It's me. It's not them. A lot of people love this game. For me, it's just not a thing. Gears, I enjoy playing. I look forward to playing Gears. Yeah. So I think that next year will be good for Microsoft.

I still want to reiterate that Xbox One, even though they don't release numbers anymore, seems to be a parody if not actually doing better than Xbox 360 at this point in its life cycle. But I don't know. And I also said, as we said on Colin and Greg Live, I don't know that there are many fronts that they can win on now because the United States is the most meaningful of all economic fronts for lots of electronics, including Xbox and PlayStation. And here they can fight. But they're getting trounced in Japan, although it's not a very important market anymore. I was going to say, Japan's not doing well for PlayStation.

And I don't know if it's ever going to come out. I wasn't surprised that PS4 won the month, but I am interested to see how December now shakes out. Xbox One is very appropriately priced. There's some interesting bundles. They have a Fallout bundle. There's a Tomb Raider bundle, Portroom Raider. Let's get into that. Rest in peace. Number two, in addition to hardware success, PlayStation four also saw significant success at retail in the United States for the month of November in terms of software.

Guardians, Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Just Dance 2016 with the exception of Halo five, which is an Xbox one exclusive, Just Dance 2016, which sold best on Wii and Wii U and Call of Duty Black Ops three, which sold best on Xbox one. All games sold best on PlayStation four. So when we're talking about what games are, I'm not talking about Fallout four, even though Xbox had a bundle and even though Xbox had the strategic partnership with them, Star Wars, Battlefront, obviously it's not a surprise. Madden, NFL 16, NBA, K 16, FIFA 16, Need for Speed, Assassin's Creed.

So how well did the bundle sell for PS4 to get Black Ops three? I don't know. I still don't know if it really would have mattered. I do feel like this is a slow moving machine to get Call of Duty players over to PlayStation. It's not going to happen overnight. People play Xbox or people that play Call of Duty play on Xbox. And that's not going to be like, that's going to be a glacial shift. I think it's a smart movement for them. I don't know. It's working. I do see, you know, I mean, like I just think it's a great example. Like, like she really does love Call of Duty and she'll text me every so often and it'll be a photo of her playing with her.

Just Dance charted 10th, sold best on Wii, sold best on Wii. Not surprising, man. Like that's where that thing thrives. That's where that lives. I don't understand who is still using it, but the audience that would care about Just Dance is still using the tune of several hundred thousand at least sold cumulatively across all platforms. So, I mean, the people who saw that we plugged in, they're still playing it. Yeah.

That if the bundles helped with Xbox One, then it's possible that there were just more Xbox One copies out there. But the bundles, again, aren't counted. So that goes certainly both ways. Sure. My point's done. My point was going to be that for Assassin's Creed and Madden, right, I think those are different beasts. Those are the kind of franchises that twist in the wind and go wherever the majority is, right? Well, they're very casual. I don't want to say casual, but they are more casual. Yeah, exactly.

Xbox players are into Call of Duty. Call of Duty players who are on Xbox or on PlayStation are going to continue on those trajectories, right?

I mean, I'm going to play it high to them, right? Madden's Madden, no matter where you play Madden. Right. No, I agree.

They reuse a lot of the same assets and there are a lot of empty lands. Novigrad is the biggest city in Witcher 3 but Novigrad is small when you compare it to Midgar. Both in size and detail.

Three, Vice City, San Andreas, four, five in that order, and see where they've been. If you can crunch those into like... Three, Vice City and San Andreas aren't that big. Especially three, Vice City. San Andreas is big. I think it would be cool to see, like, start from the beginning. I want to go back and play three, because I haven't",

It was the freedom and the gameplay and the world of GTA but we were voiced and we were voiced by Ray Liotta. And it was colorful and Phil Collins is in it and the soundtrack was unbelievable. And then San Andreas was that step that some people thought maybe was a step too far. But really what it was was them Rockstar tipping their hat to what was coming.

And console manufacturers will have more control over that than PC. Of course, Steam will let you do whatever the fuck you want, I guess. So I don't think things have changed. Have we come a long way since Castle Crashers and Shadow Complex and Flower and all the Flower's Technic? I know what you meant.

Not that it's a $15 game it was also free. But the point is is that Rocket League did like eight or nine million. That's not a fucking trivial amount of copies. Call of Duty Battlefront's expected to do 14. So put that into context. You have any idea how much money they spent on that fucking game? And the server costs and all that. Rocket League was a dollar for dollar pound for pound. We have to have Jeremy out and talk business with him because I'm sure he would.

While we talk about this indie stuff it's probably a good way to transition and make a Greg way to this week's forgotten PlayStation game. This one is different, Colin. We've talked about this before forgotten PlayStation game. Usually we jump back calling out cars we grab something from a ways back. What I want to talk about is Actual Sunlight which is something I played this year and talked to you about recently on the Gamescast.

And then I've talked about it on a I put it in my it's already on I'm doing a couple of game of the year articles for sister publications. They're popping up all over these places.

So I was playing some Destiny and messing around with Bungie's new Sparrow League racing. These races can be frustrating at times with questionable physics and bumper car mechanics that are happening. However, I was having some fun killing time until a party. Probably going to a party with Mike Jr. 5. These other party animals. I get into one race and right off the bat it is neck and neck between me and this one other player. It was then I took a closer look at his name and we jostled for as we jostled for first. It was none other than CausticAjaculate. CausticAjaculate. I fell behind in the race and only caught up to him at the end. But all throughout the race I see CausticAjaculate in the lead. Unfortunately, there was no come pun intended from behind victory.
