As always, I'm Tim Gettys, joined by the coolest dudes in video games, Colin Moriarty and Greg Miller. Hello, Tim. I like that you kept that for a while. That's what I do, Tim. Face, I commit. Face, I committed to converse, committed to being fat, committed to glasses. Okay, DC Comics, PlayStation. Yep. Not committed to Kevin. If you want to get rid of Kevin at any second, at any moment, yeah, he's having one of those days. Yeah, right before we went live, you said, you're having one of those days, you need to shut the **** up. I mean, it's just, it's, I'm allowed to say that out of love, but Kevin, it's like, it's not so much that he talks too much, it's, it's that he's not quiet.",

It's a huge problem with Kevin. Yeah, yeah, but I love him. That's not nice. Don't give me a finger, Kevin. Kevin, don't flip people off, Kevin. You're better than that.

Haven't seen hide nor hair of that there. I'm telling you, man, Amazon, I love them to death. They're one of my favorite things in the world, but just two, they're slipping on that. They're slipping.

It does smell like McDonald's coffee. I'm loving it for sure. Um, was there more uh rigmarole to go through? And yeah, .com store. There's t-shirts and stuff. Those are cool. Um, there's mugs and other things. If you're listening to this Friday night as a patron, come see us at PSX tomorrow, Saturday. If it's Monday, you missed it, but hopefully it's up. Hopefully we'll have recaps. We will have recaps, I'm sure. Mhm. Um, are we gonna post the, are we recording the panel? That would be the plan. Okay, cool.

Yeah, we should, we should look into that because I would like to have that for our records. I've been saying we're going to have it to everybody. I've been lying to everyone's face as if this is all set. But then I looked at Kevin and I said, and Kevin, go from there because we're hoping to do some interviews. Go from there to record the panel. And Kevin looked back at me and when I saw his eye, I realized this is tougher than just saying that's going to happen.

I didn't want to jump right into what, what was, what was the gun? Battlefront, right? I was playing Battlefront, right? No, ****, that's today's topic actually, that published today. You playing the storm **** game? Uh, so I was playing that as a hold over 'cause I didn't want to get into anything, right?

Uh Tomb Raider and Syndicate we had, but I didn't want to dive into and get started and then just go away again. So went away, played a whole bunch of stuff on Vita on the flight. Shocking, I know. Played through the Flower. You ever, you heard of this Flower game? Flower's on. You ever heard of Flower? You played it on V? Yes, yes, on V. Is it motion or is it just uh, it's motion. Yeah, there's, you can, it's, yes, you can. I'm trying to remember. It's motion, but there's a secondary system, but it's not intuitive. It's not normal.

I was like, oh good, I don't have to use the motion. And because I want to be this guy in the plane seat. Yeah, it's weird. And then it was still like motion's the way to go. Also played um, what'd you think of Flow? I've played Flower before. This is like my first time in a long time sitting down and like play. I'm gonna go through every one of the Flower worlds or whatever. It was fun. It's still the same thing of just like, I wish it was a little bit more precise. You know, I know it's supposed to be relaxing. I, you know, I mean, I was working when Flower came out. Obviously, I covered Flower from the Genesis from being a seed.

But it was one of those things where I was like looking at the trophies like, and then I was like, nah, you know what? I don't want to do this one. And I want to, I got to look it up because I played a game that I hadn't even, I didn't even know was out on uh, it slip, slip under my radar in terms of it now. And so now we got to, what have you been playing, Colin, what? I look this up. Nothing. Okay, damn. I thought that would more time. You had a very un-Colin, but also very Colin Thanksgiving break.

Then I started playing it and realized I didn't really like the control scheme, so I kind of have to get over that. And I don't know, I'm just in one of those positions, I think all gamers find themselves in every once in a while, which is I just don't, I just, there's just nothing out there that I really like that's really, really driving me to play. So, um, I've just been like watching TV and reading books and trying to socialize with friends or doing whatever, you know, other things that are, that are out there. But I'll get back into it.

When you try to, I've done it, you've done it, we've done it. When you try to force yourself to game, oh, I have to play this for review or to be able to talk about it or whatever. And it's not the way to go. The game I was trying to say is I played Actual Sunlight. Have you heard of Actual Sunlight? No, it's one of those. I, I like to jump into the Vita store every so often, dig around, try to find something when I'm going on a trip. Found Actual Sunlight, hadn't heard of it. And it's a game all about killing yourself. It's a, it's a super depressing look at being depressed and what this is. And it's, it kind of is.

Like you come out of your apartment one day all depressed and it's like little 8-bit sprites or whatever moving around, maybe 16-bit. It's, it's little guy. You know what I mean? Like, look, they look, remind me if you remember, of course, the bigheaded Ghostbusters game on a Game Boy. That's what we're dealing with. Uh, but you come out and there's two like, you're, you walk around, you interact with things, but like, you know, even if you say hi to the person at the coffee shop, you click on it, then you get like, you know, what's happening in his head and stuff and how depressed he is and how **** up his life is.

This isn't your life. This is this guy in his late 30s who's depressed. You like, it's all these really heavy themes, heavy, heavy themes in this interesting thing you're going through and having. It's, I guess it's weird because you're moving around and interacting with objects and stuff, but it's really all told through text. You just get there and it's like, it's all this text and it's not just like a conversation every time. It's like you're getting, you're reading a story about how depressed this person was.

I don't, it sounds weird to say it was interesting because this is like something real people struggle with this deep kind of depression on this level and they actually go and take this side out. And so it's interesting to play through it and feel those emotions as that character, but not obviously on the same level. You know what I mean? But it was a fun character experience of going through and playing and feel like, you know, know when you meet people who are depressed or people who are a bit more inward stuff to have a look at what that's like. You know what I mean? 'Cause we've all been depressed. I've never been depressed on that level, of course. Yeah. Uh, but it was interesting. It was a good case study. Interesting.

Uh, then I got to Chicago and still was like, I want something to get lost in. Like, you know what I mean? This is where I keep talking about like, uh, I'd love a Western RPG. I just came off Fallout, right? But I would love just a Western RPG on Vita where I'm just going around taking quests and doing this. And so I was toying around and finally I looked, I was, you know, I did the the Google of like, best RPGs on Vita. Like, tell me what RPGs are on Vita that I haven't reviewed or aren't from my time period or whatever kind of thing. You know what I mean? There's obviously everybody's Persona. I'm like, well, yeah, I've been saying Persona for a long time too. But then eventually when I was going through Chrono Trigger popped up.",

And I've never played Chrono Trigger being a dumb Sega kid or whatever. And I was like, okay, cool. So I got that, jumped in. Not at all deep into it. Maybe an hour, hour and a half. You know, I got the Frog. We're going to just open the or pretty stoked about it. What's on the other side? But I'm enjoying it. You know what I mean? And that was the thing of like, I think I might be just in that mindset where that's going to scratch the itch the way it's supposed to. Because if you remember in the leadup to Grandia, not Grandia, I apologize. Um, Suikoden, right? Uh, coming out on Vita. Jared Petty was hyping me up for everything he said sounded so great.

So I'm looking forward to that as my game on the go. That's exciting. I'm excited to hear what you have to say about it at the end. Good game. Don't spoil for me. I won't. I assume I time travel again. I'm not, I can't, I can't be trapped this far in the past. I'm gonna get out of the, I'm gonna get out of the past for sure. You know what I'm saying?

And like it, we just keep trading off like matches, just playing. I'm like, this, oh, you're not doing like split screen together? No, we tried. And I mean, it's cool, but it's you with the game like this where it is so much about the, the graphics and like the look and the feel and stuff. Like having it one screen really is nice. Gotcha. So we're just trading off on that. Um, the, the biggest thing though, is I tried playing The Walking Dead Telltale Games for the first time.

So I didn't want to touch the controller at all. Just have her do it. Um, 'cause she never plays games, never played a game ever. And except for like mobile ****. And oh my God, that experience.

Like, ****, I hate this guy, but what do I do? What do I say? Yeah, it's, it's cool though. But I've been really enjoying that. Um, and then I dabbled in the Rise of the Tomb Raider. Ah, which is what this topic is about actually. Well, I'm not done. Yeah, I came back from Chicago in mid-escapades. Played Rise of the Tomb Raider. Beat Rise of the Tomb Raider last night. Then I jumped into Just Cause 3. Played some of that. And then, or actually reversed those in this order. Not that it all matters to you. Uh, we jumped in and did.",

And I was also ready just to chill out and be left alone. Not that I didn't enjoy home, but you know, you got to talk to people. Yeah, but so like Saturday and Sunday, pretty much played Rise of the Tomb Raider as much as I wanted to. Beat it last night. And then I was like, cool, now I can get Just Cause 3 in so I can have something to talk about today. Just Cause 3 did that normal **** where you put it in, it's like, I'm, I'm loading it up.

I hate when you have the platinum trophy, but then they add the DLC and it drops like, now you have 76%, but you have the platinum. That can't stand. No, uh-uh. Yeah, damn, that's some shady ****. Definitely good movie. Get me go back. Except for DC Universe Online where I have like the platinum in 15% of the trophies because they've added so many goddamn rare trophies. Fun.
