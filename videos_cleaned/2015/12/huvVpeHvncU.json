That's Colin Moriarty. That's Tim Gettys. And they finally lived their dreams of seeing a new Star Wars film spoiler-free. Did you enjoy it, Colin? Yeah, it was. I thought it was a great movie. Formulaic and safe, sure, but but I think a a great movie, a great movie. And the first real Star Wars movie we've gotten since 1983, which is nice, 'cause it's it's it's one of those things where I think Tim will well, maybe maybe Tim will agree or he won't, but the the Prequels are unfathomably bad. Like, I and and really like sucked everything out of me in terms of like liking Star Wars. By the time Episode III came, I was like, I can't **** stand this **** anymore. Yeah, and this made me, you know, I I loved Star Wars as a kid and really it was like one of my favorite IP, um, property. And uh, I I just just oh, the Prequels are **** terrible and they beat it out of",

And people could watch old conversations with Colin about kind of my my Star Wars is Undead. Um, and so yeah, I think that it was I think it was great. I don't think it was excellent. I don't think it was good, though. I think it was a a great movie and sets everything up very nicely. Yeah. Oh man, I agree completely. My review of this movie is simple. Throughout the entire thing, I there was very few moments that my feelings inside were just **** yeah, **** yeah, **** yeah, **** yeah, over and over and over and over. I was just like enticed. Every single frame of that movie had something for me where I was like, what's happening? What's happening? What's happening? And like it it did exactly",

And like it it did exactly what I wanted to do, which was it felt like that trailer and then the second trailer and the teasers and all that, but it was just hours and 15 minutes of that. Sure. And that the entire time I had that feeling. And I'm happy because I was right about so much. It was exactly what I wanted it to be. But I was wrong about so much. Like there's so much little things. Like I've done so many trailer breakdowns and so many little like scene analysis. And I looked at stuff and I was like, oh, this this has to be this based on this. And I'm like, I was flat out wrong. MH. About things that didn't matter necessarily. Like like the there scenes of things exploding not when I thought they'd be and just stuff like that. And that kept me in it where I was like, man, they they did such a good job. Even the people that wanted",

Even the people that wanted to know everything about this movie, I was still surprised by so much. And I was still in awe of it. It was a spectacle, you know? Like the movie start to end was a spectacle. And they rode my emotions hard. And that's that's all I could ask for from this. Okay, you know, you guys are the Star Wars fans. I'm the Star Wars. I enjoy it fine. I would never put myself on any level of fandom with you. I loved it. Thought it was a wonderful movie. The entire time I was entertained, enjoyed myself, thought the characters were great, which we'll get into of course in the spoiler one. Yeah. Uh, but yeah, I loved it. It's my favorite one, I think. You know what I mean? The Prequels obviously. And then I had no real attachment to the Original Trilogy. So this one I like the most. I like the character. I like the characters the most if",

I like the characters the most if that makes sense. I mean, that's that's my thing. I think that the the new cast is excellent. I thought they did a great job developing them and making them people that I want to know more about. And I want I can't wait to see I can't wait to see them grow in the same way that I felt about Han Leia and Luke back in the day. And in addition to that, I thought that they handled the original character so tastefully because that could have been a disaster. Yeah, such a disaster. And I thought the amount of screen time they each had and the way that their characters were handled, the respect their characters were given, and the lines that they delivered and all of that stuff was just perfect, perfect. But what about complaints? You said it wasn't perfect. Can we get into that without it being spoilery or do you",

Can we get into that without it being spoilery or do you want think that's more of a spoiler spoiler? I think it was very I think it's a very I'll say that it's a reactionary movie. Uh, in my opinion, I think it was a movie that they knew that they had to deliver this sort of movie. They could not **** around with uh, in the way the Prequels did. And they delivered a Star Wars movie. I mean, this is a Star Wars movie. And in some ways, it is beat for beat a Star Wars movie. So I mean, I think that's gonna so I think that's gonna be I think that's gonna be one of if people have complaints about it, I'm sure they will. Then then it's that's one of those things. I I I think that yeah, the new cast is very strong. I think the story is very interesting that the there's a lot of unanswered questions about about yeah, about just there's there's 30 years of missing history",

And I and I think that they're going to fill those kinds of things in. They don't really talk about a lot of the key components of like the lore actually, um, in the movie. Um, but yeah, from the Opening Crawl, I mean, the first line of the Opening Crawl actually, I'm not going to say I'm not going to say what it is. I'm just going to say the first the literally the first line of the Crawl made me I started crying right? Me too. I'm not like that's that's honestly that's that's the thing is like I literally like it wasn't just I started tearing up. There was a tear like an actual physical tear on my face. And I was like, I just can't I can't handle this right now. Even now thinking about it, I feel like I'm tearing up. Like it it got me, man. And there was multiple",

It's not a CGI **** masturbation Fest that they made with the Prequels. There's **** the the actors can actually act. And I don't think Natalie Portman for instance is a bad actress. I think when you know, you put her in front of a **** blue screen for **** seven years, she's not going to really be able, you know, she's not talking to anyone. It's so I think that they understood like what they had to do to kind of like ring as much out of this as possible. Of course, it's a beautiful movie too. And there's not everything's a practical effect. I mean, there are characters important characters that are not practical. Yeah. Um, but I think that uh, it it again, it's a reaction to what",

Um, but I think that uh, it it again, it's a reaction to what people wanted. And it reminds me of George Lucas apparently said to Kathleen Kennedy at some point when he saw the movie maybe last week or two weeks ago that, you know, this is and there was a bitterness in his in in in it to me. I don't know if that's true. But like he's like this basically saying like this is what people wanted. Yeah. And uh, Star Wars fans will be happy with this. And honestly, I think that's the best spoiler-free review we can give is this is what people wanted. Sure. And we are of course champing at the bit, I think, to talk about characters. We were all in different cars on the way home. We we didn't talk too much about it. So I think we're anxious to now talk about it and take the gloves off.
