No problem, that's what I do. Um, and I was trying to think of something that would encompass what I want. I don't want to just like show up here and say something like a like a dick joke.

Um, um, I just, uh, I wanted to do something and as I keep, uh, thinking about it, it it dawned on me that the reason I actually donated and came of the show was I got asked a question. Um, who do you want to eat dinner with if you had a chance to go, um, meet someone and sit down and talk, get drinks, eat dinner, and pick their brain a little bit? Who would that be? And I think first instinct for a lot of people is like a celebrity or a celebrity crush or maybe it's a musician or rock star or a band or maybe it's a political figure. I don't know. Uh, and it first gut response was 100% Greg Miller and Colin Moriarty. It was like, I have listened to you mean Greg, Nick, Tim, Kevin? That's the thing. We'll call him the Kollin. We get over there and it no, it honestly, it honestly clicked that I listened to, uh, uh, Podcast Beyond. I listened to Game Scoop. ****.",

I used to listen to like Week in Review like way back when when I was like 17, 18 years old. And, um, IGN's AFK. I know the best part when podcast came out then it was like, thanks for listening to IGN's Podcast Series. And it was like a Japanese, it's like they had to tell you what you were listening to because podcasts weren't a thing yet. Um, but yeah, so I it clicked in my head that I wanted to, uh, meet you guys. And that's not a slight to any of you guys, but it was just, it's been, which by the way, not to interrupt you real quick, let's let's pound it real quick.

People get that wrong all the time, but it's okay. So my mom keeps calling me my brother, my brother's name all the time, so it doesn't matter. Do you get that grown up? They call you Dag.

I had no idea that was a thing and he's like dropping **** and that's a real, he's dropping **** and that's real biggest distraction in the world. Around the 40 minute mark, I looked over there and his eyelids were heavy and I was waiting to see if he was going. Pizza sleeps were kicking in. God bless him. God bless him. He's lovely. But no, and I I definitely think that there is relatability that I feel, um, to start with it was like Colin and Greg were definitely the the the first idea, but like just this as a whole, The GameOverGreggy Show with the five of you guys, it there's relatability.

I can't say Taylor Swift and go meet Taylor Swift, but we can we can say, I mean, yeah, hope and dream and time. We just didn't do it. Wish it's really interesting you say this because like I I often think about this and where I'm at in my life now compared to where I was at even like last year and the year before that and looking back 5 years, 10 years.

And so I look at my the list of people over the years that I would have said and I'm really kind of knocking them off like like just one by one. Like you looking at Burnie Burns, Freddie Wong, um, all these people are people that I'm I'm now like friends with and I I see multiple times a year, you know? But at at certain points in my life, they would have been the people that I would have done anything to be like, I would love to spend time to just talk to you and get to know you just like you're talking about.

Um, with Freddie in in particular, a long time ago, I he when he first launched a Kickstarter for Video Game High School, one of the the perks was for and I think it was for $1,000. You can go spend a weekend with Freddie and he'll like teach you how to do video stuff and all this. And this was like Video Game High School Season 1. So it must have been like 2010-ish. And I remember being like, this is awesome. Like, this is an opportunity to get him to know who I am and I know I can prove myself to him. We'll be cool. Everything will be fine from there. And I was like, all right, I got to do that. So I came up with a brilliant idea to come up with a Kickstarter to fund that $1,000 to get me there. And I'm not doing that.

And you're the reason I didn't do that. Now, I don't think that was necessarily would have been a bad decision to do. I mean, you listen to me, so inevitably it's probably the worst decision.

Who would you want on the show? Something like that. Yeah, and I was like, there was some there was something out there. And I'm a big Bill Murray fan.

I have two hours with The Rock just to talk to The Rock because it's so there's so much to talk about with The Rock. But I, you know, his childhood and his upbringing and all that. He talks about how rough it was all the time.
