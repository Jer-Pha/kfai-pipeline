I could be, could be wrong. If I am, I will gladly stop using the term in that correct, in that, in that way. So, according to Google, retard, adjective, denoting, less advanced in mental, physical, or social development than is usual for one's age. Informal, offensive, very foolish or stupid. Retard as a verb is delay or hold back in terms of progress, development, or accomplishment. His progress was retarded by his limp. Past tense: retarded. Past participle: retarded. So you could, you could theoretically, not granted, most people wouldn't, but you could really, you could use that as a verb to describe pretty much anything that was not working correctly. That's like saying like, people, you could use gay as happy, but people don't. Well, people do, but they don't do anymore because now the word's synonymous with something that's bad. Yeah, well, they don't",

That was in a cartoon for Christ's sake. They'll have a gay old time, stones. Everybody got it. Nailed it. Yeah, so we can't use anymore. But I hear what you say. Right. Now, having said all of this, I would rather, and I would always rather people err on the side of caution, especially with Not Safe For Work, than on the side of trying to push the limits, right? Because you don't know what's offensive. And to your point earlier, we are learning that, right? And we are becoming more aware because we have people that are on like the far left, crazy social justice warrior side lashing out at people. It is making us more aware of other people's feelings, and it's always a good thing. It is a good thing overall. Tweeted me about this, really, a comment saying, 'Nick is wrong.' I",

I will take that into consideration because I'm not, I'm not purporting to like, this is not a hill I'm gonna die on as far as the word retard is concerned. Sure. But I just, again, I think the important thing to point out here is when you're talking about that you use the word retard or retard, you're saying it in a way that is pertaining to that word. If I'm using, when I was like, when I slip up and say, 'On the house, retard,' I'm saying it's stupid. You're not saying the machine's stupid. You're saying machine's working slow. I'm saying to me, I'm saying she is stupid, but I'm not necessarily equating that to, 'This machine has Down syndrome,' you know? Like I'm not using it. In my brain, it doesn't go through, 'Let's be really mean to people who have, who are less fortunate or have mental disabilities,' and then",

Whereas when I think, when I think the word, when I think the word gay, or my use of the word gay when I was younger, it was to, it was sort of, it was to make fun of homosexual people, right? It was saying, 'I'm equating you to someone who is in my brain and in the world a lesser person because of this thing that you have that all of us is weird and stupid and different, so you are that person,' right? There's worse about the minority. You are gay. You are, you know, all the things that you, you will never be me, this macho heterosexual guy.

Same with you, with fact, the word retard that you just said. Number, we use that word unless you're British. I'm gonna get you a cigarette. Goddamn. The people that I know that use those words, like they didn't use them that way. It was all synonyms. Like retard, gay, stupid. They might as well have all been the same thing. I just like, I'm with you that that's how we lose them together. And that's why I backed away from all of them. And like, I'll slip up every so often, say some stupid. But, but like, but where does it end, right? Cause the word dumb can also be used by, that's kind of what I'm saying. That's my point with that.

And like, 'Fuck you, I'm using dumb cause it's just a word that describes something that I think is not working correctly, working properly.' Sure. That retard thing is dumb. Can't say that. You have to say that thing. You have to be exact about the terminology of why this car is not working properly. Your starter's not working. These spark plugs are broken. The spark plugs need to be adjusted. I'm just saying like, I know how vehemently I was against stopping using the word retard when I heard about the Black Eyed Peas. Oh, sure.

And the story always goes that I made a bet with a guy across the hall, not even a pet bet, but like a thing of like, he's like, 'This Jason X movie,' or whatever the hell was, 'I was opening in 2001 was gonna be the number one movie in America.' 'No, no way.' And the next day he came over, threw newspaper at me. He's like, 'Number one in America.' I opened. I'm like, he left the room. So I scream across, I'm like, 'That is so gay.'

So, and I was like, it's like come to Jesus moment of, 'Don't do that.' Similar to how it was for retard for me growing up, you know what I mean? Knowing people who had it used in a negative way thrown at themselves. Like, I gotta back off and not call my friends before. Don't get me wrong, again, I would rather we live in a society where we question these things, right? Like just talking about this now, I'm like, I see your perspectives on this. This is changing my perspective a little bit on it. Now, granted, I don't use the word anyway.
