Colin, I'm going to let you kind of like lay out the the land for this one. Yeah, I think that um we've hit a somewhat of a critical mass with the nature of the way games are being launched, um and the acceptance in in gaming society is aware that this is kind of the new status quo. And this is this is disturbing to me and it's different um than the way games used to be released. Now, uh games used to be released in a vacuum. If a game was broken in any way, then a game was broken forever. And there are examples of games even back on, you know, uh back a long ways that were fundamentally broken and and or ways that you could break them fundamentally, um and there were clever workarounds to make sure",

Um Mega Man 1 always comes to to mind in Wily's Castle. There's a place where you could conceivably get stuck unless you realize you could go back down a ladder and get more energy that you can like then use to to try again or whatever. So there's like these little workarounds that make a lot of sense. But but now we have um games that are just busted in fundamental ways when they're launched and it's just becoming concerning with to me, especially in conjunction with uh increasingly unreasonable season passes, um that are, you know, launched in conjunction with games as well as uh, you know, the fact that, you know, I keep arguing that games are cheaper than ever and they are. Even at $60, they're way cheaper than they used to be um in real money.",

Even at $60, they're way cheaper than they used to be um in real money. But uh are games also not more ambitious yet launched in a more unsavory state almost over and over again? And what reminded me of this was just reading about Just Cause 3 before I even put it in my own machine to play it, about how like **** up it was for a lot of people. And give me a recap. I've seen a lot of tweets about it, people complaining. For me, it was the initial load was really long. Yeah, the load times are absurd. Uh the uh people were just having a lot of technical, I don't know if it was Digital Foundry or something, just having like significant dips in frame rate, like really bad consistent frame rate, uh memory, you know, memory leaking and like a lot of different kinds of things that I'm like, like how can you possibly launch games in the state?

I'm like, how can you possibly release this and not and expect anyone to believe that there was no inclination anywhere in your QA team or at your studio that the game was **** broken, you know? And I think that I don't know if it's the developers' faults as much as it's the publishers'. It's unclear because we're not there. But I just for every game that's that's, you know, launched and it works fine and there are no patches or no necessarily necessary patches, I think of even a game like Until Dawn works right. But for every game like that, there's a Just Cause or there's an Arkham Knight or there's a like, and I'm like, why? Maybe we're becoming a little too lax as a community with accepting day one patches and accepting games going gold when they're not ready and um publishers being really beholden and",

And and I I it it's it's disturbing to me and it turns me off a little bit now um when combined with again the very greedy nature of um season passes and and and the very um kind of suspect nature of like why games aren't delayed more and why there's so much shame in taking a little bit more time or why a company has to crunch to to go gold and then crunch again to get a patch ready for day one. Like why is that acceptable to us? Look at, you know, Tony Hawk's a great example of this. It the rumor was that they were going to lose their license and they had it and had to get the game out. But people paid for that. Mhm mhm. You know, and they just launched a 7 gigabyte or something patch for",

I mean, but that's like at this point, they're just like, what can we give you? So now you can be Ninja Turtles, which is cool. Okay, so to me, it's just I it's it's a bit of a rambling kind of complaint, but I know a lot of people out there probably feel what I'm saying. It's I think everybody does. There we we should expect more and I don't think we're getting um quality products anymore on a technical level without, you know, bogging down our hard drives with 100 Gigabytes worth of updates for games. And it's just insane to me. And it goes, it's not like it's becoming a bigger phenomenon, but it's not a necessarily a recent phenomenon. I used to kid around about how you",

I used to kid around about how you couldn't even fit Killzone on Vita on like an 8 gigabyte memory card or something like that. Like there was so many patch. The patch I think was bigger than the game. It's true. And and I'm like, like what's going on? Why are we this wasn't possible back in the day, so it didn't happen. Yeah, now it's possible and it happens all the time. And I would rather be the exception to the rule than the rule. And that's what's happening is that, you know, I go through my game sometimes and I just click, you know, you know, the options button and I look at the details. And I was going through my cross media bar or whatever on PS4 and I was like, the only game on here that doesn't have a patch is Mega Man Legacy Collection, a series of games released in the 80s and 90s that there's no reason to patch, you know, um",

So but then you go through like Witcher and you're like, Jesus Christ, how many updates are going to be on this game? Or or Arkham Knight or or anything like that. And I'm like, ah, just it's just it's it's disappointing to me. I I mean, I think those are different things though. You know, like updates to games aren't bad. It's the I was going to say required updates in the the to make it work. Yeah, exactly. Cause Witcher stuff was and I I'm sure I'm wrong. I'm sure Witcher stuff since has been to add things, they tweak comment. But the early early patches were not for that. And the early patches for any game are not for that. The early patches for the game are to be like, ****, everything's **** up. Everything's **** up. And but how big were the",

It's it's the the nature like, why can't we expect that? Why can't we expect that a game is going to work when it launches unless there's always a problem? Yeah, Nintendo. Nintendo is the one, you know, we brought up Other M before and which was the only game that really bit him in the ass during the patch period. Um but they can even patch but they can patch their games now. And and there there there just seems to be not a lot of attention paid to um I don't want to say quality, cause I don't know if that's necessarily these games are fun. It's just that there's not there's not a lot of attention paid to like finishing the game, you know? Like it's like, what state can the game get in? Let's get it on",

And I used to kind of fight against this. I I really come around on a lot of this stuff at watching the the the nature of the evolution of the industry. We at back in the day, I'm like, day one DLCs, I still don't have a problem with DLC per se, but day one DLC, not a big deal. Uh season passes, don't buy them if you don't like them and stuff.

Yeah, I mean, so like, what are what are the big perpetrators of this? Obviously, we have Assassin's Creed. Um what what was it called? Syndicate? No, no, Unity. Yeah, there was Unity. There was me talking about what broken games. Yeah, like what are the the big ones? Cause like we got Tony Hawk. We got PC Batman. PC Batman. And then now we're hearing about Just Cause. But like, is the Just Cause in that same the same realm as all those other ones? Cause that those sounded bad. This just sounds like there's technical problems here and there. Yeah, I don't know.

I I think that, well, you're naming the perpetrators and they big perpetrator. Driveclub was **** busted, you know what I mean? Busted, just totally busted. Master Chief Collection busted, did not work, you know? And then people run to the the stores and buy 343 Industries' next game or buy going to buy Evolution Studios' next game and not remember that Evolution Studios got another year to work on Driveclub. Was supposed to be a PS4 launch game. They released it a year later and the game was **** broken. And everyone's like, well, video games. And I'm like, no, no, no. Like we should expect way more because when Naughty Dog releases Uncharted 4, I bet you it's going to work. I mean, that's one that's one of the studios",

But for every one of these games, you get you I I just I understand the fatigue out there um about this issue because I think that it's it's a little bit distressing. We grew up, we're not young, you know? And we grew up in an era where games had to work. And they might not have been as ambitious. Some of them were like Grand Theft Auto 3 is an ambitious game on PS2. It came out in 2001 and it **** worked. Yeah, you know, I mean, that's the interesting thing is it's like you're bringing up the ambition. Like a game like Just Cause 3, I'm willing to to an extent like be like, all right, there's going to be some technical problems and stuff because that get **** crazy. It's like you",

But it's like that only goes so far, you know? Like for these games where just straight up doesn't work, that's not good. No, I I do think that we're just starting to find that um we're starting to find ourselves in between a rock and a hard place, I think, with publishers where the expectation is that we're just going to deal with it. Mhm. Real quick now, to your point where you're talking about, you know, people rushing to buy 343 Industries' game, da da da. We did see Assassin's Creed Syndicate dip this year on day one. And people did attribute that to the fact that Unity was so **** up that people wanted to see what happened here. We did",

So people are starting to learn. But it doesn't it's it's these are little like dents in the armor, right? They're not 343 Industries' game was profitable. And I don't wish anything against 343 Industries. It was just an example of or Assassin's Creed where it's just an example of like, are we are we rushing games? Are we are we expecting too many games too soon? Are we it's not the gamer's fault.

I remember people talking about that like that it's not fixed for some people at the time that I was still bitching about it, which was a while ago. Um but there's a short memory in the industry that I think we have to buck.

And I'm like, man, how can resist playing blah blah blah? But then you you understand, well, when you play a game like Fallout 4, which which you should expect is going to have a lot of problems because that's kind of Bethesda's MO. And and like their game is huge and there's a lot of different ways it can break and all that kind of stuff.

And it's like, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Um so Just Cause was one of those games that just brought that up in me where I was like, you know, just reading about it. I haven't played the game nearly enough to have to to have experienced anything myself. But when people are complaining like when there's explosions and a lot of **** going on on the screen, which is what Just Cause is all about, and then the game just halts, you know, I'm like, well, that's a **** problem, isn't it, you know, uh",

And like, yeah, the game doesn't really work very well, but, you know, give us like a couple months and we'll fix it for you maybe. And um oh, this game ate your save. Well, you know, sorry about that. And oh, you know, this game runs at 15 frames a second sometimes. Well, my apologies for that. And oh, the servers are down for a month on this game.

I'm like, well, that's not the ideal solution either. Has it made it worse? No, because the internet is a great thing. It's a great disseminator of information. It's a great fixer of problems. The question becomes like, when is a game really done? Is a game always released now in beta? Is a game always now just launched and we have expectations that it will be broken?
