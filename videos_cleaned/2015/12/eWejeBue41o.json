Tim, mmm-hmm. Oh my God, Tim. Oh my God, you saw me out there. Oh, I did. That was me. I want you now. I'm pausing, holding it back, reeling it the **** in. I don't know about that. Shut up. You don't understand, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Greg Miller. I'm 3 years old. I've been married. I've beaten cancer, and this is the happiest day of my **** life. Do you understand that? This is literally all I've ever wanted. You Star Wars nerds come out of the goddamn woodwork excited for a **** Super Bowl. This is what I've wanted: Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman in one **** movie. And then out of the goddamn blue, Doomsday comes. Are you **** kidding me? I'm hitting play again. Not to mention that right here, **** Clark Kent asks Bruce Wayne, clearly before they know each other, how do you feel about the Bat Vigilante? And Bruce Wayne says to him,",

Ladies and gentlemen, if you're just joining us, the rumors of Jared Leto being Jason Todd, being the second Joker, that the Joker took and tortured Jason Todd, who used to be Robin, are clearly true. It is true. Joker has a history in this DC Universe. The and that is, oh my God. And one thing has been cut to the water board in the air regulations. I saw earlier, too, like that. Oh, I can't believe that they're finally doing this. I've had to sit through so many **** Marvel movies. \"I'm Captain America. Oh, I'm blonde.\" I don't care. I don't care about any of these people.

Superman has got good. I'm sorry. I'll stop you right here. Here's the thing that boggles my mind, Tim, is that, and I know, I **** know, I will eat these words. There is no way this movie can be bad. Are you kidding me? Are you everything? Oh my God. You just keep going. Just keep. And look at for a second. You don't even have to rewind.

Of course, Lex knows Clark Kent. That's a well-known thing. I'm not talking about like old school. They're both from Smallville. That kind of ****. But it's just like, okay, sure. He's he's engaged in thing. But I always like when Clark is just like, \"I know this **** before\" or whatever. But fine, let it go. So far, I like, I like Jesse Eisenberg. Get a lot of haze. I don't get it. I like them. Here's what I will say. Here's what I will say. Mm-hmm. I want you to know right now, it sucks. How old is Jesse Eisenberg? I don't know. 8. How old is Adam Sessler? 39.

If I'm sure it's sunk up or not, I don't know. I'm editing this. I'm drunk. So here's where Superman's rock scene. This is the teaser we had seen before where Superman drops in. All the guys do genuflecting. Super and patches. They're armed. Batman up here in some kind of really sexy bondage pose. Let's get to it. No, well, yeah, this is a promise. It's not the original thing. Here we go back to the old ****. Let's bring Superman in. We don't know what he's doing. Yadda yadda. If you miss Konig alive when I broke down this trailer earlier, the teaser trailer. A Batman again in the bondage pose. This Bat-Nips. Uh, Super and drops. He's got this evil sneer. He walks up.

But then my problem, of course, was that if Batman isn't her Scarecrow gas, and gas, not grass, grass would makes grass normal Scarecrow stuff. Exactly. If Batman wasn't her Scarecrow gas, he would immediately see his worst fear. We'd have wobbly vision, all stuff. And we want to get that fight scene. We've seen the beginning of Batman throwing off the other guards. Yadda yadda. Who's this good? Will you shut the **** up while I talk? All right, keep going. So we wouldn't get the fight scene we've seen before. So it's like, okay. And then of course, the chat brought up the fact that there's been many rumors of Bizarro. Many rumors of Bizarro, which",

So when I die, I was like, you're right. Twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames. Bizarro theory. I had undersold it. It looks like it's coming through. The Superman that lands and comes at Ben Affleck, tears off the Bat-Mask, is probably Bizarro, right? He isn't evil sneer, which isn't our Superman. All these other dim things, probably him. And I'd always said that, you know, of course Lex is trying to work against Superman. Lex is trying to prove to everyone that he's bad.

Don't genuflect for me. That's not a real thing.\" Clearly now it's the other way though. Now here's where the two plans align. We'll get to in a second. Of course, I actually think with a few plans aligned, of course, with the fact that Superman lands, he's evil. My man, it's like, okay, it's Bizarro Superman. He cloned a Superman from Zod's body. Makes somewhat a sense. I'm sure though, connected. I was a Kryptonite, whatever. Because we've seen him. We'll go up to the Kryptonite like that. What's gonna happen though now is that the Superman clone starts breaking down. And where it would become Bizarro, which I would say with the white craggly face,",

The Devil, Devil does.\" Yeah, something to that effect. I don't have the lines right out. And if you haven't noticed, I'm pretty **** excited about this right now. Yeah. So the point of on my matter here is that it's not gonna turn into Bizarro. It's gonna turn into Doomsday. Keep going. This is Jeremy Irons. He's Alfred. Okay. Oh, you're right. Yes, that's this is a, this has been, no, I'm sorry, not bad. This is Superman fighting Zod when Ben Affleck, he's watching. And he holds that little girl.

Here's this coming in. They're fighting some more. But they're in this thing. I'm gonna shoot you. I'm gonna do this. I hear like, I'm gonna ask you, rewind it a bit because I feel like when Superman's getting blasted in the **** face by this Gatling gun, he looks a little chalky white. Now I want to know if he's turning not chalky white from um, Boardwalk Empire. Chalky white in terms of Bizarro-y. So can you give me frame by frame? There's one that go back two frames.

Now the question is, is this, is this Superman or is it Bizarro? Upcoming Superman.

What do you want? I want to sorry right here. This is the thing I went back to when they released the thing. And I thought maybe it was Scarecrow. But then people said Bizarro. And I'm right.

But it's like a nice big ol' block. This heat vision comes in and doesn't look it. Look at that. That doesn't look. That's a Cyclops. That is me. Exactly.

Would you like to put it on the ground now since I told you earlier I was going to be animated and this is gonna be a big **** day for Greg Miller again? Do you understand him? I don't think you do. I don't. That when uh, when Graham-Cracker Comics in Glen Ellyn closed, the woman took such pity on me. She gave me the Justice League mobile, which I hung in my bedroom and never got laid. And so what I am in **** bed as a goddamn teenager looking up at Batman one room. And this is Grant Morrison's Justice League. I don't know if you're **** familiar. Superman was on hair and ****.

You think this is Bizarro Superman turning into it? He's got a little bit of Zod's face. If you look at him, did they just animate Zod's corpse? I didn't think about that. What if, what if Bizarro Superman standing behind them? Gods killed by Devils. But they're just reanimating Zod's corpse. **** **** Zack Snyder, you are an artist. And I want it on the record. You can go check the GameOverGreggy sure where I said Watchmen was a good flick. A lot of people gonna come out of the woodwork. Snyder, you didn't like **** ****. Yeah, you weren't there, Kevin.
