Never heard of it. Don't know if any of you guys would know, really. It's not like you guys had a panel there. It's not like you were f***ing hosting live streams and f*** or anything. Oh, is that what I was doing? You know, um, I remember, so I mainly want to talk about the conference now. The one thing we're not really going to get into is Final Fantasy VII because that'll be the next topic. Ah, so the rundown real quick: of course, Uncharted 4 reveal of there's like choices in it, right? Uh, Call of Duty, yep. Y-uh, Street Fighter V, Dead Star, Adult Swim at a",

Um, Day of the Tentacle Remastered, Psychonauts, a VR game, Don't Starve Together, Hitman Go, Yakuza 5 on PS3, Yakuza Zero on PS4. Yeah, um, it was Full Throttle, wasn't it? Not Day of the Tentacle. That was already, sorry, you're they gave a date or whatever. Full Throttle. Full Throttle is my favorite one too, so I'm with Patrick Klepek on that one. Uh, King of Fighters XIV. What, Team Ninja's new game called Nioh, which kind of looks like Dark Souls. Awesome. So that's cool. That came out of not that they they showed that a couple years ago and then it dis-different name though. I think they just it disappeared and then it came back and I was like, we'll get into it.

Fat Princess Adventures. It's like, here it is, buy today. Ratchet & Clank. We saw a little bit of the gameplay, we saw a little bit of the movie. Um, release date and release date. Yes, I'm very excited about that. Uh, they had a little VR section, started off with a disaster. Um, broke my heart, poor guys. Richard Marks, we love you, Richard Marks, hanging up his guitar to do a little VR. Every time I hear his name, every time. That's why they say Doctor, so you know which one you're getting. Um, then they showed Rez Infinite, which is a VR. Things to say, things to say. Go. Eagle Flight, Ubisoft VR game that looks dope as f***. Um, and then Modern Zombie Taxi Co., which we'll see.

The next one was the cool thing I saw, I think, 100ft Robot Golf. I mean, yeah, the Corgi, you kidding me? It looks really funny, legitimate. It looks so funny. Ace Combat 7, which is a a big announcement, a hug to people that care. Uh, and then Destiny had Sparrow League Racing. Nuh-uh, no. That's the biggest, literally no one cares about that. No, not at all. No, definitely not. And then Paragon. Yep. Y-and that's about how it's that's about how it played too. Yep, exactly. And a trailer for this mobile and ending with a thud.

It would have honestly, it's so funny that even just that, it's the same content, but that would have made the conference good. People would have enjoyed. Pacing is important. Yeah, yeah, because Paragon would have been the announcement. It's always good to start with a strong announcement from somebody you recognize and then you hit them with the emotions at the very, very end. Yeah, and the surprise, you know, the Final Fantasy VII, very far. Anything more this year?

Talk to Shuhei about that shirt. What'd he say? I have spoken to Shuhei about that shirt and he was being very, very political about it. He was he was he was being cagey. He wasn't giving me anything. But he he did say, this is the exact shirt that I wore when I started when Crash Bandicoot was my first was my first project. This is the same, this is my team shirt. And so I wore it out there. I was like, yeah, but the last time you pulled something like this, we got Vib-Ribbon. And he was like, oh, did we? Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.

Oh, yeah, he's that's like a shot across Activision's bow. Like that's just like, hey guys, when I get 10,000 tweets about this, do you finally want to return my calls? I think that's what that is. Yeah, I think I think you're right in the sense that I don't think anything's in development for Crash. I think I think it is I think it's a total red herring. And I think that I think, yeah, I think it was calculated in the sense that, hey, he knew what he was doing.

I was like losing my s*** when this was happening, 'cause we get there and the first thing that happens before the press conference even started was James Schuler like looks over at me like, Tim, Tim, Tim. And he shows me this uh picture on his phone on Twitter of Shuhei with a um VR Neo Cortex hat on. And I'm like, like just hyperventilating. Like, Greg, Greg, look, it's s*** happening. I was like, I was freaking out. Like, all right, just Tim, just be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool. Then the f***ing conference starts and this dude walks out with the shirt.

Someone photoshopped the Neo Cortex on it. It looked it looked convincing. It looked very convincing. That's why you and there was no time to verify it. 'Cause when I saw that, I was like, don't think anything of it, Tim. And then when Shuhei walked out, I was like, they wouldn't troll you, Tim. It's happening. He literally looked at me. He's like, I was like, I'm like, maybe they're just f***ing with me. Look under your seat. Yeah, the new Crash Bandicoot game is there.

He's like, dude, Naughty Dog changed their PSN thing and has Crash in it. And I'm like, there's this doesn't just happen. You know, me one day Crash is just back. Like, no. And now here's the thing, like, was it disappointing that there wasn't an announcement or wasn't something? Yes, very, very, very much so. If you they ended the conference with that, I would have f***ing been done. That was just like it. 'Cause Crash, that is the one announcement I'm waiting for more than anything. Now, the Final Fantasy VII Remake's already announced, so I was freaking out about this s***. But my biggest thing is, I can't believe there was even any reference.

It's not happening. Like, I'm with Colin. Like, I know it's not happening right now, but it definitely wasn't happening a week ago. Yeah, now it's like, all right, Crash Bandicoot, PlayStation, there's still some conversations going on. But it's funny, he says it's the exact shirt, 'cause like I've looked into this and I've like been looking at it and I was like, that looks like an old shirt. This that's definitely shirt because I was excited because there was like PlayStation Insignia on it. And I'm like, it's PlayStation, it's Crash. Like, there's no Activision s*** on this.

The Naughty Dog thing was red herring too, because like that would be such a waste of resources for Naughty Dog to ever touch that s*** series. So, but I mean, but for me, it wasn't so much that, oh, Naughty Dog's making this game. It's more Crash is back. Let's talk about him again. Because for the longest time, you think Naughty Dog and what they present and put out there, it's Uncharted, it's The Last of Us, it's Jak and Daxter. Like they kind of just themselves they distance themselves from legacy. So to see him back, yeah, I mean, maybe maybe there's something in the works. I don't I don't I'm I'm sure you know, conversation. I'm sure conversations have happened.

I mean, otherwise, I think, you know, and we've said this on PS I Love You XOXO, we can get more in-depth on it because we really Greg and I really talked about everything. But uh, it's it was disappointing. I think it was a it was a very mediocre conference. Um, the lack of any first party exclusives, triple-A exclusives was mind-boggling. Um, in terms of announcements, mind-boggling. One of my announcements, uh, one of my predictions, which I thought was a slam dunk, was Sony Bend's game would be there. Sony Bend's been working on this game for a very long time. Uh, it was just really surprising that they just thought that they could somehow, I don't want to say get away",

There's got to be one big first party announcement every year at PSX. I think that that's like kind of what you're setting yourself up for. The people in that room do not care about the Call of Duty announcements. They do not care about this, you know, the the the the Battlefront stuff. They care. They're Sony PlayStation fans. Exclusives being in that room. People went crazy for the Destiny race stuff. Like that was one of the biggest pops. Well, Destiny, like Destiny is pretty closely associated with PlayStation.

Yeah, I didn't I didn't think I had no problem with the games that were shown. I just had I just think that there were things that were missing. I I think that how can I understand some of what Shuhei was telling us at our at our our panel when he was saying, you know, this is for the fans. Some of my predictions certainly were off base in terms of what they were trying to do. Um, you know, like uh price cut predictions for PS3 and Vita, that kind of stuff.

Like I I think with the exception of Final Fantasy VII, which was already announced, um, and some of the VR games that we saw, which were, you know, very impressive. Like we didn't even see The Last Guardian. We didn't even see Horizon. We didn't we like there was, you know, I reiterated on on PS I Love You XOXO that the Horizon stuff that was shown, um, at Paris Games Week was exactly what I saw behind closed doors at E3, which means no one has seen anything from that game except for this one 10-minute sequence. And I was surprised that they didn't even say like, let's show you another five minutes. We have like a that game is supposed to be out in less than a year.

This is a people in that room know what Bend Studio is. They know what Sucker Punch is. They know what all these things are. You might not, you know, I think it would have been really fun. And I was telling Greg about this. I don't think we said it on the show, but to like just have two or three minutes with every first party, even if they don't have anything to announce, just say like, well, thank you for, you know, have have Evolution come out and say like, thank you for your patience with Driveclub.

We're super we're glad you like the last thing. We'll see you soon with a thing that falls so flat on something that you're broadcasting, you know what I mean?

Yeah, but I think I think I I personally would love to create as much conjecture and buzz as possible. Everything everyone's looking at with just subtle hints, you know, like or just I would tease the s*** out of people. I I would have rather been teased by five first party studios and not have any idea what any of them are doing than just not see any of them. 'Cause we didn't see if one one f***ing person from one of those studios. Next year, I'd like to see panels on both days. And I'd like to see like you're talking about, I'd like to see first party developers all given like some time to either go back over things that they're doing or things that they they want to do in the future.

You know what's interesting to me though is like it it wasn't The Last Guardian, it wasn't Horizon, it wasn't these like PlayStation first party things. But seeing things like Yakuza, like that got a huge pop. And seeing um Ace Combat 7 and stuff. And I think so it's different. Like that was for the fans, you know? You're not going to see those games at an E3 press conference. No, I think I I agree with you. I I my my theory is this: something was cut out off the end of that conference and and the conference ended early. Uh, and it was just there was just a conspicuous absence of something. I'm not saying it happened the day of or the day before. I just think that there was a plan to show that like to show I really",

Yeah, like that's that like having been to TGS and and really been a student of that show for a long time, that's what this reminded me of games. But it shouldn't have been that way. We're TGS shows have that complexion. Western gamers because we're not going to get 90% of the games that are being talked about there. So you're kind of passive and you don't really care about some of the stuff that's being shown. And I felt that this had a similar feel of games.
