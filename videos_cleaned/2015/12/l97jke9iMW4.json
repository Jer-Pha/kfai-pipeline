This marks three months in a row where PS3 and Vita titles received no write-up or promotion. When the games were announced for October, the PS3 and Vita titles weren't even listed in the blog post. Is Sony just losing steam with their older console offerings? Are they just trying to promote the PlayStation 4 even more, or should we expect another shakeup in how free games are delivered to the older consoles, like how the annual IGC Instant Game Collection games were removed? Sony's communication has always been abysmal, but this is a worrying trend.\" I disagree, it's been abysmal. I think they communicate pretty well in terms of like, here's the sale we're doing, what's going",

Thank you, Colin Moriarty. But yeah, they do need to wind down. They want you to push to the PlayStation 4.

PlayStation 4's Remote Play functionality is officially coming to PC and Mac. Word comes by way of Shuhei Yoshida, who tweeted out that an application is currently in development for PC and Mac that will bring PlayStation 4 Remote Play out of the PlayStation ecosystem.

Just remember to do it before December 8th.\" So they're announcing a week plus ahead of time that they're going to raise the price of this. Let everyone know. And apparently it has to do with the yeah, the the the Following is quite quite meaty apparently. And I think you can buy it for even 15 bucks by itself, something like that. An interesting maneuver.

PS Noob wrote into KindaFunny.com/PSQ just like you can ask your questions and says, 'Hey Colin and Greg, needless to say, I'm a big fan. Listening to last podcast was rather serendipitous for me. The scenario you described about Wii gamers shifting to PS4 is exactly what happened to me. After completely buying into the motion control thing a few years back, I felt attracted to more conventional games exactly as you guys said. This brings me to my question: after getting into and enjoying more conventional non-gimmicky games,' he doesn't sound bitter at all, 'I am very curious to play some old school games.
