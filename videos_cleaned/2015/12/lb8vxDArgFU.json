None of those. Media Create was year. Yo, Yo-kai Watch, I believe you. I'm just, I might be wrong about that. I was surprised like Yo-kai Watch out of that. I was like, they have something huge with Yo-kai Watch and it just apparently didn't pan out very well for them in the West. I was, I haven't seen any numbers but I was reading some anecdotal stuff saying like the game was kind of soft and that really shocked me because I remember identifying that game a couple years ago based on uh Media Create numbers in Japan. I was like, this game's going to be **** huge in Japan. It is huge. You look at it, it's it's just ridiculous. But yeah, I mean, I play, it's not translated. I played a bit of it and it's I",

I played a bit of it and it's I mean, it's not for me for sure. It is, you know, I I always talk about the fact that I love Pok\u00e9mon so much but if I were to play Pok\u00e9mon for the first time now as an adult, I'm not sure if I would. But then with Yo-kai Watch, it's like I am having that experience. I'm like, this is not for me but it is also way more dumbed down than Pok\u00e9mon is. So I don't think that's a fair assessment but it's an even more kiddy Pok\u00e9mon game and that's not what I want. I want a more adult Pok\u00e9mon game. Uh but I'm sure there's people out there that do love it. But like I I wonder, I wonder if it's that same because Pok\u00e9mon's still kicking. It's not like that just went away. You know, the cartoons and all like the little kids love Pok\u00e9mon still. They're doing, they're going to do something with Pok\u00e9mon. They have something up",

I mean, it's it's it's a really, it's a predecessor of a fantastic handheld and in its own right, it is has a fantastic Library. I just think it's lost a little something along the way and there in the weird space in between two. The system, the the handheld's a little weak um and the games that are coming out on it might not be resonating with the audience the way that the DS resonated with people for a very long time. Um but it It suffers from the same problem that the Wii U suffers from. It's just they just have to do this kind of token support of it until they're ready to show the NX which I think will replace both of these and I know that they say that they'll live next to each other the",

The they, the thing is, they've said this before with GBA, GameCube, and DS. I mean that the the three pillars, that was a a huge thing for them and that didn't really pan out. So um especially for GBA. Um so you know, I I I feel it's sad to see the 3DS die but or dying but it had to happen. I mean the same thing's happening to Vita in a much more pronounced way. 3DS came out, you know, almost five years ago. So it's it has definitely, it did have a good run and it does have a vast library of amazing games. But like I look at this and yeah, Majora's Mask obviously, it's a classic, you know, and I'm happy, I'm happy that it came out on 3DS. I I was surprised that its announcement like everyone, it's one of those things where every time there's a Nintendo Direct, you go on NeoGAF and everyone's like, Majora's Mask is coming",

Like this is, I'm predicting it. It's like you never really think it was going to be announced and it was and it's like that's that's cool that it's there. Yeah, it was great to new generation. You know, Xenoblade Chronicles, like supposedly people love that game. I never really got into it and a lot of people have been busting balls about, you know, about about Xenoblade. Like, why aren't you playing Xenoblade? Why aren't playing Xenoblade? I'm like, well, I don't really want to play the Wii U and you know, people like, this game's right up your **** alley. And I'm like, I'm sure it is. Uh but it's just not what I want. That's not the direction I want to go in right now. I just, it's Greg's point.

And I'm like, I just don't want to like stop everything for this 150 hour **** role play game. You know what I mean? Like it just, this momentum killer. But I've watched and and really been reading a lot about Xenoblade and and people really love it. They have something, was Monolith makes that game, right? They have something really cool with that. I think that they have to treat it with a little more care and make sure that they segue it over to to NX to make sure that people are really seeing it in a very noticeable way because it's certainly not pushing hardware. And so the so the people that the very limited amount of people that have 3DS and more pronounced Wii U uh might not be enjoying it. Well, the I mean, the",

Well, the I mean, the biggest problem with the 3DS is you need the New 3DS to play it. So it's like even more splintered, you know? Yeah. Um so I could even play it if I wanted to. I still have the original 3DS myself, the little tiny one that's ridiculous. So yeah, yeah, you you dust it off once every two years to play something. The last time I played a game in any length, well, actually, I I I dusted off to play some Virtual Console games this year. I really want to play, I wanted to play Metroid for some reason. I haven't played in a long time. So I dusted off to play that and that was fun. But A Link Between Worlds, uh A Link Between Worlds was the last like native game I like really really like falls into. Yeah, well, I mean, after that, you know, just off the top of my head, there wasn't too many like big games you need to play like",

Bravely Second is going to be awesome um that comes out next year, I think March. So there's a few. Yeah, the 3DS, I I personally think had a pretty soft year. But the Wii U, I mean, it had a lot of games, not all of them the the highest quality. But like I I'm surprised to look at the this list and be like, oh ****, you know, we didn't get uh too many that I loved though. But like Splatoon, like yeah, people really really enjoy it. I had fun with it for what I played. Um it didn't capture me in that same way of like, this is my **** game of the year. But um it's fun and it's cool and I love that we got a new Nintendo IP that people genuinely care about. Um the fact that, you know, we see the",

Um the fact that, you know, we see the Smash Ballot and people talking about who they want in Smash and of Nintendo characters, the Inklings are up there for what people want. And that's I think a good sign. Like new Nintendo IP is a good thing overall. I I agree, especially they're not churning out meaningful IP to the degree that they were a long time ago. So to see something like Splatoon really hit, you know, and inspire people to buy the system, which they did not in huge numbers. But even my brother, you know, calling me when Splatoon came out, I was like, I finally picked up Wii U. Splatoon is awesome. And and I was like, you pick it up for Splatoon? Yeah. Oh, wow. And I was like, you know, that's cool. You know, that's it's again, not a game for me. I think the game's really clever. Um but it's not a game I would want to play. You think you'd like it",

Yeah, no, I get that. I that. Um but yeah, it's cool seeing like Game Awards, like seeing it win Best Shooter. It's like weird thing and I'm sure there's some weird politics involved in that. But like it's cool. I like that at least it's, you know, it's awarding something different. I'm sure the politics are that like half of the or not half, I guess, well, you know what I mean, a majority voted for this, another majority voted for this and then there was enough people who voted for Splatoon that those two that canceled out each other. Well, good for good for Splatoon. Yeah, no, that's how democracy works, right, Colin? Yeah, I guess Fast Racing Neo just came out like last week on the the eShop and it's awesome.",

It's really really fast. You don't like the name? I love the name because it is what that game is. It is just here was just a generic fast racing game. Yeah, but if we could have sat down for 10 minutes, we could have come up with 10 better names than Fast Racing Neo for Fast Racing AX. Maybe Neo Goes Fast. Neo Goes, that's even a better name. Neo Goes Fast. Put your pair in the slot. I like the name. I officially like the name Neo Goes Fast. Parent, put your pair in a slot. Not so I don't know what that means but I don't know if I wanted um Kirby and the Rainbow Curse just came and went. There was a lot of games like that this year in the Wii U.

Yeah, it's just too much going on when it came out that I couldn't enjoy it the way I wanted to. Yeah. Um I love Yoshi games are my favorite but it this it's not 10 out of 10. It is very seven out of 10ish. So that was disappointing. But we did get a lot of that stuff just consistently throughout the year. We got okay Nintendo games. Uh Mario Tennis, Mario Tennis, another example. Okay Nintendo games. Yeah, I was going to say, I mean, based on like the way people feel about that Animal Crossing game and and Mario Tennis, like I wouldn't even say they were okay.

But that's just because a lot of it was subpar to okay. So like the Yoshi and Kirby are the okay ones. And then Mario Tennis and Animal Crossing, whatever the hell it's called, the the board game Amiibo Festival. It's like they just did that. They just like put that. That's not a real Animal Crossing game, you know? No, definitely not. Um and then there's there was other things like that too there with the uh with Mario Party 10 which could have been awesome.

They could have made it a kind of greatest hits of all the Mario Party stuff and really kind of won people back. And it being the 10th one, like that that's event. But it it wasn't. Yeah, I don't know their names on all these games and this is this is unusual year to watch for me. Um Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water finally coming over here. Um I didn't I didn't play that one. Um you're missing the you're missing that um the big one. I'm waiting for the big big one's coming. Okay, Devil's Third. Oh, then there was Devil's Third, another terrible game.

Like the DLC offered for Mario Kart was essentially like each one of them combined would be half of what Mario Kart had total. Sure, super cheap and it gives you cool things. It finally made Mario Kart what it should be, which is just Smash Bros. Here's Link stuff, here's F-Zero stuff, here's uh Animal Crossing stuff. It's just and Baby Park. Yes, yes, yes. Um so I loved that and I loved that it was just like kind of like we got the first bit last year but it ended this year. And then Smash Bros. which is just the damn gift that keeps on giving.

I was like, ooh, this is a good sign that we know there's DLC but it's a bad sign that we're only getting one character shown. Like I was like, I wish that it was more like there's this many more to come because I thought that meant maybe we'll get one after that and then call it a day. But we've seen consistent like characters, you know, and levels. And I love that they're they're really using Smash Bros. as a way to promote their other games.

I love that it's just like there's now these platforms for them to go on and I hope that this is experimenting for the NX. NX going to give us you. Um no, Mario Maker. I mean, that was one of the things that was amazing is like, oh, you guys want checkpoints? Sure, we'll give you that in like a month, a month and a half. Here you go. Like, okay, cool.

And my favorite thing is that it makes me think about Mario differently and it teaches me things about how the gameplay works that I would have never thought about. Like the way that you can use turtle shells and the way that you can throw items in the air and catch them and do specific things. I'm like, that's built into the gameplay and people are now using those as challenges that Nintendo would never do. Sure, because that's too complex of a a mechanic.

They're going to give it to me hard. You better hope so. I'm hoping. I really am. Everything rides on this. Everything rides on it and we all know it.
