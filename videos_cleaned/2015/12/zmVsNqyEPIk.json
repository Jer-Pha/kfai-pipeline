When surrounded by almost literally ran into people, he was that most into some panel I was going to, I think our panel maybe, and he was surrounded by this entourage which I found myself like caught in for like a moment as it was walking through. He was like literally like, yeah, and that was the moment you're like, you're not, you don't know, you're done, you're no Ken Ham. Wow. I'm okay for people. I don't know Ken Ham. He's a creationist and Bill Nye debated, and it was the **** funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. Yeah, so this is show we talk about video games, all that stuff.

Surprised me too, though. The Witcher 3 surprised me too. Yeah, yeah. The argument was back in the day between Colin and I. I said on Colin & Greg Live that The Witcher 3 would win a Game of the Year award, and he said, no, it won't. And then we listed on the boards, just hanging sites, 10 sites. I was like, from one of these 10 sites or programs or whatever, it's gonna be your finest moment. I'm not been having a good number one at-bat. Geoff Keighley, you had to you had to have known that the odds were against you on. No, no, I did, but I like making bold, bold assertions so that if you get it, you can say you're right. Exactly.

So I cannot to announced. Yep. Shadow Complex Remastered. I was really excited. Yeah, that's Chair coming back. Hopefully it's a harbinger of things to come in terms of a sequel. Mmm. The Walking Dead: Michonne. Yeah, this is working out. Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn. Oh my God. No one's excited about. Oh my God, that is Shaq. It is good. Why hire though? Of course, Shaq was awesome. I don't know. I I didn't like that. Oh, what the game, the game is doing what it should be doing. I think it's hitting that like I just like the Shaq models' traps. Uh-huh.

Out a picture of Fonzie jumping the shark because Telltale has just disappeared for a little while. I'm getting sick of it. Can I tell you why I'm excited about it? Please do. Because as the Arkham games have gone on farther and farther, and they become more about like how many people can Batman punch in the face within 13 seconds, sure, or how many rockets can he shoot out of his car? I like the idea of a Telltale game that can maybe give a little bit of depth and credence to the actual detective part of it and to the Bruce Wayne part of it, which is very sweetly missing from the Arkham series. So that's kind of why I'm interested in if you see what you're coming",

So that's kind of why I'm interested in if you see what you're coming from on that tail. It's too much. It's the same reason I was excited when they announced the Marvel games is the fact that now you can take these and have them in a more comic book-y way where I'm going to be reading along, making choices, be internalizing what I'm about to and what happens when I go without without a Telltale game. You can't make like a for instance, like a Spider-Man game that has like what some of the most iconic Spider-Man scenes of all time, which is like Peter and Mary Jane talking about whether he really has to take on so much. You know, this you can really get into the story. Yeah, and the great always says, but it's just like you just don't need to play the ones, play the IP that you like and the other ones.

Oh, man. I don't understand. I don't understand. Like I really do feel like that studio is, you know, that is gonna fall off a cliff one day. Like it's just like like I just I I eventually feel like it's just it's too much, too much going with the games being as similar as they are. You're right, because right now they have an engine, they plug content into it, and we're going to get to a point where everybody's like, oh, I know what a Telltale game is, and I'm not very interested anymore. I'll have to switch it up again. I don't I think they've got a couple years before they have to do that.

Some people were excited, some people like, Jesus Christ. And one of the things I was talked about on PS I Love You XOXO that I didn't realize, having not played a Telltale game a couple years really, but reading a lot about it is that for a lot of people, like their shits still broken and yeah, eating saves or just chugging him along. But whatever it is, and to me, it's just like I wish they would just disappear and like really hone, you know, the engine and make it, you know, run better 'cause I was under the assumption that it was bad at this point, but apparently for a lot of people it isn't.

Interviewed by a couple of different people in different Variety. Yeah, Variety interviews me. I've never saw it go to print, so don't worry about it. Then IGN interviewed me on the line. He had his back when I was coming up on him, but he'd already see me. So I walked up and stood there. He turned around. He's like, okay. And I'm like, hey, interviewed me or whatever. That's amazing.
