Yeah, you know, I'm this young hip kid, I'm doing all these young young so much anymore so and emojis, mle, are something that came from my generation of people and my generation people use them and they seem like something that I would use a lot. I do not use them that much. Yeah, and I feel like I should know more about them. Sure. I I do use them, mh, but I'm not as well versed in them as I I wish that I was. Can I ask a question before we continue? Yes. What is the difference between an emoji and an emoticon? Okay, so that's what I'm saying. I'm not that informed in all of this. Emojis are the images, right? So emojis are they're the images that you use in that some uni code. I don't know what all this **** means. Googled it and I tried to figure it out cuz now I I realized that I'm old when I need to Google these things but aicon is the more old school you stuff I use symbols",
