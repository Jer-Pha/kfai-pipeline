They in a very very bad breakup and as much as they dance around it in terms of Konami statements or whatever or Kojima, you know, not even having one statement and then never addressing it again like you can read between the lines that shit's gone South and it sucks and it really really really sucks. You know what I mean? Because you figure from what I've played of it at that two-day event like this is the magnumopus. This is like the Metal Gear game he's probably always wanted to make.

The Igarashi situation was much more behind closed doors but you know clearly they just locked him away and **** wouldn't let him make any games that he wanted to make and then um you know with this situation it's just like you know again the Igarashi situation is all anecdotal and so is this it's just because we still have not heard from the horse's mouth himself about what the hell happened but that's why it's that's why it's it sounds mean spirited and it's and it's like the way I put it is way nicer than a lot of people are **** put.
