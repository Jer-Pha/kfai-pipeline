Frisco and Plano. We hit Plano for a little bit. We were in Plano quite a bit. The IHOP. The IHOP was in Plano. Shout out to Plano, Texas. You know what's funny is that, you know, people obviously give different cities crap for different reasons, right? I give Riverside crap. We had some fun in Plano, Texas. We had a lot of fun in Frisco. So I can understand that living there is different than just visiting, because we obviously hit all the hot night spots like IHOP, Denny's, Torchy's Tacos. Yes.

But what I was going to say is you slowly devolve into a 20-something on spring break. Because it started, we got there and you were dressed and you were beaten by life. You were an old Nick Scarpino. You'd seen some things. And then you switched into the shorts when it got super hot. Then the t-shirt was all the time and it was loose and it was fitting.

It's the only way to put things, yeah. And I said, Tim, those hats... Exactly. We saw the Mega 64 guys. We were in the same signing room as they were. We're friends there. And we're friends of theirs and we've hung out with them before. And so I noticed there was something these dope Mega 64 hats and I'm like, hey, I want one of those. Fully willing. There it is. There it is. Look at him. Look at how young he looks. Nick, did you go to Panama City? Did you go to Panama City? Call me Nicky. I want to be called Nicky. I never heard him say that.

We'll put that here. Actually, I'll put it on Superman. Okay. Superman. And then something weird happened. We were in the VIP lounge and they had smartly hooked up a few gaming systems. Now, I don't know if you guys are familiar with this particular system, but it was the N64. Oh, the fun machine they called it. And the first game we played was a little game called GoldenEye, which I have said before, and I'll say it again, I'll wreck any of you at GoldenEye.

Then we picked up Mario Kart. Now, here's the funny thing about Mario Kart, Tim. I've always told you, we played Mario Kart before and let's play some kinda funny games. And I've often told you that if we ever picked up the Mario Kart 64, that I would eat your lunch. Let's quote what you said. I thought there was a different word he said at the end, but instead of lunch, no, we do. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like a cupcake. Y'all listen to too much Nicki Minaj.

I always remember things a lot more fondly, I think, than they were in the light of the day. But I got better at it. I got better at it. And toward the end, I was like, I'm actually remembering one match. I won one match and battle mode. Most would say that it was the best.

Almost. Yeah. Yeah. Longer than I thought. You thought you were going to beat it on the plane, but then you fell asleep. I fell asleep. A lot of this is what I saw. We were across the aisles and we were across the aisle from each other. And I looked over and the best was you were still holding it, but you were like this. Looking out at me the entire time. But your iPad was on for a while. You literally blinked at something.

You were serene. And then that was the complete antithesis of the dude that was next to me who was sleeping. So I had a guy, like one row up that I was just staring at. And he had one of those giant neck braces on that not, it wasn't like a medical condition. He put it on so that he could sleep. And he was snoring so loudly that the only thing that actually I could do to not kill him was focus on the guy next to me who was doing this every five seconds. And I was like, do you need a tissue?

Don't come back. Because you're pissing me off. Yeah. It got to the point where I was trying to finish my Anne Rice novel that Colin so astutely pointed out. It's taking me seven months to read. And I'm like, I'm going to finish this on this plane because I'm so tired. This damn thing's heavy. It's not as good as I want it to be. It's taking way too long to read.

And so I had to put on my headphones and I put the sleep machine on. Oh yeah. Which actually sounded like the airplane we were in, but just in my ears. And I finished the book. No, I couldn't sleep on that plane. There was just too much stuff. I mean, I blame United. I blame United for that man that sat next to you. I believe United for like the two hour delay in the plane, trying to get there for my bagel at Starbucks before I got on the United plane, being a little stale. Mine was like fluffy.

Southwest is terrible. Yeah. I'm going to give a shot. Cause Virgin America showed up. Yeah. It was the premier airline for a while. The thing about United is that statistically it showed like they are bad. They're a bad airline, you know? And they have like whole Twitter account, like popular famous Twitter accounts.

And it's like, but that requires me to fucking fly United again. You understand what I'm saying? Cut me a check for a hundred dollars to cash. They're so bloated and they're just, I don't have good experiences on them. Typically. Sometimes it's fine. I, I interestingly, when I fly them internationally, I have fewer problems when I fly them domestically. But they just getting to Texas, we were on the plane. They don't talk to you.

Then on the way back, they just arbitrarily delay the flight, but then don't update the boards that the flight's delayed at all until they say something. They just, the problem is that airlines is zero sum, like flying airlines zero sum game, you go for the cheapest thing there is. So there's no, there's very little brand loyalty with airlines. There just is. And, and, uh, so no one pays for like the, you know, their consumer crimes as it were. But I think United is just, it's just trash. Like it's just, it's just a bad airline. It's a product of its own success, right? Cause it's so big that inevitably it's just acceptable that they have 0% of their flights just that are fucked up. Like to put it in context, we're bitching.

We've had, this is convention season. So right now we're in the stretch of four cons in five weeks. This is our second and they were back to back and they're all fun, but they do take a toll out of you. So by the time I got to the United terminal and I already had three text messages from United telling me that the flight was delayed by a half hour, then an hour. Um, I was already pissed off. And then you just get there and you can tell it's not the, it's not their fault. It's just the people that work for the airline have to deal with people who are pissed off all the time.

And like, you know, once you got to the flight, the flight attendants were really nice and then the pilot did his job correctly. Everyone did the job correctly. Nobody died. Um, but getting there, that was the, that was where if it hadn't been for you guys, I probably would have lost my shit. The hat though, the Mega 64 hat also kept you balanced because it reminded you of being young at spring break. Beautiful babes running around. That's true. No, I met the flight to Texas. I would have lost my shit if you guys weren't on there. That was because you had the promise of the hat. I mean, understand what happened on the flight to Texas, right? We got on the plane on time.

Right. Which by the way, does not instill confidence that the guy might've just gotten out of a six hour cross country flight and is now flying me other four hours. Like, thanks for that. Yeah. So they, they, you know, the pilot just doesn't show up, which is again, and again, this is not personnel issues. It's it, it is some way.

Let me preface this by saying this theory has been around for a while and I just want to go a bit more in depth. Also I love the Jokers look.

Then he came back and he was Red Hood running around doing that thing and stuff. Um I know what you're thinking. That's kind of lame. The Joker is the Joker not Jason. My theory consists of number one the newspaper with the you let your family die. We saw this in the Batman V Superman trailer right? Where we looked at it and said oh well it's somebody writing in because the way the Wayne building got destroyed in Metropolis. And those people die.

This is you know we're not honor Jason's memory. This Robin who passed away or whatever beaten to death. This would imply that he I don't think he would keep it up if it was a defaced from the get go. So what is it defaced in this movie? Is it defaced in the timeline we're dealing with? Right. And if so how would the Joker know how to get in there? Joker then know that Batman's Bruce Wayne. Is it not that I know anything about it. It's possible that it's a reminder of his hatred or like how he's target. And he so that's always been the condition of the suit. It's very possible that that's the case.

I would think I wouldn't imagine that that was a fresh thing that just happened. Sure. Next. The you let your family die thing in the newspaper. I like that makes sense to an extent. Cause why? Cause you know very few people outside of us refer to their their coworkers as family right? I don't think that's a normal thing. And so unless there's Dominic Toretto does. It's true.

But why would you blame what he opened to Wayne Enterprises building in Metropolis? So now he's liable for everyone getting crushed by a bunch of super powered heat vision dudes. That doesn't make much sense. Jason using it against him would make sense especially with the same kind of scrawling handwriting. Right? This is interesting because without knowing this theory at least those two things you said I didn't think of it the other way. I thought of it this way like from the get-go.

Like that's the thing is like I can make a million assumptions and reasons for all these things and like Oh but I don't have the motivation for them. Well maybe the Joker knows but he's the Joker.

But like the theory goes into the interesting points of like the branding's interesting. Obviously his teeth are all fucked up. Right.

So let's not talk about let's not talk about the Batman Arkham Knight stuff anymore. I'm unpacking my head now. We're done with the Arkham Knight spoiler there. The theory that goes into this right. Is the fact that in this world Batman V Superman let's say Batman beat Joker already. He didn't kill him obviously but his story wrapped up and we he knows he's dead. Joker's dead. You know we saw the body. I know how this is. And then he gets the paper and opens it up and your family's dead. And that Joker scrawn. He's like what the fuck? You know what I mean?

And then he sees him and knows it's Jason Todd that this is something that happened. This is how it's spriteled out from just the sheer storytelling perspective. It's kind of that would be an interesting and almost brilliant move because then you would be you would essentially be taking away the number the biggest chance for criticism that movie's going to have which is the Joker wasn't as good as Heath Ledger.

I haven't watched Batman Beyond too much but I know they had a younger Joker that was they were just they were like Hey we want to be the Joker. We're taking up the mantle of the Joker. So in this case it would be actually pretty fascinating to watch that because then people really the argument of like he's not as good as Heath Ledger's Joker would kind of go away. Cause you're saying essentially it's not the same character. It's someone playing the Joker playing or someone playing a character playing the Joker. If that makes sense.

But my, the, what I'm, what I'm questioning is whether or not they're doing, and this is solely because of the suit that, that, that unbelievably awesome homage to the Dark Knight Returns where he has to, in order to fight Superman, he has to make the, like get the big electrified suit.

And it just like a blast of memory that that Italian beef with you can get cheese with a nacho cheese on top of it. I'm like that Saturday is the first time we're going to we're going Wednesday probably Thursday or Friday Wednesday we're going to Buena Park until next time. It's been our pleasure to serve you.",
