It's **** awesome. We Lo weal if you remember the yeah, it's funny you said that 'cause you were you were a little disenchanted with it. The the PlayStation post show after we came when we sat down and did the what do we call the Gamescast post show for Sony. Uh, yeah, I came out and we got to that point and I said, 'I'm sick of seeing this demo. What the **** is this game? I'm sick of seeing we're going to climb into the spaceship. Oh, we're flying around. We went to this planet. Now we're down here. Now we're doing this. All right, demo over.' And you're like, 'What the **** is happening? What am I doing here? What's the moment-to-moment gameplay?' And so yeah, on Thursday after E3, I got to go there and that would have if we had seen that in the regular week that for sure would have gotten one of my faces and I would have made an",

And so yeah, on Thursday after E3, I got to go there and that would have if we had seen that in the regular week that for sure would have gotten one of my faces and I would have made an argument for game. Yeah, for sure. Damn, it's that good, dude. I mean, it's I mean, if we want to start in a very try to get to a sense, it's Minecraft in space, which is, you know, awesome. It's Open World Minecraft in space, you know what I mean? The whole galaxy, everything else. This the point of the game is that you're trying the everyone's trying to get to the center of the universe. There's something there. We don't know what or whatever. Um, and the way you're doing that is everybody starts with a small ship and then you go and you harvest resources to bu you make your ship better, to make your suit better, to make better guns. And then you're, you know, using that hyperdrive lets you get closer to the center. You start jumping out, you know, 'cause he did the thing right where you pull out and you see all he's",

You start jumping out, you know, 'cause he did the thing right where you pull out and you see all he's like, 'All these are Suns that have planets rotating da da da.' Like you do all that. And so it becomes this game of how do you want to play and what do you want to be in this world? And you can be the Explorer. You can, you know, be going trying constantly to get closer to that. You can be the trader. You can be the fighter. You can be the guys who's running freight. You can be the guys just gaming the system and going from going to part you Galaxy A. Yeah, this is this because they were talking about they have testers who are playing it right, who aren't even landing on planets. What they're doing is going to different galaxies, going to the trading shops that are like on the space stations, right? Buying element A at a really cheap rate because this galaxy sells it cheap. Then going to another galaxy, buying",

Then going to another galaxy, buying element B because it's super cheap there. Then going to Galaxy C where they combine them and then sell this thing at an inflated rate, making money hand over fist doing that. And that's all they're doing. And so that's the thing. And like Colin said it when we were talking about like what I got out of it, right, is that it feels a lot like Eve Online in a way, right? Where there isn't economy growing here and there's all these different people. And, you know, they were talking about it like, you know, all right, this is, you know, you can jump in there and you can get this resource and you can come out and this planet's rich in this resource. You can go down there. You can spend all your time harvesting and getting what you want and then fly out. But there could be a pirate just waiting out there who isn't",

But there could be a pirate just waiting out there who isn't ever in the mood to go harvest and will shoot you down or try to shoot you, take your stuff and get get it back. And would the pirate be a person? This is the question. I don't understand how multiplayer works in this game. And it was one of of those things I didn't ask in the demo just because I was caught up and everything else. But talking about, I'm like, 'Oh, I'll look at previews after the fact and go look.' I Googled around before this Gamescast and there's not even a definitive answer. And what they were saying in 2014 is that there is traditional multiplayer in it, but it might it won't be ready for launch. But that was in 2014. 2015, Kevin, correct me if I'm wrong, the way they were talking in this demo made it sound like it's going to be a real thing. You have somebody there playing. He's shaking",

You have somebody there playing. He's shaking his head, yeah. And so that's what I'm unsure about 'cause like it's it there's definitely multiplayer in the sense of that asynchronous thing of I get to a planet, I'm the first person there and I scan it and I because this is the Explorer track, right? Where maybe I don't want to even give a **** about the center of the galaxy. I just want to explore planets and have a good time, get resources, build a better craft, build a better suit, build a better gun. And then I'm just exploring different planets. I land there. If from the first person there, I scan it, it'll say, 'You found this animal on top of the, you know, whatever creature. You found this planet. Go to one of the upload link posts. Go there. Upload that to the world.' Then I get to name the planet. I get to name the animal. I get to do all these",

I get to name the animal. I get to do all these different things, you know, you know what I mean? So then filter into your world. So if you ever get to that planet, it's there. But they talked like he he said something along to the effect of like, 'You could have not a gang, but you could have like a roving band of guys,' which makes it sound like, 'Okay, so there is real time multiplayer right there.' But unclear. And I haven't been able to figure something out online. That's a failure on my I did a brief like scanning of a couple articles and I saw people make reference to that this is not an MMO even though people think that it is. It's more of a single player game with yeah, it's this weird thing. And that's and it's, you know, like I said, I was down on down on it just because I was sick of seeing the same demo.

And it wasn't until we were on the planet shooting things, collecting them, going in and seeing like the the their their periodic table filled out of what they've discovered and what they have and how this works into that. I was like, 'Oh, okay.' You know what I mean? Like that. And I assume that's how this multiplayer is going to be too, how it's got to click where I have to see what's happening to figure out what's going on. So was there combat? Yeah, combat. You're fighting other people? Well, A, in the demo, yes, I'm fighting AI. Yeah, what it was is, you know, you land on the planet. There's going to be peaceful animals and sometimes there's going to be hostile animals. And you shoot them and whatever. Even if it's peaceful, you can shoot a whole bunch of stuff. But",

So they they you have like a GTA wanted level, right? Where it starts ticking up of like, 'Hey, you're really **** up this planet. Why are you killing all the?' And they'll come out and you kill them and then it goes up more and then you try to get out. But in that galaxy now you have a wanted level. Really? And so there's space stations out there with these orbs that are coming out or not orbs, you know, uhst you mean, right? What did I say? In the galaxy? Because there's only one galaxy in the game, right? No, it's well, I mean, how do you no, no, I guess yeah, I guess the system is what you're saying, right?

That's the the game. Yeah, yeah. So then the systems would be all the different planet system clusters around the sun. If they were multiple galaxies and it was like the game is unfathomably big, but it's still infinite Suns or whatever. So yeah, it still is unfathomable. That's the whole problem. But yeah, if you jump to another system around another star, then yeah, you're fine. And that you that you drop you new wanted level there or whatever. But there yeah, there's other there's dog fighting. There's the ships to shoot down. There's people to run from. There's all this stuff. So do you have a health bar? Yes. What happens if you die?

And I'd lose all the resources from the last upload sync point or whatever you want to call it. You go ahead. I does it seem like there is an actual game campaign? Is there a campaign mode? He's nodding his head, yes. I think there's a campaign as much Minecraft as a campaign. I mean, there's more drawn out goal of something's in the center of the galaxy. Everybody's being drawn towards the center of the galaxy. But they were saying like when they launched, they're going to go very Minecraft-y in we like on version one.

They want you to get out there, get into this world and you and I have a real conversation whether it be through the internet in or in person of I element whatever and element whatever and I put them together and made element to ever. You know what I mean? Like they want it to be like there is this movement behind it that you're finding stuff. And then later on they want to start rolling out updates like that and make it a bit more clear. But they want it to be the wild west when the game first comes out, which is cool.

And he's like, 'Yeah, there is no Rover right now, but that's something, you know, we'd love to add later on down the line.' Like they see this evolving like Minecraft. When they talk about it now, I'm throwing Minecraft around a lot. In the demo, they did not throw Minecraft around a lot for the record. Let me ask you this. Let's play t a little bit 'cause we're trying to figure out like the readiness of this game. Yeah, this game is it's impossible to make a vertical slice for this game. So that's that's one that's one clue that they kind of glossed over at the conference, but didn't really like he was like, 'We're playing the game organically. We're going to find.' Yeah, he like, 'Hey, I'm going to jump to here. I don't know what I'm going to find.' So,",

I don't know what I'm going to find.' So you've played a lot of games. You and I have done a lot of demos and know a lot about the games industry. How what is the level of polish on the game right now? What in other words, what are the load times telling you? What is the interface telling you? What's the polish telling you? Sure, sure, sure. About about the game. What was locked off if anything? These should indicate when this game's going to come out. Yes, all the things you just listed were giving me a thumbs up. Load times weren't atrocious there. I mean, there there was one where he's like, what did he say? 'This is we were loading and he's like, 'This is taking 15 seconds right now. When it ships, it's going to take seven.' Like that's how it's going to be. I think it was the hyperdrive jump or whatever. Um, that looked great. I didn't jump. I didn't have like",

I didn't jump. I didn't have like we were there passing the controller on. So there wasn't a lot of menu stuff. Interface wise though, it looks locked. Like it's one of those things like it felt like this what I was planning could be released and I would pay money for it and be happy with it. You know what I mean? To run around like 'cause like the thing we were doing, right? And we've talked about on the other show, I know, is like there's real it's like Red Faction. There's real, you know, you're damaging the terrain. You're shaping the planet. So like I jumped into a basically a giant crater hole, right? And it's like, 'Well, how do I get out of here?' And grant that I had a jetpack so I could just go up and fly out. But I also then just took my G-gun secondary function, which he had upgraded obviously to a crazy thing where I'm just shooting out",

So I just made, you know, a tunnel up by aiming a little bit. Not tunnel up, you know what I mean? Like a slope up or whatever. And like all that was running great. No falling through the world. You know what I mean? Like textures are there. It looks great. Like I think at the very least, I feel like we're getting really close to a giant beta of like, 'Hey everybody, let's try this game out.' You know what I mean? I wonder if that's the announcement. I wouldn't be surprised if that was their thing where they're like, 'Hey everybody, Nov. October November, No Man's Sky open Beta or PlayStation Plus beta or what whatever leading up to our 2016 release.' And they run with that for a while.

Yeah, I want so any word on because this is still a confusing thing to me. And I'll look at it again. Actually, can you go on on Go to No Man's Sky Wiki, like just his Wikipedia page? Sure. Because one of the questions I have for you about this as well is to clear up some confusion that I have personally about the way the game's talked about. Is this game coming to other consoles? Do we know anything about that? Sony's treating it like it's a first party game, right? And they've said that in the past as well that they're they're treating it as if it's their own game. Are they publishing it? Like who's paying for this **** game? And it's and it's hell, I'm asking you quite like interrogating you, but",

And it's and it's hell, I'm asking you quite like interrogating you. But you you had time with the game. Yeah, is Hello Games still a very small studio? Because they were they were like no more than 15 people, I think, at the most when they were making Joe Danger. So they're still small. So like how are they making a game like that? Like there there's so many qu I don't understand how they're making this game. So wait, hold on. It says it says the game will be released simultaneously for PlayStation 4 and Windows. Yeah, so platforms is is only marked as Microsoft and PlayStation 4 on the Wikipedia page. Um, I just still feel and I I know like I don't want to treat it like it's real exclusive. It's on PC. It's not really. But unless you play, you know, a lot of Xbox games are on PC. I think that's a reasonable way to treat it exclusive. There's something tells me Sony's like all",

Um, but I'm wondering if the beta is sooner. I wonder if the beta is like in August. And I wonder if the game comes out this fall. You know, that would be crazy. That would be super nuts. And it's state of readiness that you were talking about. I mean, it just seems to be optimized for a controlled thing. Yeah, I mean, of jumping around. You know, I mean, it's still procedural generated, right? And he was talking about like, you know, you're we're asking what if you warp into a system and warp into a like Star Destroyer or whatever. And he's like, 'That shouldn't happen.' But it just happened during one of our other demos where a Star Destroyer came in and crushed me. And it's like, 'That's not",

But it just happened during one of our other demos where a Star Destroyer came in and crushed me. And it's like, 'That's not how it's supposed to happen, but it can happen that way.' So all right, two more other questions for you. Sure. I'm I'm on The Verge article who it's funny because they I came to you guys and I tweeted actually as soon as we finished like, 'I finally played it and I'm I'm now a believer.' And they had that was a headline of the story, which always made me laugh. Um, what is the cost and is it a retail game? Ooh, good question. I don't think it's a I don't think it's a retail game. I think it's 60 bucks. 60 bucks? Really? I do. Yeah, yeah. They don't have any see, can you go we all **** up at once and didn't ask about multiplayer. Can you go back to Hello Games or can you go back to the Wikipedia page and look at Hello Games' staff size? Sure. None of this makes any sense. You know, like from like like that's what",

I I think Sony and Hello Games has to look at it and be like, 'It's it we're trying to do Minecraft again.' And again, I'm the only one throwing around Minecraft like that. They didn't. Yeah, they have 10 employees. I don't understand how they must have a million contractors of this game. I can't imagine. I have so many questions about this game. That's why I'm so impressed about it. At one point, I'm like, 'I don't really care about it.' Or I didn't. A lot of people are crazy about. We were still all gen. Everyone's like, 'Oh, No Man's Sky.'

You know what I mean? Like let's go explore space. Let's just hang out. And that's what I I was saying to you guys. I point Kevin and the Hello Games guys have like it totally seems like the perfect game to wind down with every night. Sit down and maybe only play for an hour, maybe only play for 30 minutes. And you're just going to go chill and find a new planet and harvest whatever resource, you know, is in this galaxy that you or whatever this uh system that you need. It sounds interesting. It's definitely such a unique game to the point where I'm like, 'What the hell is this?' And then once now I think we're finally that point of not knowing like it's no longer just the demo.
