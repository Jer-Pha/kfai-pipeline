Yeah, just the certain part you like announced me during the press conference. You just totally didn't say my name right? And I'm like, how long have we yeah, how long have we known each other? But then I was thinking like you said it, you say it right probably 99% of the time. Yeah, exactly. Thanks for calling me ****. I appreciate it. No problem, Morey. Yeah, Call's a good dude. So here's the thing, the reason I bring up this topic is there's been a lot of hate recently. A lot of people upset about stuff because the internet and that's how things work. But I don't like that cuz I want to I feel like there's a lot of good on the internet. We should talk about that more. We've always talked about this. We have a good community. We have people that enjoy positivity and all that stuff, but I feel like there's a lot of other people out",

We have people that enjoy positivity and all that stuff, but I feel like there's a lot of other people out there that maybe don't get enough love. Maybe some of them do get enough love, but I want to give them a little bit more love because when it comes down to it, we are public figures in the video game space. You guys are the coolest dudes in video games you've heard about. So that means there's a lot of people that kind of look to you guys for your opinions and all that stuff, right? But at the same time, we look to other people for their opinions because we're fans of games just like everyone else is. So we read articles on these different websites, we watch YouTube videos, we watch all this different the content that people make. Who is some of your favorites that you go to? Justin Moyer, like him. Polygon, is that what you want? It's OB bio. Yeah, West Virginia as well has a baby, I believe. Now these kids all they",

Here's what I think of this game in a nutshell. He's one of the first people I believe that turned me on to Gone Home back in the day. Uh, when the Batman review embargo lifted, he was on there answering people's questions to the best of his abilities, any spoilers and stuff. I was really appreciative of that again, not ruining them, but there uh Ray former Achievement Hunter over on Twitch. I like what everything he's doing is super fascinating now. Uh, Jeff Gerstmann, Giant Bomb, of course, you know, San Francisco here, a Bay Area person. I'm sorry, I'll give you more of these bios. No kids, I believe. Oh, no kids. Okay, no kids.

Okay, no kids. You believe I believe I believe he believes that him and Brad Shoemaker look there might be something going on there little father son stuff. Brad is his kid. Yeah, from the future. Yeah, makes sense. Those are those are people I jump to when you say like who do I respect, who do I think about on that level, who do I want to hear about when you know, hear from I guess when games come out, that's my list. Well, you call um I think that in terms of raw writing ability, I think actually Vincent Janito at IGN is one of the most underrated, not the most significantly underrated writer in the entire industry. Um, in terms of media, I think that as someone who edited a lot of his work, I wouldn't walk around and openly admit to people. I'm like you're way better than I am, but he was one of the people and he was like you know was many bars",

Did I j be like, I wish that I could write like you, you know. Um, I write differently. I have my own voice and I think I'm a good writer, but um he has command of language and says things in his reviews as and criticism that I was like I wish I could I thought to say something like this. Um, so I think that in terms of just underrated people that I don't think get enough credit, I think he's one of those people, but he's always in the trenches like you just don't see him and so I think that's part of the reason why um he's kind of under the radar for a lot of people. Um, from there I'd go to the old standby. I think Jason Schreier and Patrick Klepek at Kotaku are probably the best journalists in the industry. Um, they're real journalists and",

Um, they're real journalists and they break real stories and I respect what they do. Um, they also have opinions which I think is good, but Jason especially I don't know understand you know, like I really do feel like Schreier breaks like 75% of the news in the industry of like any consequence that doesn't come straight from a publisher or a press release. Um, Matt Leone is a guy uh at Polygon now who I've never spoken a word to in my entire life and I've never met um but is one of the only other people really the only other person at a big outlet other than me that wrote long form articles and I liked a lot of what he was doing.

Um, so I kind of go uh in that direction and then I want to give my final shout out and this was the this was the most recent edition and this only happened in the last six months or so. I just didn't read Gamespot that much or look at the site. I just just wasn't really interested in it and um until you know this year when I started kind of just reading more and and getting around and what I realized was that Gamespot had their very own Greg and Colin um that I didn't know about Danny and Chris, Daniel O'D and Chris Waters.

I'm impressed with um his ability to get in and out of segments and kind of lead the lead the conversation and direct the conversation. So I want to give a shout out to those two because um they reminded me a great deal of the way Greg and I interact with each other um and I didn't know that they existed really until you know I opened my mind enough to or really even have time to not be in our own trench where I'm like there are other trenches and let's see what what's going on in these other places.

So I didn't but prior to Kinda Funny and like doing this whole thing I didn't know him didn't know of him and all that stuff. I'm I'm very much a YouTube guy like you guys are games journalists and all that stuff and you're so in those trenches. I'm so in the YouTube video trenches and like that's just my group and that's the type people that I am more drawn to cuz I'm looking more for the entertainment instead of the critical analog is and all that stuff right?
