You can see by the third day, I'm sure there's plenty of GIFs around where I'm just like this. And people are nudging me to wake me up. Like, Nick, get up. Somebody said during the Devin Salah interview a whole bunch of GIFs of me reacting to you because I was asking you real questions and you just kept asking bullshit.

I felt bad because we got in a really good role there with Devin where we kind of went through his history, which he always has to do.

I loved it. I thought it was a really, it's one of those movies that's definitely a sign of the times where you go back and it's like, to me it was not on this level, but very much like a Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but for the Nineties, where it wasn't about the like, we can do anything in the Eighties, screw the parents. It was more like, hey, we're sort of like this disenfranchised generation of the Nineties. And we're just basically cheating our way through life because that's what we can do.

I don't think he's coming this year, but we'll never see him again. Like I said, there's restraining orders from him and Brandon Routh now. Routh did not know what he was getting himself into. Not at all. But he was a good sport. Great, great. They were all great sports. Ladies and gentlemen, if you didn't know, this is The GameOverGreggy Show.

I saw it on Drudge and just on AP and stuff, but I was like, I haven't really delved into it. People were talking to me and asking me about it. Can you catch us up on this because I'm not as caught up on this as I should. A young man, a young white man in his early 20s went to a historically black church in Charleston for a Bible reading, sat there for a while actually, for the Bible reading, and started saying things, racially motivated things that killed nine people in the Bible reading, shot a couple of other people.

I don't want to get too much into the crime itself because it's a sad and tragic and awful thing that shows indeed that racism is just certainly not dead in the United States, which distresses me greatly. But there's one specific aspect of the shooting and of where it happened and a symbol of Southern pride for some people. And that's the Stars and Bars, the Confederate flag. Now this isn't, and I don't want to get into the weeds and history. This isn't technically the Confederate flag, that's Robert E. Lee's battle flag, but it's what you know of the Confederate flag.

This is the Dukes of Hazzard on top of the General Lee. And I'm curious about what your guys take is on the fact that in many Southern states, ex-Confederate states, that they still fly this flag and it's actually worked into some of their state flags. In South Carolina in particular, it was just flown by itself outside of the state courthouse or out of the state Capitol, I should say, Capitol buildings.

It reminds me of all these struggles. It reminds me of hicks or people who are going to be racist or all this different stuff. I'm from outside of that though. To a Southern person, I can totally understand the idea that this is something that is pride and heritage and your family had it and you had it in their house and before them, your grandfather. You go further back and obviously you get to eventually the point of Confederacy and this is what it stands for. But then as it goes forward, it does become this thing of Southern pride.

The Confederacy was founded by traitors and was a secession movement started in South Carolina which is why this is especially loaded when you look at South Carolina's history with the Confederate flag. Fort Sumter and all of that happened in South Carolina.

And they left first. So there's history there in terms of the Confederacy and in terms of South Carolina and their role in the Civil War. They were the ones that left first. And then everyone else followed. Six states and then the rest of them later. My big problem with this, having spent a lot of time in the South in places like North Carolina and especially in Virginia, because I've had family in Virginia for a long time, in Richmond especially, and I've told this story before, is that when you go to Richmond there's a thing called Monument Row.

The fact of the matter is Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis and all these guys should have been hanged after the war. The only reason that they weren't was because they were afraid that the Civil War would just never end. So Reconstruction was basically more of a, well, let's just let them.

And it's on a grid of four. And each it squares. The blocks might be four by four, maybe something like that. And the idea is there's different rules, but you're basically bouncing the ball back and forth with each other and trying to hit the ball out so that the other person can't hit the ball.

Rockets is when you hit it and it like would just go straight against the wall without the bounce and stuff. Or sometimes there was rules.

But the thing was is that there weren't a lot of kids in that neighborhood anymore. So we used to just go there after school every day and play Colin Ball and Colin Ball was baseball but with a set pitcher and a set batter and then people in the field and you had basically three outs and you were trying to get points by getting the ball further and further and further and stuff like that. So that was just the game we played. But that was basically just us playing baseball because we had an odd number of people. We couldn't figure it out. Yeah you always had to figure that out right? Like you'd have just you'd have just barely enough people to catch the ball. So you'd have to come up with new rules. We did that.

Kickball's hot which I played the shit out of in Catholic school. Now there's nothing more fun than getting really sweaty in a Catholic uniform that doesn't breathe. Remember those things like cardboard? It was quarter pants. And we used to have these uh uh they were like brown quarter pants and these vanilla colored like taupe colored shirts that were made for I think two reasons. One was for Catholic schools and the other one was for hardcore penitentiaries. I think that like you couldn't shred these things if you wanted to for fear that someone might hang themselves.
