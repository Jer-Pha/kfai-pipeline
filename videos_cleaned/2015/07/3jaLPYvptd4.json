Uh, you guys might remember, uh, a couple months ago, right before Bloodstained was revealed, Koji Igarashi's game, we had him over, um, one of my favorite Japanese developers for an hour and a half conversation about Castlevania and and Konami and just the future of game development and Japanese game development. Well, I'm super, super excited to do this again with another one of my favorite Japanese game developers, creating one of the great Japanese, uh, series of all time. Uh, this is Kazutaka Kodaka, who's writer and kind of visionary, the the concept originator of Danganronpa, uh, which is one of my favorite series of the last few years. So thank you so much for taking the time to be here. Thank you, thank you very much. Um, so I kind of just want to take this free flowing because I I feel like we can learn a lot from you just by speaking with no agenda. Um, it's good. So can you tell us a little bit about",

So can you tell us a little bit about yourself first and and you know, obviously you work for Spike Chunsoft, but what is your experience with games? What is your experience kind of working in the industry and all this? All so originally I dreamed of being working with in film and I wanted to to deal with that. That was my dream. So actually, uh, the Japanese film industry is an even worse place in the Japanese game industry. And um, my goal, my dream was to work and create something original and I could see very early on that I wasn't going to be able to do that in the Japanese film industry. Therefore, I uh, I switched over to games. So you know, originally obviously it was an there was a idea that maybe I could go to Sony or Capcom or Konami, but the truth of the matter is in a company that big, I wouldn't be able to do what I wanted to do.

I wouldn't have the opportunities. So I decided that you know what, let's go for something a little bit, you know, smaller, maybe mid-tier. Well, he says, let's be honest, you know, very small like Chunsoft. So I I entered that company. Uh, I made Danganronpa and um, miraculously it sold and now here I am. So let's get into Danganronpa then because that really was your introduction to the gaming industry. This is kind of what you started out doing. Where did this zany idea originate from? So obviously for my first game, it couldn't be some big budget thing. So I decided to go with a visual novel. So you know, as a PSP game and I was told that the the max sales I could expect from a PSP game that was visual would be maybe 50,000. That said, it didn't necessarily mean that even though I had this idea that my superiors would allow me",

And so in order to to change their mind about visual novels, about the potential of a visual novel, I I look to my uh, my my inspirations like Battle Royale and things like that. And I decided, you know, to go to him, to my superiors and to approach them and to to get the opportunity to make this game. And what was the kind of the embryonic idea in your head about what Danganronpa would be? I mean, obviously it turns into a a game about a kids in a school and a murderous teddy bear. So first and foremost, I wanted to make a mystery game. So you know, there's lots of different kinds of visual novels. And for example, there's something like, you know, Steins;Gate, which I'm not really a big fan of. Uh, and to me, a visual novel is a mystery game. So I thought, how can I make a good mystery game? It would be an",

So I thought, how can I make a good mystery game? It would be an interesting mystery game. And again, one of my inspirations was Battle Royale. And so I thought to myself, what if I combine these together? That would be a really cool mystery game. And so that's what, you know, I ended up creating. So why specifically, I'm kind of curious about this because I think a lot of people are curious about this. And I often notice it in my in my own experiences with Japanese games, which is extensive. What is it about kind of the teenage story or the story of children as opposed to adults that is so appealing, um, as a storyteller? You see that with Persona, you see it with a game like Catherine, you see it, you see it in every like everything in anime. Well, before, well, actually before I uh, you know, when I was making Danganronpa, I never really watched anime before. It really wasn't my thing.",

Well, before, well, actually before I uh, you know, when I was making Danganronpa, I never really watched anime before. It really wasn't my thing. So I'm really not entirely sure. However, um, meaning what do you meant to follow up a little bit earlier? Meaning I I don't know why Japanese people seem to always want to put, you know, uh, the setting for children and things like that. But for me, I wanted to show growth when I made Danganronpa. Therefore, in order to show this feeling of growth, it couldn't be an adult, someone who is, you could say, complete. It needed to be a child that or a young person that could that could show growth. And so also when I was just, you know, thinking about the idea and playing around with the idea, finding uh, the corpse of an old lady or an old guy or the execution scenes for, you know, an old lady and old guy didn't it didn't really strike me as really, you know, something that interesting. And and to talk more to that, um, the idea",

And having that life taken away from them would be more, you know, despair filled, more sad, more impactful to the viewer. And so that that's what I really wanted to go for with this. I saw, you know, this had only broken a few months ago and I had seen it on the internet about Monokuma's original design, which was not as a teddy bear. Where did the inspiration for this particular character come from? And how did you settle on this bizarre teddy bear that's half normal and half kind of evil? To be perfectly honest with you, this whole process of thinking about things in Monokuma, on things like that, it was actually about an hour. So the",

So the idea of, you know, how to make things dramatic and how to do things, there's there's a little bit of, I guess you could say, you know, stealing or plagiarism or forgery involved in this. So first of all, the idea to make Monokuma was the idea of guilty and not guilty, which in Japanese is Shiro, white, not guilty, and Kuro, black, guilty. So we were thinking about it and um, obviously the setting is a school with with, you know, young people and things like that. But the more we thought about the idea, the more we realized that it wasn't interesting. It ended up being too grotesque or something weird. And so we thought, well, what's what's cute? What's interesting? Um, and we thought, well, bear bears are cute, right? Let's let's go with the bear. And so a bear design was drawn. We looked at and said, perfect, let's go with",

We looked at and said, perfect, let's go with that. So like you said, originally it was supposed to be like a a humanoid figure, but um, eventually it turned into to a bear. And so like like I said before, we didn't really like the idea of, you know, it was kind of gross to have like a humanoid figure for this for this bear. So we went with something like, you know, Venom from Spider-Man and something like that. So that's kind of the image that we we came up with. So we talked a little bit about um, using children or young people and how that's kind of resonant with the story. And obviously it would make sense then that um, you know, Trigger Happy Havoc would take place a school. Where did you come up with these these different characters, these different these different Ultimates as they're called in the series? So you know, I really like mysteries and",

So you know, I really like mysteries and looking at mysteries, a lot of times the person who dies in a mystery is someone really unimportant or uninteresting. And that was something that never that I never really, you know, cared for reading this mystery stuff. Therefore, once we had decided we're going to use, you know, young people for the main characters, I wanted to create characters that each one of them was individual, unique, and interesting enough that they could potentially be the main in their own game. So along with this process, there was I challenged myself with the idea that if I'm going to create this character, a new character, I want to think to myself, I could write an entire, you know, short story about this character.

Uh, this is the idea that I came to and this is why all these characters have this incredibly, you know, the Ultimate so on and so forth. Is there an Ultimate in Trigger Happy Havoc that resonates with you most? Um, are there characters that you really either enjoy looking back at or some characters that you wish were maybe a little different or that you scrapped or didn't include at all? Well, actually, I think the most, the one that I like the most, maybe you could say, would be Monokuma. That's because I can write his lines very easily. And you know, this is a question I actually get a lot, but truthfully speaking, I like all of them. And again, that's because when I was",

And again, that's because when I was creating these characters, my whole point was to make characters that were likable by everybody, that were that were really good in and of their own right. And you know, each character within Danganronpa has their own set of fans. And I really think the reason for that is for what I just mentioned, that each character is unique and that I spend time and and, you know, care and thought into each of them. So are there people at Spike Chunsoft, obviously you're kind of the visionary behind the series, but who are you relying on to kind of help you um, flesh out this vision, whether it's artists or or other writers or programmers? Do you have like an intimate inner circle of people that you trust? Yeah, I mean, the the Danganronpa, anything related to Danganronpa is essentially created by one really core team. So for example,",

So for example, the character designer Mr. Komatsuzaki, um, he and I work very closely together. And um, you know, sometimes it takes many revisions for him to create a character that I really, a design rather, that I really like and feel that I I relate with. So he's, you know, kind of, you know, someone very important to the process. And actually, there's times when due to something that he's put into the design, I've changed something in the scenario. And vice versa, due to, you know, something that I've changed in the scenario, I've put in the scenario, he's changed aspects of the character's design. Can you talk a little bit about the juxtaposition between the dark themes of the game? The game is all about murdering other people and getting away with it in order to get away from a teddy bear who wants to murder you. Uh, but can you speak to",

Can you speak to kind of the the murderous scenes and the murder investigations and the darkness of the trials juxtaposed to free time when the music changes and you're walking around and you're just trying to date girls or meet people or learn more about them? That must be an intentional that must be an intentional design decision. So the main point or my main idea on making this is to create a a situation where I can control the player's emotions in in a broad way. That's and those two, I guess you could say, um, ending points of this swinging pendulum would be Despair and Hope. So that, you know, you have your scenes of, you know, like happiness and you're walking in the city and everything's fine and then suddenly you get killed.

And that kind of idea and that kind of setting allows me to create this, you know, this effect. And so the main, so his whole idea was that, uh, what he wanted to create was, uh, this sense of unpredictability. The player wouldn't be able to figure out what's going to happen next. They wouldn't know when it was going to end or how it was going to end. And that's what he was aiming for when he created this. Excuse me. I was going to say one of the, I think, brilliant pieces of Danganronpa is not knowing when your free time is going to end, not knowing if you're wasting time with a certain person that is going to die and you're not going to see their storyline through, et cetera, and so on. Was was did you take some pleasure in writing these characters in the sense that you might you you know when everyone's going to be executed, uh, but did you take pleasure in",

Was was did you take some pleasure in writing these characters in the sense that you might you you know when everyone's going to be executed, uh, but did you take pleasure in kind of being able to write in such a way as to maybe trick some people into spending time with the wrong people to watch them die, et cetera, and so on? Interestingly enough, um, I guess kind of related to your question, I get the question a lot, um, don't you feel a sense of guilt for having killed some characters? But no, I don't feel any whatsoever because I believe that even if a character might die within the midst of the scenario, they're not dead in the hearts of the player. Therefore, what I'm really aiming for with with um, the free time scenes and everything isn't so much, you know, how how I can, you know, fiddle with people's expectations, their emotions, but more the idea, you know, to make a standout character that remains in the hearts and the minds and the player so that no matter what happens, they",

And that's that's what the goal of all of that is. And so actually, even though I'm the one writing it, when I play it myself, sometimes I feel because I'm so invested in these characters myself, you know, like when they die, like, oh my God, what they died, why? I I suppose my next question would be kind of in this in the same vein. What games did you take inspiration from to make it uh, more than just a visual novel? Obviously, it's a very dark game with with interesting characters that you want to get involved in and with and know inspiration. But I see a lot of adventure game or or like, you know, I see pieces of Phoenix Wright for instance, um, in in Danganronpa. What did you pull from any inspiration? Because I I I feel one of the great strengths of Danganronpa is how it radically changes over",

Because I I I feel one of the great strengths of Danganronpa is how it radically changes over and over again from a more free play to a investigation to a trial. How did you kind of just what did you draw from to kind of come to that? Because it's a pretty brilliant mixture. So I definitely obviously have played um, Ace Attorney and that was an interesting game for me. But more than anything else, I was thinking because I had to make, as I mentioned earlier, a visual novel, how to make the most interesting visual novel. But I that that said, just as a on a side note, I mean, even though uh, Ace Attorney is a visual novel, it took a lot of money to make that game. Um, but specifically speaking of Danganronpa, one game that I received a lot of inspiration from was a game called Illbleed and a game, ah, uh, Rare's Conker's games. So I guess you call them, you know, dark humor or black humor. I really like",

So I I would say those are probably my big inspirations. So when you had to deliver um, or you didn't have to, I'm sure you wanted to deliver a second game. And I know that these were released in different sequences in Japan and they were kind of combined on PSP. But did you think when you were making Danganronpa, at least the original story in the school, that you were able to then going to be able to replicate it for a second game that was somewhat similar but also radically different in an entirely new environment? No, I mean, honestly, I really thought that, you know, when I was making one, one was it, that was the only game I was going to be able to make. And even with within like our",

But as soon as that game, you know, Danganronpa 1 started to sell well in Japan, suddenly my superiors told me, hey, how about Danganronpa 2? So um, you know, once once I was told that, I started to work on, I thought, yeah, I can do this. I can make another one of these. And I started making Danganronpa 2. Um, I know it's not come out in America, but actually in Japan, um, after Danganronpa 1, there's a novel that came out called Danganronpa Zero. So what Danganronpa Zero allowed me to do is to kind of look at the scenario one more time, look at things overall, um, put it all together in a way that, you know, made sense to me. And then that allowed",

One of the things that stood out to me most in Danganronpa 2, other than the fact I was just so glad to be playing more of this, was it's radically different setting. It's like a tropical archipelago as opposed to a school. So it's it's instantly wide open as opposed to enclosed in this building. But also the introduction of uh, Monokuma's sister for about Monomi. Um, where did the inspiration for both the setting and this new character come from? So actually when I uh, was given the directive to make Danganronpa 2, I was told, you know what, you can make one, two, and three all in the same style. And this is a direct reaction against that command. So for example, and in order to do this, you know, completely opposite thing, I thought, I'm going to change the characters completely,",

And so all of this, you know, openness within the characters, within the setting, is it's a reaction really against that. And that's that was my goal for this. So what I was also going for was, you know, this idea that even though, you know, it's a game and everything and things, you know, it feels open, but it actually is confined, you know, so this kind of, I guess you could say, contrast and things like that. Um, the idea that getting the player to think that there's more space, there's more everything, but in reality, you know, it is it is more confined once you really look at things closely.

I know you hear a lot from a lot of development teams that they don't want to do the same thing over and over again. Was this kind of a reset for your team to be like, we don't have to make, we will maybe make this game, we'll get to that in a minute, the game that people really are waiting for, but in the meantime, we need to refresh ourselves. Actually, it was more the idea that, you know, obviously people thought, maybe even still think, um, Danganronpa is a visual novel, it's an adventure game. And I I wanted to play with those fans' expectations and those fans' ideas of what Danganronpa was. Honestly, I I don't like giving the users exactly what they want.

I I honestly believe that um, unless the the player's life has changed in some way, I can't really call what I'm doing creativity. That's deep. I appreciate your candor, by the way. Um, Danganronpa, like many other products that come out of Japan, seem somewhat inaccessible to a Western audience, yet Danganronpa has a pretty hardcore audience here in the United",

Um, does that surprise you? Because I know that it took a while for the game to come here, um, like three or four years, um, for at least the first one. Is it surprising to you that this game is extremely popular in a niche, um, audience here in the United States? The fact that where we were at MomoCon in Atlanta, which is a Japanese, uh, anime convention, that people have their Danganronpa gear on there, they're, they're excited about it. Greg bought me a toy down there for Monokuma. Um, are you surprised and happy that this game has found life outside of Japan? Actually, so before I came, um, this year to GDC in March, I didn't really realize that, you know, Danganronpa was doing so well over here. Um, and so I had a lot of interviews with, you know, media over here at GDC.",

And at first, actually, I thought they were speaking sarcastically to me because I only knew that over here the Vita was not doing well whatsoever. So, um, I asked Alan, um, how, how well it was doing, and Alan told me, and, um, I was really surprised. So like I, like I said previously, uh, Tarantino, the director Quentin Tarantino, is a really big inspiration for me. And, um, you know, those kinds of references, those, the jokes that he does, obviously, and the things that he does, um, I tried to replicate within, you know, Danganronpa. And, you know, in, in a very real way, you know, Danganronpa is, is somewhat like a Tarantino creation.

Do you think that, and we were talking a little bit about Japanese, you know, before this, about Japanese gaming in the Japanese gaming industry and the Western game industry, and how there's kind of a ping-pong effect between the two in terms of influences? Does this give you hope that there might not be as many differences between Japanese Gamers and American Gamers as some people read into? Because I personally do not believe that there's many fundamental differences between, we both all want good games. Well, on the one hand, I, uh, I do see what you're saying, but the truth, the truth really is, for, for our team, we're a very, very small team, and we can't even really make you",

So I don't really think about things in touch of, of Gamers. What I do think, though, is that, you know, thinking about the, the price of a game, so, you know, users to users, it doesn't matter how big a budget is, all they want is something that, you know, resonates with them. And, you know, there's a lot of talk nowadays about open world and about, you know, these games of this really grand scale. Um, but to me, what I think would be, what is an effective game or a good game for the user, something to get us out there to hit those users, is to really create something that does resonate with them and really speak deeply to them.

Why does Danganronpa work well on something like PSP or Vita? And is there a future for Danganronpa on consoles, or do you feel like this is something that really needs to be relegated to a handheld experience? And if so, why does it work so well as a handheld? That's actually, to be perfectly frank with you, that's more a matter of the amount of budget I'm given from the company. Honestly, as a creator, I want to make something for PS4. But, you know, looking at the, the sales numbers of Danganronpa 1 and 2 in Japan, um, that kind of determined that, you know, Ultra Despair Girls would be on Vita.

That's to make a game that is only like Danganronpa. I've buried the lead for a lot of people out there that really want to know about Danganronpa 3. Um, obviously, uh, Ultra Despair Girls is, I guess, the third Danganronpa game.
