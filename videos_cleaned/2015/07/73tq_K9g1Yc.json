            "text": "What's up, Chas Alexander, the Kinda Funny crew. Yes, yes, Chas, thank you so much for supporting us all this time. Now here's where we jump into all your personal data. Now Chas' another one of these guys, no no Twitter link, just the Patreon page. He's just a, he's a mystery man. Google Chas, see what happens. Just, just Chas, not even Alexander. Is he spell Alexander? That's how he spells it. Is it Chase? Maybe that'll make it easier for us to find. Oh man, he's well, well, could it be Fox McCloud? I bet you it's Fox McCloud. It's probably Fox McCloud. He doesn't follow Tim, so that makes it harder. Does he follow Greg Miller? That would make it easier. Let's see who he's following here. President Obama, that's his most recent follow. Yeah, that's the problem. He's probably been following Greg Miller forever. You know, he's probably one of them OG Greg Miller followers, so it'll be hard to track it down. Should we make the assumption that he's following a lot of fine ladies? This is he, well, he's, he's okay in my book then I",

This is he, well, he's, he's okay in my book then. I think we might as well, we got nothing to lose. All right, Chas, we're just going to assume this is you. He spells this with a Z, Z. Yeah, I mean, all I'm say, let's see what his images are, 'cause again, he's following a lot of fine, fine young ladies here, so maybe got some fine retweets for us to look at. It does that say 101,000 tweets? Yes, that's what it says. Wow, he impressive. He has 1,300 followers, is well above the average. \"Guess I'll just go to sleep,\" he said on May 30th. \"Bored as ****,\" he said on May 30th. Man, he said \"Bored AF,\" which means that's ****. Get with the kids, bro. Yeah, but maybe he meant \"Bored as fine.\" It's as, it's as in, \"It's fine with me that I'm bored.\" What if this isn't him though? I think he should link to Twitter so we didn't have to go through of anal sex on May 9th. He says, \"Be too drunk for this.\"",

I think he should link to Twitter so we didn't have to go through of anal sex on May 9th. He says, \"Be too drunk for this party.\" I hear that. He also said on May 9th, he also said, \"Oh, you Iron Chest Charlie.\" Oh, Charlie. Man, Chas, for, I want to know more. We all want to know more. Backp. He's got a love direct. But are you a different animal and the same beast? Instagram. Could the Instagram possibly give us any clues? We can try. Man, this is fun. I like these thank you videos become murder mystery videos. He put jetlife.org on. What do you think that is? Jet. Hopefully that's a whis or uh, Jet Magazine currency website. Jetty currency. Say, \"Wait, why is there so many names for Charles, Chuck, Charlie, Chas, Chucky, commentary, Chippy, Chippy, Ch, short for Charles, kind of cheating.\" Then you say Chester. I, I think Chester is a whole different family. I like Chester. I just like that name. Oh, Chester's cool. Makes me feel right. Yeah, this user is",

He's like, \"That's not me!\" He's screaming at the thing, \"That's not!\" This is the best we could do. We tried, guys. I'm, I'm only half convinced that that's really him. You have 3,750 Good Karma on Patreon, so that's cool. What does that mean? I have no idea. That's like one of those things that's on Patreon that I've known, but it sounds good. Yeah, exactly. Doesn't. Good on you, Chas, whatever. Thank you, Chas, for supporting us in two to three months. I hope we see more information here on your Patreon, P, your pile, so we know what we're talking about. Patreon pile. Chas, make sure to give us more information so that I don't have to weave tales about who I think you are or read Twitter accounts that I'm",
