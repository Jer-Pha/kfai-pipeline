My name is so very pleased and excited today to introduce you, Kakaka from Spike Chunsoft Japan, the writer and or kind of visionary for my series of All Time. Name thank you, thank you very much, thank you very much. I went to Anime Expo to come here, please come and like for that and I always drop by and I hope to play more Danganronpa games in the future. Thank you. Have us talk. We're in the game comes out, I think September in the West North America. What is this game? What is it called and what is it? So let's start by giving a simple introduction to the game. Yes it's a game called Danganronpa: Ultimate Despair Syndrome which is an absolute spin-off of the Danganronpa series. This time unlike previous adventure games it's an action adventure game. However the selling points of the Danganronpa series are the story and the characters so it's a rare type of action adventure with a lot of overlapping stories. Guys approP Why is it that this time it's the third game to appear and why isn't it a normal adventure game",

Guys approP Why is it that this time it's the third game to appear and why isn't it a normal adventure game but an action game? Well generally speaking when you say spin-off it's usually made cheaply using the budget or rather the materials of games that have been made up until now but if you do that it's not very normal or rather boring so we thought we'd give it a try making an action game ourselves. So yeah gener Speaking from BUDisfairlyCheapon development LAD that said he really wanted to create an ACTION GAME ACTION Excuse me sode What wanted to do so where does this take place in the war OB seeing ONE FAM character where do this take place GU Happy andareitasequis So where does it fit in as a series? Well it's basically between 1 and . Let me give you a brief introduction to the series. Well in the end of Danganronpa 1 the outside world is in ruins or rather that kind of place is collapsing.

Well in the end of Danganronpa 1 the outside world is in ruins or rather that kind of place is collapsing. What on earth is the world like? That came up in the words but it didn't come out in the pictures so it's centered around that and the story is about a character called Fukagawa Higashi one of the survivors of the World and the younger sister of Uchi Makoto the main character of the World and how these two girls stand up to this world of despair. So as you know the World We told that but we not SH that and so we wanted to go ahead and show that in this game he wanted to show the outside WORLD and What it did become and to do that he decided to Bring Back from the first GAME and as well as introduce The First Game S their Journey through this you WORLD like the Real World of p so How did you SLEon bringing back this specific All to Ah well Daga has a lot of great characters but why did",

Ah yes I really like killers so I wanted to make an action game about them. The name of the game is Murderer a killer called Genocide. No it's Genocider isn't it? Gsequence Now we're seeing more b third person ACTION sequence with GEN jacking her scissors to Attack manumaclones I know what in melee Action and earlier we were playing with games What is the flow of the game like? There is a story sequence and then the action and so on. Could you please explain a bit about that? Well the basics are that you progress through the game and when you reach a certain point the story progresses so in a sense it's like a good old fashioned action adventure but Dagonronpa fans are mostly not fans of action games but visual novels so in that sense the story is very rich and the action game parts",

You can do that right? So this game has that kind of element of replayability but rather than that you can meet other characters and make relationships and there are various books that are dropped in various towns and when you pick up those books the conversation between you and Deep expands and also as I mentioned earlier the surviving flesh of the first game is in various places in the towns and there is a list of where they are and by picking it up you can see the story and the sub-stories. I see right? That will deepen relationships SHOW more personal so as The Game you find of characters that will be familiar to players who play the previous Games locate them again like Are you Grand enem EM All up until now it was just the biggest one",

Yes that's right you're controlling these Mokumas But the children are really children aren't they? In this town the setting is that children are using Monokuma to kill adults and they are controlling the Monokuma clan so you defeat Monokuma but you also have to fight those children. Will they also appear in the second game? Well it's a bit of a spoiler so I'll just say that I'm very grateful for that. I have there again more than one.

Yes that's right. There are stickers in various places that say they are the players of hope for the children who are controlling this town of hope. They are hidden and by collecting them you can get Monokoma medals which change the movie scenes so there is a lot of depth to that. Yes what is this time's Moma?

Yes when I thought about what it is that is most despairing about this city being a city of despair I thought it was normal for a grown man to kill someone and I wondered what the most hopeless situation would be and I first thought it would be a world where children are constantly killing adults.

No no ... There's a novel about people killing each other and I don't know what it's like in this genre but I see that was originally a Western book right? Yes yes I said that was one of the things that was in the game for PS and it was like a game where kids are constantly killing each other and to be honest I thought this game could be released in that format but I felt like I wanted to push the boundaries because it's the kind of era we live in and I wanted to create a world view like that as well.
