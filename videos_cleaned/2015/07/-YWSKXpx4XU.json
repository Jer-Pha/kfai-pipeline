I'm doing six year old things like beating Crash Bandicoot. Okay, never beat this game. Yeah, so we streamed all day. Yeah, see if I could beat it. Yeah, now the problem was I could have beat it. You got really close. I did three levels away. Okay, but then we ran out of time just because we have to shoot some other static. Oh, Hot Pepper Gaming. Yeah, things happen.

Okay, I need to get back in the groove. Sure, that's the hardest part about putting on a game like this that you've been, you know, you're in the moment, your reflexes are honed. Yeah, you're on the right mindframe. Then you got to go home. Oh God, we got to jump dinner with your dumb girlfriend. Oh my God, we're in a hurry, we're in hurry. Yeah, I want to get in your head.

Yeah, but now this all still so foreign to me. Ain't not, you see, you say that what you're looking pretty good. You're looking nice. You're looking really good right now as you go. I'm feeling loose. Oh, go tighten up. But yeah, so I'll be playing this is like, oh, I definitely won't wake you Crash 2. You're Crash, the ones that I've always said are better than this. This game's needlessly hard. Yeah, it's a Naughty Dog learning the ropes. Yeah, the Crash franchise. See, they got some tricks over here that I learned from last time as I died.

How nice. F***in'-A. I'll never hear the scream. This is, this game is so frustrating. I applaud you for sticking with it. Even as a kid when the game was really frustrating me to the point where I wanted to kill him like, nice. I like them. I would like, you know, be done with them. I'm not gonna put up with that crap.

Okay, so audio. Damn, bro. I don't know like that. This or Jell-O? All right, cool, 'cause we're gonna be at it a while. This term is less. The Wilhelm Scream. The Wilhelm Scream is a stock sound effect that has been used in more than 300 movies beginning in 1951 for the film Distant Drums. The scream is often used when someone a shot falls from a great height or a stone from an explosion and is most commonly used in films and television. Dargos. Oh, that was good timing. Good job.

No, you can't. You can't run on boxes. If you jump on the boxes, you bounce. Now, this is the problem with this game. I'll kinda sides the controls. It's the depth. Yeah.

I'm going to bet there's a pocket hole. Oh, yeah, there's for sure hope. Yeah, you can't walk off box three onto the platform.
