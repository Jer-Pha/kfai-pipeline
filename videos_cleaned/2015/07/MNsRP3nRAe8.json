      "text": "Greetings and salutations, welcome back to Kinda Funny games. I'm Colin and this is Tim. Tim, we had some unfortunate news this past weekend. Satoru Iwata, president of Nintendo, longtime Nintendo employee, been there and bouncing around different developers including this very high laboratories uh for 30 years. Um, he passed away. Uh, we figured the best way to celebrate the man because everyone has poignant things to say about him, right? They're saying all the right things and we appreciate that. We how can we contribute to that? Well, let's just celebrate one of his games. This is Kirby's Adventure. It's a very late NES game came out in 1993. How Laboratory uh put it together and he produced this game. So I figured that I figured that we would uh just play through it a little bit and just kind of remember this game and how good it was and of course maybe this is our best way we can sync up with Iwata and pay him our respects. Yeah, it's crazy to think about it man 1993 a new NES game coming out like",

Yeah, it's crazy to think about it man 1993 a new NES game coming out like the that means the Super Nintendo has been out how many years couple years at that point so like that's that's insane like I I was never the biggest Kirby fan um like playing the games cuz I I always felt like they were just like a little too easy and I felt like I wasn't the exact audience um but then after playing Smash Bros and you know obviously Sakurai and a lot of the the creators of Smash Bros worked on Kirby as well right yeah Sakurai directed this game yeah and um you can see the influence and when you play it it's like it feels like Smash Bros like the physics of it and everything about it and it's it made me appreciate the game a lot more and um you getting all the powerups and then just the way the jumps work and all that stuff it's funny that when you use Kirby and Smash Bros it",
