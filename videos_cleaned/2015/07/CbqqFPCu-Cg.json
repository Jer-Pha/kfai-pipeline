So if you're at San Diego, we have a bunch of stuff you can come do with us and you don't even have to have a Comic-Con badge. On Thursday, we're going to Polite Provisions. We're doing a meet and greet there 5:00 p.m. You don't need a Comic-Con badge. You do need to be 21. Don't blame me, those are the drinking laws in the United States of America. Friday, we're doing the GameOverGreggy Show at Petco Park as part of Geek and Sundry Studio stage. No Comic-Con badges required. We're doing that at 3:00 p.m. And then I'm moderating a whole bunch of Comic-Con panels if you do have a ComiCon badge. So come hang out with me in the convention center. All the details are up on kindafunny.com news, so head over there for the full rundown. What's your topic? So my topic is what is the most extravagant thing that anyone's ever done for you? Extravagant plan, extravagance just",

Extravagant plan, extravagance just what is something that's just blown your mind because you've been like, I can't believe someone would do this for me in any way. It could be good, it could be bad, it could be whatever, just extravagant. The reason I bring this up is because this weekend was my birthday and my girlfriend came up with this with this ridiculous plan where on Saturday the entire day she had me like it was essentially a scavenger hunt where I was going all around the Bay Area doing all types of is she with you stuff? She was not with me. She was not with me because so there's there's a bit of a story that goes with this.

Wait, we should preface with this was a lot more positive than Gone Girl, not necessarily. So there's a girl that was uh possibly dead and it looked like the her husband killed her and there was just a bunch of clues set around of like what happened to her, right? And like he was just trying to figure out is she dead, is she not dead, all that stuff, right? And he had she Gone Girl, the girl was gone.
