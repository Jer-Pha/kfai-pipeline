So I've been thinking a lot about elementary school recently just because that's type of life that I live and um, you know, I was thinking he's got to go to the bathroom. God, Nicky, Nick, I'm sorry. Okay, go for it. Just do it. I can hear the talk. No, you can't. You always say stuff you you can't come back. Like what are we talking? Are you here's what I want to know. Are you going to get a cup of coffee and a water too? Do you want some help? Okay, we cut. No, just let to go. Just cut this part out. I'm or leave this in. I'm care. Fast forward. Oh, Colin, settle. Ah, we're four-year-olds. Did you like the timing? Yeah, that really good. What's your topic? What's your topic? My topic is elementary school, but specifically the the games and the sports that we would play. So I'm talking things like Tetherball, Handball, Four Square, Kickball was the shit. You know, uh, maybe little War Ball, little Dodgeball, whatever the hell you guys called it. Bombardment, Bombard. That's what you guys",

All right, so I'm going to introduce you guys to a little piece of my life. It was called Nine Square. Now I know if you I don't know if you guys are aware aware, Four Square is a fun game and I like Four Square. I respect Four Square. Shit things exactly. Do you guys know what Four Square is? I remember I don't know Four Square. So Four Square and Nine Square were Greg does not know Four Square. Sorry. All right, so I'll explain Four because Four Square was not on Long Island.

When I when I moved to New England for you know, in my in my early years when parents got divorced for a little while, that's when I learned Four Square and Nine Square. Four Square is a game played with a bouncy ball and it's on a grid of four and each it's squares. The blocks might be 4x4, maybe something like that, 5x. And the idea is there's different rules where but you're basically bouncing the ball back and forth each other and trying to hit the ball out so that the other person can't hit the ball. So you have to hit the ball like in their square and they have one bounce and then they hit into another square. And so it's Pong kind of, but you're humans instead of paddles. Okay, so there's four people. There's four. Okay, so it's a fun game. But when I moved to York, Maine and I went to an elementary school there, this was in fourth grade or fifth grade.

It is very cold up there. So cold and minty. But it's a nice, it's a Beach Community, whatever. Anyway, we would play this game called Nine Square. And this was a thing. It Nine Square was Four Square with nine people, nine squares. And there was a square in the middle who's the server and then it was surrounded by a grid. So it look like it looked like Dr. Wily's like Stage 8 screen. Wait, so there was actual courts for this made or did you like? No, there was courts made for this. Really? Yeah. Holy crap. Like people like painted and all this kind of stuff. And the person in the like if you made it all the way to the Center Square, you to serve a the ninth square and then you would serve the",

People would get back in line and wait to get back into the first square and then work their way back through the grid. I shit loved that game. I'm tell you, I loved that game so much. And when I moved from Maine then to New Hampshire, no one played it there anymore. Did you introduce? No, no, no. Because at this point there was other games that people played, you know, and that was also I moved to New Hampshire. So it was fourth, fifth, and sixth grade, I think in Maine.

So no one played it on Long Island. I didn't even try to bother introducing every. We were too busy playing shit street hockey anyway, right? Uh, a real man's hobby. We were actually technically playing roller hockey. We wouldn't play on foot. That shit was for pansies. Um, and then uh, I I tried when I went to New Hampshire. I lived I lived in Dover, New Hampshire. And this was just a 10-minute drive from York, Maine. It was like another world. They had no idea what the shit I was talking about with Nine Square or Four Square. And we played other games, right? But Nine Square, that was the shit game.

I would think that dumb and I would have made fun of you 'cause there's a lot of games like that just require a wall, you know? So there was for us there was Handball and Wall Ball. Wall Ball is that when you would peg people? Wall Ball is when you just no, that's just when you just hit it against the wall like straight against the wall. But what was the game when you threw a racquetball or a tennis ball against the wall and a bunch of people and you tried to catch it?

But like other people, they they like Peg. It was like horrifying because painful because like you didn't go after the ball unless you knew you could catch it. And then sometimes it would bounce off your hand. You would shit run like lightning towards the wall before you got pegged with a shit racquetball at like 100 miles an hour. It's a weird, weird, weird things kept me entertained. Anyway, we used to we used to play Ball, but I didn't play uh, I I never liked like hitting a racquetball or a squash ball with my hand. We also played it with the bouncy ball. Did you guys? Yeah, no, so Handball is with the bouncy ball and then you have to hit it so that it bounces on the floor first. It's like racquetball",

Racquetball rules where you hit it, it has to bounce against the wall once and then you got that was always that was always a lot of fun. Uh, you'd always have the people that tried to actually play Handball, which is like Handball where you actually playing racquetball with your hand. That's an actual sport. It's actually really popular on the East Coast. I don't know why, but it is. Um, couldn't do that. That took way too much concentration. But the big bouncy ball where you go, you'd come down on it real big and try to get it to arc over the person's head. That was always a blast. Yeah, I mean, it's just so funny 'cause I remember there's all these like stupid. It's like no Rockets.

What did you did you guys ever play uh, what's the game uh, Three Flies Up, Three Fly where you one person has the football and they just hurl it into the air and whoever catches it then gets to throw it? Oh, no, we played 500 or whatever. Was that 500? Was that you yell at the points value? This is 500 and you throw into a crowd of people and it was just you're shit. It was a mosh pit of shit boys yelling at each other, the eyeballs. Everyone would always lose an eye every summer.

So if you tumble down the other side, you're on the sidewalks of Glen Allen, head cracked open, blood everywhere. Did you guys? I'm I'm curious. You know, these were these were these were Summer Games, more nighttime Games, Neighborhood games. But on Long Island, I grew up in a cul-de-sac that was like in the middle of the woods.

And we'd have friends over and we'd play uh, Manhunt. Oh yeah, which one was Manhunt? Uh, also known as Ghost in the Graveyard. Uh, Manhunt was like hide-and-seek at night. Both terrifying and it was horrifying. It was always scary. It was awesome. Like you had but the parameters were insane because you'd have like it would be after a barbecue, July 4th. Everyone would be over. There'd be like 15 people playing, you know? And it was like nine or 10 at night. I don't know what the shit our parents were thinking. Uh, but this was like the late 80s.

And you could only play like one cycle of it. And the idea was to be able to it was usually I think my stoop because I lived in the first house where you had to get to the stoop and no like and people would chase you and they'd have like so it was like teams of two and people would like be posted up to like try to make sure you could never get there.

And you didn't want to get caught because you got caught, you had to just sit on the stoop and just watch, just wait. And you just waited and it took it took hours, you know? I definitely I think that people still do it because uh, where I live, I live in this kind of like gated community thing. And there's like a bunch of little kids. No, it's like a shitty gated community, but like it's gatedness. There was a pool and rec center.
