Nick, yeah, you and I are still in love with Arkham Knight. I am very much so. I can't stop playing. I want all the Riddler trophies. Hopefully, I'm getting close. We're obviously time has passed when we film this, when it posts, right? I hope I have them. I hope you have them out too. I hope you have them and you get to experience all the game has to offer. Thank you with those. Thank you very much. It's good to know you're in my corner. Uh, yesterday you played the Red Hood Story Pack here on Kinda Funny Games. Today I'm going to jump in and play the Harley Quinn one. What's interesting, uh, it has a little bit of information about the story here. Of course, we play this for the first time ever, whatever, but then it says we're wreaking havoc in the Bl\u00fcdhaven Police Department with her unique weapons, guidance, and abilities.
