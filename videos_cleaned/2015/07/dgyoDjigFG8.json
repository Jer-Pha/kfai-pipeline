And what I was so surprised about with this is that you actually heard of this game. It's a pretty obscure game. This is one of those games that this was like the the gift at school that was like, oh, you read your your weird anamorphs book for 30 minutes during reading time, now you get to go play this PC game. Then you would go and you play this and every kid was like, you know, there's the one guy I was really good at it and I beat Chip's Challenge. I've overcome the challenge. And then there was me that was just like, I never got that far, but I remember playing the hell out of this game. I remember I so I really loved Chip's Challenge as well. Um, and it's funny that you played it in school cuz I never played it in school. It came with a computer that I got when my my parents bought me uh or my mom bought me a Sony VIO in 1996. Wow, it was $300. I'll never",

My God, $300 in 1996, beautiful Sony VIO computer and it came with loaded with all sorts of games and this was one of them and this was like, oh yeah, of course. Oh yeah, uh there were a few games that stuck out to me. One was that pinball game, the Galactic Pinball, what the heck called and then it was this wizard was it called pinball Wiz? No, no, it was it was Interstellar Pinball or I don't know something. I know exactly what you're talking about though. There were literally like 60 games on this thing that were like Mech Warrior and all this stuff and I was like I was like no no no I'm going to play Chip's Challenge. So Chip's Challenge was um it's it's a puzzle game and the entire idea is to pick up these chips and find keys and all sorts of clues and the the game's actually quite simple",

Yes, um but the entire idea this is crazy just looking at this like seeing the portal and seeing all this stuff my God yeah and I don't all right so so for some context I don't even I don't remember anything about this game like in terms of like how to beat the puzzles and stuff like that. It's probably been at least 15 years if not more since I have played Chip's Challenge. Yeah yeah why not so and there's all these little question mark things where it's like push blocks to into water to make dirt so for people that don't know Chip's Challenge originally came out in 1989 it was uh by a developer called oh yeah so it's old as you it's a developer uh or by a developer called Epics um and it's all played on the D-pad",
