Good lord, my topic is candy. I don't know what you guys' thoughts are in candy, what your favorite candy is, and just if you have any any stories about candy. The reason I bring this up is it's weird, but it's like I know, but like I'm sure you have some like candy is such a it's a thing that is a big deal when you're little, and then as you grow up it becomes less of a thing, but then then you see things like Sweet Factory and like all these like candy places that people lose their **** for. Like Nick, I've never heard of Sweet Factory. Oh man, Natalie's candy in the and they own out in the airport. We're just just can sugar smell. Yeah.

No, it's in the family. I am less of a candy person, but I will just strangle a white KitKat to death. This is my new jam and these are the things that like I found the other day I went to a movie and died my life's like you gotta try these white KitKat so good white chocolate guys and I was like oh man, Kit Kats are like perfect alright you don't need to change that, but they changed it and they took it to the second level and it's so good.

My entire world would be about saving enough money for on a Saturday table to go to a movie get a giant Coke and go to the they used to became the candy saloon in Riverside, California. So it was called because it was more like a Western theme. I used to go and I would get just a giant king size Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. So like there was like the four of them and then I would probably get some combination of Twix bars and I thought Kit Kats on there too. It was like a Taco Bell order. I'm like I just I need to have the right mixture of candies and of course I'd get a giant popcorn also no wonder that I was overweight as a child no wonder we are peelers happy to have you out of the house she was like just taking who cares but no my wife my wife is much",
